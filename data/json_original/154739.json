Well this hotel ticked every box! The beach was just amazing and the sea was gorgeous! Every day the staff would collect the seaweed and dig a hole to get rid of it, they worked so hard! The food was good, we went for 2 weeks so there was repetition but there was always something we liked to eat. The steak house is definitely worth a visit. The Mexican is okay but expected more. We had a perfect room, right next to the pool. The beds are fine, yes they are firm but actually it was really nice to lay on. The amount of space in the bed is so nice too! Massive beds. Room number was 5115. Yes it was noisy at night, but after all your on holiday so should be sitting out enjoying the entertainment which was definitely worth a watch. The Michael Jackson show was just amazing, like no entertainment i have seen before! They put on a circus show aswel one night and well, you would expect to have to pay for it, amazing! The animation team worked so hard! Entertaining throughout the day, aswel as rehersing for the evening show to then presenting the evening show at night. They deserve a massive thank you as they made our holiday. The wildlife around the hotel is so nice, with monkeys coming down and holding onto your hand, coati's that are so cute, iguanas and more. They were never a bother. We did a few day trips, the best one we did was quadbiking. Go across to the Riu Tequila just after the archway on the right and book with them, they lead you straight out of the hotel on the quadbikes - you even go through the streets and towns experiencing how the Mexican people live! Best quadbiking trip i have done! We also went speedboating which was fun as you get to drive your own two person speedboat. We even saw a crocodile! This trip was nice as you got to see how the Mexican people lived. We also spent the day at Xel-Ha, absolutely gorgeous! We also swam with dolphins here and again it was the best dolphin excursion i have done. The final trip we did was Xplor, it was okay but we expected a lot more. It is a good trip to experience once as the whole park is built either under or over the ground. Kia our Thompson Rep was so helpful and always had an answer to any question. They also have a swap box so if you need any extra bits you can get these, then if you have things left over that you don't want to weigh your suitcase down with, you can leave them in the swap box. Clever idea. Overal it was a really nice holiday, I would definitely recommend this hotel and all the trips we went on.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "RAMSGATE KENT", "Title": "\u201cMexico March 2012\u201d", "Author": "sawatson64", "ReviewID": "UR126545435", "Content": "just returned from our 3rd trip to the riu yucatan, the last time we went in 2008 there wasnt any beach left, what a difference the beach has been reclaimed and looks great again, even walked along the beach to the port in playa car, extremely hot so take extra sun lotions (went through 9 bottles!)as very expensive there, you must visit the Asian Restaurant at the yucatan its lovely , didnt go much on the steak house I had a plateful of gristle when we went, unfortunately we didnt realise the first week was spring break for the Canadians/Americans and boy oh boy can they be loud!! had a lovely quite room block 3 far away from the entertainment so no noise can be heard, enjoyed seeing the monkeys in the trees again always great to see, take beach shoes if you are going walking along the shore I cut my toe badly on the 1st day. alll in all had a GREAT 2 WEEKS , was told to take mexican pesos which we did but euros and american dollars are accepted, mind you better value when you buy anything and pay in pesos, I always have a problem with the pillows being too stuffed so now I go prepared with sharp scissors and needle and thread and remove what ! dont need !

We stayed at Riu Yucatan from Sunday - Saturday. Both check-in and check- out went smoothly. The staff were amazingly helpful and friendly. The resort grounds were very clean. The beach was perfect for both sand (volleyball) and water (boogie boards, kayaks, sail boards) sports. We were always able to find beach and poolside lounge chairs. We brought our own thermal mugs which saved trips to the cantinas and were eco-friendly. The resort had an evening show each night - the shows we saw were entertaining. We especially liked the Michael Jackson show. The resort had three \"special\" restaurants - reservations were required but only available for same day seating. The Asian restaurant was a favorite; steakhouse was ok; Mexican restaurant was unremarkable - probably not worth getting up early for reservations. The dinner buffet was extensive - we always found something tasty (the homemade chips, guacamole, and pico de gallo was awesome). The rooms were adequate. The beds were hard; the temperature a bit warm, and the bathroom had a wet floor. We only got enough towels if we asked everyday. There was a family of monkeys that liked to growl very loudly at about 5:00 am outside one of the families' windows. We have stayed at four other resorts in this area. Although this was our least favorite resort, it was pleasant, had fun activities and decent food. We had a very enjoyable vacation.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cI love Mexico\u201d", "Author": "Amanda S", "ReviewID": "UR126402249", "Content": "The hotel was lovely - usual RIU standards.

I know it's long haul and the flight of eleven hours might put some off going, particularly for some winter sun, but I can assure you this hotel is worth the time, money and effort. Our room was comfortable, spotless and cleaned to a very high standard every day, the grounds are kept beautiful by the gardeners (be prepared for howler monkeys in the trees, and other wildlife wandering around - don;t worry nothing dangerous, it just adds to the charm). Food is freshly prepared with plenty of choice including steak, Mexican and Oriental speciality restaurants, waiters really friendly and nothing is too much trouble, very efficient service in all the bars (cocktails, shots and international spirits are all part of the all inclusive package as are optics dispensing rum, vodka, gin plus lemonade, pepsi etc in the rooms). The evening entertainment/dance shows are very professional with a Mariachi band playing after the show till late on several nights, The hotel is set in a secure area so no worries about daytime or late night walks to go shopping, sightseeing, visiting other Riu hotels nearby - Playacar is about 25 mins walk either along the beach or the road - a taxi costs about \u00a34 each way. Be warned souvenirs etc are not as cheap as you might think! So, if you are after hot weather, plenty of sunshine, good food, service, entertainment and value for money in a safe environment then the Riu Yucatan might be just the place to go. However, be warned this is not the place for a quiet chill out holiday since the Yanks can be a bit \"loud\" particularly during the day round the pool and sometimes when returning to the hotel after a late night in town.

The service provided by staff here is simply superb; we had a couple of problems that were addressed immediately (ceiling fan didn't work, turned out we weren't pressing the right combination of switches, TV didn't work, they swapped it out. Still didn't work but it didn't affect our stay too badly!) Things you need to be aware of, the bugs here as mean as the devil himself! I was bitten twice on my right calf on our FIRST night, which then led to a cellutitis infection meaning that I couldn't walk for 4 days, had to delay our excursions and spent 5000 pesos (just over \u00a3250) on medical treatment. So make sure that you get bug spray as soon as possible, or ask them to spray your room in advance of your arrival. They do not have zappers in the rooms, though by god they'd be a benefit. My wife was similarly chewed on and had a very irritating reaction, though fortunately it wasn't as bad as mine. So watch out for those, the bugs aren't necessarily big but you definitely feel them bite! Incidentally, the doctor here is VERY good and took very good care of me! He was expensive (check your insurance excess before you go!) though was fluent in english and easy to understand. He did everything to ensure that my treatment was painless as possible which is great for a needle phobic such as myself. He does cover multiple hotels in the area though so take a deck of cards or a book while you wait. The food was mostly above average in the main Hacienda restaurant (this being where all 3 meals are served) - I didn't have a massive problem with runny eggs, frankfurters and lumps of crispy bacon until the 4th day. There is a damn good selection of food to be had, though it doesn't really change. I thought we'd struck gold when they served sausages good enough to pass an english mans tastes, though they were never seen again after that! The Steak House a la carte restaurant is exactly where you want to be, though you need to be prepared to queue from the very early hours to get a seat; they have 2 sittings of approximately 20 tables and these are filled up in no time. The chinese a la carte restaurant is also very good quality though the selection isn't as varied as you may expect. Drinks are mostly superb; a useful phrase for those on soft drinks is \"menos hielo, por favor\" (Less ice please) as the ice melts in no time and just waters your drinks down. They FILL the cup with ice, so that's a pretty tasteless pepsi when watered down! Service is fast, even in the evenings when the bars are swamped and the staff always smile. The Animacion Team did a good job to say that they were catering to 3 or 4 different languages at a time and there was plenty going on (we lounged instead of taking part though). The evening shows were a liiiiittle dull after a while as it was mostly pressing play on a CD player and dancing / miming (usually badly) to the sound track of Grease, Moulin Rouge, Abba back catalogue etc... Essentially very cheesey, not very entertaining but a good way of killing those evening hours. HOWEVER, it's worth remembering that the team is dealing with a multi cultural audience so I'm not sure they could have done much more, though a live band playing the tracks would have been preferable to a cd player, just to add a little more skill to be appreciated! They were always cleaning too! The beach, the pool, the reception, anywhere you can think of there was always someone cleaning there! We had a bad experience with Scuba Caribe, the on site water sports company. They're a PADI certified dive centre, though didn't give us enough weights to keep us down, so both of us had little or no control over our depth. My wife was hand held all the way round until I signalled that I was in the red zone on air (due to having to fight hard to stay down and over exerting myself). Our guide, Carlos, let go of Linz to deploy his rescue kite (an inflatable rocket that shoots out of the water to bring the boat to you). In lettign go of her though, she rose straight to the surface without any breaks to equalize, and putting her in danger of lung over expansion - she had no way to prevent the ascent, though Scuba Caribe did, before we went down. I should also mention that when we broke the surface (I raced after her) we were surrounded by ket ski's and were in danger of being hit. So not a great dive company and I'd recommend against using them - they had our lives in their hands and failed to provide adequate protection. Our guide hid himself away in a back office after the dive as he knew he'd failed, I didn't get chance to complain at the time as no one else spoke enough english to understand me though I will be complaining to PADI directly about them. So there we are, the hotel's great, the food not so much though is at least edible, the bugs are evil, and the scuba guys give bad advice and won't look after you! On the whole though, I've given Riu Yucatan a 4/5 as Scuba Caribe are not part of them directly, and there was always something to be eaten that you could like!", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSomething for everyone!\u201d", "Author": "jp222", "ReviewID": "UR126258273", "Content": "We booked direct through the hotel since I had found an amazing flight deal on my own. Reservations were no problem at all, gave them my credit card and request a suite close tot he pool and beach. Arrive in Cancun, we had a private car service pick us up since shuttles are a pain and they sometimes drop off at various hotels which takes forever. Check in was fast, maybe 10 mins or so and we were taken to our room. The hotel was beautiful! The grounds lush green with tropical flowers and gardens all over. The staff was really nice, everyone welcoming with a smile. We even saw monkeys in the trees and these giant hamster looking creatures! Welcome drink refreshing, a great start to the holiday. Our room was on the 2nd floor, facing pool, palm trees and some of the ocean. The suite was big, roomy entrance with giant mirror in hallway. big living room, comfy couch, TV, mini bar with some bottles of rum, vodka, glasses. The mini fridge had pop, water and beer restocked daily. The shower was great, nice roomy tub for two. Very clean. The bedroom was nice too, comfortable bed, I did ask for a few extra pillows and that was no problem with just a phoen call down tot he front desk. The balcony was a decent size, few chairs, nice breeze, very relaxing : ) The food was awesome! We just ate at the buffet since it was so big and full of such variety. There are restaurants at this resort but we didn't try them. The buffets were awesome. SO much great food. The fish was great, meats all well prepared, seafood galore, fresh vegetables, fruits, breads, pastas, you name it. The coffee was really good in the morning and the bar next to the pooll serves some amazing drinks. try the brandy alexander and the mango slushies. The beach was awesome, water so crystal blue and soft white sand. We need some parasailing which was fantastic and lots of sun baking and swimming. The beach was a nice mix of young, old, some kids, etc. We felt comfortable and relaxed the whole time there. Gift shops were nice, lobby bar was great too, all open and airy with ocean breezes.

This was our third trip to this area and we chose this resort because of it's close proximity to Playa Del Carmen. The last 2 trips we stayed farther south down the coast at the Barcelo Maya Caribe. Playacar is a gated community with resort, after resort, after resort piled on top of each other. The beach was gorgeous as expected, but the resort was a bit of a disappointment. I emailed prior to arriving with a room request which was not acknowledged in any way. At check-in I once again requested a certain block and was given a room very far from my request with a comment that I would love it(I did not). After traveling all day we just accepted the room in Block 9. The room itself was clean so we unpacked,put on our swimsuits and went to explore. The pool area was extremely crowded with not a lounger available. The towel game is something you need to catch on to quickly if you intend to spend anytime at all near the pools! So many empty chairs with towels on them - it was ridiculous! We learned if you wanted to be anywhere near a pool you had to save one by 6:00 in the morning. I hated to play the game but there really wasn't a choice. At the beach it was much easier to find a lounger but also much farther from washroom facilities and the bars. It was quite windy while we were there and the beach not as enjoyable because of it. Meals at the resort buffet were also very busy with people jostling for food as if they were starving to death. The tables at the buffet are banquet style so not a lot of elbow room. Servers were scare at times which was common throughout the resort. I found them to be very understaffed at the buffet as well as at the bars. The food was acceptable but far from tasty. We never ate at a restaurant on the resort because the line was always so long to book - the last thing I want to do on my vacation is stand in line! Our maid service was also very sporadic - some days the room would be cleaned by noon but other days we would be out till 5 and come back to our room as we left it. The furniture on the patio was pathetic, as was our view - we looked out upon staff quarters. The lobby area also had very old and uncomfortable furnishings.

The guests are low in class, there was hardly one view in my eyesight where there was a guest without a tattoo, most of them had tattoos and piercings all over them, they're big and in their 40s/50s/60s - you make up your own mind what kind of people they are, you either fit in with that or don't - I think it was an eyesore. No way is it 5 star - what are Riu thinking of - more like 3 on a good day. you decide if cracked tiles, squashed mozzies on the walls, bad paint jobs, chipped sinks, black between tiles in shower, loose taps, doors not closing on the toilet, rusty metal in room, tv all fuzzy, squeeky bed springs with a crackling cheap mattress protector, light switches hanging off walls and accommodation with a view butted up against another block and crammed in like sardines, with cheap plastic chairs and tables in the restaurant is 5 star - surely not. Couldn't get a wink of sleep because no matter which room you stayed it was noisy, the open air theatre is very noisy so if you are closer to the pool and beach then forget an early night and the people slam the doors and make alot of noise (singing, arguing, banging on doors) shouting when going past your room - there is no escape 24/7 because of the echoing layout. Couldn't get a sunbed by the pool unless you went at 5am to reserve one and in the restaurant I've never known anything like it - talk about greedy and pushing in, have people totally lost their table manners altogether and forgot how respectful it is to queue up like the rest of us. Restaurant layout is crowded and sometimes people had to share tables with strangers. perhaps this kind of resort attracts this type of guest, could have been great if you removed the selfish noisy greedy people that made me passively smoke non stop - then I could have had a nice relaxing holiday without getting lung cancer during the process. watersports guys on the beach try every tactic to prevent you from booking kayaks and sailing - don't know what their problem was. Cancun airport was the worst i've ever been to - expect chaos and 3 hours to get baggage and through a 300 person queue through immigration desks - terrible, never again. visited Coba, Xel-Ha and Xplore - they were all equally amazing and worth every penny. take Pesos with you (not US Dollars), they round down the exchange range from 1.2 to 1.0 on dollars, but the Pesos are face value.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, Great location!\u201d", "Author": "Leanne F", "ReviewID": "UR125707975", "Content": "Cancun airport was a bit of a shambles, took forever to get bags and filling out loads of forms but thats another story!!

The hotel is lovely set in beautiful gardens that are looked after really well daily, the different wildlife including the monkey are fascinating to watch from your balcony or just while wandering about. The room was really nice (2223), plently big enough for the 2 of us but smelt a bit foisty which we put down to it been quite humid. We left all our stuff in our cases as we didn't want them going damp and smelly, the bedding even felt damp although it was clean. Could have done with a kettle in the room but the fridge and mini bar was filled every other day and there was plenty of pop and water. Apart from that the rooms have everything you need, tv, hairdryer, iron, ironing board and are cleaned daily. We read alot of reviews on here before we went about the food but went with an open mind. There is so much choice but me and my partner wasn't too keen on the taste of quite a bit of the food and the food wasn't very well labelled up and the bread was left out uncovered so it went stale very quick. Didn't know if it was just the way mexicans tried to cook English food or what but when we went to Xel Ha for the day I had a great beef stew and the food there was really good. All in all we had a great holiday and it was our first time in Mexico, the beach, pool area, entertainment and staff are spot on and its only a 5 minute taxi ride to 5th Avenue which I highly recommend to visit on a night or throught the day.

From the arrival to our departure we were treated very well. Our room was a little bit on the tired side, and could have done with a spruce up, but generally it was fine. It had everything you would need, with iron and ironing board, hair drier, free optics and well stocked fridge, to and airer on the balcony to dry you clothes. The whole hotel was very very clean, with an army of cleaners working hard all day. There are groundsmen keeping the beautiful grounds tidy and manicured, and the magnificent white sandy beach was cleaned every moring of any seaweed washed up. The bar staff and restaurant waiters are all really friendly, and work at an incredible pace. We were fortunate to bump into Joseph, the Assistant Hotel Manager, on a few occassions. He seemed to be there every day, always asking the visiters how they were and asking about their stay. He wasn't sitting behind his desk very much, but checking on anything and everything. The entertainment in the hotel is excellent to, something for everyone. There activities going on during the day in the pool or on the beach, from streching and excercising, to beach football and volleyball. There are different shows in the open air theatre every night, which also are excellent and fun. The food in the restaurants is excellent too, with different themes throughout the week, and plenty of choice. There are three specialisr restaurants on site, which you have to book for, so you need to get to breakfast quite early as that is when the bookings are taken. I can recommend the Steakhouse, and the Shanghai Restaurants. The beach is shared with the Tequila Hotel too, so there can be a scramble for the sunbeds on the beach in the morning. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the PlayaCar Shopping Plaza, with a Starbucks for those missing a decent coffee, and its about a 35 minute walk to Playa Del Carmen and 5th Ave, the main street with shops bars and restaurants etc. Coco Bongo is a must visit. it's and entertainment night club, but it is truly amazing.

We had our kids with us ages 19, 21, 22, 23. We landed in Cancun Airport at 2:15 on a Saturday afternoon and arrived at the resort at 7:00...BRUTAL.....took 3 hours just to get through immigration due to all the planes landing at the same time and only 6-8 officers working and not too speedily. It was a GONG show.Once we finally hooked up with our Sunwing rep, we were whisked off to our shuttle van. We only had 1 other family in our van so made 1 stop at Moon Palace and took approx 1 hour to get to the Yucatan. Our travelling companions had arrived the day before, so they greeted us in the lobby and the check in went smooth. Room We stayed in block 5. (we asked for block 4 in an email approx 1 week prior but were not accomodated) but we were very happy with 5. It is 1 minute walk to the lobby and 3 minutes to the pools. Our patio faced the main walkway through the jungle so every morning we heard the monkeys in the trees and people taking pictures - not too early though. As mentioned by many, the rooms are slightly dated but clean. A king sized bed is actually 2 doubles pushed together and YES the are firm. Ask for a topper. They will either give you foam if they have any left or they put blankets underneath the pad. The rooms have a mini fridge stocked every other day and 4 liquor dispensors. The beer is Dos EQUIS bottles. Never an issue with water, beer or soda. A nice tip and note and you will be stocked for the week. The only thing negative about the rooms is that they actually give you a key with a big key holder and room number printed on the key... not exactly convenient to carry around OR for security purposes. Also, the locks in the room are a keyed padlock... another key to lug around and potentially lose. Very old school Beach Probably the best part of this resort is the beach. Beautiful white sand and very large. Wide and deep. You actually walk down stairs to get to the beach and there are an abundant amount of loungers. Never had an issue getting 8 loungers for our group. The water is warm and sandy. No need for water shoes as we didn't encounter any rocks in the water and we spent everyday in the ocean. Some days the surf was rough with big waves (our fav time to play) and other days the surf was calmer with small waves. You can walk in either direction forever. If you head north, you can actually make it to Playa del Carmen in approx 30 mins. There is NO drink service on the beach. You need to walk up to the pool bars and get your own. There is staff on the beach but they primarily are just picking up the cups. You will also get approached by TOUR operators selling you excursion trips. Although they have RIU logo on their clothing they are not employed by the RIU. Apparently they pay for the space to sell their trips and yes you can negotiate pricing. OUr Sunwing rep told us they have had issues with security on some of the trips these guys sell, so I would recommend staying away from using them. Maybe for jet skiing or parasailing. POOLS There are 2 pools and both are located close to the beach. They both have swim up bool bars. The one pool is classified as the activity pool and a bit noisier and more action. The staff at the pool bars are very good at getting the drinks out quick and work very hard. Yes, if you tip them early, they will remember you and get your drinks quicker. Tipping is not necessary but it made us feel good to take care of a few of them that were so nice to us all week. The pools are not huge compared to other resorts we have stayed at but are adequate and the water is warm. Food. We only stayed for 4 days as the resort offered FREE upgrades to the Palace Riviera Maya (reviewed seperately). We ate BUFFET for dinner 3x and tried the Japanese ala carte. The breakfast buffets are typical. Egg station, pastries, fruit, cereal, etc..... Theree is enough here to satidsfy anyone. Not upscale but average. We ate lunches primarily at the Margarita restaurant near the beach and pools. Typical lunch grub, hamburgers, dogs, pizza, fresh fish, salads, nachos, guacamole (which was good btw). They have self serve beer, wine, water and soft drinks. Wine is NOT good either. Again food was good not great but typical for buffet. The only thing I did not like about this restaurant is that 1. Self seating 2. You can walk in barefoot and with no shirt. Not my preference for a restaurant. Dinner buffets changed daily with certain themes and again food was average but ok..... There is always something to find that you will like. The Japanese restaurant is buffet style. You are served though and the food and service was very good. We are used to the style where they prepare the food on the grill for you but still was a fun night. Service We found the service was very good at the Yucatan. The bartenders work very hard and are very friendly. Our adult children befriended many of them and had lots of fun. There are people cleaning the resort all day long. Sevice in the buffets are also attentive to taking away dirty dishes etc.... Nightlife/Enetertainment After dinner they have an outdoor theatre for nightly shows. The theatre is right near block 4. So if you hit the sheets early, these are not the rooms for you. The shows are done around 11:00 and there are 2 large sqaure bars almost side by side serving drinks. Again, the drinks and service were very good and friendly. The shows themselves are typical resort quality entertainers. Our kids walked over to the Tequila resort a few nights to go to the only disco and said it was OK... Nothing too special. They prefered the disco at the Iberostar Lindo last year. Once the shows are over, the resort nightlife pretty much is over. A few will venture to the lobby bar area which is open until 7:00am. They have an entertainment team that works throughout the day. They are ok and leave you alone for the most part. I find the Iberostar, Barcelo and Bahia Principe resorts do a better job getting you involved in pool and beach games and have much more activities to offer if this is important to you. As mentioned, they were handing out sheets for a FREE upgrade to the Palace Riviera Maya just down the road, so after 4 days we packed up and took advantage of this for our last 3 days. I have reviewed this seperately. But I will quickly say that for the extra money that you would have to pay for the Palace, I don't think it is really worth it. We talked as a group and all decided that we liked the VIBE and layout better at the Yucatan. Trips Did 2 off resort activities. Coco Bongos in Playa del Carmen. Highly recommended but a late night. We also did a Snorkeling with Sea Turtles/stingrays, zip lining, rapelling, under water cave excursion that was also fun. These are reviewed seperately. All were booked with our Sunwing rep. General Bring drink mugs for the pool bars and beach - Bubba Kegs work well Internet was free in lobby area, but slow at times No issues with mosquitos or bugs Tipping maids will get you more beer. Tipping bartenders will get you quicker drinks There is a Starbucks within 5 min walk off the resort in a shopping complex We have stayed at the Iberostar Lindo, Barcelo Maya Beach Resort, Bahia Principe Tulum prior to this trip and our fav was the Iberostar. I would rate the RIU probably 4th. We still had a great trip and experience at the RIU but the others were just slightly nicer. The beach was the best part of our RIU trip.

As a foreplay to an unpleasantly long and not comfortable flight, it was an ugly turn - more so for those, who came with connecting flights, and already waited hours in their airport of departure, then in the Flughafen Frankfurt. Then came the long, boring, 12 hours flight, its discomfort aggravated by the fact that unlike the sardines in a tin, we felt sorely what a narrow space is provided for a passenger. The lack of somewhat normal legroom made the long flight really wearying. The oh how very right honorable European Union nowadays enforces most strict rules so as to protect the rights of the egg producing hens to the comfort. Certainly, they ought to likewise enforce the rights of the people cased in for a long flight to some minimum of comfort. At the Cancun Airport pick-up by TUI's local people was smooth, well-organized. (Also in the hotel, TUI\u2019s representative provided us perfect service.) Nevertheless, because of Condor we lost a great experience: to start our stay at Riu Yucatan with dinner in its main and very impressive restaurant \"La Hacienda\". The delay caused us to arrive in the hotel too late, with all its restaurants already closed by 10 p.m. This was an ugly surprise, since in former times the Riu Hotels boasted with an all day round, i.e. 24 hours a day catering service to its all-inclusive guests. Later we experienced that the niveau of the services and facilities provided to the guests shrinked somewhat, in some aspects, as compared to former experiences. Exactly as if the oh so right honorable IMF's mantra of restrictions, restrictions, cut-downs were in force here as well. Most probably, the number of workforce has been reduced, lessening, as a consequence, the comfort provided to the guests. Workforce - definitely the best and really excellent feature of Riu Hotel Yucatan. When we had something to arrange, contacted a member of the management, and he was absolutely willing to help us. Everyone in the team of the reception desk was friendly and quick to serve us - with Riu's slogan here, they are \"excelente\", and really! If there was any problem, they were quick to have it eliminated. Most polite and friendly were the waiters and waitresses in the restaurants, as well as the cooks who prepare some dishes in situ at the handout tables in the Hacienda and refills the trays, and also the files and ranks who clean the rooms, make repairs, work in the parks, poolside etc. As to the latter, it helps, of course, if one speaks Spanish to them. The waiters and waitresses are reasonably polyglots, but they also reciprocate with additional kindness if the guest speaks to them Spanish. A colorful feature of the place is that large part of them is Maya - exceptionally nice people. One sees profiles among them which are like those on the ancient reliefs in the British Museum, but these ones smile at you quite often. Choosing room better stay far away from the theatre - otherwise your evenings will be full of the most aggressive noise that is used for music and entertainment. Rooms near to the reception house are nice quiet. The all-inclusive catering is reasonably good. Quantity of food unlimited, quality mostly medium, choice not so good, changes of choice almost nil. Fish and poultry are usually well-prepared. However, for beef don't leave home your battle axe, and sometimes you may need it for squids, too! Choice of fruits were extremely small. Main restaurant: the walking route between the rows of self-service and hand-out tables with food is rather narrow, therefore often crowded, overcrowded. Apart from this, the place is well-ordered, nicely furnished, clean, reasonably comfortable. No standing in queue for tables, one always finds free ones. Drinks are provided in the rooms, both soft and hard, in ample quantity. Drinks in the bars plentiful, but during daytime the effect of shrinking the service is harsh: out of the four poolside bars often two, sometimes three were closed, the open ones therefore crowded. Bartenders do their best, but in a four-sided bar there is often only one or two of them, and so it is often hard for them to cope with the task, and one needs some stamina so as to obtain what he or she wants. Soft drinks. One also can get soft drinks at the self-service taps. However, these were a lottery: the drinks are certainly made of diluted concentrates, and dilution was quite often grossly exaggerated, resulting in a low quality liquid. You never know beforehand what quality you draw from the tap. The room. Ours was the basic, so called standard one. Beds are quite good, comfortable. Facilities to store our things sufficient. There is a small, too small table with two small, too small armchairs, more a token of comfort than real means of it. All in all, the room is suitable mainly for activities that can be carried out on the bed. If you want to watch the TV, also lie on the bed. And there is the usual idiot design of lighting: only dim lamps and no place in the room where one have proper light. If you want to read, either strain the eyes, or go to the bathroom, there is suitable light. And don't bring along books with small letters! As to the TV, it is practically almost useless: no list of available channels, and if one maps them step by step, no teletext to show their program timetables. Bathroom: there is not a seat or something to sit on. If you like nice strong shower, here you wouldn't get it, only a weak one. In the shower slot there is no light at all. Only upon having got out you will see whether succeeded to wash down all the sticky suntan lotion. And again the idiot design: the shower-slot has a very high and wide threshold, rather difficult to cross for those who are not so fit. Safety rail or something to grasp on near the threshold not provided. More to it, the floor of the shower basin when wet is slippery like hell. Upon quite a long insistence they provided the special mat to put in the shower basin. More of idiot design: in the shower slot there is no shelf or other facility where one could place a bottle of shampoo, or even the small envelopes of shower gel provided really in good quantity by the hotel. Toilet: no ventilation, and you can feel it! However unusual, no emergency ring or phone in the bathroom. If you have an accident, and can't get to the phone in the room, you are in for it. Hygiene is a bit strange, like in many hotels: the same person makes the room, cleans everything including the toilet, makes the beds and shakes up the pillows, apparently without gloves to be changed between the phases or washing hands in between. On the other hand, the whole place is meticulously kept always clean, well-ordered, nice looking. The park is literally beautiful. In this aspect no compromise can be felt. A strange feature is that in the toilet at the pool systematically a woman cleans the men's room, freely entering all the time. Beach: large, nice, sandy, palm trees, with chaise lounges that are reasonably comfortable, except their new generation, which is not really. Pool country. Here one feels even more harshly than on the beach that the total number of places per total number of rooms ratio is most probably not very favorable for the guests. Places for sun-beds where one can enjoy the sun are rather crowded and strongly sought after, creating a silent standing fight. Palm trees provide beautiful sight, but block lot of the sunshine, likewise the buildings in the afternoon, all of them reducing the sunny places. There is no place where one can take the sun all day round - true, there are plenty of such places on the beach if one doesn't mind the sand and often the wind. Sun worshippers go down to take a well-situated chaise lounge around 6 a.m. or even earlier. However, by the afternoon they ought to move to get sun, but mostly no free place with sunshine. Often by around 10 a.m. no free chaise lounge at all either in pool country or in the beach. The management states that reserving chaise lounges and places is not allowed, but obviously nobody believes that other ones would abide, therefore none does. Most unpleasantly for the majority, smoking is allowed throughout the pool country, also in the lobby and the open-air theatre, and there are always ugly souls who make their surroundings stink and irritate other people. Guests are of mixed qualities of behaviors. By all appearances, this is not exactly the meeting place of the high society, or even the well-to-do (to put it very mildly). Majority of them are reasonably civilized, but there are the other ones, who are often rather annoying. The crowdedness makes more unpleasant to endure the latters, and those who do not mind a bit the discomfort they cause to other ones. For them, the name of the game is cheeky people get the upper hand. They consider their natural privilege to put their chaise lounge right before yours, blocking view and sunshine, and to behave quite annoyingly. Very pleasant feature of the hotel that in the park around the buildings there are nice little animals: cat-sized rodents moving to and fro daytime. Sometimes even apes or monkeys can be seen, little black birds make the place more lively, and a most interesting dveller is an iguana, mostly stone-quiet, but always on guard. In the \"theatre\" there are entertainment programs almost every evening. As to their quality, de gustibus... The \"main course\" starts around 9.45 p.m., but if you want a table wherefrom can really see the stage, better take it around 8.30. - and guard it! All in all, on the value/price scale the place is reasonably good in its category. Homebound, the TUI representatives, charming ladies, taking us to the airport were absolutely kind and helpful, rendering the check-in smooth and free of any problem. Epilogue: the muy amables Mexican authorities do not care a bit about the visitors\u2019s well-being: check-in time at Cancun Airport is unendurable, unreasonable three hours! This is the penalty for visiting Mexico, as no other earthly reason can sustain such a long waiting. Nice adi\u00f3s from Mexico. True, when we arrived, exactly half of the passport control booths were unmanned, rendering the cue horribly long and slow, as a bienvenido in Mexico! And BEWARE TUI!!

Myself and my girlfriend Zoe stayed at the Hotel RIU Yucatan in Playacar, the view accross the beach and the crystal clear blue caribbean sea was breathtaking, the neighbouring resort centre of Player del Carman was excellent with plenty of shops, restaurants and bars especially on fifth avenue which is roughly three miles long. The biggest part of our holiday we must say was our hotel, the hotel RIU Yucatan was a large hotel set out in small blocks in lovely gardens with palm trees and flowers. The hotel has two large swimming pools both with swim up bars and jacuzzi's, the RIU Yucatan has numerous bars and the drinks are unbelievably all inclusive, the all unclusive bar not only covers soft drinks, beer and wine but also cocktails, top shelf branded spirits and there is even a mini bar and four optic bottles hanging up in a cabinet in the hotel room. There is a main restaurant where the buffet s nearly the length of a football pitch and the food was to a very high standard with a fabulous choice and there is also three themed restaurants which is also part of the all inclusive package which was Mexican, Asian and a Steak House which were also very good. The most wonderful element regarding the hotel is the staff that work there from the reception staff, the waiters, the bar staff and the chef's to the groundsmen and the cleaners who are so welcoming and friendly and always have a smile on thier face and always have a 'no problem' and 'your welcome' kind of attitude. Credit must be given to the management that run the RIU Yucatan, they have recruited a great team of staff and by the way the staff go about thier works it's obvious that the staff are happy in thier work, they are paid a fair wage and none of the staff seem to be overworked or any department seem to be understaffed and they all say they enjoy thier work and it shows, so in short, a wonderfully run hotel, with a great atmosphere, great service, great food & drink, lovely staff in a fabulous location which i can thoroughly reccomend the RIU Yucatan to family, friend or stranger.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat beach location - great staff/service\u201d", "Author": "MS58", "ReviewID": "UR125557860", "Content": "Visit 11th. Feb. to 25th Feb. 2012 First trip to Mexico, after a 10.5 hour flight Cancun airport was not a great start - it took another 1.5 hours to clear passport control, search for our cases which had been removed from the carousel (normal practice from what we were told later) and then the worse queue of all when passengers from probably 3 flights jostled for position to funnel into one queue to clear customs by having all bags passed through a scanner before being asked to push a button which thankfully turned green and we were allowed to exit the terminal. By contrast departure was quick and extremely well organised ! However once that was over we boarded our coach and received the most genuine welcome to Mexico and our holiday started. About 50 minutes drive we were dropped at the RIU Yucatan again the best welcome, our room keys and safe deposit keys laid out on a desk, porters at the ready to take our luggage to the rooms and we were personally shown to our room block - the quickest and best check-in we have ever experienced - brilliant! This is a well established hotel with well established and very well maintained grounds full of the local wildlife. Given this information is probably the reason that some reviews are not complimentary of the rooms. To some the rooms may appear \"old fashioned\" because the furniture is a dark wood as are the doors and there is a rather large t.v in the room. As far as we are concerned the rooms and are fine, spacious, plenty of storage and hanging space and most importantly of all clean. If you want modern rooms with flat screen t.v.s go to a newer hotel if you want a more traditional hotel with staff who make you feel really welcome and provide the best service you could wish for go to the Yucatan. There was a large choice of food in the main restaurant - breakfast, lunch or dinner- lots of food cooked at the service counters so plenty of hot food unlike hotels we have used in the Canaries where all inclusive buffet meals are generally \"warm\" at best. Could not fault the food or the service. Dress is informal even at dinner the only stipulation for men was that they did not wear vest tops, shorts and \"cut - offs \" were fine. All Inclusive means just that at the Yucatan, no hidden charges for towels, safe keys or drinks in the room there are 4 optics and a fridge topped up every couple of days with soft drinks, beer and water. Almost forgot to mention the \"cute\" towel sculptures that are left in the rooms and the hard working ents. team. Bar staff were brilliant also (branded drinks used too - Gordon's, Beefeater, Smirnoff) . I could go on but to conclude we would definately return to this hotel - clean, great service, great location and great staff and management - other bits- this time of year is busy with Canadians and Americans - they do get up early and bag the sunbeds by the pool , I'm talking 6 a.m early. Loads of sunbeds on the beach though. I was a little dismayed at the amount of litter irresponsible people left on the beach. It is almost impossible not to step on cigarette butts and there was numerous pieces of plastic litter about - plastic bottle lids, cups, plastic bags in the sea - come on people take your rubbish with you let us all enjoy and protect our environment ! Playa del Carmen was a 40 minute stroll away, 5th. Avenue never appears to end, lots of shops, bars and restaurants a place you must visit - taxis from Playacar only 90 pesos. A visit to Xel-Ha is a must. We enjoyed Tulum and Coba although I felt slightly guilty climbing to the top of the temple, the stones in places are becoming extremely shiny from wear and surely the Mexican government will take steps soon to better preserve this impressive piece of their heritage.

Theres so much wildlife at the hotel its truly amazing to see, Monkeys came to the balcony most days and the iguanas freely roam around, they also have another animal that looks like a rabbitt but larger with no ears .. Towells and bedding are changed daily as is your pool and beach towels so no need to accumulate more luggage weight by taking your own. The food was amazing and as with all AI resturuants the food can get a little tiresom but the options here was truly wonderful, something for everyone and the deserts were to die for (try the chocolate cheesecakes mmmmmm) we tried all the restuarants and liked them all. You get so many dishes dont eat before you go.. Entertainment is good, as with all hotel reviews people always want more but we found that the evening entertainment was good, nice way to meet fellow holiday makers and have a drink. Theres daytime entertainment also and just goes to show how hard these guys really work. My son done his PADI diving examinations on this holiday and the staff at the diving school on site are fantastic, He is 14 and for 9 days he was on this course, he saw some amazing things diving and spent four hours in the morning out on his Dive, back for lunch then the afternoon was 2 hours theory, He passed at the end of the course and has not only gained a PADI DIVING CERTIFICATE . is also qualified to dive in open seas it also is 20 points of his P.E G.C.S.E exam . Well worth it and truly and expierence of a lifetime. We done a few trips whilst in Mexico .. Chichiniza was a fantastic day out , learnt some Mexician history, and went swimming in the senata .Was very beautiful. COCO BONGOS - is a must have never ever expierence a night like it .. amazing ... i wont tell you to much as wont want it to spoil your fun but if you get the chance to go YOU MUST. New years eve was a truly amazing night and had plenty of celebrations, they gave out so much party stuff and the meal and celebrations was one I will never forget .. Without going on to much this really is a lovely place to spend your holidays, Lovely People - Fantastic service - clean - good food - lovely part of mexico - loads to do and see - beautiful beaches - great place for making Holiday Memories!!!", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wakefield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cToo busy for us\u201d", "Author": "SemiRetiredCarol", "ReviewID": "UR125491791", "Content": "Have just returned from Holiday at the Riu Yucatan. This is the largest hotel in the Riu group in Playacar area and we chose it because of the beach. On reflection we would have chosen the Riu Playacar or the Club hotel as it was very busy. We ate at all 3 of the speciality restaurants and loved the Steak House, you do have to be up early to book these, but it was no problem for us.The food in the main restaurant was also very good with a wide choice and the Pasta dishes were cooked as you waited. One great plus point for booking a Riu in this area is that you are free to use the other hotels for lunch and also their facilities.The rooms are spacious and although a slight musty smell when we first arrived this dissapeared when the air con came on and we never detected it again. I requested a quiet room and was happy with the location my only problem with the room was the plastic sheets on the bed which rustled every time I turned over and made me feel very hot. The Hotel does not reach my expectations of a 5 star, I would rate at 3.5 - 4. For 5 star stay at a Riu Palace, we did last time we went to Mexico and it was much better. The beach is lovely if a bit crowded, if you turn left out of the hotel you can walk to Playa It is very safe to walk about and about a 20 - 30 minute walk will take you into Playa del Carmen where you can wander along 5th Avenue and it's shops, laze on the town beach or get the ferry across to Cozumel where the snorkelling is brilliant. I you take a right turn you can walk right up to the end of the beack where it is much quieter, but there are no facilities to get a drink.", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cReturned from the Riu Yucatan yesterday\u201d", "Author": "brits", "ReviewID": "UR125471479", "Content": "We spent two weeks at this hotel. We flew with First Choice/Thompsons with premium seats - so glad we did as we did not know at this point the nightmare of disembarking at Cancun. A lovely breeze greeted us as we went down the steps onto the tarmac which was welcome in the heat - downhill after that - we entered the terminal and, were as the middle queue as two other independant queues merged with us from two flights of stairs. We were like ants looking for a way to move forward into the barriers leading up to the immigration booths. How no one fainted I do not know ! It took us just over TWO hours to get from the plane to the tour bus and, we also had to have our luggage x rayed again. There is a red button at this point and, you press it, if it lights up green, hurrah - you can go to the bus but, if it is red you have to make your way over to the immigration officer so that he may search your suitcase. Once on the bus we had almost anothe HOUR of waiting for 4 other passengers - finally the Rep said we would go as we had all waited long enough. Perhaps the missing 4 had been waylaid by the immigration or perhaps they had made their own way to their hotels. We were told that the reason for all the chaos was due to 3 planes arriving at once - talking to other holidaymakers who arrived after or prior to us, this is the explanation all the time and, we were lucky as one man told us his time from plane to bus was a lot longer ! We arrived at the Yucatan and, we welcomed with a cold drink and, a rapid check in was very welcome. Room 3305 - was our allotcation and, we were happy with this top floor room. Room just as described by others - minus a musty smell/mould in the shower - roomy and, very clean. An overhead fan aswell as air conditioning. The room was cleaned everyday and, the mini bar restocked. Main restaurant food - more than adequate, really do not know why some people complain about it, plenty of variety and, the bonus of fresh smoothies made there and, then. Only gripe there was seeing a few men pick a slice of melon/pineapple, pop it in their mouths then think it is OK to use the same fingers to get more of the same - no manners! Try the cappachino out of the drink dispenser, I for one really enjoyed this with a choc muffin. We did not visit The Steak house due to other guests telling us that the steaks were huge (not our thing). The Mexican was a HUGE letdown - The Asian was the best in our opinion but, the queue at 7 am is so long to book - we used to go and, start our breakfast and, as the queue went down, joined it and, we were still able to dine at one or other of our choice. Pool area - can get a little cramped and, amazingly some people are willing to get up at 5 30 am to lay claim to their little bit of sunbed heaven with their towels!!! We went for breakfast at the Riu Tequila one morning and, their protocol for this reserving lark is to remove the towels and, personal effects onto a nearby table with a printout stating that it is not the done thing - take note Riu Yucatan for the future, please. Pool bars - can get loud but, heyyyy it is holiday time and, each to their own. Two swim up bars and, poolside entertainment. Cleaners are ever present, as are the gardners and, it shows. There is a booth near to the beach and, when this opens there is a book swap. Monkey - one was in the bower of trees leading from the main dining hall to the pool - if tempted he/she will come down and, take food from you or try to prise open your clenched palm - so cute but, please remember the risk of rabies! Mozzies - we got a few bites but, on our last day sat near the reception in the afternoon as we waited for our bus to the airport. Cockroaches - we did not see any at all - my pet hate too! Beach - it is lovely and, yes you can walk in either direction but, there is a dip from the main sand to the waters edge - hence the walking \"path\" is fairly narrow and, one line going one way and, vice versa at certain times of the day - a lot of seaweed while we were there but, out of human control - it was swept and, raked up and, then buried in large holes dug by the gardners - phewww! All of the pool restrooms etc were always clean and, tidy. We went to Playa Del Carmen one evening - busy - ATMs only dispense $. The only tour we did was X Caret (sp)- we enjoyed a change of scenery and, all that was on offer there. The Mexicanna Buffet included in the ticket price was AMAZING, we were in there for almost 2 hours - the horse arena was right next door and, we sat and, watched the girls on horseback going through their routine. We had a gin n tonic that was in a glass that was about a pint size ! If you decide to go to visit take a few toiletries from the hotel for a shower and, a plastic bag to contain your wet swimsuit/towel - the towel and, snorkel are in the plus package price. The dolphins with their young were a delight and, there is a viewing area to just sit and, watch them swim. After two weeks it was time to pack up and, leave the Yucatan - Jose arrived to escort us - he explained in great detail to us the routine for the departure tax and, check in - so much so that he did say he likes the sound of his own voice! Once in line to check in, half way down are two girls with a wad of money and, a stamp - you give them your choice of \u00a3 $ or peso and, change is given. Going through security was a breeze - a pleasant suprise after the agony on arrival. Plenty of shops and, eaterries in departure and, gate areas. We enjoyed our stay at the Yucatan - I spent two days/nights in pur room but, I hasten to add, MY OWN EXCESSES, nothing to do with the hotel food etc The Hotel is not a 5 star at all but, if you go knowing this then you wont be disapointed. The only thing that deters us from making a return trip is the airport chaos, the departure tax and, the manic reserving of the sunbeds. Would I recommend this hotel to anyone - yes - but, think that small children would prefer to be elsewhere. There is a bridge over a part of the pool - be careful as it is slippery at times. There are other wooden bridges - be careful as some of the wood stands proud and, is waiting for someone to stub their toe before a fall.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cSurprise, Surprise!!\u201d", "Author": "TennesseeBeachbound", "ReviewID": "UR125459782", "Content": "Just got back last night from the Riu Yucatan. Very nice resort. Have visited Playa del Carmen for the past 11 years, can't beat that area. The resort was larger than we typically like but we were surprising some friends, they booked that resort and wanted us to go with them, we declined because our first grandchild is due on March 12. The hubby and I discussed it and decided can't pass this up,so we showed up unannounced for shock value!! What a hit that was...we walked up behind them in the buffet area after they arrived at the resort, it was priceless! Okay, enough of that...about the resort: Food, very good, steak house was our favorite, then the Asian. Drinks, generous (Victoria at the pool bar makes them great!) OH, AND TIP HER, SHE'S EXPECTING A LITTLE BAMBINO. Rooms were very very clean and spacious. The entertainment was highly motivated (even tho we were not). They do a great job getting people involved in all types of activities. I only have great things to say about our stay at this resort. On a negative note (regarding the guests at the resort, not the resorts fault): If you can not afford suntan lotion during your stay at this resort, perhaps you should not go! I sure hope the people/person that took our two bottles needed it more than we did! So glad that happened on our last day at the resort, otherwise we'd have had to purchase more. But again, if you have to \"steal\" something that does not belong to you, maybe you should just stay home till you save enough money to purchase your own lotion to take with you. YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE...this place is to classy to have to worry about theft! WATCH YOUR STUFF and don't leave anything at your lounge chair that you don't want \"taken\" by someone else. We were at the pool area, then walked to the beach, leaving our towel and lotion on our chair only to come back and have our lotion gone.

Very clean, good food, gorgeous beach but small rooms really not suitable for a family of four. Two tiny doubles and a curtain to close off the bathroom. not enough room in the bed for myself and my husband to sleep comfortably (and we are a family of small body proportions). Had to request a put up bed for my older daughter, so I could share with my youngest and hubby had one bed to himself. The food is good and there is plenty of choice. One niggle though was the lack of any kind of sparkling wine. We celebrated our anniversary while on holiday and couldn't toast with a glass of bubbly! Surely a 'five star' hotel should have champagne available, even if its at charge? The entertainment is very poor unless you enjoy 'anyone from' for at least half an hour every night. Followed by musical chairs. Then sitting through the same dance routines but to different music. The entertainment team work very hard all day then are expected to perform at night. The show often didn't start until 10pm. Not good for children with jetlag. Perhaps two shows a night would be better. The kids club was a bit hit and miss. Once I happened on my daughter in the kids club just sat in the theatre watching the kids club supervisor rehearsing for the night show. At least she'd been given some felt-tips to colour in with I suppose. The beach is gorgeous with plenty of sunbeds for all. Beautiful clear sea unfortunately this changed in our last few days as a storm brought in tonnes of seaweed that washed up all along the shore and floated in big drifts on the sea. Staff were out every morning digging deep holes to bury the stuff. Spoilt swimming in the sea a bit, but obviously I don't blame the hotel for the weather! Lovely walk up the beach to the town for shopping, takes about 30 mins strolling through the surf. If you are budgeting be warned that there is a $62 dollar airport tax for every person in your party that has to be paid in cash (pounds, dollars or pesos) when you depart the airport. If you do decide to book the Yucatan take a walk to the Riu Palace next door to see what a real 5* looks like, you can't use your all inclusive band for any food or drink here unlike the 'Riu Tequila' across the road (also claiming to be 5*).

Weather was a big conern because the forcast was very bad, it called for straight rain for about 3 of the days. We flew down with Sunwing which was also fine until we meet the rep at the resort. The sunwing rep we found to be rude and pushy and did not seemed concerned with his customers. We pushed us to take a the 4X4 Adventure excurtion which I would not recommend. The only good part was the cave swim but it was very cold and when we left the swim we all had hypothermia. The resort was very nice and the staff where all great. The wild life at the resort was very interesting, we really enjoyed the jungle atmosphere. Pools are beautiful but the beach was amazing! We really did not like the rooms as they where dark, very dated and had a funny smell to them which took about 3 times in the washing machine to get the smell out of our clothing!! The other problem with the rooms are that when a door closes in your block it makes a loud bang! It happens alot through the night when party people come and go from there rooms, this really affected our sleep. The rooms are for sleeping anyway but it would have been good to have a good nights sleep! The food we thought was good/average with lots of selection.

We went there the first week of Feb and loved every minute of it. I would say that of all the all-inclusives that I have stayed at, this was the top 3. Let me address some of the concerns that people had.. BEDS Neither my husband my son or myself had an issue with the beds. They are firm but not HARD. Sleeping on a soft bed is bad for people with bad backs like myself and I found that I didn\u2019t have back issues at all the whole week I slept there. ROOMS AND ROOM NOISE We didn\u2019t hear our neighbors the whole time we were there. We were wondering if we even had any neighbors until we saw them walk out of their room. We were in Building 4000 and I suggest if you want a quiet building close to the pool but not RIGHT AT the pool, you request the 4000 building. We had room 4207 and it was great with a view of dense jungle and monkeys.. The rooms were extremely clean (and Im picky about clean). I don\u2019t understand the complaints about the rooms being dated either. It is MEXICO. You will not get stainless steel and carpets. The furniture looked new to me and there was NO MOLD! I have a sever mold allergy and trust me, my body can detect mold. I have been to Mexican hotels where we had to call a doctor for me due to a severe allergy. Not here at the Riu though. Did not have any issues with mold. And no matter WHERE you go in Mexico, there is always a musty smell because of the humidity. If you complain about that then you should travel somewhere dry like Arizona. Bathingsuits don\u2019t dry outside very quickly. Air con is super strong but you can turn it down or you will freeze. Food The Buffet was one of the best we ever had. My son was happy about the carved meats. One day it was roast beef. The other it was roast pork. One day they even did Turkey and Gravy. There is always a Mexican food section and they make great made-to-order pastas!!! Did not enjoy the steak restaurant but really liked the Japanese Asian one.! Lots of fish at the buffet. They also always have pizza for the kids, lots of fruit, salads and a great selection of breads. It was great and always new stuff to try. The Mexican restaurant was OK but there is a lot of Mexican food in the Buffet so you don\u2019t need to go there to get good Mexican. My son loved the soft serve ice cream machine at the casual pool restaurant and also the delicious HARD ice cream at the other restaurant. He had at least 3 cones a day! WEAK CHEAP DRINKS??? No way! You have a mouth. You see the premium booze so ASK FOR IT. During the day my pina coladas were just cheap rum by the pool but my husband always asked for Bacardi and Coke and no problemo! They made some nice Martinis. I drank a different one every night! You just have to ask for the premium drinks and they are happy to pour. Mojitos, Banana Mamas, the list goes on\u2026\u2026. There are drinks in your room unlimited but we didn\u2019t even have one. My husband had some beer from our fridge but no hards stuff from the dispenser. STAFF We loved the staff. They all seem to love their jobs. My son is 8 and felt too old for the kids club (he never really liked the kids club in any all inclusive we went to, he likes to hang out with us). My son did all the daily activities like soccer on the beach, water polo, bacci etc with the adults. He followed the schedule closely and was at almost every event. The staff was very nice to him and let him play everything even though often he was the only kid except the rifle shooting (of course) and all knew his name by the end. NIGHT SHOWS I admit these were poor. We liked the pre-show when they brought audience members up to do skits. That was always a good laugh. Otherwise the shows were lacking. GROUNDS Immaculate. The pools were sparkling and everything was perfect. There were little squirrel/guinea pig animals all around and the were afraid of people but they were darned cute. We also saw a monkey and a few Iguanas. I think a room on the second floor is better unless you want an animal visitor although no one had any complaints when we were there about an animal getting in their rooms. POOL CHAIRS I have been to at least 10 all inculsives and there is almost always a chair issue. People get up early and reserve. The problem is that if there are people from different time zones, they are on different schedules so the early bird gets the worm. There are tones of chairs at the beach. SURROUNDING RIU HOTELS: We visited some of the other Rius (they were walking distance) and found ours to be the best one of the 3. Best beach. The Playacar had a nice pool and we stayed a few hours at their pool. Our food was good enough that we didn\u2019t venture to their restaurants even though we could eat there too. We met a couple at the PLAYACAR who said that a person from the Riu Palace came by and said that the Palace is too formal and that he had to wear shorts and shirts for lunch etc. At the Yucatan you can eat the buffet in your bathing suit if you want to (but please, put a wrap on at least). We were not allowed to go to the Palace but after hearing how formal it was, I don\u2019t think I would have wanted to. They Riu Yucatan is chill and relaxed and there are no rules and we had the BEST BEACH EVER!!! Things I didn\u2019t like: Not many, and mostly frivolous. 1. A few things that a lot of 5 stars have that the Riu didn\u2019t were pool service. You had to actually get off your but and get your own drink (or ask your husband to get you one). My husband didn\u2019t t like this but I don\u2019t really like waiters bugging me while I relax either. 2. Also, the shampoo and body soaps came in little packets instead of the nice bottles that you might get at other 5 stars. This was not a HUGE deal except it seemed a little cheap. 3. No room service for meals. 4. Night shows were lame, even for all inclusive standards. Some fun things: On Mexican Night there are games in the lobby where you can win \u201cmoney\u201d and then get prizes. The kids loved this. They also had a pi\u00f1ata for the kids that night as well as a Cotton Candy machine. If you have kids order them a BANANA MAMMA without alcohol. YUM! If you get a calling card, you can use it for free in the little town square about 5 minute walk away. If you use it at the hotel they charge $5 for each attempt to use it (whether you get through or not!!) Tip the maids $2 every once in a while and they will make you nice towel animals. If you only want to do one excursion with kids over the age of 5, the go to the Xel Ha. Expensive but it is the best time you will ever have.! You can snorkel, swim with dolphins, zip line over water, cliff dive, snorkel in a cave\u2026.all for one price. If you want to swim with dolphins go here because you will not be in a small pool, but in a fantastically large protected bay.

From the moment we arrived to the day that we left we had the best time. service from all staff is exceptional and nothing is to much bother. By rection ther is a bar and this is where you can use the wifi for free, you often have people around here with laptops. There is lots of wild here and there are plenty of monkeys, becareful for poo! people feed them bananas, but bananas are not native to mexico so it upsets their stomachs. you are asked and there are signs asking you not to feed them, this is sound advise. We had a second floor room by the pool and althought this is right by the pool and bars sleeping was not a problem as music was never excesive. The rooms are well kept and cleaned every day, the beds are a little hard, ask at reception and they will get you a matress topper. There are even spirits and mixers in your room, filled every other day, again unless you ask for more from reception. The food was amazing, there is different themed nights of food, and if you dont pile evrything on your plate at once there is than enough variety for two weeks. There is evrything from cereals, fruit, fruit juices (fresh) hot food and pancakes and waffles for breakfast. There are 3 al a carte resurants and you need to book these early as they book up quickly. asain, we did not try as we ran out of time, Steak house which was fantastic, and mexican, where i had red snapper and my husband had proper fajitas WOW is all i can say. each night when you go to the buffet resturant they have a drink of the night which is handed to you as you enter. The bars here are excellent and the staff are doing 2 orders at once and asking for the next and never seem to get them wrong, there is no worry about watered down drinks here, 90% of spirits here are premium! so take it easy. The beach here is amazing soft white sands and beautiful blue sea, as with all holidays you get chair hoggers who dont return till late after noon, so get there early. Ihave been told that they have got more chairs now, so alls good. I know you shouldnt do it, but if you sprinkle some bread in the sea and wait you will be surrounded by fish trying to eat from your hands, there are lots of them, but harmless. The enertainment teams here are non stop and very good, they dont hassel either which is ggod, maybe this is because there are so many yankies and canadians willing to go up and play instead. and the evening shows are pretty good, although dont stay here all the time go into 5th avenue. for the sports fans over the road at the Riu playacar there is a sports bar, which my husband loved as he got to watch liverpool will i lounged by the sea. If you want a break from the sun and not go into 5th avenue, there is a starbucks and a few shops 2 minute walk out of the hotel. The hotel it's self is a 40minute walk or a short taxi ride into the main 5th avenue and is well worth a visit, night time is when this place really comes to life. and for all those who cant live with out junk food your in luck, all major resuarants are here. You can even pick up the ferry to cozumel form here but make sure you listen to your reps about the tickets! Whilst here we had to do as everyone who goes to mexico does and went to chitzen itza, well worth the money we had the most amazing day and we went swimming in a cenote ( under ground pool) which was a great experience. We also went to xel-ha, which is a big snorkelling site, and well worth a day here if you love snorkelling. We also went and did a royal swim with dolphines which was the most amazing hour of my life, only four of us !! and two dolphines.

They are amazing how they can be getting one persons order, take your order and someone else's order and not make a mistake. They work long hours and are still very cheerful and friendly! They are very impressive! The nightly entertainment was good. Last years might have been just a little better! The best show was the tribute to Michael Jackson. The entertainment staff are very friendly and outgoing! They have a lot of things to do during the day if you are looking for something to do other than lay on the beach. It would be nice if they had music playing by the pool all day long and after the nightly show. The room staff are very good. If you need anything just ask and they will get it for you if it is available. The rooms have an odor. Some more than others.

This was our 12th stay in 10 years at this resort. Yes, we like it that much! We always ask for a top floor room in block 1, especially the corner room #1325. We were upgraded to an even better location, due mainly to us being repeat customers and the use of our Riu Class card. Rooms in blocks 1, 3, 4, and 6 are acceptable to us, as long as we get on the top floor and the room faces outward. There is much more privacy and quietness in these spots. The hallways are tiled, so carts clack along and foot traffic is a bit noisier on the lower floors. Plus, on the bottom floor, you best keep your blinds pulled all the time as people will be passing by at all hours. The bar service was excellent again. That's maybe the reason we keep going back. Two friends (Leo and Roger) work the restaurant and the evening service was really good. Lots of variety. One tip...If you are staying for much over a week, eat sensible meals. I've seen people write on here that there is no variety. They probably load their plates with 20 items. After a few days eating like that, the selections WILL seem repetitious. They were putting out more new beach loungers, so there will be more to use, but they will not allow chairs very close to the water, so they are pretty close together.

Not a particularly picturesque ride from the airport but all changed once we got into Playacar which is a beautiful gated community. You felt safe walking about which was a big plus. The hotel was huge and impressive, low rise blocks mean your not climbing loads of stairs and the aircon is perfect for escaping the heat. The rooms are a little bit dated but spotless and a good selection of English language (American) stations if you want to escape the heat or just fancy a film in the evening.The in room minibar is contantly stocked with cold bottled water, pepsi,beer etc which is an essential. Good selection of food - really something for everyone at all times - the steak house is really worth a visit too. Beautiful pool although go and get your loungers early as they fill up fast. If you're going to go into Playa del Carmen (very touristy) then I'd recommend getting a taxi as it's a fair walk and in the humidity you'll end up exhusted. Taxi was only about $5 so hardly anything. Great reps and choice of excursions - we did Chichen Itza which is amazing, a must but take a hat and plenty of sun lotion as it's even hotter a few hours inland. Also swam with Dolphins which was incredible and went out on the Catamaran day which was a blast and got to snorkel around coral reefs. They also teach you a good trick of wearing a lifevest upsidown to make a floting seat! The evening entertainment - well they try very hard. Sometimes ok sometimes a bit poor. Only slight poor point but that's not what we went for so we wern't fussed. If you're room is right next to the entertainment stage though it'd imagine it will be really noisy until about midnight so best ask for a room away if you have children or want to sleep before the early hours.

The bartenders and entertainment staff were great. The buffet wasn't as large as some resorts where we've been, but the food was always good.

Try the shots....they are a specialty here and lots of fun! We had a blast at the theatre area at night with Benito and Florencio:) They serve a liquor similar to Bailey's called \"willy's\" - It was good in the evening. They made Ceasars in the lobby bar and they were quite good - a bit different than Canada but we still enjoyed them. We didn't care for the Japanese restaurant at all but liked the fried ice cream. We enjoyed the steak and spanish restaurants. The homemade salsa and guacamole is to die for:) I took my own coffee maker to use in the room. I do wish they would have been supplied.

After a day and a half we asked for a move and were efficiently moved into block 7, the guy on reception was fantastic so don't be afraid to ask for a move as they realise different people want different things. If you want peace and quiet ask for block 7, 8 or 9. The resort is like a well-oiled machine, staff everwhere, cleaning, gardening etc and it can sometimes feel a bit too much as it doesn't always feel relaxing to sit on your balcony listening to the leaf blower! The rooms are cleaned daily and you will be entertained with some amazing towel art! There are plenty of towels, toiletries (if u want them) and the fridge/optics are replenished every couple of days. The beach is beautiful and lovely to walk on, however the sunbeds were the most uncomfortable things I've ever laid on! We walked to Playa del Carmen along the beach about 30mins at a stroll! You can do it by road too which will take you past some ruins if you are ruin minded! Playa del Carmen is worth a visit but it 's a bit touristy to start with, street vendors always either know you, you've been in their taxi or they're the waiter at your hotel! The further up 5th Avenue you go the less hassle you will get in shops. The jewellery is a bit iffy, be careful about what you buy as lots of it is not solid/stirling whatever they tell you.The entertainment staff work very hard day and night and the shows were very professional, although a lot of what goes on at night on the stage apart from the main show can be a bit difficult to understand as there are so many languages to cover! The drinks are \"interesting\" some are made with a pre mix and don't taste of anything at all e.g. pina colada, tequila sunrise, others are ok, you just have to find something you like! Mojito's were my guilty pleasure! The food was exceptionally varied and there was something for everyone, however lunchtimes were a constant round of burgers, hotdogs and chips as other people have commented on which did wear a bit thin some days. My husband loves fish and our hotel served the same fish day in day out, however we mixed things up a bit and went to the Playacar at night and their fish was fantastic! Not sure we were supposed to do that but we did and had fab fish!! Give it a go! Playacar was good at lunchtimes too. The Tequila across the road was ok for a drink at night and there is a sports bar here with pool tables, gaming machines and sports channels. It was a strange room with no atmosphere and nobody seemed to use it much! The Tequila was very busy and the guests here have use of the beach/pool at the Yucatan which did sometimes lead to a lack of beds. It was always a bit hit and miss and was better later in the day. We didn't see many people tip at the bar and we only tipped our cleaning guy who was great. We used 50% deet for the mossies however you must spray day and night or you will get bitten. We had some morning bites in the first couple of days and sprayed before we went to breakfast after that. I pay tribute to the couple who put in their review that they used vodka as a deterrent which works a treat and doesn't clog your skin like deet! Sorted! Finally, trips are a total rip off! It is cheaper to hire a car, go by bus or book at an independent agent in Playa del Carmen. We shared a car (900 pesos) with Frank and Sue from Michigan to visit Tulum and had a fantastic meal on the way back in Akumel? Drive right down the end of the road as far as you can and there is a great restaurant on the right looking out over the sea.

Evening entertainment is good but I would also recommend that you also see the shows at the Tequila as they are sometimes a little better.

The only downside I can relate to is what other reviews state and thats the room quality; the beds are hard but if you ask for a mattress topper (you may have to ask a couple of times though) then you will get a good night sleep! The other thing is that the rooms do smell of damp and this does seem to linger for a long time, you can even smell the odour upon your return to the UK!

We had a couple of reservations before we went; the size of the place and some of the poorer reviews on this forum. We did however travel with an open mind to judge the place ourselves and what a great time we had. Unless you are a very picky eater, require top shelf alcohol, waiter bar service on the beach and full a la carte dining, you will enjoy yourselves. The hotel has a great location on the beach, spacious well tended grounds and is easy to navigate once you get your bearings. The rooms are clean and spacious. We had two double beds pushed together which were firm but not uncomfortable. The \u2018dressing/shower\u2019 area is separated by a curtain to give some privacy and there is adequate hanging and drawer space for your clothes. The safe was a reasonable size but on the floor and a little awkward to get at (especially for us older guests). It was nice to walk through the grounds to the pool/beach area. There are plenty of trees for shade and you may well see Agouti, Coati, Howler Monkeys and Iguana, plus a few other birds and lizards. We had no problem getting sun beds round the pool and there were plenty more on the beach. It took us about 35 minutes to stroll along the beach to PDC and, over the 2 weeks, we were never approached by and vendors, The food in the buffet was amazing with such a great variety. Our tip is to do a once round to check what\u2019s available otherwise you\u2019ll fill your plate at first station and miss loads of the other options. We only ate at the Asian specialty restaurant, mainly due to the buffet being so good. The sushi/sashimi was excellent, the hot appetizers very good, the mains just average. Leave room for the fried ice cream it was delicious. There was a good range of drinks available but we found the wine not great. The bar service was excellent and you were served immediately, or next, virtually all the time. The staff were all excellent, very friendly and helpful. We wont mention names, far too many and we may miss someone out. Overall, this is a large complex but they have got themselves well organized such that guests are well looked after and are not just part of a crowd. We consider it a 4* hotel with 5* service.

The food is good, the drinks aren't bad, and the staff are hardworking, efficient and genuinely friendly. This is only the second time we've stayed at a Riu but we're beginning to get the impression that they make their money by being reasonably priced and filling them to the gunwales. More expensive hotels can meet their profit margins with lower occupancy, to the obvious benefit of guests (and staff). We were heavily influenced in our choice by the many positive reviews which, on the whole, it deserves. On reflection, though, these were mainly from guests who stayed there during the hurricane season, when occupancy was perhaps lower. During our stay, the tables in the buffet restaurant were so close together it was difficult to walk between them, and you sometimes couldn't see the food on offer because of the queues to get it. Having said that, it never took too long to get served and the hot food was rarely served cold. The speciality restaurants offer a better dining experience but naturally the food choices are more limited. The huge lobby houses reception, lobby bar and lounge area and was noisy most of the time, and allowed smokers, as does the pool area, although the latter wasn't usually rowdy, having few children at this time of year. Nights were quiet in Block 8 and we slept really well nearly every night for the entire fortnight. There were more sunbeds around the pool than we've ever seen before, and nearly all of them under big thatch umbrellas. One reviewer even complained about the lack of sunbathing area, but to us this was a definite advantage. Anyway, there are lots more sunbeds on the beach, all of them without umbrellas. But, on or off the beach, they were difficult to come by after about ten in the morning. My wife enjoys stretching, aerobics and pilates and was disappointed to find these types of activities went on in full sun on the beach. Fortunately, we found that the Riu palace next door ran their classes on a tree-shaded part of the beach so she joined in with them. They didn't seem to mind! To sum up, if you're lucky enough to be at the Yucatan when there are fewer people and no hurricanes you'll find very little to complain about.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whitley Bay, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA great hotel, the staff are very friendly and the service is great.\u201d", "Author": "icepick_12", "ReviewID": "UR123840925", "Content": "We booked this trip last minute and found we had made an excellent choice of hotel.

I never understand the negative reviews it is not the Hilton I would not want it to be. The rooms have charm and are more than adequate for your needs. The staff is beyond helpful, always smiling and willing to make your stay the best it can be. The rooms are not fancy they have ceramic floor throughout and nice size balconies. If you find the mattress uncomfortable ask the front desk for a foam topper and one will be placed on top of the mattress for you. While we were there the entire hotel was booked and we had to wait for a couple of days for one to become available. In the meantime the staff placed some thick blankets under the sheet to help. If you can't find something that you like to eat the problem is with you. There are so many stations in the Hacienda (main dining room) with so many different types of food. They cater to European and North American & Latino tastes. Last time we ate at 2 of the specialty restaurants this time we didn't bother as we didn't want to be tied down by reservations. The soup is really good (was not fussy on the salad but it is January and the lettuce is bitter which I believe is a seasonal issue) We stayed in the 8000 series. Privacy is provided on the balcony by many large trees and bushes. We have requested a 3rd floor room both times mostly because we felt after living a life with that much food and drink for 2 weeks we needed some excercise. We were far enough away from the noise of the beach area but close enough to walk down to the beach in a couple of minutes. Taxis into town a 7.00 we went into Walmart a couple of times to pick up medicine and replace a camera. The front desk will call a taxi for you and at the bottom of the stairs leaving the walmart there is a caged in area with official taxis, We have heard the stories about fake taxi scams and this made us feel safer. One day we walked into Play Del Carmen (the walk is approx 1/2 hour) and visited the main street and the Play Del Carmen mall. There are many bargains to be had at the mall. Do not ever pay the asking price they start very high you usually will end up paying about 2/3 to 1/2. We liked to spend most of the day at the beach, the sand is so soft and doesn't seem to get hot (reserve your chairs early by placing your towel On them) The colour of the water is breath taking the temperature of the water is so warm you will find yourself going back in over and over. The staff rake up the seaweed every morning and bury it in the sand (interesting to watch) so the beach is always clean. Every day we walked down the beach, you can either walk the way of the resorts (not so nice) or walk away from the resorts. Still safe and fenced in. On the walk away we saw hermitt crabs, iguanas and pelicans diving into the water to catch fish. Bring your sandles as towards the end the rocks are a bit jagged under your feet. Every day we walked the entire distance and somebody has placed a plank between 2 rocks as a bench. Amazing scenery and makes a great photo. Beware of the sign in the room that states phone calls are available with credit cards. Last year we made 7 calls (never got through) was charged 20.00 per call (ridiculous amount) Internet is available for 2.00 per minute either in the internet room or two computers in the lobby. I brought my laptop but you do have to be in the lobby to get wifi (your safety deposit box will hold your computer. Last year we booked a fishing expedition through the agent $400.00 this year I booked my husband through Scuba Carribe (located on the beach and affiliated with the Riu) at the cost of 300.00. Last year had to take a taxi this year they picked my husband up on the beach and brought him back to the beach. I'm happy to say he caught 4 barracuda and had the time of his life. Love Benito and Eduardo my two fave bartenders, I reccommend you try a blue ocean on the beach it is a blue slushy with a kick. The entertainment is fun especially when they involve the guests. Coco Bongos is supposed to be worth the trip but my husband and I were up every day at 6 am so the late night would have been to much for us. Our agent wants us to try another place but we will return to the Riu Yucatan.

The rooms are in rough shape: bugs, mildew in fridge, king room was really 2 full size beds pushed together - sheets did not fit and exposed mattress.

Sink was clogged and drained slowly; we asked for non-smoking room and it smelled like cigars; tube TV; wifi only in lobby (these days this is inexcusable); room lost power twice for about hour each; Drinks: liquor was cheap; wine very cheap/nasty - no way to upgrade. Bottled water in room but not served anywhere else (tap only). Coffee was horrible- tasted like mixed with a cleaner (good news is Starbucks walking distance down road); only one beer - Dos XX; food - quality good but limited; must make reservation between 7am-10am for dinner same day - always sold out by 8am but if you complained, you rec'd table; at dinner, restaurants was never full - so I think they force everyone to main buffet restaurant to increase margin. No waiter service for lunch, limited for breakfast (they'll get you coffee), and none for dinner buffet - you have to get everything yourself. Breakfast food - good; lunch they had fish but went cheap with pizza, hamburgers, hot dogs - every day - lots of pasta.

And the pools, though crowed at times, we beautiful and relaxing (especially when you've got a mojito in hand!!) The food was pretty good too. Sure it wasn't 4 Diamond Dinning, but the quality was great and the variety was excellent. The restaurant in the lobby had a wide variety of food, with the options changing every day. While dinner at the lobby restaurant was always great we did check out the specialy restaurants (Asian, Steak House and Mexican) that were available. A reservation was required, which was sometimes difficult to get because you could only make a reservation from 7am - 10am the day of. The reservations for Mexican and Steak House restaurants quickly filled up (and I mean quick! within 20min some days!!). This was a little disappointing, but we quickly learned to show up uber early to make those reservations. The room itself was great. Not modern, but quite nice and CLEAN. I didn't mind that the \"King\" bed was actually 2 doubles pushed together. The bathroom was well lit (too well lit actually!) but the water pressure was fabulous, so how can I complain?? oh, and the BEACH.... how can I forget the beach??? it was FABULOUS!!!.... lots of space and despite all the people it never felt crowed. While hanging out in the sand we saw cool wildlife such as pelicans diving for fish, fishing jumping out of the water and hermit crabs crawling around. Since I'm talking about animals, there were signs all over the resort grounds to not feed the monkeys. Within an 8-day stay we only saw one monkey. He was up high in the tree, but looked like he had some serious 'tude (as in attitude, with a look of \"Whatchu looking at Tourists??\"). There were also dozens of agouti running around... which I kinda liked, they're gentle and their fat bottoms reminded me of my doggies back home :) Weird stuff.... On Xmas day I wanted to call my parents, but had to go to the lobby to do this. Of course I didn't realize until trying 3 times to call from my room. Each time I get this SUPER FAST message in spanish which was hard to understand. I called the front desk and was informed that I would have to come down to the lobby AND that I was going to be charged for each of the calls I had already made! I wasn't too impressed. So be warned, long distance calls need to be made at the front desk. The procedure is kinda stupid. the front desk dials the number for you, speaks to the person on the other end, then transfers the call to a telephone booth where you can pick up the live line. I really didn't like this procedure!! Other weird stuff.... When purchasing some small item in the lobby gift store I used my Visa credit card. I've never seen anyone examine my signature on the back of the card with the one I signed on the receipt so much!! She questioned my ownership of the card and made me resign the damn receipt. Jesus. Maybe the 10 mojitos I had that day affected my signature!?!! Just maybe. Found this totally annoying and offensive. We visited the other Rius in Playacar. Wasn't too crazy about them. Sure they were beautiful, but they were lacking in lush greenery and their beach space wasn't as vast as the Riu Yucatan.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maple Grove, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cLOVED it!!\u201d", "Author": "Tami K", "ReviewID": "UR123271695", "Content": "We just got back from a wonderful vacation at Riu Yucatan.

After that, the food goes down hill, for dinner especially. Stay away from the restaurants Shanghai and Margarita for steak in the evening. The food is not good, and you probably would do better at the regular buffet. My adivce: get out of the hotel and explore the wonderful Riviera Maya and Yucatan Peninsula. We ate outside the hotel many times, simply because we were out and about. Please read the wonderful review posted by someone on trip advisor about renting a car and visiting Chizen Itza, Valladolid, and Coba, all in one day, from the Riviera Maya. My daughter and I speak Spanish fluently and asked many of the locals if they felt it was safe for two women to rent a car and visit these places. The answer was yes, and we felt VERY secure. I was amazed by the security both in Playacar, where the Riu Yucatan is located, and all over the Peninsula as well. Don't miss Akumal if you would like to swim with giant sea turtles, dive, or snorkel. It is an incredible experience, and there is a wonderful restaurant on the beach as well for a delicious lunch at a reasonable price. It was an unforgettable trip. We plan to return many times over.

We finally took a \"proper\" honeymoon after 18 years of marriage. We booked the Yucatan because it was middle-of-the-road as far as price, and we were told that it was nice. Plus, you don't spend alot of time in your room, right? Or so we thought, but it is still part of the package. Anyhow, we are ignorant to travel, having been working our entire marriage on eliminating debt, starting our own business and raising our 3 great kids. And we were told to be cautious when in Mexico; there are a lot of shysters in Mexico that will take advantage of ignorant Americans that don't speak spanish. For this reason, we were immediately 'on guard' when we were offered an upgrade upon check-in. (It turns out, we are nearly certain that they (Riu mgmt) flags couples that are there for the first time, hoping they will make repeat visits to the more expensive resort) The front desk staff was genuinely friendly and helpful at the Yucatan, and they swore that the sister Riu resort up the street was much nicer. But, they wouldn't let us go view before making a decision. So we chose to stay put. Not good;-) When shown to our room, we immediately had buyers remorse. It was dingy and unimpressive. Old furniture, color scheme, and run down looking. The meal that night in the dinner buffet was good, with good selection. But, for the entire night, my wife and I both had a sinking feeling, because we were so hyped up for an all-star vacation in a 'pampered' environment. The next morning, we asked the front desk (same friendly face) if they would still honor their offer. And, after consulting the manager an hour later, they agreed to extend the offer again, and we could move to the other resort after lunch. Since this review is just for the Yucatan, I won't say much more. Except this: if you are offered a free 'upgrade' to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya, TAKE IT!!!! The Palace is incredible, and our vacation there was everything we were hoping for. We couldn't believe our good fortune. We fell in love with it, just as they (Riu) hoped we would, and we will be going back there in February 2012.

We arrived on New Years Eve and were expecting a party and a relaxing holiday to follow, However, after a chaotic check in, we were very disspapointed with our room, so much so that we thought about transfering to another hotel. First impressions count particularly after the 11 hour flight and 1 hour transfer time. The room was so outdated that we felt robbed for the amount of money we paid for what we thought we be a 5 star accomadation. We didnt unpack the first night and headed straight for the bar to drown our sorrows. Our room was on the ground floor at the start of the accomadation block, the noise throughout the holiday from people walking by and going back to rooms, was so annoying, not a decent night sleep (even with ear plugs) that the best sleep you got was around the pool during the dya even with the entainment music blaring!! The smell of the room was disgusting, we spent one evening at the local shops in Playcar trying to buy an air fresher, we settled with a bottle of vanilla, so that the room was a little more bearable. The cleaner did a good job of cleaning our room, i think by the end of the holiday, he knew why we had ashtrays of vanilla about the room as more bleach was used and this helped with the sewage smell. The other thing we thought was a bit bizzarre was no light in the shower, so the shower curtain had to be open to allow you to see what you were doing. There was no light on the patio are a either, our room looked over the gardens with no lights so basically if you want to sit outside after the sun goes down, then you will be sitting in the dark. We spoke to our rep the next day and she didnt seem bothered that we didnt like the accomadation, basically we couldnt move rooms because the hotel was full and all rooms were the same. The positives of this hotel is : * It sits on the beutiful Playacar beach * It is within walking distance of Playa del Carmen * Staff work extra hard but dont expect tips Think twice about booking this hotel, after reading reviews since retiurning, it seems thae sewage smell is a common complaint about this hotel.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hanska, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "rockinrandal", "ReviewID": "UR122971917", "Content": "Yucatan was great experience.

This was our fourth trip to the Playa del Carmen 'strip' having stayed at hotels with lesser ratings, much less cost and much better accommodation, service and food. At Hotel Riu Yuck, not only was the food vastly inferior, to eat at \"A la Carte\" restaurants, you could only reserve any one of the three from 7 to 10 the same morning and reservations were \"full\" before 8 every morning. After 3 days we were graciously permitted to book the day before, after having complained to the manager, William (who must have been in great pain for he was never seen to smile). So the evening of the fourth day, with much hunger and heightened excitement at the thought of attending a real Steak house, we arrived at the restaurant. Most of my family ordered steak. When a plate of flat, 1/4\" overcooked meat arrived - looking more like a burnt (read: very overcooked) pancake than a juicy sirloin steak, it was obvious that the previous attempts to reserve our \"haut cuisine\" were futile and that we would not be attempting either of the remaining exotic fine dining affairs! Yes, the workers that do all the grunt work for disparate pay relative to their \"superiors\" were always happy to serve whatever they were serving. Especially the bartenders, most notably \"Laura\" who always had a smile for her customers even when she was working alone and run off her feet.

We were there the week of Christmas 2011 and appreciated the Christmas music and decor. We arrived on xmas eve and right away I couldn't believe that Signature Vacations rated this hotel as a 5 star. It is 3 AT BEST. Everything in the hotel is so outdated. There was 5 of us on this vacation; my parents had one room, and myself, my sister, and my cousin shared another. We were told there would be 3 beds but the 2 double beds pushed together to make a king sized bed would suffice so we wouldn't have to waste room putting a cot in the room. You are given 1 key per room and a safe key (which is helpful). I really think this hotel should start by updating their actual key locks into key cards. I dreaded coming back to this room. The beds were hard as rock and the blankets were so itchy and smelly, that even though it is chilly in Mexico in December, I braved the chill and only slept with sheets. The bathroom sink had rust rings formed and our shower did not drain the whole time we were there (makes me disgusted even writing this!). We called down to have someone unclog the drain and ended up having 3 different people coming up (with no tools nonetheless) and 3 different times to unclog it. We decided to give up and not switch rooms since we were only there for a week and already settled in. So our showers ended up being 2 minutes long each so we wouldn't flood the room. The last few days I was so grossed out I ended up showering in my parent's shower next door which was also clogged but the maintenance people ended up unclogging it. I won't even go there. Most of the staff were friendly, but expect a rude comment if all you're going to tip is $1 dollar bills. The first few days the food was ok. I have already been to all inclusives in Mexico so I knew what to expect. In Mexico,Xmas Eve is celebrated more than Xmas Day so there was huge feast that would have been nice to know about before hand since there was nowhere to eat until the dinner started at around 6:30. There is no room service and the stated 24/7 food is a little cooler in the lobby filled with unappealing looking packaged sandwhiches. Had a little laugh at that. All inclusive to me means there should at least be one place to get food or room service 24 hours a day, this became inconvienent because there were windows during the day i.e. 10:30-1 and 4-6:30 and anytime after 9:30 when you want a little snack but there is nowhere to eat (some of the days the buffet closest to the beach would still be open while transitioning to an a la carte steak or mexican restaurant but they'd only offer stale chips and salsa). We only ate at the a la carte steak restaurant because to book a time you'd have to get up at 7 am and after half an hour it is fully booked anyways. The breakfast buffet is by far the best with healthy options like yogurt, granola,hard boiled eggs, smoothies and whole wheat bread. Closer to the end of the week, I was so sick of going into the buffet I went into the gift shop in the lobby to grab chips that I shortly put back onto the shelf after being told that a bag of Lays is $9 US and a bag of Chex Mix is $14 (cashier said because these items are \"US imported\"). Basically, if you're going on a vacation just for the food-don't come here. Other than that, you can get by the week by dragging yourself to the buffet to find something to eat. The beach is gorgeous. After 8 am it is extremely difficult to find a free lounge chair so we set our alarms for 7:30 and went and put our beach stuff on the chairs to save them before breakfast. I didn't go in the pools once the whole time I was there, but on a rainy cold day all I wanted was a hottub-which they don't have. They have a circular tub with jets that looks like a hottub, but the water is just cold pool water. The bartenders are extremely hardworking and the lobby bar did make one of the best mojitos I have ever tasted, but I think people figure out the lobby bar makes the best drinks out of the hotel so it takes awhile to be served. The hotel is in a good location, only a $7 cab ride to town (you have to go to town, very lively and treat yourself to one of the restaurants there, you won't be dissapointed), or a 25 minute walk. All in all I feel like I've been cheated into thinking this would be a 5 star experience and am very disappointed.

We went for 7 days in December, 2011. The weather was chilly and windy. The ocean was too cold to swim and pools not heated, but scenery beautiful as always. No sand whales. Many plastic beach chairs were grimy with dirt. Many cushions were ripped and need to be replaced. Sadly, we come on a beach holiday to swim in the ocean and this did not happen. It was cloudy and rained every day although not heavily. Europeans and visitors from the Neatherlands and Canada we met seemed to like the weather fine, perhaps because it is freezing in those countries. We were grateful we had brought our sweat shirts and hoodies. Mattresses hard and bedding thin and scanty. 2 double beds pushed together with seperate bedding Walls not insulated well. Ancient, rather fuzzy tv in room. Take a good white noise machine because if you are near screaming children as we were you may not be able to sleep. No elevators so seniors request a room on ground floor. Showers tiny, dark and a bit dangerous to climb in and out of because of the rim. Shampoo provided in small metal packages which were impossible to open without sharp object or teeth. Only one towel per person per day given. Towels old and poor quqlity. Thin blanket on bed. Pillows flat and old. Our room was dark. Maid was cheerful and made cute towel sculptures. We gave her $2.00 oer day. Lobby sofas were horrible. Wifi only works in lobby so get a stick for your laptop or activate international to Mexico on your mobile phone. Otherwise you will be trapped in the lobby in the sofas which sink down due to old age or no springs and are soiled. Wifi is slow. If you buy a phone card you may need help using it. We had to have the front desk help us make the connection as it wouldn't work from our room the first few times we tried. There is a charge of 2 or 3 dollars for each call you make. Loud and annoying music is played in the lobby morning to night. Not conducive to relaxation. Food was a disappointment and was pretty much the same every day. Service was medicore. The fruit selection was poor. No strawberries, melon was tasteless. No blueberries or blackberries. Like dorm food. Steak restaurant was not good. We couldn't eat our steaks which were fatty and tough. They never heard of filet mignon. Only \"house\" wine offered in red or white. No champagne. Fish was an unknown variety; the same small pieces every day floating in a greasy pool of gravy. No shrimp the 7 days we were there. And no room service. If you come in late or want a snack after the dining hall closes at 10:30 there are sandwiches in a small fridge behind the bar consisting mostly of mayo with a thin slice of reconstructed meat of some sort and a lettuce leaf. No microwave or coffee pot in room. No ice sculptures. Desserts were reminiscent of Walmart frozen food section and croissants were chewy and hard. Bar in lobby served good drinks. Many smokers blowing cigarette and even cigar smoke everywhere. No designated smoking areas. I think they must sprayed DDT over the grounds when guests were sleeping. The room smelled strongly of insecticide and all our clothes had to be washed twice when we returned to get rid of the fumes. We took bread back to the room every day and enjoyed feeding the Sereques from the patio. They look like a combo of rabbits/hamsters/ kangaroos and stand on their hind legs.

The food is of the best quality, especially the deserts and the tropical fruits, and the rooms are excellent and well provided with all sorts of drinks. The beach is first class, with white sand and turquoise waters, a true paradise. Together with the beach the best thing about this location is the fact that you are actually surrounded by the jungle. While there we saw iguanas, monkeys, coatis, and quite a few other creatures. Playa del Carmen is just 30 minutes away walking and it is a nice little town, well worth visiting. If you want to see the real city just wander away from the 5th avenue which is the most touristic street. The town is safe and truly welcoming. Now, the highlight of this trip were the visits to the Mayan ruins in Chichen Itza and Coba. Nothing I tell you will be even close to explain what magical places these ruins are. We got the chance to climb the pyramid at Coba and the view of the jungle was phenomenal. We also visited a Mayan village and there we saw the most beautiful butterfly in the world, the blue morpho...magical stuff. To top up you are taken to swim in the cenotes. Just google cenote and you will see what I mean. My only advice, if you do go down to swim wear a vest, because some of them (especially the sacred cenote at Chichen Itza) are very deep.

However the staff on reception and the rep Tess went all out to find us a more suitable alternative and get us moved as soon as possible, and thats when our holiday started! The hotel is a little dated, could use some new furniture, i.e. the tables and chairs in reception are a bit tatty and the decor is a bit drab which didn't give the greatest first impression, but the standard of hygiene was excellent, everything was constantly being washed and tidied so compensated for this, Id rather sit on a clean tatty chair than a fancy dirty one! The staff whatever their roles are so pleasant, whether this is their training or the nature of the people I can only guess but I could fault no-one in behaviour or how they carried out their duties, even the manager could be seen on a daily basis, interracting with guests, checking everything was ok, a very affable chap! We didn't do any trips as we have been before and just needed to chill, beach was beautiful, clean, plenty of beds but no umbrellas so if you need shade you have to get under the palm trees or go to the pool but this wasn't an issue in December as the cloud gives sufficient respite from the sun along with the odd cooling shower, still got a lovely tan though! You can walk for miles along the beach, to the left is the ferry port but to the right its stunning, quiet, scenic with rocks and lizards, small bays with the jungle to the back of the beach. This was our exercise when we could motivate ourselves, along with the daily beach yoga-excellent and varied several times during the week. For the more energetic there is beach volley ball, football, water sports, all sorts and round the pool water aerobics, dance lessons, just loads to do if you want to. Best part of the day? Meal time!!! Food excellent and so varied, fresh, cooked in front of you and in the whole 2 weeks I only saw 2 flies in the restaurant, how do they do that?!! I'm neurotic about food hygiene but this place met my standards-5 star plus on that! Evening entertainment was a little disappointing, as we tend to go to bed early we missed most the shows (they don't start till 10) but the bar staff make up for that with their delightful personalities and we got chatting to some really nice people so that compensated. If you like wildlife there are varied lizards-look carefully they blend in well, colourful birds and parrots, Agouti, Coati and if you're lucky the monkeys will visit, Howler monkeys, a massive troupe-WITH BABIES!!! We had a lovely time here, excellent value for money, what we ate and drank probably would have cost the price of the holiday, would highly recommend it, only reason I gave it a 4 star was as stated it's a bit dated and the rooms do smell musty.

We lost our first choice because we waited too long to make a decision. We decided on the Yucatan. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we felt like we were home. We traveled with our two children 6 and 7 and have nothing but fantastic memories and praise to tell our friends about this resort. It was beautiful, tranquil and perfectly located. The resort is meticulously cared for by very friendly and professional staff. The food was OUTSTANDING! Our 7 yr old is a somewhat picky eater but had absolutely no trouble finding something for himself. The selection in La Hacienda breakfast, lunch and dinner was never boring. There were other restaurants however like I said the selection at La Hacienda was perfect for us. Always clean. Always a different theme every night with accompanying drinks. Never ending tequila a.k.a Mexican water! The Yucatan is one of three or five depending how you look at it. If you stay at the Riu Yucatan, Tequila or Lupita you can play at one of the other. There are two additional Riu Palaces' but you cannot play at them however you can stay at the Palaces' and play at five. Our agent suggested we choose Yucatan b/c out of the other three it is on the ocean and the other two resorts play at the Yucatan, it has the other amenities the others lack. Technically the Yucatan is not a 5 star resort but it's allowed to say this b/c if you combine all the activities/restaurants/sports from all three resorts, Signature states it's a 5 star. The Palaces' are a true 5 star. With that said, we were NOT disappointed at all. Unexpected perfection this trip was and we cannot wait to go back. The beach is breathtakingly magnificent. The beach stretched on and on either way and clean. Although there was the odd litter bug the staff were quick to clean it up. The ocean was the perfect blend of electric blue to turquoise depending on the depth and weather. The fish were beautiful as were the pelicans eating them, Arctic Turns running up and down the coast line. On our first day in the ocean I spotted a Barracuda and found out when we were home a woman was bitten by one accidentally r/t someone feeding the surrounding fish, not at our resort but that doesn't matter. On our first morning we were woken up by a howler monkey and his family. Four mornings straight at 4 a.m.. They left the resort after the fourth day. There were birds, Iguana's and other cute critters the kids just loved. The kids (us too) loved so much about the resort. We cannot wait to return. We took the kids to Dolphinaris which is one of the companies. We chose this company b/c it was in total a four hours and we know our kids :) It is an experience that has no words. It was not my first time swimming/interacting with dolphins but it was for my Husband and children. It will be an official must do every time we're there. We'll eventually try all the companies, LOL! Mexico has kept a piece of our hearts. We had planned on taking the kids to other excursions however we chose to wait until they're older. My Husband and I have been to Mexico before, we have been on a few excursions and felt the kids should be older. We also walked throughout Playa del Carmen. Fantastic merchants and keep sakes. Can't say enough about the friendly locals. Wonderful country and heartwarming people. We flew with Sunwing. We arrived at the airport to find out there were mechanical difficulties with our plane and there was going to be a delay. As the time went on we realized we were the only people at our gate waiting. As people started to arrive to board our new plane flown in, 9 hours later, we all got talking and they were all notified of the delay by phone. We were not. We were the only people there with young children that waited for 9 hours in an airport! That fault is not with Sunwing but with our agent. We arrived exhausted to Mexico at 2 a.m.. Sunwing had a coach bus pick all passengers up and it should have been a 25 minute ride to the resort however the bus dropped every person off at every resort therefore the ride ended up being 2 1/2 hours. Up for 23 solid hours with young children. Not very impressed. We lost a full paid for day sitting and waiting for a new plane to be brought out of a hanger and a VERY long shuttle to the resort once we landed. Immigration and customs were very professional and fast, Thank God! We understand mechanical difficulties and feel relieved to have had a properly functioning plane. The staff aboard Sunwing were professional and very pleasant. They looked as exhausted as we did. We went to Riu Yucatan mid Novemeber, the weather was spectacular btw, we are planning on returning in the spring if not sooner. My Daughter and I were teary when we left. We went for 7 days, next time it's a minimum of 10! Thank you Riu Yucatan for an experience we will always cherish. We can't wait to go back!

The room was OK, we had several small issues (the fridge wasn't working), it was attended to immediately, however it still was not working properly and when I notified the front desk it was promptly replaced. The other issue was the iron, it leaked and, again, when staff was notified it was promptly replaced. The bed was extremely hard (not just me being fussy, many other people had the similar complaint), again, when the front desk was notified , housekeeping showed up promptly to install multiple layers of padding, not perfect but it was an improvement. We had dinner in the main buffet restaurant, you could eat inside in the air conditioned area or sit outside in the veranda area, lots of food choices and the service was attentive. Every member of the staff that we dealt with was very helpful and courteous, tipping isn't required bit I did when warranted or appreciated the attentive service. The next morning we had an orientation meeting with our Sun Wing holiday rep, Oscar, he informed us about the hotel (and sister properties) and of the various tours that were available (naturally a bit of a sales job but informative). They do offer to change money at the front desk however the rates in downtown Playa are substantially better, it's your choice. The in room liquor dispenser has your choice of Tequilla, Amber Rum, Gin or Vodka; the Tequilla was a name brand but other liquors were the cheapest slop I've ever tasted and they only have one brand of beer on the entire premises, XX Dos Equis (bottles in the room and on tap at the bars). We walked to Playa the next day, nice walk, approx 3kms, walked the famous 5th Ave, found a 'Mega' store and p/u a few items (beer and wine), to stock the fridge to our liking, took a cab home, $70 pesos. We tried each of their three restaurants (the Steakhouse, the Asian and the Mexican) none of them were overly special just less crowded (and that's not just our opinion, we chatted with several other couples who readily agreed), also they have the poorest choice of house wine I have ever tasted, again, everybody expressed their disdain for the poor quality. If we had known that their alternative restaurants were that basic we would have gone to Playa for more evening dinners. The breakfasts were good, the lunches were basic fare. The pool and beach area is quite nice, lots of room and loungers to set up for the day. One complaint we have is the hotel's smoking policy, it's disgusting so be warned. My other complaint is their Internet service or lack thereof. It was only available in the lobby area (where smoking was unabashedly allowed, like it was the cure!). A resort complex/corporation of the size of Riu could certainly have Wi-Fi available throughout their property, the world is connected and everybody had their either their laptop/iPad/smart phone with them.

I should say from the outset that we enjoyed a very quiet holiday and deliberately avoided the entertainment team and Coco Bongos. We're also beach-goers so didn't go into the pools at all, but noticed they were kept meticulously clean. So, the hotel is lovely and we disagreed with other reviewers' comments about it needing an update. Our room was standard but huge, with a lovely, spacious bathroom, a free safe and loads of storage space. We were in block 1 with a lovely quiet location close to the reception area. The temperature in December was lovely and warm without the humidity and heat of the warmer months, so we were able to sleep with just the insect screen separating our room from the balcony. We're early risers so loved being woken by the sound of the wind rustling the lush, dense palm trees right outside our room and the the birds' singing. We like firm mattresses so the bed was lovely and we had plenty of towels in the room. It would be nice to have some lifts though as we were on the third floor and had four bags, two of which were heavy with scuba diving kit. So, here's what we liked: breakfast on the restarant terrace overlooking the lush gardens (heaven! - missing it already), the food in the restaurant (just about anything you could wish for - what do people find to moan about?), lovely warm, clean beach towels each day, excellent service from all the staff, the detailed welcome meeting and Thomson rep availability, proximity to the beach, which was kept reasonably clean and was just a few paces away from the pool, free cocktails, the choice we had to participate in or avoid the numerous daytime activities (stretching/yoga, salsa and Spanish lessons, beach volleyball, beach football, etc) - there's nothing worse than lying on a quiet beach only to have the silence ruined by loud music. If you wanted the action and loud music you could get it, but if like us you have busy lives and liked to relax, it was easily avoided. The choice was lovely. Similarly, the hotel Operations Manager was very visible and if you wanted to chat to him, you could. The animation team greeted us for dinner each evening and invited us to join in the show, but we went for a nice, quiet walk after dinner and didn't see any of the evening shows. The weather was lovely - yes, it was December so you needed to have a cardigan or wrap round your shoulders in the evening for the odd breezy, cool evening. If you want humidity and heat above 30 degrees - don't go in December! The dive centre on site, Scubacaribe, were quite friendly, reliable and the staff were good, especially if you bother to learn a few basic greetings in Spanish. My G.C.S.E/improving Spanish opened more than a few doors as several of the dive centre staff didn't speak English. The greeting and support from Thomson on arrival was superb - friendly, informative and a very welcome beer on the coach en route to the hotel after an 11-hour flight. What could be improved - the wine is dreadful and there is only the house red and white. We ate at the Asian restaurant and were disappointed to find it quite cold (over-zealous air conditioning) and it was brightly lit. We didn't eat at the mexican or steak restaurants but looked at them - including the main restaurant there didn't appear to be anywhere to have a romantic dinner. The main and Asian restaurants were brightly lit and functional - anything but romantic. It is overall not quite a 4-star hotel. The lack of lifts, as mentioned above, was a bit of a nuisance. The dive centre's boats run off the beach so if you're a novice diver consider doing your boat and drift specialities in advance. Getting out to the boats through the surf can be very challening on windy days. If the hotel wants to be 4-star it needs to provide a few more nicer touches, like a proper Spa (not just a glorified tent right by the poolside), complimentary bathrobes in the rooms and nicer toiletries. My husband arranged for a DVD to be delivered to the hotel following his dive in the Cenotes and it got temporarily lost in the Reception area. They need to brush up a little on guest services by putting deliveries in a central place and letting guests know when a message or parcel has been delivered. All in all though, these are minor gripes. The worst element of the holiday was the inaccuracy of the Thomson excursion description for the Jungle Maya excursion. We went expecting a dry day, travelling in jeeps, doing zip-wiring and a bike ride with the option of snorkeling in a cenote. What we got was a wet day, abseiling into a cenote, zip wiring between platforms and one into a cenote and snorkelling in them - we were wet practically all day. No bike ride whatsoever, but when we raised this with one of the Thomson reps he apologised and explained the excursion had not been reviewed for some time - at least they listened and apologised so fair enough. In total contrast to the arrival service from Thomson, the escort back to the airport was not very friendly. To be fair, they picked us up on time and got us to the airport, including telling us where to check-in but the friendly customer service was completely missing. A couple of recommendations - take insect repellant containing Deet - it's the only guaranteed way to avoid insect bites, take a cardigan/wrap/shawl for the evenings in December, ask for a room on the ground floor if you have heavy bags, avoid blocks near the pool area if you like to go to bed early, go for an early morning stroll on the beach (with insect repellant) and watch the sun rise, go to Sian Ka'an biosphere if you like nature but avoid the excursion if you have any joint problems as the trip in and out of the area takes two hours along some of the most pot-hole-ridden roads in the world, do zip-wiring in the jungle, snorkle or dive the Cenotes but take a rash vest as they're a little chilly, eat breakfast on the terrace and learn a bit of Spanish before you go. Overall - take great care over your baggage weight. We paid for extra baggage in advance to accommodate our heavy scuba diving kit and although we were underweight on our home scales and at Manchester, we were 2kgs over at Cancun and had to pay. Strange that? No negotiation was possible so we had to pay \u00a334. Beware the Cancun scales! Make sure you sort out the thieving 'departure tax' well in advance too - it has to be paid in cash in pesos, dollars, Euros or Sterling. Thomson tell you about it at the welcome meeting.

Having been to Mexico and stayed at the five star Royal for my honeymoon 3 years previous, i revisited Mexico with my best mate (36 & 42) and chose the Yucatan due to its good reviews and use of other hotels. While it was not the Royal, it was clean, had a good location and the staff were so friendly it didnt matter if you tipped or not, you still got the same service. Check in was a breeze, met with a cool drink, given your keys and sent on your way leaving the staff to bring your luggage soon after. We were in block 9 which was behind the hotel farthest from the pool etc but quiet so no problems hearing noises from reception or bars. Yes the key is a little inconvienient however we took the room key and safe key off its huge fob and used a keyring to carry them with us (fitted in our bags then) . The room was clean and pleasant... yes a little tired but had an excellent shower and hairdryer. The bed was extreamly comfortable and the room was cleaned daily. On exploring other areas of the hotel everything was spotless and there was always a member of staff cleaning somewhere. All areas were nice and cool and the bar staff worked hard to ensure you were not kept waiting too long for drinks. Entertainment was cheesy but gave you something to watch and their were specialist acts brought in quite often who performed either in the theatre, reception or restaurant. Food was great, i am quite fussy but found something to eat every day, there is a really good selection to please all palates and it is hot and plentiful despite what time you decide to dine. we tried all restaurants and the food was good in all although i prefered the steakhouse and asian as opposed to the mexican but that was due to personal taste not quality of food. Pool area and beach were lovely, we spent all our time on the beach as there was always a nice breeze and plenty of people watching to do. Sunbeds were always available and you could always find shade if need be, there was also a variety of watersports to enjoy or sights to see for example watching the pelicans and seabirds dip to catch fish. We booked 3 trips via Thompson and although a bit dearer than booking else where, were well worth the money, coco bongos a must....what a nite, the pirate ship for familys..really entertaining and great food and service and then Xel Ha, what a day, we got there early and practically had the park to ourselves, we walked to the lazy river dodging iguanas etc on the way (all harmless) relaxed down the river, attempted the rope walk (need shoes for this) and enjoyed several goes on the ziplines....it was a great all inclusive day and the food and provisions at the park were excellent !. All in all it was a great holiday, all staff were really welcoming and helpful, the area is clean if a little dated but that adds to the charm and the food was great...............would i return ??? With my friends yes or for a cheaper getaway with the hubby definately ....but if you want complete luxury and five star service this maybe is not the place for you so try the royal in Playa or cancun ?? Where ever you choose to stay in mexico i dont think you will be disappointed.its a beautiful country with beautiful people...........just a shame its 10 hours away :-( We took mexican peso and dollars..... can use both in the shops and for trips Word of warning at the airport for return DO NOT go over your luggage allowance, i got stung on my honeymoon so took extra kg this time.they will charge you \u00a317 per kg over and be careful what you put as handluggage.no fancy candles etc or chargers x One more thing.............i lost my ipod touch..ouch...on the last day ( must have been the upset of going home) so if anyone found it (as it has not yet been handed in) could you please let me know as it was a pressie from my hubby who couldnt make the holiday x", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilmington", "Title": "\u201cA slice of paradise\u201d", "Author": "CollinsKent", "ReviewID": "UR121492563", "Content": "A little late in reviewing this hotel but had to write something as had one of the best holidays we have ever had. We flew from Gatwick and stayed at the Riu sadly only for 1 week, it is a long way to go but still well worth it. We flew with Thomson and had a 10 hour flight but with the 6 hour time difference, it did take a few days to get over the jet lag but with the beach to sleep on during the day and the gorgeous cocktails to drink in the bars, it wasn't a hardship! The transfer was quick, about 30 minutes and arrived at the hotel to be greeted with a cocktail and our room key and details, very quick and very organised. We left our bags to be brought to the room whilst we went ahead. We stayed in room 5010 I think, which was 3 rooms down on the ground floor for where you collect your pool/beach towels so it was very close to the entertainment area. This only bothered us the first night when we were tired and wanted to sleep but there after we were up and out until early hours every night anyway but if you do want sleep before midnight then do get a room further away. The room was lovely, large, clean and had a great size bathroom with a good hairdryer (so ladies you don't need to bring one, I didn't). Our eyes lit up when we saw the free bar in the room! so necked a tequilla and went to have a nose around. Pool area is gorgeous! 2 swim up bars, loads of sunbeds and shelter and you never have to fight for one and just beyond that is the most amazing beach. Still after 7 days of being there, everytime I saw it, it took my breath away. The sea was warm warm warm! and the beach was never packed but had enough people on it that there was always a lovely vibrant atmosphere. You don't need to bring any towels with you as everything is provided by the hotel. You can get your drinks at the bar and take them to the beach, so everything is catered for. Everyday around the pool they had something going on at all times and also did beach volleyball and did a beach party once during the day with a band which was lovely. The bar and the entertainment area were great, 2 great bars with great people serving you. The 2nd night we were there we gave our barmen the equivilant of about \u00a35 and he took good care of us, we never had to ask for a drink it was always waiting for us but we mainly did it as the service is fantastic, amazing, smiley people. Food is lovely so much of it and again the serive is spot on. One thing that did used to annoy me was the other guests wasting food!!! Often we would see people walk away having left piles of food on their plates. I found it so rude and greedy. You can go back as many times as you want so don't be a careless pig! We did 2 trips whilst there booked through our rep which was the cheapest dolphin trip which was great, only 6 of us in the group and had a great time but we went at 7am so possibly best to go first thing. We used the Tequilla hotel one night, entertainment area great and again bar lovely but the shows they put on weren't for us, but some like it I suppose. The night club in tequilla is awful! Also (and the highlight of the trip) was a visit to Coco Bongo's!!! You HAVE to go there. My husband and I love to party and go to festivals every year so really fancied it and were not disappointed. We again booked through our rep and because we booked the dolphin trip too we got 2 tickets for \u00a335. Do not bother going VIP just do what we did, pay via rep and turn up and queue at 10.30pm, we got in fine and a lovely waiter gave us a seat by a table so we pretty much an area to ourself without having to pay!!! but go early to get in. Soon as you walk in as we did at 10.30pm you are served drinks and up dancing on the bar! great fun...every town should have a Coco Bongo's! We left there at 4am.....and had to fly home morning so wasn't feeling to good but worth it! I really can't say enough about this place, it is fantastic and I truely can't wait to get back. Food amazing, beach amazing, pool fantastic, staff superb, weather gorgeous (apart from the day we arrived but we had the tale end of Rina)!

So, when I wanted to surprise my entire family for a winter getaway I of course booked this hotel right away. I figured we couldn't go wrong... The facilities are still ok - but it is not kept up and is definitely looking very tired and dated. The kids pool was all cracking, and the rooms are dim and so-so. If you are bringing smaller children, remember to bring an umbrella stroller as the resort is very large. So just getting from the pool, to your room, to dinner etc. is a lot of work for little legs! We also found that the service was not nearly comparable to what we had received the first time around. They didn't really seem to care if you were happy or not. The food is fine. We did not get sick, but they have added a lot more \"north american\" fare. I think they should stick to the awesome mexican cuisine they do best. Our biggest beef (& it's a HUGE one), is that we booked our trip WAY in advance & when we got there to our \"Beach Vacation\", the beach was closed. Yes, COMPLETELY closed... They were doing major construction of the ugly massive sand bags, which had to be done. But that would have been planned way in advance and they did not tell ANY of the travellers who had spent their hard earned money that the beach would be closed for the duration of our trip. No sand, no ocean. It was nerve rattling loud and dusty and they event worked through the nights! We did not even get a sorry, or discounted rate for the trouble. And I bought all inclusive trips for 5 people!!! Brutal. Out of frustration we did cab it downtown to the public beach, but you couldn't leave anything on the beach (including your towel or shoes) so it was pointless, and not nearly as nice as the private beach at Yucatan. The only good thing I can say about Yucatan is the activity staff. They work their butts off and do a great job with the very limited resources they are given. As a business owner, I know that it is easy to get first time business, but you have to WORK very hard to keep people coming back as repeat customers. The Riu Yucatan left us feeling deflated and scammed after our second trip and I would never recommend it again. Having said that, most of the other resorts right in the vicinity are great so you have lots to choose from. I'm sorry to sound negative, but this is not a way to treat anyone spending thousands of dollars for a 5 star vacation.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cFair, Not 4 Star\u201d", "Author": "730gb123730", "ReviewID": "UR121066336", "Content": "We spent five nights at Riu Yucatan. Would I stay there again? Probably not, however you do get what you pay for. Check in? We were early, so we had to wait, but we were prepared enough to pack swim suits and sunscreen in our carry on. There was no bell service. They just told us to leave our luggage sitting in the lobby. (For someone to steal....NOT!)....One look on my face and they quickly offerered to store our luggage behind the front desk. They did give us our bracelets and towel cards since our room wouldn't be ready for a few hours. There were no towels available at the pool and it was only Noon. They told me to come back in 30 minutes. (Three times).. We never got towels that day, but did get our room at 4 p.m. Our room was great. We had a suite....the only way to go. In Block 3, which was in the middle of the complex. We discovered our room mini-bar (refrigerator) wasn't working the next morning. We called and they repaired/replaced sometime that afternoon. Food? I have zero complalints of the food that was offered. The buffets were always clean, fresh, plentiful, and many options. We have been to Mexico over ten times and the food here was as good or better as anywhere we have been. Our young daughter especially enjoyed the fresh made pizzas that were there during lunch and dinner. Negatives on the food.....there was nothing by the pool. All resorts we've stayed have had food by the pool bar. You have one lunch buffet offered and that's it until dinner time. Major negative for us. Dinners - the buffet was good. Again very plentiful with some of the same options and some different. If you want to book one of the three restaurants, you have to be in the breakfast area by 7 am because it books fast. We ended up with the steak house twice and it was actually very good. The late sitting is not until 8:45 and if you are on eastern time, it is going to be after 10 pm before you eat. Entirely too late and the sittings aren't even at capacity when the hotel is sold out. However to reitterate, the steak house food and service was spectaculor. Bar service at the pool and lobby was hit and miss. We were the only people we saw who tipped the entire time we were there. If they tipped, I missed it. It was a good crowd. Only a few children were there and it is a family resort. As we have a young daughter, we were glad to see some children there. The beach was very very lovely. The sand was soft, clean, and cool. The water was warm. The beach was crowded, but it was Thanksgiving week. The pool was nice. You did have to get there by 8:30 a.m. however to snag a good chair. On day 3, the resort ran completely out of beer. This was somewhat ridiculous since you are paying for all inclusive. The poor bartenders would just shrug their shoulders, but really....it wasn't their fault, but still absurd. Day 4, no electricity in our room during the middle of the night. We woke up to no lights or outlets......wow, one more aggravation. We callled the next morning and it was repaired right away. Showers in the dark. Not fun. The beds were hard, but as other reviews state, you can call and they are willing and happy to put a padding on the mattress. It was exciting to see the monkeys and wildlife around. They were very very very loud about 3 a.m., lol, so if you aren't a sound sleeper, it may sound like you are in a zoo. The resort was okay, not fabulous, but again, you get what you pay for. It is not a five or four star resort. I give it a 3 1/2 at the most. Only because of some outdatedness and the issues of no towels at the pool (two days), running out of beer. Oh, also, no room service options. What's the deal with that? Wi-Fi is available, but only from the lobby bar area. That's it. I would go back, but only if it was a deal.

Party of 9 of us stayed here 6 adults and 3 children 12, 13, 14 We were all excited about staying at this hotel as it\u2019s had some amazing reviews on here but I\u2019m afraid to say we were all a little disappointed with some of our experiences. Upon arriving we were greeted with a refreshing drinking a young girl who you could barely hear giving check in instructions. We needed four rooms I would have thought that since the hotel decided to put all the children in one room despite having different surnames at the very least they could do would be to put them next to an adults room whom was travelling within the party but No all the adults was on one side of block 2 and the children was in the other side on the top floor, we did a bit of jigging around and got the rooms how we wanted and let reception know. Although they didn\u2019t pay any attention as the rooms were still catered for how they initially allocated them so subsequently some rooms didn\u2019t have enough towels or toiletries etc. The daytime entertainment was not up to much to be honest we like to get involved in team games in the daytime etc but really you couldn\u2019t as you didn\u2019t know who was on who\u2019s team because the manger couldn\u2019t be bothered to invest in any coloured swimming caps so you were left guessing who was on your side. During our stay Hurricane Rhina was coming so everything was packed away no entertainment was really offered for the kids they really could have put on a film in the theatre for the kids to watch!!!! The evening entertainment was a little better but to be honest we preferred the entertainment at the Riu Tequila for both daytime and evening. Rooms were a bit small but perfectly serviceable for your needs. We had a really nice young man who cleaned our room everyday he did a smashing job he is the one thing this hotel should be proud of, we did tip him heavily at the end of our holiday, Snack Bar food okay here if you like chips pizza burger and hotdogs every day but then it is only a snack bar. Also I had to report an accident here I pick up so tongs for food but they were so hot I had to drop them and run and put in hand in the pool to avoid a nasty burn. Buffet restaurant initially I thought this was great with lots of different choice but again as with all all-inclusive it does become somewhat repetitive pasta burgers fish and pieces of steak. We tried all three a la carte\u2019s I really wouldn\u2019t bother with the Mexican we walked out of this one it was awful, the steak house and Asian are both fabulous. The bars weren\u2019t the best the drinks were particularly weak, If you not prepared to flash notes at the bar tender then be prepared to wait a while as I found loud American folk would just walk up to the bar start flashing the cash and you would be forgotten about. Also if you\u2019re a child and you go to get a coke I found that I would have to go and stand behind my son when he went to get a drink or he would just be ignored. I not adverse to tipping but only once good service have been provided. If you are looking to book this hotel I would look to the Riu Tequila or the Riu Palace the food is a lot better and the day and evening entertainment is better too.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c5* service 5* location 3* building\u201d", "Author": "McLauTrips", "ReviewID": "UR120511813", "Content": "We (young couple) stayed at the Riu Yucatan for two weeks end of Oct - Nov. To summarise; good hotel, great if you get a cheap deal, not luxury hotel and wouldn't pay Thomson platinum prices to stay here due to it needing to be refurbished. In detail; The service we received whilst at the hotel was good. Rooms were cleaned every day! We had extra towels provided so we didn't have to breakdown the towel art we received on our bed, which was on more than a couple of occasions. Reception staff were eager to please as we had a phone call during our stay to ask about the service we had received and in return they left us a gift outside our room. The waiting staff were very good, always asking if we needed extra drinks, and making sure our table was clean. Lots of cocktail choices and there was always cocktail of the day outside the main restaurant. Only bad point was a just one moody bar man at the Tulum bar during the day by the pool, my partner found him unfriendly even when we he tried his best spanish phrases on him, so we used another bar. The entertainment team work hard, we didn't get involved in the day activities but generally watched the evening show. They did bring acts from outside in, some very good (michael jackson) some weren't bad but it's really down to taste, but it's rotated each evening so there is always something on. Food in the main hall is good, lots of choices, I think people who complain about the food here are probably junk food eaters as the burger/chip/unhealthy options are few. Lots of fish, meat, veg, pasta options available. Fruit was so fresh, delicious! We ate in the 3 A la Carte restaurants and thought the food in the main hall was better. I'd be very skeptical about the steak house as myself and my partner pay a lot of money for good steaks and neither of us could eat our meal as it just didn't taste right. We didn't complain at time because the waiting staff we're soo good and friendly. Beach is perfect, beautiful plenty of sun lounges and a stones throw away! So the downside is the decor, mainly in the dining hall and the bedrooms. This needs to be updated to meet the standards of the rest of the hotel. Old carpets chairs and tables in dining hall, then bedrooms old TV's, curtains, bedding and decor, which is a shame really. We booked this late so got a reasonable deal, I would be very disappointed if i'd paid the 4 star Thomson platinum price for this hotel. Word of caution for Thomson bookers, they provide a poor service and really over charge for the trips! Book elsewhere and save your money!

Overall the hotel was great, with much better than expected food (the fish on the buffet was excellent), immaculate grounds and a nice beach.

About halfway through the trip we started noticing that most of the other guests had red and white Riu umbrellas. When I inquired about these, the front desk said they were all out. We were pretty irritated since everyone else but us seemed to know that these were available.

The only area which could be improved is the evening entertainment could be better, but the Riu Tequila is approx. 200 meters away and you can use all their all inclusive facilities. We saw a Moulin Rouge show there, which was very good and other people we spoke to who stayed there said the evening entertainment was excellent every night. (They also have a 24 hour Sports Bar). In the Riu Yucatan grounds, due to the location near to the jungle, there are some wonderful, friendly animals wandering around the grounds.(One looks like a raccoon, one like a giant guinea pig and families of monkeys up in the trees.

We liked eating at the beach restaurant for lunch and they had Mexican tostadas which we ate every day. We were never hungry and looked forward to each and every meal. Breakfast was my favorite! The staff at this resort are the best! Bartenders, waiters, and the animation team all rocked. The shows were really good, especially the Michael Jackson night; that guy has the moves down - really looks like MJ!! All the staff seem genuinely happy to be at work and treat you with respect. Tips are appreciated but not expected. The front desk was very helpful and went above and beyond by helping us with some local phone calls that we had to make.

I am really not a complainer, im just normal, dont have really high standards, I just expect a place to relax, a place to eat, a place to drink, a place to be entertained. I deffinately had a place to relax - the beach is like a stone throw away, and lovely, great sea, sand - only thing is, it would have been better if they had a bar on the beach, but it was like 5 mins walk poolside to get one so its not a huge negative. A place to eat, there was the buffet which was SHOCKING - NO variety, cant believe people put \"plenty of choice\" - really poorly labled up so you guessed what you was eating most of the time, nothing exciting, twice whilst we were there, they had turkey (this was an event) and boy was it awful, it was really bad. Best thing about the buffet was spaghetti, they cooked it to your order - but nothing extreamly imaginitve, just a few herbs and spices - and i'm not kidding, this is the best thing about this buffet. There was another buffet type beach house - next to pool, REALLY limited selection, hotdogs, burgers, pizza, pasta, chips - thats it! Then there was 3 \"a la carte\" restaraunts - steak house - 5 course meal, crap - steak was poor quality - not just mine, I spoke to several (8maybe) other people on different days/nights that had eaten there and said the same. Asian restaraunt - cant comment on the quality of food, if you want to try this you HAVE to be ready in the queue at 6:30am to book for that evening, NO OTHER WAY TO GET A TABLE, not even on my birthday, we were there, we rang reception, we spoke to hotel manager, we couldnt get in there, so i cant comment about food, although heard it was nice. Mexican restaraunt - cant comment, couldnt get in here either, and heard incredibly poor reviews from other people whilst there. I litereally got back today, and October is a quiter time of year, so to not be able to get into these restaraunts in the low season suggests there are not enough tables. Anyway - A place to drink, plenty of bars, like I said, would prefer a beach bar, pool bars were ok, although they wouldnt open at all if it rained early in the morning, regardless that it was sun shining for the rest of the day. Only gripe I have about the bars is that often the drinks tasted really watered down. Beer was ok, and thats it about the bars. Service was 8 our of 10. A place to be entertained - STUPIDLY AWFUL, i mean 0/10. I can't believe how BAD it is, it was AWFUL. For start there is an incredible LACK of entertainment. There must be like 20/30 RIU entertainment staff, and they are shocking, they are so poor it made me laugh, they did a kids show ( well it was \"get the kids on stage for a dancing game\" ) at 9 o'clock at night - this is when the entertainment begins! 9pm, I want to be entertained as an adult, not watch some fool dress up as a \"clown\" and dance round on stage with 2 year olds, (whom might i add were few and far between, just 2 , 3 at the most! Then the adult entertainment - started most nights and nearly 10pm, ( some nights there would be NOTHING before this time, no music, no singer, no games, no NOTHING )! the show's were awful to, they trashed every song they danced to ( they never sing - they just mimmed - BADLY ), every so often - once, maybe twice whilst we were there they hired a singer in - and they were just as bad. just awful, I have never been on holiday and left a bad review (ive been to the far east, america, caribbean, europe - pretty well travelled) and I have never had so many early nights, twice I was out after 10:30, and both those nights we went out of the hotel - seriously that must show you how bad it was. The hotel itself was clean and tidy, well maintained, only problem with it was, when it rained it was really slippy everywhere, we made a joke of it! I wouldnt go to Mexico again after this bad experience, if I did it would be to Cancun ( just for a little bit more variety - playacar is an hour drive away and as a result a lot quieter ) I DEFFINATELY wouldnt stay at RIU anywhere in the world EVER again! out of 10 - I would rate my holiday a 4! If you can change your hotel I really would - I promise I'm not a complainer or a bad reviewer, not really critical and I do always look for the good in everything, but this hotel is bad - 3* at best.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "Norris79", "ReviewID": "UR119158820", "Content": "Hotel was gorgeous, service was excellent, food was great with plenty of choice.

Weather was amazing (+30) with rain only once during the night. As long as the weather cooperates, September is a great time to go. No line-ups or waits for anything including pool & beach chairs but it still busy enough to have a fun time with the other guests at the pool & bars. Buffet was standard Mexican all-inclusive fare and we could always find something to eat. The Steak House - reservations required by 7:30 am \u2013 was just phenomenal! Service was always great and staff at the front desk and throughout the hotel were exceptional. The hotel was a good size and layout. No long hikes to get anywhere. A nice change after staying at some huge resorts in the Mayan. Nice pool. The beach was the jewel of the holiday. Absolutely spectacular! The water was beautiful turquoise and as warm as bath water. The bottom was clear and the waves gentle enough that we did spent hours bobbing around out there. The beach was very clean and the sand soft and white. We walked hours on the beach daily all the way down to Senor Frogs and back. It was perfect! During our stay at the resort the tourists were mainly Canadian, British and some other Europeans. It was a great mix of people that got on well and made for lively conversation at the lobby bar. The evening entertainment was the standard \u201ccheesy\u201d AI dancing / singing show which we have seen many times before. This was not an issue to us as we went into Playa Del Carmen most evenings ($7 cab fare) which was fabulous. It was great fun shopping, people watching, checking out the bars and restaurants and sitting at the many outdoor patios on 5th Ave. There was a carnival atmosphere every night and we just loved it. We went to Coco Bongo\u2019s once which was an awesome evening. I would recommend it to everyone. I was hesitant to go initially thinking it would be more of a younger people\u2019s nightclub \u2013 I am 50 yrs old. So wrong! The clientele ranged in age from 20 to 70 and everyone was having an excellent time! Non-stop entertainment. It\u2019s really impressive and worth seeing! On a final note -It wasn\u2019t an issue to us but I can see that the lack of privacy in the bathroom area of the rooms would be a concern to some people as there is only a curtain separating the bed area from the bathroom.

Everytime I go to Playa Del Carmen, I wanted to stay at this hotel. Because of it's FABULOUS beach, crystal clear water, and approximity to the AWESOME 5th ave, I figured I couldn't go wrong! I was right! HOTEL Hotel is perfect size--not too big and not too small. It is right on the beach and a $7.00 cab ride or 30 minute walk from 5th avenue. It has a beautiful big pool with lots of chairs around it. It has about 5 different bars to go to (lobby bar is the busy one at night), and you can head down to the Riu Tequila if you want to check out there Disco (about 5 minute walk). The rooms are average, but definitely good enough. Who stays in the rooms on holiday anyway?? The staff takes a lot of time to make the resort very clean and all the gardens are maintained and look beautiful. BEACH The beach is absolutely gorgeous and the water is crystal clear! One of the best beaches I have been to! There are PLENTY of chairs, so no need to wake up early to claim one. You can move your chairs as close to the water as you want, and there are also shady spots to choose from. The sand is groomed daily and is very clean. We swam everyday because the water was so warm and there were barely any waves--so great! If you bring out a banana in the ocean and break off little pieces, there will be TONS of fish swimming around you...great for snorkeling! ENTERTAINMENT They have a very nice stage at the Riu Yucatan and the theatre was located outside with open air--nice concept. Typical resort entertainment with bright costumes and lots of dancing. There was always a funny audience participation portion at about 9 pm then the real show would start about 9:30. In the day time there would be entertainment staff around the pool encouraging people to play beach volleyball, darts, bochie ball etc. But if you didn't want too, they didn't push you. They worked very hard and they were very friendly. STAFF The staff was EXCELLENT and would do absolutely everything to please you. The bar tenders were hilarious!! Some even gave me small gifts!They would make great drinks and shots! If you are brave, try the Mexican Flag shot (they light it on fire!!) I had lots of these on vacation. Also another popular one was the tequila popper! The cleaning ladies always made our room spottlessly clean and were always very nice. Everywhere you go everyone says Hola!! The mayan people are some of the nicest people I have ever met. FOOD Food was good; always something new to try. Lots of seafood if you're into that! The pizzas and breads were delcious! They make you personal pasta with your own sauce and veggies to choose from. The Steakhouse (you need reservation) was DELCIOUS! SOOO much food. Don't eat much before you go there, because there is SOO many courses! NIGHTLIFE! GO TO 5TH AVE--SO much fun! TONS of shopping! All the people down there are super funny and nice. It's better to go down there with a few drinks in you--makes it much more fun! COCO BONGO is a MUST! It is the coolest place I have ever been too. Costs about $50.00 and you get free drinks all night. Just tip your waiter and he will be back to serve you constantly. It is a mix between a FAB vegas show and a night club. It's for all ages! 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s etc. EVERYBODY will like it! Not just for young people! Summary--I had a great time at the Riu Yucatan. I would reccommend it to my family and friends and would defs go back!

The room we stayed in was comfortable although a slight upgrade as in a \"coded password\" for the safe and a \"swipe card\" for the door to get in would be better than that of the use of \"keys\". Also because I like a cup of tea when I get up then I think a tea/coffee making facilities in the room would make it better. The cleanliness was 1st class and we loved the \"toweling models\" which they did as we returned to our room at the end of the day. The wild life was amazing and we did see the monkey in the tree. Don't be put of the birds flying around in the beach area restaurant as they are really entertaining. You just got to remember you are in the jungle. We used the pool and took part in the activities during the day. The \"Entertainment Team\" were one of the best I have ever seen, and the shows in the evening were great. The key is though participation of the holiday makers. Everyone that I know who we spoke to absolutely loved the place. We also used the beach and that was amazing. The sea was clear and the fishes we spectacular especially if someone took bread into the sea to feed them. I recommend you take a snorkle with you also. The food was good and a wide choice to choose from, also we tried all the restaurants which I liked the steak restaurant the best. We had a few tropical rain showers on a few days and evenings, but it was a welcome relief and it didn't last long so don't be put off at this time of the year. The temp was in it's 30's and all have fab tans by the end. The humidity on average was about 70%, but you soon got use to it and keep the aircon in your room at all times as it is so refreshing at the end of the day. Only downside if I was \"picky\" would be the \"mossies\", I think I had about 1/2 doz or so but if you take \"mossie\" spray and repellent you will be fine. We had a few trips out with the Captain Hook evening being excellent. It is well worth listening to the Thomson rep and by the way she loves \"marmite\" and \"english chocolate\" so take her some if you go.

When we arrived at the hotel, eveything was very well organised and check-in was really easy. The hotel was gorgeous and the staff were extra friendly! They would bend over backwards to help you! Before we went we read a few reviews on here and we noticed a lot said you needed to get up early to get a sun lounger....? We had no problems at all, we got loungers every day and didnt have to set our alarm in order to do so! I do, however, understand where people are coming from when they said the variety of food wasnt too good. Dont get me wrong, the food was lovely but they only really changed 1 or 2 dishes each night, the rest was repeated each night. The Steak House is a definate reccommendation though, the food there was really good! The only other things i would reccommend to people is just take American dollers to spend whilst your there. We took half dollars, half Pesos, but realised once our dollars had gone it worked out a bit cheaper to use those rather than pesos. The other thing would be MOSQUITOS!!!! We took 2 different kinds of repellant and none of these worked. My husband had around 20+ bites on his legs and then after about a week they seemed to move onto me and i had about 15! It didnt ruin our holiday but no-one likes being bitten and with so many the itching can get quite annoying! Since we've been back we we've been told to use extra strong repellant so might be an idea to invest in some before going to Mexico! We would definately go back here as the place is stunning, the weather is fab and overall we had an amazing time!

It reasures you somehow... - not so great with the a la carte options...but believe it or not, the buffet was more than OK - hotel: clean and they're really working like crazy to keep it like this - some reviews mentioned it's outdated, I don't think so, it was buit in '98, it's the hacienda stye that looks different.

There were a lot of english people before but they where OK, noisy a bit and getting drank fast but still OK. Well, in our last day, the hotel got completely populated, I guess some of them where really from remote areas from England...it was such a view.

Never say never if the price was right. Rooms were tired but clean, sheets and towels changed daily. We stayed on 3rd floor as didn't want to be on the ground. Mini bar stocked every other day as promised. Beds were hard but that suited us. Bars, not all open, we don't drink alcohol in the day so was ok as soft drinks can be self dispensed. As the day went on the pool bars became a bit dirty, we opted for the beach as pools are too busy for us. Make sure you ask for branded drinks - ask for Gordons & Tonic rather than Gin & Tonic or you will get the locally produced stuff. Beer great and wine ok. Gets really loud and lots of smokers so we didn't spend a lot of time there. Food, Buffet restaurant the better out of the 4, the 'a la carte' steakhouse and Mexican were the same restaurants where you had lunch and snacks - they put a tablecloth on the table and as if by magic they became 'a a carte'!!!! Steakhouse was truly awful, the beef was the worst quality I have ever tasted. We couldn't eat ours and left it, we complained to one of the managers but it was a waste of time! He just avoided me for the rest of the holiday! We opted to go into Playa Del Carmen to eat as the food here was amazing - my review on Sur Steakhouse will follow! Best steak I have eaten! At the end of the day the food at the Yucatan is not free - we have paid for all inclusive, doubt if they could get away with it if it wasn't all inclusive. Standards have definitely slipped in the 5 years since I last visited the hotel - the nachos etc were not out of a packet! Beach, beautiful sand, quieter than the pool, no problems getting sun beds. The only issue was the amount of cigarette buts everywhere, it made me feel ill on times! Now I know thats not the hotels fault as the filthy people who drop them wherever they sit but they have no options - maybe the hotel should supply ashtrays to the beach area. Entertainment, very 'butlins' but the few nights we stayed in instead of going to town we enjoyed the show. The entertainment staff work so hard! It's all very professional. Staff, all the staff were amazing, nothing too much trouble, apart from the manager not dealing with my complaint very well, I couldn't fault anyone working at the hotel Gym, well equipt, small but has everything to enable you to have a good workout.

It still, however, cost us \u00a36,000 with First Choice Holidays. When we first arrived it was before the Summer holidays had started and the hotel was busy but not packed. The food was lovely, there were games, sweets, candy floss etc in the lobby at dinner time which our daughters loved. The Entertainment was also very good with entertainment before (in the lobby) and after dinner. All of the above ended on the 3rd/4th day of our vacation. We went to the usual package holiday welcome meeting with First Choice's representative, Emma. All she went on and on about for 40 minutes was their trips to various places. They were very expensive. We enjoyed the first 3 days of our holiday then our nice vacation began to turn in to a nightmare. There are a number of Riu hotels within the same area. Only 2/3 have a beach fronts (Yucatan being one of them) . My husband started having to get up at 5-5.30 am to put towels on sunbeds. A lot of the beds had already gone by the time he arrived. The problem was residents from their other hotels, especially with no beach, were taking the beds and using the facilities. This meant the hotel was beyond bursting point most days. When the hotel became packed to capacity the food also went very quickly downhill. Each lunch time at the restaurants was the same for 14 days. Burgers, hotdogs, pizza, spaghetti. 7 am each morning you have to queue at the buffet restaurant if you want to eat at a restaurant other than the Buffet. They have Mexican (same 2 choices each night), Asia (people, including us, walked out due to poor food) and the Steak House, which once again was the same few choices on the menu. The Entertainment was very repetitive. We had different shows for the first few days then it was the same over and over again. My daughter's (aged 11) also asked not to go out a few evenings as they were bored. I would, however, like to say that the Entertainment staff were amazing especially Nadia who worked at the kids club and during the evening entertainment. The Riu Yucatan also issue day/weekend passes to Mexicans so the hotel gets even busier with both pools and pool bars burtsing at the seams. We went to 5th Avenue where all the shops, bars etc are. This is the most expensive shopping mall/area I have ever been to and my family & I lived in the Middle East for 12 years. Kids bracelets (cotton/plastic) $30 US, very small leather bag for little girls $40 US, Postcards 55 - 100 Pesos (we got 16 to the pound) etc etc. There was a small shopping mall not far from the Riu Yucatan (within walking distance) that is far cheaper than 5th Avenue. I would not recommend this hotel but if you decided you did want to visit I would suggest outside of school holidays. We met people who also stated the same as the over crowding of the hotel and its facilities was too much. The hotel/brochure also states they have WiFi. They do!! but you can only get it in one very small area out side the Buffet Dining room. This hotel is also NOT Disabled accessible. Wheelchair users would get around but they would struggle a great deal. I am a wheelchair user. On a positive note the rooms were always cleaned daily but we had to phone every couple of days to have the fridge re-stocked with water, soft drinks etc. There are also no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. You would also struggle with more than 2 children. They will supply camp beds but there is no available room within the bedroom. The beds are American Queen so I would say just smaller than our Double beds.

We had a fantastic time. First the negatives As many people have said, the beds are ROCK HARD. The resort was full of Europeans, so there was smoking almost everywhere (except in the main dining room, specialty restaurants). a suggestion would be to ban it in the pool area and lobby. The door key system sucks. It would be nice to have your bands open the door, not the single key that you get. Locked myself out a few times. These really are minor things as everything else was fantastic. The beach area is great. It really is a beautiful beach. Rooms were fine (not in them that much). The grounds were beautiful with some wildlife around. The entertainment and animation was excellent. The food was excellent. The buffet provided plenty of variety every day and I never tired of it. I loved the fresh fruit in the morning, as well as the available pasta station at lunch and dinner. My kids loved the available fresh pizza at lunch and dinner. There were themed dinners each evening as well. The Oriental Restaurant was okay and the steak restaurant was superb. Can't beat the location. Very close to Playa del Carmen as well as a nice shopping plaza a 5 minute walk away. The best part of the whole trip and what made it very enjoyable was the staff. THEY WERE SUPERB AND FRIENDLY, from our room cleaner to the wait staff, to the bartenders. They really made the trip. I wish I could have tipped them all. Special mention to Filaberto at the pool bar (hilarious), Leo in the dining room and Naomi at the Lobby Bar. There were two other bartenders whose name I can't remember (at lobby and Stage Bar) who were great as well as all of our waite staff. They all work really hard.

However, i really feel it necessary to do these reviews because like you i depend on them for information and downright the real low down on where i want to go so, here it goes. THE LOCATION: The location of this hotel is in a gated community of playacar. Even the cab drivers have to give up there id's to drop you off and they check every single vehicle coming into playacar. If im correct there are 3 other Riu's located in the same area and you can visit them with the exception of Riu Palace (which i could have kicked myself for not booking) it was an amazing facility from what i saw and everyone who stayed there loved it... fyi. I felt safe the whole time i was there. THE FOOD: The main dining area which is set up as buffet was pretty decent. Nothing out of ordinary and everything looked fresh and servers where all wonderful and very polite.You are always greeted with smile and good morning. The best specialty restaurant is the steak house which is located overlooking the beach. Very good steak, my boyfriend and i went there twice and only because we wanted to really have a treat. The asian was ok - definitely didn't taste authentic and i love chinese food and i grew up living two blocks for china town in nyc so i would know the difference. Not the worse but definitely not the best. I didnt try the mexican because they had it at the buffet and i didnt want 'gormet' mexican, so we skipped it. By the way, i didnt get sick at all. THE DRINKS: I'm a vodka drinker and i only like to drink top shelf, unfortunately they had stoli which is the bottom of the barrel as far as im concerned. I stuck to tequila which was cuervo, they didnt have too many top shelf options but they can make a mean drink. THE SHOW: I got say, the shows were pretty good. I was surprised at the quality of the performance considering where we were. They really go out to put on a decent show and they did. I wasnt disappointed and hey it was something to do : ) Now for the part that was very disappointing: THE ROOMS: The rooms were outdated, rusty fixtures, stained sheets, minimal toiletries, and yes the bed is hard but after a long day at excursion or laying in blazing sun you can care less but you will notice. I dont think i have to go further, i went there with an open mind i figured there was a slight possiblity that someone was exagerating but no my fellow travelers it is what its- the place needs to be renovated and you barely get the bare necessities. THE BEACH: Was absoultey amazing - however i wish they would have more palm trees or umbrellas or something - the sun is intense and the palm trees available are far from the water so you have to walk a couple feet and also i notice next door at Riu Palace they're were waiters giving out drinks but not for us... it would be nice to have the same service but like i said you get what pay for and at Yucatan you get the basics. I would say in nutshell, i would not refer anyone to this hotel and ofcourse i would defintely not return. It's a shame because the employees here are wonderful and very hardworking which made it bearable to stay at this hotel. This hotel should not be considred 3 or 4 stars at all. It is very basic, it is clean i do want to mention that , the grounds are very well kept and food area was constantly cleaned.

I wrote to the hotel in advance to say we were coming for our third visit, and they gave my daughter and I a free upgrade to a suite. This was wonderfully spacious and well designed, and also included the standard mini-bar and optics which were kept well stocked according to our preferences. The strongest features of this hotel are the friendliness of the staff and the cleanliness of the whole hotel and its grounds. The Riu Yucatan is positioned right on the beach, which is idylic white sand and turquoise clear sea. There are two pools which are well maintained and plenty of sun loungers around the pools and on the beach. As with most all-inclusives, the food is very similar each day, but there is a great range of food on the buffets. The breakfast buffet is large and varied, with everything from freshly cooked pancakes and omelettes to mexican specilities and wonderful fresh fruit and smoothies. The bread is made on the premises for all the neighbouring Riu hotels and was very good. We always took lunch either at the restaurant by the swimming pools or at the beach club. At both loctions there was plenty of salad, pizza, burgers, chips and desserts vailable. The evening buffet was also very well stocked, and the freshly cooked pasta station was our favourite destination. We also used the speciality restaurants -Mexican and Asian - which were a nice change to the main buffet restaurant. As vegetarians we didn't try the steak house, but other people told us this was good. The animation team were friendly and enthusiastic, but never tried to force people into any of the activites. Sometimes it was a nuisance when the music started at 10 am, but you can easily disappear to the beach for peace and quiet. However, the activities were always good humoured and I really had fun watching some of the activities taking place. I also enjoyed the aqua aerobics (helps to balance out the food and drink excesses!) and afternoon dance classes. There are a lot of great excursions in this area, so I would thoroughly recommending getting out and seeing something of Mexico. My favourites were Tulum, Coba, and Chichen Itza for Mayan ruins, Xcarat and Xel-Ha for eco-parks with wonderful snorkelling, and a vist to a Cenote is not to be missed. We also swam with the dolphins which was magical.

I looked every week on trip advisor for 6 months on this hotel as i had never done all inclusive in case of not liking such things as the food, plus i like to get out and about. After reading some of the reviews i obviously had my concerns and werent sure what to expect but when i arrived it completly took me back. Yes i can see why the moaners on here say its not 5 star and they have stayed in much better but i can only imagine these are snobs as they make it out to be worse than it is but yes i was invited to the riu palace for dinner one evening and it completly made yucatan look 4 star some would even say 3 star but i am a veey laid back person and even said i was glad i picked yucatan over the palace because it was to posh for me and when having dinner there i felt out of place as it was filled with rich snobs that looked down there noses at you even though i was polite and took it all in you could see there was no atmosphere. I spent some time over the Tequila to watch the football in the sports bar and even admitted the grounds where maintained better but felt felt we had made the right choice for the simple reason of being right on the beach. I myself am not a beach person but i spent more time on the beach than anywhere as it was completly breath taking, i have never seen a beach like it, it was so clean and the water crystal clear with pipe fish, tropical fish and barricuda's all swimming round us. Unless you want to do trips or such things as jet ski's, paragliding, diving or fishing trips you literally need no cash. You can simply down to the watersports hut and hire canoe's kyacks snorkels flippers and goggles all for free of charge as many times as you like. We felt you didnt need to pay for diving trip as there is a reef 10 mins walk up the beach and the was plenty of fish to see there. I have never been anywhere so hot it was reaching 34 degrees by 9:30am and 44 by 2pm. I always needed a small towel from the room to use as a sweat towel but only once did the towel hut run out but this is due to the fact so many people dont hand there towels in the night before and give them in the next day and automatically ask for clean ones which means they end up with loads of dirty towels and no clean ones to hand out. ( customer fault in my eyes ). Yes there was a slight smell of sewer not far from the pool but it was only when you walked past it hit you for a breif second but it certainly werent all over the hotel like some say. There also is not loads of noise from the lounge bar like its said, people we made friends with were in a room Not far from it and unless you slept on the balcony you would never hear a thing. All the staff worked extremly hard and for those of you that winge you have it hard in this country at work, go here then tell me you have a right to moan. They 1 day off a week and the hotel is open all year round they also start at 8am and finish at 12am some much later. The entertainment team work hard and keep you occupied all day if you want to join in but you are not forced to and the dancers are on stage all day practising for the evening show so how dare any1 say its differant cause they work 10x harder than any of us earn a fraction of what we all earn and do it in extreme heat. Not once did any if them even look to hint that they were tired or miserable and every day they would walk round the pool to greet you all and say hi. Yes the pool was hot and not really refreshing but the cold showers always helped. It did also look a little unclean by the end of the day but when you have over 1000 people in the hotel and there either jumping straight into the pool with loads of suncream on or walking in off the beach caked in sand and going straight in without showering 1st its to be expected but it was cleaned during the night. The main moans i always see on here was the food being the same.... What rubbish. I normally go self catering in greece most of the time because i always think if i dont like the food then im knackered plus i like to try differant things in restaurants. Normally by the end of the 2 weeks im bored of it but not once did i have enough of it. The 1st day i got there i went into the buffet to see if it was true and there was 8 differant meals i would of ate that night. Yes you always had your pasta bar and pizza bar but the show cookin always did something differant. The only one that was the same was the steak house at lunch time which was salad's burgers pizza rice etc but it was simply for those that didnt want to sit in the buffet restaurant. So unless your a fussy eater you will be fine. For any one who moans about the rooms, it may just be me but get a life. Its a bed and a shower so if your on holiday to sit in your room and admire it stay at home. Telly is for home, the beds are not hard and moaning about a fridge with not much choice, i'm a drinker and yet i only had 3 beers out of it plus all water. It was on tap 24 hours a day from the bar so its not as if it was needed. I only ate at the steak house as i was more than happy to eat from the buffet plus i could do it when i wanted whereas the pre book ones had sitting times ( 18:45- to early and 20:45- to late ). If your with thompson or First Choice then Tessa Bishop will be one of your rep's and she is probably the best rep i have had in any country, she is fully committed to her job and nothing is to much trouble. My partner fell down the stairs and she sorted it instantly we also had trouble with getting money out from our bank so she arranged for us to transfer money over to them and she gave me cash plus we went to xelha and due to finding we couldn't get cash and we wanted the photo's from the day out she arranged with xelha to let them have them the next day when we had cash and she even drove an hour up the road to give them to us the next day. The aircon is great it is everywhere, i never had trouble sleeping and eating. Overall the trip was amazing and i would go back tomorrow, but if you like it posh then this place is not for you. This is a laid back person's holiday.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAmazing!!!

This was our second visit to Mexico having stayed at the Riu Cancun on our earlier visit. Personal preference is the Riu Cancun, but that was to do with where the Hotel is situated and nothing else. The Yucatan is a large friendly hotel with absolutely fabulous beaches and the weather was fantastic. Because of how the hotel is built no rooms have sea views but we were lucky enough to have a room two minutes from pool area and less than 5 minutes to the beach. We spent most of the holiday on the beach where there is plenty of sunbeds but not much shade. If you like shade you have to place the beds between Palm Trees, but the breeze from the sea always meant you never got too hot. My son and daughter did the trip to swim with the Whale sharks and my son would highly this excursion. He came back with a DVD and it has been looked at sevral times since we arrived home. The trip is quite expensive costing about \u00a3148.00 each on the day my children took part. As a family we visited Tulum and Akumal, where we got to swim with the turtles. Tulum is a lovely area if you enjoy looking at Mayan culture and the views are excellent. On my earlier visit, in 2008, I visited Chichen Itza, which I thoroughly enjoyed and would also recommend. On this trip you get the chance to swim in a CENOTE which was also a new experince. However Chichen Itza covers a vast site and it is very exposed to the harsh sun, It is very hot and tiring but mainly because you leave the Hotel so early in the morning to arrive at a decent time to access the site before temperatures are too unbearable. We stopped off at Ziggy Beach for lunch which was very enjoyable. This beach once again was fabulous but the waves were high and the tide quite strong so be careful if you venture out into the water at this spot. There is also moutains of seaweed which the locals dig a big hole in the sand for and then bury out of sight. After two hours spent at Ziggy Beach we travelled on to Akumal itself and put all of the correct snorkelling equipment on to go into the sea and look for turtles. The guides kept most people in the sea for about 50 minutes but 30 minutes was more than enough for myself as we had to swim out quite some distance in our quest to find turtles, which we did find along with some sting rays and various species of fish, and there is also a lot of sea grass in quite shallow waters. You are offered the chance to purchase DVD's of your experience and the Whale Shark DVD cost 540 pesos - about \u00a327.00, while Akumal cost just 300 pesos which is excellent value. Animation team at the Hotel do a great job and all members of staff worked extremely long hours and seems to be on duty at all times. Night time shows were repetitive - Michael Jackson tribute, Abba, Mexican, Karaoke - not our scene but always packed. Queues at the bar for drinks could be quite long depending on what time of day or night you were wanting a drink but staff always knew whose turn is was next no matter how many people were waiting to be served. The Steak House and Asian Restuarants can be booked at no extra charge and we went to both of these twice and another a option of MEXICAN if you so wish is also available. Food at the restaurants we chose offer a good choice if you want to try something different and the Asian Restuarant did Fried Ice Cream which my son informed me was delightful!!! Looked good but a step too far for my taste buds. English people are in the majority at this Hotel with MEXICAN, DUTCH, CANADIAN, AMERICAN and then a few GERMAN, FRENCH and even people from CHILE. A constant question asked by members of staff was 'Who was left in ENGLAND if we were all there'? There are not many shops in the vicinity of the hotel and what shops are available can be quite expensive. A taxi ride to Fifth Avenue approx 10 minutes cost 70 pesos where there are lots and lots of shops to choose from, and items on sale were sometimes less than a third of the price (at Playacar) for the exact same product or something even smaller in size. Be prepared to barter if you really want to buy something - our REP informed us you can save un to 40% on some things if you haggle. Also because of where the Hotel is situated there is a lot of animals around the accomodation, including monkeys - we saw 2 while staying - lizards, peacocks, variety of other birds and an animal which the MEXICAN liken to a squirrel but various people including myself thought more like a large rat or possibly small pig. There is a large numer of these and we saw several during our stay. My son also accessed the Gym every day which he said was quitre well equipped. The management often made the effort to speak to guest on a daily basis and also thank everyone - at the pool -once a week when new guests arrived. On the whole a great time was had by everyone of us and we would recoomend this Hotel, more so if you want to be somewhere which is more secluded and you dont mind being in the middle of what at times feel like a JUNGLE.

If you do go be careful around the Jacuzzi bar as I did not see many people going to the toilet, make your own deduction from that. If this is a 4 star hotel I will eat my flip flops, this has never seen 4 stars and almost feels like a little bit of Benidorm in Mexico. When I contacted Thomson about my concerns they said sorry but that was it. I explained this was a Platinum hotel as per the website and I expected more. The reply was that this is achieved by all of the positive reviews, so I thought to put my own on to reflect my experience.

The room was lovely and clean and the maids were in everyday to clean it, we left a 2 doller tip everyday for the girls and when we came back from the beach we had a different towel design, ranging from monkeys, dolls, elephants etc which our daughter loved. If their was just one fault in the blocks it was other people not respecting others and slamming the heavy fire doors no matter what time of day or night it was and because the rooms are so big this noise echoed. The location was very good as we were situated right on the beach. the entertainment staff work so hard they are at the pool side from 10am fight through till 11 pm, they are fab.

One tip is when leaving and getting to mexico airport, when checking in your case it is not to exceed 25kg, this is where we messed up as we had an allowance of 69kg for 3 of us, we took 2 cases between us, checking into Bristol was fine, but in mexico we were under our allowance but over the stated weight for one case, so we had to open up the cases and repack into rucksacks we had, next time we will have 3 cases per person!

I was very disappointed with this resort. First, I will start with the positive, which are not so many. Having been in Riu resorts 3 other times before, I was surprisingly shocked to see that the quality of the Riu's hotels was poor. The food was far from being great, but it was good. I will talk more about the food in the negative points. The waiters were really nice. They remembered you by drinks you take, places you like to seat, etc, and it\u2019s really sweet. We gave our waiter a generous tip at the end of our stay. The beach was beautiful and the water as well. It was crystal clear. It was definitely one of the most beautiful beach I\u2019ve seen. You can also do a long beach walk. The drinks we\u2019re good. Most of the times you need to ask for more alcohol in your drinks because they are cheap on it, but the selection was excellent and the bartenders we\u2019re friendly. Sadly, those were the only good points about this resort. The rooms weren\u2019t beautiful. It was a colonial style, perhaps it wasn\u2019t nice. There was a lot of dirt on the walls and some things in the room were broken. The beds were horrible, they were so hard. For a 5 star hotel, the least we could expect is a card for the room. But no, it was a key. I\u2019ve never seen a key at a hotel and I\u2019ve been traveling for my whole life, over 15 hotels\u2026 The pool was clean. Perhaps, there were so many people out there you didn\u2019t have the chance to have a chair if you didn\u2019t go get you\u2019re chair at 7 am. The pool was surrounded by a lot of trees- which was actually not pretty at all. The buffet was the same every day and lacked of variety \u2013 terribly disappointed. The wine was terrible. Of the three reservation restaurants, there was only one that was not a buffet. There was no fine dinning. The entertainment was really poor and the entertainers didn\u2019t do a good job to keep the guest occupied. I\u2019m a teenager and I love to have some fun. There was nothing fun to do at this hotel \u2013 nothing at all. Not recommended for teenagers \u2013 that\u2019s for sure! To have some fun, the people I was with and I went to Coco Bongo \u2013 which you definitely need to go if you are in Mexico. It\u2019s a great experience- even if you\u2019re an adult! It\u2019s amazing. We also went on the fifth avenue in Playa Del Carmen, which was where the action was. The front desk staff was incredibly rude. They think that since from Canada that we have money all over the place. They do not care if we have complains, it seems like they don\u2019t enjoy they\u2019re job and they are mean to the guest \u2013 I\u2019m speaking from personal experience but I\u2019ve talk to other guest and they think the same as me. They treat us like we don\u2019t belong to there hotel and it\u2019s uncomfortable. In conclusion, I will never return to any Riu at all, and never will I return to Mexico. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. The Riu Yucatan was the worst hotel I\u2019ve stayed in and it ruined my vacation. NEVER AGAIN!

It is in pretty good condition considering the numbers of guests from year to year. It has a few flaws with paint peel spots that were not quite repaired as well as they could have been or should have been and some re-texturing flaws that would catch a trained eye from time to time on exterior walls. Standard flaws and not the end of the world by any means. FRONT DESK check in. A young man named Herman checked us in. He later told us that he was leaving employment to return to school to complete his degree in civil engineering. They say your first impression is at the front desk. Herman was SUPER. He was courteous, he was very helpful, and he was very fast at getting us checked in. As can happen at any hotel, we had a couple of issues in our junior suite. Herman was very quick to respond and to follow up with us... Thank YOU, Herman and we wish you success and joy for your future. HOTEL GROUNDS: Very nice well kept. 5 stars out of a possible 5 rating Beach: Super nice. 5 stars STAFF: 5 stars. Everyone was kind and helpful, from the maids cleaning down to the kitchen staff. Everyone employee who we walked by, would speak to us and smile. SPECIALITY RESTAURANTS:: Excellent effort at the steak house and the Mexican restaurant where we ate. Very good!! Our 3 teenage daughters ate at the Asian restaurant. They gave it only 2 stars..Saying it was not good at all. MAIN DINING BUFFET: One of the (best) we have eaten at. This very large dining hall was nice and cool which is always a great start on a HOT day in August. The food was better than average. The variations were nice. The beverage options and the way the entire lay out of food was set up works very well. Outdoor buffet dining area: Again very nice...good food...good service..nuff said. ROOM QUALITY: Nice for a property of this age. Old style TVs' but honestly we did not turn them on for more than one hour a day at the most. No big deal.. Furniture in rooms: Dated........but nice enough. BEDS: Too firm...is a nice way of putting it. If your 18 you may not care. If you older than 30, then you probably care. Thanks again Herman at the front desk. We gave him a call and within hours the staff had put down a foam pad on our king bed which helped (enough). Not perfect but an improvement for sure.! Our building paralled the cart path used by Riu Tequila for their guests to walk back and forth to the beach. That hotel also provides an old shuttle of sorts. Sad for us becasue the old shuttle they used seemed to operate with something that sounds like an old lawn mower engine without a muffler on it. Hence we had to listen to the sounds of a loud cart going back and forth 40 plus times a day within about 50 feet of our room. This was annoying more than it was a problem. Again, I am just giving you readers information. DRINKS: Very good with sufficient alcohol to get a little buzz. Not full strength, of course, but better than some other hotels we have stayed at. The beer is of course the best! Dos Equis...is on tap everywhere. GREAT !! Alcohol in rooms: Nice to say the least.. Watered down...but still good. Additional beverages in the room. was great...Pepsi, orange, water, seven up...SUPER...Thanks RIU..!! The frig did not get anything COLD per say,,,but it was still nice to have them at no cost... Ice machines in buildings: The ice machine in our building was always empty for our entire stay. I think it was broke. I had to walk to 4 other buildings to find ice for our ice bucket. Not the end of the world by any means, but a little frustrating. Mosquitoes: Everywhere around and in our buidling....!!! We fought mosquitoes from time to time after we checked in. Maybe it was our building location? Our daughters stayed in another building closer to the pool and beach. They did not have a problem. We had to have our room sprayed a few times while at the hotel. Bug spray is something that I do not want to be around or inhale ruminants of.. Not the hotels fault by any means.. Just giving readers, the information. SWIMMING POOLS: The pools are a bit smaller than they appear in photos. If the resort is more than 60% full, then the pools suddenly get too small. Also the water temperature in the pools during our August stay was honestly too HOT! By around 11 in the morning, pool temps were felt more like hot tub water.. We have to rate that part of our stay TWO stars only. Thank goodness for the beach and the beautiful cooler... ocean waters on this aspect. Pool side activiites and beach side activies: The hotel mounted a 2 feet wide by 3 feet tall speaker approximently 60 feet from the pool. The activity guy would use a wireless mic,, to conduct the pool games. The big problem was as follows. Why would you mount a gigantic speaker 60 feet away from the pool? Their would be up to 200 plus guests spread out around the two pools trying to sleep or read or enjoy some shade. Also another few (hunderd) guests lke us were down on the beach which is only another 60 feet away. Point being, You would see 20 or so guests participating in pool games, yet the other 600 guests around the pool or on the beach, are forced to endure the DJ screaming instructions for pools games for what seemed to last for hours each day. I would suggest to RIU management to cut down to a much smaller speaker system and mount it on a tripod 10 feet from the pool and turn down the volume!!! The same problem occured on the beach. They had a large speaker mounted up under the palm trees while the water games were 60 feet or more away in the water...Duuuuuuu.. Why should the majority of guests be forced to endure the screaming of some guy on a mic,..for maybe 20 to 30 guests who decide to participate in games. Not smart at all. SHOWS: First the good. The show performers work very hard to put on nightly shows. We were embarrassed at times that so many people that attuned the outdoor shows were more interested in talking...continuously and standing up and smoking and doing all the things that parents TRY to teach their kids NOT to do at a show.!!! What is the point of going to a show if you are NOT going to sit and pay attention? What are we teaching the kids who are at these shows? End of sermon....sorry. Based on all the different all inclusive hotel shows we have seen, we can rate the shows at a 3 star. Not the best, but tons of heart and effort by the staff and certainly not the worst we have sat through. SMOKING: We have stayed at a couple of properties in past years in which the hotel prohibited smokers on the beach! This was NOT the case at Riu. It is very sad to see a modest number of Europeans guests using the beautiful sandy beaches to as an butt can and leaving butts in the sand. LIFE GUARDS: Some hotel properties use a life guards employees to walk the beach back and forth to help guests and to stop a few obvious indiscretions that can occur from time to time on a beach with too much alcohol. This was NOT the case with RIU. Of the 5 days we were at the hotel, we saw one guy on one day wondering around for about one hour of the day with a rescue shirt and floatation wrap like life guards use. It is not my intent to pick the resort apart. However if you spend your hard earned money on a all inclusive resort. You should have good information before you decide to stay there. We agreed as a family that we had a good time at Riu Yucatan if you can book rooms at the right price over the normal stated room rates! RIU TEQUILA- footnote: we walked the one block down to look at the Tequila property. I am not sure why it gets such high scores. We only walked through the property. We did not ask to see rooms per say. There are only 2 modest size pools,,lots of trees...and the beach is a good 5 minute walk one way. We walked away saying we had a better location at Riu Yucatan versus Riu Tequila. They do however have a night club! Riu Yucatan does not. if that makes a difference for you and your family.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cfriendly, cozy, and fun\u201d", "Author": "zushmoo", "ReviewID": "UR116995626", "Content": "I went on a trip with my parents here in May.

Last year we had been to Riu Caribe , everything there was excellent. We thought 5 star again, Riu hotel meant same quality. Nothing futher than reality. Our rating for the Hotel Riu Yucatan would be 3 star. Is apartment -hotel. Lobby is a great big area at the hotel, were there are shops and bars, nice sitting areas. But you could not stay there for longnas there was no Air conditioning at all, except the fans that were roatating but wasnt making any breeze come at all, the only air conditioning that worked was either in your room or in the Restaurant at meal times. Majority of rooms were not an ocean view. You cannot decide on whether you can have a ocean view room or not , but lets say you do have a decicion. If you then get an ocean view room all you will get is noise day and night due to loud amplifing shows and loud people by the pool. Bringing a positive note to break despite the dissappointing summer holidays, the staff and domestics are very helpful and kind. They work very hard and possibly was the only good thing I could comment about. The cleaning of the rooms is very good, but matresses are old and hard as the rest of rotten furniture. I do not think it is ideal to have bathroom seprated by two curtains only. There is only a shower dish , that normally doesn't drain well so you can imagine the mess of the sand off the beach, when you come back to have a refreshing shower. Also the drinks of fridge are only replaced every 48 hrs if they remember to refill the fridge, I recall having to call reception several times and when that didnt work I had to go down to reception three times for them to fill the fridge, in a matter of three days it took to fill the fridge. The location is surrounded by this gardens that look very nice but all area smells like \"sewers\". However the pools are quite small the have chemicals in them and after a week of being there my oldest daughter got an ear infection along with the other friends she made.If you like to have a warm bath there you will not be satisfied as you do not have one in your room. The pool-bar area's are crowded and quite enclosed so water there looks like broth and is no transparent by no means it smells and looks dirty , so much that we never had a drink there. The beach is very nice and water is excellent but unless you can get a lounge under a shade , you can only go in and out , make sure you go with a pedometer. On the pool area the only toilets are near the theater and another in a food place however you cant go in there wet after you have been in the pool . Again the restaurant near the pool where food is there for you from 10:30 am till 5:00pm only disposes of fans no air conditioning , you will share the place with a lot of black birds that will try to steal your food, sqeak in your ear and falp about all over the place, this is the steak -house restaurant at night. To be honest we were not impressed and we sweat all through the meal that we reserved there . The food was not good quality as in Riu Caribe , very repetitive and leftovers presented next day in a different way , people then was generally queing only for pasta or pizza and fries. The shows and entertainment where absolutely boring and tedious, and if you are not enjoying having drinks at night like me, after supper you felt more happy in your room , the only place you could feel fresh either reading a book or watching TV. It was something that caught my husband attention as he enjoys a good glass of wine with food. The two days after arrival they giving you a quite decent white bottled wine , then you are presented with a from to appraise hotel. After that no more bottled wine , and the one by the glass was discusting. Also rememeber to go with loads of stuff for mosquito bites , as the place is loaded with them. I was lucky but my husband and two daughters got such blisters and bad rashes the chemist charged antibiotic and hydrocortisone cream was about 100 pounds in total. So, no we dont really feel we would either recommend this place to anyone of our friends or going back, there at all.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hatfield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAmazing..Fantastic..Brilliant!\u201d", "Author": "Janet F", "ReviewID": "UR116648987", "Content": "Just got back from Riu Yucatan in Playacar, went on 28th July for 14 nights and wish we had gone for longer!

Alex was so funny we loved him so much, made us laugh every day, such a nice person. The kids club entertainer Nadia was lovely too, my son loved the mini disco in the evening and games, he won 15 prizes throughout the stay! The food is great, lots of choices and my fussy son always found something he liked to eat. Loved the Asian restaurant, the baked ice cream was yummy!! So much to do if you want to, not forced but can play many activities through the day, we done horseshoes, boche, table tennis, football, waterpolo, aerobics, rifle shooting and bingo... The room was really nice, kept very clean and a towel animal left each day. We celebrated our 12th wedding anniversary there and on the day we had put our cards up on the side, when we got back to our room the cleaner had put 2 swan towels in the shape of a heart, made the curtains look so nice and left a big bowl of fruit, streamers hanging off bed and pillows...such a nice touch!! We went to swim with the dolphins...such a fantastic experience..expensive but worth it! Loved the animals that roam around the hotel, saw loads of iguana's, gecko's and lizards which we adore, took so many photo's. The beach is so beautiful, miles of sand and lovely blue sea which was so warm...just paradise! This is our second time at this hotel and will now start to save to go again next year.

We loved the Playacar area so much we went back to the Riu Palace Riveira Maya in April 2011 for 2 weeks and we visited the other Rius including the Riu Yucatan again. This review compares the 2 hotels. Firstly cost. We paid 50% more for the Palace stay so as you would expect the Palace was better than the Yucatan in most ways. The question is was it worth the extra money? I think so but my friend disagreed and would have preferred the extra \u00a3550 to spend on something else. We enjoyed both holidays and will go back to Playacar again. Hotel ambience The Palace was much more refined on the whole, with people being less noisy. One evening at the Palace someone yelled out and everyone turned to look at them to see who was making a noise! The pace of the holiday was more relaxing at the Palace for me and I liked it but it was deemed a bit boring for my friend as there were fewer daytime and evening activities than we had had at the Yucatan. The Palace had more Americans than Europeans and the Yucatan had more Brits/Europeans than Americans. The Yucatan was livelier in many ways and had more of a party atmosphere. Outside Areas Both hotels were well laid out. The Palace had better air conditioning in the reception and restaurant/buffet areas. The Palace gardens were very formal whilst the Yucatan gardens had lots of trees which supported a range of wildlife including monkeys which came to visit you on your balcony looking for food. I hardly saw a mosquito at the Palace but had a hard time avoiding them at the Yucatan. Not sure if this was the time of year or because the hotel was in more natural surroundings. Rooms We stayed via Thomson and in both hotels this meant we got rooms facing away from the sea/pools/gardens but our views weren\u2019t that bad. Rooms in both hotels were surprisingly similar (I expected more from the Palace). Both had optic bottles of spirits on the wall, a fridge with soft drinks, beer, a safe, iron. The palace also had a coffee maker. The Palace room was bigger with a step down to a sitting area with a sofa and table and this was where the TV was located \u2013 not much good when you wanted to watch TV in bed. The TV wasn\u2019t any bigger or better than the one at the Yucatan. The Palace had a Jacuzzi bath and shower but it was in the same room as the washbasins and toilet. It was also very chunky in design and difficult to step in and out of. I slipped one evening and got a massive bruise on my inner thigh as a result. The Yucatan had the toilet separate to the washbasins and only had a shower but it was easier to share than the Palace. The Yucatan had the TV facing the bed. So overall we preferred the room at the Yucatan. Food & Drink Yucatan buffet was good with a good range of tasty food for breakfast, lunch and dinner but the Palace was superb \u2013 there was the same huge range but everything was better quality. There was champagne for breakfast, a chocolate fountain most evenings and every evening and most lunch-times the most tender beef steaks I have ever had on holiday (tried the steak at the Riu Palace Mexico and it was much tougher). Strangely, I put on less weight at the Palace RM. I put this down to the fact that everything you chose was lovely to eat so I just had one plateful and that was enough. At the Yucatan I didn\u2019t always like everything on my plate so went back for more so probably ate more overall. My rule at the Palace of \u2018one plate and one layer of food\u2019 appeared to work well. The only fault I can think of with the buffet was that they never made waffles for breakfast but I am sure the Yucatan did. Also, although men could wear smart shorts to the buffet in the evening the shorts were expected to cover their knees. Smart shorts cut above the knee were not considered formal enough. The Palace does a waiter service around the pool and beach which was luxurious. The speciality restaurants at both hotels were good and both required men to wear long pants. Activities Both hotels had excellent animation staff and did water aerobics, water volleyball, bingo, evening shows. The Palace did fewer games and virtually no prizes just certificates and Riu neck scarves every night!! I was gutted. At the Yucatan I won a massage, hats, bum bags, T-shirts and bottles of rum at bingo etc. I was really disappointed with the Palace whose highlight was a games evening and a casino style evening where you tried to win chips and exchange them for fairly trivial prizes. The Palace had a lunchtime fashion show round the pool selling bikinis and sarongs which I bought one of. Pools Both had 2 pools and a swim-up bar, the Yucatan had 2 swim-up bars. The Palace had an infinity pool and a large pool for activities and with Jacuzzi areas and the swim-up bar. The water was usually clean altho\u2019 by the end of the day there was some signs of suncream oil scum by one set of steps. The Yucatan pool was just as large and one of the swim-up bars was separate from the main pool. The main pool didn\u2019t feel very clean and the separate swim-up bar was so murky I wouldn\u2019t go in it. The Palace pools were far better. Both hotels had plenty of sunbeds round the pools but it seemed easier to find one at the Palace then at the Yucatan. Sea/beach At both hotels there were lots of sunbeds on the beach. More shade available at the Palace. Beach and sea similar as you would expect as they are not far from each other.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Doncaster, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cawsome awsome awsome awsome\u201d", "Author": "dooooooooood187067", "ReviewID": "UR116440040", "Content": "please please there is nothing bad about this resort at all no bad smells no bad food no bad entertainment it was the garden of eden me and the wife have been to every carribean islands the yucatan playacar is awsome for kids big kids anyone. enjoy all and ignore the rubbish you read please thx bungi", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot 5* but a decent hotel in an excellent location\u201d", "Author": "sunnybeacherTayside", "ReviewID": "UR116438552", "Content": "We stayed at the Yucatan in early July this year. The hotel is situated within the gated Playacar resort so totally safe to wander and set on one of the best Caribbean beaches. Check in was painless and we were conveniently located in block three. We had emailed the hotel in advance and requested rooms together which were efficiently organised. The rooms themselves are adequate. Good air con, free safe, fridge, complimentary toiletries and optics including local vodka, whisky, rum and of course tequila. The fridge is stocked every other day with soft drinks, water and beer. The rooms were cleaned daily to a high standard with fresh towels provided daily and sheets changed every other day. Plenty space for clothing with an iron and ironing board provided for your use. We missed having an ocean/pool view though so didn't make use of our balcony other than to hang clothes on the handy drying rack. We found the beds to be comfortable but disliked the visible staining on the bases and covers. The hotel itself is spotlessly clean set in beautiful grounds where you can see lots of local wildlife roaming around. The pools were also spotlessly clean, not quite refreshing during high temperatures though as they are heated. Beach towels were provided from a small hut at the poolside. The beach is stunning and literally right on your doorstep. Like most hotels you had to be down pretty early to get a poolside sunbed with shade but not the case on the beach. The beach was spacious, spotless and the sea made a pleasant escape from the heat of the sun. The only shade on the beach is palm trees which were effective in the midday sun. The watersports centre provided an array of AI activities in addition to payable ones and day trips. Whilst the food in the main buffet restaurant (which is air conned, phew) was of a decent quality with a vast choice I would be lying if I said we were impressed with the traditional Mexican fare. Come on Riu, not a fajita in sight the whole fortnight!!. Like most AI's we found the food was getting fairly repetitive by the end of the fortnight. We did at times find some of the food only lukewarm and during our second week the hotel was full so on occasions the restaurant chefs struggled to meet the demand . We also ate at the Steakhouse which was good and made a pleasant change to be served at the table. The bars all offered a good variety of drinks and branded names are available on request. Whilst there was a good choice of cocktails we found them to be fairly sweet as pre-mix's were used to make them. The swim up bar was fab and although this hotel doesn't have a beach bar, because of the close proximity of the beach to the swim up bar and the self service soft drink dispensers this wasn't a problem. We were disappointed in the entertainment. The main reason we chose the Yucatan was because we were travelling with lively teenagers so thought it offered the right vibe. Although there was entertainment round the pools during daytime it was limited to set times so was much quieter than we had anticipated. Even the music was only played during set times around the poolside. Never a fan of the AI evening entertainment we found it to be to the norm. The staff were friendly, polite and worked very hard to keep everyone happy. Reception offer money exchange with no commission fee and there is also an ATM situated in the lobby. Free Wi Fi is available in the lobby area. The hotel shop like most is a complete rip off but Wallmart is within a short taxi ride ($7 each way) or there is a shopping plaza within Playacar, turn right at the hotel exit and its a short walk away. We used the Beauty Salon and had manicure/pedicures along with a massage. All were fantastic and very reasonably priced. These can be booked at the massage tent alongside the main pool or in the salon itself which is outside the hotel on the right towards the exit gate. There are an array of stalls set up on the walkway down towards the entertainment on some evenings, other evenings you can find them at the other Riu hotels on the resort, which sell an assortment of gifts. We taxi'd into Playa Del Carmen on several occasions to shop, taste authentic Mexican cuisine, visit Senior Frogs, soak up the atmosphere on fifth avenue and to catch the ferry to Cozumel. We also booked a Catamaran trip at Wallmart. This saved us some peso's BUT we discovered on the day that it wasn't a Catamaran we travelled on to visit the very beautiful Isla Mujeres so my advice would be spend the extra and book with the watersports centre on the beach. We also did a trip with Edventures (see separate review) to zip line, cliff jump, swim in cenote's and with Turtles down in the Tulum/Akumel area - I cannot recommend Edventures highly enough, this was by far the best day of our holiday. So in summary whilst not a 5* hotel it's not that far off and enjoys a wonderful beach location. We didn't like the old fashioned safes or room keys which badly need updated. We also thought that one 24hr restaurant within the Riu hotels would not go amiss. I loved Mexico but if returning would look to go down to the Akumel/Tulum area as Playa Del Carmen was probably a little too commercialized for me - personal choice though of course. Tips:- Take plenty deet mozzi repellent as the mozzi's are bad - I took Bens insect repellent purchased from Amazon which was cheap, highly effective and kind on the nose. Wallmart for cheap booze, snacks and they also offer a good selection of cheap gifts. Ciggi's were about \u00a320 per carton but only American brands so cheaper and better choice at the airport. Departure tax is \u00a339pp which can be paid in pounds, peso's or dollars in cash or by credit/debit card. Barter in the gift shops/stalls and if purchasing jewellery from the hotel stalls check for hallmarks. The hotel does not accept payment in dollars which is bizzare as everything in the entire district is priced in dollars. If looking to get a tattoo we can recommend Mr Eight Balls in Playa Del Carmen. It cost around \u00a3150 for a decent sized tat and they did a great job.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississauga, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAlways a great stay at Riu!\u201d", "Author": "FPSTA", "ReviewID": "UR116362824", "Content": "Stayed at the Riu Yucatan July 16th thru 23rd.

The hotel feels very secure, you are given a safe lock and key for your stay, I would advise you lock up anything you dont want touching as the housekeeping will move things into drawers from off the side tables. Rooms are really spacious, I stayed in a twin with my cousin, we both had double beds. There is a mini bar fridge which gets stocked every two days with water, pepsi, fanta, 7up and beer which is part of an all-inclusive (so no charge) there are also four optic spirits in the bathroom also free, there are ice dispensers at the bottom of each stairwell as well. We had a balcony overlooking the pools and facing towards the beach, others had terraces you could sunbathe on. Air conditioning is excellent, except for the lobby (where there is free Wi-fi) but why spend all your time indoors when there is an absolutely beautiful beach right behind the hotel. Be wary about putting your orange towels (hotel given) down early, ours went missing on day 3 and its \u00a312 to replace them (although we spoke to our rep who kindly got us free ones), we used our bathroom towels (brown) instead and kept our towel cards in the safe. Two large pools, two outdoor restaurants (one turns into a Steakhouse for dinner and the other a Mexican a la carte) you dont pay extra for these but you need to be up early to book in advance for them, there is also a Chinese restaurant besides the main buffet hall which has themed nights (including Oriental) at least twice a week. The food was fantastic, lunch was perhaps the only repetitive meal but who cares about eating during the day, they have some fab cocktails! The hotel shops are very expensive, try not to buy from here, about 10 minutes walk down the round are some further shops, including a wonderful jewelers that we frequented many times! And for 70 pesos (under \u00a35) you can get a taxi to Fifth Avenue where there are plenty of shops, restaurants and bars. As part of the Riu package there are a further 3 more hotels on the same road - Tequilla, Playacar and The Palace. With the exception of the Palace you can also go into the other hotels for breakfast, lunch and use their facilities. We were also told, during a trip to Cancun, we could also go for drinks (free) at the Riu Cancun. The Riu Tequilla also has a sports bar (24 hours) and nightclub whilst Fifth Avenue also hosts a Coco Bongo club, 25 shows per night (starts at 11pm). The entertainment is very good, i'm not really into hotel entertainment so for me it was just background music but they work very hard to put on a show and afterwards there is normally a band, singer or entertainer (e.g. we had a saxophone player) on until early hours. The staff are superb, from when we arrived and had our bags taken up to our rooms for us to the bar staff (extremely friendly), reception (extremely helpful), room service make little towel animals for you, although this stops after a few days and then you get one or two at the end of your staff, but the cleaning is immaculate. Be sure to take mosquito protection for your legs as we went in a group of 14 and everyone bar the two youngest were bitten!

This is my third time to this area of Mexico. This visit was with hubby and 14 year old son. This resort is great for families who like to keep busy. It's location to Playa Del Carmen is fantastic and handy if you want to pop into town for a few hours, for a meal, shopping or to just hang out on a different beach. ROOM We arrived late evening, and were placed in a room in the 9000 building. I chose this hotel over the RIU Tequila for its proximity to the beach, and when we received this building, I was not impressed with it's location. We were told to wait until the next day as they were fully booked up that evening. Next day William at the front desk graciously accommodated us with a room change. We brought our bags down, and they then moved them to our new room early afternoon. Our new room was in the 2000 building - room 2304 which was just perfect. Upper floor with a view of the walkway down to the beach from the lobby. We enjoyed sitting out on the patio with a morning coffee watching the humming birds, and butterflies! It was very quite in the evenings as well. All standard rooms at the RIU have two double beds. Their king size is just the two double beds pushed together. We had requested a cot for my son and it was delivered quickly and without an extra charge! I do love a firm pillowtop bed, but these beds were hard as a rock! Very uncomfortable. I saw a few of the rooms being updated in the 6000 block of rooms, with new matresses, and some even had the foam pillow tops on them. Would advise to request these if you can. Didn't use the liquor cabinet at all, but the mini bar we requested additional 7UP, and received more as we left a tip for the mini bar man. Keep in mind, they only restock every other day. Rooms always well cleaned, and maintained well. (would like to see them replace the box springs when they replace the mattresses though....it looked like they were falling apart!) TIPPING No matter where we travel, we budget for gratutities for great service received. I know everyone had received great service at this hotel, so why or why don't people show their appreciation for it with a dollar or two? It just astounded me that people would not tip. I brought many USD $1 bills and left them for the maid, the mini bar guy, and the wonderful waiters, waitresses and bartenders. Please tip for the great service that is provided to you! GROUNDS The grounds at this hotel were just incredible. I liked the fact that you could walk out and see the coatis, agoutis, iguanas, and the rather large monkeys! Grounds people did a fantastic job keeping the pathways clear of falling leaves, and seaweed off the beach when a wind would come along and stir things up. What I do like is that it's not a huge area of land. You don't need to take a shuttle to the beach from here! WEATHER OK...rainiy season anywhere usually brings along insects with it. I knew this before I went. Mosquitos love me and yep, I did get quite a few bites despite the repellent I brought. Also bring After Bite with you. It's a great relief. Found out also there is a Mexican repellent that you can get (yellow bottle with a red cap) that is supposed to be very good. I saw it up at the market just down from the RIU Tequila. Not sure what the deet content is, but I'm sure it is a pretty high percentage. FOOD My son is a picky eater, so we didn't do a lot of the a la cartes. Hubby and I did the asian restaurant twice. We actually thought it was pretty good. However, please tell me why there is no table service though? It is really still a buffet, but just in a different room! You still have to get up from the table and select your food. None of the waiters actually served you, unless you requested something off the \"menu\". (like deep fried ice cream!) The food was pretty good at the asian. My son loved the buffet. He doesn't eat much, but what he did have, he had no complaints! Personally, I was getting tired of the buffet by the end of the week, and having to serve myself. Food is good, but not great. The buffet for lunch was quite busy, I'm thinking because people from other resorts come to this one during the day for the beach and pool areas. We actually spent three lunch days at the RIU Tequila which had fantastic lunches by their pool restaurant. It was great to have the flexibility to go there. My son loved the sports bar at the Tequila as there were snacks available there, as well as fussball tables, pool tables, video games, air hockey, and internet available. (you willl need pesos for these....you can get change made for you from the bar area) The sports bar was the best air conditioned room in the entire hotel! There is a shuttle from the \"beach club\" (which is the Mexican restaurant at night) that you can take to the lobby of the Tequila. Just a golf cart, and only holds 7 people or so. The pathway is more of a direct walk than from the front lobby. DRINKS I love tequila, and I love margaritas. The margaritas at this resort are horrible! They use a premixed VERY SWEET mix which just ruins the drink for me. Fernando at the lobby bar does make the best margaritas when we asked to have the top shelf tequila, on the rocks, and not too sweet. He was quite accommodating, and we showed our appreciation with a few dollars. Next night, he saw us approaching the bar, and was already making our margaritas for us! For a change try a top shelf tequila with club soda and fresh lime - very refreshing. One other thing, the plastic glasses they reuse are a great idea, however, I watched how they clean them, and they don't do a great job with that. We brough our Bubba mugs which we preferred to use instead. Kept the drinks cold with fewer trips to the bar. One thing they could do is at least have pool side service. Really miss that. Other resorts I've been to also have beach service. This would be a great touch. Even lobby table service in the evenings would be nice instead of having to wait at the bar. Just a thought!!!!??? ENTERTAINMENT The entertainment team did their best to get people to participate. We chose not to do too much with them, but to do more activities on our own. I would like to see them have more organized activities for teens. There is a kids club, but not a teen club. There were many teens staying at the hotel and I\"m sure it would have been a hit to have activities geared towards them. The evening entertainment wasn't the greatest I've seen. The Mexico show was probably the best. We acutally went to a few of the shows at the RIU Tequila which were fantastic! The Las Vegas show there was pretty good, with a great Elvis impersonater! I love the way the Tequila has their stage setup right at the front of the property further away from the rooms. Great idea. BEACH The beach is fantastic! We spent most of our time beachfront, and you will not be diappointed with this beach. There's only so much the grounds people can do to keep the seaweed off the shore. It's the sea, so yes, there will be seaweed lurking about. We had our own snorkel equipment with us, which we used to see assorted fish in the area. Since the beach was busy, there weren't a lot of fish about. There isn't a reef or rocks close to shore, either, so if you want to do some serious snorkeling, you would have to travel to an area with more reefs about. That being said, this is a great beach area for small ones to play in the sand and walk along the shore. A few resorts south of the beach, there are turtle nests being protected. Hatching is expected from Aug 7 - 22nd, so if you are gong during this period, you should head on down and check it out. I would stay at this resort again, but it would have to be a really good deal. I'd honestly consider staying at the Tequila over the Yucatan. If the price would be better at the Tequila, I'd stay there for sure. I'd love to try the RIU Palace as well, but that would only be without our son tagging along! We just wouldn't get our moneys worth. RIU Yucatan is a great value though for a family vacation which was the purpose of this trip. Not the best place if you are planning a romantic getaway. If you head to PDC, check out the Fusion Beach Club. Great drinks and great food right on the beach. Live bands there are awesome! Fire show in the evenings as well.

The staff are all very polite and friendly and make you feel special. small touches I know but remembering the drinks you order or showing you how to make a cocktail makes all the difference.

Yes there is better out there but everything at the Yucatan is fresh and nicely presented and the choice is wide enough to suit most palates. The speciality restaurants made a nice change from the buffet and offered the opportunity to slow down the process of eating your evening meal. The rooms were clean and comfortable with all the necessary amenities. They are cleaned daily and to a high standard. The pool area got really busy and that isn't really to our tastes but those enjoying it were happy enough. The beach was amazing. very clean and the waters are crystal clear. When the storms washed up seaweed in the mornings , the Riu crew were out collecting it and buried it in the beach...nice touch! Lots of sunbeds and no major issues with towel hangers. The animation team were very friendly and not at all pushy. They work incredibly hard and do a great job. Some fun stuff went on in and amongst the usual waterpolo and volleyball activities. Scuba Caribe team help you with snorkeling and Kayaking and will also arrange Jetski, Parasail and Scuba Diving. I nervously attempted Scuba for the first time and thanks to Juan the dive instructor from Argentina got the hang of it quickly in the pool and went to the reef in open water and completed my first dive. Didn't really sightsee too much as our major reason for a holiday this year was rest and recuperation. However, we did visit Xplor which was expensive to go to but in the end well worth the money. Zip lines, cave swimming, rafting and 4x4 driving plus all the food and drink you wanted. We booked the trip through Thomson but got the impression afterwards that we could have done cheaper through the many vendors selling trips. Personal choice I guess. 5th Avenue is the shopping area and takes a bit of getting used to. Every shop owner wants you visit their shop with promises of 'cheaper than Tesco' and 'almost free'. Gets a bit much after a while and I soon tired of being polite and saying no thank you. A bit more force is required or just look the other way. Still all Mexican people are very nice so you never feel overly uncomfortable. One trick to watch out for is that when they see your 'all inclusive Riu band' they pretend to recognise you and tell you that they work at Riu. Don't be fooled, this is just a ruse to slow you down and suck you into a conversation you don't want to have. Last thing...Before we set off, I emailed the hotel to request that our family had adjoining rooms. I was very pleased to receive a prompt and polite reply with a promise to do everything possible to accede to my request. Thank you Josebo.

All of us had a great time, with no complaints at all. We booked through Expedia, 2 rooms for $4200. Comments: OFF WE GO.... We took a Continental direct flight from Austin to Cancun that was an easy 2 hours. No delays, lots of families. The Cancun airport is looking great, and customs/immigration was easy- things are much improved since the last time we went (couple of years ago). Our transfer was through Best Day, which made a couple of stops before the Yucatan. It took about an hour. Wonderful driver, great a/c, excellent. The GOOD.... Number ONE is all the service staff: the front desk, very gracious and accomodating; the housekeeping staff, constantly making you comfortable; the bar staff, keeping those cocktails coming; the gardeners, keeping the grounds pretty and impeccable; he entertainment staff, keeping things fun (more on them later); and the kitchen/dining staff, serving and cooking with a smile. I can't say enough good things about the fine folks who work at the Yucatan, nothing is impossible for them, and they are always smiling. The General Manager is very hands on, and you will see him walking around, checking things out and totally open for your comments and questions. His office door is open- literally and symbolically. We had a great chat about how he runs this amazing place. -The beach is fabulous, and the access is great. You are literally steps to the beach. The nice thing is that you can sit at the pool and see the beach, I just love that. The beach staff works so hard to keep the area clean and free of seaweed- a couple of days that there was significant seaweed, they actually buried it, wow. Getting a beach chair is easy- there are many of them. There's not much shade, but if you're willing to around to the side of the resort, that's very shady (by the scuba shop). You will see all kinds of bathing suits (or lack thereof) at the beach and occaisionally at the pool. A few ladies chose to be topless at the pool and wander around, but that was just one day. Generally, ladies are not topless at the pool. The pools are fine, but tend to be warm, too warm for me. They're very clean first thing in the morning, but tend to dirty up as the day goes by. Not the staff's fault... Getting a pool chair is impossible after 10.00. All the shady chairs are gone by 9. We're runners, so we're up early, not a problem for us. Lots of disappointed folks who show up at 10.30 looking for a good pool spot. -The food was terrific. I know it's not cool to say that food at an AI is good, but let me tell you, as a foodie, I can say that for a buffet, it was excellent. Anything you want is available: salad, fruit, vegetables, meat, chicken, fish, pasta, bread, you name it. Breakfast is especially great- the fruit juice and smoothies are wonderful, and worth visiting several times :) We liked the barbeque restaurant (this Texan says the steaks were great), the Mexican was fine, but the Asian....more later. Yes, you have to wake up early to get a reservation. Take a tour of the kitchens, it's amazing. I think the tour is on Mondays. -The location of the Yucatan is another plus. Playa is a $7 ride away, there's a little shopping mart across the street, and the street that the Yucatan is on is perfect for running. There's also a golf course across the street that is good for running, too. The hotel has a pretty nice little gym, it does get full. The BAD..... -The entertainment crew sometimes gets out of hand, at least for my taste. My favorite time of the day was when they'd go to lunch and put the jazz on! :) Our kids did like all the funny stuff, like the soccer competitions, the water aerobics, the bingo (\"69. the international number...\"), bikini contest, etc., etc. They have to do this for the people who like it, but I don't. Different strokes.... -It would be nice to have a more organized kid activitiy center, maybe video games, or board games, for a break from the sun and heat. By day 6, our 9 year old was getting restless. The kid club I think was more for the babies/toddlers. The UGLY.... -The rooms are fine, completely comfortable, but yes, could use a makeover, especially the linens. -The WILD SPANISH PHARMACY STUDENTS FROM BARCELONA. This huge group, at least 40 of them, took over the hotel with their loud, drunken partying. They would come home at 6 am, screaming, singing, etc. The hotel was as exasperated as we were, and they would tone it down one night and take it up again the next. Sad to see such self absorbed, rude, and classless kids. As they say, Karma is a b**** , I can only hope that they all have a similar experience when they're grown ups. -I didn't see much- if any- tipping, and I consider that ugly. We tipped the housekeepers, the waiters, and the bartenders. I budgeted $100 for tips, which I felt was not excessive. I didn't see anyone leave money on the table at meals (even the a la carte!) and that surprised me, especially with the level of service. Oh well. All in all, everything that the hotel could control was wonderful. The other stuff was just part of being on vacation!

The hotel was sold out and it was very busy. This hotel was rated as a 5 star plus with my travel agency but I would say it was a solid 4 star. The rooms were dated and much smaller then those that I have stayed at during other all inclusive trips to the Playa del Carmen area. However they were clean and the AC worked great. In all reality you don't go to Mexico to stay in your room. The pool was clean and was jammed packed everyday. They did run out of beach towels twice during our stay. The beach itself was great. White sand and no large pieces of rock. There were lots of activities and there was always multiple beach chairs available. The hotel is within the Playacar area so it is more or less a gated community with security at all entrances. We felt safe at all times and the area is close enough that you can walk right into Playa Del Carmen in about 20-25 minutes. If not you can take a cab for $7.00 or 70 pesos. It should also be mentioned that the hotel caters to a large european clientele and therefore there is a lot of topless tanning on the beaches. I just thought I should let people know that so that if they are offended by this this may not be the resort for them. As well there was a lot of smokers at the resort so if this is also something that bothers you you may want to avoid this hotel. The hotel also has a buffet and 3 speciality restaurants. The speciality restaurants have to be booked in the morning of the day you want to eat there for supper. They were usually all booked by 9am. We ate at the Asian and the Mexican restaurant and they were both excellent. The buffet was also amazing with lots of options that actually had flavour unlike all of the other buffets I have been to at all inclusive resorts in this area. Usually by the end of your stay you dread going to eat at the buffets because it all starts to taste the same and this was not the case at this resort because it had great food. All in all this was my fifth trip to the area and it was by far the best hotel I have stayed at for an all inclusive. I would recommend this hotel to anybody. As a note I did notice that during my trip I never seen anybody tipping the staff. These people work there butts off for little pay so don't be so cheap and give a buck or two when you see somebody doing a great job whether it be a waiter, bartender or maid. In a week we spent $35.00 on tips and they were all much appreciated and you will never be without an empty glass if you give your server a dollar. If you can spend upwards of $2000 on a trip I'm sure you can tip a bit. Its just the first time that I never seen anybody tip and it was kind of sad.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Inverness, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cClean and very friendly\u201d", "Author": "Campbeg2", "ReviewID": "UR115773753", "Content": "As a squad of Invernessians over for a 50th Birthday Party, we stayed at the Yucutan between 4th July and 18th July and it was excellent. There was 7 of us, varying in age between 21 and 50 and apart from the dodgy weather in the first week can't complain in any way. ROOM For all of the ladies, the rooms were very clean with towels changed every day. There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room but you do have a mini-bar and range of optics to choose from, with an ice maker between blocks, which you can help yourself to. There is an ice bucket in your room for that reason. There is a good size shower cubicle with hot water at all times. No bath, but who cares. You're on holiday. Enjoy. FOOD The buffet restaurant is first class and to be honest we tended to use this most of the time but did visit the Asian Restaurant, which is also buffet, and the Steak House which is meant to be a la carte, but given the steak and chicken etc that's on offer in the main buffet we didn't see the point of booking the Steak House a 2nd time. You do need to book your meals for the Asian, Steak House and Mexican at between 7:00 and 7:30 am. You book this in the main buffet restaurant. BARS Getting back to the bar situation, we spent a fair bit of time at the lobby bar with Fernando and Beatriz supplying us with good brand drinks, when you ask for them. Smirnoff vodka and Havana Reserve Dark Rum available at all bars. Try the cocktails, which are superb at which ever bar you choose. Mojitos, Margueritas, Daquiris of any flavour. Tequila sunrises, Capairania and you've got to try the Mexican Flag. Grenadine with Tequila spooned on top, with coloured green tequila on top, with a dribble of flaming brandy which you drink through a straw. Very quickly. Superb. BEACH Fantastic, clean, plenty of sunbeds although the sun beds at the pool have padded mattresses, this would not be practical on the beach as they'd get blown all over the place. Water warm but not too warm.(ps there are very small areas cordoned off with canes and tape where turtles have laid their eggs. POOL/POOL BARS Again, very clean with first class bar service. The water was very warm so not as refreshing as the sea water. Still magic though. GARDENS Beautiful. Even better with the animal life. The wee Ceretas and Copa Mundi are great to see, along with the monkeys which seem to pop across the road from the Riu Tequila. Iguanas and Gekos roam around the place too but don't bother you. Great to see. MOSQUITOES There were a good few of the wee blighters, but take Deet or Jungle Formula, and they shouldn't bother you. The Boots stuff doesn't work. Be sure and spray your ankles well as that's where they get you. STAFF Fantastic. The Mayans must be one of the friendliest nations ever. Genuinely happy, friendly and pleased to see you. (40 pesos as a tip also helps but they're worth every penny) MANAGER/DIRECTOR Apologies for not remembering his name but the guy is an absolute gent and can be seen mixing with his guests to see what sort of service thay are receiving from his staff and he can also be seen having his breakfast and dinner etc in the restaurants. Gracias Amigo, if you read this. (he also arranged for the weather to improve after a showery first week. SISTER HOTELS The Riu Tequila and Riu Playacar were also very nice but the Yucutan is the best of the 3. Worth trying the bars and retaurants for a change. PLAYACAR Is only about 30mins away on foot and has several good shops but the bulk are tick-tack shops, selling colourfull crafts works, T-shirts etc. Worth a jaunt. The ladies will like the chance to spend some pesos. MONEY We took Pesos with us but American Dollars are accepted readily, no matter what the brochures say. You can also get a very good rate of exchange using Sterling.(Not Scottish notes I'm afraid, only English) Exchange when we were over was \u00a31 = 18.5pesos whereas the rate in the UK was only 16pesos to the \u00a31 in Thomson shops. EXCURSIONS We visited Chichen Itza and Coba Village which are fantatic if you have any interest in history and culture in your bones. Costs through Thomson are \u00a374 and \u00a373 respectivley with food and drinks included. The restaurant food is also included but you have to buy drinks. We also swam with Whale sharks which is an experience not to be missed. \u00a3140 well spent. (Can be a bit choppy with quite a few folk chundering over the side of the boat) All in all, The Riu Yucutan is a very good hotel and worth a return visit.

Which the day after, it did! The hotel is fantastic, every member of staff is extremely pleasant, in and out of the restraunts they were constantly around and about offering to help. There are four restraunts, one of the restraunts is an open one which you can use between something like 6pm and 1030pm. This is a brilliant restraunt, fully air conditioned with table service for drinks, and a huge buffet with food for literally everyone. The other three restraunts, got to be said was a bit disappointed - not with the food - but with how you booked the restraunts. You had to book these on the day of the evening you wanted to go there, and the table bookings had to be made by the breakfast room (main dinner/breakfast/lunch hall) at a ridiculous hour of 7.00. We had to go down at 6.45am every morning to get a table, once we arrived at that time and all tables had gone - and there is only two sittings for each restraunt, with an approximately capacity of about 15 tables (tables of any size really) and by the size of the hotel - thats not a lot. This is the ONLY downfall of the hotel. If you don't mind getting up at that time, then its definately worth it. We managed to book for 3 nights out of the 7 we stayed for, and the food was absolutely brilliant, 3 of the nicest meals I've ever had in my life infact. All inclusive guests at this hotel can use the other RIU hotels close by to the Yucatan, but only for breakfast and dinner - we personally didn't bother. Moving on, there are several bars dotted around the hotel complex, including two pool bars which are amazing and the service is fantasic. The rooms are massive and the maid service is the best I've ever experienced - the mini bar is also reloaded every two days. Bed's are a bit hard I thought personally but then again I am a bit fussy! The hotel is located right next to the beach, right next to a watersports centre for those who wish to Jet ski, parasail, scubadive etc. At night times, there are 3 bars which are open til late, two of them are located by the stage where every night a different act is on, e.g. Abba, Grease, Hits etc - these are very good and also very good for kids too. Also I believe that this hotel is normally the first drop off as it is at the end of the hotels so is normally the first - but don't take my word for that!. So in conclusion, I had a brilliant week, there is lots of tours and activity days etc which is all bookable easily by the hotel, I would definately go here again!!!", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "swinton manchester", "Title": "\u201cOut of this World\u201d", "Author": "malandsteve", "ReviewID": "UR115146780", "Content": "We arrived at the hotel on June 18th and were amazed by this hotel.

The restaurants were amazing, some people complained that it was repetative but they were the ones who piled their plates high with everything off the buffet, so no wonder they got fed up, there was some very greedy people who wasted alot of food. There was lots of food to choose from, the mashed potatoes were the best I have ever tasted, nothing was any trouble for the staff. We were greeted every evening with cocktails before our meal and every member of staff smiled and loved their job. The pool was tested quite a few times a day and the beach was amazing, the sea was quite rough at times but not being a good swimmer this didnt prove a problem. The entertainment was very good, shows on every night but you did get a bit fed up of watching dancing there is only so much you can watch, the Grease and Michael Jackson show were brilliant, they lip sinked the words. I have never been in a hotel that had so much food and drink flowing all day, we did find out at the end of the holiday that in the main reception near the bar there was a fridge with sandwiches after 10pm. The Thomson reps were really good, sorted any problems out and even had a box with all sorts in left by other holiday makers. I could find no fault with the hotel or Thompson in any way. I would only go to a Riu hotel after this experience. THE BAD POINTS The pound against the dollar is not very good, so trips are quite expensive. In town the shops mither the life out of you, we only shopped in places that had the prices, we couldnt be bothered bartering, they even thought the British were the best to rip off. Every person in town was our waiter called Carlos who was working on his day off in his uncles silver shop. At first we thought this was true but when you are approached by about 20 Carlos's who served us the night before it begins to wear thin, so my hubby used to say he was Carlos and they left us alone. The trips in Town are cheaper but only because they were trying to sell time share, so beware. We found Thomson cheaper and more informative. We went to Puerto Adventurous for the Dolphin Trainer for life, it was brilliant, but some of the dolphins had cuts to their mouths, some of our group had no breakfast or no dinner, it was not a full day as they advertise and we were rushed into see the photographs which were selling for \u00a3148, we did get a free photo after asking quite a few times and was presented with a photo as though we were holding a dead dolphin. The whole coach load complained about the treatment and we got a free trip to see the dolphins again. It was a full day on a catamaran to the Isla Mujeras near Cancun, we went on the dolphin adventure and it was far superior to the last one. The dolphins were in tip top condition, we had over 3 hours with them and did far more than the first trip. It was an all inclusive resort so drinks and food were on tap, they had a swimming pool, hammocks, bars, water fountains and the dolphins swam in massive enclosures in the sea. The day lasted from 7 in the morning to 7 at night. A fantastic day. We also went to the pirate ship which was called Captain Hooks, it was an experience I will never forget, it was brilliant so try and book this, its a night to remember, we were served lobster and steak. I wont tell you much about this as it will spoil the trip. The mosquitos are little sods, even though we bought repellent they still bit me, but we did find out that there is a different repellent to take, look for tropical repellent or buy in the resort, its far better. Try Walmart the make up is cheaper, Steve got an official Manchester United top for \u00a315. The Mac makeup store is well cheaper than the UK.

The all inclusive is 24 hours so you can actually get food and drink should you require it at any time day or night. Each room as a mini bar which is restocked every couple of days also there are 4 optics with shorts that you can drink as much as you like at no cost. The food was amazing spoilt for choice at every meal, there are 3 other resturants onsite Mexican, Asian and a Steak house you have to reserve a place for these but we never had a problem getting in. The steak house was our favourite. The Margarita is a snack bar at the side of the pool you can get a good variation of food and drink in there most of the day, the only down side is the large black crow type birds that fly freely around helping themselves from scraps on tables, the main restaurant La Hacienda which is in the reception area also has visits from birds but not as many as the poolside. The beach is lovely very clean, plenty of sun beds but no parasols which was a shame, the palm trees where used for shade, the sun is very strong so take a good high factor sun cream. The sea can be a bit rough with a strong under current. All non motorized water sports are free. The entertainment team work very had throughout the day, the night time shows are pretty good, we went out the hotel a few times at night either going to the othe Rui hotels or going up to 5th avenue, you do get a bit of hasstle but it makes a change and the Mexican people are very friendly. The trips can work out a little expensive depending which you want to do, we went to Explore which was really good value for money, get there when it opens you need a full day to do everything, the food is fantastic it is included in the admission fee.

I travelled the with my partner and we couldn't of been happier with our choice.\u00a0 The rooms are very spacious with lots of storage facilities for clothes, etc. We had 2 double beds in our room and still had lots of space. The balcony doors come with a second 'net' door which comes in very handy for keeping out insects! The safe which is located in the wardrobe was quite old fashioned but secure. The bathroom area is sectioned off by curtains but the toilet does have a door. The fridge and mini bar are located in this area which was re-stocked almost everday with beer, soft drinks and water. \u00a0The shower was spotless and like other reviews state it does not just trickle out, it is actually powerful. The rooms do have a tv with a small selection of english language channels. The beds were comfortable enough for us however, some may find then quite firm. The grounds of the hotel are beatiful, constantly being worked on to keep them this way. The pools are quite large and always kept clean. There is also a pool bar in each pool which is a nice touch. To get a sunbed around the pool you need to get up quite early to reserve but you could get a sunbed on the beach throughout the day easily. The beach was amazing, white sand and clear waters. We perfered it here as there is a sea breeze (which is nice in the 40 degree heat!). The staff are always keeping it clean and tidy by collecting empty glasses and rubbish. There are sales people that try and sell things like silver and henna tattoos but with a polite 'no thank you' they move on. The food was fantastic, lots of choice for all 3 meals. The three speciality resturants are nice however, there is no atmosphere in the mexican and asian. We found the steakhouse the best and the mexican our least favourite due to the non-authentic atmosphere, we feel that a little bit of traditional mexican music at the least would suffice. The staff are absolutely great and very happy to accommodate you in any way in order to make your stay more enjoyable! They are all so helpful and friendly. We rang the reception to ask for more pillows and within 5 minutes someone was at our door with them. The maids do a great job cleaning the rooms and leave towel art animals often which is a really nice touch.\u00a0 There is alot of wildlife around the hotel grounds but they dont bother you at all.\u00a0 The only complaint I would have is, I asked reception if it was possible for them to decorate the room for my partners birthday and I was told that it would be, however, this did not happen.

The transfer from Cancun airport took about 50 minutes and once we arrived we were greeted by one of the hotel staff you cheerfully provided us with room keys, safe locks and advised as to what was included in our 'all inclusive' package (practically everything!) as well as which of the other nearby Riu hotels we could access (which proved useful as some of the excursions we booked independently only pick up from certain hotels). The room was very large with a balcony, free satellite TV and a huge bed. There was free (and very strong) air conditioning which you can control, a good sized bathroom and a large wardrobe (with plenty of hangers - a must for woman on holiday!). There were only 2 pillows but the hotel staff provided 2 more straight away once asked. The rooms were cleaned daily and the mini bar refilled when empty. There was no wifi in the room but there was free access in the large lobby area where there are plenty of chairs and sofas. The buffet restaurant was good and had a range of different options available. Breakfasts consisted of cakes, muffins, pastries, yoghurts, fruit, different types of eggs, different types of bacon/beef etc, cereals, ham, cheese, breads, pancakes, jams, tea, coffee, fresh juices and more and dinner consisted of different meats, fish, rice, breads, salad, potatoes, desserts, ice-cream, wine, beer, coffee and more. The poolside restaurant had a smaller number of options at lunch time such as salads, chips, pasta, rice, fish, burgers, fruit and ice-cream but it was too hot for us to want any lunch most days. The a la carte restaurants however were not so good - bad in fact (we tried the Mexican and Steak House but there is also an Asian restaurant). The quality of the food was poor and the service not much better. The restaurants had no atmosphere whatsoever and a number of people actually left before finishing their meal - we recommend sticking to the buffet. I would also say it\u2019s definitely a good idea to treat yourselves to at least a couple of meals outside the hotel as although the buffet is good it\u2019s not great and the food in Mexico can be fantastic. The Pool was very nice. One area seemed to attract young American tourists intent on getting drunk whereas the other areas were much quieter with families & couples relaxing and children playing. The beach (which the hotel leads right on to) is beautiful and the sea is lovely and clean. There are plenty of complimentary sun loungers as well as a number of water sports available (for a charge) if that\u2019s what you enjoy doing. The grounds were clean and were rich in green vegetation. There were monkeys and birds in the trees as well as lots of Capybaras wondering around. The location of the hotel was also great - it was right on the beach as well as being a short 10 min taxi drive to the main Avenida 5 which cost about 70 pesos (approx. \u00a34). You can also walk it in about 40mins depending on how fast you walk but it\u2019s not a great walk and is often far too hot.

We chose to go for one week which was well worth travelling the distance for. Upon our arrival we were greeted by the hotle management and a slush non alcoholic cocktail - a great refreshment after being on the coach for about 50 mins. The room was pleasantly clean and kept well, if your expecting a modern room then this isn't what you get, the rooms are typically mexican with wooden detailing and bright coloured fabrics - no complaints from us this is just what we were expecting. The food was really tasty and there was something for everyone no matter what your tastes are, we didn't go to the ala carte places as we were more than happy with the food in the buffet area. We had one day of rain but this was a welcome retreat to from the sun and we managed to walk to and back from '5th avenue' this is a shopping area great for souveniers and for authentic food and drink. Be warned its about 45 mins to a\\n hour walk and in the heat it seems alot longer. The resort of Playa Car is superb and very safe, if you prefer to get a cab there are taxis available and we're told that these are too very safe. Be warned at the airport you'll be pestered by porters wanting to carry your bags and they do want tipping for this, we politely declined a few times and they eventually left. The Mexicans on 5th avenue can be very perswasive so always be prepared to walk away if you feel uncomfortable, or don't want to pay the price they ask. Bartering is something you'll become familiar with when you visit mexico, you should be able to get 30-40% off the asking price at most places. Back to the hotel, the pool and bars were all clean, and the staff are second to none always there to help and assist you. The sea was rough when we were there which is typical of that coast so be careful in the sea and look at the flags before attempting to go for a dip. Our room was next to the pool which was ideal for nipping back for suncreams etc but the night entertain ment can be quite noisy there All in all we had a superb trip and would definatly go back!", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Exeter, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot quite 5* but very close...\u201d", "Author": "Pearny", "ReviewID": "UR114967883", "Content": "This was our first trip to Mexico and our first stay in a Riu hotel and we were not disappointed with either. OK, the hotel is looking abit tired and could do with modernising but other than that we couldn't fault it. The food was good, plenty to choose from (unless your a fussy eater like our daughter, then you'd probably live on freshly made pizza,chips and pasta!!) but can imagine it would get quite repetitive if you stay for 2 weeks, much like any other All Inclusive resort. We ate at the Asian & Steakhouse restaurants and both were good. The only downside to the Steakhouse is you don't get a choice of the starters, they bring out everything for you (there are 3 starters!!!) so by the time you get your Steak, your full-up! The pudding was delicious and a nice end to the meal. The pools are clean but not particulary family/child friendly. There is only 1 tiny childrens pool and the side is quite bumpy and scratchy so the kids might find themselves with a few scratches on their legs and tummies when trying to get out. The pavers get very hot so would definately recommend wearing flipflops to get to the pool!! We did notice the 'SCUM' floating ontop of the Jacuzzi pool and avoided that one, but the pools are cleaned morning and evening and throughout the day to remove any debris that has fallen in. The rooms were clean and tidy and we had several towel creations which our daughter liked. Not many english TV channels and although you don't go on holiday to watch TV, abit of background noise in english would be nice!!! Would definately recommend taking Mosquito Spray for the room - we were plagued one night by the little blighters. Housekeeping gave us a can of bug spray which we kept and sprayed every evening before we went for dinner and weren't bothered by them again. Also recommend buying some mosquito repellant for yourself - I felt like I was being eaten alive in the evenings! If you do forget it, the drugstore on the complex sells a liquid in a yellow bottle with a red lid which you put on and your not bothered at all by the bugs!! Staff throughout the complex were friendly and we didn't feel intimidated at all. The entertainment in the evenings was very good and yes, at times it was abit cheesy, the staff work very hard to put on a good show for the whole family and actively look for audience participation so be prepared!! The beach was amazing - beautiful white sand and blue sea. The sea was a bit rough so we didn't go swimming but just to be able to paddle in it was enough for me and my daughter! We did venture into Playa Del Carmen by taxi which cost 70pesos each way and visited Walmart! It's brilliant if you've forgotten anything and is much cheaper than the shops within the complex. Starbucks is a 10 minute walk away from the hotel and we did treat ourselves to a hot chocolate even though it was in the high 90's outside!!! There are also some souvenier shops on the same strip. We did one of the trips offered by our holiday company which was the Trainer For Life programme at Dolphin Discovery in Puerto Adventuras. It was A-MAZ-ING and worth every penny. One word of warning - if your travelling with young children (under 1mtr 20cms) they will not be able to participate. We didn't find this out until the day we went and after 4 days were given our money back for our daughter (child price is the same as adults 179 USD). We didn't venture into any of the other Riu hotels as most of their guests seem to come to the Yucatan! All in all, the Riu Yucatan is the best All Inclusive hotel we have ever stayed in in the fact you can help yourself to nearly everything throughout the day (food, drink, ice cream) without having to queue. As I said in the beginning, it could benefit from abit of modernising but all in all, a nice hotel and would definately recommend it.

Also a tip if you want named brands just ask for them and you will get it, Smirnoff Absolute Vodka was great.

The food in the steak house and the mexican restaurants were over cooked, although dessert was quite good. Except for william and the young ladies working the front desk, all the other conceirges are just rude and very sarcastic, which was quit annoying when we were in a bad mood due to the rain for 3 days! good things to check out in mexico! the jungle place - $50 This is a must do!!! A couple whose plans were to retire instead created a sanctuary for spider monkeys who have been badly abused, they don't advertise themselves on trip advisor but they do have a website! Its $50 each person and all the money goes to the monkeys. Heidi, the owner, is a very sweet lady and very easy to communicate with! The monkeys are very sweet and loving and you can tell that they are happy living there! It is well worth going to because its an amazing one on one experience with the animals and you are donating to a great cause, because the government there doesnt help them at all! xel ha - $99 Another must do!! You start off by dropping off all your valuables in a safe which meet you on the other side of the lake at the end of the day! Than you get your equipment and hop onto a flaoting tire in the lazy river ; along the way you have the option of jumping off a cliff, zip lining, or rope walking! After that you can start snorkeling and see tons of fish! Than whenever you want, how many times you want, you can indulge in 1 of the 3(or all 3) buffets, alcohalic drinks included! There is also the option of walking a trail or bike riding, both have beautiful views! party hopper -$85 Our ride there was horrible, we were driven by some old man who did not get us in the mood to party, but the guy who actually took us to the clubs was great!!

We than went to \"Senor Frogs\" which was so much fun, they have live singers, conga lines, balloons, and free shot glasses!

We are both 26 and from Canada and coming from someone who's stayed at a number of resorts and hotels, I will try to focus on the stuff people actually care about: COMPOUND The compound is made up of a number of different resorts, most of which are Rius. You are free to use the other Rius for everything except dinner and you aren't allowed to use the Riu Palace properties, as they are rated higher (and are more expensive). There are also a number of shops, a deli, pharmacies, jewellery stores, and a Starbucks. The entire compound is gated, patrolled, and very secure. Everyone I spoke to felt comfortable moving around the compound at any time of the day or night. There are security guards everywhere, taxis driving by, and resort police so it is highly unlikely that anyone would approach you. HOTEL The hotel is a little outdated (completed in 97) but completely adequate and featured the important amenities that most people are looking for in a hotel. (Free WiFi, variety store/pharmacy open until 10 pm, 24 hr front desk, etc.) The only trouble spot that I would point out with the main area of the hotel is that it is unbearably hot through the day. It is an open space that can't really be air conditioned, so it's pretty much a total sweat fest if you're going to be in the lobby for an extended period of time (which you may be because this is the only area with free WiFi.) ROOMS There are 9 buildings that are 3 stories each and are open concept. There are no elevators so if you are moving your own luggage to the third floor, be warned that you will face stairs. The building areas are very clean and fairly quiet. The animals that are around tend to be quite passive but they are scavengers and will return to the scene of the crime if you start feeding them, so please don't! The rooms again are adequate but outdated. The view is nothing special as there are very few rooms (if any) with an ocean or pool view. The liquor dispenser is stocked with rum, tequila, vodka, and gin and the mini bar is filled with Dos Equis, Pepsi products, and bottled water. If you run out of bottled water, the bar staff will be happy to provide you with more bottles free of charge. If you are like me and drink a ton of bottled water, buy it off the resort as the Riu stores charge almost double what other vendors charge for drinks and snacks. The beds are a little hard, but really nothing to complain about unless you are the type of person who demands a very soft bed. The biggest complaints with the rooms would be old fashioned keys (no key cards) which are very bulky and difficult to use (it's also difficult to get a second room key and when you receive it, it is essentially a house key and doesn't come on a chain or ring or anything, so be very careful as you have to pay $10 if you lose it.) and also the room safe. The room safe is essentially four pieces of welded metal, welded to the inside of the closet. It has an open hole where the lock is to rest. When you check in, you will receive a lock that will fit into the hole in your safe, as well as a safe key with a yellow lanyard around it. You must keep the key with the yellow lanyard with you at all times or risk having someone break into your safe. While we were at the resort, several friends of mine as well as other people staying at the resort had issues with things going missing from the room and one couple who had forgot their safe key in the room had all of their valuables removed from the safe. While on the whole, the staff at the Riu were great, I didn't let any housekeeping staff into my room after the third day as there were simply way too many stories of theft from the room and safes to feel comfortable with them in the room. One more thing about the rooms... the bathrooms are not particularly private, which for many isn't a problem, but if you are travelling with someone you don't know well or are newly intimate with, be prepared for some awkward moments. The bathroom area is sectioned off with drapes. There is a shower with a small curtain and a toilet area with a slatted door. The area with the vanity is also where the closet, safe, fridge, and liquor dispenser are located. Therefore, it can be very difficult to get around the room without seeing someone in the shower or hearing them in the bathroom. Again, not a problem for everyone, but something friends and business travellers should be aware of. POOL The pool is quite large and divided into two areas with two separate swim up bars. In an odd twist, you can smoke in the pool's swim up bars, so fortunate for smokers, and be aware if you're sensitive to smoke. Unfortunately, there isn't really a non-children's area so you will occasionally be sitting at the pool bar with an eight year old getting lemonade. This can be uncomfortable at times. There are plenty of chaise lounges and shaded areas to sit comfortably as well as two pool bars with stools and a sitting area. The entertainment area is also located beside the pool, so there is plenty of room to get comfortable with a group of people if you aren't inclined to sit by the pool. There are also vendors selling merchandise along the pool area, however they are very respectful and do not badger you (unless you linger for too long!) into buying anything. The games by the pool are typical cheesy resort fare but can be amusing to watch if you're bored of your magazine or iPod. As with any resort, people put their towels down early to claim the best seats so be aware that you should put your towel down before 7 am if you intend on getting a prime position by the pool. NOTE FOR PARENTS: This resort caters to a lot of Europeans and a great deal of the women choose to sunbathe topless at the pool. This is common at the hotel and they will not be asked to put on their tops. I didn't find it uncomfortable but I'm used to this practice at other European and Caribbean hotels, so if you are not, be aware and please be respectful. BEACH The beach is absolutely gorgeous and well kept. There are resort staff everywhere cleaning out the cups, cigarette butts, and other garbage in the area. There is no seaweed, the water is crystal clear, and it was the perfect temperature. There are a lot of water sports, boats, and jet skis in the water, so be aware and be careful. There are a ton of chaise lounges at the beach as well so there shouldn't be a problem finding a spot in the sun or shade. There is no beach bar, so you will need to bring your drinks down from the pool bar which can be a pain. The beach at night is a very different story though. The beach is not lit, which makes you an easy target for muggers, drug dealers, and other unsavoury types at night. You are putting yourself at risk if you choose to go to the beach at night and the hotel is not liable for what happens to you down there. Please be safe. Also, due to the beach erosion, much of the sand in the water was moved on to the beach. This has caused a number of sharks to lose their homes and they come in very close to shore at night. Most of these are nurse sharks (harmless) but I saw several sharks when in the water later in the evening and I was very close to shore, so be careful. ENTERTAINMENT The entertainment is very typical, cheesy resort fare. There is a Michael Jackson show that is amusing in an ironic sense and I actually enjoyed the Classic Hits night, but for the most part you won't miss anything if you skip the entertainment. One of the enjoyable parts of the entertainment is mingling with other people at the resort. The entertainment area is outdoors, which makes it easy to move from table to table, chatting with other people. I found the people at the resort to be very enjoyable. NIGHTLIFE (Otherwise known as going to the Riu Tequila) After the entertainment, the Riu Yucatan becomes a ghost town. After 12 am, the only bar that is open at the resort is the lobby bar and it doesn't offer much in the way of ambiance (or music). All of the nightlife is located at the Riu Tequila, which is about a 3 minute walk from the Riu Yucatan. There are two bars open at night at the Tequila: The Sports Bar and the Disco. The disco opens at 11:30 and for the most part is absolutely brutal. The decor looks like a 12 year old's birthday party, the dance floor is horrendous, and the service at the bars may be the worst at any Riu resort I've ever been to. The music is terrible and may actually just be someone's iPod. The music skipped and would be replayed and no one really wanted to dance. It was AWFUL. The Sports Bar is a different story. While I wouldn't suggest hanging out inside of the sports bar, it does offer some fantastic opportunities. The bar itself is a typical, sterile sports bar with some games, a couple of pool tables, televisions, some snacks, and the bar. (if you've ever been to a Riu, you know exactly what this bar looks like) However, the bar is well-stocked, have 100s of different shots and drinks to be made, and is generally run by a very great guy named Reynaldo. Reynaldo works the 12am-8am shift most nights and is a very affable, polite guy. If you throw him a few dollars at the beginning of the evening, he will be sure to have your drinks filled by the time you've finished your last one and will be only too happy to make you whatever drink you desire, even if it's 6 mojitos and a dozen shots at 4 am. He does everything with a smile and a great attitude (if you're also polite and give a decent tip). Take the drinks you get at the sports bar outside where you will find a great patio area. This is where the most fun can be had. People generally just gravitate towards this area as it is outside of both the disco and the sports bar. It turns into a patio bar of sorts and you can continue to mingle, dance, and party until the sun rises (as we did many times). If you are looking for a big party or clubs, head down to 5th Avenue in Playa Del Carmen (also very safe) and head to Senor Frogs or Coco Bongos or the other great options available in the city. You will not find good clubbing at the Riu. Period. FOOD I certainly don't go on vacation to eat a lot, but the food at the Riu Yucatan was absolutely unforgivable. If everything else at the hotel is an outdated 5 star (that's being generous probably), the food is no better than a 3 star hotel. We chose to avoid the a la cartes as a friend of mine was very ill from the sushi on the first night and we were told that the Mexican restaurant was questionable at best. The buffets were considerably worse than your average Ponderosa. The breakfast was highlighted by underdone eggs, bacon that looked like a pile of congealed fat, semi-raw potatoes, yogurt that looked like it had turned, and the most egregious sin: the only milk available for coffee was completely unrefrigerated and had turned by the time I had got to breakfast in the mornings. On the patio they have a machine with warm milk that hasn't turned, so if you need a coffee with milk, go there. The one saving grace are the fresh fruit juices which are plentiful, interesting, and offer a lot of energy for the mornings. (My personal favourite was melon) The lunch buffet was a pile of fat and starch. There would be huge tubs of hamburgers and hot dogs that looked like had been microwaved from the night before. There were tons of pizzas that were actually pretty decent, making them just about the only thing I ever really ate. Most of the other options were either fish fried into obscurity or semi-Mexican dishes that offered no flavour whatsoever. The Mexican rice was the most bland thing I had ever tasted. The vegetables were all salted for some reason, making them seem like a less healthy option than normal. The dinner buffet was more of the same. There would be theme nights where you would get a special drink before dinner, which was the only palatable thing available. The dinner buffet had more starch and fat, pizza, a carving station (which was just about the only decent thing I ate all week), and Mexican dishes that were so disappointing that I couldn't hide my disbelief. The chicken quesadillas were nothing more than a piece of tortilla filled with cheese and folded. No chicken, no spices, and the cheese had often congealed by the time it was eaten. The nachos were soggy, there were very few other options that hadn't been fried into an unrecognizable state, and in general was just bad. While this doesn't seem like a big deal, when you are planning on climbing ruins and sitting in 45 degree heat every day, it's really hard to do so when you are living off a diet of french fries, pizza, and salty carrots. One last complaint: the service in the dining room was atrocious. 90% of the time, my friend and I would have to walk to the servers station and pour our own water and wine because the server would never make it around. The tables were never reset so if you got to dinner late, it was very difficult to find a clean table with cutlery. If you care about your food at all, just go off resort or to the deli in the compound. You will pay money, but at least you will feel full. EXCURSIONS The excursions that are available through the hotel and tour operators are fantastic. I've taken optional excursions in over a dozen countries and I have rarely found such value as I did in Mexico. Our two main excursions were to Chichen Itza and Coba, both Mayan ruins. Both trips were between $100-$125 cdn and offered a motor coach to the sites, a fully guided tour, lunch, and trip to a cenote, which are underground fresh water rivers and are some of the most amazing swimming locations in the world. The sites were both magnificent, however if you want to climb a ruin, you must do so before October. Coba is the last site to allow full climbs on the ruins and they will be shutting them down soon for safety and restoration purposes. If you go to Chichen Itza, beware. Most places at Chichen Itza do not accept credit cards. At the restaurant, you must pay for water and other drinks and they only accept cash. I had to scramble to find a bank machine to buy a bottle of water, so make sure you come with cash. SHOPPING I did very little shopping on this vacation, however, I would certainly suggest that you barter. Even in the nicest shops, prices are much higher than they should be and you will be able to get almost every retailer to give you a discount. Don't take no for an answer, and if they are adamant, go somewhere else. There are very few unique purchases in Playa Del Carmen or at the ruins, so make sure you comparison shop to get the best deal. CONCLUSION I would give the Riu Yucatan a 3 1/2 star rating. The only reason it has a five star rating is because it is associated with the Riu brand. However, the hotel is very well kept, the service is top notch for the most part, and the beaches are gorgeous and welcoming. The resort is also very safe with minimal intrusions from people trying to sell you things. I would recommend this resort only if you are going as a leisure vacation and this isn't a big holiday for you. If you can get a great deal, take it. Otherwise, I would either try to find one of the Iberostar properties or (if you don't mind crossing the street to get to the beach), stay at the Riu Tequila which has had the rooms updated, key card systems put in place, and a much safer room safe. (It also has the late night bars!) If you have any other questions, feel free to message me!

The food is average , out of the buffet most of it is tasteless, any dairy based food best avoided, its manegable though and some stuff is nice kind of lile a college canteen. Some stuff nice but mostly tasteless, The steak house is pretty good though. The drinks are bad, one warm beer , plastic glasses that don't always look clean, an array of cocktails to choose from but in reality the same sugary crap, you could only drink one or two as they were all incredibly sugary , never very cold and the mixers taste abysmal. one night I asked for a shot of smirnoff no ice, no mixer , it was not smirnoff, if you are planning on enjoying a few quality drinks you will be dissapointed with the all inclusive in this regard, fine for college studenst maybe but not for anyone who expects the same standard as you get in the U.S and most of Europe, you can go up to playa del carmen and get decent drink there, they do not serve Corona on the resort and you can only get a bottle of beer in the room. Of course it all depends on your standards, some seem happy enough with the food and drink but if you want to enjoy quality food and drink and you have experienced this to a decent standard , you will not get it here, you will not go hungry but don't expect anything great ( for the price you probably shouldnt anyway) Other issue was that the food hall beside the pool stank from time to time, menus were often stained from previous uses and the soda and water dispenser dispensed flat tasteless and warm soda which did not seem right to drink as a result I often drink a beer with my lunch, again if you have standards you would prefer something a bit better. The staff are very nice and should be tipped as it goes along way for them and they are hardworking people who deserve a tip. The beach is very nice but I would love to see the food and drinks to a higher standard and some imporvements in cleaniness which in my view could be achieved for a moderate increase in price , which would be well worth it if you want a bit of quality.

I would recommend bringing lots of small change from home for tipping because the front desk rarely had small bills to break our $20 US or $500 pesos. Food: We both enjoyed the food but we mostly stuck to the mexican food which which was great. The american food was just ok. The only complaint we had was there was a \"late snack bar\" which only opened at 10 pm and it served reheated left over lunch and stale hotdogs. You would be better off bringing snacks from home to eat in your room if you get the munchies late at night. Rooms: Just ok. Beds are really hard and the rooms are soooo damp! Our sheets and clothes felt like they were wet all the time. The king size bed is just two double beds pushed together which I didn't like at all. This was probably the weakest part of the resort.

No matter how many people are at the bar your drink will always be refilled. The beach is a post card view with white sands and clear sea. It\u2019s like stepping into a warm bath and your average man can walk out pretty far before the sea covers your shoulders. It was my first time visiting Mexico and I can see why so many choose it for their holidays. You can do as little or as much as you like. You can get involved in endless activities and trips or simply lay back and enjoy the heat and the bar. The nightly entertainment was your average singing and dancing and even though at times wasn\u2019t the greatest you never saw the same show twice. As a guest at the Yucatan you have access to the other Riu hotels on the complex where you can use your all inclusive privileges. Overall I would definitely recommend the Riu Yucatan to anyone. Any bad reviews from people in my opinion are expecting far too much. If you want 5* then pay for it. If you\u2019re happy to go to a great hotel in a great location with great facilities and food then this is the place for you.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Exeter, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cRIU NOT\u201d", "Author": "Keefie_11", "ReviewID": "UR110562776", "Content": "This was a 5 star Hotel with 3 Star clients I am afriad.

I was traveling with my family which was my mum, dad and my older sister and my mum and dad shared a room and me and my sister shared a room. First time staying at RIU! Getting Here! When we got into the actual playacar resort area my whole family was amazed on how clean and well kept and safe it was. Then we got to the hotel and the lobby just looked amazing nothing like we've seen before. We were greeted with drinks and then we got our keys to our room and got checked in. Room! Got into the room and it was very lovely. The quality of the room did not really bother us that much i know some people moaned about the rooms but at the end of the day we are only sleeping there. The mini bar was not stocked properly neither was my mums and dads one in there room so we called the reception and they sent someone straight away and got it sorted. Also the reception staff were very nice when we checked in. We got fresh towles everyday and had no problems. Grounds! The grounds were lovely and so open. some people were moaning about the animals walking around everywhere but we're in mexico after all its is built on a ungle so what do you expect. Got lots of pictures of monkeys and other animals and other people and kids seemed to really enjoy having the animals there. Pool! The pool was ok and decent enough but i guess the beach made up for it. We did stay on the beach for a few days but for the rest of the holiday we stayed by the pool as that was where all the entertaiment was and me and my family like to get involed and have a laugh but if you want something quiter stay by the beach. The entertaiment...well it defiently kept you entertained throughout the day. WARNING!! If you want to reserve a sun lounger by the pool then you have to wake up very early. On the first couple of days we were there my dad got up at about 7 and then realised that most of the chairs were taken so he woke up at 6:30 and again not alot chairs left, so my dad ended up waking up at 5:30!!! just to reserve sun loungers and he was not the only one, my dad said that everyone morning there would be a group of people up at 5:30 in the morning reserving sun loungers (mainly men, obviously the wives have sent them there lol). Beach! Beautiful the ebst we've seen, very clean too and its much more easier to get a chair there than the pool. The people selling watersports can get a bit annoying sometimes and some do annoy you everyday! My dad decided to go on the jetski, so my dad paid and all that blah blah but this is what they do not tell before you pay, if you fall off the jetski you have to pay $50. hmmm a bit sneaky if you ask me but luckly my dad did not fall off the jetski. Entertaiment at night Very butlins style but hey if your from england then you wont complain we certaintly did not. The Michael Jackson was the best out of all the shows. we did not see all the shows as we did go out some nights as some get boring after a while. Staff Very nice and friendly. Was a bit suprised that even when my sister was wearing the blue wristband(which means she is under 18) some staff still flirted with her. The Animation team are very nice and defiently made the holiday for us. Food Right this is the down point of holiday. the food was not that nice but it werent bad as we ate it for 2 weeks. Same food nearly every night and rarely on some nights there was something different in the dinner buffet. The el la carte restauarants were rele bad. The Chinese or japenses restuarant did not even have noodles!! I thought this was a staple in asian cooking!!. The american steak house was probably the best. Not impressed with the starters like the ceaser salad which was a few bits of lettuce withdressing and 4 bits of bread squares on top. The Mexican was the worst. I though i would be the best as we are in MEXICO!! but no flavour in the food at all so bland. Lunch was pretty much the same all the time. Drinks machines were ok i got a cup of tea everyday (true brit). The cocktails etc were great. Go to the pool bar right by where the lunch is usually held and go and see carlos--- a legend. Overall great holiday considering going back next year but might stay at RIU palace for better food. also if anyone thats been to jamaica can you send me a message as we are thinking about going there too.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery Unpleasant experience, not a reflection of RIU standards\u201d", "Author": "YF13", "ReviewID": "UR109828276", "Content": "We were at this resort a two week stay and we both wished we could come back within the third day!!!! The resort is in the middle of a jungle and really closed in with lots of trees and wild animals. There was no air circulation even in the main lobby. When we got there, as we started walking to our room, we saw all sorts of wild animals; monkeys ( about 150 throughout resort), snakes, strange looking racoons, aglie long legged (there were tons of them looked like over grown rats), & peacocks crossing the pathways. The walkways were very dirty because of the animals. We were told that the monkeys would stay in the many trees close to the main lobby, not true, one morning 6:00 a.m. the largest monkey and another 12 monkeys made their way to the trees outside the rooms and it just happened to be our room, they were very loud and then we heard them above our room on the roof. I know they are only monkeys, but at the end of the day, they are still wild animals from the jungle. Nowhere in the travel brochures does it make mention that you would be living with wild animals during your stay. The hotel staff were great, the entertainment staff were friendly and did an excellent job with the evening shows. The food was not up to the RIU standards. We saw bugs around the fruit stand during breakfast, the variety of food was not there, they served the same thing every day, it got tiring after a few days. Out of the three a la carte restaurants, we only enjoyed the Chineese one. We walked out of the the Steakhouse................... Once the weekend came, there were a lot of Mexican's that vacationed at the resort and on those days, there was more varieties of foods, VERY STRANGE...................... The main dining room was set up like a lecture hall, the tables were attached to one another and you had no room to even get out of your chair or privacy for a conversation. The cieling fans were so filled with dust that we had a health concern with the dust following on the food. We mentioned that we were celebrating a birthday and our anniversary and the hotel made no effort in acknowledging this at all.............................. Our room was really run down, damp, and hot, the a/c was not strong at all and you needed to keep the cieling fan on to get the air circulating, it was not condusive for sleeping with air blowing on you...........the electrical plug was out of the wall. The maids did a great job in cleaning the room and there were clean towels every day. The soft drinks including water was only refilled every two days, we had to constantly go to the front desk to get a bottle of water. There are two main pools, on for water sports and the other for lazing around and a whirlpool. It seemed that the mothers and their kids took control of the whirlpool and the mothers were letting their kids wee wee in the whirlpool so of course we did not go in the whilpool. These same mothers were bringing their kids to the main pool to go wee wee, this is completely unaccepable and nothing was said by the hotel staff. I realize that this is a sensitive issue but it is also a health issue. If you did not get by the pool before 6:00 a.m. you were unable to get a chair. As the RUI Tequilla resort had not beach, everyone came over to this resort so even the chairs on the beach were occuplied, this is not fair to the guests who stayed at this resort..............

We are a couple in our early 30's and we took our 3 year old daughter. The hotel was great. Its the first Riu hotel we've stayed in and we would definately use them again. It was like staying in a nature park - there were animals evrywhere you looked - monkeys, aguti, lizards, birds, peacocks, squirrels! We stayed in the 4000 block, which is near the pool and beach. It wasn't right next to the main hotel/restaurants but it took literally a few minutes to walk there and it was so lovely in the hotel grounds it was lovely to walk there each day. The staff were really friendly - couldn't do enough to help. The atmosphere was just so chilled and exactly what it should be on holiday. The rooms were great. Yes the beds are quite firm but not uncomfortable - unless you like very soft beds. We had no problem sleeping, apart from my 3 year old snoring next to me. :) The pool was great, cocktails in the pool - can't beat it! with music playing,and some activities if you wanted to join in, but no pressure if you didn't. The beach....wow! Pure white soft sand! Turquoise sea! Heaven! Only downside i would say was the water was quite choppy. But can't have everything hey! You could use the other Riu's nearby. we only used the Tequila who have a lovely pool, and it was a little quieter there, probably as people all went to the beach. So if there were no sunbeds next to our pool, then there were usually some there. There were always beds available on the beach. Plenty of palm trees to shade under if needed...and yes you will need some shade. HOT is not the word! It was a little windy at times on the beach which is quite deceiving when you're sunbathing, so to have a palm tree to sit under is a nice break from the sun. The food was nice. Lots of variety. Yes it was typical all inclusive food, pizza, chips, salad etc but also there was mexican food and stews and pasta etc. It took a good while before it felt repetitive. The sightseeing is great too. Nearby there's Crocoun Zoo - a must!!! A personal guided tour round the zoo and you can hold baby crocodiles and snakes, and hand feed monkeys and deer. It was amazing!!! Also Xcaret was an experience! A bit of everything - zoo / nature park / archaeological sight / aquarium / butterfly house / beach - a gorgeous one at that! / underground rivers you can snorkel round. Also Chichen Itza is definately worth a look, and of course swimming with Dolphins! FANTASTIC!!!!!!! I can't put into words how much we enjoyed, loved, were amazed by this holiday!!!!!!!

I read the reviews before we left and after we returned home and while we share similar views to much of what has been said already, everyone is different and will have had different experiences. The hotel is nice, large lobby, lovely and well kept grounds and pool. We were impressed at check in, though slightly less after we saw our room. Nothing special, clean enough (except stains on the bed base and sheets) and adequate for the time we planned to spend in it. The rooms do look dated and a little paint and some new furniture would work wonders. The gardens are well maintained, we saw them being pruned and tidied daily and there is a lot of wildlife in the grounds such as monkeys, lizards, coati and aguti that made for some interesting photo's and enhanced the exotic feeling of the resort. We mostly ate at the buffet restaurant, but also managed to visit the speciality restaurants. The main buffet offers a wide variety of food, everything from Mexican to burgers, salads, roast beef, pork etc. Often it was similar but there was at least one new dish to try every night. If you like to try new things now is the time (fried ice cream, anyone?), if not there is still plenty to suit all taste buds. The only criticism here would be breakfast. Tasty but repetitive. You need to be up early to be in with a chance to book the speciality restaurants Over the course of our stay we managed to book a table at the steakhouse and Asian and two visits to the Mexican. All lovely but the steakhouse was my favourite. worth getting up at 6am! A lot of people have said the drinks are weak or watered down,but I can't say that we experienced that. There is lots of different alcohols and cocktails to try, and if you want anything in particular made just ask. Our favourite barman was Benito. Not only was he friendly and efficient, man could he mix a drink! We chatted with him at the bar and he would never let us sit with an empty glass (this often resulted in us having two drinks in front of us at the same time!) ask him for a Mexican lindo or a tequila boom boom. Watch out for his practical jokes! The staff here are friendly and they work hard, although you do find that some expect tips even if it isn't merited. The daily entertainment eg shooting, waterpolo etc is enjoyable, the evening entertainment is good, if you like to watch people dance. A singer wouldn't go amiss as dancing every night gets tedious.. I can't comment on the maids/ mini bar staff. The first three days were fine and we left tips on the bed for the decorations they made us, but on the fourth day we returned from a trip to find that someone had rifled through our drawers, bags and wardrobe, checking in our shoes, pockets and UNDERWEAR for valuables! We had a small amount of Pesos stolen, less than \u00a320 and it was our own fault for leaving it in the drawer instead of locking it up, however the fact that someone had gone through our belongings was enough for me to ask to be moved room and keep our 'do not disturb' sign on for the remainder of the holiday. This invasion probably ruined the trip for me. The matter was dealt with by management and we were given champagne as a goodwill gesture, but I believe we weren't the only couple that had items removed from their room. USE THE SAFE! The hotel is right on the beach, but watch where you step, there is a fair bit of litter in the sand such as cigarette ends, straws etc, particularly near the stairs. Walk about ten minutes along the beach, past the hotels and it is much nicer. There is a shopping area 5 mins walk from the hotel and Playa Del Carmen is a 45 minute walk (not recommended if it's too hot!)

The daily 'merengue' warming up song started to annoy us as we went through our holiday but by day 10 i was joining in with the whoop whoop chorus much to the surprise of my wife! My only criticism has to be pointed at the guys who try and sell trips on behalf of scubacaribe. I did cave in quite early and go out on a waverunner (jetski) which was cool but the guys don't let up when they're trying to sell you outings.

We had so much fun!!! The weather was amazing, hot every day...it maybe rained once for an hour or so, but that was in the evening when we were eating dinner. We stayed at the Riu Yucatan which was a great resort. The rooms were a little dated, but we were barely in our rooms. We enjoyed this hotel because we could walk across the street to the Riu Tequilla and eat at the restaurants there, check out their shows and party at their disco. The Tequilla also has a 24 hour sports lounge which was very usefull. It has about 7 computers which are maybe $1 for 15 mins. So when we wanted a pina coldada and wanted to check facebook at 3 am we could! Our hotel was in a great location. We never walked into town (cause it was too hot) but to cab there it is a flat rate of $5. Downtown Playa del Carmen is so amazing. There are tons of restaurants and bars. We ate at a restaurant on the beach, didn't even look at the prices, and when our bill came it was VERY expensive. I'm guessing its because of the location. So the next time we ate in town we just went to some \"hole in the wall\" paid $10 for both our meals and had amazing authentic Mexican cuisine. I'd say the best part of our trip was our day trip to Cozumel. You can catch a ferry from Playa del Carmen (25 min ride) for maybe $25 total for 2 people. Once across we rented a scooter and drove around the island. It took us about 3 hours to drive all the way around. Thats with stopping for some sightseeing and shots of tequilla. But I definitely recommend going to Cozumel and renting scooters. Such a great experience! All in all we enjoyed our vacation, the hotel was great.

First the good points. The hotel lobby is very grand and creates a very good first impression, lots of big armchairs and a nice bar area. The grounds are the best i have ever seen at a hotel, lush vegatation with palm trees that really give a jungle feeling and it is very clean. The food is also very good , plenty of choice and regularly replenished so its always fresh, you really would have to be unbelievably fussy not to find something to like. The beach is incredible,beautiful white sand leading down to warm turquoise water and again it is very clean with plenty of sunbeds. The pool area is also very nice but we did find the pool too warm with too many loud Americans so only spent one hour there but that was ok because the beach is so great. The wildlife on the grounds is great, too much to list. The staff at the hotel are mostly fantastic, so happy, friendly and helpful. Now the BAD points. There is no way that the Yucatan can be classed as a 5 star in my opinion, not even a 4 star in my opinion. It is a nice 3 star in lovely grounds. If when i booked our trip it had been sold as a 3 star i would have been very happy but it is sold as a 4/5 star so you are soon dissappointed. As an example, the room is so dated that when we turned a light switch on we got electric shocks, the shower curtain was hanging off the rail, the bedclothes were stained, plaster was falling from the ceiling, the tv had no reception (didn't want to watch tv but it's mean't to be 5 star!!), there's mould in the shower and then theres the doors , they are on a spring so whenever anybody in the neighbouring rooms enters or leaves the doors bang shut. These are all small things but not when you are supposedly paying for 5 star. The Hotel is All Inclusive but be sure to take plenty of money for your nightly tipple as the drink at the bars are awful, the Lager like all the soft drinks is flat,warm and so watered down its a joke, if you like Vodka ask for Smirnoff as they hide it under the bar and give out cheap gross vodka instead. The hotel entertainment (i use the word entertainment very loosely) consists of the 'Entertainment Crew' dancing and miming to CDs. I recommend getting a taxi to 5th Avenue and enjoying great drinks and live bands etc instead of the hotel torture but then doesn't that defeat the object of All Inclusive ? In concluding, i would say if you can get a good deal and don't expect luxury, you will have a great time.

The bar staff were quick and friendly and made some marvellous cocktails, I would highly reccomend the Pina Coladas. The entertainment staff were excellent, some of the games played at poolside were great fun and the evening entertainments were very good. As with all great holidays the poolside and beach were an absolute joy. I think I can safely say that I have never enjoyed a beach and the sea quite as much as I did here, not too crowded, lovely soft white sand and the sea temperature and colour were just about perfect. I am pretty confident that almost every member of our party will visit Riu Yucatan again, an oustanding hotel in a fantastic resort.

We booked it fairly last-minute as we managed to get a good deal, recommended by an independent travel agent, and we agreed that it should be good as it's a RIU hotel. I'd read the odd bad review here (as with all hotels) and I'm glad I ignored them and went for it. THE STAFF - were excellent. This was my third trip to the Caribbean, and the staff here were the best, in particular the most friendly. The Mayans always seem to be smiling, especially the bar staff, and even the maid! They cannot do enough for you, honestly. Even though we varied our drinks at the swim-up bar, and the guy there was non-stop busy he made our drinks up even before we asked for them, and we didn't have to tip to get this service! At all bars the staff were very quick to serve us, it was great. THE FOOD - was very good. A bit better than other buffet restaurants I've eaten in, and beautifully presented, with fruit sculptures ets, and constantly restocked, serving spoons renewed etc. Breakfast there was not only Continental style meats & cheeses, cooked bacon, sausage and eggs in all styles, pancakes/waffles etc, pastries, a huge range of breads to toast if you liked, cereals, fresh fruits, porridge, but also salads and mexican dishes like nachos and hot sauces! Lunch we only ate in the pool-side restaurant,(the Steak-House a-la-carte) and again a great choice of soup, stews, hot meats and fish, some chinese-style, vegetables, rice and pasta, fantastic salads, pizzas (not great) fries and fresh fruits and desserts. There were also burgers and hot-dogs in the one next door (the Mexican a-la-carte). Dinner we only ate in the main buffet once and it was a similar range to the lunch menu but more extensive. We had no problem at all booking the a-la-carte restaurants, though we did it between 7.00 and 7.30 as that was when we were having breakfast. The Mexican we tried first and were disappointed. The starters are done buffet-style, and you have a choice of three main-course and two desserts I think. The main-course was average (mine was luke-warm, probably as they seem to wait to serve everyone's at the same time) and the dessert was nice. I just felt it lacked atmosphere, it was quiet and there was no music, but that's just me being fussy. Try it, if you don't like it you can still go to the buffet restaurant after to eat! The Steak-House was also just so-so, with limited choice. The Asian was nice, I somehow persuaded my husband to try it as they had sushi/sashimi on the menu, which I love but he hates! As it is all buffet-style here though he had lots of starters and main meals to choose from, and he loved these so much we went again the following night! THE DRINKS - Again very good, some named drinks like Bacardi, Jim Beam etc (which I discovered is a good alternative to my normal Jack Daniels!), and all served with a smile. The beer is weak and watery, my husband felt, though he likes stronger beers. The cocktails we drank mostly at the swim-up bars in the day were lovely but usually full of ice and weak, though it wasn't our intention to get drunk in the day, and we spent a lot of time here! The hotel did seem quite full, and one or two days one swim-up bar got quite full and a bit rowdy for a while, but that was the worst thing all holiday, so not much to complain about. THE ROOM - I'd emailed prior and asked for a ground-floor, centrally located room, and that was what I was given! We were in block 5, very close to the pool and beach access, and not far at all from the main restaurant/reception. Yes, the decor is a little tired, but the bed is huge, the room and bathroom is very clean, and the shower is brilliant, great pressure and as hot as you like! The mini-bar is great, as are the spirits on optics. The maid came every day to change towels, make-up the beds etc, and gave us great towel-art daily, even without being tipped! THE BEACH- One of the best beaches in The Caribbean I'd say, which is why we chose to go here. The first couple of days were very windy so the sea was choppy, but that couldn't be helped. There were plenty of sunbeds here, though not that much shade, so if you need shade (If you have young children for example) , get down there fairly early and reserve one under the palm trees near the back. It was clean and pretty litter free, except for cigarette ends! Why can't you smokers dispose of them properly ?!?! THE POOLS- Again, kept very clean, tested regularly. My only niggle is that they could do with another one maybe, and it would be good if they kept one pool just for children (or at least restrict them just to one of the pools). I have children myself, but they are older now and we take these holidays to totally relax, and having them running and jumping in etc all the time can be a bit annoying. Having one pool child-free would be nice, that's'all. SUNBEDS - There are simply not enough of them. On the first day we frowned at people having reserved them with towels by 8am, but when we tried to get one to lie on in the afternoon and there weren't any left we realised that we had to do the same! Please get some more sunbeds Riu Yucatan! THE ENTERTAINMENT - There always seemed to be something going on all day and night. The daytime centred around the pool from about 10am til 5pm, and the music was LOUD! If you don't like loud music best lie on the beach, or maybe find a quieter hotel? The night-time entertainment seemed geared mainly towards the children but was varied and good quality, with great dancing, costumes etc, though not for me. All in all we had a great holiday. The Riu Yucatan is a well-run Hotel where the staff seem to value and enjoy their jobs. The food and drink is great, the pool is great, the beach is amazing.

We arrived at the hotel around 8:30pm on a Friday and one of the members of our group's bag did not arrive with us on the bus. The Yucatan staff and Sunwing employees were very helpful and assured us that the bag would be found. Within one hour of arrival the missing bag showed up which was a weight off our shoulders. The resort grounds are beautiful, they are spotless and have plenty of wildlife roaming around, yes including cockraoches, but it is Mexico, what do you expect? The buildings are dated but they are still very nice and there is no reason to complain. The rooms are comfortable, they aren't huge but you aren't there to spend all day in your room. The beds are hard but it really isn't so uncomfortable that you cannot sleep. There is limited privacy when it comes to the bathrooms but it was really quite charming and I really didn't mind it. The pools and beach area are absolutely incredible. The pools are clean and there are plenty of lounging chairs and shade to find. The beach is huge with nice white sand and a limitless amount chairs and palm trees for shade. The food at the buffet is good. There is a lot to choose from including foods from various different countries. Lots of fresh fruit and veggies as well. The Asian a la carte was a little bit disappointing as it was also a buffet, the food was good but it would have been nice tho have had a meal that was made for you. We went back to the main buffet the following evening and they had the same foods there as they had at the Asian buffet.

The room was very spacious, clean and the bonus of our own Optics was a nice touch, there wasn't any sea/pool views from our room but as we hardly spent any time there it wasn't an issue, the trees outside provided a very private balcony! The Beach although without plenty of designated shade was compensated with the number of Palm Trees especially by the Watersport Centre which had a large group of Palms to give adequate and most welcome shade. This area also benefited from the Breeze from the sea to give some relief from the heat, the pool area received little wind and was always very hot.

Booked with Thomson and flew non-stop from Birmingham (UK) airport, about 11 hours there, 9and a half hours back. We booked this holiday about 4 months ago, however as always the reviews that followed were very mixed and mainly on the negative side, sorry to say but the bad ones were mainly from the US and Canadian travellers. With that said we all should realise that the \u2018Star Rating\u2019 on hotels abroad differ greatly from country to country. Being realistic, when i booked the \u2018Yucatan\u2019 for the money i paid it was pretty obvious that I was not booking into a \u20185 Star Luxury resort\u2019 hence the fact that \u2018Rui\u2019 have Palaces for extra luxury, but you will pay a lot more that comfort. So bear in mind, the reviews that keep harping an about \u2018it\u2019s not 5 star, are to be taken with a pinch of salt, in my opinion, it\u2019s a good 3+/4 hotel, excellent value for money., Now for the honest and fair review, just to paint the picture we are a couple in our late thirties, we love a nice beach, relaxation, not big drinkers and a bit of comfort and are fully aware of what we get for our money. We flew with Thompson\u2019s and decided to splash out on the \u2018Premium Upgrade\u2019; again after reading the reviews about upgrades, it really is a personal choice. Would i do it again, Was it worth the money?..Yes and Yes, without a doubt. No queuing at the Airport either end for check in, a breeze,, Onto the plane, bigger seats and really good legroom, better meals, free drinks, for us it was just a lot more pleasing to sit on a plane for 11 hours, and trust me the time goes a lot quicker if you\u2019re comfortable..Arrived at Cancun airport, no problem, quick, smooth and easy, same for the transfer to resort, it takes about 1 hour 20 mins to get to resort, nice enough journey though. We arrived at the hotel which is located within the gated community of \u2018Playacar\u2019. The whole area of \u2018Playacar\u2019 is secure, extremely safe and very clean and well maintained. Within this gated area are most of the hotels (about 12), the majority are all on the beach and there are also private condos, as stated the whole area is really safe and well presented. The hotel has a massive open entrance and looks quite impressive, very clean and inviting. Check in no problems, a nice drink whilst be given a few basic indicators on the hotel, then the \u2018bellboys take your cases to the room. Just a mention here on the tipping situation, we took \u2018Pesos\u2019 with us which is fine, so we tipped in \u2018Pesos\u2019 20 (\u00a31 roughly) 0r 50 pesos (2.50 roughly) but you can and a lot do take American dollars, contrary to what you are told here in the UK, they do accept willingly the American dollar and Thompson do there for the trips as well. We did tip but it\u2019s not expected but hey if you get good service from someone, a little reward goes a long way. We were situated in Block 4000, this block was right by one of the pools and we were on the ground floor. The blocks are only 3 storeys high so no great walks for anyone. None of the rooms have sea views, some have partial pool view but they all have a balcony and from what we saw all the rooms look out onto well maintained and pleasant looking gardens. You also get to see the hotels wildlife, consisting of the little \u2018Gritter\u2019 type animal which are everywhere, also the Howler Monkeys which you can\u2019t fail to miss if there outside your room lol and the lovely looking \u2018Racoon\u2019 type animals that roam around. You will see everyone walking around with their cameras taking pics of the wildlife; it\u2019s nice to see it. The other creatures you will see a fair few of are the reptiles and lizards, there nice and big and roam around freely. I must admit my first impressions were really good, the place looked really clean and fresh looking, the buildings and corridors were spotless. Arrived at the room, Nice and big, 2 big beds, good storage space, sliding doors to the balcony, air con (worked well), old style telly but did the job, for the short time we watched it.. I thought the layout of the rooms worked well, curtains led to a decent bathroom were there was a double wardrobe with a safe to use. The safe was a decent size and you will be given the key on arrival. The shower is a walk in one, and really powerful, no problems with hot water at all. The bathroom area houses the mini fridge and the drinks optics, the fridge is topped up every other day and there is an ice bucket as well. The ice machine is in the corridor, another nice touch. The maids do a great job on a daily basis cleaning the rooms, we tipped on a regular basis, as in our view they deserved it. They also leave animals out of towels, I won\u2019t spoil the surprises on these so I won\u2019t mention anymore. Beds firm but fairly comfy, pillows ok as well, all in all the room was of a decent standard and we were more than happy. The doors are really heavy and slam shut so sometimes if you have a selfish neighbour it could be a problem, or just take a drink from your optic and you will be that drunk you won\u2019t notice. There are 2 pools in the complex, and a pool bar in each. We tended to stay around the pool farthest from the beach; we found this one quieter and less busy. There are activities going on in the other pool which are there if you want them, none of the entertainment are pushy though, they are all very friendly even if you don\u2019t join in. The pools are in good condition; however there are signs of tiredness in places. Plenty of sun beds around the pools although as everywhere else, you have to be up early to bag a good pitch, having said that there is also a lot of cover around the pools so if you want a pitch in the sun most of the day you have to be up extra early.. we saw towels out as early as 5.30 and to be honest by 9ish most of them was gone.. You still get the moans from people who rise out of bed at 11 and expect to claim a prime spot round the pool, it aint gonna happen. My advice is if you want one get up like every one else and towel it.. On the flip side of this the hotel sits on a beautiful big beach, with the most sun beds I have seen at one hotel. The sand is lovely, although thanks to our smoking friends it has its fair share of cigarette butts; please smokers use something to put your butts into. The sea is lovely and warm; sometimes it has big waves which can be fun. There is a life guard there during the day and there is no one to hassle you on the beach, sometimes someone will try and sell you cigars or silver jewellery, a simple \u2018no thanks\u2019 and there gone. Staffs from the hotel try to keep the beach as tidy as possible and they do a good job, beach scores 8 out 10. Onto the food and drink subject, we are not big drinkers so I can\u2019t really comment much about the alcoholic drinks but what we had was quality. We did try a few cocktails and they were top drawer. There are drinks stations in both beach bar restaurants with wine, pop and lager pumps. The wine in not nice to be honest, the lager is ok, watered down but decent enough, the pop is ok but not that fizzy out of these dispensers so we tended to use the bars instead, having said that its still nice to have the dispensers dotted about to help yourself. My one big gripe and this is me being set in my ways, there are not enough self service coffee machines, I like a coffee when I get up and when I go to bed and you can\u2019t help yourself to one at these times, so my tip is to take your own travel kettle, just bear in mind it takes ages to boil lol.. The waiters all work hard and we had no problems getting drinks of an evening. There are numerous places to eat day and night; breakfast is served the main restaurant, the usual food on offer, good choices. In the afternoon the 2 pool/beach restaurants serve up the afternoon buffet, hot dogs, pizza, beef burgers ect.. To be brutally honest I was a bit disappointed with the standard of food and the whole set up of these 2 beach eateries, it was more of a canteen.. The lack of respect from some people didn\u2019t help, walking round with water dripping from there bikinis, arses hanging out of swim wear. It would help if the hotel just had a few respectful rules for these beach bars. The evening buffet was again in the main restaurant, good choices on offer again, not the best I\u2019ve seen but not the worse. A plus is that this restaurant opens at 6.30 through till 10.00 which is good, however we did find that after 9 a lot of the main dishes where finished, which then limited your food choices, I would also like to add that although there are a variety of dishes ect to choose from there is no children\u2019s buffet. I guess if you have kids you could struggle to keep them happy at evening meals, although there is pizza every night, lol. There are 3 speciality restaurants there, the 2 beach bar restaurants change on the night time to a Mexican restaurant, which we never tried and a steak house, which we ate in once. It was ok and a change from the buffet. The third speciality restaurant is the Asian, located up in the lobby; we ate there twice as it was nice food. Bear in mind that these are not Al la carte restaurants they are speciality restaurants that need to be booked on the day you want to go, no advance bookings. You book them in the main breakfast restaurant in the morning, sometimes there is queue, but the best day to book is on a Saturday as that seems to be a main changeover day. There is no dress code for any of the restaurants which is a bit of a shame, we did notice that the Brits made an effort dressing up a bit on the evening, but other nationalities didn\u2019t seem to bother as much. It may just be me but i think it\u2019s nice to make a bit of an effort for evening meals, albeit a nice smart pair of shorts and a shirt, Mrs. into a nice summer dress. The other picky moan I\u2019d add regarding the restaurants, especially the specialty ones is that there is no atmosphere in them, no background music just plates clanking. It was no problem but it just seemed a shame that the staff try hard in there specialty restaurants and they seem proud and happy to give you something different but a little bit of low lighting, candles and background music would make a big difference. Evening entertainment, was really good, Rui dancers every night. To be honest it\u2019s the best we have seen abroad, Grease and Michael Jackson were good but there was always something there to watch and foot tap to. Again, it won\u2019t be everyone\u2019s cup of tea but remember what you paid for the holiday and what you are getting, for me it was better than expected evening entertainment. Never really a problem getting a seat round the stage and it generally finished by 11. The Thomson welcome meeting was good, no hard or pushy sell for the trips, Wendy and May are the girls on hand to help you and they are good, they know there stuff and one of them is there all day from 8-4 which is also nice to see, well done Thompson on customer care. We did 2 trips, Xcaret which is well worth the money, great day out 20 mins from the resort by taxi and the show on the night is really good, i would say it\u2019s a must day out, especially if you have kids. The second trip we did was the dolphins, now there are loads of different trips for the dolphins and varying prices, so pick wisely. As it was my wife\u2019s birthday, we went for the \u2018Trainer for the Day\u2019 package; it was all day with a variety of different swims, with manatees, sharks, stingrays and of course the dolphins. It cost about \u00a3140 each, and what a day we had, it was excellent, well worth the money. So in short, a lovely first visit to Mexico, lovely beach, nice hotel good location, would we return? Yes but maybe to a Palace hotel next time and that\u2019s not a reflection on the Yucatan. We got good value for money there and exactly what it said on the tin so no complaints. Just to add we did walk to the Tequila and the Playacar hotel as well, both very good standard and of the same standard. The Tequila was more lively i say, but not rowdy and the Playacar was more quieter and relaxed. All three offer near enough the same and are all within a short stroll from each other so which ever you pick you will enjoy..

We stayed at the Riu Yucatan for 2 weeks from 31st March to 14th April. There was 31 of us in our group from Scotland and we came to Mexico for mine and my now husband's wedding :-) We chose the Riu chain of hotels as they have a great reputation and picked the Yucatan in particular because of its beautiful beach and sea. I can truly say that this was the best 2 weeks of my life and i think all of our group agreed. The hotel itself is in beautiful grounds and the rooms are very spacious and clean. As we were the bride and groom the hotel upgraded us to a suite which was huge!! Had double the size of balcony, a completely seperate bathroom with bath as the others only have showers closed off from the main bedroom by a curtain, a bigger bedroom and a massive seperate livingroom with couch, table etc. We were very chuffed! Oh and you get towel animals and little thank you gifts from the hotel which we all loved. Rooms cleaned every day and minibar filled every other day. The hotel is Mexican themed which some have said is old fashioned but i think it gives the hotel character and why would you go to Mexico and not want to see Mexican styled buildings and decor?! The beach is to die for. Have never seen sand so white and water so blue and clear. Total paradise. No problems getting a sunlounger no matter what time of day you go down. The pools are great too. 1 kids pool, 1 they do the water activities in and 1 for just chilling. Most sunloungers were taken around 6/7am in the morning. We noticed this when we went down to the beach for sunrise which is a must, its beautiful. Great watersports, amongst the group we went scuba diving, parasailing, kayaking, jet ski's and body boards. Oh and an important point to add about the sea is that you can stand almost right out to the rope, it doesn't suddenly drop which was great for the kids as the waves can sometimes be a bit choppy - great fun though! The entertainment team are fab, always so friendly and full of energy. They remember you too, myself and my husband were nicknamed 'White Chocolate' and 'Milky Boy' for our entire stay by Obama, one of the team. Look out for him, he's a lot of fun! Lots of activities during the day and a different show every evening, the best one being Grease by far! Also go see the fire show on the beach, its amazing! The staff are 1st class, couldn't be more helpful, nothing was too much hassle. You got a Hola from every one you walked past. Got a few courtesy calls at the room from reception, asking if everything was ok, did we need anything. Buffet restaurants in the lobby and by the pool are fantastic, something for everyone. Experienced all 3 speciality restaurants, steakhouse was the best out of the 3 but you had to book it early in the morning on that day as they can only cater for a certain number at each sitting. Waiters were always filling up your glass as soon as it was finished and water was constantly brought to your table. Excursions wise we went to Doplhinarius in Riveria Maya, a 10 minute bus ride away, to swim with the dolphins which is an unbelievable experience. Booked through Scuba Caribe, the watersports company on the beach as got a better deal than with the Thomsons rep. Also went to Xcaret, booked throught Thomson rep at hotel, which was amazing,a lot of walking but theres a lot to see and is definitely worth it. We took the ferry to Cozumel as well for the day, was a really good trip out. Playa del Carmen is only a 5 min taxi ride away and costs 70 pesos each way. A lot of shops ranging from tourist to designer on 5th Avenue. And last but not least, the wedding!! Nancy, Riu's wedding co-ordinator was great, you have a meeting with her on your first morning and go over your choices and she does everything else from there! There was no stress involved at all and everything went perfectly. It was unbelievable getting married on the beach, such a beautiful setting. Would totally recommend getting married here to anyone, you wouldn't regret it. Best day of our lives! So all in all we had a fantastic time! Hotel is suitable for all ages. We had a big group ranging from 3 to 70 and everyone loved it. Great family hotel. Brilliant fun friendly atmosphere. Hope this helps any future Riu Yucatan guests! We'll definitely be back!!

The grounds were immaculate, monkeys in the trees, pool was spotless, staff really friendly, plenty of restaurants and bars, loads of activities included during the day. Housekeeping were great, kept our room spotless everyday and topped up drinks every other day. Big rooms, dressing area and balcony, we were in room 2104 on the ground floor right near the lobby. We went to the buffet and booked the Mexican, we wern't bored after 2 weeks even being veggie there was still lots of choice. 20 min walk to PLD on the beach or 50 pesos in a taxi, lots of shops, bars, restaurants, clubs and ferry to cozumel, the whole area felt very safe and exclusive (even for us 20 year old girls). Loads of entertainment, evening show, spanish lessons and aqua gym everyday, the entertainment team were sensational and made sure we had a good time, even on nights out. Clubs - Riu tequila club is worth a visit as its all paid for, cocobongo - one night to remember and brahma. Lots of different nationalities to meet. We went when it was american spring break, but it wasnt crazy, the hotel is suitable for families, couples and friends. Cozumel is worth a visit - but dont make the mistake we did and go on a stormy day! Trips: Underwater world swimming with turtles and Jungle Maya - Alltournative, zip lining and jungle adventures, photos good value for money. Both brilliant had a great time and will review them on their page. Didnt get time for xcaret or cancun day trip but will next time. We booked with thomson in the hotel lobby, our reps were great Wendy and Mayaly were brilliant helping us with lots of questions, their knowledge is amazing and they deserve all the great comments. We are booking our trip for next year already, you will not be disapointed. Thanks to all the thomson and hotel staff that gave us a holiday of a lifetime.

The rooms are lovely and spacious - with a choice of 4 optics if you fancy some refreshment away from the bar. The fridge is well stocked every day, and if you run out of anything - just ask and they will accomodate. The beds were lovely. If your bed is too hard, they will bring a matress topper up to soften it... and if your bed is too soft - guess what? A matress topper to make it hard. The food is brilliant - my new husband and I gained weight out there, but hey thats what holidays are for! Everything behind the bar is branded - a vodkaa and coke is just that - not white spirit and rola cola like you find in other resorts. All round a brillianbt resort - I could rave all day!

Firstly I want to say I had the best 2 weeks of my life and big thank to hotel staff who made my stay amazing!! This is not the first hotel I have stayed and my review is absolutely honest!! Had so much fun in this amazing hotel! Thank you all!! LOCATION: You can't ask for better location,honestly! Beach was amazing,really big and wide. Monkeys/wildlife were superb. So many palm trees and so clean grounds. Gardeners really worked hard to keep everything nice and clean. And it took just 1 minute or even less to get to the beach from our room. You can't ask for more! Everything you needed was there. And people from Riu Tequila had to walk miles back to their hotel carring beach towels along the road. Felt sorry for them. Next time choose Yucatan..lol FOOD: During my 2 week stay I couldn't even try all that food. There was always plentyful choices!! Never felt hungry. Other way around,I ate way too much because that food was just so delicious! These omlettes/pancakes/different choices of meat/fish,smoothies in the morning /cappuchino etc. Had even no time to go to Stake house and Asian restaurant,because we preferred to visit mexican 3 times. Food there was delicoius and still couldn't try everything from the menu. Peaole who complaining about the food I dont understand,maybe you should try Riu Palace next time perhaps? ...Just wondering do you have different food options every day at home as well, to make sure you never have that same taste in your mouth?! lol DRINKS: Again way too many options on the menu etc.... Loved my margartitas/pina coladasdifferent types of tequilas, miami vice's etc. Drinks were always cold and they were so tasty and looked nice! Bar tenders were always happy to serve you and they were really fast. Never had to wait or que up for my drink for more than 1 minute. And didn't even tip them until my last day! What a service!! I was so surprised because I have read that the only way you guys told me to get my drink fast is to tip tip tip...well this rule doesn't exist in Riu YUCATAN! WOW ROOMS: Kept so clean every day. MOST COMFY BEDS I HAVE EVER SLEPT ON. Some peole complained also about pillows. Well,my pillow was comfy as ever. Even at home my own bed I don't SLEEP AS WELL AS IN THIS BED! And in your room you got mini fridge always full of drinks,and when you run out of anything just call the reception and ask for more and same day everything is being delivered. As simple as that. And tequila in your minibar was delicoius,some peole said it was undrinkable. How come this is undrinkable when they serve same tequila on the main bar for you?lol ENTERTAINMENT: Entertainment satff was amazing! They were so proffessional. Every night was different show and it was so entertaining. They can dance so wel..WOW! EVERY NIGHT WAS SO SPECTACULAR! And during day you have got also so many activities going on,you never get bored. All the staff was so helpful and friendly. We made so many friends and they really work hard. Harder than you guys back home 5 days a week 8 til 5. I really appreciate what they do for the holidaymakers. I just dont know how to thank this hotel,because I had wonderful time and had so much fun!! The only negative thing was that arount 6 pm there was not enough hot water to have a shower,but as soon as we phoned to the reception there was guy knocking on the toor wanting to repair things. I definately recommend this hotel for everybody and can't wait to go back!!! Miss everything already!! Hasta La Vista Riu Yucatan.

Im normally not a snuity traveler so here is my honest opinion about this hotel. The Good: The location is on a beautiful stretch of beach! A seven dollar cab ride from downtown playa and all the shopping. It is in a gated community wich is really nice! The staff were all very friendly. They were always greeting you with a smile and hola. The staff was all very helpful as well. I never had any problems with communication of any of our needs. The grounds are great, well layed out and easy to find everything. The rooms were cleaned daily and the grounds were very clean as well. The staff was also very attentive to any needs of their guests. The pool area was great. The Bad: The food was a 2 on a scale of 10. We ate at all of their resteraunts and the steakhouse was the best of them, but the service there was slow and the steak was not as well seasoned as it should have been. The asian resteraunt had a poor selection. The mexican resteraunt was terrible. The buffet was extensive but the food was seldom the right temperature and poorly seasoned. The soda was luke warm, too sweet and flat most of the time. Their alcoholic beverages were better, but had a tendency to be too sweet. The rooms needed a bit of maintenance work done on them to put them into good repair. It would have been really nice to have had a working exhaust fan in the toilette are of the bathroom. No one likes to smell the odor of bowel movements! The beds were as hard as a rock! I ended up with bruises on my shoiulders and hips from sleeping on them. The room scent they used in the rooms was both overpowering and nausiating. The entryway to our room and the room next to ours was VERY dark all the time! The Neutral: There was nightly entertainment for all ages and seemed to be okay. They had some vendors come in on various nights to sell their wares. There was quite a bit of animal life running around the grounds that was interesting to watch. I will try a different hotel next time but this one was not bad for the money we spent and for the beautiful beach.", "Date": "April 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Comstock Park, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel, if you like Mexico\u201d", "Author": "Domenicrocks4455", "ReviewID": "UR103340394", "Content": "I want to start off by saying \"Riu Yucatan is a great family resort if you want to get active and you enjoy Mexican culture.\" The rooms are nice, a little on the small side, no door to the bathroom... its just a curtain but there is a seperate toilet room. Beds are decent. Outdated power systems, 110V. not 120V. and most of the time the power in the rooms go out overnight and very few times in the day. The entertainment at the Riu is fantastic, there are activities starting at 10am and go till 12pm. then another session of entertainment at 3pm until 5pm. But if you have teenagers they might not like some of the activities, unless your teenager likes getting involved and having fun. There are nightly shows at the Riu and all that i have to say is \"FANTASTIC\", the rest is for you to find out! When you stay at this Hotel, you also have access to Riu Tequila \"ClubHotel\u00ae\", Riu Playacar, and Riu Lupita.

Great for the teenager but ridiculous for the group we went with. 70 year old grandparents were lectured on how to behave. After checking in we went to our rooms which were horrible. We were told they only had 2 types of rooms the one we were in and a jr suite. Our room had 2 full beds and a twin bed all pushed together like you were having a sleepover with a bunch of kids and the beds were rock hard. After sleeping 1 night we asked for a jr suite.

If you lost something or forget something anywhere in the resort (e.g. next to the beach, pool, lobby and even in your room!!!) don't wast your time looking for that. It will disappear very quickly and no one would accept any responsibility for that. If you need something in your room you should call them several times until you get what you want. Many of rooms are located next to the entertainment section which is so noisy at nights. So if you are tired and willing to sleep before 11:30 pm, then make yourself ready for a challenge with the loud music coming from the entertainment area. Also, in addition to the buffet there are three restaurants including Asian food, Mexican food and steak house which are not good at all. Also if you saw a lizard in your room, don't be surprised.

Our room was in the 3000 block, fairly close to reception overlooking a quiet walkway used by staff. The room was an excellent size and we had clean towels as often as we wanted. If you hang your used towels on the hooks by the wash basin, spare towels will be placed on the rack above the toilet. When you want clean towels just drop the dirty towels on the floor and use the new towels, the dirty towels will be replaced. Nice and simple! The Shower had really great pressure and hot water every night, unlike some countries we have visited! If your mini bar runs out of something you need just call reception and ask for it, same goes for the optics, it will be replaced same day. I would recommend taking your own beach towels as well as using the hotel towels, if you lose your hotel beach towel there is a fee to pay! We didn't leave our hotel towels on the loungers at lunchtime, we left our own towels there and took the hotel towels back to the room. Towels are available from a hut by the pool, but they disappear quickly and early. Pool bar is great, really good service, there are also help yourself dispensers for soft drinks and water during the day, which helps to keep the queues down. Take your own insulated drinking mug, the plastic cups here are very small. Beach has beautiful soft sand and you can walk for miles in each direction, to the right you will find jungle to the side of the beach, hence the monkeys who are regular visitors to the hotel. There is quite an abundance of wildlife around the hotel, the Serecki is very cute and they are everywhere! The hotel shops are very expensive, if you walk down the road to the small shopping centre opposite Riu Palace you will find much better prices. Playa Del Carmen is only a 5 minute taxi ride and will cost $5, prices can be haggled here...shop around! the difference in price can be vast! We often visited the Riu Tequila in the evening, bar staff here are great, really good fun, the atmosphere here seems to be better than at the Yucatan at night. Some of the shows are very good, particularly the Michael Jackson show. Each Riu hotel has a different show each night and they are on a 14 day turnaround. Food: well we enjoyed all of the food really, do not know what people find to complain about. We tried the 3 A la Carte restaurants and enjoyed all of them....twice! You can book these as you walk into the main restaurant for your beakfast. We liked the Shanghai restaurant the best, buffet style and plenty of choice.

Anyone can smoker anywhere except in the restaurants, it was a terrible experience when your sunning by the pool, all my clothes smelled like smoke. My family and my sister always travel together ( 8 of us) we travel to Mexico a lot and thought that we would stay at this Rui Hotel on March 21 during springbreak ( it was not even busy) . We are not \"picky\" people but we found this hotel to not be a 5 star but more like a 2-3 star. Yes it does have the old mexican look but i find this charming. When we first arrived they tried to put us in the 8000 sections ( way in the back it's a walk to the beach) the staff in the front was downright rude telling my sister to go to another hotel if we didn't want to stay in that room. It wasted 1 1/2hr to finally get things straightend out and unless you are willing to do that walk sure stay in the 8000 but with kids we wanted something closer to the pool so we got the 2000 rooms the next day and it was so much better and closer to everything and you didn't feel like you were in a different resort. Love all the monkeys and the funny looking rat like creatures but sure did not like those monkeys that woke me up at 5:00am. If you have smaller toodlers, there is not a kiddie pool just two big pools. The pool with the swim up bar was fine, i saw the staff testing the water 4 times in a day and that was when i was in the pool. As for the restaurants, the Mexican we did not like but the Chinese and Steak we ok. You need to get up to reserve at 7:00am at the buffet restaurant and wait outside but since the buffet opens early people would pretend to go and eat and then reserve from the inside while we all waited outside. Yes it was same food for breakfast and lunch and dinner but hey lets see you plan a meal for all those people. All buffets are the same everyday no matter where you go in Canada or the States so find something and quit your whinning about the food, it's food i'm sure you can find something you can eat. The pizza lady and the pancake lady, Irma was a pleasure to see and we found that this hotel people did not tip at all. The staff was overly friendly and helpful but people would not even leave a $1.00 but i'm sure that if you were back home you would. We always left $2 and everyday we left $3 to the maid, thank you Roman. Our 15yr girls went to get us some non alcohol drinks at the bar and they came back with alcohol drinks and we saw many young girls having shots all night. I guess you don't need ID there.

My hubby and I and the other couple we were travelling with all agreed that for the price it was a great great value! We had read alot of comments prior to going that the beds were very uncomfortable, we all found them fine, but then again none of use are princesses, We loved listening to the monkeys in the morning and recognized that they are WILD ANIMALS and will wake at dawn whether it is convienent for you or not! The food was good, consistant with alot of choices, if you can't find anything you like I recommend heading downtown to pick up some street food you can stuff yourself for about 3 dollars. I did see alot of folks with with the thermal cups and I wish I had thought to bring some too! Who wants to wake from a nice long nap on the beach only to find that your Miami Vice has melted. The staff were wonderful, friendly and will to engage in conversation, they are truly the best assest of the hotel, I do think that some people need to be reminded of that old addage...treat others as you would like to be treated! The only negative thing that I can comment on was the check out. We had to check out of our room at noon, but our flight didn't leave until 12:40 so we had a good long while without a room, the fellow we spoke to at the front desk was unable to help us, I am sure his hands are tied with regards to some things, and our Sunwing rep was totally uninterested in helping accommadate us.

There was 31 of us and we were there for a wedding. The food was really good. There is something for everyone. We always ate breakfast at the buffet. It was the same every day but there was an omelet station and lots of fruit. There was also bacon and scrambled eggs, pancakes, waffles, etc. For lunch, the buffet is open, but we usually just ate at the snack bar by the pool. (in the steakhouse). Here they had a small salad/fruit bar, pizza, burgers, rice, etc. It was easy and convenient to the pool (which is where we spent most of our days). For supper we did both buffet and a la carte. I recommend getting up early to make reservations for the a la carte, or you will be sick of the buffet quickly. But you have to be in line by 8am to get in and you can only reserve the same day, but you will be happy you did. We didn't try the Mexican restaurant but we did the Steakhouse and the Chinese. I enjoyed them both. The chinese is still a buffet but it is so yummy. There is no food after midnight which kinda sucks. You can go across to the Tequila and eat if you really want to but we didn't. This is how they can say 24 hour snacks. The drinks are awesome!! They have pretty much anything you could want and there are several bars to choose from. FYI, as a \"greedy Canadian\" I would like to clarify the reason we bring our own \"huge flasks\" or \"greedy cups\". The reason is NOT because we are greedy or because we drink too much. The reason is because we like our drinks to stay cold. And we want to stand in line the least time possible on our vacation. A slush drink in a clear plastic cup will be melted in 3 to 5 minutes. In a thermos cup it will stay cold for 3 to 5 HOURS!!! I sensed that the bartenders were irritated as well. I am not sure why since it made us have to go to the bar way less often. I have seen several comments on this so I wanted to explain. As mentioned in many reviews, the beds are hard and the blankets thin. If you call front desk, they will bring you thicker, fuzzy blankets which are way better!! Our room had pop and beer in the fridge and 4 dispensers of hard liquor. They only stock them every 2nd day. (more like 2-3 times all week). We had to go to the lobby for water every 2nd day. I drink alot of water and you can only drink bottled, so it was kind of a pain. It would be nice if there was other places to get bottled water around the resort, but we made do. Overall, the resort is great for the price!

The beach is that over populated there are fag buts and rubbish onthe beach not very clean.

The first night we got cold and the mattresses were hard. But a call to the front desk got us all blankets and they put padded mattress covers on making the beds very soft. We were at the back of the resort and glad. Lots of US spring break kids and loads of Canadians having fun. We were expecting this since Mexico is a party and it is spring break. Expect this time of year load kids and door slamming around 2 or 3 AM. Was it bad no in fact the monkeys at 3 AM were loader in the early morning. Food is OK. Breakfast was the same day in and day out. Lunch was good too. Same each day though but I\u2019ve had much worse. Dinner was good. They did have a variety at night. We ate at the steak house and it was not bad. Frankly if you can\u2019t find something to eat at the resort then you\u2019re too picky and maybe should not travel out of the country. Pools were great. Had to get up at 7 AM to go put towels on the recliners or you would not get one. To say people are paying off the staff to get chairs is ignorant; those people just didn\u2019t get to the pool in time. Not saying this is right but that is the way it works. Staff works their butts off. Friendly and do react to requests. Beach is great. Large and never had a problem finding a seat there. For the money this resort is a great value and close to Playa Del Carmen. Sits in a nice area where you can walk without feeling at risk. Taxi to Playa is $7.00. Con for us was we have a 7 year old and there was no kid\u2019s pool although they had a kids program. That young girl overseeing the kids program was great with kids too.

It's close enough to the town of Playa to walk if you want to, or take a taxi (cost has gone up from last year - it's now $7.00 each way for 1-4 people, and $14 for 5-8). We like being far enough away that our kids wouldn't go into town on their own. The beach is beautiful, the pool area is nice. Building 4 is closest to the beach side restaurant/lunch area (quiet), then building 5 in the middle and building 6 is behind the stage area (noisy until the show is over and the pool area bars close). 1, 2 and 3 are the next layer back from the ocean - with 1 probably the quietest as it's away from the main walkway. Buildings 7, 8 and 9 are closer to the lobby and behind the tennis court area. We were in 7 on the lobby side and it was so noisy at night from the partiers in the lobby bar area. The kids enjoyed hanging out at the Riu Tequila in the Sports Bar (pool tables, etc.) and the nightclub. There were a lot of volleyball games going on and off all day long, there's a Scuba Caribe right on sight and lots of activities you can enjoy. Free are the boogie boards, the catamarans and the kayaks. We checked in pretty late at night. I assumed there would be a cot for our 3rd adult in one of the rooms, but there wasn't. I called and they brought it right away, along with some hangars (or hooks, as they called them). I also asked for cushions for the beds the next day and they were put on. I was glad to have my travel pillow and blanket as there is only one thin blanket and a sheet (and we like the AC on). Drinks are replenished every other day, but just go to the front desk to ask for water if you run out. Food was good - we ate at Steak House and Mexican. Options at steak house are porterhouse, sirloin, pork ribs or chicken. I had chicken and it was good with the bbq sauce they had. I had shrimp in the Mexican and didn't like it so much. But the salad bar and appetizers & soup there were good. Buffet was good - always enjoy the fish and trying new items. They had grouper almost every day for lunch and dinner - very good. Very popular with the kids was the pizza and the pasta they cooked to order. Two of the days they brought out food by the pool bar and served - one day was nachos (chili, salsa, etc.) and one day was hamburgers. Chips & cheese always available by the pop machines, and ice cream is available most of the day. Late night snacks can be found in the Sports bar at the Tequila (cold pizza, sandwiches, fruit, burgers, etc. with a microwave for heating). It was busy by the pool and on the beach - most days all the chairs were taken. We had no problem as someone always got up early to get a few, and we were in the same spot almost every day so everyone knew where to find each other. A few of us got sand flea bites - and I found that having the Benadryl itch stick, hydrocortisone and Benadryl pills helped a ton (compared to last year when the itch lasted a good 2 weeks and was horrible, this time it was like 3 days and not bad). One of our group got a little sick, possibly from drinking tap water. (take probiotics before going to get some good gut bacteria to fight off any issues). We took the ferry to Cozumel for snorkeling in Chakanaab (sp?). We paid to get in, and paid again to rent the snorkel gear. Lots of first time snorkelers and they loved it - the water is pretty calm there. They also have swimming with dolpins and manatees there for extra $. No problem using US dollars anywhere. The ferry does not take credit cards. I took Meclazine before the ride as I read it could be a little wavey. Only heard one person throw up on the ride - a little kid. They pass out barf bags if you want one. We sat on upper level - lower is probably better if you get seasick easily. Our kids sat outside on the upper deck and enjoyed the ride. On the way back we listened to a live band on the lower level. The little town of Cozumel is nice. When we bought our ferry tickets I asked if the round trip were good for both ferry companies and they said yes. But they weren't, so we had to wait til 5pm to return - but had fun doing a little shopping while we waited. Our group of 27 ate at Carlos & Charlies and everyone really enjoyed it - they do a great job there. Lots of fun and the food was good too (fish tacos for me...yum!). We walked to the Riu Playacar one night and had a drink by the pool area - it was REALLY quiet at that hotel compared to the Yucatan.

I will be very fair and honest with my review of this hotel. This is based on our experiences from traveling to the Bahamas, Cancun, and Puerto Vallarta twice. The moment we arrived at the hotel we felt welcomed. The staff was a little rusty in the complete details of our stay but they were extremely nice and warm. We had heard about the potential issue of smelly rooms due to sewer gas. We stayed in room 1317 and found a small smell in the shower but after running the water reguarly for the first day it went away for the most part. We found the room to be average. The floor and restroom area as far as being updated was adequate. The 22inch old zenith tv and the very old bed need to be addressed, however you can request an egg cover for the bed to make it better. The pillows are extremely bad in our opinion. The idea of a in-room bar fridge was okay in my opinion. But we will get to the all in-clusive thing a little bit later. Next we rate the location of the resort. We walked the complete area from the resort to the downtown of Playa and I must say the Riu Yucatan beach front is one of the best in the area by far. As you walk from the resort to downtown the beach gets worse as far as sand being in the wave water hitting the coast. So in that regard the Riu has a great beach. Next we rate the overall facilities of the hotel. Exterior first. There are two swim up bars. Overall they are both pretty nice and the pool area in general is very nice. I do suggest if you are looking for a top notch drinking all in-clusive location this is not a location I would recommend. They like to get by with cheap alcohol, however will use better run and tequila if you ask for it. They only have one beer in all of the facility Dos Equis and it is only on tap. That is a little disappointing. I will also say if you don't give a little tip every day to the pool bar guys or the night bar guys you will get mixed service. Overall the service however is good. Next to the pool towel thing and getting a pool seat. YOU must be out by 8:00am to get a good spot by the pool if you don't you will be hard pressed to find a decent location in the sun/pool area. Also get your pool towels early. Thats all I can say about that. Next we move on to the food at this location which is the second component to an all in-clusive after the alcohol. The food is average. It is that simple. It is not great and it is not terrible. It is overall just average. I will say they do have a great selection but the quality of food is average for the most part. We personally felt that the Asian and Mexican restaurant were bad for them to be their specialty restaurants. After we ate at those two locations we skipped the Steak house restaurant. We actually felt that the supper buffet had better food than speciality restaurants. And towards the middle of our trip we actually started eating most of our supper meals downtown. Next we will address the night life and the bar locations beside the pool bars. The nightly entertainment is below average in my opinion. There is one main area where they have a nightly dance/jig. It is not really our cup of tea. We are however 34 years old and we are really not party people but the entertainment was a little silly. The bar areas at night are usually pretty happening. The service is above average in my opinion. Other than the main area of entertainment the hotel does not offer anything else, such as a piano bar, game room, etc. We did go the Riu Tequila one night a sister hotel that is in very close walking distance and they do have a sport bar area and a disco club dance place. Now on to housekeeping. They in my opinion do a great job especially for an older hotel, etc. Overall the people are very friendly and they do try to make you feel important. There is also some daytime entertainment such as sand volleyball, rifle shooting, water polo, bingo, etc. They also have extra books for the book readers to read and do a good job of having daily snack food if you get hungry. Next is the sleeping environment of the hotel. Like I had mentioned earlier we have stayed in several places and this was by far the loudest resort we have ever stayed on. First is the damn black birds which are loud and have a pretty voice at 5am but they are an ugly bird. Next is the hotel staff that is out and about at 6 to 7 am doing lawn chores and moving housekeeping tubs around the grounds, so if you need to sleep in bring a loud fan to plug in for white noise. I will close by mentioning a few things off site. Downtown has very good local food, however it is expensive overall. Downtown Playa is getting very commercialized. Eat Breakfast, Lunch and or dinner at Las Mananitas Yellow tents out front very good. Finally do not use Snorkeling Adventures to go snorkeling at Cozumel. There office is located directly across the street from the fairy service booths by the dock of Playa Del Carmen. It was terrible. Enough said. Amelio is a liar. do not trust.

This is our 5th stay at the Riu brand hotel in the last four years and this is the first time we have been disappointed. We traveled with three other couples who had also had experiences with other Riu's. First, our room and my brother's room next door smelled like sewage. We informed the hotel staff daily and once in a while they would spray air freshener but they wouldn't even move us rooms until Thursday evening (we were leaving Saturday). If we plugged the bathroom sink, put a glass over the shower drain and shut the bathroom door our smell wasn't as bad but that didn't work for my brother's. We heard gurgling in our shower when toilets were flushed in rooms nearby. They were fully booked and when they are fully booked they don't have enough beach towels, staff, or wash rags. Three days we got no wash rags, another day we got them after calling so they could bring us some. We did speak to hotel manager about moving us to the Palace (and we were wiling to pay whatever the difference) but they were fully booked all week. The hotel manager wasn't very helpful, I understand they were booked but he didn't make a big effort to fix some of our biggest complaints (ie. the sewage smell). Beds were hard (my husband and I have come to expect that so it didn't bother us as much) but another couple in our group called daily to get a foam pad for there bed and weren't able to get one until Thursday. The rooms need major updating/maintenance (mold in the showers, cracked tiles, broken showerhead). We didn't get the service we were used to at this brand or quality of the rooms, but we still had a great time. The grounds are beautiful and they do work hard cleaning and maintaining the grounds/pool. They were painting, scrubbing, cleaning the grounds every day we were there. This was our favorite beach of the five Riu's we have stayed at. Given what I've come to expect at this brand, I would not recommend this hotel until they do some renovations.

I can't say enough about how incredible the service was, probably the best service I've ever received at a resort. The staff are very friendly, and very willing to accommodate any request. The food is outstanding as well, with a very good selection at the buffet for any meal. One thing of note - the dress code for supper used to be quite strict, with men having to wear long pants and a collared shirt in order to be let in, but these rules have been relaxed. Shorts and t-shirts are now allowed, muscle shirts, tank tops and bathing suits are not acceptable wear for the supper meal however. The only complaint I would have for the meals is the curious lack of cheddar cheese. One of the main staples of the lunch meal is hamburgers (although there are other choices) and not having cheddar cheese seemed to be a strange oversight. They do have cheese, but in the group I was in (eight of us) no one cared for the type of cheese available. Not a major problem to be sure, but still annoying. Besides the buffet, they also have a la cart restaurants, with the Chinese one being quite good. Stay away from the Mexican one however, as your choices are quite limited, and again the cheese the use ruins the handful of dishes available. The rooms are very comfortable, with ice cold A/C and very hot water for showers. As with any resort in the Caribbean, you shouldn't drink any tap water, however the hotel provides a generous amount of bottled water in your mini-fridge, as well as Pepsi, 7-Up and beer. There are also 4 forty ounce bottles of liquor in every room, and if you run out you can have more brought to your room as long as it's before 6:00pm. Seeing as how the lobby bar is open 22 hours a day, alcohol is always readily available. The beach is fantastic, with soft white sand and a great many lounge chairs. We had a great time swimming in the ocean, and for those who are adverse venturing into salt water, the pool is very large and has dozens of lounge chairs surrounding it. Regardless of what time of day it is, their's always plenty of room in the pool for any swimmers in your group. Finding a lounge chair by the pool is a different story however, with no chairs to be had in the afternoon, so getting there early is a must. Lastly I would comment on the entertainment. While the shows are quite good, be aware that they don't start until 9:30pm, sometimes 9:45. If you have any younger children with you (as we did) I can pretty much guarantee they won't be able to stay up that late. I would highly recommend the Riu Yucatan to anyone thinking of a vacation to Mexico. Beautiful location (there were 3 weddings during our week long stay), excellent food, clean, well maintained rooms, outstanding service, very safe and quite close to Playa del Carmen. For 5-6 bucks a cab will take you pretty much anywhere you want to go. The group of eight I traveled with all thoroughly enjoyed our vacation there from start to finish.

I would suggest that when booking request a room away from the reception area.

Some things we really liked about this property: The resort was clean and pretty. Our room was just fine. The beach was beautiful. The weather was great! The staff was generally friendly, warm, and helpful. The buffet restaurant always had at least one (often several) dishes out that we really, really enjoyed. Some things we were disappointed in: We're not big drinkers, but we do have some preferences. The beer at all the bars is dispensed from a Dos XX tap, but is clearly NOT Dos XX- very cheap and watery. The alcohol they use in all the mixed drinks was also of poor quality. It just didn't taste good. We did discover late in our stay that you can order a Margarita \"with Cuervo\". Much better. We tried the steakhouse restaurant and it was truly AWFUL. So bad it became funny. The Asian restaurant was average..I would consider doing that one again. The buffet was generally the best option. We tried the snack bar one time and the hamburgers and fries were cold, dry, and hard. We didn't go back there again. One other complaint is the lack of towels. The latest we ever arrived at the pool deck was 9am, and they were always out of towels by this time. The entertainment/shows were a sincere effort, but really cheesy. (ie celebrity impersonators) Not our style at all. A recommendation: If you are a \"partier\" the buildings nearest the pool/beach would be fine for you. If you want to sleep before the wee hours of the morning and are sensitive to noise they would NOT be a good fit for you. Between the entertainment and the bars, lots of noise and activity in this area. We asked for a \"quiet room\" and were placed in building 9. This was perfect. Only a few minutes more to walk to the beach/pool, but we could not hear any of the noise from the pool deck at night. It was very peaceful. Regarding some complaints I read frequently on this site before we went: I saw comments that the pool was in disrepair. This week the pool was beautiful...not shabby and peeling at all. This must have been repaired. I can also say that during our week stay in February we had no issues with bugs of any sort. I never used the bug repellent I had packed. This must be seasonal. Also, regarding the comments about the hard beds, yes, they are much harder than what is typical in the US. However, if you've traveled outside the US at all I think you will find them about average. I'm used to something softer but adjusted to the beds here pretty quickly. It wasn't a big deal. Regarding the sewer smell...there were indeed places on the resort where I could smell sewage for a few minutes as I walked past. Not near my room, not near the beach, not where we ate. Yes, it's there, but I would guess that's not unusual in Mexico and it really was fairly isolated and didn't bother us. All-in-all we had a very nice time. If I were to do an all-inclusive again I would save to be able to stay at a place the next-tier up. If I'm going to pay to have all my meals and drinks in one place I want them to be really great. Food here was all over the board and drinks were disappointing. Staff and facilities and beach were very nice. Two other non-resort suggestions: We were excited to shop on 5th ave, but ended up leaving quickly and we probably wouldn't go back. The vendors were asking very high prices for their merchandise and quickly turned nasty when we wouldn't pay what they were asking (one vendor actually called my friend a very nasty name as she walked out of his store). It wasn't fun. On the flip side of the coin, we booked a tour with \"Edventures\" out of Tulum- you'll find it on trip advisor- and had a GREAT experience. We would highly recommend it!", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "glasgow", "Title": "\u201cBest holiday ever\u201d", "Author": "keira27", "ReviewID": "UR95953201", "Content": "This was the best holiday ever.

As noted in some other reviews, I just don't understand how people found negative things about this resort. Fantastic, wide, long, clean beach. Never had a problem getting a lounger. Rooms were spotless. We were in the 8000 block on the third (top) floor. At first I was a bit disappointed, but soon realized we may have had the best location and one of the best rooms. Fairly close to the main building, but far enough away to be very quiet. The room had 16 - 18 foot cathedral ceilings. There are no balconies with a beach view, but I loved ours since it fronted onto lots of lush, tall trees - very private ( you could be naked out there - no problem!) Staff were great! We are not real liquor drinkers, but like our beer. The four bottles they placed every two days in the mini bar just didn't do the trick. Phoned the front desk and the bar guy comes up and places eight bottles in the fridge, and then the next day the front desk phoned to follow up and asked if my request had been fulfilled. The staff at the bar are fantastic! Fast, fast, fast! 20 pesos a night tip goes a long way to ensuring great service. Food - lots of variety, nicely prepared. Yes, the wine isn't the greatest - found the white to be the most palatable. I highly recomend getting off the resort to do some exploring. Went to Playa del Carmen twice. 50 pesos cab fare. Felt very safe. Chichin Itza Mayan tour highly recommended. Overall, I really enjoyed this place and would recommend it. For people who have been to Varadero (we've been twice), I found this to be a better resort experience, and although the beach isn't quite as nice, it's very close. The only other thing is the beach is much more crowded than Varadero, but it wasn't a problem, and there was plenty of room to walk to a quieter spot.", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Resort - Could not have been better\u201d", "Author": "Valerie084", "ReviewID": "UR94981973", "Content": "A great resort with the most sincere, genuine, helpful and happy staff.

We booked last minute with First Choice and paid just under \u00a3950 each. Check in was fine at Manchester We always book into the VIP lounge at Manchester as a treat. On the plane we were sat in row 14 and were freezing throughout the whole flight. The inflight entertainment was ok as was the food. Arrived at Cancun Airport and soon enough we got on the coach to the hotel. The rep at the airport James was fantastic. He told us the basics and then put a DVD on for us to watch on the 1hr transfer. When we arrived at the hotel we were given a glass of champagne and a rose and we had a group check in. This was great, quick and easy. We met our resort rep Wendy and she told us about the welcome meeting which was the following day. Before long we were in our room and our cases were delivered. The weather that night was pouring with rain and the following morning it was overcast and chilly. Our welcome meeting was at 9:30am in the Margarita restaurant. As welcome meetings go, I never usually enjoy them, I just was to get out and about. I was so glad I went. Wendy has a great knowledge of Playa Del Carmen and knows a lot of the locals. My fiance, who loves scuba diving, was able to book with Dive Mike in the town as recommended by Wendy and the price was half what the hotel offered. I liked the fact Wendy wasn't trying to force us into booking an excursion through Thomson/First Choice. Weather: The first day the weather was overcast and windy. We walked into the town along the beach (it took about 35mins) and it soon brightened up. The days that followed were glorious. We didn't see any rain apart for one evening and it poured down for about 20 mins. We had one overcast day and then they day we left it was overcast as well. (put it this way, I have a great tan!) Food: Anyone who complains about the food just baffles me! There is so much variety at breakfast, I didn't have the same breakfast on the entire trip. Lunch times were a little repetitive but I think its only if you let it. Everyday they have a different soup on and I really enjoyed them. We ate at all 3 a la carte restaurants and loved the Asian. This is all buffet style and to be honest I overfaced myseld and couldn't manage the pudding. The steak house was great, the steak I got was huge and I couldn't finish it. You can also eat at the Riu Tequila, Riu Playacar and Riu Lupita for breakfast and lunch. We went to the Tequila one night to have a look around and you could get drinks there. The Tequila and Lupita are not on the beach- there is a buggy that transports you to the beach from the Tequila. Beach: Gorgeous! Loads of loungers in the shade and in the sun. The beach gets very busy but we always managed to get a lounger. The sea was quite rough when we were there. You could still swim in it but on a few occasions I was stood in it up to my knees and waves would come up and go up to my chest. Pool: We didn't sit around the pool as we found it was very shaded there. We did go in the Jacuzzi which was nice. Rooms: We have stayed in 2 Riu resorts before (Riu Caribe in Cancun and Riu Palace Tropical Bay in Jamaica). The rooms here were slightly dates. I wasn't keen on the bathroom having no door and just a curtain but at the end of the day we only showered and slept in there and everything else makes up for that! Grounds: The gardens are full of wildlife. There are monkeys dangling out the trees at breakfast. You are not meant to feed them but everyone was taking the bananas out of breakfast and feeding them. The babies are so cute. There were lizzards, limas and these weird little creatures like guinea pigs which are called agoutis (i think). Staff: WOW!!!!! The staff are great. At our welcome meeting Josef who is the Riu Area director was there and he told us all about the facilities of the hotel. He was so friendly and always made an effort to speak to you whenever you saw him. The bar staff at the Mezcal and Tequila bar (near the theatre) were amazing. We tipped each night 20pesos and as soon as our glass was 2/3 empty we got another without even asking (this did prove lethal and we had hangovers on many occassions). Fernando and Noemi were so funny. Trips: We like to so our own thing when we go away. We got the Hydrofoil over to Cozumel. Its 160pesos and takes about 40 minutes. Cozumel is lovely. We had a great meal at Tikki Tok on the front and had a few beers and it cost about \u00a38!!! There are a lot of people trying to sell trips on glass bottom boats and car hire. Do not accept there first price... they come down to at least half the price. We had a horse drawn carriage ride around the town which was funny. Taxis from the hotel to Playa Del Carmen town are only 50pesos but make sure you state the price before you get in. We went into the town everyday. Drink prices vary from 20pesos to around 45pesos for a bottle of corona but you'll always find a happy hour somewhere. We went to a restaurant one night called Ajua- the food was ok but it was so expensive and they charges us 135pesos service charge. Don't stay on the resort, get out and about and mingle with the locals, it really is great. We highly recommend Dive Mike which is just near Burger King for Scuba Diving. It was $75US for 2 dives and all equipment hire. Jorge who was the guide was excellent. Check out was quick and easy. The coach did break down on the way to the airport but we still got there on time. This resort is great, everyone is friendly and we cannot wait to go back.

The bad reviews just did not make sense to us during our trip. The Staff is wonderful every request we made was granted with a smile. I see no reason whatsoever to wait around in your room for somebody to bring you something we needed an extra blanket we found a chamber maid & one was placed in our room we needed extra water we went to the front desk. The only thing I requested by phone was regular pepsi be brought up for the mini bar & that took no time at all. The third night I found the bed a bit hard & the front desk had foam toppers delivered within an hour. The food is amazing ...There are 5 stations with 5 different types of food and than the other side has salad bars some hot dishes fresh fruit amazing cheese, so many types of bread and two desert stations. One station has a different entree every night some nights roast beef some nights roast turkey or roast pork all were delicious. We liked sitting outside to eat & if the table was still dirty from the last couple we moved the plates ourselves & if we had to get out own drinks oh well. The biggest problem I could see is that at the buffet you are supposed to be offered wine water beer or softdrinks couples kept asking the waiters to leave the buffet area go out to the bar in the lobby & get them mixed drinks. There is a bar right outside the Hacienda and you could have brought your mixed drink in or left the area to get a drink yourself. I was surprised to see very little tipping a couple of american dollars went a long way. Lunch at the beach was the same every day fish burgers soup fries salad a bit of mexican fare but if you wanted you could walk up to the front of the hotel once again and the food stations all offered multiple choices. We were not crazy about the steak place but my husband loved the Asian ala carte. However the service at the steak ala carte was wonderful. One night there were just too many people it must have been a crossover night with incoming and out going and I thought the staff handled that very well. As for the pool I really didn't use it other than to go to the swim up bar once. We spent most of our time at the ocean the water is 80 degrees the sand is soft the water clear and you could see little schools of fish darting around. The room was charming and very clean the chamber maids added flowers to our curtains they made different towel animals every day. The bartenders were wonderful loved Benito Eduardo Erika & Florencio they remembered you and were very entertaining. Try a Blue Ocean they are delicious. The shows were fun the dancers talented and the specialty nights were a blast. We found that most of the people from the other resorts were at our bars at night. To each their own when in North America we stay at the Hilton, we are aware that this hotel is not a Hilton but we loved the charm of the hotel it felt Mexican the lobby is beautiful the grounds are very well maintained the flowers are beautiful, the cute animals are everywhere I believe they were called cerrities but I am probably wrong and there is a family of monkeys that we were able to see up close. We stayed in the 8000 series of rooms this is close enough to the front that you don't get the noise from the bars and far away from the road that you don't hear the traffic.

After booking we began to read some of the reviews and were getting pretty worried that we may have made a mistake. We definately didn't have anything to worry about. We have visited all inclusive resorts in St Lucia, Barbados, Domican, Cuba and Jamaica. This is one of the only resorts that we are planning on revisiting. The staff at this hotel need to be commended first and foremost. We have never been treated so well. Everyone is extremely friendly. Front desk staff were always helpful and followed up with requests made for the room to ensure that everything was satisfactory - which it was. Bar staff were very efficient and friendly. The entertainment staff (especially Obama Jr) were something else. They were always cheerful and made us feel like family. We stayed on the top floor of building #8. There were no complaints about the room. The housekeeping staff ensured that the bar fridge was restocked daily and the room was kept very neat and tidy. Towels were always replaced and they even made cute animals out of the towels and left them on the bed. The beds are ridiculously uncomfortable. We had toppers on the bed but found that we could not get a full night sleep as we kept waking up with sore backs, hips etc. Maybe we should have had an extra cocktail at night to aid in our sleep! The service in this hotel is amazing. Our daughter became very ill one night and we ended up needing replacement bedding and towels after 10:30 at night. We called to the front desk requesting this as well as a mop and housekeeping was at our door within 10 minutes. We have never experienced that kind of service at any of the other resorts that we have stayed at (including Sandals and Beaches). We found the food to be great. Lunch did get a little repetative especially at the BBQ grill but we always found something to make our mouth water. Breakfast and dinner had more choices than you could try and all of it was top notch. The pool was smaller than we thought but we never had any difficulty in finding a chair and spent most of our time there. The beach is phenominal. You can walk for miles. It is a beautiful white sand beach and we found lots of shells with our kids for their collection. We only made it to one show at night but found it it be fun and entertaining. The area itself is great. There is so much to saee and do. We couldn't do everything we wanted as we were only there for a week but we are planning to return to this resort next year to finish up our sightseeing. We travelled with two children aged 11 and 13 and we felt very safe both on an off the resort. We did not feel uncomfortable in walking to the shopping areas at all. All in all this was a wonderful vacation and we can't wait to go back. I can't give enough credit to all of the staff at this resort - they really made our vacation one of the best we have ever had.

This was my first experience at an all inclusive. Typically, I cruise (60+ days at sea), and my review may be somewhat biased in comparison. The resort was probably 85% full. Many northern European folks (lots of British and German). Less than 20% Americans. At least 25% had small children. Not too many young couples / college kids (though I understand from staff that changes in March) Moderate drinking - only a few folks that were out of control - and they were handled quickly. Site - the location is absolutely fantastic!! The beach is spectacular. The grounds are extremely well maintained. The rooms, common areas, and dining rooms were impeccably clean - Disney World type clean. Even the beach area was immaculately cleaned up (glasses, dishes, paper, etc) No issue with lounge chairs, towels, etc. were all in plentiful supply. Staff - the staff was very hit and miss. A few were friendly and very engaging. But unlike our cruise experience, there were very few people who even attempted to communicate in English. My son is fluent in Spanish, and even in Spanish, many of the staff would just nod and move on without communicating. The cleaning staff did an exceptional job. The wait staff was overall very poor. We gave up trying to get beverage service during meals - we simply started to help ourselves to water, juice, etc. The service in the specialty restaurants was even worse. Our night at the Mexican restaurant lasted 2+ hours just to get served simple fajitas. (This after being immediately escorted to the salad bar) The steak house service was just as poor. Just not very attentive. Food - very mediocre. The buffet had reasonable choices but less than 10% of the dishes changed each day. Got very repetitive. Breakfast was the best - including Mexican fare and made to order eggs, etc. Lunch was the worse - people mainly eating pizza and hamburgers. Dinner had a few nice specialty nights but we were surprised at how little sea food was on the menu. A max of 2 fish entrees each day. The specialty restaurant food was quite a bit worse than the buffet - very tough steak, small portions, not much flavor. Probably the most disappointing part - and so much different from cruises. Rooms - beds were very, very firm. Almost rock hard. The rooms were very quirky. 1 room had lights that did not work. Another had a ceiling fan that did not work. Finally unplugged the floor lamp in our room - it would mysteriously turn itself on each night. Each of our 4 rooms was missing something (pillows, blankets, etc) on arrival. The electrical was kind of strange - -it took sometime to figure out what turned on what. Common areas - my biggest surprise - smoking was allowed in all the common areas (except the buffet). I have allergy to smoke and found it impossible to use the free wifi in the common area - the smoke was that thick. This was very different from cruises were few common areas were designated smoking. Unless there was a different way to connect, I would not go back. Pool was extremely cold. The jacuzzi did not work - in fact - it was converted into a kiddie pool. I paid ~$800 per person. I found it to be a poor value in comparison to what I have been paying for cruises. The all inclusive alcohol is not a big selling point for me - we typically drink wine at dinner (the wine was AWFUL) and an occasional drink. So having all our alcohol covered was not that big of deal. If you're looking for a great beach, clean rooms, free alcohol, and don't care all that much about food and service - you will be very happy.

My husband, son and I went with 5 other members of my family. I have only stayed at one other all inclusive resort and I prefer this one. There are just as many positives as there are negatives for this hotel and I find it easiest just to list them. Postives: The staff was extremely friendly. If you needed something, they were there for you. Any questions you have are answered promply. The maids also did a great job cleaning our rooms. They were spotless. I love the location of the beach and how all water activities (without a motor) are included in the price. The drinks were made well and the food was good quality with a good selection. Negatives: The first day we arrived at the hotel, there were random things missing from our rooms- like the bottled water that was supposed to be in our fridge, the extra blankets in the closet, and my other family members' rooms were both missing shower curtains??? All of the items were brought when we requested them. We think the mistakes were made because we checked in early and the maids were rushing. Secondly, there was a terrible sewage smell in some areas. My husband really disliked this and others commented. Thirdly, the children's area. We have a seven year old child and the kids' area was really neglected. The trampoline had torn sides and there were leaves all over it. There was no paper and fewer crayons in the building for the kids. There were empty glasses scattered around the building. The ping-pong table had no ball and the net wasn't on correctly. What kid can enjoy such an area? Perhaps the hotel could give a \"children's\" pack of crayons, paints, and a small coloring book for kids? Or more toys in the play area that would require you give your room number (similar to the towel cards used)? Fourthly, I would like to see more WiFi in the rooms. It was strictly in the lobby which could be a nuisance depending on where your room is and whether you have children with you. An in-room wifi system would but much more convenient! The swimming pool was also freezing! I would rather go in the ocean, which was warmer anyway! Overall, this is a great hotel.

Although everyone we met said they wouldn't travel so far to just to stay a week, it ticked all of our boxes and we had a very relaxing week. This is what we had paid for, hot weather, beautiful beach, hotel etc. We are happy with the experience that we had, although we do agree with other reviews that this is not a 5 star hotel. Cleanliness of facilities: The hotel was exceptionally clean and the staff were all over it like a rash, cleaning, gardening, even the smallest of areas were being given a thorough clean daily and the service was very good and attentive. But it still wasn't to the same standard you would get in a 5* hotel. The pool was chilly when you first dipped in but once you were in, it was fine and refreshing. Exceptionally clean and very well attended to. The swim up bars were brilliant serving both alcoholic and non alcoholic cocktails. Entertainment: We were on honeymoon and therefore weren't interested in attending evening entertainment shows but the one that we did see was done well, albeit really a dance troupe rather than all round entertainers. Still, they were good and created a good vibe for the audience. The day time entertainers, Activity Team, were very enthusiastic. Always trying to get people to do volley ball, bowls, rifle shooting, water polo, aerobics etc. They did little dances on the side of the pool and really got everyone going. They didn't hassle you when you declined to participate which was professional. Rooms: Our first impression of our room was that it looked a little dated but to be honest, it was in keeping with the Mexican style that we had expected. It was very clean. Yes, the dressing area and wardrobe was off the main bedroom within the bathroom and it didn't have an extractor fan but we showered daily and didn't experience damp clothes or bedding. The room had air con and it cleared the heat very quickly. There was a well stocked mini bar with water and soft drinks all free and replenished every other day but we got water free every day when we asked for it. Alcohol was provided free (beer in fridge & optics for things like tequila and vodka). Ice machines were on all blocks and you had a bucket in your room. TV, ironing board, iron, hairdryer....all as expected. The reference to this hotel not being 5* was represented in the room in the sense that the bedding was not luxurious and basic in terms of a sheet and overthrow, with a pillow each. Although we had two double beds together so managed to use sheets and pillows from the spare. No room service on food though which would help the hotel be more like a 5* environment. We often wanted a snack for tea and nothing large but had no choice but to fall within the set times of meals. Food: Food was served at good times but the variety was limited and not a 5* standard although we always found something we liked. We were a bit disappointed that the food choices seems to be more aimed at the US market and not as authentic as we would have imagined. We still felt like we had over indulged though. Life there revolves around meal times and eating! We would go again but feel that it would be too far to take the children. We would recommend it and feel that the money we paid was well spent (approx \u00a32k).

We were very pleased with the Riu Yucatan. Yes, the beds are hard, Yes, the food would get to be the same if you stayed there for 2-3 weeks. We stayed 5 nights, Jan2-Jan7th, we all enjoyed the food at each meal, some was better than others. Everyone needs to remember that this resort is a melting pot of the world, we are from the USA, and can tell you that we felt like the minority most of the time. Not that we minded or felt out of place. We enjoyed the buffet, and looking at all the food that must be requests of the world wide guests that come here. It appeared to us that there are a lot of people that enjoy lunch meat and cheese for every meal....different strokes for different folks. We found everyone to be nice and friendly, whether staff or guests. Our 18 yr old son really enjoyed the European women sun bathing habits on the beach (topless). Not a bid deal, it just happens. Bottom line, if you want to be waited on hand and foot, and eat the finest food day in and day out, don't go here, you will be disappointed, but I suspect that some people wouldn't be happy if they were hung with a new rope.

Well we found it at the riu yucatan. I personally always love the riu chain, they offer a guaranteed service to its clientele. We travelled during the 2010/2011 new years week and were looking to party. Although the party was NOT at the yucatan, the tequila across the street was always busy at night. In point form these were the pros (since im lazy) PROS -amazing location (the complex of playacar is in a gated community so its VERY safe) -decent food (pretty good, most of the people that complain are old with high standards) -very clean -to die for beach (see my pics) -close to town ($5 5 minute cab ride to 5th avenue) -friendly staff (i tipped less than i usually do and thats cause i didnt feel i needed to constantly kiss up to receive great service) -easy to book a la carts (we booked them at 10am every morning as we went into the breakfast buffet without hassle) -rooms had alot of storage space -really energetic entertainment staff CONS -no 24hr sports/snack bar -no disco (not that we cared) -no computers (no sure if there was wifi though) -quiet lobby bar at night (walk across the street to the tequila...for some reason its ALOT nicer than the yucatan and its not on the beach) -the safe is really ghetto....... -one morning around 6am when we came home from the clubs, the sun didnt rise yet but all the lights in the hallways were off.....we literally had to feel the walls to get to our room -we thought we had full access to the tequila but we didnt....only to drink, not to eat -new years gala dinner was realllllly strange....weird food, every other meal was good though -cheap wine in conclusion: if you are older and love to relax you would like this resort as long as your standards aren't riu palace material. If you are a family this is perfect for you. If you are like myself and my friends you will enjoy this resort but i would probably recommend the tequila because it is nicer, newer and u can eat/drink at all the rius in the playacar complex. The walk to the beach is literally 5 minutes inside the gate community of playacar...nothing sketchy about it. The beach makes up for any cons....best ive been to ever... also, make sure u: try the tacos across from coco bongo in town visit tulum and go snorkeling there avoid the playacar market beside the tequila, NOONE bargains...go to 5th for souvenirs sea doo infront of the hotel....30 each person for double rider at thirty minutes if you have a chance to visit playa del carmen during the BPM house music festival you are in for a treat.....its insanee if not, enjoy the beach and the beautiful surroundings!", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat trip, but...\u201d", "Author": "Rongordo", "ReviewID": "UR92090342", "Content": "Went to the Riu Yucatan the week of New Year's with wife and friends. Had a great trip even though we normally stay at adults only resorts. I now understand though what others meant by \"it's definitely NOT a 5 star\". Before we get into a re-run of what is not 5 star about this hotel, let's look at the positives. It is a clean resort, and well laid out in my book. We stayed in 9 block which is away from the noise but also only a 5 minute walk to the beach. The service was absolutely fantastic - specifically Armando in the pool bar and Benito and Florencio at the bar Tequila. The latter are absolutely hilarious!! They spend as much time horsing around with the guests and creating shooters for the bar (as many as 30-40 at a time) as they do making drinks yet always manage to hand you a fresh drink when yours is low. They seemed to remember what everyone at the bar was drinking whether they tipped large or not. Having 2 bars close to each other and outdoors was great. It's amazing that so many resorts are lost to the fact that Canadians want to sit outside at night (I'm looking at you Royal Hideaway). The so-so stuff was the food. As mentioned many many times prior - the food is not fantastic, there are only 3 \"restaurants\" aside from the main buffet and 2 are actually buffets themselves. In the end though, I did not starve and managed to find something I liked at every dinner (why do people expect every meal they eat at a resort to be the best meal of their lives?). The rooms are so-so, small yet clean - starting to show their age but not an issue as we don't spend our vacation in the room. The only real negatives were the Mexican restaurant - the main server (do they have Captains at this resort?) was rude and slow. At this resort, if you are late for your reservation they cancel it, which is fair, yet we showed up on time (for an 8:45PM reservation) and were made to wait 15 minutes for no apparent reason. The appetizers are buffet and the main is ordered (they will not take your order until you have finished your apps). They served each table individually (it takes 4 servers to bring fajitas??) before even cooking the next table's meal. With 2 hours invested and still 3 tables to go before we got our meals - we left to rude glares from the \"head waiter\". One dinner and one stupid set-up doesn't ruin the resort or even the night, but I thought it worth mentioning. The other only real negative is that the wine is awful. Really awful - drink something else or buy wine. In conclusion - it is not a 5 star resort in my opinion, but looking at the price point I thought it was a good value. So many people seem to want a Cadillac for the price of a Kia. I saw a review where someone mentioned the Valentin Imperial is much better resort. I have been there and it is much nicer, but it is also double the price. Finally, I would not go back to this resort.

The food was fantastic and although the base (salads etc) were the same every night, there was always something different to have if you wanted it. The choice of freshly squeezed juices in the morning was fab. Our room was on the bottom floor overlooking the pool area which was great. We heard the nightlife at night after we had gone to bed, but we were so tired it didn't keep us awake. I must say, I didn't find the beds too hard. The nightlife was not the best I have seen and we tended not to go and watch after we had seen a few. Someone has said that they had to get up early for sunbeds, however, in the past when we have gone to Turkey my husband has had to get up at 7am to lie with the beds to save them. However, we were walking through the pool area after 9am, and sometimes after 10am and there were still loungers available on the pool area and the beach. The beach was fantastic and really clean. The pool was really cold and I only ventured in there once. Of all the all inclusive holidays we have stayed in (mostly Turkey and Cyprus) this is by far the best. The cocktails were included and also the mini bar in the room even had spirits. In past all inclusives we have had to pay for cocktails and drinks in the mini bar and have never had spirits. We went to the Asian restaurant for a meal and did not rate it - the food in the main restaurant was far better. The only real problem for us was the smoke from cigarettes. My kids went to the lobby area to use the WiFi and it was really smoky. I would like to see a ban. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

Down sides, pools were freezing to the point were no one would get in to take part in any of the activities, they really need to be heated.

This said, the shower was situated right next to the wadrobe area and therefore all our clothing was damp the entire holiday and the bathroom / shower area had no extractor fan or window. The rest of the room also suffered from damp, to such a degree that the sheets were damp and therefore the beds were not very pleasant to sleep in. We also had electrical sockets hanging out of the wall, again the alternative was to move to a suite but it was way out of our price range. Breakfast choice was very good, lunch if you decided to have this at poolside restaurant, was very repetative and a bit bland.

The bathroom was large and we had a double wide balcony! We were in the 9200 building which is in the back of the resort, so there was a long walk to the restaurants, lobby, beach, etc., and no view of the ocean, but on the flip side, it was also very quiet and peaceful at night.

We did not try the other restaurants as we don't like to be tied down to a specific time to dine. The pools looked great, but it was rather cool while we were there and the pool water too cold for us. The beach is outstanding, plenty of chairs in the sun and the shade. Nice, soft, sand and beautiful waves. The ocean water was often warmer than the air during our stay. We can't say enough about the staff and service. All outstanding. We found that if we tipped the bartenders every so often, the service was even better! We recommend taking a taxi ($5) into Playa Del Carmen, although there was a walkway there, it was waaaay too far to walk, probably a good 20 minute walk.

Excellent people watching as well, and our 21 year old daughter had fun 'bargaining' with the vendors for her purchases.

The Riu Yucatan was not our first choice. We had been booked to stay at the Grand Sunset Princess but decided to change resorts as a result of the explosion. We were not giving many options by Sunwing as to which resort we could switch to free of charge and ended up at the Riu. However, this is definitely not a 5 star hotel and should not be advertised as such. People have certain expectations of a 5 star and will be disappointed when these expectations are not met. Rated as a 4 star this resort will get better reviews. The Riu Palace was next door to our resort - now that looked like a 5 star. On paper, the Princess seems like a higher end resort than the Riu, ie newer, more a la cartes, and is also closer to the airport. We were disappointed that Sunwing was not willing to give us a partial refund for the difference in price as the Riu was cheaper, or offer us more options with respect to switching. Westjet and Air Canada apparently were much more flexible with their clients who had booked at the Princess and wanted to switch resorts. The beach at the Yucatan is amazing! A definite 10 out of 10. A few in our group were subjected to sand flea bites which are very nasty. They seem to affect a small minority of people...fortunately I wasn`t one of them. The pools are beautiful - spacious and clean with 2 swim up bars. However the pools were quite cold. This is not a criticism of this resort in particular - I don`t think many resorts offer heated pools - too bad. I enjoyed water aerobics in the pool one day, a good way to warm up in the pool! The rooms are adequate and fairly comfortable. Not the best bed I`ve ever slept on, but certainly not the worst either. I would have preferred a true king bed rather than 2 doubles pushed together. The room was kept clean and there is a minibar with a good selection of cold drinks. There was no musty smell that I`ve experienced at other resorts. We went to the Mexican a la carte the first night and it was a disappointment. You can only make reservations for 6:45 or 8:45. I`ve never experienced that type of restriction at other resorts. The salad and appetizers were buffet, and were tasty. The house white wine was undrinkable. I am not a wine snob but that stuff was awful. No wine list to be able to buy something more suitable. The main course was disappointing. We ordered fahitas and they brought the meat and tortillas to the table and we were told to help ourselves to the cheese, guac, salsa etc from the buffet. The meat was very salty and the tortilla shells were awful. The tortilla shells at the buffet were much better. Service was a little slow, and we were not offered tea or coffee at the end of the meal. Some of our group tried the Asian and had a similar experience, so we decided to stick with the buffet. Fortunately the main buffet was very good! They always found a table to accommodate our group. The food was excellent - lots of selection, always very hot and the line ups were never very long. There were different themes each night so there was always something new to try. The fresh fruit and salds were soo fresh and tasty. The fish was excellent. There was a few desserts that were exceptional, and the ice cream was very good! Also really enjoyed the cappuchino. Service at the buffet was generally good. We also ate lunch at the beach club/margartia most days. It was great to be able to eat outdoors with a view of the fabulous beach! The pizza was my favourite. The hamburgers were not the best beef - they had a BBQ on the 24th and the burgers at the BBQ were sooo much better! Drinks/bars were great - with the exception of the aforementioned wine. The shows were not great - I've seen better at other resorts. We went over to the Riu Tequila one night and saw the Vegas show - it was better than any of the shows we saw at the Yucatan. The Tequila seems to be more of a party resort with more nightlife. We checked out the disco and the sportsbar. We did a \"half day\" snorkelling trip to the National Park near Puerto Morelos. The actual snorkelling was great! However we were told by our Sunwing rep that it was a half an hour bus ride but turned out to be 2 hours with all the resorts we stopped at. Had we of known we would have arranged for our own transportation. All in all, we spent a great week with extended family. For my taste, I prefer a little more luxury but this is definitely a good resort if the price is right!

We were part of a group of 12 people (extended family). The members of the groupe were between 24 and 65 years old. We were originally supposed to stay in the Grand Sunset Princess resort. However, after the explosion (Grand Riviera Princess), we decided to switch resorts and settled on the Riu Yucatan. This resort was rated lower and sold at a cheaper price. We were not, however, able to be reimbursed the difference. Nonetheless, we were very satisfied with our stay. BEACH The best feature of this resort is the beach. It is deep and wide. There are plenty of chairs. Many palm trees provide shade. The sand is soft and almost white. Aside from many cigarettes, the beach is relatively clean. The drinks are served in reusable plastic glasses and workers walk back and forth all day to pick them up. There are 2 volley ball courts and you have access to the Margarita and Beach club snack bars during the entire day. There were not many waves but the flag was yellow our entire stay. We were able to swim often. You can also walk up the beach for a long time, in front of other resorts. I read that someone had complained about sand fleas. I was not affected by this. Actually, out of our group of 12, only 2 people were bitten by sand flees. One of these people had a lot of bites. It does not seem to be very frequent however because I did not see many people with bites. I stayed on the beach every day, took walks and even played in the sand a bit and had no problems. ACTIVITIES Various activities happen during the day. Some people did water aerobics and really enjoyed it. Other members of our group played in a ping pong tournament. The volley ball was also very popular. We took Spanish lessons one afternoon and had a lot of fun with the instructor Luis. I really enjoyed the \"Handicrafts\" corner. It's a family business that sells ceramic pieces that you then paint. The two brothers in charge of the stand take your art home the same night, put varnish on them, and bring them back the next day. I spent 2 wonderful afternoons painting 3 pieces : a tucan, a fish and a candle dome. I loved it! Aside from the beautiful beach, this is my second favourite memory from my trip. ROOMS The rooms are spacious and clean. You have just enough room. The beds are enormous (2 double beds put together). There was no bath tub in our basic room, but a spacious shower. Our room was made every day, which was grately appreciated. There is a mini fridge, restocked every 2 days with water, 7up, Pepsi, Orange Crush, Beer and more. You also have liquor dispensers, free of charge. If you run out of water, simply get more bottles at the front desk. The television was resonable, with a lot of english american channels. Some people find the rooms dated and I do not agree. The bathroom looked like it had been renovated in the last 5 years. What I liked about the hotel is it's mexican charm. It's not a cookie-cutter resort. You feel in Mexico when you stay there. The main lobby is just wonderful. RESTAURANTS The buffet offered a variety of food to please everyone. Some nights were more mexican, others more asian. However, you could always find pizza, pasta, tacos, fajitas, salad, meat, fish, bread, cheese, cold cuts, fruits and plenty of desert. For breakfast, I had a wonderful ham and cheese omelet every morning, with pancakes, homemade donoughts, waffles or croissants. I am not an adventurous eater so when I like something I tend to stick to it. Therefore, by the end of the week, I was getting a bit tired to eat the same thing. However, you can easily find something different to eat every night. The a-la-carte restaurants were not that great. The resort only has 3 restaurants : Mexican, Asian and Steak. We tried the mexican restaurant and were not impressed. We had the 2nd seating (8:45pm) and it took a long time to get our food. The fajitas were not very good, the tortilas tasted like cardboard. Others in our group who had arrived a day earlier had tried the asia restaurant and were not impressed either. It was buffet style. We did not try the steak house. We decided to stick to the buffet. Lunch is served at the Margarita/Beach Club and the Buffet. The Beach Club offers the basics : hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza, fries, fish and a sandwhich and salad bar. You get a bit tired of that same food by the end of the week. Plenty of soft drinks, juice, water, coffee and beer dispensers. Also, it has a soft serve ice cream machine where you can make your own ice cream cones. They look better than they taste. POOLS I only swam twice and very briefly. The water was cold. There is plenty of chairs and a lot of shade. I found there were a lot of little black bugs, which annoyed me. They liked my sunscreen it seems. We spent most of our time at the beach instead. ENTERTAINMENT The night shows are average. Don't expect too much. I really enjoyed the Grease show. We saw a show at the Riu Techila one night that seemed better (Vegas Style). If you want to dance, the Riu Techila has a night club. It is only a 10 minute walk from the Riu Yucatan. There are many bars on the Riu Yucatan resort, including 2 swim-up bars. They make a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. The drinks were strong. We were very pleased with the drinks that we were served. The beer is very good but the wine is not. I liked the Mango and Strawberry Daquiris, as well as the Super Conga smoothie. EXCURSIONS Different travel companies offer different excursions. We flew with Sunwing. Most of us took a half day snorkling trip. It was nice but we were gone for many hours (7:50am to 3pm). What was supposed to be a 30 minute bus ride became a 1h45min bus ride because we picked up people from 5 other resorts. The snorkling itself was on a natural reserve and was enjoyable. Three members of our group did a Jungle/ATV excursion that was all day. They had a great time. SERVICE Overall, the service was very good. You do not feel pressured to give tips, which is nice. The employees are nice. The restaurant staff at the buffet was always able to find a sport to seat our entire group of 12. The entertainment staff is friendly. Luis, part of the entertainment staff, was a pleasure to talk to. The beach towel service is very convenient. You simply exchange your card for a towel and bring it back before 5:30pm to receive a new card for the next day. The main lobby has free wifi internet. Overall, The Riu Yucatan is a very good hotel. Over there, Riu claims it is a 5 star resort. I do not find it is. If you go there expecting a 4 star resort you will be very satisfied. Although the restaurants are not great, the buffet had plenty of options and excellent deserts. Our most important feature was the beach and the Riu Yucatan did not disapoint!

The hotel might not be an American class 5 but let's remember: this is Mexico. The staff are friendly, helpful and very sweet! The ONLY problem we had was when we tried to ask for the possibility to be seated in ONE restaurant and order from two. Since they were in the same location, just around the bend from eachother we thought that might be doable. Because DH loves meat and I am a demi-vegetarian he couldn't try the Steak House otherwise and it was his birthday so we were hoping they could allow that, but the answer was a very firm \"no\". (Quite sure a bunch of the other staff would have said yes, so I think we were just unlucky that day, to be honest!) The only other issue we had were annoying neighbours. At first we thought that the cleaning ladies had actually entered our room, despite our do not disturb sign, buuuut we pretty quickly found out that it must have been our \"fun and funny\" neighbours who had taken the sign down. They seemed to get their kicks from messing with us. Now, that means that the issue isn't the hotel's - but I thought we'd mention it since we thought it was, at first. The beds are hard, but we both like that. The TV has pretty bad reception but we turned it on once only - and we didn't really care. The food is great and there'sa lot to choose from. The Asian restaurant has AMAZING sushi and the sweetest staff!! Our fave bar, by FAR, is Tequila. Both Benito and Florencio are suuuper sweet, professional, funny and just lovely - and make some mean drinks! We had a LOT of fun in that bar - make sure you ask for the Mexican Flag or the Tequila Boom Boom...! ;) Love that they have such a good selection of tasty non-alcoholic drinks too! What else? The beach is very nice! The water's clear and the sun chairs are plenty and comfy. There are LOTS of free activities well! Oh - the animals on the hotel? SO cute! If you like animals, make sure to take the about 25 minute walk down to the Aviary on Xaman-Ha. It rocks! Remember: TIP your staff when they do a good job. The ash tray in the room?

The word lazy is definitely under used in this situation! Beds were comfy, rooms were cleaned everyday and to a high standard. Gardens were lovely with numerous kinds of animals!! Staff wre the friendliest people which i think is just mexican people as a whole who are just genuine nice people. Went on two trips. one being a horse riding trip to Rancho Baxaal which was fantastic!! Guide was v friendly and informative. Second trip was to Chichen itza, again the guide made the day absolutely brilliant. only tip i have is not to book it through thomson as they are very expensive. we booked down the road at the playacar plaza and i recommend this as we were given a great package by senor rodriguez.

All staff is very friendly and not pushy for a tips. I wish we had bit more cash with us ;) Recomend you to take a small change with you like a dolar notes. They dont ask for tips and give you the same good service. We went for a few trips 3 in total and 2 recomended by our tour oparator. Dont be pushed to buy any trips that what we did and could be with out. Trips which i recomende is Trainer for life- full day with delfines and another see animals. Lovely and all family can enjoy. Only think dont book it with thomson, first choice, thomas cook they had ask for some part of the trip to be removed so if you go to the place you get the full day for the same money. It is excelente. Do not go on a Captain Hook trip if is raining. You will not see any show. If is a nice night you can have a lot of fun. Fat Cat is nothing special- not very good for snorkeling. To much drinking and bit of food. Bit expensive for what it is. Staff ok and friendly. Definitely have a massage in a hotel. We had one . I wish that we didnt left it to a last minute. Weather was good with a lot od wild life to see around the hotel and a see. There are 3 tipes of monkeys in a hotel. Dont worry you wont miss them they waiting for they breakfast in a morning. Take a bread with you to the see. The fish will eat it from your hand. Fifth avenue is good for shopping and only cost around \u00a34 in taxi from the hotel.

It is not a 5 star hotel not even 4 maybe 3? When we arrived it was 4am so we received our keys and went straight to our rooms. As soon as the door to our room was open we could smell something like sewage backup /rotten eggs. We looked around couldn\u2019t see nothing. Went to front desk and was advised to check with them in the morning. Morning came we went out forgot about the room until 6pm when we went to take shower. The smell was still there. Once again we went to the front desk and talked to one of the afternoon managers name \u201cJerry\u201d. Nicely we explained our situation to Jerry, That our room smells , they provided us with 2 separate beds when it was just me an my husband, that it was my husbands birthday and we just want to have a \u201csmell free and same bed to sleep\u201d. Jerry abruptly said. \u201cWe do not have any room available and there is nothing I could do\u201d. We went for dinner and back to the room still the smell was unbearable. I went back to the front desk and talked to Jerry again. This time I said \u201cI am willing to give u a good tip if you find me a room\u201d. Right away he said \u201cfor $50 us dollars tip you could have room # 5304 or 4306\u201d. I paid him $50 and changed my room to 5304. My point here is that this is 5 star hotel workers shouldn\u2019t be able to do things like this as it is disgusting. The beach was great we had lots of fun great sand, good location, great food and excellent entertainment team. We enjoyed the daily activities. Entertainment team always made us laugh and reminded as how cold it was where we came from. Horrible rooms stinky, bed was just a spring box I rather sleep on the chairs outside, hotel really outdated. If it didn\u2019t have the great beach is not worth even talking about it. My husband had booked us couple of 50minutes massage at the Riu Yucatan spa for 3 pm one afternoon. When we arrived at the reception we were so happy, we were having great time. The reception, \u201cRosalina\u201d Greeted us in a way that I will not forget. She screamed at us \u201cYES\u201d My husband said \u201cexcuse me we have booked for 3pm massage\u201d and she replied. \u201cDON\u2019T YOU KNOW HOW TO READ THE TIME IS 2:55\u201d. \u201cGO UPSTAIRS\u201d, she said. I thought she might be on PMS so we ignored her. The therapist was great and the massage was excellent. We loved the massage so much that we wanted to do it again but didn\u2019t really want to talk to Rosalina again. We decided to go to the Hotel next door Sandos and use their spa. One of the Riu represantive named Georgina was listening to me, she was so sweet. She assured me that this time I will have great time and reception will be different. So I give in and booked massages, a facial, pedicure and manicure one of their packages for $240 us dollars. I went in Rosalina looked at me like I shouldn\u2019t be there. She had a very negative energy and she never smiled. Nevertheless, had my massage was great then went for the facial was awesome. When I went to do my nail Rosalina came and said \u201conly pedicure you did not pay for manicure\u201d. She was really mean. I tolled her to find Georgiana because she showed me the packages and it was included for pedicure and manicure. Rosalina said \u201ca Georgina no Georgina you don\u2019t get Manicure you need to pay more\u201d. That\u2019s when I flipped and demanded to see their manager. Rosalina then said \u201cok fine you get manicure\u201d. She basically ruins all my experience at the spa, which I will never go back to. I would love to go back to this location but next time will stay at a different hotel. Riu Yucatan has very poor front desk receptions both checking and spa. They rip you off, like their evening manager Jerry who seriously took my $50. They have Rosalina who tried to rip you off she didn\u2019t succeed this time.

There were a total of 6 in our group, 3 adults, 12 year old, 3 year old, and 2 year old. We started off very excited when we arrived as the resort looked beautiful. However, because of having to attend to the small children once we got off the bus (took us almost 2 hours from Cancun airport and the kids had to use the bathroom), we missed the talk from the front desk staff about how the resort operated. When we approached for our room assignment she rolled her eyes and asked why we didn't listen when she talked the first time. We said that we missed the beginning because we were busy with the kids. She went through it all again and we were on our way. We were quite optimistic as a waiter has brought us a tasty drink and the chistmas themed decorations were lovely. We got to the rooms and they were nice. Okay by any standards but nothing spectacular. A bit on the small size but that was okay. It doesn't take much to please us. I could even overlook the rust in the bathroom and missing grout from the shower tiles. Didn't even get annoyed when I had to used by hair elastic to wrap under the shower head to keep it from slipping down all the time. I was still optimistic because the grounds were beautiful, the beach was amazing and the ocean a dream. What disappointed me was the service we received!! The only drink I was ever served (except for the odd drink at dinner) was the one I recieved while checking in. The was no drink service by the beach, by the pool or at the outdoor amphitheater. If you wanted a drink you had to go get it from the bar. The food at the steakhouse was great and the service there subpurb!! The rest of the service was a total let down. Attitude was not an issue as, with the exception of the front desk clerk, all staff were very friendly. Clearing of plates at the buffet was also hit and miss!! The Hacienda buffet was okay, again, average. Got very monotanous by the end of the week. We also found that the lunch buffet seemed quite often to be left overs from the previous nights dinner service. The beach club lunch/breakfast was horrendous!!! Stay away! My child got sick in the middle of the night one night and we needed bedding replaced. It took 15 minutes of trying to reach the front desk before anyone answered and then over one hour for someone to bring us clean blankets. The kids club area was nothing special. The kids pool was tiny!! I understood that we could use the facilities at all the riu properties but could not go into the hotel part of the Riu palace properties. When we arrived we were told that we could not use any of the facilities at the 2 Riu palace resorts. Were also told there was no shuttle between the Riu resorts. If we wanted to go to another we had to take a cab. All in all, the beach was amazing, the massage was one of the best ever, the property was quite pretty but I would not go back.

You want an extra blanket on your bed, they make it the same everyday, your fan is squeaking a bit loud just tell them, you just ask once and its sorted. We have been to lots of all inclusive resorts and never known anywhere where you just have to ask once, its sorted asap, and they follow up with a phone call to make sure you are happy - even if your query was only to ask for more water. The staff couldn't have been more friendly either. The bar staff are so quick you hardly ever see a queue despite the resort being really busy. The weather was lovely and hot while we were there (30s) despite reading rain forecasts on all the weather forecast websites before we left! I would say if you are a pool person the beds round the pool are busty and its also hard to escape the shade/noise up there. We tried it a day or so (often being pool people) but as the beach is so close found it far more relaxing, better for sunbathing and a nice breeze down on the beach. The food is lovely and although there is a lot of repetition these are the basics and the choice is so wide that you eat something different most nights. The Argentinian steak they use in the resort is gorgeous! It took half an hour to walk from the hotel to Playa del Carmen at a decent pace (it was approx \u00a32.50 each way in a taxi) although Playa del Carmen was a bit hassley/forced fun for us.

On arrival, William greeted the party and we were all given the information we require as a group which was much better and kept us waiting to get into our rooms to a minimum. This was a great idea. Wendy conducted the welcome meeting and gave you all the information you needed about the hotel and resort and was always available when you needed to ask her anything. Even if it was to ask about tipping - we didn't have a clue what to tip! Our room was spotless on arrival, plenty of booze in mini-bar and soft drinks in fridge. We requested diet drinks and this was arranged immediately. Stocked every 2 days but we did drink all our water and it was replenished immediately. Room was cleaned every day and bed linen changed every 2 days. Lots of nice towel animals left on the bed - a different one each day. Could not fault the food, there was plenty of choice. We did eat at the steak house which you could book to eat at any evening you wish, this was OK. It is a set menu so once you have had it, if you go another evening, you can change your main course only for variety. The menu is set and they serve you each course as you are ready for it. We ate a couple of tims in the chinese restaurant. Again, this is a set menu which doesn't change and is buffet style, so you eat what you want and as much as you want. We didn't try the mexican restaurant so can't comment on that one. A good variety of choice for breakfast. Lunch is basically the same each day, but if you're not fussy, you can have something different each day. Drink is in abundance - as much or as little as you can drink. We did the F1 boat trip - only negative was that it cost \u00a3170 for the 2 of us for 1/2 day. The actual trip was fantastic. Travelling along on a speed boat, snorkelling and swimming with turtles, stingrays, abundance of sealife. All in all, a really great trip but a bit on the expensive side. Parasailing was also a good experience but again, a bit pricey. If you're planning on wanting to do a lot of trips, take plenty of extra cash with you. You can book with other agencies outside of the hotel, but it's at your own risk. Weather - it did rain a couple of days but it was hot - we've come back with a great tan.

Trips out were ridiculously over-priced. \u00a375 to go to the pyramids at Coba. Its far cheaper to hire a car and drive yourself, its not far and the driving is very, very easy with little traffic. Car hire for 2 days is \u00a380 approx, we shared with a couple we met (Hi Lins and Ash!!) and had a great day out, Tulum is also doable in the same day. Make time to go to a cenote for a swim but find one that is just a cenote, not an expanded, family entertainment extravaganza as that spoils the experience. Chichen Itza is worth a visit although we had done this on our last stay. The food in the hotel was on the whole good, nothing different than any other all inclusive hotel really. Waiting on staff were all very nice although when they clap you as you enter the dining room, that was weird!. There is a nice bar area near the stage and the bar staff there entertain you and provide Mexican remedies for any ills you may have - all involve alcohol but surprisingly they did work!! There is an area near the bar that has a really awful smell, I actually gagged walking past it one day, its a drainage problem that wasn't looked at in all the time we were there. There must have been complaints in the past about lack of umbrellas/shade as you couldn't move for them round the pool. Too many in fact to be able to get a bed in the sun all day - if you wanted that you had to go onto the beach where contrarily, there were no umbrellas. The sunbeds in the pool area were far too close together for my liking, I like a bit of personal space, especially if your neighbour is smoking. Pools were nice with swim up bars in both. Rooms were quite dated but I don't have an issue with that as they were clean. There are 5 Riu hotels in the area, Tequila is across the road and has a sports bar that you can use with snooker tables and a few other games, air hockey etc. That hotel pool area looked worse than ours for crammed in beds and no decent sunshine area. We took a walk around the Palace hotel next door and if we had the extra money available, we would definately choose to stay there, far nicer but then you pay for all that niceness! There is a bookshelf by the entertainment hut if you want to exchange your holiday reading. My main issue was that this holiday cost a lot more than we paid to go to Jamaica to the Riu Ocho Rios and the Ocho Rios was a far superior hotel for food, pool, location, everything. We didn't have a bad experience here, I just think its over priced for what you get.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cSun, Sea and fun.\u201d", "Author": "bestcan", "ReviewID": "UR86079382", "Content": "We have just got back from a stay at the RIU Yucatan. We really had a good time considering that it was our first time in Mexico ever. The hotel is an \"older\" hotel (1997) but is still in nice condition and well maintained. To get into the hotel grounds you must past through a security check point but once you are in there is a short drive or walk to the hotel itself. A large lobby greets the guests where there is a small bar and \"The Hacienda\" restaurant . The rooms are clean and pretty well situated for the pool and beach, not to far to walk , and there was two large pools and a hot tub, with access to a couple of bar area's and swim up bars as well. One problem we had overall was the smoking that takes place around the pool and bar area's, it was a bit much for us. The beach is right at the back of the pool area, and was easily accessed by some steps. It was all very clean and very safe with lifeguards on duty. Plenty of sunbeds everywhere and Palm tree's for shade on the beach and parasol's by the pool.The food was very good but the Ala Cate meals where good but not really Ala Cate. In the evening's there was a show for an hour preceded by a children's hour . All good entertainment, but if you affected by smoking by others it can be off putting. The staff were very helpful and friendly and were a pleasure to be around. The bed's mattress's in the room's were very hard to sleep on, and we had to ask for a foam top to be put on them to make them livable! Playa de Carmen is only about a 20 minute walk outside of the hotel or a $5 taxi ride, and it is all very safe, but the vendor's outside the shops are extremely \"pushy and aggressive\" for you to deal with them. But if you ignore them they give up and move on to the next person. We found the sound of the Seadoo's going in and out of the shore to be a nuisance, but only to be expected at this kind of resort.

The entertainment team worked tiresly. Our 2 children 12 and 10 had a great time joining in all the games and making friends. The location of this complex is right on the beach which is just stunning! The pools and surrounding areas are kept extremely clean at all times. The food was plentiful and of a very high standard. Diet before you go!!! Even the fussiest of people wouldn't go hungry. My son has a severe allergy and Roger, made himself available every evening to assist him with what he could eat. Even on his days off he arranged for someone else! We found the rooms to be excellent, the maid cleaned the room every day and we looked forward to the towel art that would greet us. The minibar in the room is stocked every other day but should you require anything all you need to do is ring reception and they are more than happy to get this for you.

This was far more quicker than queueing up one by one and having to fill out form by form, we all filled some quick details and we were on our way, a man took our cases for us. The rooms were so big, the air conditioning was brill which also had a fan on the ceiling, we had only been in there 5 minutes and a man came round to see if all our lights worked and if any problems, we were also greeted by a cute little towel display which was changed as much as possible throughout our 2 weeks.The beds were big and there was plenty of hanging space and drawers, there was a safe where you didnt have to leave any deposit. Maids were friendly and the room was always cleaned, couldnt quite work out wether we were getting new towels but they seemed clean and were folded up back on the bathroom shelf each day. You could also help yourself to the mini bar and the fridge full of drinks which was excellent as usually you have to pay for a mini bar in a hotel, the bottles of water were ideal to take out on the trips and on the beach. The only thing was that they didnt have tea and coffee facilities in the room, but dont worry there are bars in the hotel which open up early so you can get your caffine intake. The balcony also didnt have a light outside it was a bit of a shame but not a problem. We flew with Thomson which I dont think I would fly again with personally, the Mexican rep in our hotel wasnt very helpful, we went down to the meeting and she wasnt very helpful when I had done some research on tripadvisor and asked her about a trip to see the monkeys and she just replied back that we dont do anything like that, and didnt advise us as to where we could get information for doing it, the trips were over priced and had extra hidden costs of taxes for this, and also on one trip had to get our own taxi, ive not really known a company that does that, also I told the reps that a safari trip that we did had been badly described by thomson, also she rang us to change two trips over the night before as they hadnt got enough going on one of the trips, we felt abit messed about by her. Anyway back to the hotel, the pool was big and yes it has floating bugs etc... but its impossible to get every last little thing out of the water. there were plenty of sun loungers to choose from, we did get round the pool for 8am and there was enough sunning positions to choose from. The entertainment staff were warm friendly and welcomming, Rico Pop will have you in stitches hes so funny especially when he does the famous bingo, they are busy entertaining by the pool in the day and doing kids club and dancing at night, and may I add the shows as Rico says EXCELLENTE, the Micheal Jackson show not to be missed, there is never a dull moment in this hotel. Yes they mime but they do dance about alot which explains why they dont sing. Sometimes it got rowdy round the pool whilst people were trying to do the Bingo and relax which was a bit annoying, as them people knew people couldnt hear the numbers and sometimes you just wanted a bit of peace and quiet, but I couldnt fault the hotel staff and the way they dealt with suituations, there were also a couple of people letting themselves down, a couple that were there were falling about the pool drunk, and the girl couldnt get up off the sunlounger and was being sick by the pool, the staff were very good and refused to give them anymore alcohol and sent them away from the pool. All 3 restaurants were nice we liked the steak the best, the whole meal was filling and had lots of courses to eat. The buffet restaurant were full of choice and at breakfast if you like every kind of egg then you wont be dissapointed. The hotel was some steps down to a lovely beach, take care when getting into the sea as it is a bit up and down as you walk further out, but the sand is actually cool on your feet and soft not pebbly. There were rui hotels scattered outside your hotel as you walked out of the gates, the best of it you can use these other rui hotel pools and drinks, but you cannot go into the palace hotel, but the hotel does provide you with a visit there if you ask the staff if you can look around. Also its nicely situated a 10 minute walk and you get to shops and theye even got a starbucks for thoose coffee drinkers. It didnt matter what time in the day it was the staff were working 24/7 they were cementing by the pool at night, also painting and keeping the gardens maintained, you could see staff going in and out of rooms with paperwork checking everything was ok, we also had a phonecall from reception staff to see if everything was ok and if we needed anything then let them know. No job was too small. we were really sad to go. we hope to be back sometime in the future but we do like to go to different destinations. x x", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bridgend, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTwo weeks in heaven\u201d", "Author": "anonymous186458", "ReviewID": "UR84812203", "Content": "We stayed at the Yucatan between Oct 2nd and 16th.

This hotel lived up to all the reviews I had read before I went and more.My highest praise goes to all the Animation team, they worked night and day to ensure that everyone had a fantastic holiday and I highly recommend the evening shows- and dont be shy about sitting down the front because they really are best viewed from close up to fully appreciate all the hard work that goes into every 1st class performance. The bar staff are fantastic and it was their pleasure to serve you as quickly as possible and nothing was too much trouble,try the flaming Mayan Sacrifice shots which are drunk through the flames with a straw !!! There is nothing about the hotel that I can fing fault with, the front desk staff ( Willian in patricular ) ring regularly to your room to check everything is okay and if you are in need of anything,the grounds and gardens are spotless and the beds in the rooms were even pulled out and swept under everyday!! We were worried about the reports of mosquito bites by previous reviews but we took the Jungle Fever Tropical spray and were not really troubled at all,I think its just a case of whether you are prone to getting bitten or not. We went on the F1 trip and had a fantastic time,the English guide (think his name was Simon) from Essex was fantastic and made the trip a really fun day although I'm sure he has a death wish-great guy!!! All in all the food was great,beach was lovely and clean with plenty of beds available all day-no need to get up at the crack of dawn to save a bed although I think the prime spots around the pool that face the beach were probably bagged early in the morning. Take a bread roll into the sea with you to feed the fish,they jump out of the water to feed. No need to shop around for sun tan lotion or anything you run out of as we found that the shop in the hotel reception was cheaper than outside. all in all a fantastic hotel with wonderfull staff who cant do enough for you and great food,I highly recommend this hotel and if I were the type of person to return to the same hotel on another holiday I would not hesitate to go back to the YUCATAN.

Firstly - Definitely diet before you go - endless food, and cocktails made by the most brilliant bar staff, especially Benito and Florencio at the Tequila bar have added nearly a stone to my weight!. Benito and Florencio are the most amazingly friendly bar staff- great fun and inventive with the shots! (Try the tequila boom boom and the Mexican flag). Contrary to what others have said on here about nothing happening after half past ten- I can only assume they went to bed when the show's entertainment ended but what they should have done is stay around the Tequila bar until around 12, then move on to either the sister hotel the Tequila just over the road where there is a nightclub until 2am, then back to the Yucatan lobby bar until 7am (if by then you still need more!). Everybody we met around this bar was great fun and we enjoyed many a night like this. The atmosphere at the Yucatan suits all age groups. Myself and my husband went with our son and daughter-in-law and our 21 year old single daughter and we all had a fantastic time. Food is extremely plentiful! and on the whole delicious. There was the odd occasion that we were a little disappointed but that can happen anywhere including English restaurants. The two swimming pools were fantastic- as an earlier review says there is one small area that does suffer with a sewer type smell which is unpleasant and I admit I wouldn't have liked a room in that particular area but it just meant we either stayed by the other pool or went to the beach. (More on that later). Both pools have swim up bars-the second pool (which we preferred) has plenty of sunbeds which you don't have to claim at 6 in the morning! although it is probably quieter in October. The work on the pool surround, previously mentioned in earlier reviews, was done on a section by section process and when the pool was closed for the day as much as possible. None of the daytime work interfered with guests use. From this pool stairs lead directly onto the most beautiful beach. Plenty of sun beds here too and we did prefer our days here. However, the only shade here are the palm trees and with temperatures soaring it can be difficult to find a bed in the shade. The sea is amazing and although we had a mixture of extreme sunshine we also had windy days and one day of torrential rain, due to a hurricane warning, but that led to one of the best days we had, surfing waves on body boards. The hotel has a very friendly animation team-some of the activities were things we preferred not to do but there is no pressure if you don't want to join in, I did rifle shooting a couple of times and the water aerobics on the odd occasion when I felt I really should get off my sun bed for a while! Families with younger children may have found this more useful-(club dance etc is something my 25 and 21 year olds did 15 years ago.) Entertainment shows vary - we enjoyed the Abba show, the Michael Jackson tribute and the Movie tribute but for us these were an intermission between dinner and the night time drinks! But as free entertainment goes it's actually quiet good. Although we didn't need to see Mayeli (the thomson rep) often, when we did, our questions were always answered fully and honestly. We booked the dolphin swim and the F1 speedboat. If you go and only intend to do one fun thing make sure it's the F1 with Simon. He is a crazy Steve Irwin type from Essex but again, great fun. It's the most brilliant day out ever and was made all the better for being able to swim with the turtles! Rooms are very large and although, basic, are comfortable, clean and have everything you'll need including optics and full mini bar which is restocked every other day. There is an iron and ironing board in the wardrobe so don't bother taking a travel iron. Although you don't need to take towels we always take our Itsa towels for the sun beds. When these got covered in sand and then wet in the torrential rain, the laundry service washed and dried 3 of these for 75 pesos ( around \u00a31.25 each). If I have any criticism at all it was not with the hotel but with the group of extremely boorish Americans who unfortunately were the sort that gave all Americans a bad name. With alcohol being all inclusive they were drunk all day and night, and, although we also enjoyed the all inclusive alcohol, we did not get to the point where all our holiday became, was getting up, hitting the bar and staying there until no longer able to walk! This group were obnoxious - unable to talk to each other without screaming at each other- one female member of this group was extremely offensive in both her conversation content and her insistence in running around in just a thong at night and baring her breasts at the barmen. They were told once that the management had said they were not to be served any more alcohol to which they loudly told the barman that they could have anything they want. It was also cripplingly embarrassing to hear the way the Americans spoke to the Mexican people. No manners whatsoever. But to be fair, we may have been unlucky being there at the same time as this particular group, as of course, there were many Americans there who were the complete opposite.

The entertainment team and bar staff are especially excellent, we laughed our entire holiday, they are so whitty.

Also the air conditioning in the room is really good, we left it on low all the time we were not in the room and it must make it too cold for the mosquitos as we had none at all in the room.

CoCo Bongos is a must (for every age)at \u00a340 each including drinks and express enterance (740 peso) great night the shows start at 11 and go through till 3 am no breaks and disco till 5am the bar man brings the drinks to you all night and does expect a tip at the end. It is in 5th Avenue which is 50 peso taxi ride (\u00a32.50) even at 4am same price. There are shops and bars at 5th Avenue if you want to walk around stay open till 10ish (shops) We went to Xhel Ha for the day approx \u00a352.00 each fantastic all inclusive day in the lagoon snokling, underwater caves, tight rope , floating bridge, swim with dolphins (extra \u00a3150.00) ride in inflatable ring all with life jackets and towles.beauitful, lunch and drinks all around the lagoon. My only complaint was it rained 2 1/2 days out of 10 but it was rainy season. Taxi to Cancun \u00a325.00 and use the Riu hotels there free of charge for a day out in Cancun. If in doubt try it out you wont be disappointed if you like having fun and meeting people young and old. Please email me if you have any questions.

THE POOL!! well one word DISGUSTING!! everything from Nachos to cigarette butts in it a green scum around the edge, many complaints were put in about it and everyday it was sort of cleaned, resulting in scum floating on the top of the water!! The swim up bar was only manned and open when the hotel was at capacity so for the last 4 days of our holiday it was closed! The food became very boring after 3/4 days same thing night after night day after day.

We found the hotel staff to be so friendly and helpful from check-in to departure, they could not be faulted. We think the hotel was built in 1997 and the rooms are a little dated. There were 2 small double beds pushed together and a bathroom that doesn't have a door as such, although the toilet does. The air conditioning was ace and the mini bar was topped up every other day. There was no wine in the fridge but if you take an empty water bottle to one of the bars they will fill it up for you! The room was cleaned every day to a good standard and we left a dollar a day and got lovely towel animals! We really enjoyed the buffet restaurant. There was so much choice for both breakfast and dinner and had different things every night (except same fry-up every morning hee hee!). We tried the Asian restaurant which is also a buffet but more intimate. Try the deep fried ice cream for dessert! The Mexican restaurant has a buffet for the starters course but they bring over your main and dessert. The Steakhouse is completely served at your table. We had no problems booking our sittings every morning around 9am-ish. They did vary the times from 6.45pm and 8.45pm and sometimes a 7pm. We didn't use the pool at all as we just generally prefer the beach but we did use the pool bars as they are so close to the beach. The bar staff were so hardworking -- they didn't stop all day. They use branded spirits and there is a really long cocktails list and the mai tais are deceivingly alcoholic! The sand on the beach is beautiful and rarely got too hot to walk on. The first few days, the sea was very rough (we think because of the hurricane) but when it calmed down, it was warm and crystal clear. You could still stand 40ft out and could see lots of fish happily swimming amongst you. Some people fed them bread from the restaurant but they seemed very flappy so we didn't do this! The only concern we had with the beach was the lack of shade. There were no parasols available, you just had to work with the shade from the palm trees after lunch, which was usually fine. We went with Thomson and booked the Chichen Itza day trip which was amazing. If you're lucky enough to get Rex the tour guide, you will come away with a lot of information and some of his enthusiasm. He was brilliant. The swim in the cenote was amazing but a little rushed, don't take your time when getting changed and take your pics after! It might not be suitable for young children though as it is a 3 hour coach journey each way and the main part of the day, walking around the ruins, is in the baking sun. Take a hat! It's actually a really good place to get your souvenirs as they have hundreds of small stalls within the grounds at surprisingly good prices. We also did a Fat Cat cruise which was great -- the crew were really good fun. Drinks aplenty and a basic lunch was included. You get to snorkel above the coral and see fish, swim in the sea with beer (they throw it to you!) and it was a lovely relaxing day. If you get a chance, get a cab (from reception) into Playa Del Carmen for 50 pesos (\u00a32.50). Lots of lovely little shops (we bought some nice silver jewellery), bars and restaurants. We found an amazing bar on the beach called Fusion with sunken seats in the sand and candles with a jazz band playing in the background. We were a bit worried about the mozzies but we used the Jungle Formula spray and we escaped with just a few bites here and there. This may be because of the time of year? We did find there were a lot of young Spanish people who were quite noisy and a bit boisterous. They stayed near the swim-up bar mainly and although we never saw any problems, they were quite noisy in the room at night, which happened to be next door to us! Lastly, if you're worrying about going like we were, after reading some of the negative reviews -- please don't! We had an amazing holiday and wish we could have stayed longer. We will also be looking to stay at another Riu in the future as we really liked the standard of the hotel.

Long flight out with Thomsons not the best airline to fly with long haul but they get you there! \u00a35 to upgrade your tvs so you get good films and more entertainment and you have to pay for drinks on board! only get tea/coffee for free on whole 10hr flight! On arrival - dont let the porters at the airport take your bags, take them yourself its not a long walk to the transfer coaches. On arrival to the hotel you are greeted in the lobby and issued your packs with keys and towel cards and a very nice cocktail! Rooms - a lot better than what i expected, we stopped in standard rooms and were impressed after reading some naff reviews on here! We had rooms in block 4 which were in just the right location for us. Definetly try and get a higher floor room. These rooms where away from the monkeys too so they didnt wake you up! Location - perfect beachfront location! looks just like it does in the brochure, plenty of sunbeds available all day! We used the kayaks twice during our stay and didnt bother with the hobiecats as you had to pay a fee to go out with an instructor on your first time. However we did book to go parasailing with scuba caribe and they did us a reasonable price of 60usd per person. We also booked the dolphin trip with them too to cancun option as was a lot better value for money than what thomson rep can offer you! 110usd each for interaction and swim with dolphins plus full day entry on all inclusive in wet n wild and transfers, be aware though that if you want any pictures they are expensive to buy!! fifth avenue is a 5minute taxi drive away which we did one night but not really worth it to be honest, all the shops are the same trying to sell you the usual tat! however there a lot of restaurants if you want a change of scene. We did walk into playacar twice which is about a 10minute walk just pass the tequila hotel which was nice in the evenings. food - not so good! may be the only let down on this holiday. You are safe if you eat in the main buffet restaurant the La Hacienda, however can get a bit the same if your there for 2weeks. However if you are willing to try different things you will be okay. We tried the steakhouse while we were there after reading reviews this was the best of the 3 a la cartes, food was very nice however next day some of us had upset tummys! didnt bother with the mexican after hearing bad reviews which put us of, and my parents tried the asian and said it was fab and felt fine the next day only complaint was they wish they went there more than once! pool - yes the lights do float about in the pool but they are constantly putting them back in. The main jacuzzi was getting worked on while we were there but cause no disturbance to our stay. Sunbeds.. you have to get up early! all though it says no reserving everybody does! only problem we had was with the portugese taking the towels off of our beds if we werent sat on them! entertainment - entertainment team were very good! entertainment during the day was excellent plenty to do and if you didnt want to join in they left you alone. as for night time. not so good, we found this very poor. it seemed to be the same every night the riu team doing the same dance routine just in different outfits or to different music. Michael Jackson show is brilliant and also the mayan show is really good to! half way through our stay we had a bus load of possibly spanish students turn up thinking that it was a club 18-30 holiday but meaning to be a family resort. they did get ever so rowdy as they would sit getting drunk in the pool every afternoon in the swim up bars. on a couple of occasions they were told to quieten down and get out of the pool by some of the bar staff. The bar staff are what made our holiday! On the first night we arrived was the beach party and we soon got to know our cocktails and all of their names. Favourites were Benito, Florencio & Eduardo.. they love speaking the london rhyming slang so try it with them! Well worth trying are the mayan cappucinos, mexican flags, blue oceans & strawberry daquaris!! Hope this has helped.

Please ignore such negativity... this hotel was absol delightful. To begin with the flight was good,considering we travelled with my 19 month old, upon arrival at the airport it is abit manic through customs... specially when you are waiting in a huge queue and other inconsiderate travellers decide that queuing is not something they consider favourable. Watch out for the porters who try and take your cases off you, they expect a huge tip. On the transfer we were greeted by a lovely rep whom gave out free bottles of water and corona ( at a small charge). Upon arrival at the hotel, you are greeted with roses ( ladies) and a very tasty cocktail, very nice after that long flight. The very smiley porters take your cases to you room, in fact they were at our room with the cases before we were very efficient. Rooms were very spacious and clean, loved the optics with Gin, Vodka, Tequila and Rum and mini bar which were stocked every other day. One thing i will say though is that the rooms are not suitable for 3 adults, as recomended. My inlaws and their 22 year old son were expected to share the 2 ( rather small) double beds which are together...abit to close to comfort and you can wave bye bye to any privacy. Though it was prefect for ourselves as we only had our 19 month old. Reception phone daily to make sure you have no problems and if you require anything. The pool area.... ok i do acknowledge previous reviews about the floating lights however they were carrying out maintenence on the jacuzzi and on numerous occasions of a night time we saw them tackling the floating lights. However the next day people were pulling them back out. It is open 52 weeks a year so im sure its quite difficult to completely empty a pool and reassemble lights ( im certain holiday makers would not be too impressed to find they have lack of a pool) . Theres 2 swim up bars were a bonus and staff were always very effiecient and friendly. The beach is pictureress, each morning it is racked and the hotel staff dig a hole and dispose of sea weed or washed up rubbish( really wouldnt like there job). Always sun beds available on the beach. The watersports were not alot to be desired, they were always happy to allow you to take out snorkels and body boards, but anything else......no chance. They always blame the weather or say it is too choppy. Funny though because if you are spanish you can have them out right away, seems they are a little racist. The entertainment staff were extremely friendly and tried their best to get others involved in activities, but were no way pushy, the shows were ok. The beach party was the best night with live music, fireshow and disco till the early hours. The food was good, there was ample choice and was not repetitive in the slightest, we tried the steakhouse and asian restaurant, didnt really rate the asian but the steak house was quite nice. The waiters were incredibly helpful and friendly particularly Henry in the main buffet restaurant, he would have the table set up for you each night and a balloon for my son. In terms of excusion highly reccomend Captain Hook, fab night out, well worth the money. If you book this through the lovely and helpful Thomson rep Wendy you will get front row seats on board the Gallon. We also went to Xel Ha... Was a good day out, particularly if you enjoy snorkling. We also swam with the dolphins at Xel Ha, amazing experience well worth it, though watch out photos and dvd are very pricey. My partner also went on the whale shark experience... which we booked through our rep as they were the only company who garenteed money back if you were unable to encounter whale sharks on the day. However he was successful and said it was probably the worst transfer journey ever as the coach had square wheels but the actual whale shark encounter was one of the most amazing experiences ever. The Mozzies were rife, and we were told not to even bother putting on the stuff brought in the Uk as they have become immune to it, purchase OFF from the resort shop it costs around 160 peos. Beware though, spray it on whilst stood on a towel as if it gets on the floor its like dry ice. Loved the array of wildlife, seen racoons, monkeys and some other little things that ressemble gaint ginuea pigs on a daily basis. Just few pointers if you are taking a young baby whom requires formula milk, contact the hotel to request a kettle before departure, we were unable to get a kettle and had to do a trek over to the restaurant to get hot water ( got bit fustrating as we could only then make bottles during restaurant opening hours. If travelling with young children you may want to request extra towels to put down on the floor in your room as the tiled floors can become extremely slippy if people have showers or you have just come back from the beach or pool. Dont bother taking a hairdryer or travel iron as they are already provided, the hairdryers are actually quite powerful.

I usually stay at the Riu Places resorts. I am so glad we saved our money and stayed at the Yucatan instead of the Mexico palace. The service is great at the Yucatan they don't serve you in the pool or at your chair like the palace but who doesn't need a potty break now and then. The pool at the Yucatan was definitely nicer than the other Riu resorts with the exception of the Mayan Riviera Place. The restaurants were buffet style but the food was similar or identical to the Palace resorts. The rooms were clean & decorated nicely. When we checked into our room we noticed that our refrigerator was empty. One the way to the pool we told the front desk and by the time we were back in our room our frig was full and kept stocked the rest of our visit. We visited the resort the first week in May; the place was busy but not packed you could always find a chair at the pool and get a drink at the swim up bar. As an American traveler who frequents Mexico it was a little surprising to my friends and I to find ourselves as one of the few Americans at this resort. The majority were English, German, Spanish, and South American. It was kind of a nice change. However, heads up women and men let it all hang out when that stuff should be tucked away under a one piece or some long shorts!! Got to love other cultures but, I felt skinny the whole week! This was also my first visit where I was able to enjoy the ocean without the the threat of being drowned by waves. The sandy beaches in Playa del Carmen are much nicer than the ones in Cabo.

Airport This has nothing to do with the hotel but its a warning from me be aware that the airport is pretty unorganised when you get to mexico so just follow the crowd and keep your travel partners close. Then when your finally through finding your coach you will get hassled by the porters DO NOT let them tell you they work for your holiday company as they don't and they will want paying once they have your suitcases, the walk from the building to the coaches is not even 5 minutes so is it really worth giving them your suticase ? Coach to the hotel Once on the coach we had a man called manuel ( a local rep) tell us a few things about mexico and the hotels etc. He was the funniest person to be on the coach with and you learn a few things about the area you will be staying in like dont drink the water and that there is a lot of jungle so dont go wandering around. On my coach we had the chance to purchase beer or water and this was quite handy after the long flight and the hectic airport and it started your holiday off specially for people who like beer :) The Welcome at the hotel You get off the coach and walk into the hotel and each lady receives a rose which puts a smile on your face. Your greeter then talks to you about your room and what you need and how to work things etc. It was my dads birthday the day we flew out and so when we got there he told the lady and she gave him a big hug and sang to him in spanish happy birthday which was quite fun for all. You then make your way to your room (all these people who say they dont take you to your room well if your that stupid that you cant use a map and your mouth to ask before you go where abouts you will find it then well.....)Anyway your suitcases are taken to your room for you by a porter and this time you do not have to pay them anything although we gave him a dollar :) it all adds up. Once you have been in your room for about ten minutes reception ring to make sure that everything is there and everything is ok then the porter turns up. Room These rooms are really nice to stay in however due to being in a tropical place that has high humidity and extremely good air con the room can smell slightly damp and can make your clothes feel and smell partially damp but just keep them in the suitcase or the wardrobe and you will be fine. This is not the hotels fault so please do remember you cannot moan when you chose somewhere tropical. You have two double beds and still plenty of room to move around in. The bathroom is closed off by curtains and then the toilet has a door. You will also have a balcony area. The room comes with a mini fridge, optics, towels, tv, alarm clock, safe, iron and ironing board. Our room was cleaned evrey single day and it was left spotless after he had finished. He often folded our clothes we had left on the bed to make it look tidy which was very kind of him. Not everyday but some we had towel animals and these were all very cool and i saw a good range as between my family we had 3 rooms. Overall the rooms were excellent. Pool 2 huge pools one that has a pool bar in it which was really good to cool off after being hit by the sun each minute your in the pool. Filiberto was the main man who worked there during my holiday and he was manic all day so if youre waiting a while just give him a break he works there all day from half ten till when he shuts. There is also another pool bar but it has its only little pool bar area with tables out of the water i found that this can become extremely busy and also it has a jacuzzi here. There is also a 2nd jacuzzi which was freezing cold but half way through my holiday they were working on it as it had broken in the hurricane 5 years ago so this wasn't available but atleast now you know it will be fully working. The pools were like a warm bath it was lovely to get into. Round the edges of the pool it was slightly mucky, my uncle complained one morning to the managers about it and within 5 minutes there was a member of staff out there scrubbing it with a brush for most of the day and he came back the next to finish off. There are plenty of sun beds available up until about 8ish then you will struggle to find one until about 4 then you should be able to get a few if you wanted to. Beach This beach looks just like it does in the picture absolutely FANTASTIC! beautiful white sand that does not get hot under your feet and a grand blue sea thats extremely warm one day it was about 36 degrees.! Which means that the weather was most probably about 38-40 degrees. Plenty of sun beds on the beach you will always defiinitely get one here any time through the day! DO NOT buy jewellery off the man who tries to sell you silver as it wil turn green on you, stick to the hotel market. Weather I took my holiday in august and the weather was quite all over the place, it was extremely hot when it was hot but when the wind picked up it did blow a gale and the rain poured down quite heavily but i did go away in hurricane tropical weather season so what can i expect after all. There was 8 of us that went and all came back with a fab tan even the whitest of our group came back browner than she has ever been on any holiday previously. Staff They were sooooo helpful and soooo friendly you could ask for anything and they would try their best to help you as much as they could. You could always have a laugh with any of them. Reception rang a few times throughout the holiday to make sure we had everything we wanted and everything was ok and always said if you need anything call us straight away. One day my fridge hadn't been filled like it should have been so i called reception and they had a man to me within ten minutes of my call. My sister went back to her room one day after being at the pool and her electricity had completely gone they went to reception and a man was there within literally 2 miniutes it was pretty amazing. Restaurant Plenty of food choice at all time of the day no matter what you eat you will find something there that you like. They do have the same sort of thing there each day but like they have beef pork turkey chicken bacon each day but in different styles and they dont have them all each day just a few and then the following day different. KNATS a paaain in the back side and nothing you do can stop them from biting you nothing we bought or used worked your just going to have to suffer them. they are quite big bites and really itchy i have come with scars whr i have scratched so much they scabbed not too nice but again not hotels fault really they did use some smoke stuff a few times i was there to try to kill them but there is so many because there are sooo many trees within the hotel that they will never ever get rid of them. Overall fantastic holiday i recommend this to anyone oh and by the way the entertainment is not great but is watchable dancing most nights but you feel like you are waiting forever for it to start. this is a brilllll holiday so defo choose this hotel !!!!!!! you will have a fab time.", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bay Area, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat vacation!\u201d", "Author": "pnklaci", "ReviewID": "UR77037222", "Content": "All I can say is this was a perfect vacation.

However, your room key is just that. A key on a huge plastic key chain!! Riu needs to upgrade to electronic passcards!! Carrying around a key that has your room number stamped on it is a huge inconvenience as well as a safety issue. In addition, our room safe, was a metal box bolted to the floor in the closet. The front desk provided us a lock that had another key to carry around, that fit a small square lock that consisted of 2 small \"prongs\" that would pop out on either side of the lock. Not the most secure feeling in the world when my passport is in there supposedly securely locked! There was lots of \"wiggle room\" as far as the lock fitting into the metal box. My girlfriend left her valuables locked in her luggage. So, if you don't want to carry keys around with you, go to the dollar store and buy a bungee wrist band and wear your keys all week. Room: weird setup for the bathroom. It is separated from the rest of the room by a curtain, not a door. Also, no bathtub, just a shower stall. There was an issue with our shower not draining but this was repaired for us right away once the front desk actually understood it was a drain issue, not a shower head issue! (They came and changed the showerhead originally) Hot water was plentiful, and there was good water pressure in the shower. Beds: yep, they're hard Beach: fantastic white sand! Great turquoise water! tons of deck chairs! Tons of topless Spanish women, so beware if you are travelling with your children. Signed up for the parasailing, and was told it would be 30 minutes in the air, and it was only 10! But still, it was a great experience!! Pool: not too bad, but get up early if you want a decent chair, as they get reserved very early. Very noisy with all the music, and activities. If you want quiet, go down to the beach. More chairs in the water would be great, as they were always taken too. Entertainment Staff: great group! Very friendly. Ivan, JC, Adrian, and Elvis are the best. Ivan took us into town one night to a club after my girlfriend and I complained there was no night life at the club. Elvis is nice on the eyes for sure, and is a very nice guy. Polite and respectful, and puts on a great show for pool aerobics! Patrons: being Canadian, and having travelled to a few all inclusives before, I was a little disappointed with this resort as far as nightlife. Most of the guests were either British, Spanish, French or Portuguese. Not much English being spoken, and had a few encounters with extremely rude people. Don't expect others to socialize with you very much at the bars in the evening. There were no other Canadians or Americans to be seen anywhere!!!! Also, many people travelled with their children. Definitely not a resort for single people!!! Go into town to the clubs at night if you want to go dancing. Great club called Mandala. $20 gets you into VIP and all drinks for free. Take advantage of the other RIU resorts down the street. Turn right from the end of the driveway and walk to the RIU Tequila or RIU Playacar and have breakfast there. They offer different items. Also, there is a Starbuck's just beside the RIU Tequila!!! Thank god for that! Gym: used the gym everyday. 2 Treadmills, 1 Elliptical, 1 Stepper, weights. Gotta work off all the great food! Food: Never disappointed with the food! Great buffet each day. Only tried the Steakhouse ala cart, and it was ok, but would have preferred the buffet!! Again, if you want to mix it up, walk to the other RIU properties and eat there! All in all was a nice resort. Vegetation was great, hot and humid. Saw the monkeys a few times, as well as iguanas. What would stop me from going back were the other guests!!!! Perhaps the patronage is different in spring break, but somehow I doubt it. Much preferred the RIU resort in Los Cabos I went to last year!!", "Date": "August 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "north london england", "Title": "\u201cHoliday of a life time for all the family / that want different things\u201d", "Author": "winterfamily2010", "ReviewID": "UR75176552", "Content": "traveling with me and my husband my 18 year old daughter and 14 year old son,when ever we go on holiday we always say( could of gone for 10 days not 14), on this holiday we could of stayed forever. i am not the sort of person to join in, just want to read my book, on my hols by the end of the first day played water polo,french bowls and joined in with water keep fit.

Firstly the mosquito and sand fly bites we got were unbelievable. This despite having an electric repellant plugged into a socket in our room and smearing our bodies with most repellants that you can buy. We spent most of the hoiliday scratching because these bites were bad. Everyone you saw had been bitten just as bad. We took the advice of a local working at the complex and smeared our arms and legs with Tequilla. This didn't work as the mosquitoes must have thought it was all inclusive for them too, feeding off our bodies and having a drink at the same time! We were not too happy either about the rats with wings that flew onto your table trying to eat you food of your plate. The staff made no effort to discourage this. This only happened at the Margarita and Beach Bar restaurants. Another thing that annoyed us was having to pay port taxes when we went onto a Pirate boat trip organised with the Thomsons rep.This discouraged us against any more sea trips. Our biggest bug bear was having to pay to get out of Mexico on the return flight. It costs not a Fiver or Ten pounds but actually \u00a338 per person to get out what a rip off! We were not happy about this but a family from Belfast with Two adults and two children aged 4yrs and 6 month respectively had to pay \u00a3152 to exit Mexico. I asked the tour rep why this was happening but she did not Know. This needs looking into because you pay enough for the Holiday without incurring these extra add ons. Enough of the negatives we did enjoy the holiday with the hotel located next to the beach and the lovely carribean weather.

Whilst we were there we visited all the other Rius and said that if we ever went back this was the one we would choose. Also as we took our teenage boys this would be better for them. The check-in was good and we were told which block our rooms were in and within a few minutes of getting there our luggage arrived. The room was clean and had all the things necessary. The beds were a bit hard the first night so the next day we ordered mattress toppers which were delivered within a couple of hours. The front desk rang nearly every day the first week to see if things were in order and if we had made a request to make sure that it had been done. We requested diet pepsi for the fridge and this was promptly delivered. The food is very good quality but can get a bit repetitive after 2 weeks, even if you take something different each day as they do not vary it at all. Most other AI\u2019s I have stayed at will change the menu every few days. The Chinese is good but still a buffet, the Mexican is a buffet and we were not keen on the food. The Steakhouse was good and had proper service. When I go to a restaurant I would like to be waited on otherwise I might just as well go to the buffet. The pool towel games are bad \u2013 if you were not up by 9 am you would not get a lounger at all \u2013 if you wanted a particular area you needed to have your towel out by 7 am! On the beach though there were lots of loungers but not a lot of shade. The beach is beautiful. They were trying to renovate the pool area whilst we were there and this really needed it. The paint was peeling and the lights were floating around in the pool. I also never saw them clean it and my husband got a really bad ear infection whilst there which after 2 different anti-biotics has not gone yet. Several other people we spoke to also had ear infections. The animation team are fantastic and really encouraged you to join in \u2013 if you did not want to then they left you alone the rest of the holiday. If you were willing then they would rope you into anything \u2013 we had great fun, shooting, waterpolo, football, playing bowls etc. The crazy games are very silly and can be anything from balloon bursting to flip flop flinging across the pool. Please be advised that it can get quite noisy around the pool with all the games and music and of course the bingo, you will not be sleeping! The evening shows are ok mainly dancing \u2013 our favourite was the circus show which was fantastic. The watersports people are not good at all \u2013 we had trouble booking the free things, non motorized sports. They seemed to only let people do things that cost extra. On one occasion we were told that ALL the pedlos were broken even though we had seen them out just before and when we asked to take a kayak out they did not want to let us \u2013 a Spanish speaking lady who arrived after us had no problem and when I asked the American speaking lad he said that it was because we were \u2018English\u2019! We had some days of heavy rain whilst we were there and they have no plans for anything if this happens everyone just sits around, again in other places I have been they will put some entertainment on in the lobby to keep people amused. Also they do not provide umbrellas in your rooms (other resorts I have been to do) and you have to ask at reception for them, which by the time you realize this are all gone as some people would have one each rather than one per room. With the very heavy rain which lasted 2 days at one time and the distance from the bars to the rooms you could get very wet without one. Overall this is a very nice resort, could do with a bit of renovation. The staff are excellent and will do anything to help. I would definitely go back especially if I have the teenagers as there was always something going on. If you are looking for a quiet relaxing vacation this is not the place. I was worried on reading some bad reviews before we went but it was not as bad as some are making out - not 5* by any means but we had a lovely time.", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood holiday but...\u201d", "Author": "CMPDGomes", "ReviewID": "UR72482313", "Content": "This review is about the hotel, so I wont comment on anything relating to the travel company. Sorry if it is a bit long, but I will try to be as honest as I can. The location is very nice and you only have to walk a minute or so from your bedroom to the sea. If you do prefer the sea, you will love it here. We had a waitress waiting on arrival, serving some nice cocktails (Daikiri fresa). Check in was quick, as on arrival you are given an envelope with the room key (one), map of the resort and sister resorts in the area and the lock for your room safe. You are advised by Ana to keep everything important on the safe - this also will avoid certain problems other guests have reported on other reviews and it is common sense (just because you're on holiday dont leave your brain behind!). You are also advised (by your rep) that if you have any problems to report to the reception and they will try to help you. As a previous guest reported, there is no one to show you to your room, but if you have eyes, there are signs pointing the room numbers and all you have to do is ask a member of staff and they will direct you, as they did we us. The reception is open to the elements, therefore you cannot expect air con. In fact, the only air con areas are the bedrooms and the hacienda restaurant. The resort is more like an aparthotel setup, as you open the outside door and walk into your bedroom. The decor of the common areas is very nice and all is all related to the hacienda feel, hence why the rooms might come across as a bit dated. The room was large and we had the usual towel animal on the bed, but after a few days they stopped. It did not bothered us, but my in-laws had one every day in their room and they have got quite a good collection after the 10 days stay. The bed consists of 2 double beds together. We had our daughter with us and she slept in a very confortable fold out bed. The mattresses are very comfortable. I should point out that the air con is very powerful and we had to turn it down quite often as the room became quite chilly. You do need it, as you can feel the heat blast when you open the bedroom door. The curtains and walls could do with a good clean as people tend to kill the mosquitoes and we could see some left over from previous guests. There is a drinks dispenser in the wall in the dressing area and a mini fridge. The fridge was refilled everyday, but the dispenser took more than the couple of days they say they do. We arrived on saturday and it was refilled on wednesday, probably because I left a glass on the dispenser shelf as a hint. The shower cubicle (no bath - and no, you dont need one!) is good sized and can probably fit two, although I havn't tried. There was a bit of mould in some areas, due to the humidity, but what can you do? some days we had 100% humidity and there is no window in the toilet area. My room was tidied up every day and clean towels were left. The pool is not as big as it looks in the pictures and most reviews are right - the paint is peeling, making it somewhat \"dirty\" at the bottom. The pool closes at 8pm to be cleaned, but I guess they just add chlorine to the water, as I didn't see any cleaning taking place. There was always someone early morning with the nets and they would return during the day if needed. You can get towels from (i think) 8am to 5:30pm and I would suggest if you like to stay in the shadow by the pool, to get your towels and mark your chair before heading out for breakfast. This is not recommended by the resort, but what can you do if everyone else is doing the same? The largest and easy access pool is where the water polo, scuba lesson and aerobics take place in the morning, so this is somewhat annoying - maybe they could use the smaller pool? The guy at Cozumel pool bar is very friendly and we had a good time trying the drinks menu and his sugestions while in the water. The Tulum pool bar is always packed and we only managed to get in on the first few days of holiday (10 - 12 Jul) when it was quieter. I avoided the cold water jacuzzi, as it was soo dirty it had foam on it. I actually saw a member of staff scooping up the foam with his hands and throwing it on the pavement, expecting people to go in. I can't comment on the entertainment, because it is not my cup of tea and I did not see much of it. My daughter stayed for the Michael Jackson and she enjoed it. My in-laws liked the mayan ceremony and the Mamma mia. The beach is great. It is raked early every morning and the loungers are put out for you. There arent that many shadows, but you will have a great time nonetheless. Shadows are better to the right of the pool area, near the watersports. The water is very warm. Take care when going into the water, as it is very unlevel and there might be some small rocks. I got a nice cut on my foot because of that. We tried the watersports on offer - were refused the catamaran because you need to know how to manouver it (they do offer lessons if you are willing to pay) and the pedal boat because there was a strong current... Managed to use the kayak another day and paid around $700 pesos to have a go at the jet ski. Regarding the food, there is a good variety and unless you expect gourmet cuisine, you will have something to eat. The Hacienda restaurant offered any type of breakfast you can think of - nice made in the minute fruit juices, (stale) variety of cereals, waffles, hot cocoa milk, yogurt, continental and full british and my favourity - donas (cheese and ham toast). For lunch and dinner you also have a selection of dishes with pizzas, pastas, salads, fish, chicken and any other on offer. I recommend the white fish. The hacienda closes at 3 after lunch and at 10pm after dinner. If you want to go \"a la carte\" you have to book it during breakfast at the Hacienda. They usually offer you a couple of times - 6: 45 and 8:45pm depending on the demand. If Roger is booking, don't bother asking for a later time. He is useless and doesn't care what you want, even if you're the customer, you have to keep to whatever he wants. I once booked the margarita for the evening and he told me straight away 6:45. I asked if I could have a later booking and although he already had names for 8:45 he said no. Later on I came to him again and queued up after a couple who was also booking the same restaurant and he gave them the 8:45 slot! I just gave the ticket back to him. The other girl in charge of the bookings is much more approachable and will book you at the time you want. The margarita restaurant opens at around 10:30 -11? and offers a good range of what they call snacks but ends rolling up to lunch with almost the same selection as its offered in the hacienda. You can also just wrap your towel around you and walk in to have a bite, which you wont be able to do at the hacienda. In the evening it becomes the steak house. They give you a ceaser salad (four leaves of lettuce) and plate of veggie fritters for two and a bicolour soup which is very nice. The only a la carte choice you have is the main course, where you have a choice of steaks (ribeye and sirloin), chicken and what they call sea and mountain. The steaks are very tender. The Asian is not a la carte. It is a buffet of entrees including sushi with cream cheese (weird), salads, miso. The mains are at the end of the restaurant and they usually have sweet and sour pork, lemon chicken and a duck dish. Deserts include lichees, some asian sweets and fried ice cream on request. The Mexican is also a la carte for the main meal. You have a buffet of salads and entrees and you can also help yourself to the tortilla soup which is nice with a dash of lime juice. We only went to this one once. What is good about all the meals is that there is always someone serving you drinks, from coffee and milk at breakfast to wine at luch/dinner and they keep reffilling your water glass. Josue is a very nice waiter at the Hacienda and I would recommend you try to get in his area. Nachos with cheese are offered in mid morning near the Tulum pool bar and you can help yourself. We also had a day when fresh coconut was being served with and without alcohol. They were gone within 5 minutes and were not enough for everyone. The majority of staff is very friendly and we spoke spanish to everyone (we're portuguese, so that isn't so hard) until we came across a cocky waiter and decided we weren't being treated as other english speaking guests, so we started speaking english to everyone (apart from the nice staff we already knew). I guess they expect bigger tips if you speak english and treat you better. The grounds are well kept and we could see some wildlife around, but no monkeys. The majority of the wildlife is mosquitoes. Man, they are annoying! You can try anything, they will bite you nonetheless. I had a plug in replent diffuser and took on the advice of other reviewers and used vodka on the first few days and managed to go bite free, but I think they started to enjoy the booze and really started coming around. I had to change strategy and moved on to jungle formula. Shouldn't have bothered packing it. Next I tried Off, a local repellent, but at this stage I was already so bitten that I dont know to what extent it worked, but I did see a few new ones. This is probably what will put me off going back to the same area of Mexico, but I enjoyed the time there anyway. Overall, I will have to agree with the remainder of the reviewers and say because of the maintenance issues with the pools, jacuzzi and room this resort deserves the 3 stars, but because of staff friendliness and the beach, I will give it 4 stars.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sheffield", "Title": "\u201cdon't listen to these rubbish reviews, they are a load of crap\u201d", "Author": "megand1992", "ReviewID": "UR72400485", "Content": "I went with my mum dad, boyfriend, sister and her boyfriend and thought it was fantastic. best place i have ever been. before we went we read thes reviews on this website and various others and there was people sayin it isnt worth it, not a 4+ and was really put out by all the rubbish reviews. but when we got there it was amazing, very clean and there was lots of entertainment throughout the day and night. theres something for every one like sitting on your bum all day, playing activities, sports, kids club...brilliant. the entertainment team were fantastic aswell.

The staff offer great service and we never wanted for anything. Check in was quick and we were given a larger room as we were getting married which was very clean, spacious and cool. A few people on here said the beds were hard but we found them very comfortable. The hotel grounds have lots of wildlife - even monkeys! Everyone is very friendly, especially the animation team who were fantastic! There was always lots to do throughout the day, including watersports on the beach. There was plenty of food to choose from, you could have something different every day and the steak house was really nice. Beach and Pool were both lovely, although one pool could get rather dirty which did put me off going in there at times!! We went on a day trip to Excaret which I would recommend, there is so much to see and do there and we had a great day! We also went into town at night and went to Coco Bongo - it is an amazing club and defintley worth going too! It is quite expensive to get in but all drinks are included! There are also some really nice bars down by the beach near Coco Bongo. Overall we had an amazing holiday and want to go back already!! If you are thinking about getting married here then I would recommend it as everything went perfectly. There was no hassle, they sorted everything and it was exactly how we wanted it. The only down side is that it is hot but the ceremony is over very quickly and we did not find it too bad - we went straight in the pool after!! We got married on the beach and there are alot of people watching on the sun beds around where you get married but you really do not notice!! I was really worried about it but it was not a problem at all. I got my hair and nails done at the spa at the hotel and both looked really nice - the spa staff are very helpful!

The hotel is ok but is much closer to a 3 star hotel than the claimed 5 star resort. The restaurants in the hotel (of which there are 4) were all disappointing. The 'themed' restaurants - Steakhouse, Mexican and Asian all keep to the same menu so you have little variety once you have been. The main buffet restaurant is ok for the 1st couple of days but as time goes on you notice the same menu's day after day and you get sick of it (and it's blandness) very quickly. The hotel itself is very open with no air conditioning (except in your room which has a temperature akin to Siberia) so when it gets hot (and it does get hot!) you have no alternative but to get on with it and the humidity that accompanies the heat can be stifling at times. The whole holiday had a sense of groundhog day to it with every day blending in to each other. If your objective is to do absolutely nothing but sunbathe and drink then I guess the Riu Yucatan could be for you but the repetativeness of the daily boredom drove me and my family mad. The resort of Playacar is not really a resort more a series of hotels along the beachfront so unless you share the facilities of Riu's sister hotels (which are all pretty much the same) then you are a prisoner. The resort of Playa Del Carmen which is a short taxi ride away thinks it is a Spain and is full of shops that sell tat with sellers that constantly try to hassle you into their shops - to see more tat ! This means your only escape is to book trips to see the Mayan ruins or travel further afield. The Mayan ruins are definately worth seeing. The trips we booked at the hotel (through Thompson) were very expensive and meant extensive (unadvised) amounts of time on a coach !!! but they did offer a welcome escape from the dumbed down entertainment being served up in the hotel. Speaking of the entertainment it drove me mad - imagine the Chuckle Brothers crossed with Timmy Mallet and you are getting somewhere close to the nauseating monologues constantly bombarding your senses whilst you try to relax. The night time entertainment served up was no better with amateurish mini (kids)disco's, 1970's MOR instrumentals and the hotels grand 'evening shows' which were again amateurish and repetative. A truely painful experience only equalled by the constant presence of a million mosquito's feasting on any available flesh present. The mosquito's were a constant pain wherever you travelled in the area. No escape from the little blighters anywhere and no amount of repellent (from any make) seemed to deter them. My final comment would be about the clientele of the hotel. With Mexico becoming more popular it is fast becoming another Spain !! The all inclusive nature of the hotel means that the bars are open 24 hours a day which encourages some people to take advantage a little to much. Too much tequilla (or whatever they drink all day) means that the banter and language can become loud and juvenile very quickly and can last until well into the night. In summary - I wouldn't go to Mexico again, I would never go all inclusive again, I would never book through Thompsons again and I wouldn't stay at a Riu hotel again. Says it all really. PS - The coffee the hotel serves up MUST be the WORST coffee in the world so take your own !", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "staffordshire", "Title": "\u201cBest Holiday ever xxxxx\u201d", "Author": "shazerh", "ReviewID": "UR70072482", "Content": "Got back from the riu yucatan 2 weeks ago with my partner and 11 year old daughter.

CHECK-IN Brilliant \u2013 everything we needed was waiting for us in an envelope and the receptionist even mapped out the quickest way to your room. Cases were taken to our room for us (thankfully \u2013 we were on the 3rd floor with no lift) pretty quickly. ROOM This was absolutely fine. You have to bear in mind this is a Caribbean 4 star, not a UK / American 4 star. Think along the lines of Premier Inn standards and you'll be about right. We were in the 2000 block (nearest the main building) up on the 3rd floor - no lift, but you do need to get some exercise on this sort of holiday! We had 2 double beds pushed together which wasn't ideal, but not really an issue. There wasn't any beer in the fridge on the day we arrived, but this was sorted out quickly. The room was kept spotless the whole time we were there, beds were changed every day and towels were replaced whether you left them in the shower to be replaced or not. Slightly strange that the clean bath towels were put on a shelf in the toilet ... Yes, the room only has a shower, but its a large shower and there is plenty of hot water whenever you want it. Mini bar was kept topped up every 2 days as promised. One down side is that as the whole floor is tiled, be VERY careful once you have sprayed your sunscreen / aftersun / mosquito repellent as it makes the floor very slippery. We didn't find the beds hard at all - in fact we slept better there than we did at home! Oh yes - the room comes fully equipped with a decent hairdryer and a full size iron and ironing board, so don't bother taking anything like that along. FOOD The food was fine. We got the impression that they were catering very much for the northern European palate rather than anything else as it was very much meat, a bit of fish, pasta, salad and potatoes. The last Riu we went to in Mexico seemed to have a better range, but saying that there was nothing wrong with the food served here. There was plenty of it, and everything I had was very nice. There was always a Mexican selection, but my hubby felt it was a bit basic. The pasta station was very good though - nice to see it all cooked from scratch in front of you. We tried both the Chinese and the steak house a la cartes - very impressed with both. Contrary to other reviews, the steak house is fully a la carte. Make sure you are hungry when you go - you get a Ceasar salad, some fried veg & chicken wings, soup, main course and dessert. You have a choice of mains and I never managed to finish a whole meal. The Chinese is actually a mix of Oriental cuisine - some very good sushi along with other Chinese favourites. This is a buffet, but as there are limited numbers then it doesn't feel like the normal scrum. And yes, you do have to get up early to book, but we got in the habit of getting up early to get sunbeds (hey - if you can't beat them, join them) and then going straight to book the restaurant before going back to bed for half an hour. Never had a problem with availability. And I can honestly say that neither of us suffered any adverse reaction to any of the food at any time. All the stomach medication we took with us came home with us. POOL Okay, this is where it gets a bit dodgy. The pools themselves seemed perfectly clean (guys walking round 4 - 5 times a day scooping leaves, etc out) and were VERY warm. However the pool surrounds were in need of some TLC. The paint around the pool edge was flaking badly and stuck to you, and the sun bed areas could do with a damn good sweep every day. Loads of cigarette butts everywhere which aren't pleasant when they get stuck to your feet. Lots of shades available, but you did have to get up early to get a bed that would guarantee you sun and shade. Hubby was getting up just before 0700 every day to get our beds. Slightly annoying when you saw beds with towels that were left unoccupied all day, but that didn't happen too often. HOWEVER, the pool bar nearest the beach was DISGUSTING! Rather than being a bar at the end of the pool like the one in the back pool, this was a separate pool area with tables, seats, etc that you could sit at. Without wishing to go into too much detail, we watched large groups of young people sitting in the water at this bar for 6 hours plus, drinking heavily, without ever leaving the pool ........ We went to go in it at one point and on closer inspection I refused to get in the water. We decided it was much safer to get the beer from one of the other bars and stay in the main pool. BARS You won't ever go thirsty here! The lobby bar is open almost 24 hrs, the pool bars open at 1030, and the theatre bars stay open until midnight (or later I think). The bar staff were great - we ended up going to the Tequila most nights and it got to the point that by the time we were halfway through our drinks they were making us a fresh one. Pretty good cocktail menu, but we stayed with magaritas and mojitos most of the time. If you want branded spirits, make sure you ask for them by name (we ordered Gordons & tonic rather than just asking for gin). If you don't like strong drinks, make sure you ask for a small one as they are very generous measures! If you are brave, try a flaming Mexican flag! The beer on the resort was okay - not a patch on Corona - but it was cold and wet which was very welcome after a long day at the pool. If you wanted a soft drink by the pool before the bars opened, they have self-service dispensers for fruit juices and sodas with plenty of ice available. ENTERTAINMENT The entertainment staff were some of the hardest working people I have ever met. They started with games at around 1000 and finished when the shows finished just before midnight. If you didn't want to join in they didn't hassle you, but made a point of getting to know you if you did. The water polo and aqua aerobics seemed very popular every day. In the evenings, before the shows, there was a band playing and the staff would get people up dancing before doing some games on the stage. The shows were pretty good compared to what I've seen before and they are only repeated once per fortnight so you shouldn't see anything twice (unless you are lucky enough to go for more than 2 weeks). The nearest I can think of is think of Dirty Dancing and its something along the lines of that sort of level of entertainment. BEACH This is the star of this holiday! If you think the photos in the brochure are touched up, they aren't! The sea really is that colour and the sand really is that white. The sea can be a bit rough (1 day out of our whole holiday was a bit iffy) but most of the time it is just clear and warm. Not huge amounts of snorkelling to do but there were fish around most afternoons. The sand never gets hot either. Its possible to walk up and down the beach for miles. Probably the best beach I have ever seen. Loads of sunbeds, but not a lot of shade if that's what you are after. But totally stunning! WEATHER We had 1 iffy day which stayed cloudy following a heavy rain shower just before lunch, but apart from 1 other shower it was hot and sunny for the whole holiday. MISCELLANEOUS The reception staff were fantastic. I had problems with an excursion I had pre-booked from the UK (they forgot to pick us up) and the reception staff made numerous phone calls for us to get it sorted, and didn't charge us for any of them (its $1 a minute from your room!). Perfect customer service! Dress code \u2013 as far as we could make out, the only rules were that tops had to worn in the restaurants at all times and the men had to wear tops with sleeves in the restaurants in the evenings, but it appeared that long shorts were okay in the a la cartes as opposed to long trousers, but most people seemed to make a bit of an effort for these which was nice. Don\u2019t worry too much about the howler monkeys (unless you are very lucky). We only saw 2 monkeys the whole time we were there (draped across the railings on a balcony one morning) but I didn\u2019t hear anyone complain about the noise from them. We certainly never heard them. Plenty of wildlife roaming around the grounds, but they don\u2019t come too close. Unless you really can\u2019t be bothered walking, I would advise using the shops at Playacar Plaza rather than the ones on the resort. It\u2019s only a 5 minute walk and its much cheaper. Trips: we did Chichinitsa and Xel-ha. Both were fantastic and I\u2019ll review them separately. WARNING If you suffer from bad reactions to mosquito bites DO NOT GO HERE! We used loads of repellent and still suffered badly. If you go get bitten (and I can more or less guarantee that you will), go to the pharmacy and get some Caladryl \u2013 works brilliantly! We were bitten so badly it has kind of put me off going back. The grounds are fumigated every evening, but they can get them all. We had a plug-in in the room and the rep advised us to leave the fan on full as well as the air conditioning during the day as the bugs don\u2019t like the cold. We didn\u2019t have any in the room at all. Note:- it was cheaper to buy the mossie plug-in in Boots at Manchester Airport than from Amazon, etc. A tip is to rub neat vodka or tequila from your room into your skin before going out - hubby tried it a couple of times and it seemed to work. SUMMARY A really good holiday, with just a few downsides. Don\u2019t regret going at all, but the mossies would probably put me off going back. If someone invents 100% effective mossie repellent, I\u2019d be back like a shot (but would make more use of the a la carte restaurants for food variety).", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norfolk, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place\u201d", "Author": "kezzabird", "ReviewID": "UR68501467", "Content": "We stayed at the Yucatan from the 6th of June till the 20th and what can I say. The hotel is lovely, the staff are all friendly and the rooms although basic are good, with a free mini bar, and I mean, Vodka, Gin, Tequilla and something else we think it was dark rum or something like that. The fridge is filled every other day with soft drinks, beer and water. Great. Room always cleaned perfectly each day. The pool, you need to be around it by 7am each morning if you want a perticular spot. The one downfall was, the pool was filthy by 10am. The filters was not good enough, and you end up swimming in I dread to think what!! Also it seems there are no pool attendants, as what we saw some kids doing in that pool, wouldnt of been allowed anywhere else we have been. The food, was always lovely, if not a little repetitive, but totally edible. We did the Asian, Steak House and Mexican resturants, and enjoyed them, but the main buffet was probably the best. The beef joint and Lamb joint in main buffet was fantastic. The Hotel itself has mainly Spanish staying there. They are extremely rude and we were told not liked too much by the Mexicans. The police were called one day while we were there to take some spanish away for being aggressive towards other guests and staff! If you want something just ask the hotel are always willing to help out!! 5th Ave, we popped down there thinking it was going to be a secure area, but it wasnt our cup of tea. Within 5 mins of beginning the long walk down the ave we were offered every drug under the sun, by some very unsavoury characters. Taxis are everywhere, just make sure you ask the price before you get in. Silver is extremely expensive out there, so unless you feel really flush dont bother, especially as they have a habit of spraying tin and claiming its silver!! Bring TONNES of replellent, as the mosquitos are AWFUL. My husband who NEVER gets bit, got 21 bits on one ankle along withing the first 2 days. We were both eaten alive in the first week and we werent the only ones. Its because you are in the jungle. Ask Felix on reception for a mosquito burner to take to your room, its like incense and dosent smell great but it helps to get a rest from the mossies!! The wildlife around hotel is great didnt see the monkeys thought, the hotel apparnatly scared them away, cause they were causing probs with the guests. The beach is fantastic and the sea is beautiful and warm!! But if you want shade dont go to the beach as there is none. Met some fantastic people out there hi to Rob and Tracey from Douglas, North Carolina, hope you are both well!! Did the trips to Chitchen and Tulum, fantastic places, but boy was it hot. Nearly fainted with the heat. Talking on the heat, this place in June was in the 30's and extremely humid. I never break a sweat, but I couldnt stop dripping out here, it never cools down, even at night. The only place for a break from the heat is either your room, or the main buffet resturant which is air con'd. Really fantastic stay, totally enjoyed it and will go back one day. One last thing, we did the Captin Hook trip, and if you love a laugh and a total novel experience go, because its totally fantastic, such a great laugh, food is fantastic, and the drinks come all night. Aim to get on the middle deck by the bar, and they rope it off for you to have private area. If you sit down on deck you will be part of the entertainment. Fab trip recommend it to everyone.

Before we start our review we should point out that this is an honest and fair reflection of the hotel and resort, bearing in mind our friends have stayed at a RIU hotel before. What you are about to read is facts and what we were exposed to, no false statements. The hotel at first sight when you arrive gives you the impression of a super and awesome appearance. The hotel was built in 1997 and has had very little no refurbishment. We were met at the lobby by a member of staff and given a \"collective briefing\" and promptly directed to our rooms - no personal attention here! We stayed in room 3306 of which was to a reasonable standard but nothing to write home about. It was clean and cleaned every day with our mini bar stocked up frequently. This block was half way between pool/beach area and main building. Food & Dining: In short, the food in the main \"Hacienda\" restaurant was very disappointing and at times cold, in short supply and not the standard expected of a \"premier\" hotel with an acclaimed 5 star rating. Table setting was ad-hoc and the waiters often walked passed without even offering water unless you asked. The Margarita and Beach Club restaurants provide lunch afternoon snacks of which is the same food everyday! We recommend you avoid the Beach Club unless that is you like cold burgers. Both these restaurant areas double up to cater for the alleged and we quoute from brochure, \"a la carte restaurants\". THESE ARE NOT \"A LA CARTE\" but a mere \"themed\" offering. This was very disappointing as our ladies decided to take nice evening wear for the occasions and were bitterly disappointed with the standard. Suffice is to say, we ate only once in the steakhouse and asian buffet (albeit the asian was best and quite good). The toilet areas at the Beach Club and entertainment area were terrible, toilets continously blocked, no soap to wash hands and hand driers never worked. Not very hygeinic for a restaurant area. Pool area: Quite frankly, the pool water was disgusting with scum sitting on the top! The bar areas were also dirty. The pool area and beds were never cleaned, a quick sweep over and that was it. Enough said... Entertainment: Absolute joke, apart from the resident band that is, who were very good. Daytime entertainment team did a good job and were a laugh. Beach: Nice enough beach but don't expect to snorkel or use a kayak. During our 14 night stay we only used a kayak once and that was from the Playacar hotel as our beach club claimed the water was too rough (at times it was!). Very disappointed. Drinks: Its the bar staff that makes this place. Benito, Eduardo and Carlos were very friendly and helpful. The cocktails were good especially the tequilla boom booms! Its a shame the hotel couldn't raise its standards to that of the bar staff... In summary, it would appear that this hotel has opted for quantity rather than quality and if they wish to retain retunring guests then they must improve.", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Torpoint, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot what it's made out to be!!\u201d", "Author": "mirob6", "ReviewID": "UR65360572", "Content": "We have just returned from 2 weeks staying at the RIU Yucatan. Unfortunately it was not the holiday we thought it would be. Firstly the hotel was built in 1997 and by the condition of the rooms they have not been updated since, everything has seen better days. We travelled to Mexico to try to avoid the typical British behaviour abroad. Unfortunately this hotel catered to their needs by having drinking games around the pool which ended up in a lot of drunk people causing havoc. It was more like an expensive holiday to Benidorm! The hotel also has a policy on all persons not reserving sunbeds, however unless you put your towel on a bed by 06.00hrs you had no chance of sitting there. The policy said if they found towels on beds they would be removed, they were not up held though so this continued throughout the holiday. We ended up sitting on the beach to get away from the hassle. The only problem there was that there were no umbrella's and you had to try to get some shade by following the shade of a palm tree if you were lucky enough to find a bed near one! The policy also said no lilo's in the pool, needless to say this was not up held either. We also had issue's with noisy neighbours we advised the hotel and reps and we were told that the people would be spoken too, nothing changed though so we ended uo resorting to using ear plugs to get some peace. The only positive thing we can say is that the hotel waiters, cleaners were very polite, mannerly and helpful. The cleaners always had a smile and the rooms were cleaned daily. This is not a holiday we would want to repeat especially as I came home with a viral infection and have been ill ever since :-(", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Epsom, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGodd Times, Happy Days we will be back\u201d", "Author": "whiteytowers52", "ReviewID": "UR65359467", "Content": ". For the money this hotel is brilliant. the beach is wonderful and they are despereately trying to maintain it, the food is brilliant and there is always a good choice of food which can sometimes be overwhelming and you end up with quite a mixture. The staff try desperately hard to look after you and no matter what time of day there is always a member of staff cleaning something. The entertainment team are great, the shows ok are not Westend but for the budget that they are given and the effort that they put in 10/10 and they are quite entertaining you also have the option of the Tequila over the road. They have changed the activities in the daytime but but I think that was more due to staff being on holiday.Holidays are what you make them and we have found that this hotel is one of the friendliest hotels that we have ever stayed in and you cannot avoid meeting new people and making new friends . On previous reviews I notice that there has been comments about the towels being threadbare and from my experience they are slowly replacing them. Ok lets go over the negatives yes some of the rooms could do with an update but if you ask they will happily move you, yes there are mosquitos its a tropical country what more can you expect and yes you have to get up early if you want a bed round the pool happens everywhere and don't think it will ever change, Having been to this hotel before it isn't as good as standard as the first time we went 9 years ago but compared to our visit 2 years ago it has improved greatly. My only other ask would be if there could be more food available late at night, I know its AI and surely you should have enough during the day but when you have been out late sometimes you get the munchies and the Tequila is a bit of a trek. The only other thing that I can make a negative comment on is that other nationalities who come in groups tend to have no care for others and are rowdy, dirty and sometimes intimidating even when asked to quieten down. The area is fantastic, Playa Del Carmen has everything that you need and is well worth a visit and if you want a mad night CocoBongos is the place to go, The Blue Parrot is also good if you have more of a budget or want a 2nd night out. All in all love it love it love it and will be returning My only ? where have all of the iguanas gone used to be lots but they seen to have vanished. Trips Xel Ha great for snorkelling we went under our own steam which was better than taking the tour co as we could come & go as we pleased so no pressure and if you share a taxi with others it keepsthe cost down.

Check-in at the hotel is speedy without the usual fight to the front of reception or having to leave your passport overnight. Have a few pesos or dollars handy straight away to tip the porters who bring your luggage to your room, we were a bit taken back as they literally stood over us whilst we rummaged to the bottom of our bags for currency. FOOD \u2013 Excellent! Great choice and totally delicious. Breakfast is awesome and most evenings are themed. The steak house is a nice change if you fancy waiter service and if you want a romantic meal overlooking the beach book into the Mexican. Lunch is easiest by the pool but there is a greater choice and its much cooler in the main restaurant during the day. Seriously, if you can\u2019t find something you like to eat here you are a fussy eater! DRINKS \u2013 Great! The only down side is the small perspex cups used around the pool. They are fine for shorts / cocktails but for soft drinks and beer, pour your own from the self service areas using the polystyrene cups. They are alot bigger and keep you\u2019re your drinks much cooler. ROOMS \u2013 Spot on! Rooms are very spacious with good aircon, powerful hairdryer, mini bar re-stocked every 2 days, free safety deposit and plenty of hanging space. OK, they\u2019re not 5 star but immaculately clean and have everything you need. FACILITIES \u2013 Good. The pool area is busy with lots of atmosphere around the pool bars. There were lots of organised activities but no pressure to join in. If you want to seek shade you\u2019ll need to be quick to grab a lounger as these are the first to go. The beach is beautiful with an abundance of loungers any time of day. Clean beach towels every day are a bonus. ENTERTAINMENT \u2013 Don\u2019t hold your breath! The shows are just your average hotel evening entertainment but the live band are pretty amusing. Nothing much happens from 11pm. Night owls can head into Playa Del Carmen but we didn\u2019t venture out on a night. The staff are extremely helpful and hardworking. It\u2019s worth the 10 minute walk down the beach to the Riu Playacar for a change of scenery if you\u2019re the type of person that gets all-inclusive cabin fever. The pool area is much quieter and the grounds are very pretty. The complex is excellent value with the option to eat and drink at the Lupita, Tequila or Playacar hotels too. The hotel is showing signs of its age around the edges so with this in mind I think 4 star is a more accurate rating.

Let me preface this by saying that we have traveled to alot of all inclusives throughout the caribbean in the past 12 years or so. You have to appreciate each county for it's customs and differences. I had read many great reviews about the hotel but a couple of months before we were to leave I read horrible reviews about the beach construction. I'm thrilled to report that all of the reconstruction was complete by the time we went! Although the hotel was in need of room renovations, overall it was wonderful. The staff works so hard and are so pleasant to deal with. Honestly the only thing that we were not 100% satisfied with was the room. We booked a king size bed room only to find that 2 double beds were pushed together to make a king. The beds were very hard but after a full day in the sun and partying into the night, any bed was appreciated. The shower drain did not drain in any of our rooms and their was a sewage smell that seemed to go away and come back (building with rooms in the 5's) There really should be updating but everything was still very clean. The food at all restaurants was fantastic as were the wait staff. The bartenders were all so busy but all so pleasant. The only thing dissapointing to one of our co-travelers was that the resort did not carry Corona. Dos Equis was the preferred beer at the hotels. We went into Playa DelCarmen to get some Corona and do some shopping. The quality of the alcohol was the same in any all inclusive (other than a 5 star) . Domestic beverages but cocktails were made very well by most bartenders. With great weather, lots of good food, ok drinks and great company, we had a wonderful time! Don't be alarmed by the screaming of the Howler monkies in the resort. They awake early and create a ruckus. They're harmless as are the little animals running around that are the equivalent of a squirel. We were the minority as non-smokers. Mostly French and UK tourists in this resort. Great to meet new people and just have fun. Priveleges at the other resorts in the gated Resort Community were only a short walk away, very safe and all very nice. Pretty much the same stuff at all the sister resorts. One tip on shopping. You will get ripped off if you don't know the exchange rate as it seemed some of the prices in pesos were jacked up to make up the loss in the exchange rate with the US dollar. That said, be sensible. ask questions before you buy. Most cell phones have a currency converter built in. That was very helpful.

We had stayed at several Riu hotels previously so knew not to expect a lot when it comes to the rooms. The hotel itself is lovely. Great pool area and an amazing beach.

The standard rooms are very basic and I would definitely recommend upgrading to the suites as the standard rooms are very small and the bathroom is kind of strange the way the have the very small shower situtated. The suites were excellent we had a huge balcony and the howler monkeys hung out just outside our room every morning which was lots of fun taking videos and pictures. There was also lots of other wildlife at this hotel just walking around which was great as well. The food at the buffet was good for the most part but as per usual with an all inclusive byt he end of the week it gets reptitious. The lunch buffet could definitely use some more options as it is only in the snack bar area so you only have the one choice everyday and it does not change much throughout the week. This being said we did not bother with the a la carte restaurants as we don't like to have to get up early to make reservations and to be on a schedule as far as meals. Some people said they were good but we were happy for the most part just eating in the buffet. The entertainment staff was great...always something happening. They take a break for about two hours in the mid afternoon between 1-3pm it seemed so it was a bit quieter around the pool at that time but at any other time they were around to amuse us. Especially Elvis and Lester great guys. I would recommend this to anyone that is not looking for something over the top but is looking for a fun loving hotel with good to average food. Great location as it is only a $5.00 taxi ride to Playa del Carmen or about a 30 minute walk. There is great shopping just down the street as well across from the Riu Playacar at the Plaza Playacar lots of shops and no one pesters you like they do in Playa and the prices were even better than what we got in Playa sometimes so definitely worth checking it out...only about a ten minute walk from the Yucatan. Just one warning to bring anything you may need as far as medical supplies such as polysporin with you as the pharmacy close to the hotel wanted to charge us $25.00 USD for a small tube of it....if you went into Playa it was much cheaper but by the time you paid taxis etc it was not worth the trip.

The resort is located about 2 miles from playa del carmen, within a gated community of other resorts and private homes. The Yucatan staff greeted us and provided us with early check in. We wanted to be close to the pool area and were placed accordingly in bldg 5. We also wanted a 3rd floor room, as we were told most had actual king size beds, not 2 doubles pushed together. The room was spotless and had our king bed. We worried about the hardness of the beds from previous posts, but found the beds to be fine. We had a partial view of the ocean from our balcony and from our door area. We were never in the room, so the view was only nice as we left for day. The pools are fairly large with 2 swim up bars. The swim up near the ocean gets real busy and is isolated from the main pool, so the water gets really warm and somewaht cloudy. The cozumel swim up is less crowded but your in the main pool so the water seems nicer. The beach is really nice. They have planted alot of new palms that will be great cover as soon as they grow in. You can still find cover amoung some of the old growth, and the pool seating area that overlooks the beach. There are 2 bars within the pool area that work well to escape the sun, or to watch the nighly shows in the theater pavillion. A small bar setup near the beach entrance serves the beach goers well. There is also a bar in the reception area that is always open. We are very fond of the bar scene and were not disapointed at all. The bar staff as well as the entire Yucatan staff must all sleep very well. These guys are ALWAYS running aound like nuts. They mix drinks and pour beer non stop. The grounds crew is always sweeping, picking up branches, or wiping surfaces down. And all with a smile and a friendly Hola. The buffets were all very nicely done as well. They have simple pizza and burgers, or fish, pork chops etc. breakfast is great, lots of fruit, eggs, french toast panckes cereal. You will not go hungry here. Walking the beach to Playa is an easy walk. the sand is not overly hot and if you go after a rain, the sand is firm with easy footing. Playa has tons of shops and bars. lots of policia and some mexican army keeping tabs on things. You feel completely safe day or night. We walked every day, just to digest after a massive breakfast. You can walk the road back to the resort or take a cab as well. 5 bucks and 5 mins. You can do as much or as little as you want. Aside from a few days of heavy rain, it was a great trip. By all means do not hesitate to book here. Not 5 star, but solid 4. I will be back to a Riu again.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cA Great Holiday\u201d", "Author": "Couples3", "ReviewID": "UR61935882", "Content": "I traveled with my family and I loved this resort because it had great food, really cool pools, fantastic beach, I thought all the animals around the resort was so cool.

The air conditioning in the room made noise, but made no appreciable difference in the climate. Stained, threadbare sheets. Towels that must be original to the property. The most uncomfortable hotel bed I've ever encountered. Lockbox had so many layers of paint, we had to engineer a system to pry it open with each use.

We ask three times before we got one. Only went one night without it. The water pressure is poor in the shower. The service and staff are absolutely wonderful. The food was fabulous.

The drinks were nothing to be excited about, they all tasted the same just different colors, but the bartenders were great. The beach was nice, clean with a lot of chairs. The entertainment SUCKED! The pool music was Elvis for three consecutive hours, later Bon Jovi, it just seemed like the CD was playing until the music ran out and replaced with another boring one. The music was not mixed and when we asked if they could play some Latin music or club music, they said they don\u2019t do that. The night show was way below my expectation. It looked like bunch of cute girls and muscled guys got on the stage to dance at their own pace and so not in sync. It almost looked like they were auditioning. The entertainers (some of the guys) were very unprofessional with the guests. One day the girls and I had to leave the pool area, because the staff was acting silly and one of them was under alcohol influence, not joking, he asked me to get him a drink. We were told that the beach towels were not available for 25min and after waiting for over hour and a half we finally got them. Yes, we couldn't get hold of the front desk when we need it, but our room was always clean with fresh towels and restocked mini bar, however the beds were so hard, we felt like we were sleeping on the floor.

That water color is incredible! There was never a shortage of beach chairs. They had a lot of kayaks and paddle boats that were included in the price, but only 2 kayaks were usable and only 2 paddle boats were usable. The others were all broken! The food at the buffet was always plentiful and good. The restaurants? I really wouldn't even bother next time. The Asian restaurant was just a buffet and not anything better than the regular buffet. The steak house was okay. They turn the outdoor lunch buffet into the steak restaurant at night. The rooms were definitely in need of some fixing up. Most of the drawers to our dressers were broken. The beds were hard, but with a pillow top - not too bad. The rooms definitely had the feel of a lower budget hotel. Nothing special. But, they were clean - which to me is most important!

The reception area is awesome and includes a bar and lounge area, a couple of shops and the main buffet retaurant leading off it, with outside dining if you prefer. The buffet retaurant was excellent with a variety of foods to experiment with if you are unsure of the unknown! The breakfasts were wonderful with fresh juice or smoothies available. Omlettes were cooked while you waited with whatever filling you wanted. You could also have champagne or bucks fizz, very nice. The waiting staff were very attentive. The rooms are spacious with twin beds pushed together, a lot of people seem to think they were very hard but this was not a problem we encountered. The maid in our room did a fabulous job and kept the room clean, leaving \"towel art\" on the bed and replacing used towels whenever they were needed she also left us a can of mosi spray which came in very useful! The only downside to the room, if i wanted to be picky was that there was no kettle for that all important tea or coffee first thing in the morning, but you could go up to the restaurant and get one and bring it back! Not a major problem in the big scheme of things! We didnt use the pools as they were very busy with spring breakers from the States, needless to say the pool bars were busy too! The beach was wonderful, pure white sand, crystal blue water and plenty of loungers, what more could you ask for! Walked along the beach to Playa del Carmen several times and enjoyed Pina Coladas at Senor Frogs.

Truly you are not in room that much anyway. food in main dining was AMAZING, the Mexican place was delicious and I highly recommend going. We weren't too impressed with the Asian place, I wouldn't waste your time. We heard the steak place was really good but it turned cold that one night and it's outside with no doors. Beer is all Dos Equis, and we tired of beer real quick, so just pace yourself on the drinks. Margaritas were good too. If you want more liquor just ask. At RIU Playacar they actually add shots of tequila in it and are much stronger. It's worth going up there, a more lively crowd too. The beach is abolutely beautiful, we kayaked, water so clear. IT's hard to find pool chairs if you don't go save some by 7:30 ish. Just lay some towels or flipflops where you want to sit. Beach has tons and never a problem to find any. Carlos was a terrific bartender in the main bar inside, but this place has no doors, except your room. We did a tour with Edventure tours of the cenotes and we highly recommend this tour.

The Yucatan, in fact all the Riu\u2019s sit within a gated community and when you first arrive it looks like there is nowhere to go, no shops or anything but by the time day light arrived we had established that you can walk, very safely from the hotel, to the other Riu\u2019s and right into Playa Del Carmen. The walk itself is a good 30 minutes and apart from a little plaza in Playa Car there is nothing to see on your walk except residential houses. Overall we loved it, it definitely had a party feel to it and there were hardly any small kids, a few spring breakers but they were no bother at all, in fact we both commented how had they been British teens they would have been fighting by tea time! Great for couples \u2013 if you are a family I would try the Tequila instead. Reception When we arrived at the hotel we were given a little induction, which explained about the hotel, its facilities etc. We were advised we could use the other Riu\u2019s but not the Palaces. The people on reception spoke very good English and apart from one incident where I wanted a bottle of vodka but they would not let me have one, they were super helpful at all times. The reception area was beautiful, it had the actual reception plus a bar, toilets, a shop and various other things, there was always loads of people about. It had a real market square feel about it. Pool and public areas The pool was fantastic, it was split into two main pools, one with a swim up bar, one tiny kids pool and another separate pool with a swim up bar with tables and stools in the pool. One of the larger pools had sun loungers built in so you could \u2018lie\u2019 on the water. They were very clean and well maintained. The water was not heated but I did not find it cold. There were two further bars that were open during the day, one attached to the pool the other set back with tables and chairs. There was also a refreshments counter where you could help yourself to Nacho\u2019s, juices, coke\u2019s etc. All the public areas were kept exceptionally clean and tidy, there was always a team of people discreetly blowing leaves, watering plants, cleaning marks off walls etc. There was quite a bit of wildlife, monkeys, huge lizards and these funny things that looked like huge rats but with no tails, they were very cute. Only down side to this was on a morning the birds woke you and kept you awake no matter what! Pool towels were provided and changed as often as you liked. Bedroom Our bedroom was a good size with two queen beds pushed together, two chairs and a small table, a TV, plenty of drawers etc. our balcony had chairs, a table and a dryer. There was an archway into the bathroom which had curtains which could be closed. The bathroom had wardrobes down one wall with a free safe, ironing board and iron, then a sink with large marble top. The shower was a good size and there was always plenty of hot water, the loo was behind another door. Plenty of towels and a hairdryer. The rooms were cleaned every day. There was also a mini fridge and optics. These were restocked most days, we left $2 in the fridge with a note for more diet coke and we got it. The only problem I had with the mini bar was one day we ran out of vodka, we phoned reception and asked for some more, when it did not appear my fella went to reception and they said that we could not have any. I was not happy about this because every day at around 6.30pm they phoned our room and asked if we had everything we needed, on the only day they don\u2019t phone we blummin needed something! So I went down (when you want a job doing and all that) and insisted that they give us some vodka, in a hilarious moment the guy at reception said \u2018lady, we can\u2019t have our guests walking around with bottles of vodka\u2019, but they did bring me one in the end. The balcony overlooked the walk ways, this is standard for the hotel as the rooms are split into blocks overlook the various paths that run from the hotel to the pool/beach. Restaurants & Facilities There were 4 restaurants, one main buffet area, a Steak House, Asian Restaurant and Mexican Restaurant. You had to book the latter 3 on a morning at breakfast, there were 2 sittings in each of these, we did book one day but ended up cancelling it as had other things going on. That said the main buffet area was fantastic and there was no need to go anywhere else, it was huge with LOADS to choose from. They had different theme nights every night and there was always a stall outside with cocktails. I don\u2019t even know where to begin explaining the food. There were huge salad bars, soups, breads, cheeses, usually an area with Mexican food, always a big (i say big I mean massive) joint of beef or turkey, stews, pizza, pasta dishes including fresh pasta cooked to order with a sauce of your choice. Loads of fish, including big paella\u2019s and the biggest king prawns that I have ever seen. The choice was endless. There was also a choice for those people who ate nothing but hot dogs, burgers and chips! Desserts were ice cream, various fruit, cakes, cookies, jelly sweets, marshmallows, plus a hot dessert. The service in the restaurant was good, you could help yourself to cokes, beer and wine but they served you at the table anyway. Lunch was similar, breakfast was just something else. There was a whole juice and smoothie bar, hot food like bacon, eggs, sausages, nachos, loads of cereals, yoghurts, fruits bread cheeses jam etc. Waffles, pancakes, eggs cooked to order. It was fantastic. You could have lunch at the steak house or Mexican but the choice was not as good, though completely adequate. On site there were a few shops, a chemist and a spa. The spa was expensive compared to the treatments in town. Oh, there was a gym but I did not go anywhere near that! Entertainment The entertainment team were fantastic and worked relentlessly. There was so much going on, volley ball, water polo, football, stuff for the kids, bingo with the most hilarious bingo caller. Then on a night they put on shows which were great, things like a Michael Jackson Tribute and Rocky Horror. We over heard someone complaining that it \u2018was hardly Las Vegas\u2019 but if you want Vegas go to Vegas! I thought they made a good effort and although not my cup of tea, it was pleasant all the same. Afterwards there was usually salsa dancing or a mariachi band. On an evening there were 2 bars open around the \u2018theatre\u2019 area, both near the pool, plus the main bar in reception. Service was quick and efficient. The bar nearest the beach caught a bit of a sea breeze and I had wished I had taken a jacket. We did have a wander over to the Tequila one night, there were tons of kids! Loads of them, and the entertainment seemed more geared for them. We used the nightclub once but the spirits tasted vile so we did not go back. There was a \u2018disco\u2019 a few nights in our hotel above reception but it was tiny. Beach The beach was FANTASTIC, though a little busy (mainly due to the two hotels either side) there was always plenty of beds available, the sand was practically white, it never got too hot to walk on and the sea was azure blue, only downside was when you were snorkelling it was so white and clear there was nothing to see! There was a nice breeze on the beach but don\u2019t be fooled, the sun was very strong and we burnt even using a SPF20 and we never do in Europe. The water sports on the beach all seemed safe and well organised but if you want to dive go to a dive shop in town, its much cheaper. Tipping I stressed myself out before this trip worrying about tipping! We took some $1 bills with us solely for this purpose. We did tip the maid (once) and the person who filled the fridge (when we wanted something) we occasionally tipped the bar staff, if the service had been particularly good or if we had sat a one bar for a few hours we would leave something for the bar man. Some people tipped a lot others not much at all, in my mind it did not affect the service, the only time when it did was when the bars were VERY busy and if you waved some money about you got served first. We occasionally tipped taxi drivers. All this business about them preferring dollars to pesos is because they keep the dollars until the exchange rate is in their favour then cash them in. Pesos were widely used and happily accepted. Well that\u2019s it, if you have any questions please don\u2019t hesitate to message me. I would have no hesitate in recommending this hotel and would go back there without a second thought.", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "British Columbia", "Title": "\u201cDont listen to the negative reviews, resort was great!\u201d", "Author": "JerryandLee-Anne35", "ReviewID": "UR59842505", "Content": "First of all in reviews I think its important to know who is writing the review, perspective is everything. My wife and I are in our mid 30s, Canadian, and were traveling with friends to Yucatan. We have been to Cuba as well as Porta Plata. This was our first time in Mexico. We stayed at the Yucatan from March 5th until March 19th. Our previous resorts were about 4 and a half stars ( Breezes, Occidental). Arriving at the resort on March 5th I was a little skeptical from reading some negative reviews about the resort. To say the least I was pleasantly supprised. The lobby was beautifull and the staff was very friendly right from the get go, their english was also very good compared to previous resorts we have been to. Ill break it down to give anyone traveling there an idea of what to expect. Rooms: The rooms were nothing too fancy. The typical tacky colours that weve encountered at previous resorts but clean and fairly roomy. There is a stocked mini fridge in every room as well as hard alcohol bottles on the wall ( think vodka, rum, tequila, and something else). The fridge is stocked with a few types of soda, as well as beer and bottled water, it is stocked every second day. The beds were two double beds pushed together to make one big bed. Some people in previous reviews complained how hard the beds are, they are definatly firm but I like a firmer bed and truthfully had a better sleep here than on my expensive bed at home. The only negative thing about the room is the dampness feeling and bit of musty smell. This is to be expected in a tropical humid climate, if you keep the ceiling fan going and the screen door open and minimize the A/C during the day it seems to help. There is a in room safe and balcony off every room. Our particular room overlooked the jungle path to the beach area. We woke to the monkeys all most every morning the first week, which I liked, but it got a bit old for the wife. Food: Heres were I cant believe the negative reviews, unless your used to caviar and the finest of dining the food is great. You could fill your plate 6 times probably and never have the same thing on it. The desserts were second to none, usually some sort of fresh roast or turkey being carved at dinner, pasta station, all sorts of salads, lots of fish, and delicious salsa, guacamoli, and the fixings for nachos, the typcial hambugers, hotdogs, and alot of other stuff. Breakfast was from 7 till 10:30. Lunch served near beach from around 11:00 until 3 or so I think. The main buffet served lunch from 1 until 3. If you go hungry at this resort your doing something wrong. Dinner is served from 6:30 until 10:00 at the buffet. There are also 3 ala carts. Steakhouse, Asian, and Mexican. We did the steakhouse twice while we were there and our friends tried the Asian once. The steakhouse is great but you have to book it fairly early in the morning to get a reservation. To be honest though the buffet is so good and lets you have flexibility in your time, that we stuck with the buffet most of the time. A few nights on our second week there, the buffet was fairly busy at dinner time, we just waited until after 7:30 or so and it seemed a bit quieter. The buffets displayed georgeous ice sculptures, and fruit carvings and had a classy touch for a buffet. The waiters would come by your table almost immediatly to offer wine, water, beer, whatever you want. Also if you finish with your plate they are there in a flash taking it away for you. The service was second to none. Bars: There are two swimup bars in the large pool. The one was usually pretty busy and filled with a younger spring break sorta crowd but the other one was usually a little quieter and more of a mixed crowd. I think they were open from 10:00 am until around 6:00 or something like that. There are also two gazebo style bars beside the pool and entertainment area that are pretty much in the middle of all the action and we found ourselves sitting by these ones most evenings. They were open from around 10:00 until about 12:00 am. Jose was our favorite bartender, he works the evening shift there and was great. The booze was very good. They had Havana Club Amber rum which is my favorite I found in Cuba. They also have Kalua, and pretty much every kind of booze you can think of. As previous reviews said, they dont have some of the premium whiskeys but their local stuff was good. There beer on tap is Douce XX , it was very good, in fact for draft, it was better than draft in Canada in my opinion. I recommend Dirty Bananas, Miami Vice, and they make a good Paralyser also. The bartenders are all friendly and tipping isnt expected but we tipped a little and lets just say we never finished our drink before Jose had poured us another. There is also a lobby bar that is open 24/7. In reading about the resort before I left I wasnt sure of this, but it is open all night. The disco bar is open from 11:00 until 2:00 I think. Some nights if it was too quiet I think they closed a little earlier. The busier disco is the one at the Tequila, we went a couple of nights, its pretty packed though, but fun. Again you have access to all the bars and entertainment at Tequila, Playacar and Lupita resorts. We found we like ours the best by far but did visit the others a couple of times. Entertainment: Entertainment was pretty good. They had a live band playing every night by the pool area from about 7 until about 8, then a kids show would go for a half hour, involving kids on stage and they seemed to have a great time. After the kids show the main show would start. The show was different every night, but repeated the second week. Micheal Jackson was our favourite but all of them were pretty good. Again you can take in other shows at the other resorts as well. After the show, the band would play again until midnight. All the bands we heard were very good. Beach: The beach was very nice white sand, blue water. All the sandbags are gone now as well, which was nice. There is no snorkeling right in front of the resort but for 30 dollars they will take you in a boat for 15 mins ride to a great reef, I strongly recommend it. We had no trouble in getting a chair on the beach, we arnt real early risers either, we would go to the beach around 10:00, although sometimes shade was scarce. They were planting more trees when we were there so there is more and more shade areas every day. The beach is full of people but large enough to accomidate them all. The sand is soft and asside from a few shells and coral, easy on the feet swimming. The pool area was full early every day. I think the older people put towels on the chairs first thing in the morning to reserve them even though its crap and your not suppost to do this. It didnt bother us much though because we were there for the beach, not a pool. Staff: The staff here went above and beyond any resort or hotel staff Ive encountered. You couldnt pass a gardener, maid, or any worker without them smiling and saying Hi to you. I never seen one rude staff member, even though Im sure some people give them reason to be rude. We were asked on several occasions while we were there if we needed anything, were our rooms fine, etc... Grounds: The grounds at the Yucatan were very lush. They were constantly being cleaned, rails painted, raked, etc. There was several animals on the ground, these giant ginipig sorta looking things, howler monkeys, and racoony sorta animals were common. Also Iguanas were around, and a few types of birds. If your looking to feel tropical, this is the place for you. General: This resort was perfect for what my wife and I wanted. That being said, remember that is my opinion and some people like to be pampered more etc. This resort is classified a 5 star and compared to the 4.5 stars we stayed at before it definatly is. But there are fancier more plush 5 stars, I think there almost needs to be more stars in the rating system to allow people to choose the fancier resorts if they want that. We spoke with other couples who came to our resort from the Riu Palaces, they said their rooms and lobby etc. was beautifull but it was too quiet and everyting pretty much went to sleep after 11:00pm. This may be a plus for some people and I thnk they had waiter service on their beach as well. For what I was looking for this sounded too stuffy and not as fun. Also the Yucatan is way more lush and tropical feeling than the neighbouring Palaces. We visited the Playacar and Tequila and if you are deciding between these two I would pick the Tequila, even though it isnt right on the beach, it was a very nice resort and more lush like the Yucatan. I found the Playacar fairly plain and not feeling as 5 starish as Tequila and Yucatan . As for negatives, there isnt that many. If I had to pick any I would say spring breakers kind of wore on our nerves a few times. The resort advertises no spring breakers allowed but there was several. I dont mind partying with younger people but they have to start yelling and screaming all the time. Also the few nights we did go to bed a bit earlier ( few and far between) they were pretty loud all night screaming down the paths. I think it was the time of year we went though, for the most part it didnt bother us. The mosquitoes werent that bad at all, we had bug bites on our legs but I think that was from sand fleas. In summery I would strongly recomment this resort. There is a good mix of people from 70 to 20 years old. The surrounding shopping in Playa Del Carmen is only a 5 dollar cab ride away and everything feels safe and friendly.

Our first real vacation since our son was born and we needed a break and some couple time! We have previously stayed at the RIU Cancun and at the Marival in Nuevo Vallarta. We were happy with the RIU in Cancun and new what to expect, so thought we would try another location. The food at the main buffet at the Yucatan was wonderful! The best out of all 3 AI's we have been too. We also tried the Asian and Mexican restaurant. Both were alright, but honestly, we thought the main buffet was better. This is the exact opposite of what we had come to expect, since at the other two places the restaurants we far superior. Beer served was dos equis (XX) and hubby was happy about that. I drank mostly Miami Vices, and I always asked for them to make it with Bacardi. They will use the cheap rum otherwise. We mostly went to the bar in the main lobby, because they made the best drinks. ALot of bartenders will just splash some rum in with the frozen drinks from the machine, but this bar actually blended it with fresh ice. MUCH better. Carlos was a great bartender and alot of fun. We watched him make some \"boom-boom\" shots for another group and he saw that we were amused and made us some too :) We also watched him make some flaming shots people had to drink froma straw quickly so it didn't melt while the shot was still on fire, and even some virgin boom-boom shots for a youngster at the bar (basically a shirley temple in a shot glass). The rooms were pretty basic hotel rooms. We didn't spend much time in the room, so this wasnt too important to us. Everything worked and was for the most part clean. None of them face the ocean and I honestly don't think any location was better than another, so I would not pay more for a room upgrade. The beds were hard, but we knew they would be, they were at the RIU in Cancun too. Ask for a topper, they really do help! We had to ask twice because they didn't get one on the first night. The grounds are very nice because they are more established than other resorts we've been too. Tall mature trees. My hubby is a landscaper and an outdoorsman and he was very impressed with the fact they it seemed they built around the existing trees instead of planting new young plants. Overall, we were both happy with the trip and wish we could have stayed longer. Hubby would like to go back to the same resort again. I on the otherhand, was satisfied and content with my stay, but like to go to new places and expirience new things, so would prefer to try someplace new. Hope this helps!

Yes the rooms have a musty smell when you first check in. I think every review of every hotel we researched in the area has that. So expect it. However once you are there it either goes away or you don't notice. The rooms are comfortable and functional. The beds are either separate twin beds, or two twins pushed together to make on massive king bed. However when they do this, it's still separate sheets sets for each, which makes it a little difficult to get romantic. The bathroom has a shower, large sink and counter and a smaller \"closet' for the toilet bowl. In our room was a mini bar and a liquor dispense. We used the mini bar a little--mostly for water and Pepsi, but never used the liquor dispenser. Our room was on the third floor and we had a large balcony. Other reviewers have stated the beds are hard. Yes they are, and I loved them! The rooms were cleaned every day. We've read some reviews about not getting enough towels. We never had this problem, but we always hung our towels up to dry and reused them, instead of getting fresh ones every day. Check-in and check-out was a breeze, staff is fantastic, always with a smile and a \"Hola!\" The pool area is nice, but you have to get up early and put something on a chair to reserve a spot by the pool--which we never did. We were more interested in the beach, which was great as well. There were always chairs available on the beach and the water was always pleasant. The food was about what we expected. Very similar to food you'd find on a cruise ship. Three times we made reservation to the specialty restaurants, but we only made it to one of them. The others we were just too busy having fun. But the buffet food was great and each night had a little different theme. Breakfast was about the same each morning. Everything from fresh fruit and cereals to meat and eggs. Lunches are served down by the beach and pool and feature standard Mexican and Amercan food. None of this food will be featured on the cover of Bon Appetite magazine. It's similar to most mid-level US restaurants. The beverages for the most part were good as well, but you need to specify if you want a particular alcohol, or send it back if it's not strong enough. The house stuff is not all that good. The Cuban gin is undrinkable. Likewise the wine is atrocious. If you want a wine with your meal, find a liquor store in town and bring your own. My wife thought the massage by the beach was outstanding. We were impressed that every day somebody was working on something. One day they were touching up paint on a building. The next day they were working on the lights the line the walkways between building. There is always somebody working on something to keep it clean, fresh and updated. We had a great time and would happily return.", "Date": "March 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat trip to RIU Yucatan\u201d", "Author": "CdnFamilyToronto", "ReviewID": "UR59380650", "Content": "My family and I just got back from our 1 week trip to RIU Yucatan March 13-20th 2010. - which is Spring Break. We are a family of 5 (2 teens and one 5 yr old). Overall it was great. We previously stayed at RUI Cancun so we had previous RUI experience. It was fairly similar to RUI Cancun but instead of high rise building (at RUI Cancun) this had \"Hacienda style\" which is a fancy way of saying \"low rise 3 story buildings\" for hotel rooms. Flight AeroMexico with transfer in Mexico City - very long trip but reduced the flight cost for 5 people by 5 people by $1500. Flight ok. Shuttle from Cancun airport to RIU Yuctan we bought flights separately so we had to pay for our own transportation to the resort. They charged us $100USD for family of 5 private in a minivan taxi to the resort and we paid $80USD going back to the airport. We need to learn to negotiate better. RIU Yucatan We had 2 hotel rooms (one for the kids) and they put us near the pool/beach and we thought it was a good location until we went to bed our first night. It turned out our room balcony overlooked the open-air theatre/disco where the nightly entertainment took place. It was extremely loud and we couldn't sleep. we had to change rooms for our 2nd night to a room that was further away from the theatre/disco. The second room was lovely and quiet. Resort overall this is a great resort for those who appreciate lush greenery and tropical forests. all the walkways had a canopy of trees and greenery and there were 2 spots that had a \"mini tropical forest\" that was lovely. there are lots of animals and birds on the resort ie these funny looking \"rabbits\" and supposedly there are monkeys - but we never say any. There are lots of palm trees on the beach to seek shade. Food We thought the food was pretty good. It seemed that FRiday & Sat night the buffet food was better then the rest of the week ie smoked salmon, caviar (yes, I said caviar), etc. Only saw these at the buffet saturday night. Wide variety, never went hungry. We ate at 2 of the 3 specialty restaurants: ate at the steakhouse (better than I expected - they actually know how to cook a \"rare\" steak & a \"medium rare\" steak). and ate at the Asian restaurant (this consisted of chinese food mostly with some sushi. someone told us that the \"fried ice cream\" is a must - I tried it, didn't like the batter... Wanted to try to Mexican restaurant but never made it there. Drinks The wine at the resort was hideous! Don't even try it. Either do without or bring you own! I didn't even get a \"buzz\" off the fancy drinks ie pina colada etc. I liked the Margaritas but no buzz. beer is your best bet. Specialty restaurants: you have to go in person to make a reservation for these specialty restaurants. You can only make the reservation for the morning of the night you want to eat there & the reservation desk opens at 7am! the lineup starts about 6:40. they offer 2 sittings: 6:45pm sitting and 8:45pm sitting. We have a young child so we only wanted the 6:45pm sitting. If you want the 6:45pm sitting, you must get in line BEFORE 6:45am, especially if you're a larger group. It's annoying but reality. if you want the later sitting, you can make your reservation later - 7:30? 8:30? not sure... Advice: bring small ziplocks so you can pack snacks ie banana chips, nuts, dried fruit from the buffet etc if you're going off resort for an excursion or even down at the beach. REsort activities everyday my husband & kids did water activities that were free included with the resort - catamaran: I think they had 4 ...just had to reserve it, almost always available - windsurfing: my husband did this everyday. they were always available - sea kayaking: my husband did the everyday. one of the more popular options, don't think he had difficulty getting access - boogie boards - #1 most popular water toy. lots of waves - Sea-Doos (extra cost) right at the beach Staff organized activities but were slow to get activities started on our 1 rainy day - disappointing. rainy day is the real time we needed activities for the kids. ADvice: make sure to pick up all your belongings at the end of day at the beach or poolside - we lost lots of items ie sandals, jackets & towels. Beach Amazing. Tons of lounge chairs, lots of sunny spots & shady spots & lots of space. The waves were perfect for my 13 yr old but my 5 yr old didn't like them because they knocked her over (she wore her lifejacket from home). Beach volleyball everyday. Resort has dive shop at the beach & dive boats right at the beach (not sure why people would dive in Mayan Riveria when Cozumel is across the way but to each their own...) Advice: bring a life jacket for young kids to play in the waves or to go snorking. Dive operators don't have sizes for little kids. Scuba/snorkling We went for 1 day of scuba at Cozumel (10 mins by taxi to ferry, then 40 min ferry across to Cozumel) 2nd best scuba/snorkling in the world! We went with Eagle Ray Divers who was recommended to us and they were the best dive operation we've ever been hdiving with. We highly recommended them. www.EagleRayDivers.com My 3 kids went snorkling while we went scuba diving - wonderful experience and we had an amazing Mexican lunch by the beach. if you bring kids - bring own life jacket & snorkling gear - didn't have much gear for kids.

We had a day trip to Xcaret , which i would recomend you see , as it gives you a very good overview of the history and culture of Mexico , and the 2 hour show at the end is worth the admission price alone.

I feel that this 4 star rating is correct. Overall, this place is amazing. Yes, a little dated, but kept in tiptop condition; infact the decorators were about painting some of the buildings whilst we were there. The rooms are in good condition, though we found the beds rather hard but this was rectified with all call to reception for some mattresses toppers which they bought up. In the room you have a hairdryer, iron and board, TV, local spirits (which are totally gross!) and basic toiletries and 2 double beds. The room does smell rather musty and damp but once you open patio door and turn on the fan and air con, it soon goes. This is a humid country so an element of this has to be expected. As I mentioned, the local spirits I found to be particularly horrid but there are some international spirits available in the bars at no extra cost which I liked. Checkin was very quick and I managed to change rooms so that I was on the top floor of block \"3\". The reception staff are very friendly and will help you in any way they can. The hotel has monkeys living in the jungle and they do have a tendancy to be VERY noisy from 4am to 6am. I was woken many mornings and though annoying, it was kind of nice being in the jungle! Take some earplugs!! The main buffet restaurant was quite busy but well maintained. Great food and great selections. Food for all! We did try one of the A La Carte restaurants (The Steakhouse) but was not impressed because these restaurants are NOT A la Carte but a set menu with a choice of main. They choose the starter and dessert so its really a Table D'Hote restaurant. We managed to get a table when we went for breakfast at 10am so you do not have to be up early to reserve like previous reviews have mentioned. I preferred to eat in the main restaurant as there was more choice. No complaints with the food here! During the day there is hot food available almost anywhere within the pool areas all day. The pool bars are very clean and the staff are very efficient. The new beach is absolutely awsome. We walked to Playa Del Carmen most days. Lovely white powdery sand. There are plenty of sunbeds for everyone though the exact location might not be ideal after 11am. We never had an issue. We toured Cozumel for the day which was really good though rushed by the guide which I suppose must be expected. Great snorkeling. We also went to CoCo Bongo in Playa Del Carmen. This place is mental and has to be experienced. It only cost us \u00a330 to get in and the drinks were flowing all night. We left at 4am. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

We've previously stayed at the Riu Palace Las Americas in Cancun, so we settled on another Riu resort. The Hotel ------------------------------ The Riu Palace really was a 5-star hotel, while the Riu Yucatan was more like a 4-star. The food was actually just as good as the Riu Palace, with a huge selection of items available. You can opt for the \"speciality\" restaurants, but you basically get the same food served at the main dining hall. The rooms were nice and featured a very firm bed. We requested a pillow top and someone was quickly there to set it up...much better! There were occasional small bugs, but you're surrounded by flora & trees, so of course you'll see a few...especially if you have your balcony doors open. The grounds were nicely groomed and the staff was incredibly friendly. I noticed that at the other Riu and it really makes for a pleasant stay. Since it's all-inclusive, you have all of the free food & drink available nearly 24 hours. The bars don't open until 10 or 10:30am and most shut down around 11pm. The bar in the lobby is open all night though. Speaking of the lobby, it was always crowded with people at night. It was a nice socializing spot and had free wi-fi access. The Staff/Entertainment -------------------------- The Riu staff did a great job, not only with room service and check-in, but also organizing all of the events throughout the day. There's always something going on, whether it's volleyball on the beach, dance lessons by the pool or a ping pong tournament. It really made a huge difference having a very friendly/funny staff around all day. All of the bartenders were smiling and laughing all day....can't say enough about that! The Beach ---------------------------- Wow, what a step up from Cancun's beaches! The beaches were nearly perfect. Lots of room and lots of chairs everywhere. A far cry from our previous experience in Cancun. There was no drink service to the beach, but Riu staff constantly came by to pick up empty cups which was nice. A+ on the beach atmosphere!

When we checked in we were asked if we felt lucky. We're on vacation-you bet. So we got a free up-grade. We were with a large group and were the only ones to get upgraded. Sweet! The weather was beautiful along with the beaches. We spent from 9 in the morning until 4:30ish in the afternoons on the beach. There were thousands of people up and down but we never felt crowded. We always found chairs. The food was good. I wouldn't say great but it was good. We ate at the steak house one night and the Mexican place another. We really liked both. We had two people with us that only eat steak so we tried several times to make reservations at the steakhouse only to be told they were full or had to take the 8:45 time slot. And my husband and I were early risers so for it to be full at 7:15 a.m. was strange to us. As for breakfast, we were very disappointed that there was no peanut butter on the buffet. And each morning it was the same menu so my husband and I decided to go to the Tequilla one morning and the Playacar the next and both had peanut butter on their buffet but pretty much the same menu. I would say if you go hungry, it's you own fault as you can find SOMETHING good to eat on the buffet, be it breakfast, dinner or supper. We didn't sleep well but we don't really know why. The double beds together was strange. Wouldn't a queen be easier for the maids? But I still don't think that was why we didn't sleep well. I guess once the sun was up, so were we! The monkeys at 3 a.m. was one morning. They were very loud but you are in the jungle! I can't say enough about our maid, Elizabeth! Our room was spotless! The Michael Jackson show was fun to watch. We watch a few others but usually headed uptown. We went to Congo Bongos one night-a must for music lovers. Visited the Blue Parrot, the Beer Bucket-which was a ton of fun, along with several others. We did quite a bit of shopping also. It's shopping heaven and for those that like to dicker, you will get a good deal! We always went uptown after supper when the cruise ships were gone. We did the Tulum Xtreme with the Aventuras Mayas group. This was visiting the Mayan Ruins in Tulum, three different ziplines, rappeling, and snorkling in an underground cave. I highly recommend this excursion! All three guide we had made the trip so much fun and enjoyable. I also parasailed through our hotel. I had never done this before and it was also awesome! This is our 4th vacation to the tropicals. We stayed at the El Dorado Royale (inbetween Cancun and Playa), the Beach Palace in Cancun and at a Sandels in Jamaica. They all had their good points but we all agreed that this resort pretty much would have the best over-all rating. It had everything we look for in a vacation. Would we go back?--probably if we didn't have a promise to each other to not visit the same place twice. The world is to big for that! But we are impressed with the Rui's.", "Date": "March 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quebec", "Title": "\u201cAverage-good, not a 5 star\u201d", "Author": "glamorous_girl", "ReviewID": "UR58046954", "Content": "My family and I took a trip over March Break, When we got there our first impression was it was a terrible resort.

Arrived in late February for a 6 day stay. Transport from airport to resort took quite a while (lots of stopping/sitting in traffic for long stretches) due to road construction just north of Playa Del Carmen. Recommend asking the driver to avoid some of the backup on the main road by using local streets where possible. Not an issue once at the resort or getting into Playa Del Carmen itself. Rooms are nice size with A/C (operates very quietly, a pleasant surprise), ceiling fan and balcony. Beds are not comfortable (unless you like sleeping on what feels like hard rubber). Bed linens were clean but rather dull.. Bathrooms are good size but shower stall itself is dark (there is no light source in the shower, very strange). The staff is very nice and eager to please. Meals were generally good but somewhat repetitive. We took a taxi into town twice for dinner, a nice break from the resort. I recommend both restaurants: El Fogon and Bamba Jarocha (seafood). Both are open air local restaurants, nothing fancy in decor (reminded me of fast food restaurant interiors) but the food is very good, very reasonably priced and you get a much greater sense of local culture. We took a day trip to Tulum and enjoyed touring the Mayan ruins. Not so much fun was the transport. We got on one bus that took us to the parking lot of a local mall where we were dropped off to wait for 10-15 minutes for another bus to come pick us up to go to Tulum (the original bus was taking others to a different excursion). Our trip to Tulum cost $45 (USD) per person and included a short guided tour. In retrospect, it may have cost about the same to hire a guide directly. My recommendation is to price the tours you wish to take ahead of time and then see if you can hire your own personal guide to pick you up and drop you off at the hotel for a similar cost. That would also allow you to schedule tours at convenient times for you vs. the tour operators. The highlight of our trip was a visit to The Little Mexican Cooking School in Puerto Morelos. www.thelittlemexicancookingschool.com If you enjoy cooking (or enjoy eating outstanding home cooked Mexican cuisine), I highly recommend attending one of the classes. It is not an inexpensive excursion ($100 per person for the class, $30 for cab ride to that location and $35 back - all prices in USD). But truly worth every penny and more. It is about a 25-30 minute drive from the resort. If you book the class, recommend you mapquest driving directions in advance and bring with you as no one at the hotel has any clue about this place and the cab driver knew how to get to Puerto Morelos but was unfamiliar with the town once off the freeway. Everyone involved (Katarina, the owner, Claudia the chef, Lucy and Daisy, the sous chefs) are delightful and work very hard to educate you about the ingredients and cultural history that go into authentic mexican cooking and ensure you have a great time while learning. Classes are limited to 10 people maximum, alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks are served throughout. Once everything is cooked, everyone sits down to enjoy the incredibly delicious meal. We left with a hand sewn (by Lucy) apron and a mexican cookbook. There is also a little shop with local foodstuffs and clay pottery (cash only, the school does not take credit cards on site). Weather was great during our stay and we enjoyed the beach and the pool. Although we never had issues finding loungers either at the beach or pool, both are very crowded - if you are looking for a resort that affords allot of personal space in the common areas - this resort is not for you. The restored beach is very nice and you can walk all the way into town (and 5th avenue) on the beach (~25 minute walk). If you want a lower cost beach vacation, with great weather and nice (but not great) amenities, this is a great choice.", "Date": "March 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGreat beach, bad wine.\u201d", "Author": "Blue_Crab", "ReviewID": "UR57806463", "Content": "Feb 27 - Mar 3, 2010. This was our fourth visit to RIU Yucatan, so you know we must like it. Normally we use Apple Vacations but this time we went with CheapCarribbean. We flew on Mexicana on an Airbus 319. Their service was excellent, but the inflight food they tout on their website was disappointing. However, the meals were complimentary as were the cocktails and the movie. We flew from Dulles International. Check in at the hotel was quick and easy thanks to Ana and Felix. Our room was clean and nicely furnished. The mini bar and fridge were stocked with beer, soft drinks, water, and a variety of booze. A safety box is provided at no charge. There is an iron and ironing board and a hair dryer. The beds are hard, but comfortable. The only place we experienced insects was in the lobby around some of the lounges and chairs. They are very tiny, and we call them \"no see im's\", but they may be some sort of small mesquito. They don't bother some people, but they bit my ankles and lower legs. So I wore long pants and socks when we socialized in the lobby before dinner. Bug spray like \"OFF\" might also work. By the way, they were not in the restaurant. The beach erosion from the hurricanes of the past two years is history now. The white sand beach is over 100 yards wide with a gentle slope, almost flat, from the hotel to the surf. It's one of the best beaches in the area. We had five days of very nice weather. Strong breezes sometimes made it cooler than normal, and the surf was rough enough for the red flags at times. The beach was full of sunbathers everyday, but there was never a problem getting lounges. The pool water is very cold, but the swim up bars make it worth it. Beer du jour is now Dos XX's instead of the ubiquitous Corona. The wine was not good, but it never has been. The white was okay, but the red was inferior. We are going to suggest to RIU that they charge an extra $10 per day and provide quality wine. Also, next time we go, we're going to buy some good wine in town and take it to dinner with us. The food was very good although the beef was only fair. They do best with pork, chicken and fish, and the steamed shrimp was excellent. The soups were almost always good. Breakfast selections are top notch. Desserts, fresh fruits, and cheeses were excellent. The specialty restaurants are overrated. The wait staff and bartenders are very friendly, efficient, and competent. We never had to wait very long for anything. The entertainment varied from mediocre to good. The Mariachis were not up to par. They did have some good bands for dancing before and after the nightly floor shows. The Olympic hockey match between U.S. and Canada was on all the TV's at the sports bar across the street at the RIU Tequila and the place was packed. Of course when the Canadians broke the tie in OT, the roof came off the place. We'll post some photos later.

The place is nice and the rooms are nice, but they could have been a little cleaner, not bad thought. We had a Jr Suite, it was very nice, I just wished it faced the ocean and not trees. There are no Ocean/Beach View or walkout suites, if you are wanting to see a great sunrise do not pick this hotel. If you want to spend more go to the Royal Playa, it's adults only and is first class, you pay for what you get. Another nice place is the Oberostar Tucan next to the RIU, I believe it is a nice step above this place. Another place that was suprisingly good was the Coco Bay Resort, we where surprised to see that this was a nice smaller resort at a pretty good price. I would stay at the Coco before the RIU, it's smaller put the put a little in the detal. There are many nicer resorts in this area, I would only stay here if is was a terrific deal.

The staff are so friendly from cleaners, gardeners, bars and food halls, nothing is too much trouble for these people.

They offer the Palace on arrival - need to be sure you don't or do want to go there. Not sure if it would cost more. It seems they overbook the Yucatan because it is so popular.

The howler monkeys are very entertaining. You can rent catamarans and kayaks down at the scuba caribe dive center at no extra charge. If you have never been parasailing, this is a must. Scuba Caribe would be the only company that I would recommend as they are professionals and right next to the hotel. I personally would not stay at this hotel again only because of the rooms but like I said if you get a good price(under 1600 for 2 for 5 nights then it is not bad) I would rather spend a little more money and upgrade to the Royal or the RIU Palace. The Royal has amazing restaurants and the food and accomodations are truly 5 star. 5th Avenue is fun, the shops close at 10. If you love massages, go to VERONICAS on 5th, they are professional massuers and are amazing. My husba nd and I did the couples massage. Very relaxing and only 30 each.

Rooms: cheesy Mexican flair with a King bed that consisted of two twin beds made up separately. The beds themselves were ROCK HARD. Ask for a foam topper and you'll be fine. Oh and the sheets were stained. Yes, stained. Pretty nasty. The shower didn't drain until you were done showering which was pretty gross. Food: If you wish to dine at the hotel for dinner, you have to make your reservations at 7am to ensure you have a seat. The Mexican restaurant did NOT serve Mexican food. The asian was pretty good overall, but buffet. Steak house was seated dining and fair. Lunch buffets had zero flavors and was the same everyday. I would recommend dining in La Hacienda as they have more choices. Noise: LOUD. Even though Spring Breakers are not 'allowed' at the hotel, there were definitely youngsters partying it up to the wee hours in the morning. We were consistently woken up by banging doors and loud screaming. Good times. Drinks: If you are looking for a good vodka or rum, bring your own. I repeat, BRING YOUR OWN. Their liquors are definitely watered down and somehow have a hint of tequila flavor to them. I mostly drank the beer since you really can't go wrong it. Beach: FABULOUS! They just redid the beaches in the area and they are amazing. Definitely spend the day there, rather than the loud pool area. In closing, if you are looking for a relaxing vacation with decent food and drinks, I would not recommend staying at the RIU Yucatan.

Ribeyes grilled to perfection - all courses served - no buffet...just be patient, as the service was rather slow. The beer is Dos XX. Red wine is just awful, white was ok once i got used to it.

We were offered to change hotels but decided not to and I'm glad that we didn't as the beach opened two days in and what a fab beach it is. The waves were such fun, the beach clean and many sunbeds, so no getting up at the crack of dawn to bag one! The animation team even bought out water to those of us lazing in the sun which was unexpected as the pool bar wasn't too far at all. That's service for you. The pool areas were kept clean and tidy but we didn't once see anyone cleaning the pool to be honest and two of us did fall ill with sickness and diroreah after swimming. After that, it was the beach for us and we enjoyed every minute. The food was fabulous. Anyone who says that there was no variety or it wasn't good, must live with a silver spoon in their mouth! The prawns were so plentiful and huge, I was in heaven every day. A great variety and like other reviews, stick to the buffet as it can't be beaten. Thanks to Vincente who made decorated our table for my birthday, poured champagne and got all the staff to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to me. He even organised a chocolate and strawberry birthday cake, but just the one candle as 40 would have melted it!! Our room on arrival smelled really damp and so we requested another and were instantly given 3 other room keys to look at which was good. We settled for room 1225 which was fine, so nothing was really too much trouble. If you go, make a visit to the rooms with a 3 as the monkeys live in the trees there and often make themselves known which was great! The weather was great, not too hot and only rained twice, although when it rains it really rains! Fifth Avenue was a mixture of posh shops and market/local shops all in together. A great selection of restaurants and bars which made the whole experience eclectic. We ate out once just for a change and can safely say that we should have gone back to the hotel. \"The Big Lobster\" is not a place that I would go to again....far inferior to the Hotel cuisine. The animation team were fabulous, always working very hard and long hours for a measley wage. The shows that they put on were good and this was mixed in with professional acts. \"Elvis\" truly loves himself but displayed professionism with his team at all times. \"Lester\" the little funny man was cute but couldn't salsa for toffee!! And \"Adrian\" was simply fabulous, no side to him, and always happy even when he was poorly. Take a trip to Xcaret and do the snorkling as that was fun and amazing. We booked ourselves and also took another independant trip with \"Angel\" who you'll find at the Plaza just a short distance from the hotel. He is NOT timeshare and organised a fab trip for us that incorporated Snorkling at Akumal, Coba ruins, Zip line over a crocodile lake, swimming in a Cenote and then back through Mayan Villages. A great day with \"Mother\" as out tour guide who stayed with us all day and was very funny. All this for $125 US Dollars - much cheaper than the Thomson deals. Coco Bongos in Playa is also a must - the show was fabulous. No need to go to Cancun to experience this as Coco Bongo is now in Playa. All in all we had a great time, relaxed and did exactly what we wanted. I would certainly recommend the hotel and don't panic about the beach.", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago burbs", "Title": "\u201cRiu Yacatan Playacare - a must for winter getaway!\u201d", "Author": "Alohababe", "ReviewID": "UR55963850", "Content": "Beautiful resort, even standard rooms are large and emaculate.

David & Dawn Mullins, Castleford, England Ian & Gill Hewitt, Castleford, England First of all, lets put to rest any worries about the state of the beach at this hotel. On the afternoon of Wednesday 27th January we arrived at the hotel and were interested to see what was going on at the beach. The beach was cordoned off to the public. There were 3 x JCB diggers and a crane working the beach, along with around 20 workers, extending piping which allowed the beach to be recomposed. The work went on through the night. On Saturday 30th January at 12.00 noon, the beach was made accessible and all the pipes had been removed. In fact they had been moved further north up towards Playa Del Carmen, for similar works there. I have included a photograph taken at 14:32 from the sea looking across the beach back towards the hotel. The diggers worked on Sunday to do the final levelling of the beach, which took less than a day. Now the rest of the holiday\u2026\u2026 our party of 4 walked to all the other RUI hotels in the locality to check on facilities, apart from the Palaces. The Yucatan was the best in our opinion. The rooms were spacious and cleaned everyday. (Thanks to Abdon our cleaner ). We were on block two one the ground floor and there was a certain odour about the place. I don\u2019t think the humidity helps. But towels were replaced everyday, beds made and there was always a well stocked mini bar. The Hacienda restaurant was excellent. Every meal had a good choice and the quality was excellent. We also tried the Mexican a la carte, but was not too impressed. We never got around to trying the Asian or Steak House a la cartes, there was no need to as the Hacienda was more than adequate. For the first few days the pool area was busy, probably due to holidaymakers not being able to get to the beach. There were lots on sun loungers but these were quickly taken up, and annoyingly, some not used despite being reserved with towels. The hotel has a policy of no reserving, but this is not policed. There is an abundance of wildlife freely roamimg the grassed areas of the hotel. Monkeys, iguanas and agoutis were all seen on a regular basis. The staff were probably the friendliest I have come across, always aiming to please and help make your holiday something to remember. Look up Rigobob, one of the Mexican animacion team, he\u2019s a scream !!! The \u2018whales\u2019 in the sea have all gone, the sea and beach are now to die for. In the local town, shopkeepers confront you to get you to look at their offerings which are \u201calmost free\u201d. However, a stern \u201cNo\u201d prevents continued hassle. A taxi into Playa Del Carmen was 50 pesos. Also, when leaving the country, make sure you pay the exit tax in pesos, 640, as it works out cheaper. There were several areas to contemplate. 1) if you suffer badly, as I am, when bitten by mosquitoes, you will suffer here. Look on the internet for preventative measures. We took vitamin B1 for two weeks before we went, but this didn\u2019t work. 2) Be aware of the hotels internal telephone system. We bought a $20 USD phone card which is supposed to give 45 minutes of calls. The first time ours was used it announced \u201829 minutes left\u2019. Also, every time you use your room phone, you will need to enter a \u20180\u2019 for an outside line. This costs you 17 pesos. However, we made a total of 5 calls where we got to speak to someone back in England, but must have made 20-30 other abortive calls which failed for all kinds of reasons, however, the hotel still charged 17 pesos for each of these. I was confronted with a bill of 577 pesos when I checked out. I eventually paid 50 pesos after a 40 minute argument. Other people had the same problem. BE AWARE !!

Was told after checking in that the beach was closed and would open on the 26th. Since this was the main reason for traveling here, it was somewhat upsetting. However, we figured we could keep ourselves busy with outside trips and the pool for those few days. The 26th came and went and the beach did not open. The front end loader was still there, the huge sewer type pipes where still there, and it didn't look any different. We were now told it could be the 28th or perhaps the 30th. Since their solution of going to the neighboring hotel beach that was about a 20 minute walk, with no where to sit, and people from 4 hotels using all the facilities, or going to a public beach with extra charges, was not acceptable, we asked to be transferred to a hotel that had an open beach. They did agree, but the only one was the Riu in Cancun. We didn't really want to be in Cancun but had no other option, so took it. They refused to pay the cab fare of $55.00 to transfer and said they had provided us with everything they needed to That the beach belonged to the government and wasn't their problem. My daughter took a loan out to do this trip, so I was not happy with their comments. This trip wasn't cheap and should have been a good memory for her. Along with the beach issue, our maid was horrid. She constantly didn't leave enough towels, no wash cloths, never any shampoo. We had asked for a blanket to two days straight and never got one. Finally I went to the desk AGAIN, and said I was tired of freezing and then I got 4 blankets. Go figure. I don't think the maid ever swept the floor because it always felt gritty. Getting water was another problem. We had to go to the desk and pick it up. Supposedly you had to ask for it in order to have it delivered, but no one told us that. The room was strange too. There was a separate room for the bathroom sink, which lead to two openings, one for the shower and one for the toilet. The toilet room did have a door at least. The sink room had curtains to close, so when you took a shower you needed to close the sink room curtains. Very odd. On the plus side, our location was near the pool and activities and that was nice. The Animation staff was excellent. They had many activities every hour and all day long. They worked very had to make everyone happy (not just the cute chicks). The bartenders were also excellent and friendly. The pools were pretty nice and not too cold. The entertainment was ok. The couple shows we did see before leaving were dancing and lip-syncing to famous movies or stars. They had a small band that played after the shows for about an hour. The disco was at the Tequila across and down the road. The D.J. started out with familiar music, which was great, and then went into the BOOM, BA, BA, BOOM stuff. The walk ways were very tropical, and monkeys and rodents could be seen., Best to wear flat shoes to walk on the cobble stone paths. I would rate this hotel a three.

I guess the hurricanes awhile back took out the sand so slowly the govt is rebuilding it. I totally understand the need for this but WARNING by the hotel would have been nice! FOOD Pro: ... Con: Really bad food! Very disappointed in the selection, quality, flavor etc. The only half edible food was from the \"Steak House\" during the wedding dinner. I am not a picky eater by any means but the Mexican food wasn't even good! I survived on bread with cheese and margarine (no real butter anywhere!) and grilled grouper, which was the only tasty item on the normal buffet. GUESTS Pro: not full of drunken teens or too many young children Con: European & Latin American guests were very rude once they knew you were American. I speak 5 languages and majored in global politics so I am in no way a \"dumb American\" but I was gawked at, cut off, ran into, and generally made to feel inferior. My friend who came with my is a mixed girl (black & white) and she was the only black person at the resort and she was stared at- in a bad way- the whole trip! ROOMS Pro: spacious, all-inclusive mini bar in rooms w/ whole bottles of alcohol, large bed, double sink, huge balcony (we had a suite, not standard room), nice view of gardens Con: Beds were hard, shower/bath didn't drain fast enough when showering so by the time you got out of the shower the water was up to your knees and the next person would have to wait. AC didn't work at all. Toilet backed up constantly and it took the staff hours to come fix it. LOCATION Pro: Playa del Carmen is a great break from Cancun- Coco Bongo night club is AMAZING! DiscoTek at RIU Tequila (across the road from Yucatan) was an awesome time that played tons of American hits. Con: a good 45-50 ride from the hotel. POOL Pro: great water temp and swim up bars Con: You need to get up at 6:00 to get down to the towel check out to reserve a spot by the pool! Anytime after 8:00 will leave you scavenging for a spot down on the beach... which wouldn't be bad if the govt hadn't closed it... SPA Pro: Amazing Swedish massage Con: okay mani/pedi. The mani literally melted off my fingers when I got back to my room (an hour over the paint was applied) and I don't know if it was from the heat or what... and the pedi was nice but I had to lift my foot into the woman's lap- as opposed to sitting in a raised chair like I'm used to in America- and my feet were so soft after it that walking by the pool hurt. In all the trip was a blast, but I think it was from the group I was with and the beautiful location.

Even though the temperature never reached 20C70F they still spent hours in the ocean. Understandably the pool was really cold because of the cold weather. GENERAL RESORT: We stayed on the main floor - no problem with musty smell, yes it is a little humid and the towels only a little bit musty but OMG - you are in a tropical country (if you do not want this go to Arizona for a vacation). The grounds are very clean and staff always pass you by with an Ola! There a monkeys in the trees so watch that you do not hang your clothes on the railings or anywhere close to the railings as monkeys do their \"business\" in the trees and with the gravity and wind.... There are also harmless little ground hog like creatures on the lawns. BEACH: If you do have young children there can be a strong undertow and rough waves so watch them - our boys enjoyed \"body surfing\". The ocean is a beautiful turqoise but not calmThe sand is powdery and white and always cleaned in the mornings - ignorant smokers put out their cigs and leave them there during the day. We were never bothered by locals trying to sell anything on the beach. STAFF: Amazing, always happy and polite. The front desk was extremely helpful and sympathetic for us in a particular situation - Luis Miguel and Rogerios? Quick and efficient. The senoir staff's english is excellent. The entertainment staff are also excellent. Rigobob - high energy kind of guy who ran the games, Emma the head of Children's program. Our favourite was quitet and gentil Jonathan who ran the rifle program - sat hi from Toronto! The entertainment staff work hard and long hours - after working all day they then put on the adult show at 930 pm. Try to catch the Mama Mia, Grease and Michael Jackson. FOOD: Excellente! The buffet had a wide range of foodfs for different styles. My youngest ate pizza every day (what a waste!) and my pre teen tried and ate everything and went for seconds (and he is the thin one!). I do not like fish but ate4 it everyday! If you are in Mexico you need to stray out of your comfort zone and try some of their local food. I also had the guacamoole and their salsa with every meal. We went to the Steak House ( no big deal - very thin steraks) - the steaks at the buffet were better. The Asiaqn was never open. The buffet was excelent so why bother going to the a la cartes.

There was a good variety of food for all meals and the three a la carte restaurants were very good. We normally go out for dinner at least twice on holiday but at the Yucatan there was no need as the food in the Asian, the Mexican and the Steakhouse (my favourite) was top class. By the way, try the fried ice cream in batter at the Asian - excellente!! The pool area was very relaxed and the beach beautiful. Entertainment for kids in the daytime was good and for adults at night, very professional.

I recommend the Mexican Flag and the rainbow =) - The shows every night were great! Excellent performers and beautiful costumes - The hotel was kept immaculately clean the rooms and lobby and beach were just gorgeous. - We fed monkeys right on our blacony TWICE! Keep banana's with you at all times! The resort is filled with wildlife, monkeys and agouti's and cats all over! - For excursions we went on an ATV tour in the mayan jungle and spent a day at Xel-Ha, both were just amazing, I recommend booking through Odyssey tours in Playa Del Carmen its much cheaper and the tour guides are just great! - The sports bar and the disco at the tequila are fantastic, spent many nights here partying it up with other tourists - Get a massage on the beach. It's just incredible. They have magic hands Un-positive: - They don't have many premium liquers at this resort, if you want the good liquer you have to specifically ask for it otherwise they will make your drinks with the cheap stuff - They have wine, but it is terrible. - The food was hit and miss, its better across the street at the Tequila although none of us got sick which is great! - The hotel is listed as a 5 star but is more like a 4 star, rooms are older, not as modern as other resorts, not well stocked with items like towels and toilet paper you have to ask for more, we called for more towels, half an hour later had to go down to the front desk to get them ourselves - The beach gets a little crowded, with so many resorts sharing one beach front it was difficult to find chairs some days but we always managed - The pool is not heated, gets cold but once you are in its nice. - The pool bar at the tequila across the street is better, a little bit bigger Overall it was a fabulous trip!

Weather was not great a mixture of sun, cloud, rain, and cold nights - Fleeces were needed most nights and cardi's some days. Locals say this was not the norm for January - we were just unlucky. First of all the Riu Yucatan. No way is this a 5* (Riu Rating) its barely reaches the 4* Thomson rating. The pluses are the staff who were friendly, polite (despite some guests who weren't) keen and always ready to chat, the bars were well stocked and international brands were available if you asked for them (all at no cost) the Cocktails were extensive but the beer seemed to be watered down. The Minuses- the rooms were a little tired and smelly, not very comfy for a 2 week holiday. The worst part of this hotel was the restaurants. The main restaurant is buffet, the food was ok and varied but became monotonous, It was little better than a canteen, this was mainly due to the dress code not being enforced in my opinion. The speciality restaurants were terrible. We tried the steakhouse/grill and it was awful! Others put us off the the Mexican and the Asian was closed when we tried to book it . Personally we rely on a la carte restaurants to provide some variety and higher class dining when staying at an all inclusive hotel. These provided neither! The pool restaurant was passable for lunch - However, the Riu Playacar up the road was much better. The other problem at this hotel is there is nowhere to sit comfortably nor have a quiet drink. The bar in reception is loud and smokey and the bars by the pool are both next to the entertainment theatre. Theres a beautiful beach and view of Cozumel but no bar or lounge anywhere near it to enjoy it. The entertainment was ok. The staff try hard but it's very amateur and tiresome night after night. They could do with hiring in some decent professional entertainment for a least a few nights a week. Outside the hotel, its 40 minutes walk to Playa Del Carman. 5th Avenue has a good number of shops, restaurants and bars. You have to suffer alot of badgering and negotiate all prices but its ok. We hired a car and went to Tullum, Coba, Cancun, Porta Morello and Porto Aventuras, others went to Chichin Itza and Xcarat. All could be done for a lot less that Thomson prices by using the agents at kiosks down the road in Playacar or in Playa del Carmen. Buses were also cheap and theres a big bus station in Playa Del carmen - Cancun was about 1.5 hours away and cost just a couple of pounds. Oh, yes and take Peso's not dollars! The exchange rate on dollars can be as low a 10pesos to the $ in shops where as in the bank its 13. When we went it was 20pesos to the \u00a3 and generally we found the prices quite good. A bottle of corona \u00a31.25-\u00a31.50 and a good steak \u00a38-10. In my opinion, Playa del Carmen is a nice resort, not too big and you can meet and talk to the locals. Theres lots to do locally and its not hugely built up (yet)! However, I would not recommend the Riu Yucatan. Maybe try a hotel in Playa Del Carman itself. There's a number of new ones being built, it has a nice beach wnd theres plenty of places to eat and drink at hand.", "Date": "January 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA fantastic holiday\u201d", "Author": "Jools300", "ReviewID": "UR53131674", "Content": "We stayed at the Yucatan from the 14th-27th December and had a really good time. A few months ago we stayed at the Xcaret Occidental and chose the Yucatan for this holiday as we wanted a proper beach and to be nearer to Playa del Carmen. We deliberated between the Riu Tequila and the Yucatan and on balance I'm pleased that we chose the Yucatan. We found that the hotel was very clean and the gardens well tended. We thought that the public areas of the Tequila were smarter but for the most part both hotels were very similar. Our room was in the 1 block and looked out onto foliage. We didn't get any noise from the reception area or from the bars near the pool. We did find that the guinea pig like creatures that were abundant in the grounds did like to congregate on the grass below our balcony and it was lovely to watch them trotting about. The howler monkeys seemed spend the mornings nearer to reception and I'm sure must have woken a few people up early as they could get quite loud! Our room was fine. I, like another reviewer, found the matresses quite hard but got used to it after a few nights. I notice that a number of reviewers have complained about a musty smell but we didn't have that problem. The Occidental was much worse for this and I think a lot is due to the positioning of the room and how humid it is during the stay. The food was also better than the Occidental. There was always something good in the main buffet as there was an excellent choice. We did try all three speciality restaurants but only returned to the Asian. We found the steakhouse to be very rushed - we were in and out in about 30 minutes - not bad for four courses!! Plus, the steak wasn't great. The Mexican was the opposite. We were late being seated and it seemed to take forever to get our main courses. The Asian was all buffet and had a good choice of food, though we did like the starter selection best. The biggest drawback to all three is the sitting times. We found the 6:45 too early and the 8:45 was a bit too late if you wanted to see the evening entertainment. We did find that the Tequila was better for breakfast and lunch - at both meals there was much more choice. The beach restaurants were very monotonous for lunch and I felt that they could have put a better variety of dishes out between the two serving areas. The first week we were there, the hotel was fairly quiet but filled up rapidly from the 21st onwards. Sunbeds which had been plentiful became scarce, especially for latecomers. The weather wasn't brilliant for our first week, either. It became quite chilly at times and on the 21st was dreadful - cold and raining. This too could have affected the demand for loungers. One thing we did find worse than our last trip were the mosquitoes. We took three cans of repellant and used every last drop - and still got bitten. Despite there being screens on the balcony door and using a plug in repellant, I believe that we got bitten most overnight. The animacion team were fantastic! For our first few days, we turned down the chance to join in with activities, which we did regret later on. Let me make it clear that once we said no we were never pestered or forced to join in. However, over the course of a few days, we got to know one of the team, Jonathan, and eventually we agreed to take part in rifle shooting. This led to horseshoes, boules, voleyball and darts - and we met some lovely people doing these activites. The winners of each activity was invited to go on stage before the entertainment each evening and receive a prize, which was a nice touch. Another highlight was Rigobob's mulit-lingual bingo! You either love the bloke or hate him but he really is one of a kind! The evening entertainment was so so. We have cruised, so we have seen better but it was ok. We hired a car from the rep in the lobby and found it to be a painless process. We hired a car on our last trip and saw the main sights - Chichen Itza, Tulum, Coba etc and found it really easy to get around - other than to Punto Allen. The road is very poor in places and a normal car struggles with it. This time we hired a Jeep Patriot for the day and had a fantastic trip, seeing Sea Eagles, Turkey Buzzards, herons and loads of other beautiful sights. If you venture that way, make sure that you go into the visitor centre about 6kms into the nature reserve. It has a viewing tower that gives a panoramic view of the lagoon. Just beautiful! Punto Allen itself is very low key and much less touristy than we'd expected. We found a lovely place on the beach (the Cuzan) to have lunch, which was very tasty. One word of warning for those hiring a car. On our last trip we stopped to get fuel at a service station on the main road to Tulum. As soon as we pulled up at the pump, the car was surrounded by attendants who started re-fuelling immediately. They then presented us with a bill for 450 pesos. It was obvious to us that the counter hadn't been zeroed and we were being ripped off - it was a physical impossibility to get the amount of litres they said into the tank of the car, even if it had been empty. The actual bill - when I forced them to go get the official receipt from the cashier - was about 200 pesos. We did not have any problems with either of the two stations we used just off the main road in Playa del Carmen, so perhaps this happens more often at the motorway service stations? As I mentioned earlier, we met some lovely people and have made some good friends. The bar staff were fantastic and special mention must go to Benito and his team in the lobby bar, who put up with us til the early hours on a number of occasions. The bar tender would often anticipate your order and have a new one waiting. We never had to wait more than a couple of minutes to be served, even in busy times. I think that opinions of this hotel vary, depending on how much was paid for the holiday. We got a really good deal for our two weeks and thought it fantastic value. We met a couple who paid 33% more for a week, than we had for two. We went with a realistic idea of what four star (as advertised in our brochure, not by the hotel) meant in Mexico and got what we expected. Other's, especially those who had paid a lot more, had expectations of a Sandals type resort. They were disappointed. Would we go back again? Definitely. Would we recommend it to friends? Only if we thought that it would suit them.

The Positives: The grounds were well kept and clean. The food in the main buffet was very good and we ate there often. The hotel put on an amazing spread of food for Christmas Eve and New Years Eve; all delicious!. Had the opportunity to eat at the specialty restaurants (Asian, Mexican and Steak House). The Asian was excellent, however we did not enjoy the Mexican or the Steakhouse and did not go back. If you did not book the specialty restaurants by 8:00 am you did not get a reservation. The hotel staff throughout the resort work very hard and were very friendly and helpful. The Entertainment Staff were great with hotel guests and kept guest busy and entertained. Not only did they work during the day, they returned in the evening to entertain a the evening shows. As we had 4 little children (5, 7 and 10), kids club was a great distraction and entertaining for the kids. Emma was great with the kids and worked very hard to keep them entertained. The beach was beautiful but very, very busy as the other 2 Riu Hotels did not have beach access and guests had to come over to the Riu. Yucatan and again if you did not get to the beach early, you did not get a beach chair. There is also no shade on the beach but definitely beautiful. The location of the hotel to Playa Del Carmen was great as it was only a $5US into Playa; lots of shopping, entertainment and good food. The resort had monkeys, lots of birds and another little critters that looked like a large rodent or a cross between a rabbit and a rate with no tail. The resort was full of them. Very timid animal. Negatives: The rooms are in dire need of upgrading and what was \"disgusting\" was the smell in the rooms we were in. The rooms spelled very musty and mouldy and not fresh at all. The towels in the room smelled musty and mouldy too. Our AC broke down the 1st week and although the front desk was advised, no one came to fix it. There was a fan in the room but when you turned it on, the smell just got worse. These rooms are used for smokers and non-smokers so if you asked for a non-smoking room, I don't believe there are any sections of the hotel room that are non-smoking. The housekeeping staff did a good job of cleaning the rooms but there was nothing that could disguise the smell. Every piece of clothing in our suit cases has to be either washed or dry cleaned because of the smell. If you are a non smoker or allergic to smoke, there is no where to go as many guests that we saw smoked anywhere and everywhere and it was everywhere in the hotel. Did not see any bugs, but lots and lots of mosquitos. Brought plenty of spray with us, but nothing seem to work and I ended up having an allergic reaction to the critters. Be aware of them as they are bad. The hotel has free internet if you bring your own laptop but you can only get reception in the lobby; if you use hotel computers, you are charged for usage. I would not recommend this hotel to our friends unless they upgraded the rooms as we have stayed at other hotels near the beach and did not stay in rooms that smelled like mould......just think you are breathing that in too! All in all a great holiday with family, but I would definitely call this hotel a 5 star compared to other resorts visited in Mexico with a lower star rating. One word of advice when you are at the airport checking in to get home and they want to charge you for your bags being overweight, especially if you did not purchase a whole lot or the bags were the same weight when you departed from your home. Our son was asked to pay $180US dollars for their bags being overweight and when he asked them for a receipt, they then said they made a mistake; they were going to rip him off and pocket the money.

So if that is what your are use to, maybe youll be disappointed. We are use to this class of resort and thought it was absolutely great! Sure, the food could be better, but it is not horrible. Everyone should have no problem finding something to eat at any time of day. You may have to try many different foods, but then again thats part of going to any buffet. I will say that the barcello had a little better tasting food, but was also more expensive. As far as the resort: The grounds are very scenic and well maintained. The rooms are comfortable. Some say they had a bad smell, but we did not. You are in the jungle, so it is humid. We also didnt have problems with bugs. Just be smart and have a little bug spray with just incase. Room was also clean and the air worked. The monkeys were great entertainment for us every single day!!! We watched them for hours and feed them. We were told not too and didnt listen. It could be dangerous, I suppose, but we did not have a problem. We have videos of 10 monkeys all coming down the trees to get the bananas out of our hands. (They were very gentle, I even let one of the baby monkeys grab my finger with his hand. His hand felt kinda soft. Again, probably not a smart thing to do, but it was just to tempting not to feed them) Staff was so overly friendly I almost felt bad for making them wait on us. (ha ha) They were all so nice!!!! We even went into certain sections of the buffet to get a couple waiters that we thought we so nice. Bartenders too. A lot of the vacationers from other contries were very very rude to other guests as well as the staff. That was hard for us to sit and watch. And my wife did not like the topless women on the beach. The beach: Water was very very pretty. The sand was pretty, but was hard to walk on because the beach had a good slant to it for a good portion and if you wanted to walk on the flat it was in the very soft sand. The next day our caves were so sore we could hardly walk and meet several others with same experience. The sand whales as most people call the sand bags are all over. But for us didnt really matter.

We didn't complain about them as it's difficult to imagine how they could have resolved the problem and we did get used to them after a few nights. The bar staff are so friendly it's unbelievable.

The food in the buffet restaurant was really good, so good that the al a cartes did not compare. We went to the Asian twice, the steak once, but preferred the buffet. The steak house was in fact disappointing. The hotel made a great effort in decorating the hotel for christmas, it even had its own little grotto...

Everywhere is very clean tidy friendly an safe!! with so much to do an see, with beautiful beaches an some amazing places to snorkel. The hotel was fabulous!! food was amazing!! could not resist any of it. So much choice everyday!! an never repeated!! Smoked salmon at breakfast was a treat!! You have to look around, as I had some salmon one day that my husband didn't see. Anyone who thinks the food is not good..... must live in a palace!! Pool was clean an tidy but not heated. Still a welcome break when the sun was soo hot!! The beach was beautiful!! The sand bags arent a problem they need to be there, as some days the sea is very rough!! We took some bread down to the sea an you can feed the fish, the kids loved it. Met a Scottish couple just as we had got off the plane at Manchester, who stayed in Playercarmen, who had also heard the Riu Yucatan was good, so recommended to them as well. (hope they read this too as they were lovely an friendly!!). We did the Xcaret trip its $69 to get in an the reps charge the same. Was ok an took a whole day to go round, the beach there was really pretty an the beer was good. But when I go back to Mexico, I wont be doing Xcaret again as you can get a taxi to Peuto Aventuras (170 peso or $17 ) an its a beautiful marina with cafes an bars all the way around. And you are sat right by the dolphins!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This was amazing!! They also have Mantani's an sea lions. An all of this is free of charge! Beautiful to walk around the marina. There are loads of colourful fish in the water to look at. We saw 2 huge sting rays. We hired a fishing boat for 4 hours this cost $250 between a family of 4, was ok. We also did the Catermaran, which sailed from Puerto Adventuras. We preferred to pay direct an get a taxi to the marina so it cost us $80 per adult. We had to ring up 1st tho an we did this with the catermaran called Cata maya. We also went over to Cozumel which was well worth a visit!! we hired a car. Beware they are not safety concious. No seat belts in back for kids!! but its very safe slow driving over there an the island is def worth a visit an a drive around. We met a lovely couple with 2 kids, Emily an Harry, from nr Newcastle. My little boy Harry an this other Harry got on lovely. But unfortunately my Harry was asleep on the last night to say goodbye!! so hope they read this also! as Harry loved spending time with Harry!! If anyone would like any further info do not hesitate to contact me.

The rooms are split into 3 storey blocks, there are no lifts but this isnt a great problem as your luggage is bought to you room and if you have difficulties just specify that you require a ground floor room. The rooms had 2 very comfortable double beds in which had a memory foam topper, tv, bedside cabinets, hair dryer, stocked fridge of soft drinks and beer, sink, toilet and shower. The optics are also in the bathroom, rum, tequila, gin and vodka - be warned the vodka is like fire water but never stopped us getting through a couple of bottles!! The maids always kept the rooms spotless and we had towel art left on our bed which is great to see. The restaurants are fantastic, clean, tidy and all food cooked to high standards and very fresh. For those who say there isnt much choice I dont understand there was more than enough choice and something to suit everyone! The waiters and waitresses work extremely hard and nothing is too much trouble for them. In the main restaurants there are features carved into large water melons which look absolutely fantastic and in the evenings ice sculptures. The entertainment team are brilliant - there are various activities that take place during the day from aqua aerobics, volley ball, towel modelling, water melon sculpting, yoga, bingo and much more, if you dont want to join in there is absolutely no pressure. In the evenings the team put on a show which alot of hard work goes into, the dancing is fantastic. To name a few of them Lester, Jonathan and Juan Carlos, always very friendly and a great laugh! The bar staff also work extremely hard and always remember your order, and you are served pretty quickly. Israel and Ishmel are legends. If you go our partying Ishmel who works being the bar in reception keep a stash of sarnies, usually cheese and ham, which at 5am were more than welcome, washed down with a pina colada!! The beach is totally gorgeous, yes there are sand whales but they are not an eyesore but they are slippery and we did see people slipping on them, but they are wet with sea water so I guess it would be common sense not to go walking over them as that is what causes them to be slippery. You dont need to reserve a bed on the beach as there are more than enough beds throughout the day. We never sat round or used the pool and the beach was too gorgeous to tear ourselves away from but I think you would have to put your towels down there to get a bed. There are shops around the resort which have everything you need and is totally safe -- there is even a starbucks 5 mins down the road which was very nice and some lovely souvenier and some really nice silver shops. You can also use the other Riu hotels in the complex which we had a look round and were glad that we had picked the Yucatan, altho they were all nice in their own way. The only problem was the mosquitos - i took antihistamines and vit b tablets with yeast for a week and the whole 2 weeks we were there as Im prone to being bitten, we had also ordered the Lifesystems insect repellent for our skin but the blighters still bit us, From the shop in reception you can buy a local repellent called Off - which smells like strawberries and seemed to help quite a bit - but be warned if you miss a patch the midges will find it!! We also had a mossie plug on in the room which my friend brought with her and i recommend getting one. There are animals in the grounds of the hotels we saw the monkeys in the last part of our hol towards the wooded bridge part - keep your eyes peeled for them. No animals come close or are a problem whatsoever. We did the dolphin excursion and can recommend it - its a great experience, We flew with Thomson from Gatwick and the flight was fine - we upgraded to premium and were glad we did. We were well looked after and the time went quickly. Be sure to wrap up warm for the flight home as it does get quite chilly. All in all a fantastic holiday and I would recommend it to anyone.

We were very lucky as had two weeks of sunshine which I know wasn't the case before we arrived. The hotel is fantastic, I thought the rooms although basic in their furnishings were spotless with comfortable beds and a fantastic shower. The maids cleaned the rooms every day and a small tip of $1 meant nice extra's. The fridge was restocked every two days with water soft drinks and beer and although we didn't indulge there were spirits in the room. We took a plug in mosquito killer and some coils for outside on the balcony, and that was fine. Obviously expect a few mossies in a tropical climate but we used jungle formula spray every night and were not really bitten. The pool area and beach were fantastic, I thought the pool was very clean, despite some earlier bad reviews on here and the beach was beautiful, the RIU definitely has the nicest beach as further up the coast they has had to be a lot of sand whales put in place to stop further erosion. If you walk south along the beach for about 10 mins you come to the end of the hotels and the beach is unspoilt with jungle right to the sand. We got some lovely photo's here. There were loads of sun loungers available both in the sun and shade, and of course you can move them. People were up early I think due to the time difference but we never had a problem even when returning from trips in the afternoon. the entertainment was good and you can choose to get involved or not, I did water aerobics a couple of days and my boyfriend played volleyball. We really enjoyed the use of the free catermarans, and also went out on a jet ski. We dived with Scuba Caribe both on ocean dives and the cenotes and they were very good with small dive group sizes. we priced them up vs operators in playa del carmen and they were about the same price if you took into account having to get a taxi into playa and also the convenience of having them right on the hotel. They only Thomson trip we did was the Coco Bongo's trip in cancun it was very good. We got the Chitzen Itza trip with magic tours in playa which was $45 vs the $99 you would have to pay with Thomsons, also we did it on a 12 seater mini bus vs a huge coach which was much better. I swam with dolphins at puerta aventuras which was fantastic, and we also hired a car for $50 and drove to Coba and Tulum. It is only 51 peso's into Coba so this worked out much cheaper and the roads are fine to drive on. Finally the food- We thought this was fantastic, there was so much choice on the main buffet we were never bored of it and I actaully thought for an AI 4* that it was really good quality. there was plenty of fruit, freshly made juices for breakfast as well as all the cooked stuff you would expect. the pancakes were really nice. Lunch was really nice, we did eat for the first few days at the beach restaurant but then started to go up the main restauarnt as it was a bit cooler and there was more choice. We tried all of the speciality restaurants and went to the mexican twice, we liked the staek house the best though and went twice. We spoke to lots of people on the holiday who thought the food was good. The drinks were really nice as well and I loved the pina colada's All in all a fantastic time, we met different nationalities, had lots of fun and a holiday is what you make it.", "Date": "November 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridgeshire", "Title": "\u201cSenior Blanco (Mr White)\u201d", "Author": "SeniorBlanco", "ReviewID": "UR49897997", "Content": "Hello there!

This was our first ever time at an all-inclusive resort and we were slightly apprehensive about what to expect, especially as there are a few bad reviews on this site. All I can say is that those who give bad reviews are either miseries or moaners or they've had a bad holiday for some other reason and are blaming it on the hotel rather than taking responsibility themselves! Everything about the Riu Yucatan is muy excellente! The rooms are big, clean, comfortable with well-stocked mini-bar and fridge and mercifully have very good air-conditioning. The staff are the most friendly and attentive of anywhere we've ever visited. Particular favourites are los dos Heribertos, Elsa, Marin and Henry. We started to look forward to seeing them at mealtimes. The food was superb - breakfast was our favourite buffet. There was plenty of choice to have something different every day over the 2 weeks we were there. The most basic food was at the beach restaurants. We went to each of the A La Carte restaurants - favourite was Asian, then the steak house and lastly the Mexican (as it seemed very salty). The pool was huge - my only concern about the pool area was that people tended to stay at the swim-up bar for a looong time without appearing to get out to use the loos! I preferred swimming in the sea, which was the most amazing clear, blue, warm water. The waves got a little hairy at times but there was a life guard there to call people out of the water when they became dangerous. The beach was fabulous - I'd read a lot about the erosion and the fact that the beach can sometimes become much diminished with a steep drop-off, but at the moment it is perfect - an expanse of beautiful white sand that is looked after continuously by Riu staff. The Animacion team were very hard-working and seemed like a lot of fun. However, this type of entertainment wasn't our cup of tea but we were never hassled to join in. Our youngest son loved the mini-club and nightly mini-club disco though. Despite having planned for this trip for months before and having read up on best places to visit, best deals etc, I still (stupidly) fell for booking a tour to Xel-Ha through the Thompson reps and was shocked at the cost. There are much cheaper legitimate tours which can be booked down at Playacar Plaza (and probably cheaper ones still in town) and I would recommend that you don't book with Thompsons. Be aware also that places like Xcaret and Xel-Ha go on height for admission so we had to pay adult prices for our 11 yr old son, which was something I hadn't planned for and therefore racked the cost of the tours up considerably. We were there during Topical Storm Ida which meant that there was almost a week of rain, sometimes very heavy. Although not ideal, this didn't spoil the holiday at all, although I would've preferred snorkelling at Akumal on a clear day as we didn't get to see any of the famed turtles.

This was the 3rd time I have been to Mexico but the 1st time I have stayed in Playacar. I went with my husband, 3 children aged 2, 5 & 8 & my parents. I would describe the hotel as being pretty average in comparrison to the other places I have stayed in Mexico (the others being the Moon Palace & the Riu Caribe in Cancun). The hotel had an unusually large mix of nationalities ranging from the expected Americans, English & Germans to the Dutch, Spanish & Argentinians. We were on the 2nd of 3 floors which was ok apart from the lack of a lift. As we had a child in a buggy that was a little awkward sometimes. I can't complain though as we were offered to change to a ground floor room if we preffered. The rooms were ok, twin beds & a camp style bed in each one. It did mean that the 2 year old had to sleep between us as she didn't have her own bed. The rooms felt damp - probably due to the humidity & were a little tired in decor. The bathroom only had a shower which again was awkward with small children. The shower & loo really needed replacing as they were a bit ropey. The loo broke a few days into the holiday but was quickly repaired once reception had been notified. I was a bit dissapointed with the view though - no sea or pool views & lots of trees outside balcony so not much to look at. The food was pretty good but as with most all inclusives became boring after 2 weeks. It could have done with more variety. Most lunch times we ate in the beach bar area which always served the same, burgers, sausages, chips, fish, pizza, pasta & rice with melon, jelly & ice-cream for afters!!! For some reason the tables in here were laid out to seat 4 & when we pushed 2 tables together one day as there was 7 of us we got told off!!!!! I was a bit surprised by this as it isn't something which would have been a problem in the other hotels. The Aisian restaurant was nice & worth a visit. The staff were mostly friendly, there were a couple of good waiters in the dining room which if slipped a tip early on made sure the same table was ready for you every day & decorated with flowers. It pays to give a small tip (50 pesos) as it really does make the difference between being served & being well looked after. The glass collecters around the pool quite often seemed to be skiving on the beach & not doing much - in other hotels they would have been taking drinks orders around the pool & bringing drinks to you. The entertainment was very repetative, there were a couple of shows based on Mama Mia & Greece which were ok. The best was a Michael Jackson Tribute which is an act that travels around the Riu Hotels. The entertainment staff were friendly but very self centered. After each show (every night!) there was a big bit at the end dedicated to cheering for them all one by one - you wouldn't get that at a West End Show!! It became tedious to watch. Ema who was in charge of the Mini Club was a lovely girl & my daughters really enjoyed spending time with her. The playground area was a bit hit & miss but it was in the shade & the kids didn't seem to notice!! The pool was ok, not especailly clean but not really dirty. The kids pool was ok for toddlers - only 2ft deep & was seperated from the main pool by a horrible tiled wall which desperately needs repairing. There were quite a lot of sun beds but the same story as in most places - to get a good one you had to be up early. There were loads of beds on the beach but not many in the shade. The beach was lovely, there is plenty of it & sea defences are not as bad as some make out. Midges are a problem, spray doesn't seem to make much difference if you wear it!! They are everywhere and the bites are really itchy. They didn't seem to bite the kids though. The odd monkey made a twice weekly visit to the pool area but didn't stay long - i half wonder if it was an organised thing as lots of people with walkie talkies seemed to be following it along!!!! The hotels on call Dr was efficient & the hospital very clean & friendly!! Make sure you have good insurance as you never know when you may need it - my daughters bill would have been around \u00a3800 without it. Playa Del Carmen was a nice resort - plenty of shops, bars, cafes etc & Senor Frogs is worth a visit if you are up for a laugh. The ferry to Cozumel is easy to arrange & a good day out. I did find that things were massively overpriced in the shops & the trips very expensive in comparrison to other years.It cost me nearly \u00a314.00 for a small pack of nappies & about \u00a34.00 for a tub of Pringles. I would say the lack of tourism this year has really affected the area & accelerated the cost of things enormously. To sum it up - you get what you pay for with this hotel. It isn't the most expensive hotel but i'ts not the cheapest either. If you want luxury & perfection don't stay here go to a more exclusive resort.

It was our first time at a RIU, having favored the Iberostars mainly. We were here with a very large group of 30-35 for a destination wedding (our son), mainly 20-30 years in age with a few of us older ones. We loved the resort mainly because it was the perfect size and easy to walk to the lobby or back to the pool without having to take a tram or pack a day's rations. The wedding was perfect, the attentiveness and details were outstanding. It was beautifully done and the dinner reception with the ocean backdrop was as gorgeous as the bride and groom. Of course, the couple and the attendants themselves made the wedding, but our fantastic memories are so many. People lined up to watch the nuptials. But many people stopped to congratulate them and offer their best wishes, compliments and copies of the pictures they had taken. We met so many wonderful and friendly people and having the right-sized resort made it feel more like a family reunion. You begin to recognize everyone after several days and get to know all the great people from around the world that flew long hours to get there. We made our own entertainment as a group but we did also enjoy the evening shows. The entertainment staff and dancers worked very hard to please. There weren't any audience participation shows that we saw like many of the resorts have, but their were talented dancers. Obama was a very engaging and very dedicated behind the scenes person who quickly became my favorite. He lacked the self-absorption of a few but yet was humbly responsible for much. We loved Obama, Lester, Christian, Jonathon and yes, even over-the-top Rigo Bob (oh MY God!) to name a few. The bartenders were hard-working and friendly and always had a smile while even wearing a jacket and tie, specially Eduardo. Drinks were fun (Paradise, Miami Vice), plentiful and tasty. The staff in general was very hard-working and tried to please. The maids were efficient and the room always stocked. Every employee smiled and greeted you and made you feel welcome and wanted. We had an incident of the disco being promised for the wedding by someone who said they were in charge(shame on you Elvis and in front of witnesses!), only to find out later he was not and so it was a disappointment. But that was an ego problem of the employee, not the hotel and the fact we did not go to the REAL person in charge led to that dispute. Had we not been misled I am sure it could have been handled in time. The front desk staff, hospitality and managers always aimed to please, even with our rowdy group and we appreciated that. We also had an incident at the Riu Tequila disco with a bartender (who was too overwhelmed to handle that large of a crowd in that very overcrowded disco) so that was disappointing but was limited to that hotel so we just did not go back there. It would have been nice had the Yucatan had their disco open as we were led to believe, so that you didn't have to walk back and forth but maybe they can rectify that for future use. I am sure if they had a younger crowd regularly they will realize that need. We got to use it just one night and it was so much fun! The suite was very roomy and clean. We had requested bed toppers (thanks to a tip from a tripadvisor review) and that made the beds very comfortable. We were up so late enjoying the company, shows and the ocean breezes, we always fell asleep immediately anyway. Although the in-room liquor is nice, it was not needed for us and I would have preferred a coffeemaker instead. First thing in the morning, that would have been so delightful. Any other complaints I had were due to things that could not be changed and most likely found at any of the resorts. As others have said, the mustiness of the towels and room was an inconvenience, but nothing seemed to dry out easily with the humidity. The mosquitoes were the biggest annoyance, and we took 4 cans of spray, returning with none. But we have run into that at all of the resorts we stayed at, Cozumel had the worst. The heat took some getting used to as even though Texas has heat and humidity, this was pretty oppressive. It just made me move at a slower pace, which was okay by me. The lobby had them the most, since there was very little air movement, but if you went down to the beach bars for the show it wasn't bad at all. Plus the breeze and views were so beautiful it was the place to be anyway! We hardly used the pool at all since we can do that anytime at home so the beach was our hangout. The sand was nice and not too hot and the water the perfect temperature. We never had trouble finding a chair and shade if we needed it. The view of Cozumel was incredible and so very relaxing to just watch the waves roll in and out. There was an occasional afternoon shower that was so brief and cooling it was welcome. Having a large group, the buffets made every breakfast, lunch & evening meal easy to handle. Some people went into town and did their own dinner at Parilla or Blue Lobster along with shopping, but the cheap taxi and quick ride made that easy. Even with picky eaters no one went hungry. The size of the resort made it easy to always know where people in the group were and so it was easy to connect. We were grouped closely in several buildings for the rooms which was very handy. With so many arriving and departing at different times and on different days, we had no trouble getting everyone together. It was a very laid-back feel to this resort and different than the younger crowd at the Tequila. This was a perfect fit for our needs and our group. The wildlife watching was so fun. My son and his new bride had a monkey tap on their glass balcony door while they were watching TV and so they went out and played on the balcony with her and fed her fruit. She was a little one who enjoyed the play like a kitten. We have some wonderful pictures of that and memories to go with them. How often does that happen? Several in the group used the spa and beauty services which were all good. Massages were very good and needed. The fitness center was well-stocked for those who were still disciplined enough to use it. I never made it that far myself, I was in a low-key mode and the walking to and from the room to the beach to the buffet was enough for me. After 8 days we reluctantly came home. But I would go back again in a heartbeat and recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet getaway, family gathering or destination wedding.

Now to the good stuff, from the moment we landed we were wellcomed with open arms, when we got to the hotel the staff immediatley greeted us and gave us drinks while introducing us to the hotel. The rooms were great, very cool and spacious plus plenty of drinks in the mini bar which is re-filled every other day but dont be afraid to ask if you need more. The resort its self is very large and other hotels are just minutes away. The pool which i know comes under a lot of critisism is not at all dirty, yea there are a few flies floating about but that cant be helped plus it gets cleaned every day, the beach is amazing and the sea is gorgeous (be sure to take some bread down to the water to feed the fish). Staff are very helpful and couldn't do enough for you, look out for wilbert and almero they are both guaranteed to get ya wasted on boom booms and tequillas, animation team obama, lester, and UH OH rigo (you'll get the gag when ya see him) are all a laugh aswell and put on an amazing show every night, dont know how they do it. Food was very nice plenty of choice, if you want to eat in any of the a la carte restuarants then be sure to book a table at 8.00am or just see wilbert he'll sort ya out. The resort its self is very nice with lots of shops to look around, playa del carmen not that far 5 mins in a taxi, weather was gorgeous very very hot make sure you take high factor sun cream, Biggest problem was the mossies others have said to buy OFF but that didnt work that well either they go for your ankles the most especially during the show so be sure to spray your legs loads but really the only thing you can do is to put up with it n hope you dont get bitten to much. We booked through thomson for the trips which were pricey but well worth it, we did the bar crawl which ended up in coco bongos in cancun BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD!!, chitzin itza the old mayan ruins which was very interesting and the day trip to isla contoy a little island of the coast of cancun which i highly recomend, we started by snorkling and then had a barbecue on the beach, we even got to feed a sting ray which was quite an experience. Night life after the show is great, we went over to the tequilla sports bar a few nights, also lovely hotel.

The bar staff are quality, will make you any drink you want and they aren't shy on the alcohol, so too are the entertainment team, join in some of the activities with Lester and Rigobob during the day.

Not surprised mind, was bloody annoying, 2 beds beside us had towels on them all day and nobody used them, a tub of sunscreen was placed on one after lunch, but no occupant.

Its an hours trip to the hotel which isnt to bad and when we arrived we were quickly checked in and given a lovely welcome drink. We found our rooms which as previously requested were next door to each other and shortly after our luggage was brought by the bell boys. The rooms were comfortable. The shower was great but if you like baths you'll be disappointed as there isnt one. The mini bar was probably one of the best we have had, lovely and cold plus the optics were a bonus. If you wanted ice there are ice trolleys on every floor. Not that this is important but if you just want to relax in the room the tv channels are good. Plently of films and channels for the kids. We sat on the balcony a few times and watched the agouti's. These looked like a cross between a rabbit and a rat. They were friendly and harmless. We often heard the howler monkeys and at one point were able to feed them. The hotel and its grounds were immaculate and the beach was probably the best in the surrounding area. Some of the hotels hardly had any sand in front of them. The food in the hotel was great. Plenty of choice and the al a cartes were good. Our favourite was the mexican but the steak restaurant was a close second with the asian being the least favourite. Not that the food was bad, there was just less choice for the kids. The only bad point I can think of is that you can hardly move around the pool as there are so many beds packed in and the pool itself could do with a bit of an upgrade. When we were there, there was a man chipping away around the pool and the chippings were going in the pool. They should be closing for a few weeks to sort the whole pool out. This was our only disappointment. This hotel is in a really good spot, with Playa Del Carmen just down the road. There are plenty of bars and nice restaurants plus there are some designer shops. Last time we visited mexico we used there bus service which was brilliant. They were grey hound buses and the bus terminal is in Playa Del Carmen. They are really comfortable and cheap. We went to Cancun which took about an hour for \u00a33 each return. This took you to the bus terminal and then we got a taxi to the hotel zone.

Upon arrival we were greeted with a non-alcoholic cocktail and given the low down on the rooms, safes, restaurants etc and given an envelope with our keys to our rooms, then we put stickers on our luggage which was brought up to the rooms very quickly. The rooms are clean, basic, but good size beds and these are cleaned daily. The service we received for the 10 days we were there was absolutely brilliant, and not false, it was friendly, helpful including Wendy the rep there, would loves HP sauce so bring her some over if you are going. The swimming pool area is well kept, although you do have to be up at 6.30 - 7 to get a decent location around pool etc. There is always plenty of sunbeds on the beach, however not always in shade. It was extremley hot whilst we were there and there was no way you could sunbath for the whole day, I think I would have been burnt to a crisp!! Now the mossies....aaaarrrrgggghhhh my only problem....I brought Jungle Formula from Boots in spray, and lotion...thinking I was keeping them at bay, instead I was bitten to pieces...We then spoke to Mayeli who was also working with Thomsons rep Wendy and she advised that this stuff is like sugar to them, and they love it, so if you are going to get a repellent get OFF, its in an orange tin. Drinks by the pool during day are served in plastic cups and the cocktails are great however sugar overload!! Tequila Boom Booms are potent...but very nice....Margaritas excellent... Pools are reasonably clean, although I did think the jacuzzi looked a bit grimey.. They have various activities such as aqua aerobics, bingo, (very funny), target shooting, Spanish lessons. All done with light attitude and you dont have to join in if you dont want to. The team work very hard to put on shows every nite, although a little bit butlins its all good fun and enjoyable. The sea is georgeous, sand whales not a problem one bit, although I would recommend not jumping around on them as they are very slippery. The hotel is situated very close to a small plaza of shops which are in a 5 min walking distance, then if you want to go into Playa Del Carmen its a $5, and that is a fixed price. Thats not bad for 5 min journey. $10 in all. In Playa Del Carmen you will find various shops, bars, restaurants, its great, lots of trinkets, goodies to buy, hair braiding if your into that kind of thing. Few boutiques etc. Food in the restaurants was great, something for everyone, I seriously couldnt understand if someone got bored of the choice. The steak house is absolutely amazing, the Asian ok and the Mexican not the best. If you want to book these restaurants you have to book these when going for the breakfast, the steak house is always booked up first, and usually by 8am. Oh and one more think, excursions are quite expensive, around \u00a350 per person depending on what you are doing. We done the speedboat and sea turtles excursion, this was done with fat cat and was for 8 people, we had family of 4, and just one other family, so was lovely. The other excursion was Tulum Extreme experience, was great, zip lining, Rappeling, and snorkling in cenote, but definately recommended.

Even the gardeners go out of their way to greet you. The welcome that we received was second to none. The food was fantastic, although I would recommend making use of the A La Carte restaurants to break up the routine. The Animacion staff were friendly and very keen. They were not pushy and my daughters had some great times. The evening entertainment was also good, and much of the time the Animacion staff were responsible for this. The Grease and Michael Jackson Shows are a must for those there at that particular time. The beaches were clean and provided some of the best scenery in the entire resort. My daughters threw some bread into the water and watched the fish swoop up out of the water to feed. They will even take food from your hands. Not for the faint hearted though because there can be a huge amount of fish. The rooms were well maintained and 'very' clean. They did smell a little damp, but this was obviously due to the air conditioning. The rooms stayed comfortable despite the high tropical temperatures outside. There is a huge effort made with small detail with this hotel; like the towel folding in the rooms. The grounds are beautiful and home to many animals. The animals are not intrusive and go quietly about their business. The mosquitoes are troublesome, especially after a bit of rain. Make sure that you are well prepared with some jungle formula repellents. All in all a fantastic and good value holiday.

Firstly about the flights - we had 4 hours of TV on the way there & none on the way back - Bravo Thompsons, Premium Economy my bottom ! Now for the holiday. Rooms are nice & clean. Admittedly dated & could do with a repaint but i wasnt overly concerned by that. We were located in 1125 which is inbetween the hotel & the pool & was ideal for us. Also we were on the ground floor, which while not essential, is beneficial when its hot & humid ! Only gripe about the room was the safe that requires a key. A minor inconvenience but still irritating all the same. Resteraunts were all decent enough - Service was adequate aswell. I never got bored of the food - but then again i wasnt one of the people who seemed to eat everything on offer at mealtime. The Mexican was nicer than the asian & steak house, but the others were more than acceptable. One annoying thing is that we had a meal in the Riu Tequila's steak house & it was far superior to our meal in the Yucatan Steakhouse - why service & food should be any different is beyond me? The pools are bath hot, so we never went in them & stayed on the beach. They were however, not the cleanest & several of the kids were dropping down with ear infections - coincidence i think not. IF YOU WANT THE PICK OF YOUR SUN BEDS YOU HAVE TO BE UP AT 6 AM ! We never bothered & went onto the beach about 9ish, but the bed taking was rediculous. People were spending the morning on the beach & then the afternoon round the pool under shaded beds that they had reserved at the crack of dawn. It did annoy me off but not enough top upset my holiday. The beach was lovely & although there wasnt any umbrellas, we were always able to get some shade under neath the palms. There was also a lovely breeze here aswell. The sea was also lovely & the sandbag groines make excellent safe swimming areas. There is a fair old rip tide when you go further outpast them, so unless your a strong swimmer, i would be careful about swimming out. Went out snorkelling when there was a red flag on the beach & the rip was very strong, but if you stay within the bags shelter there is no problem. The activities are fun & frequent with plenty to do if you desire. You dont get hassled to do them either. All the animacion team are nice & friendly. Tried playing beach volleyball & sucked big time. Apologies to everyone who i played with & were generous enough not to shout abuse at me :o) We never had a problem getting a drink - or even a seat at the bars, even though it was apparently full. The bar staff are fantastic & kept me amused thropughout the holiday. Special mention to J Cruz who i missed on my departure as it was his day off. Top bloke who kept me well stocked with Havanah Mojito's constantly. Reception seem to be different to the rest of the hotel. I asked for an extra pillow twice at reception & even had them ring up about it twice more. I saw the customer relations lass & she said she would sort it aswell. 2 weeks later & no extra pillow. Again, not a big deal (wanted it due to a cough i had), but it could have been & should have been rectified immediately. Trip wise, we went to Chichen Itza (long long trip - wish we had done Coba instead this time), swam with Dolphins (excellent) & went snorkelling & saw some turtles. Still loads to do next time we go. Met plenty of other couples from different Riu hotels & they all seemed to prefer ours for the nightlife. The Palaces were not full & apparently had a severe lack of atmosphere. The Tequila was great for the kids as they all just stopped in the sports bar all night long, which left us in peace in the Yucatan. We also had a nice breeze which was lovely. Lastly the hotel felt safe as houses - infact the whole time i was in Mexico felt like that, & i never heard a mention of swine flu, whilst in the UK we were apparently having a 100k people a week getting it. Overall, the hotels nice, the foods nice, the staff are lovely - entertainments not great but after several Mojito's its not that bad. The friends we made over there are more important than a bit of singing/miming & dancing anyway. Its not a 5 star by any stretch, but it does just make the 4 star in my eyes. But it does exacly whats required - a thoroughly enjoyable holiday. And would i go back again - yes i would, which says it aint half bad :o) Oops, nearly forgot to mention the weather & the mossies. Weather was great, we only had a few rain showers which were mostly at night & and 1 afternoon of cloud. The mossies were fairly bad, but we werent bitten at all, once we started using some spray called lifesystems 50+. We used the Boots 50% deet which had some success, but this stuff seemed to do the trick big time.

The hotel is perfect, could not find one fault with it. The rooms are lovely, kept very clean, the grounds are clean and beautiful, the pools are fantastic, beach is wonderful and as for all the staff that work there, well they were brilliant. The entertainment staff all work so so hard and were all so friendly. It was a bit like being at a zoo, if you like animals youn will love this hotel. When we went out onto our balcony, we saw monkeys in the trees opposite, there were these gorgeous, cute little animals that came up to you, looked a bit like big squirrels! We saw Iguanas, lizards, geckos, and an animal that was a bit like a raccoon. The mini bar in room was fab, restocked every day and the cleaner left an animal made from a towel each day on the bed(so clever). We would recommend this hotel to anyone, it great. We are starting to save up now to go back again as it was so good. The Thompsons reps Wendy and maya were lovely, very helpful we miss them both. The only thing was that (my fault) I left my cardigan and my sons Mickey Mouse cardigan (for the plane) in the wardrobe and I have e-mailed the hotel lots of times to see if they could send them back to me, but they have ignored my messages!!!! Overall though, go to this hotel if you are thinking of going to Mexico, the evening entertainment is great, very good for children too, my son loved it, kept him amused all day and evening. Watch out for those mossi's though, I got bitten 30 times on each leg and more on rest of body, even using loads of spray!!

For their benefit I will tell you the good first. It has a great location and the food is some of the best of any AI I have ever stayed at. The lobby is public areas are very pretty and well maintained. The grounds are gorgeous and well maintained. The room was pretty and the beds were relatively comfortable. Thank God the ceiling fan worked well. The water is beautiful as is all of PDC and the *whales* actually make the beach kind of neat. The pool is pretty but very small compared to most AI in the area. It is also hot as bathwater so don't expect refreshment, This is the height of summer so I am sure the pool temp is better in the winter. Now the rest. I reserved 2 rooms well ahead of time and asked to be put on the ground floor for sure because I have a torn meniscus in my right knee and stairs absolutely kill me. I also asked to be as close to the the beach pool as possible, also because of my knee but I emphasized the ground floor above all because I had read there were no elevators. We arrived, we were put on the top floor in the next to the farthest away building from the beach. I asked to be changed. they said maybe tomorrow. After unpacking everything in 2 rooms I did not ask the next day to be moved just decided to live with it. That was until later the next day when the AC decided to only half work. I called front desk and they sent maintainece with a ladder, no tools., He climed up and motioned to me it was blowing, I told him yes but not cold. The room never got below 78 the rest of the time we were there. They would do nothing. There was no water in the room for drinking or brushing your teeth nor any drinks in the refrigerator. I called 7 times over 2 days before they would give us any water of drinks. I also called 4 times about all the ants in our room but they never did anything about that either. We started noticing that the resort definately did not seem full. My daughter speaks relative good spanish so she asked 3 different maids in 3 buildings close to the beach and pool if they were full. They all said that only about half the rooms were occupied. So I am walking forever and climbing stairs on a knee with a torn meniscus because of lazy reception staff. On day 4 we entered our room and the smell about knocked you down. They had come in an painted the big ceiling piece that you can push out and get up into the AC area. Can you imagine painting in an occupied room? I asked the desk to please send someone to just trade that newly painted ceiling piece with one from another room that had not been painted. No, I could move rooms if I wanted to but they would not exchange a piece with another room that would have taken 3 minutes max. We were leaving in a day and a half and I did not want to pack and unpack. They also said if we moved they would not give us rooms together. I did not want my teens somewhere else in the resort. I wanted to be next to them. There was absolutely no shade on the beach until after 3PM when a few palms provided a little shade. There were plenty of palapas up the beach and down at the next resort but I guess the Yucatan did not. I know you can use the facilites at the next resort down, Beach club but who wants to go to another resort to lay on the beach especially when you already had to walk 12 or 13 minutes to the beach from your room. Would I go back? Maybe if the price was awesome but I would not accept a room and unpack unless I really checked it out and if I they gave me excuses I would go find unsuspecting maids and get the real scoop then use that as amunition. I would also take a portable umbrella with me, if you are a person that cannot take alot of sun. I would take a can of Raid and I would check the operation of the AC immediately upon arrival. Do not unpack and accept the room until you are sure. If possible I would stay at another resort though.

Had an amazing time. We were quite worried about the weather after reading the reports which detailed thunderstroms for the entire week we were away, but had nothing to worry about, the weather was beautiful. The entrance hall is very large, had a great welcome with a non-alcoholic cocktail, shown to our rooms and the luggage was delivered to our doors. Small tips are expected here I think. The rooms could perhaps do with a bit of a revamp however they were comfy enough and always very clean. Clean towels were provided every day. There were 2 queen sized beds, a tv, table and chair inside the room and balcony furniture too. There was a curtain serparating the main bedroom area from the washing/dressing area. Iron and ironing board provided. Safe in the wardrobe which is free. Also in this area was the mini bar!! A fridge which was always full of lager, water, pepsi, 7Up, canada soda, and 4 optics too with vodka, rum, tequila and i think perhaps whiskey? These were also filled up as they were used! Breakfast in the Hacienda is good, lots to choose from although it's the same every morning. On an evening, the food in The Hacienda is fantastic, so much variety, lots of fruit and very tasty desserts! Look out for all of the carved fruit! There are 3 other speciality reasaurants, an Asian cuisine, Mexican and a steak house. Book into these early morning in the Hacienda to avoid disappointment! We ate in the steakhouse on a couple of occasions and had lovely meals, steaks cooked to perfection. Lunch is also available in this resaurant - lots of salad, chips, variety of fish and meats, burgers etc. Also very good. Plenty of bars around the hotel, in reception, in the pools, a few around the pools as well as a self serve area but beware of the wasps!! The barstaff are great and serve you very quickly. The poolsides were clean, however we noticed by the end of our stay, the pools had got quite a lot of bits in them, especially the pool bar as people sit in there smoking. You are given a card which you exchange for clean beach towels each day, or as often as you want, so need need to take your own. People tend to reserve the sunbeds, around the pool I think this was a bit of a problem, however on the beach there was pretty much always sunbeds available, however if you want a spot in the shade, get there early under the trees! There was a really nice breeze all week so that stopped us getting too hot. Beautiful beach, some people moaned that the sand whales ruined the outlook, however were installed after the hurricane in 2005 - the beach was washed away so sand has had to be pumped back out to create the beach and the sandwhales stop to tide dragging it away. Don't stand on these, very slippy and dangerous, saw a few people have accidents while walking or running across them. Snorkelling equipment, kayaks, catamarans, boogey boards etc are all available to take out for free, and you can also pay to hire a jet ski, go scuba diving, parasailing etc. Enertainment team are good, if you don't want to take part then that's fine, however you often have more fun than you'd expect!! They're all very friendly and are good to have a chat with, get to know a bit more about the area. Evening entertainment was very good, I especailly enjoyed the Michael Jackson show and also a show about the ancient Mexicans which was really good! Some nights there are a few stalls set up around the entertainment and bar areas. Definately barter with these people for a better deal, offer them about half of what they ask for and then expect to go up just a little bit more. Things like musical instruments etc can be bought in the shops 5 minutes down the road at the plaza for a fraction of the price as i found out!! There are several other Riu hotels around the resort that you can use, the Riu Tequila, Riu Playacar... Riu Tequila has a club which is apparently pretty good although we didn't use it ourselves. We did the river boat safari excursion. Travel to Cancun, you have a speed boat between 2 of you, go out in groups of about 5 boats, follow the guide across the sea and through the mangroves to a reef where you get to go snorkelling for about 45 minutes. Take underwater cameras as there's some amazing fish about - we even saw a ray!! As I mentioned earlier, the weather was fantastic all week - around mid 30s, and very sunny. One day there was a shower and a bit of thunder which passed within about 15 minutes however all night there was flashes of lightening which was really good to watch. This cintinued through the night until about 7.15 in the morning when there was a sudden total torrential downpour which lasted about an hour!! Half an hour after though and you wouldn't have known as it was bright and warm again! Lots of wildlife around the ground of the hotel, look out for the monkeys!! Some funny animals which look a bit like a rat crossed with a guinea pig but quite a lot bigger with longer legs!! (Can't remember their names... begins with an \"s\")! Lots of those about! Also see the odd iguana and also a racoony type animal! Watch out for the mosquitos, I got quite a few bites this year, even though I never normally suffer and have managed to accumulate a few more since arriving home too!! I think that is about all... We travelled with Thomson and Wendy and Myeli, the reps, were really friendly and really helpful when we needed them. All of the staff at the hotel are willing to do anything to keep you happy and make your stay as comfortable as possible so if you do have any problems or need anything in your room etc just ask them!!

I have always been of the opinion that there are too many places to visit to return somewhere for a second time but this place is the exception. I will get the negatives out of the way first. Yes there were lots of mossies this year - more than last I would say but have holidayed in many other places and had to suffer the little so and so's but go prepared with sprays etc and its not all that bad. Rooms are a little tired but are kept spotlessly clean and towels replaced daily. Because of the high humidity levels, there is a slight musty smell to the towels but it is not unbearable and as you are showering regularly and are given clean towels daily it is not too bad. It would be nice to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room. We took a little travel kettle (took an age to boil) and tea bags but should have taken some little cartons of long life milk as we struggled to get some milk early in the morning before the restaurant opened. Edge of the pool could have been kept a little tidier. The problem with people reserving sunbeds is an issue but one for the hotel to sort out. Now the positives!! The atmosphere at the hotel is brilliant. The staff are so lovely and friendly and genuinely can't do enough for you. The animation team are great fun and get the balance just right. Their are activities each morning between about 10am and noon then again from about 3pm to 4.30. My son and daughter loved playing water polo everyday and made friends of all different nationalities. I did aqua aerobics a couple of times which was good fun. My husband did the rifle shooting and was just as hopeless as last year!!! The beach is paradise. Beautiful picture postcard white sand, palm trees and turquoise sea. Lots of water sports - children took out jet skis, we went parasailing, kayaking, windsurfing. My husband did his PADI diving course and my son and I learnt to sail the catamaran which was great. Evening entertainment very good. If you want a change though, you are free to use some of the other Riu hotels and there is also the town of Playa del Carmen a short taxi ride away which is really nice to wander around. Once the children, 18 and 16 hooked up with some other teenagers, they all went across to the Riu Tequila hotel which had a sports bar and a nightclub. We did a few trips last year and this and would strongly recommend Xel-Ha eco park, the dolphin swim and Chichen Itza which although is a long day, is well worth it. You get to see some of the real Mexico on the journey. Coach lovely and cool and cold drinks available as and when you want them and you stop at a beautiful cenote for a swim on route to Chichen Itza. The food in the hotel is of a good standard and although a bit repetitive there is a large choice and perfectly satisfactory and would defy anyone not to find something they liked. Of course there are the speciality restuarants too which are good for a change - we particularly liked the steakhouse and the asian. The majority of people we spoke to last year and this year really liked the hotel and said they would definitely like to return.

The reception desk is great. They explain everythign to you and show you the way to your room. We originally stayed in a standard room. It was on the third floor of building 2. The room was ready for us and very nice. The only problem was the air condition seemed to be just turned on so it was quite hot. More on that later. We ate at the dinner buffet on the first night. The food and service were both spectacular! We then went to the Tequila bar by the pool and spent the night laughing and joking with the bar tenders. They made us several drinks that we had never had. We had a great time. They recommend just about anything with tequlia of course! We went back to our room that night and it was still about 85 degrees F in the room. This made it extremely uncomfortable to sleep, but as we had a little too much to drink, we just went to sleep. The following day we sat on the beech most of the day. We wanted to go in the pool but the sludge of sun tan lotion, cigarette butts, and spill drinks that were floating on top turned us off. I would recommend you stay way from the pools unless you dont mind swimming in sludge. The ocean on the other hand, was gorgeous. The sand whales are actually quite fun to climp on and jump off. There is free snorkal rental on the beach, and you will see many fish swimming near the sand whales. The sand is white, and stays cool. My only complaint on the beach is the cigarette butts that are literally everywere. Its like a giant ash tray. My wife an I are from Ohio were smking is banned in most public areas so it was quite an adjustment for us. Just a heads up to any non smokers, there are a lot of europeans at this resort, and they love to smoke. They dont really car if you like it or not either. They will blow it right in your face. If you are an American, and want to stay somewere that you can meet other Americans, stay away from this resort. There was 1 other American couple there during our stay. We enjoyed it because the idea was to get away, but some may not. On wednesday we went to wet n wild in Cancun. We only wanted to do the swim with dolphin activities, but everything is bundled in mexico as a package so you get stuck with both. That was a great time tho and we had the van pick us up early. The driver got lost on our way back to the hotel and it took almost 2 hours to get back. That night we finally got sick of complaining about our crappy air conditioning and requested a new room at the front desk. We had complained 4 times and they just kept telling us they would look at it. No one ever came. They offered us dinner at the Palace down the street, but dudnt fix our air. We declined and requested a new room. They gave us two room keys so we could pick the room we wanted. The first room was just as hot as our original room. The second room was ice cold and perfect, except for the ceiling leaking and the shower torn apart!!! I guess we werent supposed to use the shower? We took both key back and told them about the rooms. They then had Octavious walk us to a sweet. It was nice, not necissary tho. We only wanted a room that we could sleep in without sweating. The air condition in this sweet was a little cooler than our first room so we took it. It was still around 80 degree F with the air on full blast. He then wanted us to give him a tip for giving us this sweet. I told him if thats how its going to be, dont bother and just give us a normal room with working air. He changed his mind and left us to the new room. One thing you will learn about Mexico is, they expect a tip for anything. Even talking to you it seems. That night we ate at the Asian buffet. It was ok, nothing to rave about tho. You have to wear pants and shirt with a collar to the specialty dinners. Just an FYI there is no air conditioning in these restaurants so be prepaired to sweat while you eat. The lunch buffet is nasty and gets old after the first few days. How many times can you eat hot dogs, hamburgers, or a sorry excuse for pizza in a week? The bast part of the luch buffet was the soft serve ice cream. The dinner buffet get repetative as well, tho they do change it up a little bit. Finally, when they say dont drink the tap water in mexico, they mean dont eat the ice, or touch andything that tap water touches either. Both the wife and I were on the toilet multiple times in a day by the 4th day of our trip. A week later, We are still sick. We drank bottled water only, but I guess they make the ice from tap water. If you drink any of the frozen drinks that are made with this ice = mexicraps for a week. Overall, this hotel is fun, but not the best. Next time we will try one of the nicer hotels in the area. Both of the Riu Palaces look very nice. For the price difference, I would recommend you avoid the yucatan and enjoy a nice stay at one of the places.

We were all eaten alive and this gets you down especially when it is happening day and night and ruins the holiday experience. We even resorted to spraying around the door frame at night as well as the\u2019 Jungle\u2019 plug-in repellent, this did seem to reduce the number of bites when sleeping. The weather was very hot and on some days very humid. It rain twice and this was during the night. Some days were cloudy but it was a relief to get some cooler days. Rooms were basic but thoroughly cleaned daily; the mini bar was always stocked with soft drinks and bottles of beer every two days. Optics dispensers were in the room containing Rum, Vodka, Gin and Tequila and bottles replaced when empty. On arrival at the hotel a refreshing non-alcoholic cocktail was served while we checked in. The reception staff explained all about the hotel. The reception staff are very throughout and on our first night a phone call was received checking that very thing was okay. We had a few minor issues which we reported to reception and they were dealt with promptly. Don\u2019t be afraid to raise problems with reception they are only too pleased to sort it out. The hotel gives a very competitive rate for exchanging currency and we used them for all money exchanges. The food was excellent and very nice and there was always plenty of choice. On top of this there are 3 other restaurants Asian, Mexicana nd the steak house which need to be booked in advance. The Asian is very nice, steak house food is very nice but be warned the mossies will eat you here and the Mexican is nice food but is not traditional Mexican food. There is not much shade on the beach and you will need to get up early if you want sun lougers in the shade around the pool. It seemed that everybody gets up at the crack of dawn and put towels on the loungers and then they go back to bed, reappearing around 11am. This was very annoying. The animation team work hard throughout the day and at night, putting on a evening show, Michael Jackson and Grease they were very good. We did a few trips which were booked through Thomson and we felt were expensive, Captin Hook was very cheesy but the food was the best we had in Mexico, F1 day out involved going on a very fast speed boat, snorkelling on a reef, lunch followed by quad bikes. If you have a bad back then the speed boat will not be for you it really throws you about. Swimming with whale sharks was brilliant we were very lucky on the day we went with 60 whale sharks being in the water, this was a very expensive trip but was very enjoyable and very frightening at first when you see a whale shark swimming towards you with its mouth open. We booked the chichen itza trip at the kiosk in the plaza which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel, it was half the Thomson price and was very well organised, be warned it is a 3 hour coach trip and it is very hot and very humid when you get there.

Furthermore, and from past experience, I didn't also want to finish the holiday with a massive extras bill in respect of drinks etc., so the all inclusive option for us was a must. In that respect we probably achieved what we'd been looking for, they had their space, and we had ours................or so we'd hoped if we were prepared to venture out at some unearthly hour of the dawn to place our towel on a sunbed in order to reserve it. Frankly, I go on holiday to relax and cannot bring myself to have to get into this ridiculous routine. The resort information and various signs around the pool states that this practice is not tolerated by the hotel management, yet I saw no evidence of that rule being exercised by them, as I understand it is in the neighbouring RIU hotels. There are plenty of sunbeds on the beach as an alternative, complete with welcoming onshore breeze, but no parasols and just a few with natural palm tree shade, so unless you want full sun, be prepared to get up early and make your reservation in the customary way, or keep a close eye on those \"reserved\" sunbeds that don't get utilised until much later in the day and claim squatters rights, as regretably it was apparent that a number were \"reserved\" each morning and not taken up until the afternoon when the intended users had tired of the beach and wanted to relax in the shade, having had their cake, they clearly now wanted to eat it ! Bar service was good and fast with self service options too, and food was available in abundance throughout the day with a fair choice of options to enable you to vary your intake as you wished at all mealtimes and beyond, with alternative themed restaurants on site which could be booked for dinner with the restaurant receptionist at breakfast each morning. The rooms albeit a little tired now, were sufficeintly well appointed, spacoius, clean and serviceable, but do exercise caution as mosquitoes are rife, especially if you leave any of the room doors open for any length of time, and unless you want to spend your leisure time swatting flies, I'd suggest you take a couple of anti-mossie plug ins for each bedroom/bathroom area, along with a high concentration DEET spray for your limbs, to protect against the obvious ones you'll find in the evenings, but especially those that seemed to lurk under the tablecloths in the dining rooms, an appropriate place I suppose for them to get their nosebag too. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and attentive and constantly seeking feedback to ensure that as guests we were happy, and was there more that they could do for us. The Thomson staff too were very helpful and Wendy did a great job in comprehensively describing the various trips avaiable for booking, a result of which we enjoyed our trip to Chichen Itza with a refreshing Cenote swim nearby, all under the very knowledgeable guidance of Serge. Xel-Ha is also to be recommended, and we had a fantastic half day trip on a RIB with FatCats to Akumel where we snorkelled for a good hour or so and saw turtles, stingray, barracuda and countless other reef fish and plantlife, which then inspired to me to take a PADI diving course with Gustavo and the brilliant team that run Scuba Caribe at their dive centre at the RIU Yucatan. In all we had a great holiday, striking the balance overall of what we'd hoped to have achieved in a family seeking a mix of wants, but next time we'd possibly choose somewhere a bit quieter where sunbeds and some shade were more readily available, however if my daughters were asked the question, they'd no doubt wish to return chanting the word we all were repeatedly encouraged to spout by RIU's answer to RedCoats..............Excellente!", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cHonestly fantastic\u201d", "Author": "anon063", "ReviewID": "UR36132775", "Content": "AWESOME location, food and hotel.

So much to do- take extra money for trips as there is something for everyone! But also so many beaches, pools and walks if you cant afford the trips. Also def 2 weeks needed- its too far to go for one week and you'd be going home just as you got settled! So clean and friendly and not shabby- gardens attended everyday and little statues/ fences painted fresh at least once a week Just a little note though to say if money is no object the 2 Riu Palace hotels in Playa Carmen were just incredibly indulgent and I think you would struggle to find better hotels in Mexico.

My wife and I ran every morning through the Playacar area, we felt safe and found the little gated community to be pleasant to walk through, even in the evening. We walked to Playa Del Carmen a few times (about 20 minutes). Also, while walking we found that there was a bird sanctuary/zoo nearby. Along the same walk, there are several places for pretty interesting Mayan ruins. We spent a few hours one day exploring them. We did have a chance to walk on the property next door. It was an Ibarastar. It was incredible to see all the wildlife, streams and waterfalls. It looked fantastic. Next time we may try them. The children and I loved trying to find the Howling Monkeys every day. They were great to see. One night they were right out our window in the treetops. Again, this was a memorable moment for the kids. The shows were..., well, they were shows at an all inclusive resort, campy, chessy but entertaining with a few drinks.

None of the repellents worked and we even bought patches from the rep which still didn't keep them away - last resort was rubbing tequila on our legs which one of the entertainment team recommended (they may have been taking the mickey but we would have tried anything) and that didn't keep them away either. The rep said they were spraying daily but we don't think they were. Apart from the mossies we had a really good holiday, the staff at the hotel could not do enough for you, the entertainment team were great and didn't push you to join in, if you said no they just walked away and the food was fantastic, the variety was amazing. The rooms were basic but thoroughly cleaned daily, the fridge was always stocked with soft drinks and bottles of beer and there were optics in the room containing rum, vodka, whiskey & brandy. The pools could do with a bit of a refurb and could do with cleaning more throughout the day but the pool bar's and jacuzzi's were great. There is wildlife around the hotel and we had a monkey on our balcony one morning, we were a little wary of him but he just sat there for a while then jumped back into the trees. We did a couple of trips, Captain Hook is a must - very entertaining and good food. F1 was also a good trip which involved going very fast on a speedboat in the sea (don't do it if you have back problems though). Both trips were not particularly cheap but they were good fun.

Starting with the flight (Thomson Birmingham-Cancun) 10 hours is a long long time to be on a plane if you have never flown long haul before and to be honest the food isnt great but i suppose what did i expect it is aeroplane food lol other than that the entertainment is pretty good on board with plenty of new movies and tv progams and games to keep you occupied for a short while at least. Thankfully playacar is only about 50 mins from the airport so at least after all that flying it doesnt take you too long to get to the hotel. The coach is well air-conditioned and you are even offered a Corona for the journey at a small fee lol but fairly cools you down. We arrived at the hotel around 4pm so was still pretty hot but there was a lovely refreshing non-alcoholic cocktail waiting for us on arrival. The reception staff are exceptional throughout your holiday they will phone your room to check you are having a good time and everything is ok. Any problems you have dont be afraid to say as they will soon have it sorted out for you. The rooms are quite basic but very nice at the same time, a massive bed and very very clean with a mini bar that is restocked regularly and a tv with plenty of channels to watch if you want to take a break from the sun for a while. The cleaners/house-keepers are exceptional and we even got left some beautiful towel art everyday (a tip now and then does you justice lol) i have honestly never been in a Cleaner place. Beware of the howler monkeys, thankfully they were only around for the first few days of our trip but on our first morning they woke us up at 6am lol they are pretty cute though. There is plenty of wildlife running around the hotel grounds from massive iguanas to teriyakis, squirrels, monkeys and even cats. So theres always something to see. The food was great, the buffet was really nice although on our last few days i found it got a bit repetitive but i am a really fussy eater. The breakfast was the best to me with pancakes and doughnuts and crispy bacon lol Yum!! Always plenty of choice! The specialty restaurants are nice as well especially the steakhouse, amazing! The pool area and beach was lovely. Id advise you to get up very early if you want a lounger by the pool but failing that there are always plenty on the beach where there is a lovely breeze especially after about 3pm which is nice and cooling. Dont be put off by the sand-bags i still thought the view of the sea was beautiful, those of you who think they spoil the beach are just complaining for the sake of it. Just dont jump off them seen a few peopleget injured trying to do this. There is lots to do on the beach with the scuba caribe guys, non-motorised watersports such as snorkelling, kayakaing and renting out catermerans are all free so gives you something to do if you get bored of sunbathing. We went parasailing which cost $60 per person which is quite expensive but it was amazing to see along the coast and the jungle behind the hotel zone. We also went on a snorkelling trip in the reef which cost $29 quite cheap which was really good as well and we even seen turtles was a nice afternoon out. Also went swimming with dolphins with thomson which was brilliant.. An experience of a lifetime for definite my boyfriend didnt really want to go he was only going because it was a present to me but he ended up loving it as much as i did. There are plenty of trips to do, we just wish we had more time and money to do them all, always something to do not like some places where you cant go outside the hotel zone. Yes be careful like you would anywhere but i always felt safe, especially in the playacar area as security guards patrolled the area including the beach day and night which was good always felt safe. There is a small shopping area called the playa plaza about 5 mins walk from the yucatan which has all you need as far as bank machines, jewellery, souvenir shops, pharmacies etc go! Playa del carmen is also very accessible by taxi plenty to see and do in there as well.. We went to the famous coco bongos with the anamation team from the hotel which was brilliant we paid $50 which included transport to and from the club, entry to the club, drinks all night, reserved seating area with our own waiter..best night out ever for ALL AGES!! its more of a show than a night club its Brilliant!! The anamation team at the hotel are fantastic entertainign everyone day and night, they work so hard, the best shows are michael jackson and grease they were great. Overall the people are great, the country is great, the food is great, theres loads to do, plenty of sun and lots more, These people need more tourists to come back to the country, its their livelihood! I could go on and on but im sure you get the idea, Mexico, playacar is wonderful, amazing all i have for it is compliments, i have honestly never had a holiday like it! As you can see i have very few negative opinions of it. Cant wait to go back again...definitly going to happen, seriously if your considering a holiday here dont even think about it jut go no matter if your a couple like ourselves, a family or an older couple, theres something for everyone dont worry, go and have a great time!

Me and my Boyfriend stayed in the Riu Yucatan from July 2nd- 16th 2009. Arrived just before tea time on the 2nd and were greeted with complimentary drinks (non-alcoholic) were we met out Thomson rep Wendy and the hotels reception manager, Felix. If you have any problems he is great and will have them sorted out for you in no time. The pictures on the internet of the rooms, in my opinion do not do them justice. Yes, they are basic but they are absolutely spotless and the bathroom is spacious. We had a balcony over looking trees and the side of the pool, you could also see the sea as well which was nice. The mini-bar is restocked every other day. The TV in the room has like 40 channels (some in Spanish) ranging from the likes of CSI Miami and two and a half men to great movies. This came in handy if you wanted to take a chill pill before dinner etc. The pool area is gorgeous, during our first week, there was only one pool bar open as it is believed the hotel was only 60% full. However, towards the end of our stay the hotel appeared a lot fuller and both pool bars were open throughout the day. We sat on the beach most days as there is a lovely breeze. I do recommend you put towels down by the pool before 9am but if you want to lay out by the beach there are plenty of sun loungers available all day long. There is entertainment on throughout the day which is good fun, the entertainers are persistent to get you to join in but if you politely say no they will leave you alone. Listen out for Rigobob's EENGLISH ACCENT during Bingo, highly entertaining. The entertainment team all work extremely hard, in between providing you with entertainment during the day they are also practicing for the evening shows. These are all enjoyable, depending on what you are into. Ones to defiantly see are Grease and Michael Jackson. The food in the hotel is really good. The main buffet restaurant has plenty of variety and we did not have a bad meal. We tried both the Mexican and steakhouse restaurant. I highly recommend the steakhouse, it is delicious. If you want to book any of the themed restaurants you need to be up early to get a table as they fill up very quickly. We booked between 7am-7.30am. Tried at 8pm one morning and we were too late. The bar staff are all great crack and a few dollar tip every so often goes along way. I recommend the mango daiquiris, Miami vice or blue ocean cocktails and you must try a shot in the grass (i think) and the tequila boom boom. There is plenty of wildlife around the hotel from itty bitty lizards to huge iguanas. The howler Monkeys woke us up at 6.15am on our first morning, but we didn't see much of them after that. You can often spot them in the trees on the path from the pool area up to the lobby. There are also little rodent animals running about, im not sure what they are called but they are cute. WATCH OUT FOR THE MOSSIS, we got eaten alive. Make sure you take a good repellent and after bite lotion. I would recommend you keep you balcony door closed at all times too. My boyfriend actually took a reaction to two bites on his forehead, which caused his head and eye to all swell up. The pharmacy beside the hotel is great, we paid approx $22 for anti-inflammatory tablets which worked very well. If you need to see the doctor whilst away it costs $100!!! There are many excursions to take depending on what you are interested in, we didn't find the time to do all that we wanted but we did go swimming with the dolphins, which was an amazing experience. It cost $149 p.p and this included the dolphin hug, kiss, dorsal fin ride and foot push as well as some free time. It was defiantly an experience of a life time. Be warned though, the professional pictures are expensive, $15-$20 per picture and $30 dollars for the dvd. It costs $110 for the package (6 pictures and the DVD). We went to the Riu Tequila nightclub on 2 occasions, its good fun and really well air conditioned. Also i would highly advise you visit Coco Bongos nightclub, speak to the entertainment reps as they arrange nights out for the guests. It cost $50 pp and this included transport to the club and back to the hotel, entrance into the club, reserved seating area and an open bar. The shows are fantastic. On the night we attended it was actually my boyfriends birthday and the reps (rigobob and chokolate) arranged for a birthday cake with a flaming shot in it to come out whilst the club played happy birthday. They had it all playing up on the big screen so that everyone could see what was happening. It was a fantastic night and well worth the money!!

Steakhouse came in 2nd and Mexican 3rd. We booked several tours through Isaias of Best Day Travel. He has a desk in the lobby. He was extremely helpuful and well-informed about the different tours and was not pushy at all. He gave us the information and let us decide. We had a scheduling problem with one of the tours, which he went above and beyond to resolve for us.

We've been meaning to write this for some time but....doesn't time fly by. Anyway, we thought we'd now write a quick review on our stay for anyone who is about to go to this great hotel, particularly for their wedding day. We chose this hotel via Thomson which included a wedding package and two week holiday and, considering what you might pay in the UK, we thought it was excellent at just \u00a33500. The idea of getting married abroad was ideal for us as we wanted a 'quiet' wedding just for us both (with a big party for everyone when we got back!). We arrived at the Yucatan not knowing what to expect with the room upgrade that was included and, after my partner had said to a member of staff she did not want to wear the 'all inclusive' wrist band because she was getting married, we were immediately taken to one side whilst the lady on reception (Sarah) took our room key we had just been given and exchanged it for one of the suite room keys. I don't know what others experiences are of this but if you've paid for a wedding package we would suggest that you make it clear when you arrive you're there to get married! This was the only uncertain moment of our time there. The rest of the holiday and wedding went smoothly and was fantastic. We met with the wedding planner a few days before the wedding when she took plenty of time with us choosing what we wanted for the day. The flowers and the wedding helpers arrived on time to help my partner into her dress and, with having the suite, we had plenty of room to get ready without seeing each other (going into the bathroom to use the mirror had to be co-ordinated though). We had explained to the planner that we wanted to meet in the lobby and when we met (tear in my eye) we had time to have some wedding photos taken. We even managed to convince the hotel security to allow us to sit in the coach in the lobby!. Seemed like a nice idea at the time but we would probably not recommend it as it is over 100 years old and there were a few flies in there! After escaping the flies (and the snake at the wedding location in the garden) the ceremony went ahead and was very well organised, with the minister speaking in Spanish followed by an interpreter translating this into English. It seemed to go so quickly and yet a year later is still the most memorable day of our lives. We would like to thank everyone who we met at the Yucatan who helped us to celebrate our big day, including Bev and Ru, Matt and Nicky, the two Thomson reps (Claire (good fun scouser!) and Marie) and a big thank you to Lee, Leanne, and Brooke for making the day that bit more special. Thank you Lee in particular for doing a very professional job of filming our wedding and taking a few more photos of us afterwards. For the rest of the day we were just on a bit of a high, with plenty of champagne, good company, and we enjoyed the meal organised for us in one of the speciality restaurants there and were made to feel a bit more special with our own waiter and table set aside for us. What else can we say. We enjoyed the rest of the holiday. The room itself was very clean, and cleaned daily with plenty of towel art and the mini bar stocked regularly (very important to us!). Staff were always around either taking care of the maintenance of the hotel or looking after guests. The bar staff were amazing, sometimes serving what seemed like 10 people at a time. The entertainment was well organised and.....entertaining. The food was fine, got a bit 'samey' which you'd probably expect going for two weeks, but the speciality restaurants offered a chance for something different, just book early! We managed a few excursions (in between doing other things) which included the speedboat day out around Cancun where you got a speedboat per couple!, and, of course, swimming with dolphins. I'm sure we don't need to say to be careful what you spend when you're there though, which soon mounts up if you want the dvd and photos, but it is generally a one off experience. Overall, it was a fantastic holiday, beautiful hotel, and more importantly a fabulous and memorable wedding day. We would recommend this to anyone considering something similar.", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cIts What You Make of It.\u201d", "Author": "dsenwlyweds", "ReviewID": "UR31573572", "Content": "My husband and I visited the RYP from 5/27/09-6/2/09. I can say that we honestly enjoyed ourselves it was a fun relaxing, and awsome vacation, I had absolutely no complaints what so ever. Room-was exstreamly clean, no dirt anywhere, they take pride in cleaning the resort rooms and it shows, a word of advise though no matter how clean the rooms are you still have to watch out for giant coch roaches. The only complaint I had about the rooms is, my husband and I requested a king size bed, and we had two full size beds pushed together to make a king size, wasn't the biggest problem put if you like to cuddle it can be a little hard to do w/o falling through the cracks. The beds are also kind of hard so depending on what type of mattress your used to sleeping on you may have to ask for a mattress topper. Also we had no musty smell at all in our rooms, and A/C worked good. Food- Breakfast was good standard, with a lot of variety, because it it buffett style. Lunch was terriable it tasted like left overs from the dinner we had the night before, lunch was definitely nothing to write home about, I would say stock up on break fast and skip lunch. Dinner was good had a lot of variety something new every night. alacarte-we only tried the mexican resturaunt and it was good, we were not able to try the steak house or the japanise we missed the booking times. A word of advise book the dinners at 7 am if you want to try them. Pool- Swim up bar was great, the only complaint I had regarding the pool is that they put the bar in the childrens section of the pool, so you have to deal with a lot of splashing, splashing in your drink and splashing in your face while your drinking. The adult side of the pool was great the DJ always had music going, and you had a great view of the beach. Beach- The view is absolutely amaizing, now some people may complain about the big sand bags in the water because of the errosion, but honestly its only as big of a deal as you make it, the water and sand are beautiful the sun was out every single day the we were on the beach, you couldn't ask for a better view. Because of the swine flew hype there were so many empty beach chairs so we had good seats all the time. Service-The people there could not be friendlier, housekeeping, and also the waiters for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. and also the bartinders. Every one was nice had a upbeat attitude and always willing to help. You couldn't ask for a nicer staff. Must do's while in Mexico- Go on the Pirate cruise, absolutely fun all you can drink, great dinner and exstreamly entertaining. Also Xcaret-if your in to getting a little culture while you vacation this is the place to go, fun for the whole family they have a zoo and a water park there also. Also visit 5th Ave if you like to shop or barter All in all I would say if your looking for good service, descent food, beautiful scenery RYP is the place for you.", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, good service, friendly and clean. Great Experience!\u201d", "Author": "weebo", "ReviewID": "UR31258165", "Content": "We just returned from Playa Del Carmen, on May 22nd, where we stayed at the Riu Yucatan. I would definitely recommend this resort. We were scheduled to stay at the Riu Playacar, but due to the lack of tourists, we were moved to the Riu Yucatan. I am so glad, it was wonderful! In my opinion, I don't think anyone should worry about swine flu when traveling to the Yucatan Peninsula for vacation. We spoke to many of the locals in our resort (Riu Yucatan) and in PDC itself (including an ex-pat American who lives there) and they all said that there hasn't even been one case of swine flu in the Yucatan Peninsula. All the restaurant and resort staff are extremely careful with hygiene, and hand sanitizer is everywhere to make tourists feel safe. In my opinion from being there, the flu scare has been blown out of proportion and these people are feeling the pinch. Good news is, everywhere we went the locals were saying that tourism is getting better and even the cruise ships are coming back. I would go back next week if I could! They did take our temperature when we went through Mexican customs in the airport Friday. It\u2019s no big deal. They point a laser-type thingy at your head, they don\u2019t even touch you with it; takes 10 seconds. They checked both of us even though we marked NO on each question on the health forms. You have to fill out a form on the plane and in each airport about your health. Make sure you take a pen on the plane\u2026some people didn\u2019t and they had to borrow from others which takes more time. At the Mexican airport you might want to watch out for the people who try to stop you and try to sell you excursions. Leaving the airport and going to our transportation, we were accosted by many sales persons who misrepresented themselves as travel information persons. At the resort, we stayed in building four. It was near the pool but down two buildings, so no noise. I wouldn't want to be close to the pool/bars/live music. I don't go to bed early, but the noise was really loud down there... Because of the lack of tourists, they weren't using the other buildings further away from the pool/beach. The rooms are very nice. Like others have said, the beds are hard so you should request the sponge pad for the bed. We found that the staff were very responsive and took care of all our requests right away, but then the resort was only 35% full the week we were there. The mini bar was amazing! It had WHOLE bottles of rum, tequila and vodka in it, and also 16 oz bottles of Pepsi! I love soda pop in glass bottles and I remember when you could get them here in the US, so it was a treat for me to get a bottle of Pepsi, which I drank on the balcony. They also have beer and other sodas in the mini fridge. We were given extra water and sodas whenever we asked. The staff were extremely responsive and helpful, filling our requuests. As to cocktails, the mojitos are wonderful, but take your own plastic glass. Lots of people take thermal cups or plastic glasses because the glasses they give you for your drink are tiny. Make sure you tell the bartender you want the Bacardi rum or the Jose Cuervo Tequila, etc, otherwise you\u2019ll get the rock bottom, generic brand and it\u2019s kind of harsh. It changes the taste of the drink. They do have the better stuff, but you have to ask for it, even though it\u2019s sitting out on the bar counter. They also will give you a double shot if you ask for it, with no problem. The bartenders are very helpful and good natured. We ended up loving the sangria they make at the bars, it\u2019s very good, however the red wine alone is awful and the Rose is bad too. The white wine isn\u2019t too bad, it\u2019s drinkable, so that\u2019s the best choice for wine. I don't know about the liquor being watered down, but it wouldn't surprise me at all. Ask for double shots to counteract this problem. The food is very nice, but it is buffet food so you need to be picky if you are looking for quality. I had some bacon wrapped tenderloin steak that was excellent. Also the fruit and cold appetizers were good. My husband has a dairy allergy and is a picky eater but he could find a lot of choices there. I wouldn\u2019t worry about the specialty restaurants; they were buffet too and nothing special. I think the Chinese place (which we tried) was about like any Chinese buffet here in the states. The main buffet place was fine, but like others have said, you would get really tired of it after a week. The little town of Playa del Carmen is picturesque and charming, I would recommend you go into town. Take the taxi into Playa del Carmen for only five dollars and stop at La Ruinas cantina on the beach in PDC, between Ave Juarez and 2 Calle. It\u2019s a great little place to get wonderful margaritas and awesome chicken quesadillas. You can sit on the beach and watch the ocean. There is an interesting American guy named 'Poncho Frijoles' who is a fixture there and tells amazing stories of his 30+ years living in Mexico. The little shops in town sell jewelry and knick-knacks, and some of the stall owners can be pushy in selling to you, but that\u2019s part of the Mexican vibe. Definitely, staying at the Riu Yucatan was a great experience. We found the staff to be helpful and didn't have any trouble. I would strongly recommend this resort.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary A.B.", "Title": "\u201cNOT WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION... compared to other resorts in the area.\u201d", "Author": "laweld", "ReviewID": "UR31114820", "Content": "Let me start off by saying that there is nothing truly wrong with this resort, but as it is the 5th different A.I. resort my wife and I have stayed at in the last 4 years, we believe that a \"3\" is a reasonable rating, in comparrison to other A.I.'s in the same price range. When checking in, the front desk \"computer\" had our check out date wrong. I guess that an 8 day stay is uncommon so they had us checking out after 7 days, I should have brought an email print-out of our reservation, because they made me pay to use their computer to print out a copy, 60 pesos for internet time plus printer, so that I could as they said \"prove them wrong\". After \"giving\" them this print out, they were quick to make the correct change. At this time we also upgraded to a suite, \" 800 pesos per night X 8 nights = 6400 pesos\" (keep track of the \"s). Our suite was nice, but a bit dated, and although we mentioned it on the frst day, the A.C. did not work a single day that we were there, but we never spent much time in our room so we did not say anything again. The mini bar fridge is supposed to be re-stocked every-other day, and i did have to complain about this not happening on the 4th day, as we were out of water and beer, but this was quickly resolved (and yes, we had been tipping the maid 50 pesos every day). The grounds are very nice with a wide array of plants, trees, small animals, and yes even monkeys. The pool is a good size, two pool bars, (only one was open, due to the lack of guests) and a very large beach area. A lot of small fish use the beach sand bags for shelter, so you can do a bit of snorkeling around them, lots of Jacks and Sgt Majors. The nightly ent. is on par with other resorts we have stayed at, but this is the Caribbean, not Vegas, don't expect Cirque du Soleil. As far as having a cocktail at night, all of the drinks they make are pre mixed flavoured concoctions with booze added, no real fruit, coconut milk etc., and yes their booze is watered down, booze in a bottle will not have streaks running down the side unless it is mixed with water. Even their \"top shelf\" Havana Club rum is watered down, this is the rum i drink at home, and as soon as the bartender started to pour i could see that it was diluted. As far as the beer, only draft on the premesis, with the exception of the four bottles in you mini fridge. Helpful tip, if you are a beer drinker, go into PDC Walmart and buy a styrofoam cooler, 45 pesos, and 6 packs of Sol are only 54 pesos. We ate mostly at the buffet, this is good, but nothing to write home about, no fajitas? We also ate at two of the specialty restaurants, Shanghai, and Mexican, both were very good. A couple of our excurrsions found us getting back at 5:30p.m. a snack before dinner would be nice,(having not eaten all day) but all that woud be available until the buffet opened at 6:30 would be a tray of wieners and beans, no thx. We did find the service to be lacking at all meals, in comparisson to other A.I.'s. We filled our stay with many activities, Cancun, Cozummel (on scooters), Mamitas beach, Tulum, Xel-Ha, and of course cruising PDC, so on our \"7th\" day we decided to chill pool-side at the resort. After breakfast we headed to the pool, (styrofoam cooler and beer in hand) with the resort at such low occupancy you could sit anywhere. After a couple hours i went back to our room to get a few more beer, (this should have been restocking day) but not only was there no beer, we had a note saying that we were being charged for a late check-out ($50 USD) as we had not yet vacated our room! I proceeded to take the note to the front desk to question them. I tried to be pleasent with the front desk people, giving them the benefit of the doubt that this would be quickly resolved, no such luck. The \"computer\" says we check-out today, 2800 pesos if we want to stay another day, and guess what, they can't find the email reservation print out i gave them when we checked-in, without this we are required to pay or leave, if this is not right, they told me to \"prove them wrong\" I went to our room to get the receipt for our room up-grade as it showed 8 days of up-grade. They would not accept this as proof of an 8 day reservation, but instead told me that i was charged for eight days up-grade by accident, but because i signed off on the receipt...no money back. Now i am mad. I told them of the inccident checking in and asked if i could use a computer \"on the house\". NO, the cost is 40 pesos for internet time, and 20 for the printing. Unbelievable, back to the computer. After looking over the print-out, and a 45 minute phone call, the clerk tells me that he has taken care of it and we can stay another night, and as if he has done us a favour in straightening it out, no appology of any kind. 2 hours out of the best part of the day, not the way you want to cap off a trip. My wife and I can forgive and forget with the best of them, but even with the check-out problem aside, given the overall level of servce, food availability, rooms, and grounds, in comparrison to other resorts, we can not rate this resort any higher than a \"3\".

The grounds were beautifully landscaped and the beach was the largest that we found in either direction in Playacar. The sand whales are not the most attractive feature but they have definitely done their job in preserving the depth of the beach. The water is a crystal clear aqua color and shallow enough to walk out fairly far. Also, the beach sand is never hot so don't worry about burning your feet. The resort itself has kind of a jungle like atmosphere with palm trees and native animals roaming the grounds. You'll see little rabbit-like squirrels running around and hear Howler Monkeys in the trees above you. The best time to get pictures or video of the Monkeys is around dinner. The rooms are nothing special and can use some updating. We had a leaky shower faucet the entire week (never reported it), and there was a musty smell when you first walk into the room. Our king size bed was actually two full size beds pushed together and were a bit hard but you can request a foam mattress topper from the front desk. As for the beverages in the room; they are restocked every other day and you may have to call the front desk to get more water, soda, beer, etc. In any case, the rooms were more than adequate for our stay and if you are going to Playa Del Carmen you shouldn't be in the room that much anyways. We stayed in room 21** and were in a great location in comparison to most of the other buildings (the resort is pretty big); we were a 15 second walk to the pool and beach area and also the main lobby and restaurants. The food was okay at the resort; we weren't crazy about anything in particular but did eat the guacamole at least twice a day. The Hacienda buffet had the same stuff every day and the quality wasn't too bad. The Mexican restaurant had the best quality for sit down dinner, better steak than even the Steak House, but you have to wake up early to get a reservation there. The steak house was decent; I had the ribs and my beautiful lady had the steak. I think I liked my ribs more than she liked her steak. The Asian restaurant was pretty good; they had a good assortment of sushi rolls, sashimi and Japanese food in a buffet style. Definitely bring Immodium with you just in case you have a sensitive stomach because there is the possibility you won't react well the first day or five. The drinks at all the bars are pretty decent. We drank Mojito's and Miami Vice's most of the week and never felt like they were watered down. Your choice of beer is limited to draft Dos Equis, you only have bottles in your room. The bar tenders work very hard and will remember you if you throw them a couple bucks every few drinks. This pays off when the bars get packed... There is a room above the Hacienda buffet that we stumbled into one night that was playing club music. We had a great time up there and still aren't sure if it is something they do every night or if it was a private party. Regardless, we got in and had a great time so keep an eye out for that. The club across the street at Riu Tequila was full of drunk college age kids so if that is not your scene, definitely beware. There are great shops within walking distance of the hotel where you can buy souvenirs and gifts for family. You can also buy excursions there which we heard were cheaper than buying at the hotel. We however bought our excursions at the hotel and definitely wish we had checked the market because they were very pricey. The two trips we chose were a day trip to Coba and swimming with the dolphins through Delphinus. The dolphins were pretty expensive ($165US/person) and pictures taken by their photographer ran $25US each. The place is a research facility so the money hopefully goes to good and our instructor was top notch. We had about an hour in the water with the dolphins and really had a great time; the dolphins are amazing. Our Coba trip was fantastic; it was an all day trip and cost $100US/person. We had a coach bus transportation to the ruins, access to the ruins (Coba is the highest ruin in the Yucatan and the only one people can climb), lunch at a local restaurant, a visit with two Mayan families and ended the day with a refreshing swim in a cenote (sacred well). Our tour guide Stefano was the man and was extremely knowledgeable about Mayan culture. The Coba trip was a definite highlight of our trip and is highly recommended. Overall, the trip was great. The resort is beautiful, the beach and weather were gorgeous, the staff is extremely happy and accommodating, the food is decent enough for a week or two and the rooms are better than bearable.

You want awsome food and great variety, it's all here. 3 awsome specialty restaurants you can make reservations for as many times as you want, PLUS an unending buffet dining room, open for breakfast lunch and dinner.

We would go up to the bar, and the bartender would already have our drinks being made with out us asking, they remembered what we liked and were very attentative all night long. All the drinks you want from 10am till 2am. Even brand name liquiors like Bacardi, and smirnoff. NICE! The entertainment staff were a riot. They would ask you to play crazy games, dance lessons, yoga on the beach, shooting range and even water polo.

The rooms are small, smell of mildew and have very hard beds. Upon my arrival I noticed the shower light was burned out and the shower head was broken. A guy from maintenace came by, looked at it and never came back to fix it. Mini bar/fridge was lame and was never re-stocked unless I asked for it. The rooms were in desperate need of a face lift. Old style tile, paint and decorations. The lamps were rusty and there were stains on the walls. Resort grounds are mediocre and the pools are dirty. Their \"signature\" restaurants in the resort are not very good and the food quality within the resort is again mediocre to say the best. The staff is for the most part unfriendly and one night during dinner insulted my girlfriend for being with a \"white boy\". My girlfriend is Hispanic and I'm Caucasian. We tried to enter the Riu Palace next door just to see what it was like, and whether we would stay there on our next visit. We were denied entry and told we couldn't even look around. The biggest complaint I have about this resort is the employees and the fact they go out of their way to make it inconvienient for you. They act as if they are doing you a favor by waiting on you and would prefer you not bother them at all.

A superb holiday that EVERYBODY enjoyed!! If you are going here, you will have a fantastic time! - LOCATION: The hotel is in the hotel zone of Playacar and is therefore surrounded by other hotels. A short 5-10 minute walk takes you to the small centre of Playacar with lots of souvenir shops and places to book excursions. Security barriers are in place at all entrances to the Resort, making it the safest place we have ever stayed! We walked to Playa Carmen but it took us considerably longer than 25 mins - more like 45-50! very busy and bustling, but lots of street acts to watch. -SETTING: The monkies (they didn't wake us!!) were an added bonus as it gave the hotel a really tropical feel. The gardens and grounds are immaculate, although the public toilets could do with more attention. the beach is wide, white sand and although initially the sand bags are very noticable, you soon forget them! In fact we often used to sit on them to watch the children in the sea, dangling our feet in the warmer water trapped behind them. If you want your photos without the bags, just walk along the beach to the right for about 10 mins. - SUNBEDS: You really do have to be down to the pool area before 7.30 to get a sunbed, although there are always loads free on the beach. On the last day we were determined to get the front row position overlooking the beach, so arrived at 6.30am - but yes it was worth it!! We were there over Easter so it may be quieter the rest of the year. -ROOMS: We had 2 rooms between the 5 of us, so plenty of space. We had 2 double beds in each room and we did not find them hard, although we are used to a 'firm' bed at home. The rooms were kept very clean and were fine. We had a problem with our air conditioning but it was mended within 24 hours. -TRIPS: We booked via Thomson and know that we paid way over for the trips, but it was convenient and 'safe', had there been a problem - which there was!! We booked the 'fastcat' which was later cancelled due to the water being too rough. We then booked Tulum (very interesting, but very hot!) and the 'jungle tour'. Our rep tried to put us off this trip, but it was BRILLIANT! Driving your own speedboat across the sea was extremely exhillerating, plus some snorkelling as well! REALLY RECOMMEND THIS TRIP! -RESTAURANTS AND FOOD: Excellent - loads of choice. We also ate at the specialist restaurants - 3 times at the Mexican (fab); once at the Thai (good) and once at the steakhouse (not so good - steaks very tough). -MOSQUITTOES: I am afraid I have to mention these pests! I was very concerned before we left, when I found out that mosquittoes were a problem in this area, as my husband is highly allergic to bites, so we took every precaution possible! We took plug-ins for the rooms, vitamin B tablets to lessen the reaction to the bites, covered ourselves in repellents (both Autan Tropical and Jungle Tropical were excellent), and often wore trousers and long-sleeved tops in the evening. We stil got 3-4 bites each but these occurred either in the room or at breakfast - once we realised this, we put some spray on before breakfast and also sprayed around our door frame in the morning and evening to keep them away! The mosquittoes love the smell of shampoo, so make sure you have lots of repellent on around your neck!! We had a fantastic holiday, and loved Mexico!

Very few negatives but the usual poolside sun lounger grabbing 'early towels game' applies, an issue that no-one has ever resolved, so either live with it or choose one of the many sunloungers on the beach.

We had a really good time. The staff was excellent overall, and a couple deserve special recognition - Felix \"Call Number Nine\" at the front desk, Leo in the main dining room and Armando at the bar - you went out of your way to make our stay enjoyable - Gracias! Food was very good everywhere on the property. For a la carte restaurants, we tried the Asian and Steak restaurants and were very happy with both. Baked Alaska and Fried Ice Cream for desserts were a nice touch! The buffet never disappointed us. There was always a good selection for everyone. The rooms were always clean, though a bit small for a family of four. We asked for and received a cot, which made a big difference. The two seniors had plenty of room - maybe they should have taken in a grand-kid for a night or two! Here are the areas that I think could use some improvement. There is a shortage of shaded spots for lounge chairs. The only grass umbrellas are located poolside, so there is little or no shade on the beach. In order to get a decent spot, someone in your group needs to be poolside by 7am. There are plenty of lounge chairs, but the premium spots are too few. Similarly, restaurant bookings must be made same day when the restaurant opens for breakfast. If you are flexible on time (early sitting is 6:45 late sitting 8:45) and traveling in a small group then you probably have little to worry about. Our group size presented some challenge, but we managed. Having to wake up before 7am while on vacation to get lounge chairs and restaurant reservations is a bit of a pain. The nightly entertainment was generally enjoyable, but with young kids the starting time (main events were starting at 9:30) seemed rather late to us. We found that killing some time between dinner and the entertainment by going into Play del Carmen was a pretty good option. Unfortunately, we didn't discover this until our last night! The cab ride is cheap - 50 Pesos - and takes hardly any time at all. We took a tour to Xcaret and had a wonderful time. It was a bit expensive, but we spent a full day there and I would probably say we got close to full value for our money. A couple of us did a \"discover scuba diving\" dive through the dive centre and really enjoyed ourselves. Cecilio and Javier took good care of us, as did the rest of the crew. A couple of us took advantage of the Spa for massage and found it great. There is WiFi in the lobby only, which I found to be okay. It was enough to sync up for emails a couple of times, but this wasn't a priority for me. Would I go to the Riu Yucatan again? Sure, absolutely.

The asian restaurant-good. We are not picky eaters by any means, it just wansn't 5 star food. Sand Bags on the beach- Kinda ruined the overall beach pictures, however it does save the sand on the beach. If you walk down a ways you can have a beach w/o sand bags. Nightlife- NOT good. We are 25 yrs old and expected some good entertainment since its in such an enclosed area. We ended up going to Playa Del Carmen to CoCo bongs (AWESOME!!) and just drinking down there in general, so many things to do and so much better!! Mosquitos in the rooms was another drag. When the house keeping would come and clean they would leave all the doors open and tons of mosquitos would come in.

I would rate this hotel 4 star (which was how it was advertised with Thomson). It's situated right on the beach and I felt the best beach along the strip of hotels in Playacar. It was really busy when we went, yet there were always sunbeds available on the beach. We unfortunately didn't get up early enough to get a sunbed by the pool, but the beach was so fantastic I would probably have chosen that anyway. There were plenty of activities at the scuba centre, and the hotel ran its own activities during the day - but its not really our thing, so we didn't partake, but there was plenty to do if you wanted. The rooms are quite basic and probably not an ultra high standard in terms of decor etc, but if you want 5 star luxury, pay more and go to the Rui Palace Mexico or Rivera Maya down the road. We had all we needed and the room also included a fridge filled with branded soft drinks and water, Optics in the room and even an iron and ironing board! The service at the hotel was briliant, the Mexicans couldn't do enough to help and were so friendly and welcoming, nothing was too much trouble. Our room was cleaned daily with fresh towels left as well as toiletries and the fridge re-stocked every 2 days. The hotel has four restaurants. The main buffet restaurant was massive, yet the quality of food was a really high standard and great choice, something for everyone and the desserts were to die for! The other 3 restaurants had to be booked early on the morning for the evening you wanted to visit them. We managed to book into the Steak House which was very good, it was a set menu with a choice of about 4 dishes for the main course, I had steak which was massive, worth trying out while you are staying there. However, we still prefered the buffet as there was just so much to chose from. You can also use the facilities at the sister hotels, Riu Playacar which is a smaller hotel just down the road - very nice though, and the Riu Tequilla which we didn't visit. Should you get bored with the hotel, there are plenty of trips that can be booked by your rep or on Playacar Plaza and a taxi to Playa del Carmen is only $5. I'd definitely recommend buying your suncream and gifts from there rather than the hotel shop as they tend to be a bit of a rip off. This is on of the best holidays I've had for a long time, fabulous weather for the past 2 weeks and the hotel definitely made the holiday special because of their attention to detail.

We dropped a couple off at a Secrets first. The driver drove past our turnoff and went all the way down to the Occidental to drop off more people before finally driving back north (in a very roundabout way) to finally drop us off-40 minutes later.

It is a corner room, so one side of the balcony faces the tennis courts and the other faces the Tequila pathway. The trees have grown a lot, so the view of the Palace and horizon is very limited.

You can also go to the walking path that will take you right out to The RIU Tequila and the Mall located down the back left stairs from \"La Margarita\"; located all the way to the left when facing the beach from the pool area. 5th Av, in town, is the tourist spot. Cab ride into 5th Avenue is 50 peso's. Cabs are available anywhere at any hour. We tried walking to town from the beach and ended up moving up to the street when a private residence blocked the beach. We stayed on the first parallel street and kept walking and it brought us to a restaurant with an outside porch across from the beginning of 5th Av. The street itself is not driven on. There are shops, restaurants and bars, along with the ferry to Cozumel. We did the trip to Chichen Itza, for $99 pp. They put you on a very nice modern bus, with AC. Beverages and snacks are served up and back. They first take you to Cenote Il Kil. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SzIbOnrus&feature=related I did not take this, I copied the link. I jumped in from the top of the stairs. The water was fantastic and only wished we had done this AFTER the Chichen Itza tour. They then take you to lunch in an authentic mayan restaurant. The food was buffet style, and ok. They had traditional dancers that dance first with a beer on their heads then with a tray and glass. Very colorful dresses on the woman. Chichen Itza was quite fantastic and the guide(came with us on the bus) was very good. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1TUnAdG0_E Again, not my video. We also went to Rio Secreto and did a cave tour for $49 pp. http://www.riosecretotours.com/ This was absolutely fabulous. The guide is knowledgeable and personable. There is no describing the feeling you get when you are swimming in crystal clear water, with flashlights and the stalagmites a couple of inches from your head. They provide helmets, wetsuits and life vests. They also give a nice lunch after the tour. They photograph you and offer pictures at the end of the tour loaded on to PCs. These are very good. There are lockers on site and they are safe so you can stow a credit card to purchase pictures. Not for the claustrophobic or those who are afraid of the dark. Rio Secreto was the highlight of my trip. Highlights good and bad: Weather was 85 during the day 75 at night. Clouds and Sun with an occasional shower. No complaints. The beach was awesome. The staff is very friendly and courteous. They will make any drink. They have top shelf liquor for the asking. There is no Ginger Ale. My normal Jim Beam and Ginger was not available. 7UP and a splash of Pepsi doesn't make it. I went to Elhimodor(sic?) Margaritas. Dos XXXs is the only beer served. Mezcal shots are a must. If you like tequila. Sandwiches can be had after hours at the lobby bar. Smoking is allowed except in restaurants. See Eduardo. He is the best bartender.

Even though our experience was very positive in general, I would like to start with a negative in case you are too impatient to read it all to the end. I would like to warn people with kids: the kids club was disappointing comparing to other kids clubs in Mexican hotels. The person in charge, Greta, does not care about kids, especially younger ones as they are more hustle for her. Not much job done, very short hours of operation. Mini disco was very repetative. One contest was extremely disappointing when kids were judged and given \"points\", very inappropriate and frustrating for some children. We had great experiences with other kids clubs previously and did not expect it would be negative in Riu Yucatan. The three restaurants ( Steak house, Mexican and Asian) are also mostly buffet style, and we did not like any of them due to lack of choice. The main buffet had excellent food with lots to choose from for all tastes. Hotel entertainment was especially good whenever they invited other groups of dancers/ actors. The Riu Yucatan team itslef is average even though they try their best. Pamela and Aracelli were wonderful. We could not understand why their choreographer who is pretty overwheight, had to be the stage star all the time. Also, beware of loosing your safe key, they charge you 50 dollars for that. The system of a key on a string you can not even adjust when you hang it on your neck, is very dated and does not go with a five star rate of the hotel. We have stayed in other hotels throughout Mexico and found this one of unexpectedly good service. The reception team is wonderful, grounds are beautiful and clean. Rooms are quite spacious but all of sudden you discover that there is no light in your shower ( it just does not exist by some reason...) and no door to the shower, only to the washroom. It is incovenient when you stay in one room with your kids. We were not interested in swimming pools ( they are very average) and stayed only on the beach which is probably the best among the nearby hotels ( and the sea is fabulous!). Pass a few other hotel beaches and continue walking along the white sand on a pretty wild beautiful strip of a beach with jungles on your right - it is a luxury you do not often get in other locations. We took some great trips to Xel-Ha, Tulum and Riu Secreto ( Riu Secreto -not appropriate for kids under eight!! We had to ask for refund). We would love to come back to see more and more.

My wife and I are veteran travelers and we have been to Mexico 10 or 12 times, although this was our first time on the Gulf Coast. First of all I should say that we flew Skyservice as part of the package and I must say that it was not a very pleasant experience. As many of you who have flown Skyservice will already know, the seats are so close together that you cannot really ever get comfortable. Our flight was about 3 1/2 hours and by the end I was in agony from being so cramped. I can not imagine how anyone could spend 5 or 6 hours on those aircraft. We were also not impressed by the Sunquest staff on site. He was not very engaging and his answer to every question seemed to be a tour promotion. We gave up on him and used the hotel staff to give us information. They were all very helpful and accommodating. This hotel offers excellent value. It is a nice property in a very good location with great staff and very nice rooms. The ability to utilize the other Riu properties, (Tequila & Playacar) is a nice advantage. As with any A.I. that relies on buffets, it gets a bit repetitious. Although the Tequila and the Playacar offer essentially the same thing, it did feel like a change. We also took a tour of the two Riu \"Palace\" properties on the strip and they are certainly more elegant, but then they are more expensive. As others have said, 5th Avenue is very pricey for Mexico. I found prices for silver etc. to be much better on the Pacific side of the country. Having said that, we still managed to shop and we bargained hard enough that we could live with our purchases. It seemed to us that the farther you went north on 5th, the better the prices got. We are very fond of amber and found a place that had a terrific selection of amber on 5th near Calle 6, called Ambar Mexicano. The prices were not great but the variety of pieces was outstanding. The most that we could manage was a 10% discount. Ask for Laura. By the way it seemed that the price of a cab from the hotel was always 50 pesos no matter where you are going in Playa Del Carmen. As others have mentioned, we also got massages at Veronicas. It is on 5th just past the major intersection of Constituthenes, (pretty sure that I have this spelling messed up but you will get the idea). If you go to the information booth close by on 5h, they have discount coupons for Veronicas. We had two massages for $55 U.S. The massages were first class. In summary, the hotel offers great value, Playa Del Carmen is fun but not cheap and we will never fly Skyservice again.

When we returned the next day we were given a room just s few steps from the pool on the ground floor of block five. Great location! The room was fine. Nothing to write home about but then again we didn't go on vacation to sit all day in our rooms. It was clean and the fridge was always well stocked with beer ans soft drinks.

The rest of the time we ate at the main buffet restaurant which I've always found to be the best option. Lots of fresh fruit in the a.m. along with omlettes and just about anything else youwould want for breakfast. Dinners were great - seafood, beef wellington, chicken, steak, pork...etc. were all good. My only complaint is that the coffee and wine are sub par. Tea and beer were good substitutes though! As for lunch were at at the beach restaruant which was also good. The pool and the beach are great. There is some shade on the beach but not alot. If you don't eant the sun on you all day your best bet is to snag a chair by the pool under one of the umbrellas. The beach is great. The sand whales are not as much of an eyesore as you might think. They have saved the beach which is beautiful. Service at the pool bars (or any of the other bars for that matter) was great. As for the nightly entertainment, I've seen a whole lot better at other Riu resorts. We tended to go into Playa Del Carmen at night which was also fantastic. It's only a $5.00 cab ride and a must see. Try the Parrot Beach Club on any night. They have a fire show on the beach at 11pm which is a must see. It's also a great dance club. There are many restaurant's and bars along 5th Avenue which extends for several kilometers.

Bartenders Donas, Jose, Eduardo, and Fernando definitely took care of us. We tipped them good the first couple of days we were there and they NEVER forgot about us.

If you eat there you might want to get the Braised Chicken instead of a steak...the steak is not the best. The chicken was awesome. Rooms....they were nice. Maids forgot our towels a couple times but brought them right away when they were asked to. A lil musty but like i said....it's in the jungle! Nicest thing....NO BUGS! a few mosquito's but never really saw any bugs. Yes the liquor in the dispensor is cheap but we never drank it. We didnt sit around the room and drink at all.

We booked 4 excursions on 2 different days to the tune of $900 for 4 people...They were 2 excursions each day and lasted almost all day. BEST DAY picked us up after being an hour late, and had the wrong reservations. The driver called the ranch (Lomas Ranch) and they \"supposedly\" said it was \"no problem\". The driver drove us an hour away to the ranch and we find out it ISNT ok. They booked the wrong reservation than what was on our receipt. Then they told us we couldnt do the excursion anyway because a member of our group was \"overweight\" and they had a weight limit. At this time they take us back to the resort and tell us that Best Day will give us our money back. That was NOT true. BEST DAY refused to give us our money back saying we could have done \"another\" excursion there. We ended up getting our money back 4 days later only because we decided to sit next to the BEST DAY salesman and tell EVERYONE not to buy anything from him. These salesman make commission off of you.

These beers are supposed to be replaced every day; however ours was stocked once, after we called the front desk, with hot beer that did not get cold until the next day. On to the drinks at the bars. While the service at the bars was friendly, the drinks were made from premade mixtures which I'm confident had little to no alcohol in them. Also, the drinks were served in tiny plastic cups that could be consumed by a normal humanbeing in 5 minutes, and it was a good walk to get another. It should be noted too that the wine that they served is probably a step below Franzia. Next, the food. The food was extremely unsatisfying.

The good points far outweigh the negatives hands down. Good points : The hotel staff are fantastic and cannot help you enough with any small problems that may arise and always with a smile. The hotel grounds are kept in pristine condition. The beach is in fantastic condition, considering it had been obliterated by the hurricane only 2 yrs ago. The sand is pure white, soft and surprisingly never gets hot. As always, the sea is beautiful and the `whales' that so many moan about, are actually not a problem at all. Breakfast and dinner in the main dining area is great, with lots of choice. We tended to take lunch in the beach bar, which was great also. The speciality Chinese was nothing to write home about, but the Steakhouse was lovely. The rooms could do with some modernising, like key cards for the room and keypads for the safe, but we found them more than good enough in the whole and the maids make them spotless every day, also with some extravagant animal `towel art' on most occasions. The night time entertainment is split on alternate nights with shows provided by the hotel team & acts brought in. The acts brought in were fantastic, whereas the hotel teams acts were simply funny to watch, as some of it was very amateurish, but still watchable, especially with numerous cocktails having been necked beforehand. There are literally loads of cute looking rodents freely roaming around the gardens that look like a warped mixture of a rat, rabbit & squirrel & not forgetting the howler monkeys, that are great to watch in the trees, but not so great when they wake you up with their screaming at 5am.... Now to the evening bar staff by the pool after 6pm... what a truely fantastic bunch of guys & gals, especially Jubilee, Israel, Donis & little Neomi. I have never seen such a hard working bunch in all my life, with great sense of humours to boot. Bad points: The entertainment guy who wrecked the peace around the pool at 4pm every day. He needs to turn the volume down on his microphone to cater for the 20 or so people who are interested in his `games', rather than annoying the other 200 or so, who aren't !! The swimming pool could definitely do with warming up a tad...a bit on the chilly side. Never buy anything from the hotel's convenience store...$11 for two packets of crisps !! Overall, my girlfriend & I had the most amazing 2 weeks there and loved almost every second. The idea was for a relaxing time away together & that's exactly what we got.

It was very windy the week we were there and all but two were \u2018red flag\u2019 days. We were in building 5 on the 3rd floor and had a beautiful view of the pool and ocean from our balcony. The room was clean, quiet, and comfortable. We had a different towel animal each day. Every afternoon about 4:00 a family of 3 monkeys would come to our balcony looking for food. My guess is the previous occupants were feeding them. In previous stays we would eat most of our meals in the specialty restaurants but this trip we only ate once at the Mexican and once at the Steak house. Both meals were very good (love the tortilla soup at the Mexican place). This year we found the buffet had some of the best food we\u2019ve had at an all-inclusive; beef Wellington, roast pork, fish and on numerous occasions shrimp. All the staff work hard and are very friendly. We loved the bartenders here. In fact a few even remembered us from last year (is that a good thing?). \u2026Hey Eduardo!!! There is always some sort of activity around the pool, inside the lobby and evening shows. We met a lot of great people and wanted nothing but a longer stay. My only negative and this is being picky, because we will definitely return for a 5th visit, was I had sent 3 e-mails with a room/building request because we were traveling with friends and all e-mails went unanswered. At check-in there were so many people checking in at once that we didn\u2019t get any personal service or a chance to voice our requests. As it turned out we were next door to our friends. I was just a little disappointed that as a returning guest there wasn\u2019t a little perk.", "Date": "February 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Rapids", "Title": "\u201cExcellente!!!\u201d", "Author": "nekeddie", "ReviewID": "UR24638888", "Content": "If you decide to stay here, you will understand my review title.

The shows at night were great. They bring in outside entertainment on half the nights, but our favorites were done by them. Some of the other reviews were right about the food. It was not always available when I wanted, but it was fine. I would have liked a late night snack place, or even an ice cream cone. Overall the food was good, but the menu on the buffet did not change a lot. If I was there for the food, I would have been disappointed, but my wife thought it was really good. It was easy to get from one part of this resort to the other which was a huge plus. If you go there, take the time to make your own pottery souvenier right down by the beach. It was fun and inexpensive. Also, If you want to go parasailing or jet skiing, find Fransisco on the beach. He is super friendly and helpful, and he works very hard. Trust me, write that down.

It was the best time. This resort was amazing, everyone that worked there made everything perfect. They were happy, friendly, helpful people. We wanted for nothing but a longer to stay. The rooms were great and always clean, plenty of space. The whole resort was clean, there was always someone working on the lawns, trees, cleaning the pool. They supplied umbrellas at the front desk when it rained. The bartenders were amazing to watch and they were always kept busy. They work 15 hours a day 6 days a week and I don\u2019t think anyone from the US would still be smiling and entertaining people after that many hours. These employees were always happy. We had the use of all four other RIU resorts in the area. We had people come to the Yucatan and say that it was the best out of all of them. Way better, more friendly, than the Playacar & the Tequila, better beaches than the Palace. We went to the Tequila and the people there were not as friendly and were even rude. There were always activities around the pool, inside the lobby, the evening entertainment was wonderful. The fire dancers were simply amazing. They would entertain the children as well. We could not find anything to complain about for the entire week. Except the smell from the water in the toilets, but that is the only thing. Apple Vacations was great. They picked us up at the airport upon arrival and were there at exactly the pick-up time for departure (even though it was 3 AM). We very much hoped they would forget us and we could stay longer.

We had previously stayed at Riu Playacar a few years before so we knew what to expect from the nearby Yucatan. Pros: The beach is very large with a good mix of shady and sunny spots. The sand is very nice and the water is beautiful. There are plenty of the large sandbags to protect the shore but they are done well. If you walk down the beach a way you will see resorts where they have not done the sandbagging and the beaches are terribly eroded. The pool area is fairly large and it is nice to have two pool bars. There are some prime pool chairs where you can be at the pool but overlooking the ocean - very nice! Room was very clean - beds were comfortable. Had to request a blanket but got it right away. TV and A/C and mini-fridge all worked well. Buffet had a very large variety of food that was always hot and fresh. Loved the automatic coffee/espresso machines at all the drink locations around the resort. Very international mix of guests makes for good people watching and fun conversation. (if topless sunbathing and naked toddlers offend you - beware) Cons: Our room was very outdated. The mirror in the bathroom was eroding and had dark spots on it. The drapes were faded and garish. We were on the ground floor and the hallway noise was very loud. The toilets flushing on upper floors sounded like they were in our room. Shower was very dark - needs a light in the stall. Pool entertainment during the daytime was too loud! You could hear it quite loudly on the beach even. Buffet area was way too crowded. Tables were also very close together. When we were there they were not doing dinner seatings and so perhaps that made it more crowded. Hated being clapped for by the staff when entering the dining room - strange.

We also had a key/ lock for safety deposit box. Not electronic key pad...another key to carry around. Our first room was bad. When you walked in, all you could smell was mildew. The A/C was broken. The liquor cabinet was broken. The TV was broken. The remote didn't work. The chairs for the small table were missing. No ironing board and no extra blanket for the bed. We went to the front desk and requested another room but weren't able to move until the next day. The next room was much better. The housekeeping could have been better. The onsite entertainment was ok. The food was ok. Would have been nice to have more option for a sit down dinner. The buffet got old. And there is no room service! Plus, getting drinks at the buffet or even the pool was a hassle. My boyfriend and I stayed at Iberostar Paraiso Beach last year, and that is all we could compare it to. RIU doesn't even come close to the service we received there. So it was really dissappointing to see an Iberostar right next to our resort. We probably will never stay at a RIU resort again.

Since we are frequent guests at the Iberostar Tucan next door - we tended to compare everything to Iberostar - which is a better resort. The weather was not so great during our stay.

The rooms & housekeeping were fine. The king beds are actually 2 smaller beds pushed together. There were plenty of hangers in the closet. The bath gel & shampoo are in little packets which are annoying to use - at IB Tucan there are shampoo & bath gel dispensers in the really nice big shower stalls. This resort did not have good service in the buffet restaurants. Some meals we just got our own drinks. Our dirty plates were not taken for a while. The service and food at IB Tucan was much better. The food at Riu Yuc was mediocre. At the buffet we could usually find something that was OK - nothing great. We ate at all 3 special restaurants. The steakhouse was our favorite. Had really good Caesar salad and sirloin steak. The Asian restaurant was pretty good, too. It was buffet style but the food was better than the regular buffet. The Mexican restaurant was horrible. The soup & appetizers were buffet style but the entree was served to us. We had some kind of steak which had a very weird texture to it & neither of us or the guy at the next table could eat it. We all left before dessert and went to the regular buffet for some food. The resort itself was nice. We had alot of monkey sightings right outside our room every day.

Always had fresh towles. Refrigerator was always stocked w/ Corona, water, Pepsi, 7-Up, and an orange soda... *The food was quite good. Both the buffetts and the specialty restaraunts. We enjoyed the Asian & Mexican the best. The steakhouse was ok but maybe our expectations for steak are a little higher since we are raised on Iowa Beef?? *The Resort overall was very nice and clean. *Had a massage on the beach. $54.00 for an hour. I enjoyed it very much.. *Close to Playa Del Carmen / 5th Avenue. Cab ride was $5.00 / one way. *Entertainment... We enjoyed the music they had before the Animacion team started their entertainment. They had a Mariachi Band one night, a trumpet player one night and a guy playing the Alto Sax another night and they also brought in a band w/ a fire show on our last evening there. Dislikes/Disappointments: *The Beach was ok. Better than I had expected but the sand whales are quite an eye sore. I understand their function but just kinda made the beach ugly. They are still working on repairing the beach. I did walk down the beach...to the right of the resort.. The Iberostar and Sandos was next door and I would say their beach was worse but after you get past those two resorts there are no sand bags...beach is a little nicer. The beach just isn't that deep either...so I kinda felt like the beach loungers were all on top of each other.... I like to be spread out a little and with more palm trees on the beach... But this is just my preferrance.. *Entertainment/Animacion Team- Boring...... I know they work hard to put on a show for everyone but they need to come up w/ some better skits... *The Sewer Smell??? A few days, laying out by the beach, there was an overhwelming sewer smell.... As you can tell I had more likes than dislikes... Would I return? Not so sure...... only because of the beach issue.

Unless you book one of the speciality restaurants you need to eat in the buffet but the choice of food is excellent and varies most nights. This is also where you have breakfast and you are spoit for choice. The other restaurants added more variety although i think their menus stay the same every night, but again there is a large choice in each one. The entertainment team work very hard and put on enjoyable shows at night, most is dancing to themed shows such as the abba show, the michael jackson show and so on but they are very good. During the day they run various activities you can join in if you like, such as beach volleyball, dancing and spanish lessons, bingo, water polo etc etc. Playa del Carmen is a nice little town, far removed from Cancuun which is pretty dire, big hotels and shopping malls. We ate out twice in Playa but found the food in the hotels to be better although i think that was just our bad luck in choice of restaurants. We did quite a few trips, mostly booked through our thomson rep. You can prob do them cheaper, we did tulum by local bus, it cost $7 return where as Thomson charge $38 for the trip. We did book Chichen Itza though and the guide was very good. Would not recommend a trip over to Cozumel unless you plan to hire a car, too many people trying to sell stuff and not any nice beaches near the ferry port.

The girls at the kids-club were a godsend (lilyann and greta) they would pic the children up at 10am and keep them entertained until after lunch!, the rest of the entertainment staff worked hard, as did the rest of the staff, to make your stay there as enjoyable as possible. Our wedding went to a tee.. on the beach with so many people watching (which I didn't mind!) We did the xel-ha trip, which was amazing and beautiful, I would definatley recommend, we also did the dolphin, manitee and sea-lion trip, which was real value for money and absolutely amazing! The shows in the evening were lots of fun, micheal jackson being one of the best!

As for the hard beds, we thought the beds were just fine, we slept very well. The resort itself is kept very clean, always someone about sweeping up leaves and keeping the place nice. RESTAURANTS: Steakhouse is lovely, we managed to go 3 times, Mexican and Asian ok but nothing to write home about. The main buffet restaurant was great, you could always find something. Anyone who complained must be very picky eaters. When you think they cater for a vast number of nationalities so you can't please everyone. The bar staff work very hard, they always remember what you drink, and if you tip them a couple of dollars the drinks just keep coming. The entertainment staff do a wonderful job, the evening shows are very good. TRIPS: We did the Coba Mayan village which was good, you get to go into the villages where they live and they take you to the last pyramid in Mexico that you can climb. We did the F1 speedboat, NOT for the faint-hearted but it was good. It was worth it for the snorkelling. We did the dolphin/manatee/sealion experience which is well worth the money, and you have to get the dvd as it's a lovely memory. We also went to Cozumel but we did that one by ourselves, just went into Playa Del Carmen and got a return ferry ticket which was $28 each. The shopping in Playa Del Carmen is good, plenty of places to grab a bargain.

I had been watching the reviews for so long, since January of 2008. Everytime I would see something bad I would get all nervous and worried about the place that I booked. Honestly, it truely is a beautiful resort. We arrived Sept. 30, and were welcomed by the hotel staff with a lovely drink, and directed to our hotel room. We stayed until Oct. 7th. The room I felt was perfect. I really felt at home, I read a review where one complained about there only being a curtain to block the bathroom- oh get over it. I thought it was neat, and honestly you are probably traveling with family or a loved one. There is a door on the bathroom so seriously, you can do that business without one hearing it, haha. and the shower had a curtain and when you got out you dried off and got dressed. The bathroom was actually perfect in my eyes, The woodwork in the room was awesome. The bathroom very spacious. The beds were not that hard- seriously people, complain complain. I slept amazing there, the beds were just fine. Pools were awesome as well, good size and not overly crowded, swim up bars were awesome. They were all very clean. Restaurants: The buffet \"La Hacinda\" (something like that) pretty repetative and sort of dull taste, however, you never went hungary, you could always find sometime to eat. Amazing breakfast buffet too. And usually you book a specialty restaurant at the breakfast buffet, which really, you do not have to wake up at the crack of dawn like some people say. Usually though you do have to do it before 10:00- if you aren't up by then, well then too bad. The Asian restaurant---hmmmm not really that good. But you were able to get filled up. The Mexican restaurant we did not get a chance to try. The steakhouse- we did that one twice, my husband absolutly loved that one. The night shows: I really encourage you to attend those, they are fun and humorous- Not always the best show, but still they were a nice touch to our trip. We usually would go and eat supper and then go to the room for an hour and then attend the show and then usually got back to the room for some sleep at about 11:00. We did end up missing the Michael Jackson show, which I was pretty disappointed that we missed it, I've heard it is pretty good, however, my stomach was a little off that night. BUT we did not get sick at all, which was a good thing. The Beach: I had read complaints after complaints about the sand whales, however, it doesn't ruin any part of the beach- as of now, the beach is really amazing, We loved it.... they are pumping sand back up on the beach and that was fun because the sea shells were coming up so there were always people gathered there collecting the shells, even I got a bag full. The sun chairs-- Oh lord, how I read so much about \"You can't get a sunchair if you don't get up at 6:00am... they are all gone by 7:00...blah blah....\" However, I do realize that it is \"down season\" when we went, but always found a chair. Really though, not the end of the world...get in the pool then. Bars: They were all neat and fun to hang out at. The staff really worked hard to get your drink to you like within the second you ordered it, it was pretty amazing. The Staff Overally: They were all very hard working... but every now and then you certainly would see one that wasn't the most pleasant person you ever did meet. We had gotten yelled at a couple times by some for stupid random things, Like sitting in the wrong spot at supper, it was somewhat weird, how they panick if you go to sick in an area that was not yet opened up... but then again the other side that was opened up was completely full, so there where do you sit. lol it was silly... we ended up sitting outside on the balcony for every meal. Oh Well though. We booked our trip through Apple vacations, and to say the least, they were absolutly horrible. No rep showed up until our second last day there, amazing because we were given a list of tours they offered and told to book with them in the lobby, well surprise surprise we would wait and wait and they would no show. We ended up booking with Funjet for excursions, who I might add was always in the lobby booking things for people. So I did have to file a complaint with them because that story does go further in depth, however, I learned... I willl never book with them, honestly, not even if they paid me! lol We booked 2 excursions. 1. Xel-Ha: Beautiful! Breathtaking, very fun! I recommend it. 2. Jungle Jims ATV tours: That was a blast, Amazing tour guide-- He encouraged everyone to have a blast and get wet and dirty.... Very Fun! I recommend this as well. ALL in ALL, Loved the Riu Yucatan--- Also, the location of the hotel is fabulous!!!

We had a fantastic time and would happily recommend to Hotel to family and friends. We have stayed in Mexico once before, so this this was our second visit to an amazing country. The Mexican people always do there country proud. They are some of the most friendliest genuine and hard working people Ive ever came across. We have always felt very welcome in this country. The Riu Yucatan Hotel was great as well. Food was always very good, with so much choice each day in the main buffet at breakfast, lunch and dinner. Its difficult not to eat yourself silly!....the steak house and Mexican restaurants were also very good.You have to book for these at breakfast. Food at the pool side buffet each day was also good. It's crazy to think people have complained about the food in previous reviews. Drinks are great as well, we tried just about every cocktail on the menu, be nice if they served the beer in larger glasses but i'm not complaining. Beach is great, with lots of space for everyone and always easy to get a sun lounger. Its lots of fun messing about by the sea, with free use of canoes, boogie boards, close by. Also jet skis and other motorized water sports in easy reach, but you do have to pay for these. The pool area is also well laid out with swim up bars, kids pool and all the usual trimmings. Its a little sad people would get up at god knows what hour to reserve a sun lounger by the pool...so if you like to be by the pool each day be ready for some early mornings. The beach was always kept tidy by the staff. Be nice to have a drinks waiter service on the beach like the other hotel we stayed, as it does get very hot. There's also a self service drinks are by the pool which is a great idea. The rooms were great, could maybe do with a little updating but nothing that ever concerned us. Great to have a mini bar in the room with fresh water and soft drinks, would also have been nice to have tea / coffee as well. Rooms cleaned everyday and plenty of towel art. We tipped our cleaner $10 each week. Evening entertainment was good, a little cheesy but good fun all the same. But there's always something going on. Would be great to have a games room with a few pool tables to give you another option. Trip wise i would recommend X-caret, amazing day out and superb after show. We also did the pirate cruise which was great fun and a speed boat/ snorkeling trip. Had done all the historical sites on a previous trip. Play del Carmen is better sited to all the trips to historical sites than Cancun. its up to you if you tip the staff but few dollars here there wont break your holiday budget. Unlike the UK, you can tip before hand rather than after a service. That way staff remember you, and they always do.

The pool was kept clean all the time but sometimes there was a build up of slight froth (very slight) which was cleaned straight away but we feel this was caused by the scoober divers and the oxygen from the tanks reacting to the chlorine. The beach was out of this world and considering its been through a hurricane and had extensive damage by god they have worked wonders to get it back to an excellent standard and the sand banks are there for a reason and to protect the hotels and beach.

Being able to swim up to the bar is great and also having the beach club lunch restaurant right by the sea and pool is really good as it means you can stay in swimwear for lunch.

Trips - we did the dolphin swim at xel-ha, visited xcaret, went to chitzenitza and also the Captain Hook dinner cruise with Captain Jack it was great fun. Also went to cozamol which was very hot and playa de carmen by evening with is very pretty. This holiday is very good value for money and the resort of Playacar is beautiful, I would return, maybe not to the Yucatan I would go next door to the Palace as it had more air conditioned areas, which would keep down the mosquitos and give you somewhere to sit other than your room to cool down. We found Bye Bye very good for mosquitos, but unfortunately once it seems they have bitten you not a lot stops it, I was the lucky one and did not suffer.

Large balcony however no light but to be honest we never used it not like in europe where you couldnt live with out it, it was mich cooler in the room. fridge was stocked with corona, orange, coke,water and tonic you just had to catch him and he would give you diet coke. optics were there we didnt really use them.

Entertainment was good we only saw the same show once in the two weeks and they are really good shows, especially as the cast have been working to keep you entertained all day. the day entertainment is there but there not in your face, water polo, table tennis, football, aerobics in the pool, you can take part or not it doesnt really affect you. Pool well this was the only thing i had a problem with, they looked lovely but were what i can only describe as dirty, sand you expect that your right on the beech but there was like a film on the top i suppose from sun cream i couldnt take my hand out without it being attached to a hair, im not fussy but the pools in greece and turkey were loads cleaner than this. I think another problem was the children drinking there choc milk and strawberry slushes in the pool and we all know what kids are like. however i must say it did seem to improve the second week maybe less children i dont know. BUT The Beach well this was fantastic i hate salt water in you mouth your eyes on your sun burn but we spent over half of every day in the sea the sand bags are so mush fun and make great sun loungers, so who cares about the pool????? We went on one trip Xel-Ha well worth it it cost us about \u00a3150 for 2 this included our waterproof camera and bio degradable sun cream (compulsary) but we had a blast its all inclusive breakfast, dinner and all drinks, you need $20 refundable deposit for you snorkel and extra money for dolfins if you want to do this. we didnt ,watching them was fun enough. but natural lazy river tarzan swings caves to explore just lovely day out. Thompson flight we flew from newcastle with stop off in manchester on the way a bit annoying makes for a long flight but coming home was loads better however i will advise everyone to take there own head phones i know there free but there awful really hurt your ears.

Only other thing i will advise you is if your from england and used to going to spain greece etc and like us normally take 15-10 sun cream well we had to buy 3 factor 30 sun blocks the sun was just burning through our normal cream, eventually got to use it in the second week.

Check-in was a breeze. This was welcomed after a long flight and an even longer transfer service to the resort. On a direct taxi cab ride, the resort is about 45 minutes away from the Cancun airport. If you buy transfers, you probably will have about 6 others stops on your way and this trip will take you about 2 hours --honestly. We paid for the transfers and used them to the resort, paid a taxi to take us back to the airport. Buy direct transfers only or take a taxi. Once you check in, the next set of buildings between you and the ocean is the hotel buildings. We ended up being in the closest to the ocean which was nice to get to the pool, etc. but when the nightly entertainment started, it was quite loud in the room -- you would not be able to sleep for sure. Between the room and the ocean was the pool, food area and then you would reach the beach. I don't think there is a single room that could see the ocean . . . so if an ocean view from your room is what you want, you won't find it here.

THere is also plenty to do outside the hotel, 5th Avenue in Playa Del Carmen is a must for a night out during your stay, especially the Blue Parrot Beach Bar! Cozumel is worth a visit and the ferry terminal is only a 5 minute taxi ride away. Just beware of the bumpy crosing! Take up a couple of the excursions, as there really is loads to see. Snorkelling is a must, and we had a really good day at the Xel-Ha water park. Tlum and Chitchen Itza are amazing destinations also. The activities provided in the hotel are excellent, sea kayaking, catamarans and snorkel hire are all included, and the jet skiing is really good value, and a real must for adrenaline junkies!! We did it 5 times in a fortnight!! The wedding was amazing and all in all, this was one of the best experiences ever, I would definitely return to Mexico (and to the Riu Yucatan) and would recommend the destination to anybody!", "Date": "September 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bracknell, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA lovely stay at the Yucatan\u201d", "Author": "Hairbear99", "ReviewID": "UR19548487", "Content": "My husband, my two kids and I stayed at the Yucatan for 11 nights in August and had a great holiday. We have been to Mexico before and love the country which helps. We have also stayed at Riu hotels before, but not this one. The size of our room was more than adequate for the 4 of us and was very clean. We had none of the cleanliness or smell issues that others have reported. The maid was very good and cleaned to a high standard every day (usually whilst we were at breakfast) and left towel art for the kids 3 or 4 times during our stay, which was nice. We were in block 4 which was very near the pool and beach restaurant, not so near the main building. Although we didn't have much of a view from the balcony (only the Riu Tequila's beach alley really) we liked the position and although we were in range of noise from the shows at night it didn't bother us. Anyone who wants to avoid noise at any cost would be better off in blocks 1,2,3,7,8 & 9. The food was fine, but look elsewhere if you're into gourmet dining. We've had better food at Riu's in the past, but it wasn't a disaster and they try hard. They have a nice juice bar and the breakfasts are good. Of the A La Cartes the Steakhouse was by far the best. I thought the Mexican was OK too but none of us were that keen on the Asian. Imagine Chinese food made by someone in boxing gloves...I'm just not used to my (non)crispy duck in chunks...! The pools were great and the kids liked the novelty of a swim up bar they were allowed to use. The drinks were very nice. From the pools it is but a few steps to the lovely beach. Yes I know it's been eroded and the sand whales are everywhere, but it's still gorgeous. It looks as though efforts to rebuild the beach are succeeding and good luck to them. Good spots for lounging around the pools are hard to get after 07.30 so be prepared to play the towel game. On the other hand, sunbeds were plentiful on the beach and easy to get at any time of day. My husband had a massage at the spa which he said was good and relaxing and good value compared to UK prices. I used the well-equipped gym which always seemed to be empty. At least that meant I didn't have to wait for a treadmill. All in all the Riu Yucatan is a good, well run hotel that delivers on it's promises. It's good value, particularly for those of us from Europe who have to endure a long and expensive flight just to get there. If it was just me and the man I've no doubt we'd opt for a Riu Palace, but with children, who want fun in the pool and on a great beach, the Yucatan is an excellent choice.

Immigration was a nightmare \u2013 2 officers for over 300 people and took over an hour. We finally boarded the coach for a pleasant coach ride to the Riu Yucatan. Check In \u2013 Was very easy, staff came to us in the lobby with a welcome drink, issued our wristbands and provided us with an envelope with our room key, safe key and towel cards. I had emailed the hotel about 2 weeks before requesting 4 rooms close together on the 3rd floor. They replied stating they would try their best but couldn\u2019t guarantee it. I was pleased to find all the rooms were on the 3rd floor in block 7. We were allocated 7318, 7319, 7324 & 7325. Welcome meeting \u2013 Thomson reps gave us information on various excursions but what I thought was a nice touch was that staff from various departments were introduced to us. Rooms - Very spacious, cleaned every day with regular towel art. Fridge was restocked every other day. Fresh towels were left everyday even when we hadn\u2019t requested them. Air-con worked well. There were a couple of occasions when the power went out \u2013 however a phone call to reception and 10 minutes later a maintenance man had been to restore it. Day after arrival we had a phone call from reception asking if everything was ok and if there was anything they could do for us. We had another phone call a week later to check everything was still ok. Food \u2013 Loads of choice at the main buffet, a different carved meat at each dinner, a pasta station, pizza, salads and a choice of Mexican food. Good choice of fruits and desserts. Went to all of the speciality restaurants \u2013 Asian, Steakhouse and Mexican. Asian was a buffet and very good. Went to the steakhouse twice because on the first occasion we were booked on the 2nd sitting and they had run out of sirloin steak! Went a week later on the 1st sitting and told them as we went in that it was our 2nd attempt and we were not disappointed. The steakhouse is \u2018a la carte\u2019. At the Mexican you could choose from buffet or \u2018a la carte\u2019. I personally didn\u2019t enjoy the Mexican as much as the others. At lunch time you could use the beach bar or the main buffet restaurant. We generally went to the main buffet as there was more choice and it was cooler. Drinks - Good service at all the bars by friendly bar staff who liked to have a laugh with you especially at the outside bars. The drinks were not weak! On one occasion my hubby had to ask for some more coke in his Bacardi as it was so strong. The non alcoholic cocktails for the kids are good as well. Grounds \u2013 Beautiful grounds being tended all the time. Loads of plants and local wildlife - saw Iguanas and large rodent like animals regularly and the howler monkeys were around for about 3 days before moving on. Pools \u2013 Very refreshing for a dip, but never managed to get a bed round the pool \u2013 they were generally all taken by 7.30am and I won\u2019t get up early on holiday just to get a sun bed. I wasn\u2019t too bothered though as we managed to get the same sun beds on the beach every day. You could always get a bed on the beach no matter what time it was. We always went in front of the dive centre because there were palm trees were you could get some shade. Beach \u2013 Was much better than I had expected. There are sand bags in the sea that look like whales to protect the beach and they were putting more in whilst we were there. They were also pumping sand from the sea and we could see the improvements it was making. We had a walk along the beach and thought the beach in front of the Yucatan was better than other hotels. Entertainment \u2013 The staff work really long hours and work so hard. There are games on the beach and in the pool each day and the shows they put on are really good. Yes, they lip sync but they put so much effort into the dancing. The movie theme show and Abba show were especially good. There were even fire dancers one night. The kids loved Daniel and Carlos, and Rigo Bob was funny. There was a lack of things to do for teenagers. If they wanted to play pool they had to go across the road to the Riu Tequilla. However, once they had made friends it wasn\u2019t too much of an issue. Weather \u2013 I was expecting more rain and cloud than we got even considering Tropical Storm Dolly passed over us one day. It was hot and sunny nearly every day. We had a couple of downpours which lasted about half an hour each time but it was either lunch or dinner time. Overall \u2013 had a great holiday and would certainly return. I was worried about some of the reviews over the last few months but needn\u2019t have been.

think again its gorgeous! outside excursions we travelled with thomson who i highly recommend and had an array of trips including a pirate one where you sail out mid afternoon on two pirate themed ships which provide all you meals..you get to go snorkelling in the cavern on the trip as well and once it gets dark they have a mock pirate fight, they walk the plank and have fireworks..it sounded amazing though we couldnt go on it due to the fact that unfortuneatly all of the trips were quite expensive. the one we did go on and i am telling you that you must go on if you go during the right season was the whale shark experiance. its something your neve ever going to get the chance to do again and what a thing to tell your friends about! its odd these whale sharks are huge! but so very gentle! swimming with them was an experiance to remember forever! plus there are only about 10 people to a boat so no over crowding. on the boat are one driver obviously and your guide to the whale sharks who swims with you to the whale sharks and helps you keep up! diving we were very lucky at the riu yucatan as they have an on site diving club which do the free scuba demos in the pool, i did this and got a real taste for it so decided to book a few open sea dives. the dive centre is padi certified and are very proffesional about what they do. before you go on a sea dive they take you to the pool and teach you the necessary hand signals and techniques which you need to learn. i booked in three dives as this would give me a 12m padi diving certification., during this i underwent alot of training by my instructor alex who was so passionate about diving and very happy to help and very enthusiastic. we had training sessions in the pool, watched two training videos and had to complete a short test based on the video and the manual in the pack they give you. you then have to demonstarte the skills you learn in the sea.. and what a place to dive!! on all of my dives i saw no less than 4 turtles! and even stroked one! the reef is amazing as well and there are many shelfs and tunnels to explore! i highly reccomend you dive with these talented, enthusiastic and sooo nice instructors! trust me they will look after you! grounds see all the animals wonder around is amazing because you just don't see it here! they have howler monkeys, iguanas, birds and these weird rodent type things that a cant for the life of me remember what they are called! its covered in greenery and trees and you really get the message that they are trying to conserve the enviroment and its great. children before each evening show they would have a 'mini disco' where they would call all the children in the audience up on to the stage to take part in games and competitions. all the kids seem to have such a good time and shows how the hotel really does cater for everyone. also there is a kids club everyday. rooms the rooms all had balconys and were very cool! they had air conditioning and a ceiling fan the reason for this is that if you had your balcony door open the air conditioning would stop as stated in the welcome pack, but your fan would stay on. the bathroom was spacious as was the wardrobe and the safe was large enough to fit all your essentials in. the rooms were cleaned everyday and the minibar stocked every other day with beer, pepsi, water etc. shopping surrounding shopping is great but quite pricey so dont be afraid to haggle they will change their prices! overall weather and place was awesome! hotel and resort was perfect and this was definately the best holiday i have ever had!! i highly recommend this resort and please dont listen to the people who say the resort is dissapointing. we had people like this on holiday and they were the people who were unwilling to try anything new..hence why they didnt enjoy it. if your a a positive and fun loving person you wont want to come back! honestly i will never forget this it was wonderful! =] also at the buffet they always decorated it with carved melons which were amazing!! and i had a go at it! thanks for reading!

How wrong was I. Along with my new wife I stayed there at the start of July for two weeks and we loved every minute of our time. We were greeted by friendly staff on our arrival and we introduced to the hotel and shortly after our room. The room was very tidy, clean. The shower and toilet were clean. All the towels smelled fresh and clean. We had a balcony which overlooked a small garden area. For the next to weeks the room maid kept the room in this condition. The beds were a little hard, however I never had trouble sleeping. The food and drink was very good. There is plenty to choose from, fruit, salads, steaks, chicken, local, etc etc. The other three restaurants have a like selection of food. We were looked after by Totti one of the waiters. He did a brilliant job of looking after us and made sure we experienced many a tequila boom boom! The grounds were stunning and kept very tidy. The pool area was again, well kept and looked after. Some of the lights inside the pool were loose, however, but were sorted immediately by staff when this was pointed out. Don\u2019t worry about the beach. There is plenty of sand to go around. Things have really improved from some of the pictures left on the site. There is a good strip of beach, with plenty of space. There are the sand bags in the sea, and there were more being put in place, but you really didn\u2019t notice them and they seemed to make a playground for some people. Plenty of water sports are available on the beach. Want a private beach, go down the steps from the pool to the beach and turn right and keep walking. After ten minutes you will have a beautiful beach all to yourself We wandered up to Riu Tequila a couple of nights. It seemed more lively, but I think this was possibly down to is being a Club hotel, and seemed to have a greater number of younger people there. We enjoyed having a few drinks at this hotel. All in all. I loved every second of my time their. I really didn\u2019t want to come home. To some up. I would without hesitation recommend this hotel. What I didn\u2019t enjoy was having to share space for the last two days of my holiday with a very small minority of loud, foul mouthed, drunken American males. A few little tips for those who might be like minded. I don\u2019t want to see drunk twenty something\u2019s getting wasted at the swim up bar in the morning, shouting and swearing. I don\u2019t want to hear about your conquest from the previous evening, I really don\u2019t need to see you staggering about the pool area in a drunken mess, trying to be sick in the flower beds. Why do you need to shout when you speak. I shouldn\u2019t be able to hear you at all from the other side of the restaurant. To finish on a positive. All in all. I loved every second of my time their. I really didn\u2019t want to come home. To some up. I would without hesitation recommend this hotel. If you go there, say hello to Totti in the main restaurant for me.", "Date": "July 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cAn okay resort\u201d", "Author": "Bridget1720", "ReviewID": "UR17872011", "Content": "Recently visited for a friends wedding.

Is it a five star luxury hotel with waiter service on a secluded beach - no although some people seemed to think that is what it should be . BUT - the hotel is a great, spotlessly clean beach resort set in beautiful grounds with some of the most hardworking and friendliest staff I have ever come across on my travels. ROOMS: Kept spotlesslessly clean by our maid - loved the little towel animals etc every day. Had no problem with no light in the shower. Yes the beds are hard - we were lucky and had a king size double bed - but we slept OK. FOOD: The food was well cooked and there was always something for everybody. The mani restaurant did lack atmosphere but we always ate on the little terrace overlooking the gardens. Only used the steak house once which was nice. No tummy upsets until I made the mistake of eating in Playa del Carmen! BEACH: I hadn't been to this resort before so I can only base my opinion on the beach as it is now. Never had any problems getting a bed on the beach. I thought the beach was OK - and the sand whales are a necessity. Never spoilt our view - the sea was great for cooling off although the last couple of days we had some rain and there was quite a lot of seaweed in places. STAFF: Thought all the staff were exceptional and a credit to the hotel. But why oh why do some people (of all nationalities including the English) think that being on holiday means you leave your manners behind and forget the two main words Please and Thank you. The number of people who could order their drinks without using eith of these words amazed me. To sum up we loved the Yucatan and would not hesitate to go back or recommend it.

Although I was apprehensive before we went, as I\u2019d read some horror stories, there was no need. We had a fabulous time. Yes the beach has eroded which is a shame but it was still idyllic if you can look beyond the Whales. The whales can be fun but also dangerous. So be careful. I saw several people slip off them and hurt themselves, one young girl broke her arm. The sea also has some strong undercurrents, even on yellow flag days, but treat the whales and the sea with the respect they deserve and you will be fine. They do make fine areas to catch the sun, but be carful that a wave doesn\u2019t knock you off, although this can be fun as well. If you want seclusion, a 10 minute walk to the south will bring you to an undisturbed beach that goes on for miles away from the hubbub of the hotel areas. The weather was great, we had a couple of storms but the rain only lasted for \u00bd hour max, although on the 26th, after the storm it took a little while to clear, but once it does it comes out really hot. The hotel and food were superb. The Mexican food in the main restaurant was just great. We booked for the Asian restaurant, where they served fried ice cream as a desert! and the Steak House which we both enjoyed. We felt the Beach Bar was a little over crowded during the day so we went to the main restaurant, where it was much more relaxed. The Pizza\u2019s and food generally was superb, the stir fry\u2019s were great as well. So much selection, I never knew what to have. The food may have been a little sameish, but with so much to choose from you could always have something different everyday. The staff couldn\u2019t do enough to help, the two Thomson reps were also very good. We had a slight issue in the first couple of days but this was sorted very quickly and efficiently by them and the hotel. All the staff work very hard for long hours and always made an effort to speak to you, but the bar staff were a delight, they always had a smile and were willing to make conversation. The cocktail selection was great, try the Boom Boom, its not on the menu but great fun, be warned, don\u2019t have too many! As we spent our days on the beach we didn\u2019t see much of the day entertainment, if it was as good as the night shows it wasnt half bad. The shows were very good but I felt were spoilt by the entertainment crew miming or lip syncing to the lyrics of Grease, Mama Mia etc. They also had a Michael Jackson look alike who mimed to a very clever backing track. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the entertainment crew could really dance, the head honcho was superb and backed up by some very capable dancers who I think must have been classically trained. The ladies were very good as well!! But why mime to the songs, this spoilt it for me, but my wife just says I\u2019m a miserable old [--]! Oh, one more thing, from 08:30pm to 09:00pm there is a kiddies \u00bd hour, one of the female entertainer\u2019s drove me mad with a constant ohh ohh, from the Odyssey - Lets All Chant track. Once is Ok, but at the end of each sentence, please no\u2026 Perhaps I am a miserable old [--]. There were no problems with sun beds, either at the pool or on the beach. Some people did get up and save beds, Why, I don\u2019t know, perhaps they thought they were getting the best spot, but there were so many of them why bother. Why get up at 6:00 in the morning to save a sun bed, your on holiday! The grounds were very well kept, the birds, Lizards and other wild life is in full view all the time. We visited Xcaret (Sa-ca-ret) which was fantastic. I booked on line before we went and saved my self a packet. I booked the Xcaret Plus which I found good value. (I also booked the dolphins on line). As we arrived early (08:30) we had a guide to ourselves, who sorted everything out for us, confirmed times and make our additional reservations. We would have struggled without him. We did the sea track and swam with the dolphins. As we got there early we swam the underwater river by ourselves, great fun and very relaxing, but boy is the water cold when you get in! One word of warming, it\u2019s a long swim, 600 m, so make sure you get a life jacket that fits correctly, ours didn\u2019t and rubbed us both raw under the arms.

Pool bars where good, plenty of drinks flowing! Beach was nice, smaller than i imagined but this is due to sand bags as the beach is being washed away, there are massive sand bags in the sea which at first we thought didn't look that nice but in the end it was great to have them as you could sunbathe on them with the waves crashing into them. Food wasn't fantastic, not alot of choice, mainly stuck to the freshly made pizza as 6 people out of our party of 8 had upset stomach's, talking to people on the complex they had the same, we were unsure if it was down to the food, ice or if there was a bug going around, went to the chemist on site who prescribed us some tablets which were great and sorted the problem out within a couple of days. Weather was excellent apart from we had a tropical storm which lasted the whole day, when it rains it rains, you are best to just jump in the pool as you get soaked trying to avoid it. Disco at Riu Tequilla was a real disappointment as it smelt of sick everytime you went. 24 hour food was just a fridge with burgers, pizza, hotdogs & sandwiches that you warm up yourself in a microwave, not what we expected at all.

I travelled with my parents and overall we had a brilliant holiday. It was our 4th visit to Mexico and we were not disappointed. We travelled from London Gatwick and although the flight is long and tedious the entertainment on the Thomson flight was very good. There was a varied amount of movies, tv shows, games etc to choose from. However, the option to upgrade your entertainment package for \u00a35 is available if you wanted a better choice. I opted to do this as I wanted to see 27 Dresses; I also got access to the cd collection and could subsequently make a playlist to listen to. Thomson has heralded their in flight meals as being inspired by Aldo Zilli. I wasn't over keen on the outbound meal (italian beef sausages with tomato sauce) but that is because I'm a pork sausage girl myself! The meal returning was chicken with asparagus and cheese ravioli which was far nicer. My only criticism on the flight home is reserved for the drunk girls sat behind my Father and I who proceeded to take the mickey out of him for being partially sighted and using a magnifying glass to see the seat back tv. I would have expected the stewards to at least stop ferrying them their non stop supply of alcohol, but hey. They should be ashamed of their behaviour. The transfer to Playacar took roughly an hour. This didn't bother us as it was nice to look at the Mexican scenery whizzing by. The check in at the Riu was smooth and painless. The hotel had already checked you in so the only thing to do was collect the envelope containing your room key, towel cards etc and get banded up. Our room (1101) was medium sized with 2 double beds. As I was sharing a room with the 'rents I was provided with a single bed. The single bed was very comfortable although my parents complained that the 2 double beds were rather hard. The bathroom was spacious with a separate toilet. The shower was lovely, big and a good temperature. The mini bar and liquor dispensers (tequila, gin, rum and vodka) were located in the bathroom. Weirdly, the bathroom was separated from the bedroom area by a curtain. This didn't prove to be a problem provided you didn't need to spend a penny or want a drink while the other person was in the shower. There was a sink blockage on our first day, this was repaired within 10 minutes of reporting the problem. The mini bar was fully stocked when we checked in although all bottles in the liquor dispenser were practically empty. We asked for them to be refilled on the second day of our stay. This was not done so I spoke to reception to ask again for it to be refilled (this happened twice during our stay, especially when the rum and tequila in our room ran out). 5 minutes later, the liquor dispensers had been restocked. The fridge is filled with Corona beer, fizzy orange, 7UP, coke and still and fizzy water. The choice of food in the buffet restaurant was varied, ample and of a good quality. There was a great of choice of cooked breakfasts, continental breakfasts, fruit, cereals etc. My personal favourite was the sunny side up eggs on toast! We ate several times at the buffet, sometimes we were given champagne. We really could not fault the buffet restaurant apart from the staff applauding you upon entrance in the evening. If you don't want to sample the mexican fare on offer you were provided with pizza, fries and plenty of other options. I really liked the puerco pilbil provided on the mexican station. I wish I could cook pork like this at home. My only criticism of the buffet restaurants is the staff are not very quick at relaying tables once other guests had finished their meals. If you are by the pool and want a snack you have the choice of the beach bar restaurant and Margarita restaurant. The typical fare is salad, burgers, pizza etc. I personally liked the Mr Whippy (you Brits will know what I mean) ice cream machine. The only thing missing was a 99 flake! The mexican restaurant was nice but we preferred the steak restaurant. The steak house experience starts with a welcome cocktail followed by caesar salad, a selection of fried foods (onion rings, mushrooms, yummy chicken wings) and soup. The soup is cream of artichoke and tomato which is far nicer than it sounds. The choice of food for the main course is pork ribs, sirloin steak, seafood and land kebabs or half a roast chicken. The pudding is baked alaska. The food was plentiful and my steak was juicy and cooked just how I liked it. We visited 5th Avenue a couple of times and had a meal in Karen's Steakhouse. The fajitas were lovely! We also visited Cozumel for the day and got caught in the most amazing tropical storm. I don't think I've ever been so soaked through to the skin! We shopped and went for a meal at the Hard Rock Cafe. My tip is to get a single ticket to Cozumel. There are 2 ferry operators but by getting a single ticket you can pick and chose when you want to return to the mainland without being restricted. There is not much of a price difference doing it this way. The main reason for our visit was Chichen Itza (my Dad wants to see it before he totally loses his sight). We loved it so much. My recommendation is take a hat, water and sunglasses as it is so hot there. We stopped off en route to visit a cenote and for lunch. Again, try the puerco pilbil, it's very good (sorry all my commentary is food related. I like to eat, what can I say?!). Chichen Itza is last on the visit and you spend approximately 3 hours there. The ruins are so interesting and the guides are very knowledgable. Sadly it is not possible to climb the El Castillo pyramid anymore but this doesn't lessen the enjoyment of the excursion. It is a approximately 2-3 hours to Chichen Itza so be prepared for a long day! Our last excursion was Cancun. I stayed here several years ago with friends and my parents wanted to see it. We got the bus from PDC (air conditioned, tv, toilets etc) bus depot. I think it was $3.60 for a single trip. This is really good value especially considering the cost of public transport in England. The trip took about an hour. We spent time shopping in Cancun's many shopping malls and went for a meal. The buses are every 10 minutes so you won't experience a problem getting back to PDC. The evening shows were varied and yes, they were lip synched but nevertheless enjoyable. If you want Vegas style shows, pay Vegas type prices. My main criticism of the Riu properties is their policy of allowing guests from their other properties to share the facilities. This was very annoying when most days you could not obtain sunloungers by the pool or beach when they were occupied (by the occupants own admission) by residents of the Riu Tequila, Playacar, Lupita etc. Without sounding like a Moaning Minnie, I certainly don't save hard for my holiday to get up at 7am just to reserve sunloungers. It's bad enough that I get up at 6am the rest of the year! We were also fully aware of residents reserving sunbeds but proceeding to visit 5th Avenue for the day and/or reserving sunbeds by the pool and beach so they can get the best of both worlds. Very selfish. The management make a big song and dance about not allowing people to reserve sunloungers but we never saw anything being done to prevent it. The beach is fabulous. Please don't be put off by people complaining how eroded it is. It is still large (by my standards anyway) and the water is still warm and very clear. I was not disappointed. I certainly would have no hesitation in staying at this hotel or any other Riu properties in the future. However, I would restrict my selection to a Riu Palace just to avoid the 'share all' policy the Riu enforces. Please remember though that the airport authorities in Mexico are very strict with luggage weights so don't go mad buying souvenirs, you will pay for it. This happened on our last visit to Puerto Vallarta when it cost a fortune to get home.......be warned!", "Date": "July 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plymouth", "Title": "\u201cA Lovely Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "Roxy831", "ReviewID": "UR17132092", "Content": "We stayed at Riu Yucatan for 11 nights for our Honeymoon, and we had a fantastic time.

The food was very good, we ate in all three of the themed restaurants. The Asian was pretty good, the steak house was good also but we were disappointed with the Mexican one. We thought there would be a 'real' mexican feel to the restaurant, but there was no real authenticity to it at all. The main restaurant was very good, different selection of food every night to try. And well presented. We didn't have trouble with the loungers, we found that by 10am the beds were taken, but before this time you'd normally find a couple together. The beach was nice, a little rough due to Tropical Storm Arthur (4 days of rain, thanks very much!) and they are working hard to restore it. Sea lovely and warm. We went on a few trips, the Captain Hook show in Cancun was good, food excellent and just a good laugh overall. We went to XCaret, which was a kind of water park/coastal zoo. Spent 10 hours there, including the evening show, very tiring but worth it. Take some dry clothes with you, we did a cave swim toward the end of the day and had to sit through the show a little wet which was uncomfortable. We did the Sea-life Plus too, which incorporated a Dolphin Swim, Manatee Swim and a swim with a Sea Lion. Not to mention a stingray (with its tail clipped, so not to worry!!) All three of the trips were booked through the rep, which is a good idea as you have something to fall back on if something should go wrong with the trip. We ate out on our final night, in a place called La Parilla. I strongly recommend this place, superb can only describe it. Its along 5th Avenue, about half way down, opposite the Burger King and Jaguar Restaurants. 5th Avenue was great for shops, real mexican bars, and good restaraunts. Go to the Blue Parrot Beach bar, a kind of club on the beach. Really different, but good fun. And the street that takes you down there is lined with very trendy looking bars.

We (2 adults and 2 girls, ages 12 and 14) spent 11 nights at the Riu Yucatan from 21 \u2013 31 May 2008 and had a brilliant time. This is our 5th stay at an all inclusive resort having been to Varadero, Cuba, St Lucia, Negril, Jamaica (at Riu Tropical Bay \u2013 excellent), and Playa Pesquero, Southern Cuba so we are more likely to make comparisons. 1. Hotel - excellent. Lovely tropical location, well laid out with the pool set right on the beach (Riu Palace\u2019s pool was set away from beach). Lovely, tropical gardens and walkways. Children liked the funny rodents running around everywhere. Also saw a couple of howler monkeys. Maid service good. 2. Pool - great swim up bars, very friendly, funny bar staff and never had to wait long for a drink. Pool nearest to beach was the best, seemed cleaner and colder than the other one. Yes, had to put your towels out at 6.00am to get a good spot which is normal for all the AI hotels we\u2019ve been to. 3. Entertainment staff \u2013 brilliant, especially the hilarious Ricardo who made bingo fun to play! Never met such a fun, group of entertainers who are dedicated to making your stay as fun as possible without being too pushy. Shows in the evening were OK though a bit cheesey, very similar to Rui Tropical Bay but that is what we expected. Have now seen the Michael Jackson show twice! Maybe they need to introduce more new shows? Entertainment staff work very hard. Girls enjoyed the shows. 4. Beach \u2013 stunning. After reading previous reviews about the erosion of the beaches we were worried but nothing to worry about as beaches are still amazing. Yes, the beach isn\u2019t as wide or deep as it was but still plenty of room. The sea is still the most incredible aqua blue colour which you can never get tired of looking at. If you walk 20 minutes to the right of the hotel you come to a completed deserted stretch of beach, worth the walk. Got used to seeing the \u2018whales\u2019 and when the life guards were off duty my girls had fun playing on them, but very slippery and we were told that some accidents have occurred. 5. Rooms \u2013 fine, spacious but agree a bit musty and our daughters\u2019 adjoining room had a rather bad smell coming from the toilet at times. Beds a bit hard, as read on previous reviews, but didn\u2019t worry us. Only minor complaint was that the towels had a strange chemical smell and could do with updating to softer, newer towels. 6. Food \u2013 buffet breakfast, excellent as ever with the egg stations, smoothie stations and everything you could wish for. Buffet lunch OK, plenty of choice. Evening buffet OK, but like any buffet, food can get repetitive. Steakhouse \u2013 great food. Mexican restaurant \u2013 OK food. Asian restaurant \u2013 good, but again a buffet! Good, friendly service at all restaurants including buffet. You have to pre-book for the night\u2019s meal at breakfast but never a queque so no problem. 7. Trips \u2013 were very expensive so we made our own trips up and had a great time. Hired a car and went to the ruins at Tulum (it was too hot to go to Chichen Itza and the girls didn\u2019t want to go) which we enjoyed despite the heat and lovely swimming in the beautiful sea at the end. Then drove down to Akumal and hired a man and a boat for a 1.5hr snorkelling trip. We have snorkelled in Australia and Belize and loved the reef at Akumal and great to swim with the turtles. Excellent man leading the snorkelling trip and as there was only four of us, got to see a lot of interesting fish and reef. Recommend it. There is a dive centre at Akumal where you can book snorkelling and diving trips direct. We saw more variety of fish and reef here than at Cozumel where a lot of the shallow reef is dead from Hurricane Wilma. Second trip was to Xcaret, which I booked online from England and saved 10%. Got a taxi there as not far and had a great family day out. Lots to see and do. Enjoyed the swimming in the underwater river (though no fish to be seen!), boat ride, birds, animals etc. We also went on the Sea Trek which was excellent and well worth doing. Mayan show at end brilliant and very professional. A good day out. Recommended. Our third day out was to Cozumel. We booked a snorkelling tour and a car hire (VW beetle) at Playa del Carmen (by the ferry entrance) to save time. Got the half an hour ferry across and then went straight on to the snorkelling tour. Saw lots of fish and amazingly clear water but disappointed that the reef was dead. Apparently you have to dive to see the spectacular, alive reef which wasn\u2019t destroyed by the hurricane. Then had fun driving around the island in a rather, old battered open-top VW which the girls though was fun. Very spectacular coastline on the east coast and stopped for an excellent meal at Coconut restaurant which you must visit for ambience, views and food. Good day out. 8. Riu staff \u2013 all excellent, professional and very helpful. Always smiling and happy. 9. Kids club looked good, but ours are sadly too old to go there now. Only complaint was that there was no club for 12-18 year olds or for anywhere for them to meet. 10. Good mix of nationalities \u2013 British, American, Canadian, Spanish, German, Italian, French etc. 11. Security \u2013 excellent. Full security check when entering the Playa del Carmen resort and also at hotel entrance. We felt safe with the girls sleeping next door to us.

We had to take our youngest little boy to the doctors whilst we were away and reception staff could not of been more helpful. The rooms were lovely and clean and everything seems to be close to either the main dining room or the swimming pool and theatre. The animation team work very hard to put on quality entertainment throughout the day. The swimming pools are really nice and our boys spent all day every swimming. We were a little worried about the beach after reading previous reports but to be fair the beach was still really great the colour of the sea is amazing although be careful of the under current in the sea as it is very strong.

In the past we have had a great time, the whole package has been a good experience. The Riu Yucatan is awful, in fact we couldn't wait to go home. The beach has been washed away and to get to it is a difficult and dangerous climb over slippery sand bags. No mention of this in any brochures. The sea is so dangerous we saw at least 6 people get into serious and life threatening situations. The life gaurd was useless and the warning signs inadequate. The food was so poor the whole family lost weight and struggled to find anything to eat. The main restaurant is too small and the choice of food is too small. Same food appeared at different serving positions within the same area to give the impression of choice. On arrival we went to the main restaurant to find the only available dish was Ox tongue stew (you can imagine what my four duaghters thought of that) This hotel is a larger than normal Riu (from my experience) but facilities were the worst I'd seen. The main restaurant was too small and as a result meal times were like a rugby match. The whole room reminded me of a works canteen. We booked in the steak house but actually walked out after waiting for 90 minutes and then being served a plate of gristle and grease. What made our stay ever so good was 2 - 300 drunk American and Canadian kids who had never seen a bottle before but made up for it at the Riu Yucatan. Never ending noise and screaming and kids being sick. I actually saw Mexican staff selling adult armbands to under 18's for 20USD The pools were filthy and had electrical fittings with wires floating in the water. I didn't see any attempt to clean the pools. Two of my kids came home with ear infections. Service was generally poor and the rep was useless. Rooms smelled musty and needed refubishment.

We were a little disappointed in the worn down look of the property. The 1st day they were out of clean pool towels and someone had barfed in the pool. Not a great 1st impression! The room was very basic but clean. There were no extra towels or pillows, just the basics. Beds were super hard and uncomfortable. They were kind enough to already have a rollaway bed in the room when we arrived , but this was covered with a worn blanket that was clean but had small holes in it. The ice machine in our building did not work the entire time we were there. In the dining room, they were very efficient and clean, but again the table linens were worn looking and stained. Beach was gorgeous. Yes, they had sand whales to keep the beach from eroding, but it actually was fine for us, since the sea was very choppy and the kids played near the sand whales and we didn't have to worry about them. Food was just OK. Breakfast and dinner had variety, bland yet edible. Lunch was blah. I had to eat a plate of nachos every day since it was the only thing that looked appetizing. And they didn't have any cheese for the nachos, so it was chips and salsa. One night we went to 5th Avenue and ate dinner at Senor Frogs and that was a million times better than anything I had eaten at the Riu, including the specialty restaurants. Entertainment was good. The staff tried very hard to make sure everyone was enjoying themselves. Rigo and Araceli were great. We went to all the shows since we had our girls with us, and expected them to be resort cheesy, but the team did a really good job and everyone enjoyed it.

This is not a huge resort. I liked the small-ish feel. Everything was within easy walking distance. The beach was a bit disappointing. I'm trying to be generous, because the area was still recovering from the hurricane and it showed. Literally. As we walked along we could see sandbags that had been buried along the shore to protect it from crumbling further. I also found the beach to be good and long, but not deep. There wasn't a lot of space if you wanted to be on the beach. The water was excellent, though. Good temperature. The pool was nice. Again, small-ish. Well laid out, though, so there were lots of places around the pool. The food was fabulous. We really enjoyed the buffet and tried all of the a la cartes. The Japanese theme restaurant was the weakest of the three. Our room was very clean and nice. No complaints at all about the room. Especially the bathroom area. Great. We did the snorkeling tour off the beach and that was a highlight experience. Good equipment, good guide. The water was perfect - you could see everything. Good price, too. I didn't find too many other activities of interest on the resort. The water aerobics wasn't a real workout and the water polo seemed to be guys only. What I liked best about this resort was its location to go do other things. For $5 we could get a cab into town to 5th avenue and that was so much fun we went a few times. Great night life. Get a seat at the Tequila Barrel and people watch. You won't be bored. The little plaza/mall within walking distance is really just a bunch of tourist shops - smaller versions of what you'll find on 5th avenue. But there's a bank machine there. Tulum isn't far away. Give Xel'Ha a skip. If you've got kids, it may be worth it, but we (two middle aged women) found it to be a snorkelling Disney. Not authentic. And the visibility in that lagoon is pretty bad. It's crowded, too. Ask about the Go Native tour with AllTourNative. We got to climb Coba (you can't climb the other pyramids), dive in a cynote, rappel down a rock wall, zip line over a river, and go canoeing. Great guide and very exciting experience. All in all, this resort was an ideal hotel to experience this part of Mexico. But plan to get off the resort.

We came with about 35 people for our wedding and had a great time although much of this may have been attributed to the size of the group we went with. The food was just ok. Breakfeast and dinner were pretty good but lunch was slim pickings. I did like that you could visit the specialty restaurants every night unlike Dominican Rius where trips were limited. The beach was eroded but I must say you do get used to the sand whales. It was difficult to swim in the Ocean when the water was choppy as it would push you right up against the sand bags. The beach in no was ruined the trip but if I were to go again I'd likely stay somewhere where the beach wasnt so affected. All of the hotels we saw on adjasent properties heading towards playa del carmen were the same if not worse. The palace, which is newly constucted, built the whole resort up on a breaker wall and made a white sand, palm treed area that looks like it is at level with the sea from afar but when you leave the pool area and go past the artificial sanded area to the water it is the same as the Yucatans' beach The entertainment was usually fairly avaerage unless special guests were brought into the resort. However playa del carmen is pretty happening at night. I would definately reccomend the excersions- Mexico is beautiful and while each trip is around $100 p.p. it is well worth it. The difference between the palace and the yucatan is ; better food, premium liquor served to you in your seat, room service untill 11:00 at night and maid service frequents your room 2-3 times per day. Also the rooms are nicer and the entire building is more formal feeling, they actually enforce the rule of men wearing pants to dinner. I recommend paying for these extra things if you plan on spending a lot of time at the resort and like to eat and drink. Lastly if you plan a wedding there- they do a beautiful job. My only complaint is that there are minimal reception options. If i were to do it again I'd have the ceremony in the early morning then go on a boat mid day for reception. Also, the restaurant for the reception is not private. In all, our family and friends enjoyed our stay at the Yucatan.

We have been to many of places in regards to all inclusive and cruises. I will not compare them to each other because there are too many different circumstances to be totally objective. The Riu Yucatan in a 3 star resort at best. The positives: nice grounds, friendly helpful staff that want to please you, and seem to be happy that you are there. They only make approx. $5.00 per day and rely on some tips. Most people do not understand this or simply do not care. The ocean is nice, but smaller then it was prior to the storm. Plenty of chairs on the beach at any time of the day, but if you want something by the pool, or under the shade, get up by 7:00 to stake your claim. Stocked refrig. in your room daily if thats what you like. House keeping is good and very attentive. Tip them daily it will be worth it to you if you need any extras, ( they will run down the halls for you to make sure you are pleased) . Now the negatives: Food, just ho hum of the same treats daily, done a little differently. If you like hot dogs there are hundreds of ways to prepare this fine dish, just go to the Rui. There so called upper scale restaurants are not even close to a place that you want to write home about, but they try. Beds are springs with a towel over them. Shows were no better that grade school performances, but with the booze flowing most people actually thought that they were watching the real Michael Jackson, (Latin version). Five dollars a ride into town is worth it, who wants to walk in the heat to get at the start of the town which is about 2 miles from the resort, then proceed to walk the 5th Ave strip? There is a whole lot of junk to see in the downtown area. Prices are very high with little room to for deals, unless you want to spend your next 30 minutes doing so. Then when you think you struck up the deal of a life time, the guy next door will sell it for 1.00 less. Food downtown is expensive and so are the drinks. Avoid the Blue Parrot mucho bucks for little to show for it.. Hotel is about 1 hour ride from the airport, thats if you go direct, there may be other hotel stops on the way. Right outside the airport is a stand that sell beers 6 beers for $31.00 American dollars. For that kind of money, I thought I was at a baseball game.To sum it up... look around before you decide where to stay.

I was a bit disapointed in some areas I've read alot of ppl saying it needs refreshing as this is true the hotel is 11 yrs old but is showing its age. A little paint and elbow grease gows along way it is definetly not your modern escape, but well exceeded our expectations from most reviews found here.

Room was fine, no problems with keeping clean, change of towels etc.although sometimes there was a musty smell in room and entrance to reception area. Food was varied in La Hacienda but we were disappointed at lack of choice and atmosphere in speciality restaurants, we tried them all.Dress code for evening was not adhered to for restaurants - this needs to be addressed or omitted from literature. Hygiene was very much a concern - observed guests picking up bread and replacing in baskets even though tongs were provided.Risk of food poisoning ! frightened me to be honest. Hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating - could not fault them in any way. Reserving a bed by the pool was crazy - if you did not get up at the crack of dawn you had no chance.A policy is required as we observed beds reserved at 7am but not occupied until much later in the afternoon.This is very selfish and unfair on other guests. And now we come to the American Spring breakers - they spoilt what could have been an excellent holiday - their behaviour needs to be seriously dealt with - drink spillage causing scum in the pool, smoking in the pool, teenagers being loud, brash,drunk and still being served alcohol.Expecting to be served in Speciality restaurants without booking.We did raise this with the female rep who advised \"this was their Spain\" and they would \"burn the candle at both ends for a few days\" and then settle down.So basically it was put up and shut up.In my view this was not acceptable.We will not go into further detail about the Rep and her views other than to say we did not agree and she was not at her desk when she should have been ( found her dining in the restaurant ) we will be discussing this direct with Thomsons but were not impressed with the rep service provided.

We booked at the Rui Tequila and only stayed there 2 days and we were moved to Rui Yucatan when we requested our two rooms to be closer together. Both hotels has similar grounds, food, rooms and actiivites. The teens like Yucatan because it was closer to the beach. Hubby like tennis courts at Yucatan better. There is something for eveyone - I enjoyed the water aerobics class, teens liked ping pong tournaments, kids liked crafts and spanish class. Rooms were clean, nice and adequate. Asked for mattress pads for the hard beds and that helped tremendously. Had to ask several times for Pepsi Lights but lots of beer and water stocked in the room refig. We spent very little times in our rooms. The grounds were beautful and enjoyed the monkeys in the trees. You definately need mosquito spray at night and keep the screen doors closed. Hotel staff were very friendly and nice - gave lots of dollar tips to ones that we enjoyed but did not see too many other people tipping. The first 3 days the water was perfect and we kayaked, snorkeled, body surfed and jet skied. Then the rough seas and winds came up our last 3 days and the teens could not parasail or do any water sports and were very dissapointed. We hated the practice of the towel saving, people got up at 5 am to save seats. It is vacation, are these people crazy? The beach was a beautiful crystal aqua blue and so very warm to jump in and swim when it was calm. The beach was affected by the erosion but I expected worse after all the negative reviews, I thought it was still very nice. I felt very comfortable and safe in letting the kids roam all over the resort. The food was good, not great but adequate and plenty of it. Something for everyone. Good for a week but would not have wanted it for a longer stay. Hindsight, I should have insisted one night to eat in town. However hubby is the type to say we paid for this let's stay here but our AI price was so inexpensive we could have totally splurged in town a couple of times. Loved the fresh fruit and flan. Breakfast very good, loved the yogurt, muelsix, fresh fruit and teens loved the omlet bar and fresh donuts. Ate at one speciality restaurant, the Asian and it was ok only. Dinner was good with different themes each night. Usually ate the Mexican food and fresh fish. Discovered the pasta bar outside on the patio towards the end of the trip- very good. I loved trying all the different drinks. Mojitos my favorite. One night the girls tried lots of the Martinis to pick our favorite. Chocolate one won. Hubby and son thought the drinks were watered down and had mostly shots of Mexican flags and poppers along with lots of beer. I thought the shows were very entertaining and the activity staff did a great job. All the staff were very friendly and helped have everyone have fun. Most of the hotel guests were European - British, German and Swedish and we enjoyed meeting them alot. Our 10 year old hit it off with a British girl for the stay. I would say we enjoyed our first stay at an all inclusive saying it was like a cruise ship on land - something for everyone, very relaxing, safe and enjoyable.

First off, the reviews about fighting for pool chairs is correct. I have never been to a hotel that had such problems. We got up at 7am and barely got chairs, I heard people saying they were up at 5am! The main reason I think is because the all the Riu's have access to it and there's just too many people! The beach was ok, that's not the hotel's fault. The service was great, staff was nice. Shows were great. We were there Thursday to Sunday and got Rocky Horror Picture Show and Michael Jackson in concert. Food - the pool area for lunch was not good. Pizza and fries were the best on the menu, at least when it didn't have hot dogs cut up on it. You heard me right - hot dogs on the pizza and in the soup. We tried the Mexican specialty restuarant and ended up eating in the buffet inside, Hacienda I think. It was better. Plenty of choices and if you're picky they have made to order spaghetti.

Although this happened to coincide with American 'Spring Break' which meant the hotel was completely full, on the whole, we had a good time. The Riu Yucatan is based in Playacar which is a purpose built resort which is made up of various hotels as well as about 4 or 5 Riu hotels. The flight and transfer with Thomson was painless and we arrived at the Riu Yucatan after dropping people off at various other hotels including the Riu Tequila and Riu Playacar (both of which you can visit and use the facilities in with your wristband on). The Yucatan is, in our opinion, in need of updating. It had a kind of 'shabby' feel to it and it was definitely not as up-market as the brochure would have you believe (more of a 3 star than 4). The main problem for me was the fact our room smelt very musty and all the towels smelt of a kind of mildew/musty smell even the new ones which were left after our maid had cleaned the room. This smell seemed to permeate around the room and our clothes started to smell and even once we got home to the UK, I had to wash everything we had taken (even if we hadn't worn it)! This really was the only gripe we had with the hotel and other than that, we found the beach to be gorgeous. Yes, there are sandbags but after the fist day, you don't seem to notice them - you still get the feeling that you are on an exotic beach and the sea is the beautiful turquoise colour that you only see in the Carribbean. The food is not bad. We ate in all the a la carte restaurants and these were ok although not a la carte in the sense that you can order off a wine list and choose your starter/dessert etc (there was only a choice of about 5 main courses). We would highly recommend going into Playa Del Carmen - it is only a short taxi ride away and we did this a couple of nights in search of some more exciting food and a bit more culture! Would highly recommend Casa Del Aqua Restaurant, it is fantastic with great food, an extensive wine list and a great atmosphere. The other Riu's are not much different to the Yucatan although the Riu Palace hotels (which your wristband won't get you into) are a more upmarket offering from the Riu group and people we met who were staying there said they were very nice. All in all, we had a good time but it wasn't the romantic trip we had hoped and we were bitterly disappointed with the rooms. For a bit more money, I'd stay somewhere like the Palace or the El Dorado chain, just make sure you are near to Playa Del Carmen for a good night out and a change of scene!", "Date": "April 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "belleville canada", "Title": "\u201criu yucatan warning\u201d", "Author": "redheadtraveller53", "ReviewID": "UR14841998", "Content": "I was at Riu Yucatan March 28th to April 4th 2008. Sunquest never informed us that the beauttiful beach of a year ago was basically gone. It has been badly eroded and the water is full of sand whales that are awful looking. Sandbags are also all around the stairs and sides in an attempt to shore up the beach. it is dangerous and is no longer a place you can walk peacefully from one resort to another. The other major problem with the riu properties is the \"stay at 1 and play at 4\" philosophy. The problem was we paid far more than people at riu tequila, riu playacar and riu lupita and yet all these resorts were allowed to come to our resort ( a 5 star) and use the beach, pool, lounges and restaurants. This meant we paid FAR more money only to be completely cramped by the other riu resort vacationers. In order to get a lounge anywhere we had to get up ( remember we are on vacation here) at 5 and 6 am to simply put towels on chairs to reserve. Mostly riu tequila people were the problem as their resort, for which they paid significantly less, had no beach. The resort was across the road and so they used our pool and our beach. This all means that a resort designed for 550 people and was fully booked, was actually trying to deal with more than 1,500 people. It does not make any sense to book at the riu yucatan and pay quite a bit more when you can stay at riu tequila and just walk over and use the riu yucatan facilities. We actually had heard that the dinners were better at the riu tequila, and we were not technically supposed to use the other resorts for dinner but we did go one night and the dinner was far superior to ours. I know from selloffvacations I could have booked riu tequila for 890 versus the 1227.00 I paid at the riu yucatan. On the postiive side, the staff at the riu yucatan are amazing and wonderful. The a la carte restaruants excellent ( packed with riu tequila people however who should not have been there). The property was spotless and staff were always cleaning. The last day the toilets all backed up and there was no cold water so many of us had to have scalding hot showers as we tried to be ready for our long flight home to Canada. In conclusion, don't book at the riu yucatan. Either book and pay the extra at the riu palaces ( equally bad beaches)but far superior in every way including no need to ever get up to get a lounge reserved, or book at the riu tequila for far less money and enjoy the priviliges of the riu yucatan. Something needs to change as this was a ridiculous way to have to spend your vacation getting up at the crack of dawn to get a chair that we had every right to in the first place. In actual fact, I would not suggest this area anymore due to the need to get up at the crack of dawn to get a lounge chair, fighting the crowds from the other rius properties and the awful beaches. Go somewhere else for sure! Hope this helps to alert you to beach situation and the sharing riu properties do which looks good on paper but is in reality not a fair situation for those who paid more to stay at a 5 star resort. annoyed from canada", "Date": "April 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, WI", "Title": "\u201cNothing special, but still a good vacation\u201d", "Author": "autum23", "ReviewID": "UR14832351", "Content": "We stayed at the RIU Yucatan from 2/14-2/20 as to attend and be a part of my best friend's wedding held at the resort. We were part of a group of about sixty people, friends and family, of all different ages, experiences, and expectations. Some people loved the Yucatan, while others were not so impressed. I was one who was not so impressed. Overall, the Yucatan is a nice all-inclusive resort. My boyfriend and I are in our mid twenties and easy going. This was our third trip to the Riviera Maya, and we will be returning soon, but not to a RIU. So, here are my thoughts on the Yucatan. My first priority when booking a vacation is the beach. Unfortunately this beach has seen better days. It is very much eroded from the horrible hurricanes of the past few years. Because of this, the beach is reduced to a small strip. About twenty or so feet into the water the resort has created sand barriers as to help keep the beach from further eroding. These are really hideous large algae covered eyesores that we all called \u201cwhales,\u201d as they resemble large beached whales. The beach is very crowded, and there is no shade cover. I did always find a chair or two but I did have to search. Many people were up with the sun to save chairs near the pool or beach, but I was willing to take what I could find. If you walk down the beach away from the resorts, there is a beautiful beach with soft sand and very few people. You have to lie on your towel, but it\u2019s quiet and absolutely gorgeous! One other note about the Yucatan beach is the amount of topless women. Just be aware that you will see a lot of them of all shapes and sizes. Overall the beach is crowded, eroded, and beached whales take away from the areas natural beauty. The rooms are very average. The beds were very hard and the pillows are very thin. The room has two double beds pushed together to create a king bed of sorts. The showers have great pressure and temperature, but there is no light. I didn\u2019t like not having a light or a fan in/around the shower. Things smell a bit musty, but we always bring a glade plug-in to defeat that problem. The safe in each room is a metal box bolted to the floor of the closet. It was interesting, but nothing was stolen, as it is operational. The mini-fridge is always restocked with soda and water, which was greatly appreciated. For those of us who would rather be outside than inside on vacation the rooms are just fine. The food at the resort was a major disappointment. This included the dinner that was served at the wedding reception. We enjoyed breakfast a lot, but the rest of the day was really poor. I ate a lot of guacamole and chips, pizza, and ice cream. There is a lot of variety at the buffets, but nothing was great or really stood out. We are not picky eaters, but on vacation we like to indulge and enjoy our meals. This is very average food. You will by no means starve, but you will not enjoy yourself either. The resort is well maintained and clean. The front desk is helpful and efficient. They do a good job of taking care of as many guests as they deal with daily. The bartenders do their best but are not overly friendly. The drinks are very weak, but people still found a way to get \u201cloose.\u201d There is plenty to do if you need entertainment. The pool area gets a bit loud with games and contests, but if this is not your thing, head to the beach. Overall we had a good vacation, but we will not return to the RIU Yucatan, as I prefer a larger beach that is \u201cwhale\u201d-free with either more chairs or less people. Many of our friends that vacationed with us thoroughly enjoyed themselves and would return to the Yucatan in a heartbeat. I hope this review helps when considering this resort.

The location of the hotel is also just a 5min taxi drive into Playa Del Carmen. BUT do not go there during Spring Break or if you specifically are looking for a beach holiday! I stayed there with my husband and my husband's parents between 12th March and 26th March 2008 which happens unfortunately to coincide with USA Spring Break fortnight. The hotel got extremely overcrowded and very noisy. When the hotel is at 100% capacity all inside and outside public areas are just full of guests and it is difficult to get tables in the lunchtime restaurants and to get loungers around the pool we had to get up before 6.00am. During the day the swim-up bars in the pool area were full of drunk and noisy American teenagers and every night there were at least a couple of incidents of noisy drunkenness and swearing and shouting on the paths outside our rooms during the early hours. The management in the hotel are aware of the problem and seem to try and sort out issues as they happen but the Mexican people are very laidback about these things and seem afraid of bringing in any 'ground rules' which could have helped to avoid some situations occurring. When we first mentioned the noisy and rowdiness to the reception staff we were told it was 'Spring Break!' implying that guests are allowed to do anything to enjoy themselves even to the detriment of other guests enjoyment! The other major problem with this hotel and others along this stretch of coast is that the beach is just disappearing - even during the time that we were there part of the beach had disappeared in front of one of the row of steps leading from the pool area down to the beach leaving a 4 ft drop! There are sandbags to fill the gaps but even I found it difficult to get down to the beach. I was aware when I booked that there was some serious erosion down to the hurricane but I really didn't expect to see the beach in such bad condition. The reduction in the size and accessibility of the beach probably adds to the congestion around the pool area. In the Thomson brochure this hotel is described as a 'tropical paradise where you will feel like you have died and gone to heaven' - unfortunately this is not what I found at the Riu Yucatan when I stayed there. After several verbal complaints and finally a written complaint over the course of several days we were offered a move to the Riu Palace Mexico which was next door by Thomson. This hotel was quieter and had move room for everyone, we stayed here for our final 6 days and finally felt that we were on holiday. I am sorry that this comes across as a very negative review - I'm sure that if I visited the hotel another time of year I may well have had a better experience. I have never complained about holiday accommodation in the past but feel that future guests do need to be aware of the issues myself and my family experienced.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cYay for the staff at the Yucatan\u201d", "Author": "londonsunshine", "ReviewID": "UR14551166", "Content": "This was our honeymoon we arrived March 2nd for 2 weeks.

Yes, it was spring break but if you're not the moaning type looking for an excuse to complain you will find that all the children were terribly polite and were having fun, not causing trouble or disrupting holidaymakers. The hotel itself is fabulous, perfect location on the beach, close to Playa Carr (2min walk) for emergency pharmacy/souvenir shopping, close to Playa del Carmen (40min walk, 5min taxi fair - $5) which is beautiful, friendliest staff i have ever come across, great facilities and yummy yummy food. As an 'early morning female jogger' i loved that the hotel itself is set within a 'hotel zone' of approximately 10hotels with holiday homes in between which has pavements both sides and speed bumps every 1/2 mile, it made me feel extremely safe and i didn't once feel nervous about walking at night by myself. The beach is eroding slowly BUT if you have ten minutes and your not lazy take a 5minute stroll on the beach (walking right) and you will come across a 1 mile stretch of completely deserted beach, it's breathtakingly beautiful. There are no loungers or parassols but there are palm trees and large rocks that provide shade. The staff are amazing and with a wide variety of activities ranging from spanish lessons to dance classes to water polo available they are friendly enough to ask if you're interested but also understand that if you say 'no thank' you mean 'no thank you', they do not pressurise you to take part. The food is fabulous, with a wide variety for all the family, i especially liked the fresh fruit smoothies for breakfast and paella for dinner. I thoroughly recommend the Jungle Crossing trip which includes snorkelling on the reef, kayaking and underground river swimming, absolutely amazing. You must visit Playa del Carmen, once you get past the McDonalds, Starbucks and tacky souvenir shops you get to the traditional restaurants set in quiet alleyways with local artists and boutiques all surrounded by fairy lights and cobbled streets, very beautiful and romantic. Over all the holiday was all i could have wished for, yes some people would argue it's not 5* but the holiday is what you make it, if you're looking for things to whinge about it doesn't matter how hard they try you'll find fault but if you like a fab hotel, friendly staff and wonderful weather in beautiful surroundings i would definitely reccommend the Riu Yucatan.", "Date": "March 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire", "Title": "\u201cRiu Yucatan/Spring Break\u201d", "Author": "pambuckingham", "ReviewID": "UR14487836", "Content": "We stayed from 4th - 18th March and couldn't wait to get home.

The Yucatan was no exception to the excellent reputation the RIU has established. I read many reviews on TripAdvisor before booking at the Yucatan and must say that we didn't have problems like other guests listed previously (musky smelling rooms or lack of water - no problems at all.) I carry a small spiral notebook with my when we travel to that I can take good notes, and here are some of my notes from Yucatan Feb 2008: All customer service staff that interact with guests speak English. All RIU rooms have a safe and you'll want to keep your valuables, including your passport and tourist visa, in the room safe. If you lose the safe key, it\u2019s expensive to get them to reopen it so keep it with you at all times. The Front Desk also issues \"towel cards\" that you trade for beach towels at the towel hut near the pool/beach. When you return the towels at the end of the day, you get your cards back. Same with these: you don\u2019t want to lose them. There's a gift shop across from front desk in lobby sells postcards and postage to mail postcards to the USA. You can mail postcards at the drop box at the front desk. The gift shop is a bit pricey for souvenirs; wait and shop in Playa or at the Cancun airport when you are exiting the country. Rooms The rooms are nice. All air conditioned with either a balcony or deck. Do not drink the water out of the room facet! It\u2019s not potable \u2013 meaning fit for consumption. I don\u2019t even brush my teeth with it. Face washing is okay. The ice in the ice machines in each building is also good to use as is the ice at the bars/restaurants. It\u2019s just the facet water that\u2019s not potable. Beverage service Every two days they check and fill your mini bar. Each room has a small refrigerator and they keep it filled with big bottles of water. Drink this bottled water or purified water you get at the restaurants (including that in the soft drink dispensers.) The refrigerator has soft drinks, a couple of Corona beers and mixers for the liquor in the mini bar. It\u2019s not the greatest quality of liquor but its okay. Same with the bars. You can request a drink with a more premium brand and they\u2019ll do that (see the bar menus). The beds are AWFUL. Really hard. (Jamaica RIU's are the exception by our experience.) So are the pillows. We bring our own pillows and small air mattresses because after a few nights, you\u2019re sore. You can request an egg crate mattress from the Front Desk and you\u2019ll want to do that after a night or two. Tipping Tipping on the resort is not expected but always appreciated. We take some US $1\u2019s and $5\u2019s to tip staff. We usually have 4 big pieces of luggage and so we tip the bellman who helps us to the room \u2013 especially if your room is on the second or third floor, as our was this time. Housekeeping will come each day, unless you post the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign. We usually leave a couple of dollars every other day or so with a note that says the money is for housekeeping; otherwise they won\u2019t take money just sitting around. You can spend either peso or US, venders will take either. We usually take both as you can get a better deal with peso. Generally, take smaller US bills. I found $20\u2019s too large unless you're paying for larger items. Restaurants/Bars Breakfast \u2013 there\u2019s one restaurant \u2013 La Hacienda \u2013 adjacent to the lobby that\u2019s open for breakfast. It\u2019s self-serve buffet but wait staff will bring you coffee in a pot and clear away dirty dishes. Just like the USA, they request that you get a clean plate or glass if you return to the buffet Lunch \u2013 La Hacienda is also open for lunch. However, we were always on the beach in the day so we ate at the La Margarita next to the swimming pool. It\u2019s also buffet. Dinner \u2013 La Hacienda is also open for dinner. They have \u201ctheme nights\u201d like Italian and Mexican. Like all RIU's, this resort has reservation-only dinner restaurants. The Yucatan has three. You have to make reservations that day and they begin taking reservations at La Hacienda at 7:00 a.m. We are up early so we ate at all three restaurants. Steak House \u2013 This is the best one of the reservation locations. I had the kabobs and it was the best dinner I\u2019ve had at a RIU resort. This is a sit-down, service restaurant so we tipped $5. Mexicano \u2013 This is also good. It\u2019s half-buffet and half-service. So we tipped $2-3, depending on whether we had a cappuccino. The Asian restaurant was mediocre; don\u2019t wait your time if you have a better option. The restaurants serve beer (Corona on tap) and wine (red, white, rosa). If you want a cocktail, it\u2019s best to bring with you to the restaurant from a bar. I believe that by staying at the Yucatan, you also have reciprocal privileges in the evenings at restaurants at the RIU Tequila and Playacar. We never did this. Bars There are five bars: lobby, two by the theatre area where they nightly entertainment, one by the beach and finally, one in the pool. It\u2019s cool to sit at a bar stool in the pool and have a drink. Towards the end of the vacation, I tip the bar staff who have been serving me. They work really hard and even as busy as they are, you never have to wait long for a drink. My favorite drinks are Tequila Sunrise and Sangria. They make the sangria with wine, lemonade and two flavored liquors. It\u2019s really good. Another good one is Chandi \u2013 a mix of 7up and Corona (or another beer). Beach The recent hurricanes did a number on the beach. It\u2019s okay but damaged. You\u2019ll see where they\u2019re trying to rebuild it in places. Water sports are available from Scuba Carribe on the beach. My husband sailed on a small catamaran sailboat nearly every day. Sailboats are complimentary; wave runners are available for a fee. Activities You will get bored if you only stay on the resort. Here\u2019s what we did: Excursion \u2013 Mayan Adventure Snorkeling Tour This was about $72 per person for a \u00bd day of snorkeling at three locations: a cenote (see-notey) sink hole, a cavern and an inlet. It was good. We take our own snorkeling equipment but the fee includes renting theirs. I think they give you the face mask/air hose at the end of the time. This includes a nice lunch. We looked into the two water parks \u2013 Xcaret (ish-carret) and Xel-ha (ish-el-ha) but decided it was too pricy since we only wanted to snorkel. I hear that Xcaret is really nice though if you want a water park. The resort has brochures. We also did a short snorkel trip with the beach water sports company, Scuba Carribe, located on the resort property. Playa del Carmen The city\u2019s tourist section is a 5 minute taxi ride/20 minute walk from the resort. We went to PDC about 4 times. Taxi is $5 US one way; they don\u2019t expect a tip since it\u2019s such a short drive. If you want to walk to PDC, do it early in the day or later. At mid day, it would be quite hot. Ask the driver to drop you off at the Paseo del Carmen \u2013 near the Ferry. There are a lot of street venders selling their wares along the main street \u2013 5th Avenue. They will shout at you to come into their store. These venders barter for the price. If you ask how much something costs, you enter into an unofficial \u201cdrama\u201d with the vender and should barter for a lower price. They expect this. For instance, if they say something is $20, offer $10 and settle for $12. The original price they tell you is usually about twice as much as you can get it for. Be prepared though: if you ask about something, they will do their best to see that you buy it and try to find a price you\u2019ll agree to. Personally, this exhausts me and I prefer the vendors with fixed prices. I bought chocolate and coffee at the General Market near the bus station in PDC. You can also buy items at the airport in Cancun on your way out of the country. Look around before buying souvenirs because you may find is cheaper down the street. PDC has many restaurants on 5th Ave. No cars are allowed on this street; only pedestrians. There\u2019s live music at night and lots of people. We really enjoyed it. Restaurants in PDC: For Mexican food, we recommend two: La Parrilla (5th avenue and 6th); this has a balcony area and good food. It\u2019s a popular restaurant and quite busy. The other is El Oasis. This is more off the main path @ 12th St between 5 and 10. It\u2019s good food at an inexpensive price. The restaurant also has a unique wash basin outside of the restrooms that\u2019s worth noting if you\u2019re there. We had a drink in PDC at a little bar right before 5th Avenue called Trecate. It (like other bars) has swinging wooden seats like a swing set. From PDC, you can take the ferry to Cozumel. It\u2019s a bit expensive: $44 US roundtrip for two people. We were disappointed in Cozumel \u2013 it was a sleepy version of PDC. The ferry ride was enjoyable. So, we had a great time in Playa and at the Yucatan. Suggestions for packing: Take a few ziplock bags - a smaller one to put your room key/safe key/towel cards. These bags come in handy. Insulated coffee mug - since the resort is all-inclusive, you can fill your mug with whatever: coffee, soft drinks, alcoholic drinks. It reduces the number of times you have to get up from the beach chair. The bartenders will happily fill these for you at the bar! Extra water bottles - since the room water isn't potable, having a small empty water bottle is nice to either take to the beach or use to brush teeth in the room. Squirt bottle - I always take a small water \"squirt\" bottle to cool off at the beach/pool. This is a great way to get some water on your skin if you're sunbathing.

It was raining when we arrived but the transfer went smoothly and our keys were waiting for us as we got off the coach. It absolutely poured down on the first day we were there and looked like being a very dull week but after that we had fairly constant sun. The beach was ok but the devastation caused by the weather has meant a series of huge sandbags, that looked like dead whales, in the ocean.

Anyway this was until the 'highlight' of the week when a drunk 'lady' knocked on our door (well banged and kicked it) after midnight insisting we let her into 'her' room. When I opened the door to tell her where to go she grabbed me around the neck, drawing blood, before realising I wasn't who she was expecting (I am not sure if she was disappointed or not!). I then managed to walk her to her correct room to find her boyfriend/husband asleep on the floor outside their room. After kicking him in the head (he didn't wake up) she proceeded to try and kick the door in. At this point I made my exit.

As expected, the hotel was exceptional in every way. Accomodations: We stayed in block 5 main floor which is perfectly positioned near the beach and pool (probably best block of rooms). The rooms were clean and the sheets were changed regularly. Tiping to the maid ensured that there were no shortages of towels or bottled water in the room. Tipping should be done at the beginning of the week (a sampler) and at the end. This ensures that things will be to your liking from the very beginning. Food/Beverage: The food quality was excellent (alittle repetitive which could be a negative for those who eat as though it were their last meal). No one in our party experienced any major gastric problems. The Hacienda was the main dining buffet lounge with ample variety easily satisfying the most picky of pallets. There were theme nights with slight changes. The steak house was good with a very nicely sized choice of steak. The mexican was also good, the appetizers/salad bar could easily be the meal. The asian restaurant was buffet style with pretty good sushi (remember your in mexico). Tiping ensures that as time progresses, your dining experience gets better and better. Near the end of our stay, we found our table prepared for us nightly with balloon animals for our daughter and wine for the adults. Tiping large isn't required, repitition works best. There are many bars to choose from all equipped with bartenders that work quickly and happily. Santos in the pool bar works incredibly fast and never seems to get upset even when some obnoxius vacationers yell out there drink orders out of turn. Beach/Pool: The beach is under attack from the elements. As you are aware, recent bad weather has caused deterioration of the beach area. The installation of very large sand bags (for lack of a better word) have been installed on the beach to combat the erosion. Pumps were seen pumping sand back on to the beach which seemed to work over time. The pool is quite large (2 in total) and very nicely shaped with lots of room for swimming. There is a sectioned off kids pool area that is more than enough. Reserving of chairs around the pool area is normal and necessary especially if you have kids. Some people seem to complain about this but it is these same people who sleep in until 9:30 am and then expect to find two perfectly positioned chairs for their enjoyment - get a life and quit complaining, in the morning it is fair game for everyone including you. Entertainment: The nightly entertainment was nothing spectacular but it never is no matter where you go in the caribean. The entertainment group works hard to keep people moving but they will also leave you alone if your not interested. Excursions: We've traveled to this area before and seen the sites. I am sure they haven't changed. Airport: Arrival was painless but departure was painful. Do not overload your luggage as you pay for the extra weight to a tune of $10/kilo. Our luggage was weighed along with the carry-ons and we were 8 kilos over. Interestingly, once you enter the gate area you are overwhelmed by all the shops and all of a sudden the \"baggage weight issue\" is irrelevant.

When looking at these hotels, please keep in mind that a 4 or 5 star in the Carribean is not the same as 4 or 5 stars in New York, Paris or other major western cities. If you want that level of hotel/restaurant in the Caribean look at the Ultra deluxe resorts like Sandals, just be prepared for the price tag that comes with it! Hotel Grounds and Staff: Very lush gardens and well maintained, staff works very hard to keep it clean. Staff was always friendly and smiling. Would help when ever you asked as best they could.

They are very friendly and will keep you entertained if that is what you want or leave you alone if that is what you prefer. The kids club was great. Lily was great with our daughter and she loved being there. There was a little to much freedom to come and go if then kids are too young but for her it was great. The kids disco every night was a real hit with our daughter. When we ate in the buffet we stayed in the same area for breakfast and dinner and got the same servers for each night. A little tipping goes a long way as while they were always friendly to everyone regardless, they always seemed to remember what we drank, pull out our chairs for us, etc. nice little touches for a buffet. Food: Was very impressed with the food. It is an all inclusive so if you are expecting a 4/5 star restaurant you would get back home you are going to be disappointed but there was good selection available and the taste was mostly very good. Very North American meals compared to other AI's I have been to. Ate at the Mexican and Asian and both were good. Sushi at the asian was great and there was a nice selection at the Mexican. We had three different meals between us and my wife and i enjoyed all three. Rooms: We stayed in a regualr room in building 2 with two double beds pushed together. Not a lot of room but sufficient. We were disappointed they did not have a cot or rollaway style bed for our daughter as it would have made sleeping easier but c'est la vie... no big deal. The rooms were well cleaned and restocked every day for us. Only did one trip - chichen itza - don't let them tell you it is a shorter drive because of the new highway, still a long day on the bus but a fabulous site to see if you like history. We were told Xel-Ha and Xcaret were both great trips as well. If you want to shop make the trip into 5th Ave in Playa Del Carmen. there are some great deals and the vendors are not nearly as aggressive as in the Dominican.

It is a private company & we had a private tour. We were picked up at our hotel & then driven to Tulum where the office is located. We got to tour the Tulum ruins, zipline through the rainforest, snorkel in an underground river system (VERY cool), swim/snorkel witht he sea turtles in Akumal & the snorkel in a lagoon with millions of tropical fish!!

After 11 hours on the plane, I was dreading a long wait to check-in. No such problem.

We were than given an envelope with our name on it, clearly marked with room number, containing door key, safe key, towel cards (for beach or pool) and label to put on our cases for bell boys to deliver to rooms. Room was fine . . . if I was nit-picking I would have liked tea/coffee making facilities for early morning or when you return from pool or beach prior to going out for the evening. Food was delicious and plentiful. Lots of variety, be it for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Sampled the steak house once, quite nice. The Mexican resturant was not to our liking however, completely devoid of any atmosphere. Back to The Hacienda after that, where we could eat at our pace, and completely please ourselves. Usual problem with the sunbeds by the pool. Must confess to becoming an early reserver myself, because playing fair is great if everybody does it, but if you didn't join in, you missed out! The bar staff were fantastic, especially Donas, Abraham, Eduardo and Israel. Two thirds of the way down a brandy and another was there waiting. Animacion staff worked hard and the shows were of a better standard than we have experienced before. Lastly, the monkeys did not come out to play as often as we would have liked.

The rooms were very clean and the maids were very polite and very quick to bring you anything you needed. We had our wedding there and got the Royal Wedding Package. The resort really took care of everything. The wedding was set up on time, the flowers arrived to our room on time, and dinner was wonderful.

We walked over to the Riu Tequila at night to go to the dance club. That resort seemed to have a huge nightlife. The Yucatan had shows every night and there were activities to do during the day.

Myself, spouse and 4 year old son! We were located in Room Block 9 (Behind the main lobby). It was really quiet... we had requested that....and a bit of a walk to the pool/beach... but this was okay considering the fact that we ate so much... a little exercise did not hurt! AIRPORT We flew WestJet from London ON... Sunquest was the tour operator...Confusing when we got to Cancun! Sunquest was not that organized! They also changed our flight time from 7am to 2pm... and it seems that no one elses travel agent was advised of the change in the time... and no one got a good excuse why it was changed!!!! Cancun Airport...It is a really busy place! Especially if you arrive at night! It was a one hour drive to the hotel from the airport... Leaving was a much better organized experience! I love flying Westjet... great crew.... seatback TV (kept my son very happy!!) Lots of leg room for 6\"3 spouse! Loved flying from London... no long walks through terminals... Home 1 1/2 hours after landing!!!! GROUNDS The grounds were beautiful with lots of interesting vegetation. Everything was clean and neat with constant maintenance being done. The layout was easy to figure out. The creatures were interesting to watch! We had a few monkey sightings! Staff were always cleaning bathrooms, lobby, etc ROOM Was smallish - but that would be the only major complaint... Fine for two people... but we also had our son with us...We did not spend a whole lot of time there anyways! It did not smell musty in the least! I had brought air fresheners but did not need them! I would recommend bounce sheets for the dresser drawers though... The balcony was nice to sit out at night and enjoy a corona! We requested and received extra towels (always replenished), extra hangers, extra pillows and a blanket (which was huge and warm!) Maid service got a bit sloppier as the week went on... oh well! There could be a few more towel hangers and perhaps a drying rack inside the room. Hair dryer worked great... although I managed to short out the power a couple of times! again.. not a big deal! The shower was VERY CLEAN... and we had no issues with the shower head... loved that we could move it according to height! Our friends stayed in block two and said that it was not noisy! Apparently the hotel was overbooked at some point mid week and several people were offered an upgrade to one of the Palace Hotels... dont think that any of them had children!!! haha! FOOD/RESTAURANTS We LOVED the main buffet at la Hacienda... always lots of variety... ate every breakfast and all but two dinners there...always tons of choice... and yummy! My son especially loved the ice cream station! We ate at the steakhouse second night. easy to get 6:45 reservation... and it was not full.. the steak was okay... very thin...I ate some of the deep fried appetizers (and totally regretted this later - should have known better!)... the soup was soooo good... the best thing about that meal... also came with a salad for starters... You can ask for frenchfries instead of the baked potato... overall review of steak house... so so! There are other options other than steak...(pork, chicken) but we both got steak... so I cannot comment on them... Our son was soooo tired he passed out at the table!!! the waiter brought him a second chair... and he slept through the entire meal! Asian - ate there one night... I enjoyed it... lots of good sushi... the rest of my party thought it was so so compared to Hacienda! Mexican... unfortunately due to the 3000 weddings that took place during the week we were there... we could not get a reservation!! it appears that most of the wedding reception parties are held at this restaurant... makes sense... beach view... however... I was disappointed that we could not get in... Our friends tried to make a reservation at 6:50 am on Friday the 18th... no luck! okay... so maybe not 3000 weddings... but there were a lot of weddings!!! Pool Buffet.. opens at noon... and my son was first in line for the self serve soft icecream!!! again... good variety of food... yummy french fries... the fish was good too... and I got my fill of guacamole! There was always something available to eat somewhere!! POOL we enjoyed our time by the pool... Friends of ours showed up on the second day we were there (we did not realize they were travelling here) They were early risers and managed to score good seats every morning... it does seem that you have to place towels out WAY before 5 am to get the best seats!!! and you know what... EVERY place I have ever stayed at... the best pool loungers are taken early... just a fact of staying at all inclusives! We always found a shady area (for me!)... so that was fine! Liked the swim up bars in both pool areas! There are not a LOT of activities that we partook in... spouse played water polo... Anamacion were the LEAST annoying of any all inclusive I have ever been at!!! If you wanted to participate... you could easily do so... and they left you alone if you did not wish to participate! KIDSCLUB My son would not stay by himself (he is on the shyer side)... nor would I let him after I saw the set up... It was more geared towards older children! The Anamacion staffperson Lilian was very nice and patient! However... she did let the kids come and go as they pleased... which is fine for older kids! She tailored the activities to what the kids wanted to do... the schedule is pretty flexible... It is not a \"daycare\". There was a climber and sandy area with a volleyball court... We sat and watched some of the activities and Lilian was fine with letting us use the games, toys, etc... I would have no qualms leaving an older child at the Kidsclub... The kids disco at night was very cute! My son watched for two nights that we went and geared up the courage and headed up on stage the third night! They do about three songs... then a game (pinata, musical chairs, etc) There were a couple of little girls (about two or three)... who stole the show every night!! BEACH... there was a beach! It is sad to think what it used to be like!!!! Lots of sandbags to get down to the main area... We spent some time at the beach area.... lots of room always... and chairs were usually available when we got there or shortly after! we were able to build our sand castles and frolic in the waves... the water was amazingly warm! It was a bit rough a couple of days... just saw the Jan 13, 19th photos posted in another review... sad... We did not go down to the beach area on the 19th as we left fairly early... You cannot walk very far along the beach without seeing areas that are really badly eroded... and there are not many shells... They appear to be really trying to fix it... but who knows... Other travellers we met who had been there last year said that it was way worse than a year ago... This is something I would clarify with your agent prior to booking if you are a total beach lover... we were happy with some time at the beach and the majority at the pool People seem to love the \"sand Whales\" that they are using to combat the erosion... they jump off them or slide off of them! TRIPS Our daily trips were to the pool... and the beach! very cost effective! We did head to the Tequila to watch the football game on Sunday... at the sports bar... they had sandwiches, nachos and you could microwave hot dogs, etc... Did not really explore the resort though... Went shopping in to Fifth avenue... very interesting and you can satisfy your starbucks cravings there! I was in cozumel about 14 years ago... and we took the ferry across to playa to do a cenote trip... WHAT a difference! hah! It was a shock! people we met went to Tulum... said that they spent a lot of time either picking up or dropping off other people at the other resorts... so I would ask about that first! We had debated dragging a four year old on a day trip... then decided against it! and did not regret it! OTHER... I think I would have \"toughened\" up my feet a bit prior to leaving!! Wearing sandals again... new blisters! but they were fine by day 3!!! The walkways are brick... again.. a little tough on the feet! Spouse hit the gym and said it was good... it was very close. We did paint ceramics... that was fun and my son lasted much longer than I thought he would!!! Bugs... mosquitos appeared after it rained... we brought off skintastic bug spray but did not have to use it every day... someone said that the beach was full of bugs... did not find that to be true... We thoroughly enjoyed our week! Staff were always friendly and accommodating...I would recommend this hotel especially to families... as there were a lot of kids there!!! Not sure about the nightlife as we generally did not experience that past 9pm!!!

Anything involving fish and seafood was some of the best you'll ever have. The Riu Lupita next door is designed for younger travellers who want to party all night, but that hotel is not right on the beach, it's right behind Riu Yucatan. This means that the Riu Yucatan is great for families, older travellers or larger groups who want to be close to the party but not necessarily right in the heart of it. Enterntainment every night is quite good and your agency will suggest some good tours and excursions to consider. I did some looking into this and you won't save any money by trying to book things on your own, they're the same price and there is always the risk that it's an unproven provider. Just go with what the rep tells you at the hotel. It's a short trip to Playa del Carmen which has a boutique shopping area and restaurants for you to kill some serious time in. Everywhere you go you can buy questionable pharmaceuticals at a special discount price, I would not buy my heart medication in Mexico. Tequilla on the other hand is quite cheap and readily available.

The food was good but the restaurants was very crowded and we had to wait for 1.5-2 hour to find a free table. The reason why there were so many people was simple: they have another resort RIU Tequila which doesn't have it's own beach and many people (I guess best part of them) spent their time in RIU Yucatan. The room service seems to be average. It looks like they don't clean rooms every day, at least they didn't do this in our 1st day even we left some tips. On the second day, they cleaned our room about 4pm. The rest of our vacation, :) they cleaned our room every day and very early (I guess because of tips we left). So, my next vacation (this December) was spent in IB Tucan which is near RIU Yucatan, and I was shocked when I saw the RIU Yucatan's beach! It's destroyed. Only 1(sometimes 2) row of the beach loungers (those that were closer to the resort area) were on the beach. The rest of the beach with the palm trees was washed away and the stuff was trying to fix those trees they could. Hopefully they will be able to do something to fix this problem but when?", "Date": "December 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portsmouth, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cReview of 2nd stay -- June 2007\u201d", "Author": "mgampp", "ReviewID": "UR11608683", "Content": "This was our second stay in as many years at the Riu Yucatan.

We have been to the D.R. and the Bahamas so we decided to try Mexico for this trip. We were looking for a warm weather site with golf, snorkling, and a spa available to us. We were also looking for a great value for the money. After much research, we decided on the RIU Yucatan and were not disappointed. The nearby golf course was terrific. It was expensive ($190 but with unlimited food and drink including a gorgeous restaurant overlooking #18) and difficult (slope of 132 from the white tees). It's a must play for an avid golfer because the layout and course condition were both excellent. My wife headed for the spa when I played golf and she said that it was first-rate. Our experience was different than some of the more negative reviews that we read before our trip. Some of our reactions: 1) We ate at all three specialty restaurants and the main buffet. We found all to have very good food even excellent at times. The food at the Asian restaurant was superb even though it was buffet style. The sushi was as good as any I have had in the past. Don't miss the fried ice cream which you must order from the waiter. 2) The cleanliness of the room and the beauty of the grounds and common buildings was suprisingly good for the price of the hotel. You can stay at better resorts but you will pay much more to do it. We found the Yucatan to be very upscale for the price. 3) As advised by other reviewers, we took bug repellant but never had to use it. 4) We were a bit apprehensive about staying at an all-inclusive for the first time but we never encountered loud, obnoxious behavior. 5) The only negative that I would offer about the RIU Yucatan is that the beach has eroded away to almost nothing. However, this is true of many of the Playacar resorts. The water line is just below the pool deck and there is literally about a four foot drop from the narrow upper beach down to the lower beach. Each beach level is only about eight feet wide below the pool. The upper beaches on either side of the pool go back a hundred yards or more and there are many palm trees for shade. The water is very clear and warm. If you can get past the beach erosion, it really is a very nice place to lounge around and swim. The pools are very nice and refreshing too. 6) Some advice: U. S. cash is accepted everywhere...take lots of small bills for tips, small purchases, etc. because any change that you get will be in pesos. You might want to minimize the change that you get by using small bills. And most of all...do not try to do Tulum and Xel-Ha in one day. We did and felt that we were short-changed by not spending the whole day at Xel-Ha. If you are in to water fun, don't miss Xel-Ha.

This was our 7th trip to Cancun/ Playa del Carmen and it was great. I was a little concerned that the Tequila was not on the beach but when I saw how the 3 properties were arranged I saw there was no reason for concern. I read many positive reviews leading up to our trip and then just before we left, I saw several negative posts. All I can say is that some people are very hard to please. The food was great, period! I ate way too much but that is my fault. The drinks were great, period! They were very good, served(at any of the 14? bars between the 3 Rius that we had access to ) very quickly. The bartenders were nice, funny and fun to watch. They whipped those drinks up FAST! During any of your meals you are free to draw your own Corona beer or white , rose or red wine. However,the wine was not a very high grade...oh well. The rest of the booze was. The grounds were clean and well maintained. The rooms were clean and well mantained. They are a little small, but I did not go there to sit in a room. The room did smell a little musty but we had brought candles. My main complaint is that the beds are HARD and I mean HARD...no kidding or exageration here...HARD. The beach? The turquios water?...great. One of the Riu beach properties is in the process of rebuilding the beach. They are pumping a sand/water slurry into these huge bags in the water to stabilize the beach in the event of future storms...I guess. Interesting to see...it murked up the water in the area. If it bothers you just walk to the left (if you are facing the water) about 200 yards to the other Riu property. There is some walking involved no matter what you choose to do as the properties are huge. They do have a shuttle that carries 8 at a time (including the driver) to the beach. The shows are marginal but I am usually worn out by showtime. We did see one at the Tequila that was pretty funny...a spoof on musical acts. We did not participate in any of the acivities available such as volley ball bingo aerobics ect...many did though and enjoyed obviously enjoyed it. My only other complaint was that our departure bus picked us up at 7:05 am...I know that is not the Riu's fault but that really ticked me off. I guess they have to give themselves plenty of room for error and we had more that enough time when we got to the airport. In sumation, good food, good drink, good service, visually pleasing and hard beds. Would I go back to the same place? Yes. I might bring one of those little self-inflating back pack matresses.

Definetly not a 4 or 5 star but a 3 +. Our room was average size, a small shower with mold. Clothes and blankets felt always wet because of the humidity there. People were very friendly but dont expect to much effords. Food of the buffet was always the same every single day. And also not best quality. (Salad with bugs, vegetables not well cooked and tasteless also not very hygienic. A better look at the (clean) dishes did the rest. The steakhouse restaurant was okay but also nothing special. Reservations have to be done in the morning at breakfast. Although it is not allowed to make reservations for the couches at the beach and pool area there was already everything reserved with towels or shoes at 9 in the morning!!!!!!!!! Also there is mostly not an inch between the couches... The shop at the hotel is small but you can get almost everything you need for a real expensive price. I had a cold and bought some pain relievers for a lot of money and they took the half out so be careful. The beach is almost gone because of the hurricans, and they dont do much to save it eighter. But the palace next door is not much better, they only have huge sandsacks and rocks that makes it impossible to swim there. You can get to playa del Carmen with a taxi for 5 $ and there is a beach you can really lie on. Palm trees fell in the beach a lot of times. We prefered to rent a car and drove south where the beaches are still natural. We did the Xcaret which is really beautiful but too expensive for what you get. The most beautiful place where we also found huge shells was on isla mujeres. This is a very tiny isle but very beautiful. You get there with a ferry or a passenger boat from cancun. We also visited Cancun which has a lot more to offer regarding bars restaurants and shopping as Playa del Carmen but there is also more tourism what we not wanted in the first place. The beaches there looked more intact than at the hotel. The ruines in Tulum are nice but you cannot go into or on it. The beach there is beautiful but again a lot of people.

We arrived to the most humid weather we've ever experienced, it was like a blanket enveloping you, as we were driven to the hotel it started raining, as we entered the hotel grounds it had stopped, as soon as i got off the coach i was bitten by a mossie, so apply sprays etc at the airport before you leave! We had a quick info talk with one of the managers, a cocktail and our AI band attached to our wrist and keys, towelcards etc given to us. Found our room, which was a decent size, lovely big bed, very comfortable, asked for 2 extra pillows though as didnt have enough, this request was noted and done very quickly. Lovely air con, which was needed, also a ceiling fan. Lovely big wardrobe with hangers. Only problem was that the shower had no light, so once you drew the curtain it was a tad dark! No mildew smells or anything like that, a very nice room all in all, nice view of the pool and partial sea from the balcony. Now onto the food, we ate in the buffet restaurant a few times, for breakfast there was a wide range of stuff, cereals, smoothies, toast and jam, cooked stuff, although some of the stuff they offered for breakfast made me look at it quizzically, nachos with cheese and spicy sauce, cooked chicken in a sauce, pork in a sauce, amongst eggs, bacon, scrambled eggs with peppers in, only one day they had sausages and another day hash browns, they didnt have these everyday? Lunch we had in the 2 restaurants by the pool, food was ok, nothing spectaular, the thing is you got bored with it because it was the same stuff every single day, no variety. Dinners at the buffet were ok, but no variety, we ate in the steak restaurant on the night of my fiance's birthday, this was lovely food and service, they decorated the table with balloons, candle, petals and glitter, all the waiting staff sang happy birthday to him and then bought out a big birthday cake, all for no charge, obviously we gave a tip! We also ate in the Asian restaurant, food was average, not like chinese food at home, the best bit was the dessert, deep fried ice cream, oh it was heaven.!! The only thing that ruined the holiday a tad for me was that i got crippling stomach cramps, where id be doubled over in pain and always rushing to the toilet, i thought it was just me but we got chatting to a few other holidaymakers and they too were suffering with them aswell, which means it was the food or drink that was doing it, so if you have a sensitive stomach, take loads of immodium, as these were $18 for a box of 6 out there, extortionate!! The grounds were kept very tidy and clean, saw the peacocks and the guinea pig/bear things, my fiance saw an iguana, no monkeys though. The pool area/beds were ok, had to go down early and put towels out to save them, even though signs said this was not allowed. The actual pool was ok, a few tiles missing here and there off the bottom, when we first arrived the pool was relatively clean, but as we got to the last 2 days of our stay the pools were to be honest, filthy, in the jacuzzi there was a build up in the middle of dirty mucus, hair and god knows what else! In the main pools the water around the swim up bars was dirty, things floating like a plaster, dark long hairs and insects and just general muck, on the last day i didnt actually get in the pool cos it was that dirty, i asked for a pool cleaner to attend and give it a good clean but this didnt happen. The beach was gorgeous, the water so, so blue, it was lovely, very warm too like getting in a bath, take bread rolls from the restaurant and feed the fish, absolutely amazing!! The entertainment was a little poor really, it was all very much the same every night, mayan dancing and costumes, which once you've seen one you've seen it all really, not much else to do of an evening other than watch the show or drink at the bar, could do with more evening entertainments really. The bars were great, the pool bar was fab, Armando and his Miami Vice cocktails were lush, my fave one!! The other bars were great too, the bartenders are very good at their jobs! We went in to Playa Del Carmen one evening, $5 in a taxi, it made a nice change from the same thing at the hotel, the only thing i didnt like was every shop we passed we were hassled to go in, it spoilt it a bit for me. My fiance done parasailing which he thoroughly enjoyed. Telephone calls home were very expensive, one phone call lasting a minute was $13!! It rained one time during the holiday, early evening, but was over as soon as it started, then rained just as we got on the coach to leave, the rest of the time it was absolutely baking, very very hot!!

The reception staff were helpful and welcoming. The room was lovely and clean and quite spacious. Most days was a different bit of towel art. The lady who cleaned our room was lovely, thank you Marlene. The beds were nowhere near as hard as I had read about. Slept well every night. No musty or damp smells. Had a huge beetle thing one day but Marlene sprayed the room for us and left a can of Raid in case it came back. It was our wedding anniversary while we were out there and the reception staff sent us a lovely congratulations letter and a bowl of fruit. They also rang a couple of times to see how we were. So sweet. I was really worried before we went, reading the reviews from people who had stayed there, all I can say is they must be really hard to please. The buffet breakfast and evening meal was great, always something to keep us all happy. Lunch in the restaurant by the pool/beach was good too. We booked several times for the Steakhouse, highly recommend the ribeye!! The mexican was great too. Only went once to the Asian and that was good for a bit of something different. The Thomson reps, Petra and Benny were so friendly and helpful. We booked the dolphin discovery, Chichen Itza and F1 speed boat. The dolphin trip was out of this world, we swam with them and manatees and a sea lion, well worth the money. Chichen Itza was HOT!!!! but again worth seeing. TIP... don't sit in the seats in front of the toilets, the leg room seemed to be less than the other seats. My husband and his friend did the F1 trip and said it was fantastic. They snorkelled with turtles and saw barracudas and sting ray. The hotel and grounds were so pretty, lots of wildlife, did see a monkey but didn't have camera!!! The little guinea pig/rat animals are cute and love to eat fruit. Iguana popped out for a stroll around the pool one day. There's also a peacock. Now to the sunbeds.... never had a problem though the hotel wasn't at full capacity when we arrived and was getting busier as our 2 weeks went on so it could possibly become one. The beds by the beach always had spare ones no matter the time of day. Slightly disappointed that the main pool bar wasn't open when we were there, but probably saved us a few hangovers!!! We had a few bites from the mossies but as long as we sprayed we were ok. Did see some people with nasty blistered bites, the reps recommend \"OFF\" available in the local shops, we took Jungle Formula, maybe we were just lucky. We met lots of great people though some nationalities were exceptionally loud and could be quite rude too. Don't think please and thank you, were in their vocabulary, which was a shame as the staff were fantastic, especially Fernando and Jose at the tequila bar. They were constantly on the go making sure that everyone had a full glass in front of them, and they work such long hours but always happy and smiling and ready for a laugh. Brilliant guys. Sadly for me, there were a few sporting events on when we were out there and I was abandoned for the football, rugby and grand prix, which can be watched at the Sports Bar at the Riu Tequila Hotel across the road. You can visit most of the Riu hotels and have lunch and drinks there as part of your all inclusive if you fancy a change. Entertainment was interesting most nights. The animation team worked so hard, and were great fun. The main lad, \"loved his job\". You heard this from him quite a few times a day!! Didn't get involved in the daytime activities, tho my son did and had a whale of a time. Went into Playa del Carmen twice, only 5 dollars each way. Loved the yellow submarine bar, only got there the once tho. Very friendly in there, kept asking us what songs we wanted playing. Drinks were good value, be warned they were strong!!! Second time into town, we were going to have a mexican meal and ended up at MacDonalds!!! There wasn't the hassle from the shop assistants like we experienced in Egypt thankfully.

Once we got to Cancun and through immigration and Customs we took the ADO bus from the airport to Playa and then took a $5 taxi from the bus station to the hotel. It was very easy, cheap and safe. I would suggest taking the ADO if you want to save some money like we wanted to. It cost us $40 total for transportation going there and back. Upon arrival, the hotel was clean and looked amazing! We were greeted with some corona and check in only took about 5 minutes! We were in our suits and to the beach within a half hour! The grounds are well kept and our rooms were cleaned daily with the mini bar stocked every other day. Keep in mind that the little fridges in the rooms are stocked with warm beer, pop and water. If you drink everything in your fridge and it is re-stocked it might be another day before the new beers and things are cold. We thought our fridge was broken but it turned out that ours was re-stocked right before be arrived so we had to wait till the next day before our things were cold. No big deal - good times! the rooms did not have a musty smell although we saw a few little ants on the floor one day - no big deal either, good times still!! The beach was awesome and there was plenty of room for everyone all day long. It was hard to find room around the pool usually but you just have to roll down to the beach and all was good! The beach isn't as big as it has been in the past but it still doesn't take away from how cool it is and how much fun sitting there all day long can be. We did do the dreaded \"beach chair save\" most days, just because we were a group of six and wanted some prime spots - haha! Lot's of topless women (which was great for us American men!) we don't see that much here. Keep an open mind about it and roll with it. It's not our custom in the states but to others it is their custom. The food was great and there was a lot of variety for everyone's taste. We didn't make any reservations for the other places to eat because the buffets had more than enough and were very good! We tried out the Playacar one night for dinner and it was good as well. We actually snuck in because they usually don't let you eat dinner there, just breakfast and lunch. one of the waiters told us that we weren't supposed to be there but he wasn't going to tell - good times - ha!! We went to Xel-Ha for a day which is well worth it, just bring comfortable shoes because its more walking than you may think. 5th ave. downtown is very cool and you can find lot's of great places to eat and drink for a very low price.

And from my friend's comment (who has traveled to Mexico numerous times) there were more topless at this hotel than she had seen at others. Apparently, it is usually allowed on the beach but not by the pool - here at Riu Yucatan - it was permitted at both. The buffet food was okay. First vacation ever that I actually lost 4 pounds. Breakfast was probably the best out of the three although we did eat at the Asian restaurant and thought it was very good. We went over to the Riu Tequila across the street and thought their buffet was a little better. We were five women traveling together and never felt unsafe, went into the town several times and shopped. My one tip for shopping might be to dress down. We went out shopping one evening after dressing up for dinner and a shopkeeper made the comment that we looked like we were big spenders because of the way we were dressed. So we might not have gotten as good of deals that evening as we had other times we went into town. Somewhere we read that you should pay about 1/3 of the price of what is initially quoted...we never got down that low..I would say most of our purchases ended up about half price...but still walked away feeling that we got some good deals. We did go over to Cozumel one day and actually thought the prices were a little better over there. I would highly suggest that you bring the money you want to spend in small bills rather than using a credit card.

The people in the restaurant couldn't do enough for you- and when they are being assessed everyone gets champagne! Which is really great, something which is rare. The food quality is good, with lots on offer and the drinks menu is so long it is hard to get through all of them! The rooms are average, and the air conditioning is a down side to the Hotel, but there is a ceiling fan which makes the sleeping temperature okay- you are neither hot or cold when sleeping. The lobby area is large, and reception is in a nice stting, However as with most areas in this hotel the air conditioning in the lobby is inadequete. That is the only downside to this hotel. Wearing jungle formula is a MUST without it you will get bitten! The animals in the grounds are there, but as we weren't really interested in them they didnt bother us. In the grounds there are peacocks, iguanas, monkeys and small torque creatures but none of them pest the guests. Overall the holiday was really good- we were moved by Thomson early one morning to some Motel in Florida- my advice is do not travel in Hurricane season to Mexico with Thomson as they move you to accomodation much worse, and ration both food and drink.

The food is actually better then average and we found that the best place to dine was at the buffet rather than the a la carte restaurants since everyone could find something enjoyable to eat. The rooms are good size and kept very clean. The minibar is restocked every 3 days but should you need anything sooner you can make a call to the front desk. They are more then happy to accommodate. The towels are replaced daily. We did not spend much time at the pool, only the last couple of days since the waves were too rough for the little ones. However there is daily entertainment and the pool WAS clean. The chairs with shade both at the pool and at the beach had to be reserved early (before 8am). The beach was beautiful and the water was clean and calm. As mentioned earlier, only the last couple of days of our stay, the ocean waves were too rough, as the hurricane was fast approaching. The guests from other riu hotels were allowed to come and use the facilities which did make it a little crowded at times. Also, the entertainment is great. During our 2 week stay we did not watch the same show twice. The coolest show is the Mayan performace. 5th Avenue in Playa del Carmen is less then a 5 minute cab ride (50 pesos). There are tons of restaurants, shops, lounges, bars etc. It's really nice to be able to get out of the hotel and change the environment a little. Overall we are very happy with our stay.

I actually found it strange that other reviews cited musty rooms and pest problems, as we experienced nothing of the sort during our stay. Our room was very clean. There was a mini fridge, which was stocked frequently to our specifications, and four bottles of booze in handy dispensers. The beds were quite hard upon first inspection, but we both slept like babies every night. There was even a drying rack on our balony for wet swimsuits. We stayed on the third floor of block 1......near the lobby so it was pretty quiet. I'd avoid the rooms near the pool- too noisy. During our stay, we dined at each of the reservation-only restaurants (the asian one twice), and didn't have to get up at 7am to get a reservation. The mexican restaurant had the nicest view, being situated right on the beach, but the food was not as good as the others. The buffet was pretty decent. There was a little something for everyone, and we sure never went hungry! The coffee/espresso machines were heaven, though they kept running out of milk. The pool was very clean, but a bit too warm, which wasn't a big deal since we opted to enjoy the beach as much as possible anyway. Although we heeded others' advice about rising early to reserve lounge chairs, we found that throughout the day there were plenty available for the late comers. Plenty of water activities were available during the day. Hubby and I took a small catamaran out for a spin one morning. It was free, which was nice. If you plan to drink on the beach, bring an insulated mug. It did get tedious traipsing back and forth from the bar for refills of the tiny cups they put everything in. We also booked a couple of day trips- Jungle Jim's ATV Adventure, and the Catamaya snorkeling trip. Both were awesome, however I did get quite seasick on our catamaran ride to the reef. Once in the water, I was OK though. Shopping in town was also quite the experience. The cab ride into Playa Del Carmen was only $5US and it was tons of fun checking out the little shops. Shop around for the best prices and haggle, haggle, haggle. Most places were charging $30+US for Mayan masks, and we ended up finding one for $18.

Our rooms were a good size, a little old and dusty but we didnt want to complain as the service and buffet restaurant were great. We went to bed that evening satisfied that we had made the right decision with the Yucatan. I feel now that I must write a realistic review of what we discovered the following few days. The pool was cloudy and dirty with very few sunbeds. We found sunbeds our first day-we had 2 four a family of 4- only to discover after lunch that the family next to us has thrown our belongings onto 1 bed and taken our second. The pool was packed! Lunch at the buffet was horrible. It was too overcrowded, the tables were dirty and flies everywhere! The plastic cups we were given for our drinks smelt as did the pool bars. It seemed as though all the people from all the Riu's decended onto the Yucatan. The beach is beautiful. We found ourselves on the second day unsure about what to do. We were at a hotel that had the most friendly and helpful staff we had ever experienced but these small things were making our stay difficult as we have 2 young children. We decided to ask the Thomson rep about an upgrade to the Palace but she couldnt do it. We then approached (sheepishly!) the front dest and explained about the sunbed situation around the pool and they were very understanding (which made us feel even worse!) They moved us to the Palace on our third day without any questions. Again the staff at the Yucatan were fantastic. If you are looking for a beach only holiday and do not have young children, you will be fine. At the Palace there was waiter service, at bars and around the pool, the pool was clean and not at all overcrowded. The service was no better but it was less stressful as only Palace clients were allowed. I do not want to alarm people who have booked but inform you of what to expect.

The attendants were very friendly.The backseat TV are brilliant, but i would recommend you upgrade while on the plane to entertainment plus, this gives you more movies, TV shows, CDs and a play/pause function. This makes your flight fly by (No pun intended). When we arrived at Mexico we were quickly wisked off to our hotel, in actual fact it took about an hour and a half with stops. As soon as you arrive at the hotel you have a little talk off a represntative telling you all you need to know. Then you get the key to the room and you're sent off. Scared!!! Yep we were too, the resort is quite big and to find your room you'd think is impossible but a map is included and there are sign posts everywhere. The rooms are basic all you really need. The minibar is restocked every other day and is ample. The only fault with the room is that there is no light in the shower but it wasn't too bad. Towel art is waiting for you most days and room is always cleaned excellently. The pool is very nice, clean and quite warm. The beach is very clean and is busy but if you get up early you will get loungers. The sea is very salty and rough, which can be fun at times when people fall over as the waves crash against them. The animation team is wonderful they always want to make you have the best time. The shows in the night are also very good and you can see that the animation team put a lot of effort in. Food in the hotel is wonderful lots of choice. We only tried the mexican and Asian and these both were lovely. The steakhouse too is supposed to be nice but with 2 vegetarions we didn't try it. I do advise however if you cant hold your drink don't have Tequila Slammers, let's just say there were a few hangovers. Altogether I thoroughly enjoyed my holiday in Mexico especially in this hotel and would recommend going to this hotel to anyone because I know I want to:D", "Date": "August 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Romford, England", "Title": "\u201cOur second visit in two years\u201d", "Author": "Utd1963", "ReviewID": "UR8282005", "Content": "This was our second visit in two years as we enjoyed ourselves the first time so much that we had to return. This year we came 11th July for two weeks bringing our friend and her family. These are my comments on our holiday, Hotel: Last year we were thrilled at how clean and tidy this hotel was kept by the wonderful staff, this has not changed one bit. Food: One restaurant change to last year and for us it was for the better the Mexican was a real treat. Theres plenty to chose at the buffet and no need to eat the same food each day the choice is massive. Bars: Great entertainment with the staff, get them to mix you a few local shots if thats your thing The Mexican Flag was one of my downfalls !! Pool: Yes the small pool is too warm the larger one is a little cooler but walk off some of that breakfast and just down the few steps at the end of the pool area is a cool inviting blue sea. As for reserving beds, last year you had to be up at 06.30am to get a sniff, this year you could still get a bed at 09.00am it just depends who's on holiday in the hotel with you that week. Beach: Yes it is half the size of last year and the beds are crammed together a bit but if you have never been before you wouldn't know unless you read this. If you want a wider beach take a cooler bag and walk to the left of the hotels about 1000 yards, this section of beach is empty and away from the crouds. Depends what you are looking for. Trips: We hired a car from the hotel lobby area and did Tulum, Coba and the caves of Atcu Chen in one day this worked out very in-expensive compaired to the reps costs. The girls did the Dolphins and us lads did the Quad bikes, these were great for the cost of $45 but do request an early trip. No gripes as such, we did have a few niggles with the room but they were delt with prompt by the staff and not worth going on about. As its July and viewed as the rainy season we did get a couple of storms but they passed quickly and were a great spectical to view out over the sea. One storm was so windy that it blew down a palm tree on the beach, within one hour six men came to the beach, they dug out a hugh hole and re-planted it. Hows that for service. July is Mozzie month, this was my only issue, but they have to live like all of us, I just wish they hadn't decided to live off me for the two weeks, last year we came in May/June and we never got bitten at all. If this is your first time to this hotel you will love it, our friend was over the moon and is so thankful that she came with us on such a fantastic holiday. I would still return to this hotel but as I have now done it twice I think a new location is needed. Our friend would return tomorrow if she could.

The hotel staff were all very friendly, the rooms and grounds were very clean, and the food was great. The buffet food was the best (especially the pizza) but we also enjoyed eating at the Japanese and Mexican restaurant. There was something for everyone. We had our wedding on July 13th and everything was very well organized and the wedding coordinators did a great job (thanks, Edith, Cynthia, & Rebecca) and helped to make it a personal, special event for us and our friends and family. We did experience the mosquitos so do take bug spray, but if you forget the local stores and the store at the resort sell it. It's also a good idea to take a floatie with you if you want one because they are expensive there. And bring an insulated drink mug to keep your drinks cold. We went for walks up and down the beach at other resorts and the beach at the Yucatan was one of the best compared to the others. Most beaches north of the Yucatan resort (except for RIU Palace next door) had huge sand bags still on the beach and in the water (you would have to walk over them to get to the water). The Yucatan beach was a bit crowded sometimes because it was the better of the RIU beahes but if you are willing to move the lounge chairs around to find a spot or go down early then there is no problem getting a spot at the beach. One of our friends had his birthday when we are there and when were having dinner one night we told our waiter. They all came over and sang happy birthday, made a great hat for him and brought a whole cake with candles (see photos). We had 19 people stay with us at the Yucatan and most people had no or few problems with their room. When we arrived they upgraded us to a suite for our 2 week wedding/honeymoon stay, it was very nice. My parents unfortunately had a problem with their airconditioning not working properly. They requested 3 times for someone to come to fix it and each time a different person came to look at it but never really fixed it. So my parents after 4 days requested to be moved, which they willing accomidated.

I've read a lot of reviews about the hotel and was a litlle worried that I made the wrong choice. But I'm glad I made this choice because the hotel is really good. Let me list you the pro's and contra's of the hotel. Pro's: * Hotel cleanness (even though this is not easy in a tropical area) * Staff was very friendly and helpful * Food was really good and with variety * Rooms are spacious and clean (just a pitty that there's no bathtub) * nice beach (even though it's true, the beach has become smaller than a couple of years ago) * nice pool area * very good service * nice sport facilities (tennis courts, ping pong,...) Contra's: * a lot of mosquito's (and sandbugs) * no airconditioned relaxing space (except for the rooms) * the pool is too hot, it feels like you're swimming in a warm jacuzzi. The pool doesn't give you the refreshness you're looking for in a hot country like Mexico. * You have to get up very early to have a nice seat at the pool or beach. All good seats are reserved when you arrive after 8 a.m. * A lot of young Americans who come for a weekend of 4-day trip and seem to enjoy more the evening (late night) activities than the day. They really make a lot of noise at night and when you have the bad luck to have them stay in the room next to yours... * people from the other Riu hotels (who aren't located at the beach) can also come to the Riu Yucatan and stay there for the day. This means even less seats at the pool or beach... Overall, I would say this is a great hotel especially for families but it's not a super hotel. If you're looking for the hidden gem or a romantical stay, look further. If you're looking for a quit and relaxing stay, look further. If you look for a good vacation with a lot of fun (at night), free drinks and good weather and good service, than this is the place to be. Personally, the next time I would choose the Riu Palace Riviera Maya hotel (just a few hotels further). This is an even better hotel with higher standards on service, profile of people staying there, and the romance and relaxing environment you're looking for even if it means I'll have to pay more for this hotel.", "Date": "July 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lampeter", "Title": "\u201cWhere has the Caribbean Beach Gone?\u201d", "Author": "Gut", "ReviewID": "UR8191611", "Content": "This is our second visit to Riu Yucatan flying out from of Cardiff Wales Air Port some 10 minutes away on the 20th June 07 to 4th July 07 with Thomson. Last year we enjoyed our selves and this year likewise. The main positives are the clean well kept grounds and how friendly the staff are. Bartenders will make you any and as many drinks as you want, you name it and they will present you with the cocktail of your choice. If you drink Gordons then you must ask for it by name otherwise you get there equivalent which was not to my taste. All other staff members are all ready to greet you with a friendly 'hola'. This was apparent at check in, as when we arrived a welcome cocktail was offered and our room keys, safe key and beach towel cards were given and bags delivered to our room. The restaurants were excellent. The Hacienda buffet had plenty to choose from. The a la carte restaurants were all very good. The steak house was very nice, as long as you only expect an average steak. The Asian was also very good. We didn't try the Mexican al a carte. The grounds were well kept very clean, as were toilet areas which were constantly being cleaned. Our only disappointment was to find the beach had disappeared by over 50% in width due to the previous storms. This has left the beach across many of the adjacent hotels scared with sand bags shoring up palm trees, buildings and acting as a defence against further erosion. Larger sand bags holding 80 to 100 tons of sand lies in place like beached up whales protecting property. This has had a knock on effect through out the Pool area and beach below of the Yucatan as other Hotels like the Riu Tequila who shares our beach together with the Riu Palace next door all compete for sun beds. One has to get up at 6 am to get a sunbed and shade. One would see guests of other Hotels arriving at this time and reserving 8 -10 beds with fliflops, bath towels, magazines etc and go away for a few hours no point of complaining as the pool attendant would put out towels out for a German couple every day of our stay. Other German couple would reserve 3 sunbeds and only use 2 this was to give them some more space as both pool and beach beds were laid out side by side like a tin of sardines because of the reduced beach area. No way was this a Caribbean beach that I new last year or have visited else where. I attach photos of last years expanse of beach and this years over crowded beach with beach chairs and people crowded like penguins. Trips to Chichen Itza were worth a visit we did not use our Thomson Rep. but went with Apple vacation at a far reduced cost and of equal standards. Cozumel is worth trip locally on the ferry on a dull day nothing much over there except shops namely jewllers (don't accept their asking price - haggle) and trippers coming off cruise ships. A trip on the local bus to Cancun is worth a visit, they run frequently and are air conditioned and comfortable. The mosquitoes were horrendous and in abundance this year as were bites off ants bring plenty of repellent. Entertainment during the day varied some thing for every one and with a daily midday doze of bingo which lowered the standards of the complex. The evening entertainment was of average standards and nothing to write home about, more professional shows could have been put on.", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "staffs", "Title": "\u201cHoliday in paradise\u201d", "Author": "jan_dStaffs", "ReviewID": "UR8131798", "Content": "After reading the comments made by others I was really apprehensive, mainly about the beach as we are beach lovers.

However it is easier and chepaer to book the excursions yourselves. For Xcaret, we brought our ticket from Thomsons tour operator, but we booked our own taxi which was $12USD each way. Tulum, we just got the bus from Playa Del Carmen Bus Station... There are loads of buses and are very frequent & cheep and so you can spend as long as you want there.

When we arrived the very first minute at a lobby showed us- that gonna be very different. We came by a taxi a little worried if Yucatan is informed about us retreating from Riu Lupita. And they were indeed. After a second we felt like the whole Yucatan was waiting just for us. Managers, staff, everyone were coming towards us with their welcome. We were given a magnificent room with beautiful view. And all our anger for Riu Lupita stay was gone. Rooms at Yucatan are very nice, service close to perfection, beach is probably best in show in that area. Food- a little sluggish, but still not bad at all. We haven't had any problems with sunbeds(maybe just a little bit). We have got all possible help from Sunquest representatives both in Lupita and Yucatan, so we will never hesitate to deal with that company again. Yucatan has a beautiful well maintained gardens, nice people work there. Service never lacked anything. Tourists are a good mixture of Europeans and North Americans. Nobody dominates so everyone is happy. Ocean was beautiful, water very warm, weather was not a problem. Grounds are very even- nice to walk around. Beautiful animals are making everyone very excited all the time. They walk around and kids are going simply nuts! The area for improvements- pools.

The staff were amazing (as were the bartenders), The rooms were always immaculate and the beach was excellent! We took advantage of the other RIUs including the ones in Cancun (which is a great option-you can visit Cancun and not have to spend a ton of money) but the beach there was full of seaweed-it was literally impossible to swim without it. At the Yucatan, the beach was very clean, the water perfect, and even the pool was immaculate. A big European destination, its refreshingly more mature than Cancun. If you choose to go to Play Del Carmen, stay here, and here's a few tips for a great vacation: -Go to Xel-Ha, and book the tour online before you go-its cheaper. Do an all inclusive, but not with Tulum, you need a whole day in Xel-Ha and its good to have food and drinks waiting for you. -Rent a car-its expensive at the hotel (60 a day) but worth it. You can go to Tulum in the morning before everyone gets there, swim in the ocean and leave before the tourists. its 4$ to get in. Then you can drive to Coba or Chichen Itza-frankly, Coba has the taller ruin and you can climb it-plus its just as rich in history. Ch. Itz. is alot more walking and you can't climb up it. So you pick. We walked ALOT, and frankly, I couldn't do more than those two. Wear incredibly comfortable shoes-you'll need them. Eat at the restaurant in Coba-Faisano i think it was called-BEST Mayan food, it seems touristy but that's where the locals eat. -Some people complained about the hard beds: all beds in MX are hard. They have to be so they don't suck in moisture and bugs don't infest them. Some complained about a faint mildue smell. The city has done what it can with their water. Its ocean water. Its going to have asmell. There's tons of chlorine in it too. Take that into consideration. Everything along the shore has a certain smell, that's just how it is. The food there wasn't stellar, but it wasn't horrible either. I wasn't there for four seasons dining. The selection was wonderful, the service fantastic. The food was pretty damn good, I think. -DO NOT attempt to walk that walk to downtown playa unless you wish to be covered in sweat. It's a 50 minute walk if you walk briskly. The cab is $5-Playa is 30 blocks of shopping. That's ALOT of walking! The shopping there is wonderful-definitely take advantage of it-eat at Sushi Itto, drink at Starbucks i fyou like, party at Blue Parrot, but be prepared, its a slab of wood on the beach, lots of sand-wear comfy shoes. -Most of all, have fun.

PLEASE NOTE-- although the resort is an all inclusive there is nothing wrong with tipping the great service---My cousin and I( fifty-something latinas who are not rich, believe me!!!) made sure to carry dollar bills to tip the bartenders.

The rooms were ample for our needs and spotlessly clean with no insect problems.We stayed in block 6 near the the theatre facing a neighbouring hotel separated by trees which during the 2nd week of our stay became home to the Howler monkeys.

So, day 1 found us back at reception asking to move rooms, which we were able to do the next day. The food in the main restaurant was excellent, there was a good choice, and the waiters were friendly and helpful. Day 2 we got up at what we thought was early as we were still 6 hours ahead, had breakfast then got to the pool by about 9.30, but although there were maybe a hundred or so deckchairs, literally every one was taken, we managed to find two together on the beach a little way back from the sea, but those weren\u2019t as comfortable as the ones by the pool. For the rest of the holiday we were up at 7.30 every morning to put some towels on the sun beds, but even at that time there were only about half left to choose from. The pools were quite nice, although they weren\u2019t very clean, and one of them was heated, which really wasn\u2019t needed in the heat as it was like swimming in a hot bath. The beach, well there wasn\u2019t really any beach as it had suffered quite badly from erosion, so all the sunbeds were crammed together in long lines. The one time we managed to find two together, in the sun, we had only just sat down when we were surrounded by about 10 people and a member of the \u2018entertainment team\u2019 who were about to play horseshoes within yards of were we were sitting, so we moved\u2026 again. The mornings by the pool were fairly quiet and relaxing, up until about 10am when it started getting very noisy and busy, (about the same time as the pool bars open) It then got noisier and noisier until about 3pm when the entertainment started, blaring out noise and shouting into the microphone, at that point we normally decided it was time for a Siesta and went back to the room for some peace and quiet. The rooms were nice, the minibar was good, but if you had a drink, you had to be careful about putting it on the bedside table as it had ants swarming over it within the hour. We found the excursions were very good, as it gave us a chance to get out of the hotel, but don\u2019t go to Xcaret, it was like a Theme Park with long queues but no rides. The Yucatan is not a good place for couples, as it was far too noisy and crowded, it might be better for a group of friends who just want to get drunks and party, but if you are looking for a relaxing holiday, this hotel is not for you, try the Riu Palace next door.

Most of the previous reviews were accurate concerning the rooms, food and activities, so I won't go into details. One thing that we did not know, was the Riu Tequila is not on the beach, the people who stay there come to the Yucatan to use the beach. This causes the overcrowding at the pools also. Although this is problem is not the Riu's fault, people should be aware. To be honest, the only real problems we occured during our stay was with some (very) rude guests and the MOSQUITOS. For some reason, the hotels lobby is a haven for the pesky critters. If you stand-or sit still- for seconds, you will get bit numerous times. This happened to us the second day we were there and we learned our lesson. The rowdy guests were the major distraction. We have stayed in the Riviera Maya three (3) times now and it is getting worst. For some reason, some Americans and Europeans alike think they have the license to act like FOOLS when they go to these resorts. How management puts up with these idiots is beyond me. I don't know if it is the time of year we go or what, but we can't seem to get away from these \"animals\".

We asked for a soda restock in our mini-bar twice and someone was there with it immediately. Also, we asked for a taxi to be called on a number of occasions and the longest we ever had to wait was 2 minutes for it to arrive. Unlike, the Riu Palace's beach, the Riu Yucatan has not been as affected by errosion. The beach is mostly intact, with only a slight drop off between the sitting chair area and the water. In contrast, the Riu palace has a 5-7 foot drop between the chair area and the water. The food at the Riu Yucatan was relatively good, although some things are better than others. The specialty restaurants typically have better food, but the buffet is pretty good too. However, if you are staying at the hotel for many days you may want to include a few trips to restaurants on fifth avenue in your budget, because sometimes you may want something other than the same resort food. The bars are very good in both the Riu Yucatan and Riu Tequila Resorts. You can get just about anything whenever you want and the bar tenders are really nice and generally speak english. The pool bars are especially fun! The one area the Riu Yucatan is lacking in is nightly entertainment. However, this is not a problem, because the Riu Tequila has great nightly entertainment and a discotec. Guests at Riu Yucatan have exchange privileges with Riu Tequila, so you can go there in the evening and still have all-inclusive drinks at the bar. While in Mexico, take advantage of excursions as well. These can usually be set up right at the hotel. We went horseback riding on the beach and it was awesome! Go Horseback Riding if you can!!! We also went to Tulum (Mayan Ruins), which was also great! There is even a beach at Tulum, so bring your bathing suit if you have time to swim. Overall, my husband and I loved the Riu Yucatan.

We have visited Mexico many times and stayed at the Iberostar hotels which are around the same price or a few dollars more but have higher standards and more class and worth the extra money.

If you are debating between an Iberostar vs a Riu, go with the Iberostar you won't regret it.

I don't understand how people can be so upset by it nor how people can be so amazed by it either. I booked directly through the riu website. This included the transfers from the airport to the hotel. (As a side note, we did not encounter a single solictation for time shares at the renovated airport). We were driven by Jesus in an airconditioned van and we were the only stop. If you've never been to Mexico before, I believe that it is illegal for vans to have any sort of suspension in them. And Mexico loves speed bumps! Anyways, I digress. The check-in was easy. There's always somebody at the counter. They greet you with a drink. G-d knows what it was. I am not much of a drinker, and I feel that takes away from the enjoyment that others seem to enjoy about the Yucatan (more on this later). We were shown to our room by the bellhop. It is a brightly colored room. It gives it a bit of a tacky, yet festive feel. As stated by many others, the bed was hard, but it didn't bother me too much. You get used to it. I didn't detect any musty smell, except for on the towels. The room safe is unique. They give you a barrel lock to put in the safe. It's kind of funny, but effective for what it does. I wish they had room cards instead of keys. They're more convenient for carrying around and getting wet. Not a big deal, I guess. The bathroom shower stall is very small and dimly lit. I don't think there was any light in the stall itself. I found that there was a distinct lack of hot water when showering before 9am. It was fine at all other times. The sik in the bathroom had a gigantic crack in it. It didn't affect its usage, but that alone would show you that it's no 5-star hotel. The beach: The beach was highly crowded. You can find chairs if you're just looking for two. I can see how you'd need to get up early to find a large group together. The water had that postcard quality azure to it. Surprisingly, there were plenty of random chunks of concrete in the water. How the heck did they get there? I doubt it was from any of the past hurricanes. There is a drop off/cliff between where the chairs are and the water. I guess this was a result of the past hurricanes. I'm not fussy, but it wasn't the best beach I've ever seen. The Entertainment: Unfortunately, I didn't watch any of the nightly shows. It was always crowded and the people seemed to enjoy watching them. The animacion team was nice. They recruited me for games of water polo and volleyball. I love beach volleyball. The games are friendly (not competitive) and fun. It's funny how the coconut branches hang over the volleyball court and provides for some interesting ricochets. It was a blast! I did utilize the beachside service to go parasailing. It was only $35. I was expecting it to be double. That was a pleasant surprise. The Food: Obviously, everyone's opinion of the food varies. There is the main buffet place, a poolside snack place and three alacarte restaurants (for dinner). I don't know if they were having an off-week, but there was little variety for the buffet for the six days we were there. I think they had the same food for 5 of the six days were there. The food was fair. Some food was better than others. We ate at the steakhouse and the Mexican alacarte places. The steakhouse had okay steak. It certainly wasn't Morton's, but they did have an interesting show with the flaming baked Alaskan. The Mexican place was better than the steakhouse. It was fun and gave a faux Mexican theme that you would expect in the states. So the food overall was decent, but don't come here if you're a food connosieur. You will be thoroughly disappointed. I would definitely recommend wandering out of the hotel and visiting 5th avenue for some local food. Overall, this is a decent place. It is not some five-star hotel, but a good intermediate hotel. There were all sorts of people staying there. Young, old, teens, people Canadians, Texans, European men in thongs and topless European women. The main positives are the clean grounds and the friendly staff. I cannot emphasize enough how friendly they are. Bartenders will make you as many drinks as you want and other staff members are all ready to greet you with a friendly 'hola'. Everything they did was done with a smile. Obviously, it lacked a bit in the quality of the room and food, but that's exactly what I budgeted for. If I wanted the best, then I would have paid more. The Riu Yucatan is what it is. A typical average hotel. I have previously stayed at the Barcelo Riviera Maya and can say without a doubt that it was better than the Riu Yucatan in every aspect. The only thing the Yucatan seemed to be competitive in was the amount of free alcohol at the bars and in your room.", "Date": "June 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGreat time at the Yucatan!\u201d", "Author": "agray3", "ReviewID": "UR7868281", "Content": "We stayed 9 nights at the Riu Yucatan in June and it was wonderful. It was our first trip to this property, thought we have stayed previously at a Riu in Cancun. The grounds are beautiful with animals of different kinds running about. We arrived early and were immediately checked in and greeted with a delicious drink. Our room was on the ground floor in building 6 which was a good location for us--I think it depends what you prefer to be closer to. I hesitate to sound too negative because we LOVED the hotel, but our room was quite loud at night. The marble hallways just resonated all sounds. I'm not a light sleeper but I found this to be a problem. If you're a light sleeper at all I'd take ear plugs. If we retrurn, which I hope we do, I might request a room on the second floor to see if it's quieter. BEACH-The beach was down to about 5 chairs. I could definitely see where people who visited this property with the \"old\" beach would be surprised, but we didn't have problems. The water was BEAUTIFUL. The beaches at the hotels south of the Yucatan (a couple of Iberostars and not sure what else) had much wider beaches but didn't have as many palm trees. We loved the palm trees at the Yucatan beach. RIU TEQUILA-We spent some time at the Tequila which had a great pool, sports bar and lobby. I think though, I'm glad we spent a little extra to stay at the Yucatan, only because it's much easier to run back to the room from the beach. The walk to/from the Tequila wasn't bad. We didn't use the shuttle. GENERAL-The towels did have a musty smell but it was livable. The food was very good and varied. If people can't find enough to eat with what is offered they're insatiable in my opinion. The Mexican specialty dinner was very good--we didn't do the other two. The cleaning staff was wonderful. The bartenders and drinks were very good. The entertainment crew was very friendly and the shows were good. There was a great vibe by the pool/bar area in the evenings. You could either sit at the bar, sit in the show, or kind of sit in between. There was often music (sometimes live which was great). It was just a very nice, jovial place in the evenings.

A big thank you to Dave & Collette who made everything run so well. the only real down side, im afriad, was the behaviour of certain americans at the swim up bar, most of whom seemed there for a wedding. throwing drinks in the pool; shout swearing and being very obnoxious is not good behaviour by anyone's standards. they seemed totally oblivious to everyone else there and were getting on peoples nerves. you could sense the relief when they left on the weekend of the 10th June. I even witnessed the very sad site of a Paris Hilton wannabe in the cantina bar who was teasing a barman with tips before she left, waving notes at him then pulling them away as he went to take them & alughing at him. her friends found it hilarious; we were embarrassed.

That was soonly deflated by the fact that our beds were infested with ants from the rotten candy they had left as a nice gesture on our bed. Thank god I didn't have my children with me or they would have gone right for the candy and had it in their mouth before I could even blink an eye. So, the maids came and sprayed our beds down with Raid and changed the sheets. They were going to just spray the bed down and leave the sheets and comforters until we instructed them that was not going to happen. Our wonderful room also had that smell that most rooms do in Mexico, however, ours had an underlying urine smell that you would catch every so often. Especially in the closet where our clothes were hanging. When we did finally crawl in to bed at night, that was quite the unpleasant surprise. The beds were hard as rocks. I kept saying I felt like I was sleeping on box springs. I slept horrible the whole time I was there and it didn't matter how many drinks I had in me. Next was the food, it was okay and typical of what you would get from the caliber of a Jack Tar Village. If I were a college student that might fly but open air eating in every restaurant is NOT my ideal situation. The last few places I have stayed have enclosed restaurants (still buffet style) but they have wait staff filling your water and constantly helping you. My biggest complaint was the fact that when you were poolside or beachside you did not have wait staff getting you drinks. This may sound lazy but you had to get up and go to the bar, of the sometimes less than friendly bartenders, to get drinks. One time we ordered Mojito's and the bartender said they didn't have them, after the person in front of us just ordered one. We questioned him on it and he finally admitted he didn't want to make Mojito's because crushing the lime and mint made his arm hurt???? Of course we ordered Mojito's for the rest of the day.

Had a great time but things have changed since last year. Last year we stayed exactly the same 2 weeks but in the Riu Tequila. If you are looking to go out then I would really recomend it, great place for families but a couple of things to be aware of... the first being the beach, last year was plenty of white sand running gently into the sea, this year there was about 12 feet of beach from the steps of the Yucatan then a 4ft drop down to the sea, sometimes the sand was washed away leaving very sharp sandstone. They are really struggling to keep the beach all along the stretch, every couple of days they were digging up palm trees which were in danger of crashing down and replanting them nearer to the hotel, some hotels are placing sandbags to stop the sea from taking the beach, they are working on it but at the moment are not winning the battle. So if you are looking for lots of white sand look elsewhere. The other problem we had, which was not for all of the holiday but maybe for 3-4 nights on seperate occasions was youngsters (and not just Brits this time but some Americans) who get a little drunk and are very noisy in the early hours, banging on doors trying to find their rooms, which we did not encounter last year so maybe we just had bad luck on this.

As said this was our second time and will consider going next year if Thomson get themselves sorted out. Great holiday and if you are thinking of a Mexican experience you wont go far wrong with this hotel, if their management do read this they just need to sort the beach (which maybe a difficult one) and they young drinkers which I am sure they could sort out. otherwise go for it.......", "Date": "June 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation\u201d", "Author": "SLGL", "ReviewID": "UR7833675", "Content": "As I began my search for my husband and I's first trip to Mexico, I reviewed this website over and over again and was a little nervous.

Beware, there are topless, in case you bring your kiddos, and it isn't a big deal! The food was okay, we ate at the steak restaurant one night, and it was okay too. Not being use to other nationalilty food was a little different, but believe me we didn't starve. There are tons of variety too choose from, the breakfast is the best! We went to Xel-ha on our stay and I recommend it to anyone. Absolutely beautiful and you can't do everything in one day.

I researched this resort inside and out before and now I want to give you my view of the resort. Check In: Check in was fast and the staff was helpful, we were greeted by a tour guide where we booked three excursions all together costing 250. I would reccomend two, Tulum Extreme, and Party Hopper Cancun. These two tours are great but if you are not a night life person don't do the party hopper. NightLife in General: Like I said we did the Party Hopper and weather or not you are a nightlife person you have to go to COCO BONGO. If you don't know what it is its easly described as a show and a club in one. The party hopper is nice because all drinks are included and you have someone that herds you to club to club safely. On the resort: La Pinata nightclub is like awesome. They play a great mix of music mostly techno and 80's and of course the drinks are free. There are not alot of singles but there are enough there to make it enjoyable. (if you are single) The Rooms: The room is a hotel room, the beds are very unconforable, but you get used to them. There is a musty smell but the resort is extremely tropical and the moisture does that. It's nothing unbearable or even noticable after a few minutes. The rooms are cleaned every day and your mini bar restocked whenever you ask. The Food: The food in my opinion was great for everything being included. It was not a five star restraunt but it was good. We tried all three restaunts and I wasnt impressed with the asian or steak house but the Mexican was very good. The Bars and alchohol: The bartenders are your friends they intreact and make you right at home. They never hesitate to help you and are always up for a shot. The drinks are great and they may not be that strong but if you want it strong just ask for it. They really are great about serving everyone and not leaving anyone out. The bars recieve a 5 out of 5. The Staff: The staff is excellent because everyone is always smiling and wanting to help you out. The workers are always keeping the grounds up and always at your beck and call. The Beach: The beach is very crouded but they do try their best to keep it clean and if there isnt room at the beach there is the pool that always have room. The weather: The Weather Channel said that we had 60 % chance of rain the entire week we were at the Yucatan and we got NO rain. Way to go Weather Channel. Overall the Yucatan was amazing there was no problems and you feel at home after five minutes of being there. I will be returning and the 11 people I traveled with will be doing the same. For the money it's worth it, trust me unless your hard to please like some of these people on this review seem to be, you will have the best week of your life. Just pack enough sun sceen and an extra stomach. oh and GO TO COCO BONGO in Cancun it will be an amazing night.

They worked so hard and the shows were as good as some we have seen in the West End. The hotel room was very well equiped and we didn't find the beds hard at all. Food wise there was so much choice and everything was freshly prepared and cooked. The restaurants are all light and airy and the staff very attentive. We will certainly be going back to this hotel in the near future. Look out for the Howler Monkeys and shirakees that live in the trees and gardens they are very entertaining.

Riu Yucatan was perfect. The staff was very fun and helpful. The landscaping of the grouds was very nice. We liked that the rooms were in smaller units, (like condo buildings...)vs one really large hotel. We stayed in building 6, which was awesome because it was so close to the beach, but maybe too close to the nighttime bar activities. The buffet food was good. A huge selection and I loved the latte machine! We tried all three of the specialty restaurants. (Take note-you have to make reservations for this.) The advantage is that you are waited on vs the buffet in the main building. My favorite was probably the Steak house. The beach was beautiful. We spoke with some people that had been there before, and apparantly the beach is much smaller than it used to be because of Katrina hurricane. Some resorts has NO beach left--not good. But Riu Yucatans was really nice and the water was warm. I would reccomend taking a taxi downtown to 5th Ave. It is a huge strip that is closed to cars and it is just shop after shop and restaurants. We kinda stumbled on it, so I wanted to be sure to remark that it is worth the trip. There are a bunch of Riu's there, and I guess they are all reciprocal with each other. We checked out the Palace next door, and we thought that our Riu was much more social. We all really liked the fact that it was all inclusive.

Sorry it's so long. We were four adults (moms & one aunt) and three 18-year old girls for a 5-night trip. Had a phenomenal time and thought the hotel was great. Nice laid-back, open air feeling, every single staff person was extremely friendly and helpful, the food was great and we thought the buffet was fine - made one reservation one night for the Mexican and it was ok, but we really didn't want to bother with seating times so ended up at the buffet other nights. Breakfast: Fresh fruit, yogurt, great breads and rolls, Nutella, marmalade, plus all the usual breakfast items, omelettes made to order etc., sit on the patio - watch out for the birds! - lovely in the morning, they bring you a pot of coffee - can buy the Times in the gift shop. Wonderful fresh juices every morning. Lucnh seems to go on all day down at the beach/pool area, we were usually so full from breakfast that we just loaded up on fruit, chips, tostadas, etc. - huge bowls of delicious guacamole available all the time - the girls ate every day at the poolside hamburger grill and said it was great but the moms weren't that hungry. Dinner - huge variety every night, even the sushi was OK one night (yes, not what you'd get in a real sushi place, but fun and close enough for the situation). Lots of veggies - artichokes, salads, tomatoes piled with ceviche, great soups, pasta bar out on the patio - we feel that we basically ate all week. Room was a bit musty when we checked in (all three rooms) but disappeared by that night after air was on consistently. The bottles of water they stock in the fridge are huge and really useful for bringing to the beach, etc. Shower was great, towels were fine, the beds were hard but somehow really comfortable and we slept great. (Here's a tip for those traveling with teens: we made each girl stay with her parent, not share a room, and it was great at around 2:30am to know each one was back in the room with mom.) We were in Block 1 and the first night I could hear the show from the hotel next door, and thought, uh oh, but it was fine, really very soundproof and didn't bother me at all. None of the rooms are on the ocean and unless you're in one of the blocks that sits way back behind the lobby, you're fine. I tipped every day and always had lots of towels, fridge full, etc. Towel animals all the time, kind of goofy but cute. My daughter kept telling me to turn the AC down, it really worked well, in fact we had extra blankets brought to the room. A couple things broke while we were there: TV, phone, fridge - but fixed INSTANTLY so not even an issue at all. Amazing swift service. And Carlos at the front desk is a hoot - called to ask the time (as I never managed to set my clock right) and his response: \"Why do you want to know?\" Then of course the answer, but always a little joke first. Pools were great, swim-up bars lots of fun. I personally didn't see any of the underage drinking people talk about but there weren't really that many teens - although our girls sure found a lot of boys to talk to (college-age), dance with and hang out with. They had fun at the Tequila disco, although at first they said it was a bit lame, I think later on - after midnight - is when it got more lively. All I know is we were usually dragging them in around 2:30am! It was a big treat for them to get to order drinks, etc., be treated as adults. The drinks are really weak, so although they definitely could feel the effects, they could have a couple and not be falling down. I, on the other hand, liked to order an extra shot of rum in the pina colada because otherwise it didn't taste like much. The alcohol overall was just ok - since I drink mostly wine and it was pretty bad, I feel as though I actually didn't have that much to drink but what I had was fun and not usually the stuff you make at home, i.e. pina coladas, daiquiris, etc. Tequila slammers taste like cough mediciine according to my friend (I didn't try one) but the girls and everyone else seemed to like them...or maybe just the fun of the \"slam\" part. The saving a chair with a towel thing is a bit ridiculous but we never really had a problem finding enough loungers together at the pool or the beach. Dappled shade at the beach from the palm trees was fine and we would usually find a couple loungers at the pool under palapas and in the sun and would just trade back and forth. One day I was at the pool first and found two chairs, then the German couple next to me left, taking everything but their towel. My friends arrived, one took the other chair that I had saved, and then finally one neatly folded the German's towel and set it aside, put hers down and stayed. Five hours they were gone - then they came back (and we were almost ready to leave anyway) and were upset that she had moved their towel! Very silly - of course my friend just graciously got up, pointed to their neatly folded and unscathed towel and moved but they acted as if they had bought the chair! The crazy thing was, at this point it was late in the afternoon and there were tons of empty chairs around, both in shade and sun, take your pick. But that was our only towel-related incident. Beach was fine the first two days and then a \"cliff\" developed and the shale was exposed as you walked in. But the water was still warm and turquoise, and once you got past the rocky part (be careful, I fell and scraped my knee quite badly) it's fine. Here's a disclaimer: we live very near an amazing beach in Florida, so for us the lack of the wide, deep beach is not a big deal - we can see that at home. However, we spoke to some folks from Cincinnati who were disappointed at the beach. I thought it was lovely - the water is a whole different shade there and had no issues with it. Topless all over by the way, at the pool and the beach, not a big deal unless you make it so. Saw nothing gross or indecent, mostly just \"mom\" bodies and some grandmas, a few younger women. Just depends on where you're from - no one seemed at all self-conscious...or show-offy. If you want to take a walk, just head south past the next two resorts and the beach becomes wider and voila, deserted. Keep walking and you come to some rocks and tidepools, really lovely vistas. Immediately north of the resort, no beach, forget walking that direction. SPECIAL HATS-OFF TO EDVENTURE!! An amazing day and so laid-back and easy. He lined up a fantastic driver for us, please request Carlos, you won't be disappointed, who showed up with a roomy van and endless patience as he herded 7 women throughout the day. Told lots of stories, stopped at local stores to pick up honey and vanilla (and cervesa). Eddie met us at each location - what a job - took us snorkeling in the cenote (cold - wear the half wet suit but SO refreshing on a hot day), snorkeling at Akumal (we saw at least 10 big sea turtles close enough to stroke their backs), snorkeling at Yal-kul (like being in an aquarium and beautiful sculpture garden, could spend all day there easily). Started with ruins at Tulum in the morning - hot - and broken up mid-day with lunch at La Buena Vida, nice swing bar and decent food, it's the setting that stands out, right on the bay and in the sand. Lovely lovely day - Carlos met us at 7:30am and I don't think we got back until around 6:30 or so. Bring your underwater camera, we wished we had. All for about $75 a person - incredible deal when you consider what one of those impersonal bus tours would cost. Spent one night out in Playa del Carmen - what a great town! Wished we had gone in sooner, shops stayed open until around 10-11 (it was a Saturday night), had a good dinner (at \"Ajul\"?) then the girls went to Club Bali and had a blast. The old moms went in too for a while and watched, then left and waited outside for the girls - I wouldn't be comfortable with leaving young girls in Playa at night late to get a cab - big street scene, although I felt 100% safe, lots of cabbies, police, people - sort of like Soho etc. on any given night - more worried about cute girls in a foreign country, possible poor judgment and strange men. Plus our cell phones never worked there at all. Anyway, a special nod to Bali as the security was wonderful there, the club was packed (after 1am - that's when people started to pour in) and they really treated the girls well - I felt like the guys who worked there were all friendly, the manager even helped me \"extract\" them at the end of the night - in a nice way, went down on the floor where they were dancing and pointed me out. Smoke, strobe ights, belly dancers on the bar, confetti shooting in the air, great DJ (according to the girls) - they had a blast and were NOT ready to leave at 3:30am. I walked through Blue Parrot on my own (just to check it out - the doorman let me right in, no cost when I told him I was just looking it over for \"mi hija\") and it looks like a great scene too but really checking ID's and our girls didn't have theirs - didn't want to risk bringing passports out at night, not worth the potential loss. (PS I noticed that Bali was checking ID's too, but I guess since we entered with the girls before it got crazy - around 12:30 - and vouched for them, it was OK). Anyway, bottom line on at least the busy parts of Playa we saw - very secure feeling and great street scene, tons of open-air bars, restaurants and lots of great shops interspersed with the usual tourist dreck. We would go back in a second - the girls did not want to leave at all and kept trying to figure out a way to stay longer. Weather was beautiful, rained twice, not for long. But it's the Yucatan, what do you expect? The rainy season is starting, it will be rainy. So balmy at night, perfect tropical weather, not too hot or chilly. No sweaters required. Overall we felt it was an amazing value for what we paid - used Spirit Air and Spirit Vacations (which in turn books through Mark Travel) and all was fine. Cancun airport very nice and although forewarned, no real hassle from any timeshare people. Lomas Travel was there looking for us and then direct to the hotel.", "Date": "June 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lubbock, Texas", "Title": "\u201cRiu Yucatan is awesome!!!

The Riu Palace which was next to us had about an 8 to 10 foot drop off. From our hotel south, the beach was awesome. The other direction - there basically is no beach left. They removed a tree on the beach at the Riu Palace while we were there. The pools were nice however, we did not use them. The buffet was good. The breakfast had at least 7 fresh squeezed juices each morning. There was plenty of chicken, fish, fresh fruit, salad, hamburgers, pizza, a huge variety of foods. We thought that the food was very good. We made reservations and ate at the Mexican restaurant one night. We really enjoyed it. The appetizers were a buffet. We had the grilled shrimp and burritos. We also ate at the Steak restaurant one night. It was very good but not as good as the Mexican in our opinion. We did not try the Asian restaurant. I would recommend taking bug spray - there were quite a few mosquitoes. We went to Xel-ha one day. We had been in 2001 and were a little disappointed this time.

I am hard pressed to come up with anything to complain about. I started by booking through Travelocity, which went really smooth. Got some great flights(1-stop less than an hour each), which put us there early on our arrival and late on our departure. The weather situation was pretty scary. The Weather Channel was showing rain/thunder storms for the entire trip. When we got into the shuttle, the driver said the rainy season had started early. As we bagan the trip to the hotel(Olypus Tours-bought through Travelocity), it began raining. It was coming down pretty good. As soon as we pulled up to our hotel(Riu Yucatan-Playa del Carmen)and stepped out of the van, the rain stopped. It was warm and sunny the rest of the way. We got to the hotel at noon(check-in was 3:00PM), we were immediately greated, offered a drink and given our wristbands. We were also given a room right away. The view wasn't really what I expected, however we were close to the pool. There was a problem with our electric, but it was corrected very quickly. The room was nice. There was a faint musty smell, but after the A/C ran for a while, it was gone. The grounds were amazing! My fiance was extremely pleased, because she likes animals and there were plenty of those roaming around. The pool area was nice. There were 2 large pools(both with swim-up bars). One was crowded and very busy(water activities). The other was more relaxed for just lounging. The beach was beautiful! Top Notch compared to the other beaches in the area. Here's a tip, if you are taking children, there isn't a specific area for topless sun bathing. There were boobs all around the pool/beach area. Food was ok, but definately make reservations for the Steak house. Entertainment(other than hanging by the bar and drinking) was at a minimum. The are other hotels with clubs in the area. The Yucatan is definately a party place though. Everytime we returned to the hotel(no mater what time) there was always people up having a good time. As far as off site entertainment goes, downtown Playa del Carmen was great. Senor Frogs/Carlos n Charlie's(on 5th) and on 12th there are several places. Our favorite was the Blue Parrot. It was right on the beach and they did an amazing fire show. It was incredible. Tours? We went a different route for that. My fiance's friend(who met us down there)found a private tour place through a review he had read. For $75.00 ea, we were provided transportation and gear for several things. We did a 600 ft zip-line through a forest, snorkled through some underground rivers, played with some really fun spider monkeys, snorkled with sea turtles and other fish, stopped for lunch at an amazing restuarant {Buena Vida-not included)on the beach and finished up at another snorkling site with some awesome fish. We were going to do some cliff diving, but got there to late. It was an all day affair 8:30 to about 5:00, but it lasts as long as you want. There was never a rush. A young man named Hector was our guide and he was great!! I haven't fully unpacked yet, so I don't have the info. If you are interested, give me an e-mail and I'll get it for you.(jeffreyallard@sbcglobal.net) We also spent a day in Cozumel. It's $20.00 ea(round-trip) on the ferry. Lots of shopping. There are a few places on the island that rent scooters for $15.00(all day), that would be worth it. To sum it up, it was an amazing trip. The Riu chain is amazing(Yucatan was well worth the money).

Here is an honest opinion. My husband and I and brother and sister-in-law were at this resort May 14-19th. I have to tell you I have never seen a more beautiful beach in all my life. The beach was clean with nice sand and the ocean was nothing but sand going into it. There were no rocks or pebbles or anything sharp. You could see your feet and there were fish swimming around you. The resort was extremely clean and well maintained with lush tropical landscaping. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only downfall was the food. I am not a picky eater in the least. The food at the buffet was not very good and always had the same boring food every day. The specialty restaurants were nothing to right home about either. The entertainment was mediocre.

The pool and the grounds are nice and most of the employees are super nice, but the front desk is worthless and all the ice they use in the mixed drinks make you sick because the water is so bad there. We figured this out two days two late. There is no other beer besides corona on draft and the mixed drinks are so fake and gross and make your stomach hurt. The beach was the most beautiful I'd ever seen though. I was surprised how many europeans there were there. No one spoke english hardly and all the women wanted to sunbathe topless. I think that is low class and gross. The pool was nice though I don't think it is that great of a place for kids since there isn't that much to do for the younger ones. We were told we would receive a honeymoon package when we got there and it wasn't in our room and we asked for it three times and got nothing.

When we first arrived we were told that we may or may not get a suite, which we weren't high maintenance so we didn't really mind. Our suite was so spectacular, if you have the option to get a suite, do it! The whole week was wonderful with a staff that accomodated all 29 of our friends and family. There was something for everyone to do, and plenty of places to explore and travel to. Our wedding was very laid back, only spent 15 minutes with our coordinator a few days before hand and everything was taken care of.

My husband and I returned just last night from our week long stay at the Riu Yucatan - May 6 - May 13. This was our third stay at this resort but the first time ever in Mexico for the couple that travelled with us. I was pretty apprehensive about our trip this time after reading some of the reviews here about erroded beaches, rude staff and otherwise lousy conditions. It was obvious to me immediately on our arrival that the people who submitted those reviews wouldn't be happy even if the trip was free for them. Our whole experience was tremendous. The transfer from the airport was fine - even though it was a little long with all the drop offs at the other resorts - it's not a big deal - you get to see some of the other resorts for comparison. The staff at the Yucatan is fantastic from the wait staff to the bartenders to housekeeping to grounds/maintenance. Everyone is happy to welcome you to their country. The grounds, pool area and common spaces are always immaculate. Anything we needed was given immediately, with a smile. The mini bar and refrigerator were always full. And we really appreciated those extra little touches from the wonderful housekeeping staff like flowers and the special folded towel critters. The food was great - at the buffet and the specialty restaurants. The guys went on a deep sea fishing trip, caught a wahoo and a dorado, and the hotel chef cooked it all perfectly for us. Yes, the beach is erroded in places from the hurricane. But it's a small portion of the beach and the water is within a short, easy walk. We had rain one evening, actually our last evening, and that did bring out the mosquitoes but that was the only time we ever saw flying insects the entire trip. I could go on an on.

Very safe property. Close to downtown Playa. Nice health club and several shops on property. The Riu Palace is nicer if you are traveling with adults, but for kids I would go with the Yucatan. Lots of organized stuff (dart competitons, spanish lessons, dance lessons) to keep them busy. Would definately return.

It has all the amenities, but is very casual and fun. The food, while not gourmet, is very good. The buffet, as everyone says, does get old after a week. We did try the steak house, which we liked. However, a couple members of our party didn't feel well after the night we dined there, but that could be coincidence. At any rate, whatever that was did pass quickly. We never tried the Mexican or the Asian. We did get a chance to walk over to the Tequila. I thought we'd get over there more often - but it was really hard to break ourselves away from the Yucatan. The Tequila looked like a very nice place too - and I think they're bartenders might be more friendly and fun. Although we had a girl bartender at the Yucatan - Kristle, who was very friendly and nice. The shows started very late and we only saw three. The Michael Jackson show was the best. The comedy show was kind of lame, but the dancing in between the comedy sets was good. We were always very tired by the time the shows came around. We were going to party until we dropped - not having the kids with us this time. Unfortunately, we usually ended up dropping very early after a day of too many cocktails, too much food, and too much sun! But thats what vacation is for! The rooms were good, I thought. Everything worked in ours, air, TV, toilet, fridge, etc. Our maid service was wonderful. The beds were hard, like everyone says, but they didn't bother me a bit. I slept wonderfully every night. It got a little loud towards morning. First, you'd hear the jungle - birds, monkeys, whatever. Then you'd hear the water turning on in other rooms, doors slamming, etc. I didn't mind getting up early, though. If you were still tired, it was all the better to doze in a lounge chair. The monkeys were fun! You are not supposed to feed them, there are signs posted. I'm sure they don't want to get them dependant on people for food. But there was someone walking back from the buffet with a banana, and those monkeys came right down out of their trees to get it. She did give it to the bravest monkey who got close enough to her. It was really a neat thing to see - he jumped back up in the tree, peeled it, and ate it! I know it wasn't the best thing to do, though - for the sake of the monkeys and their wild ways. Another person walking back with a banana, refused to give it to the monkeys - and they were really wanting to get it! The beach is eroding, no doubt. But the Yucatan has one of the better beaches of the resorts in Playa. Nature took it away, and maybe nature will bring it back again, who knows. We didn't do any side trips this time - we were just too busy relaxing and having a good time at the resort. Met lots of good people, and saw lots of people who had gotten married, or were going to get married. If I wasn't married already, this is the way I would go. Why stress over some big, fancy, expensive wedding? Take your close friends and family down to Playa, have a breathtaking background, get yourself married -- and then have a blast! You could do it all for less than 25% of a big wedding would cost, I'm sure. I would definitely go back to the Yucatan someday, but we also like to try different resorts, so I can't say I'd go back again anytime in the very near future. We've been to five AI's now, and I do like going the AI way, BUT I may be open to trying a non-AI hotel somewhere more in the center of downtown Playa.

Very good. Steakhouse restaurant - everything was brought to your table, also very good. Start out with Ceasar salad, then appetizers - chicken wings and battered zuchini sticks and mushrooms. Then came the soup - tomato and cream of artichoke together - very good. Then your meal - I had the ribs and hubby had steak - also very good. Then came dessert - Baked Alaska - good as well.

Cancun Airport is chaotic after disembarking from the plane. You are surrounded by people who want to take your bags to help you, there are several taxis and services in your face. We did what was the best thing and that was Best Day Travel. You can book them with your trip and they will take you to the hotel and back to the airport. Otherwise, unless you know what you're doing, you will be overwhelmed. Best Day was perfect. They took our bags right to the van, we tipped the guy and off we went. Depending on traffic, it's about an hour to the Riu Yucatan, Tequila, Lupita and the Palace. They are all within walking distance from eachother. Upon arrival, we wanted a room close to the beach and pool area. Otherwise, you will have to walk a bit. I slapped a $20 on the counter when we got there and told the gentleman for such a room, that my wife has a bad knee and the $20 is his if he can make it happen. Money talks, we had a perfect spot equi-distant from the pool, bars, lobby and beach. So tip well and you will be treated well. It's that simple. We were in 6101 and it was ready when we got there. We unpacked and headed to the bar and for something to eat. We returned to the room in a few hours and a bottle of Agave liquor and a welcome letter was at our door, from the management. Nice touch. We ate at the buffet since we were not there early enough for making reservations (7am) and the buffet is not bad at all. There is plenty to chose from and there are some different things every night. We ate one night at the Hacienda steak house and it was also pretty good. We did the buffet the other nights out of convenience. All of the bars have excellent bartenders that are very friendly and have a good sense of humor. I did not encounter one person at the hotel, guests included, who were nothing but nice. I guess you reep what you sow. The pools are nice, but you have to get up early for a chair. You really can't sit in it all day anyway, you'll burn to a crisp. We spent most of our time on the beach, which is probably one of the better beaches at the Playa. The Palace beach has a 6 foot drop off to the water, but they have a large area for sunning. We did a snorkel excursion that took only about 2 hours total. For $25 per person, they will take you on a boat about 15 minutes down the shoreline to a reef in only 6-7 feet of water. It was pretty cool. Just don't forget to hold onto your room and safe key. If you lose them, it's $50 a piece. The resort was constantly being cleaned and maintained while we were there, but they are never in your way. This keeps everything very clean. The rooms were cleaned and decorated each day and we asked for extra towels, soda, beer and water and left a tip every day and they responded in kind. They did a very nice job. We saw about 10 monkeys in the trees outside our room twice. They are Howler monkeys and ranged from the size of a cat to a large dog. There are also cerretes or small groundhog-squirrel looking animals on the grounds, but they are harmless. You can also find 3-4 foot Iguanas if you look for them.

The grounds are gorgeous and the varied wildlife was a pleasant surprise. One night we watched monkeys on our walk to dinner. There are iguanas and capybaras everywhere. It's fun to feed bread to the fish in the surf. First schools of small fish come for the bread, then lager fish come for the small fish, finally the pelicans come for any fish large or small. The food was good, but didn't vary a lot. We ate in the two buffets as no reservations were required there.

I went to the Yucatan with 3 girlfriends, our ages 44-51. We are from Minnesota. What a fantastic vacation at a fantastic resort I was not disappointed in the least in this resort. From the staff, to the rooms, to the food, and entertainment, I found not one thing to gripe about. It even rained the first two days we were there, and yet we still found things to do and had a great time. I can\u2019t say enough good things about this resort. Check-in went smoothly, and the front desk staff are so friendly and helpful. We stayed in two separate blocks. My girlfriend and I stayed in block 2, which was in a perfect location. Across from the lobby/reception building, with just one block between us and the pool/beach. We had a first floor room, and we were not bothered at all by foot traffic. The entrances to the rooms are set back from the walkway, so it seemed like a private entrance. My other two girlfriends stayed in block 3 and this was next to the IB Tucan, and much more of a jungely setting. They saw quite a few monkeys right outside of their room. The grounds are very beautifully landscaped. The rooms were very nice. Well kept. Plenty of space for the two of us and we are high maintenance. The toiletries were restocked every day. There is plenty of closet space, dresser drawers, vanity space, and the shower is good. There is a hair dryer in the room, but we did have to go to the reception to get an iron. The safe was plenty big enough to hold both our purses. In order for the air conditioning to work, you have to make sure your patio door is closed. Our housekeeper, Raquel, was very good and our mini bar and refrigerator were stocked daily. She left cute towel animals every day, as well. Everyone seems to complain about the hard mattresses, but I never slept better! I didn\u2019t think they were hard at all! The pool area is very pretty. Most of the chairs in prime locations were \u201creserved\u201d by 8:00 a.m. The beach wasn\u2019t so bad, because you can move your chair pretty much any place you want. There was plenty of shade if you needed it. The beach is in good shape. It is much larger than the beaches to the north of the resort. We preferred the beach because there wasn\u2019t much of a breeze at the pool. It\u2019s also more entertaining at the beach where you can watch the parasailers, the kids on the banana boats, and the people watching is great. There are two swim-up bars in the pool. There are two outdoor bars at the pool area. This area is also where the nightly shows were held. Even though people from the Tequila and the other RIU resorts came to the Yucatan\u2019s pool and beach, it never seemed crowded. No long lines at the buffet or the bars. There were not many children either. It could be that we were there before most Spring-breakers. The Anamacion team was great. They made a point of going around and getting people to join in the activities. From darts, to dancing, aerobics, to water polo, there was always something going on. One afternoon there was a beach party, with BBQ and sangria. There were dancers and music. Very fun. They also work very hard at putting together the nightly entertainment. Every day you could see them practicing. All of the staff at the Yucatan are friendly and hard working. They will do anything to make your stay more enjoyable. The reservations-required restaurants are: Steak House, Mexican and Asian. We ate at the Asian restaurant and the Steak House. The Asian was casual, buffet-style and the Steak House was a formal 4-course dinner. We enjoyed the food the most at the steak house. We didn\u2019t have any problem getting a reservation, but did make a point of making it during breakfast. The hostess is stationed at the main entrance to the La Hacienda buffet where she will make your reservations. The food at the buffet was good! It always looked fresh and appealing. None of us got sick. The drinks are also good. Each evening in the lobby area, there was a drink of the day set up to enjoy. The bar tenders were great ! They made a point of remembering what you like to drink. The lobby bar is open 24 hours. We did not do any scheduled day trips but did go into PDC quite a few times. We cabbed it most of the time. $5 each way. We also walked to the Playacar Plaza and did some shopping on the day it rained. This shopping area is across the street from the Riu Palace Mexico and down the street from the Riu Tequila. Just a quick 5 minute walk (if that). We splurged and had massages on the beach one day. It was $65 for a 50-minute massage. We also went parasailing and that was $35. Both were very enjoyable. We at dinner in PDC a few times. Once at the Blue Lobster, once at a place that locals go, and another at a place that escapes my memory!! We also partied at the Blue Parrot, the Fiesta Siesta, Senior Frogs, and the Mambo club. There is a nightly show at 11:00pm at the Blue Parrot right on the beach with fire-dancers. Very enjoyable. On the morning we left, we were surprised by a limo picking us up to take us to the airport. What a great way to end a vacation! All in all, I would definitely return to the Yucatan again. I can\u2019t see the point of paying more money for the same experience. I have stayed at more expensive AI\u2019s and have done a couple of cruises, and this place is right up there with them.

The Steak House was good but I think the buffet was better. One of our sons had his 10th birthday while there, the maid decorated our room with balloons and made a cake from towels with candies and flowers around it!! The buffet restaurant also made him a birthday cake(no extra charge) and reserved a table for us. At the end of our meal 10 waiters came over and sang Happy Birthday in Spanish to him. It was very special and memorable for him! I was impressed at the enthusiasm the staff had for his special day. The beach was beautiful, though very crowded but the sand was so white and soft. It was quite windy in the Mayan, big waves in the ocean made it impossible for snorkling or other water activities in front of the resort. We did a day tour to Xel-Ha which has snorkling and swimming with the dolphins which my niece experinced there. We also went into Cancun for the Captain Hook Pirate Ship we all enjoyed that especially the kids.I do recommend taking some gravol it can get wavey on the ship.

It always amazes me how diverse the reviews can be. I've been to almost everywhere in the south, and Mexico alone 10 times. Here is a true objective review: Hotel: Condition is excelllent. Size is not large, but all resorts combined in the package cover a large area. 5 Star in Mexico is not an international 5 star, but most know that. Food: Buffet is top notch. You will not find this selection or quality anywhere else in Mexico except the Iberostar, and nowhere in Cuba or the Dominican. The 3 reservation based restaurants are lousy, but the buffet covers that just fine. Pool: Great size, ample space, and good temperature. Beach: Best beach in Playa Del Carmen. Don't be thrown by the reviews that say otherwise. Yes, it can be very busy at peak times because the beach at other resorts is not as good, but I wouldn't trade this size, the sand, or the clear water for any other hotel in PDC. Cancun has equal beaches - i.e. Cancun Palace (a great property). Entertainment: Some good, some okay, but you're not going to find much better. Location: 5 minutes to downtown PDC, where they have some great shopping and great restaurants and bars. Not too Americanized yet. Service: Friendly, attentive, and effective. Overall, this hotel will not WOW you at first if you are experienced, but they win you over as they relly do do everything right; and by the end of your stay you will say that you were pleasantly WOWed.

We had a great time while we were there. The check in process went quite smoothly. The only problem there was that I'd requested rooms next to each other three months prior and we were in the same building but not right next to each other. They offered to move us three days into the vacation but by then it was of no use. The rooms were much more spacious than I thought they'd be. They were kept very clean the entire time. One of our rooms did get a funky odor toward the end of our stay but not too bad. The towels did smell musty but then again we were in the tropics. No difficulty with any digestive issues. In fact I mistakenly drank a full glass of the water and had no side effects. The mini fridge was scheduled to be stocked every other day but they came around every day and all we needed to do was ask and they gave us what we needed. The food was very good. The buffets had an excellent assortment at dinner especially. Lunch was the same each day but there was plenty to choose from. Breakfast was very good although I don't care for the strength of the coffee (too strong for my taste) We ate at the steakhouse one night and both the food and service were very good. We especially enjoyed watching them prepare the flaming desserts. The Mexican restaurant left a bit to be desired both in food and service. The bar staff was excellent! We really had a great time with them. Benito and Fernando were two of our favorites. They treated us very nicely. I would have liked it if there was a lite beer offering but the Corona was good. The entire staff was quite hospitable. The beach and pool areas were very crowded. For some reason I woke up early every morning and I'm glad I did because what they say about people saving chairs is true. Even though there were alot of people it was quite enjoyable. The entertainment staff was very good. They tried very hard to make sure that people were having a good time. Even though I didn't have small children with me I did notice that they spent quite a bit of time with them which was very nice. While we were there the weather was fantastic. 85-90 each day and NO RAIN! We took an ATV tour through the jungle. It was alot of fun. My daughter went to Discovery Cove and did the sea life encounter with the manatees and sea lion and dolphins. She really enjoyed that.

What a change fromt he 1.5 hour session last time only to be accosted by the time share people! Check in: On arrival we were met with a welcome cocktail and allowed to immediately checkin. I had emailed requests for rooms next to each other and the clerk was able to do this. He even suggested building 6 as we had 4 teenagers and that is closest to the pool, beach and entertainment area. Within 15 minutes of arrival we were in our rooms. Regarding building 6 if you are looking for peace and quiet this is not the building for you. There is no soundproofing you hear the partiers at 2 am and the early risers at 6am. Rooms: Standard room but very clean. The musty smell was relieved by opening the door whenever we were in it. Beds were firm but not enough to complain about. Found the curtain to the bathroom setup a little strange. Love having a balcony. We were left a towel animal only 2 days of our stay despite a tip left daily.

We stayed at the Riu Yucatan the middle week of February. Our group included grandparents, us forty-somethings, and our kids, ages ranging from 15 to 5, with one child who is autistic. I can't imagine a nicer stay. The staff was friendly and efficient, the place was spotless, and, I had already conceded to a sub-par food experience, but was not only pleasantly surprised -- I was knocked off my feet! In fact, we opted not to return to the reserved-seating restaurants; the buffet was incredibly varied and delicious. I might add, at the risk of sounding snooty, that we have travelled all over, and I am a foodie who had an upscale catering business ten years ago. And we loved it. I had read very sketchy and 180 reviews on the hotel and had no idea what to expect. It was perfect being on the ocean on a gorgeous stretch of beach. My only complaint was with our trip consolidator. We used Macy's travel service, which left something to be desired, and they employ FunJet as a consolidator. We had to listen to a drawn-out spiel when we first got there, then we had to be there the day before we left, between 8-noon, to turn in some paperwork. We thought this was ridiculous. What if we had wanted to take a daytrip during that time? Why couldn't we turn in our little slip of paper for our return trip when we checked out, or even along with our check-in paperwork? As for day trips, we went to Tulum. Not knowing what to expect, we took a cab there and a collectivo back. Although the cab driver was extremely polite and had a clean cab, it was about $40 USD, and the collectivo was super comfortable, and cost about $12.50 USD for the five of us to return back to the Riu. It was also much more interesting, mixed with locals and tourists, but not crowded, and it was air-conditioned. We also made much better time with the collectivo driver. So any of you wondering about transportation, just go to a well-marked corner near Hwy 307 and wait for one of these large white vans! It's that easy! I guess they come by about every 10 min to half hour. Tulum was great, but the ruins were sort of anticlimactic since we had just taken the kids to Rome last spring. But beautiful, by the seaside, and the beach was unpopulated and lovely. I would bring a snack and skip all the overpriced tourist traps along the route into the ruins.

If you want a fancy place with a fancy dress code and fancy meals, go elsewhere. The dining room food is good, with a fairly wide variety, although definitely geared towards the heavily european clientele. Our only complaint was that there was not more Mexican food.

PLAYGROUND There was a nice little playground with a slide and swings that my daughter loved, although she was too young to participate in the kid's club (you have to be at least 4). KID'S POOL There was a very small kid's section of the main pool that was two feet deep and my daughter was able to swim in (it was only about 4 feet by 12 feet and could get crowded, though). The Riu Tequila accross the road had a wading pool that my daughter also loved. MINI DISCO There was a mini disco each night where kid's can go up on stage and dance. HIGH CHAIRS The dining room had plenty of high chairs. CONS THE BEACH The waves were too strong for wading - and there was a drop-off after going in that made the water unsafe for little kids.. My daughter was terrified of the ocean. She loved building sandcastels on the beach - however, the beach was so crowded during the day that there was often no room for her to play. People bring their lounge chairs up to the water's edge, and there are always a lot of people walking up and down the beach, meaning that my daughter nearly got run over when she tried to find a portion of the beach to play on. We wound up avoiding the beach until after 4pm, when it cleared out and became much more pleasant for playing. It was really dirty by then, though - covered with cigarrette buttes and trash that people don't bother to throw out. KID'S CLUB The kid's club was not very well supervised and I would not feel comfortable leaving a child there. I was frequently in the playground of the kid's club with my daugher, and observed that the staff person in charge would leave all the other children unattended while she would go to get something or take another child to the washroom. Also, the gate was always left open and people constantly used the playground/kid's club area as a short cut, meaning that anyone could come in and nab a child, and that young children could run out. THE FOOD My daughter absolutely hated the food. They use some sort of very strange tasting oil or margarine in almost all the food that gives it an unappealing flavour (my husband and I found that many otherwise tasty dishes were ruined by this oil). This meant that she wouldn't even eat kid staples like plain rice or pasta. She also wouldn't touch the french fries or the pizza. She didn't even like the bananas because they tasted different from the ones at home. Luckily I brought some food for her, and I was able to buy some yogurt and applesauce in Playacar, but feeding her was really frustrating. Also, they do not serve real juice at the resort at all, except for at breakfast. There is only some fruit flavoured sodas. We had a hard time buying sugar free juice at the stores. I would recommend bringing juice from home. THE ROOMS The rooms were nicely decorated, but had terribly uncomfortable beds. My biggest beef is not that the beds were hard (which they were) but that they were covered with a plastic mattress pad under the thin sheet. This meant that all three of us sweated all night long and woke up in wet puddles. This was even with the air conditioning on. Something about the nature of plastic sheets causes sweating even when you are not cold. Also, we had hoped to read and play games on the balcony after our daughter went to bed, but were not able to do so because there is no light on the balcony. I would recommend bringing a light or candles as I saw that some other guests did. CONCLUSION In all, we had a really good time at the Riu Yucatan. It was a fun place with helpful and good natured staff. The grounds and buildings were beautiful. The Playacar area was really safe, and we felt comfortable walking around the neighbourhood with our young daughter.", "Date": "February 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central Illinois", "Title": "\u201cHated to leave!!!\u201d", "Author": "JTMAVS", "ReviewID": "UR6765710", "Content": "My wife and I just returned from what we'd describe as the best vacation ever!

This was our first stay at a Riu, and we have no complaints. The staff is super-friendly and helpful, the food is great, and the beach/pool areas are very clean. The Yucatan is a bigger resort than we normally like, our room was the furthest building back and on the 3rd floor. That being said, resort size is just a personal preference and in no way reflects badly upon the resort. We traveled with a large group (as we do every year) and we heard not one complaint. Granted, we're a pretty easy going group, but really there was nothing sub-par about the Riu. Some suggestions if you go: 1~ remember to bring your own insulated cup. The ones provided by the resort are small and non-insulated. 2~ you will need to be up early to save a chair by the pool or beach as is true w/ most resorts. We were down on the beach by 8:15am every day and had no trouble finding a group of chairs together. 3~ to use any of the water sports, you will first need to go to the small shack on the beach. There you will fill out your name, etc in a book and they will hole-punch your wrist band. From there, all you will need to do for the rest of your vacation is go right to the check out booth for boogie boards etc. We did notice that many people checked out boogie boards and then returned to their chairs with them after using, effectively keeping them all day. We thought this was really rude considering there was a list of people waiting to use them, but hey...there's no accounting for politeness. For this reason, if you want a boogie board, I would suggest checkin one out early, or you may not get one. Overall, the restaurants were very enjoyable. Of the 3 a-la-carte places, the Steak House was our favorite. The Mexican and Asian were very nice as well and provided plenty of food. The buffet was incredible, and if you're a seafood & fish lover, you'll be in heaven !!

The Riu Yucatan is not the Palace...(stayed at Riu Palace Cabo San Lucas and was a bit weary about the Yucatan) but it turned out to be a great place to stay, why? The food is good, the hotel is wanderfully clean, and spacious, the gardens are beautiful and the beach is stunning!!And the staff is one of the very best!! It is a fun-filled place, full of life...We have wanderful memories. I would though say, that it does get crowded on the hotel grounds..the beach was fine and we always found plenty of lounge chairs.....it was hot, hot, hot and the ocean was amazing to swim in. The pool on the other hand, even though there are 2 pools it was congested...our kids played alot in the pool and we stayed on the beach so it worked out fine...it is really personal choice. There was plenty of activities...parasailing, scuba diving lessons, banana boat...and the list goes on!! Really there is no boredom!! The kids especially always were busy with acitivities, and the shows are really,really good. As for the drinks, I saw alot of people with their own mugs, honestly I dont think you need one, once again personal choice. I do suggest though, to try the other restaurants at the resort because the food does get repetitious, but it was still very good. In all, it was a great vacation!! I strongly recommend going on the pirate ship - \"Captain Hook's\" that was truly the highlight of our trip!! Shopping at 5th Avenue and Xelha!! All fun!! Like I said, If you are looking for the elegance, luxury and relaxation of the Riu Palace then the Yucatan is not for you...I would definitely say though that being a Palace vacationer myself....the Yucatan was an extremely wanderful experience and I highly recommend it!!

We left from Saskatoon on the 28th and despite the crash of the computer system Canada-Wide which caused over an hour delay in take off, the flight was uneventful. The plane was cramped and I'd probably not fly with that airline again, but that isn't the point of this review.... The Riu Yucatan was beautiful! We arrived in Mexico and went through customs and immagration very quickly and the staff there were very helpful in finding our correct bus. About 45 minutes on the bus and we arrived at the Riu Yucatan, greeted with a rose for the ladies and a \"welcome drink\" for everyone. Check in was a breeze, right up to our rooms within 10 minutes. Then since we got there about 5:00 or so, it was already getting a bit dark, so we just sat at the Tequila bar until supper was open at 6:30. The buffet was very impressive, food was great, despite what some other reviewers have reported. Honestly we didn't know how people could complain at all about it. The weather for the week was ok, the first couple of days were perfect, and then about Wednesday it became windy and overcast. We went on an excursion that day to Tulum and Xel-ha, and we missed out on all the rain that the resort got. It was an amazing day seeing the ruins of Tulum and snorkelling and seeing all the fish and cenotes at Xel-ha. One mistake we made at Xel-ha was turning in our snorkelling equipment too soon - we turned it in before we crossed the floating bridge and didn't get to go in and swim in the cenotes. So keep your gear until the end of the day if you want to swim in those. Thursday and Friday and Saturday were pretty good days, though a bit windy, but there was no cloud cover. It made the heat bearable with the breeze, but be careful with putting on your sunblock - you don't feel the burn but you should put on more sunblock periodically throughout the day - more often than not. There also was reportedly some sharks in the water on the more windy days, so just be careful... The staff and animacion team do a fantastic job in keeping you occupied during the day, but don't push you if you don't want to participate. My boyfriend won the Ironman contest one day and for the rest of the week the Animacion team called him by his first name and joked with him everytime we walked by. The bar staff is excellent - they do their best to keep your cups full and try to teach you a bit of spanish if they can. Although they say tips are included, it is definitely appreciated if you give them a little something - then they treat you like gold and remember you all week - will never let your glass go empty unless you want it to. We went over to the disco at the riu tequila on Saturday night (our last night) with another couple and it was okay, but unless you're there to dance it's nicer just to sit at one of the bars at the Yucatan and chat with people from all over the world. We went into the city to go shopping on 5th avenue one evening and I definitely think it was worth it. There's lots to see, and great shopping - though the shops do tend to sell a lot of the same things and it does get repetetive. There are lots of places to get your hair braided there, and I actually got one of them down to $70 US with extensions whereas at the resort it would've cost me $77 to get braids without extensions....so I think it is definitely worth it to go see 5th avenue even if you don't buy anything. It's very different to see so many people driving around on scooters and atvs instead of all just cars and trucks - something we don't see up here in Canada!! The nightly entertainment was excellent, some of the best dancing I've ever seen. They work really hard to put on great shows for you. The only show that we didn't really like in comparison to the others, was the Grease show. The dancing at the end of it was good, but we could've done without the fake singing/acting to the soundtrack....it could've been better. You do need to save yourself some beach loungers pretty early in the morning, even though there are signs posted asking people not to. But if you get down there by about 9:00 you should be able to find a pretty good spot. We saw a bit of the wildlife there, lots of iguanas and tureques, and a couple cats, but we saw no monkeys at all. The rooms were perfect, always clean and lots of room. The beds are a bit firm, but if all you have to complain about is a firmer bed, then I'd say you have it pretty good! I didn't find them bad, we always slept really well at night - and if you're chilly (we had our AC and fan on all the time) just grab one of the fleece blankets from your closet and put it on the bed and the maid will make your bed the next day with it underneath the coverlet. We brought Gastrolyte (like Gatorade, but less sugar) with us, and glad we did because we both got a bit dehydrated on a couple of days and it makes you really tired and light headed, especially if you spend all day in the sun. The Gastrolyte replenished our electrolytes and made us feel almost instantly better so we could enjoy our whole week there. All in all we had a fantastic vacation and next year we will be going back for two weeks instead of just one - there just isn't enough time to go and see everything you want to in one week!

We booked with Sunquest - took advantage of their 12 & under stay & fly free which meant we only paid $265 Cdn for our son - what a deal! Flew on Skyservice from Winnipeg Canada - as per most charter flights, it was a little cramped but the 5 hour direct flight went pretty quickly. (Hot food provided but not too appetizing). We arrived at the resort about 1:00 p.m. and were the only ones at the check-in desk. The clerk, Carlos, was enthusiastic and gave us a great first impression. Our room wasn't ready but we went for lunch and by 2:30 p.m. we were able to get into the room. Here's my impressions of the week. 1. We were in the 3rd bldg on the main floor. The room was spacious and convenient to the beach & restaurants. Liked the patio overlooking the greenery. Fridge always stocked with water & whatever else we asked for. Large bathroom/closet/change area which was convenient when people are getting up at different times in the morning. Requested rooms next to the other family we were travelling with and this was accommodated. 2. In spite of many comments re: the beds, we found they were just fine - had the best sleeps I'd had in a long time! 3. The resort was incredibly clean. I would sometimes be up at 7:00 a.m. and the staff would be scrubbing down the place. It was immaculate. 4. One of the boys in our group has limited mobility. We let the resort know this in advance, they provided a wheelchair & our room was located in a spot that ensured everthing was accessible & easy to get around. No problems whatsoever. The resort was a good size - not too big & not too small. 5. The walking paths & bridges were lush & scenic. Enjoyed watching the monkeys in the trees, (especially the baby monkey), right outside our room. Also a few cats, & being a cat lover, this was fine with me. Appreciated how the resort seemed to co-habitate with the animals on the property. 6. I loved how the pool was located right next to the beach. We would get chairs that were right on the edge - you could turn your chairs to overlook the ocean or the pool (someone in our group would get up at 7:00 a.m. so we could get 6 chairs together in the spot we wanted but no big deal - it's nice to be up when the beach is quiet). The beach was wide & long - you could go for a nice hour walk. Not too far north of the Yucatan, the beach had completely disappeared at one resort - bit of a shock if you were coming for a beach holiday! Checked out the Riu Tequila (not on the beach) & the Riu resort next door and really preferred the Yucatan - the pool/beach feature and the more casual atmosphere. 7. Weather was OK - sunny 2 days, rained all day the next and cloudy & windy but warm the remainder of the week. Parasailing & motorized water sports were offered on the beach. Some in our group wanted to parasail but it was only an option the first 2 days as it was too windy the remainder of the week. So if you want to go, be sure to do so the days the weather is cooperating!Otherwise, the wind made for great wave jumping, but be careful! 8. Food was great - tried all the restaurants but would agree the buffet was just as enjoyable - excellent fresh salsa, great selection of fish, champagne & orange juice every a.m. & delicious self-serve soft chocolate/vanilla ice cream at the beach front buffet restaurant. (My husband & the boys would get a bowl full & take it to the bar where they'd throw it in the blender for chocolate milkshakes!) Very limited use of paper plates/cups (even around the pool) which was nice to see from an environmental perspective. 9. The stage shows were so-so. There is also live music after the stage show which seemed pretty good the few nights we saw it, but didn't seem to be too well advertised so we didn't catch on to this option until late in the week. 10. Did 2 excursions - Swimming with the Dolphins at Puerto Adventuras - did the $149 Royal Swim option - it's about a 4hour excursion from the hotel, but at the end of the day, you really only spend 30-45 minutes with the dolphins, which was still great. With the Royal Swim, there are 8 people with 2 dolphins and I'm glad we went with this as you are able to experience several different swims, some that are only possible when there are 2 dolphins involved. My only criticism, it's a bit of a tourist trap with the photos & videos - sometimes it was hard to relax & enjoy, with all the emphasis on getting your picture taken. But overall, a fantastic experience. (Also, they provided a great \"ATV\" type of wheelchair!). Would consider $179 program another time - for a little bit extra, sea lion & manatee experience, as well as dolphins. 11. The other excursion was a full day through Edventure Tours. This is a company that was recommended by other travellers on this site and we were very impressed. As others have said, wonderful personalized tour and excellent value. They rented a van for the 6 of us, we had a very personable & knowledgable driver named Carlos & our guide was a young fellow by the name of Hector - both spoke excellent English. We did the zip line, cave/cenote snorkelling (bring water shoes if you have), snorkelling with giant turtles (saw 2 or 3 & some great schools of fish) , got to handle a monkey and finished the day at Yal-Ku lagoon which was my favorite. Very serene, only about 10 other people there & tons of fish. Could have spent the day there! This was the day it rained all day, but it was ok since we were in the water much of the time. We took the wetsuits offered by Edventures and we're glad we did. Edventures will offer suggestions & you can pick & choose whatever you want. to do on your tour day. We had brought our own cooler with us & packed food from the resort (from the buffet) to have at lunch, but Edventures also has a cooler & will stop at a local grocery store to pick up whatever you want. With the exception of the rain, this was probably one of the most enjoyable days of the vacation. Cost was about $65 per person and well worth it. I wouldn't go any other way if I go back. 12. The staff at the resort were exceptional - hard-working & cheerful always. They really aim to please and some went out of their way to kid around with the boys at meals, which they enjoyed. 13. Went to Playa 5th Ave one evening - $5 cab ride - it was pleasant to walk around but all the shops/merchandise start to look alike after about one hour. The shopping plaza near the resort is an easy walk and a decent diversion for a couple of hours. Only pay 50% of what they initially ask. . . 14. On departure day, we were picked up at 6:00 a.m. - an early start, but we were the first ones at the airport which meant our check-in was pretty fast and it wasn't too crowded yet. Given the # of charters etc. I found things at the Cancun airport were pretty well organized Overall, we had a great vacation & would highly recommend the Riu Yucatan & the Mayan Riviera!

The variety was very extensive and everything was freshly cooked. The choice at breakfast was fantastic, fresh fruit smoothies, fresh fruit and yoghurt, freshly cooked pancakes, doughnuts, french toast, any type of egg or omlette etc. etc.! Dinner was just as good and there was even a chef cooking pasta on the balcony where you could choose all the ingredients to go in and he would make it while you waited. We liked to sit outside on the balcony which overlooked the beautiful gardens, it was very relaxing. We didn't have a problem with the sunbeds, one of us just put some towels on the sunbeds before breakfast and we easily had about 6 beds every day. The kids joined in alot of the activites and won prizes which were presented during the evening show, there was always something going on if you wanted it. The bars were amazing, any cocktail you wanted, I tried working my way through the list but there was just too many! The beach immediately outside the hotel was the best of all the other hotels which were very crowded and there was a high drop down to the sea near the Tequila and Palace hotels. It was a lovely walk along the beach if you turned right. We did the dolphin/manatee/sealion trip which was really good but quite expensive if you have a big family. The amination team worked tirelessly and were so friendly and cheerful, they knew all the kids names and made them feel special. Christmas Eve they had a gala dinner and the effort made in the restaurant was unbelievable, fruit displays and ice sculptures and the table decorations were beautiful. On Christmas Day, Santa came in on a jetski and all the kids went to the outdoor theatre and were given a present from the hotel. We had 4 rooms in block 5 on the ground floor and were very close to the pool and only a few minutes from reception, it was very convenient. The rooms were very clean, beds comfortable and the staff made towel animals almost daily. We did go to Fifth Avenue a couple of times and soaked up the atmosphere, its very lively with plenty of shops, they do like to barter so don't go for the first price offered.

Our one week stay was very relaxing and we had no major problems. We arrived at around 1pm and were told that we would get a free upgrade to a Suite if we waited until about 2:30 which we did. Our suite was amazing, it had a living room, bedroom, huge bathroom and huge balcony. We were in building 3, 3rd floor right in the corner. It was just the right distance to the main lobby where the buffet was and to the beach/pool. Now to break it down: Beach/Pool-- The beach was beautiful, the waves were a little crazy compared to Dominican beaches but it was still great water to swim in. There were enough beachchairs and you don't even have to get up that early (i don't know what people are talking about)--- if you get there around 9:30 which isn't that early considering the sun goes down at like 5, you should have no problems finding chairs. The pool was also very nice, 2 swim-up bars but the pool area is over-crowded with families with small children so it's better to stick to the beach. It only rained like crazy for one full day so the weather was pretty good. Restaurants/Food/Bars-- The main buffet (La Hacienda) was amazing! The food was wonderful, always fresh, you never have to wait, and they had the BEST variety of fish. My only complaint is that the tables are placed too close to each other in rows, but it's not that crowded if you come at non-peak times. Don't really waste your time with the restaurants, the food is basically the same anyway but if you feel like having a nice, quite romantic dinner, go for it. The bars were great too-- very fast service, great drinks, no complaints! Entertainment-- The Animacion staff is wonderful like everyone said previously. They really try hard to make sure guests are having a good time. During the day, the entertainment is just right, not too loud and not too annoying like it can be at other resorts and at night, the shows are okay-- nothing amazing but it's something to do at night between dinner and clubbing. As for the club/discotheque-- it isn't on the Riu Yucatan property-- it is on the Riu Tequila property which isn't far, maybe a 5 minute walk. But it's so much fun to go to the other Riu's and check them out so it really isn't a problem. The club itself is awesome, the beginning of the night, they play some oldies for the older crowd and then when they leave they put on some reggaeton/hip-hop for the younger crowd and it turns into a pretty good club. Just make sure you go with a group of people, meeting people in their is not so easy when you're by yourself so make some friends at the beach if you're not traveling with a group. Complaints-- They should build more walkways between Yucatan and Tequila so the night walk from the club back to the room is not soo far. Also, if you have a free day or it's bad weather, make a trip over to Playa 5th Ave--- shopping!", "Date": "January 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aylmer, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cYucatan/Tequila Wedding review, some area tours, very long post\u201d", "Author": "skilled-sparky-girl", "ReviewID": "UR6603762", "Content": "My party of 11 people stayed at the Yucatan Jan 6-13 2007. I had booked the Royal wedding package with the resort for Wednesday Jan 10. I had emailed my wedding coordinator Leona, a few weeks before I left to discuss extras, wedding cake, location, restaurant etc. I was a bit nervous because I didn't see any pictures of the garden ceremony location. I asked in the email to have our room separate from my family\u2019s block of rooms. When we got there, that wasn\u2019t the case but we were easily moved. We didn\u2019t get a room upgrade either like the Royal wedding package states, but I didn\u2019t push the matter. We stayed in room 2108, ground floor building 2, which is closer to the main hall. My family stayed in 5117, 5118, 5119, and 5107. So their rooms were closer to the bars and beach. We met a couple that stayed in the 6100\u2019s and they had a hard time sleeping while the night time entertainment was on, because they were so close to the stage. We arrived Saturday morning, and we didn't see Leona until Monday morning. The meeting was at the Palace Mexico next door. Scott and I arrived without our witnesses. Leona did give us extra time to find them. You need 4 witnesses with you that have passports and tourist cards. 1 of our witnesses didn't have a tourist card so we had to get a sub in. You receive the tourist card on the flight to Mexico. At the meeting we picked our flowers, and confirmed our location, restaurant and cake. We asked for \"regular\" music. We also asked to see the photographer\u2019s portfolio, which was quite good. The Royal wedding package is $1475 USD. Here's the catch. That is $1475 USD based on the exchange rate of 11 pesos to 1USD. We added extras so our total came to $1531. But the exchange rate was 10.44 pesos. I was shocked!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I even talked to the assistant manager explaining that there was no explanation of this in the wedding package. The RIU Playacar had an exchange of 10.10 pesos. But in Playacar market, the exchange was 10.65. So in the end, the cost with exchange was $1573. In pesos, that about 16, 700 and something. That\u2019s a lot of pesos to walk around with. The blood test was quick. We checked to make sure the packaging was all sealed first, and everything was hygienic. Leona met with us just before the wedding started to let me know where to walk, to make sure the flowers were delivered etc. She was our 4th witness, so she stayed during the whole ceremony. The wedding itself was sweet. Our garden wedding was just between the main hall, and the first block of buildings. We met the photographer just before the ceremony started. The \"regular\" music that was supplied was good, nothing over the top. The ceremony was short. A judge spoke in Spanish first, then the English translator. All 4 witnesses signed the wedding certificate plus the bride and groom (Scott and I) gave thumb prints! The ceremony started at 3pm. We took some pictures at the ceremony location, some pictures by the garden, and a lot of pictures on the beach. The beach was very crowded. We waited a lot for people to stay out of the back round of the pictures. We sat at the bar until dinner was ready at 6:45pm. We booked the Mexicana restaurant which was okay. Our table was right by the ocean which was nice, but the better restaurant was the Margarita steak house next door. We had dinner one night at the steak house during a wedding, and the restaurant forgot their wedding cake! They were pissed off! From what I overheard they did get a refund for the cake, but still. We had our wedding song played during our reception dinner, between courses. I just gave them my CD. The other weddings had their songs played after dinner before the animation team started. He was a \"live\" musician. One wedding song was Tears in Heaven by Eric Clapton. We booked the excellent Coba adventure Tour for Thursday morning which had a 7:15am start. So we requested our breakfast in bed for Wednesday morning, and we didn't get it. I couldn't get a hold of Leona, so we waited until Friday morning, but again, we still didn't get breakfast in bed. I was upset at that. No refund either because we couldn't get a hold of Leona. Our gift with the Royal wedding package was a Christmas ornament style knick-knack. The spa exfoliation also with the wedding package was a 15 minute scrub, rinse, cream. That's it. We met with the photographer Friday morning to see the pictures, but his lap top wasn't working right. So we only saw a few pictures. He agreed to re meet with us that night about 7:30pm. We didn\u2019t end up seeing all the pictures until 9pm that night, and we stayed up until 12 midnight to wait to see the prints. We had to remind the photographer that we got the wedding package. So we bought 24 pictures for $280USD (no exchange rate) and with the wedding package we got 8 more pictures and those 8 pictures came with negatives and a photo album. Tuesday was pouring rain. Wednesday we met a couple from the RIU Tequila that was supposed to be married on the Yucatan beach on Tuesday, but because it rained, they got married in the Palace Mexico chapel instead. Their pictures were inside the Palace. The Yucatan beach is very crowded. If you walk south on the beach passing other hotels, the beach is just as nice, but less crowded. I think that it\u2019s crowded because of the visitors from the Tequila. (RIU Palace Mexico is north of the Yucatan) We noticed a lot of people from the Tequila at our Yucatan restaurants. The wrist band tag is the same, so I think that\u2019s why they get away with it. The Yucatan is really relaxed and offers a lot of nature surrounding the beautiful gardens. I found the RIU Palace Mexico next door to be too fancy and upscale. The gardens are completely different. The center gazebo though is WOW! Even the chapel in the Palace is WOW! If I had to do it again, we would plan our week with the wedding coordinator so we knew exactly what to expect each day we were there. Wednesday was a right off. To have been perfect, I would of liked the gazebo ceremony and pictures at the Palace but have our room in the Yucatan. Our beds were quite stiff, but my family and I all enjoyed the food. The steak was very good according to the meat eaters. There wasn\u2019t a wait for drinks at all. Scott found that the Corona was watered down. We didn\u2019t have an issue with water, because the fridge in our room was stacked with 2-1L water bottles every day. I recommend the kitchen tour. You\u2019ll learn a lot about the employees of the Yucatan through the tour. Water sports consisted of 2 person and single kayaks, peddle boats, parasailing, but you had to pay for lessons. Speed boats you had to pay for. Scott and I did the parasailing. $55USD person. We got on a speed boat to the actual boat, drove up and down the coast waiting out turn then got to go up. You go up pretty high, and can see for miles. The night time animation team was excellent with my 4 year old niece Lauren. Plus twice a day the resort offered a free baby sitting service for about 11/2 hours. Lauren always had a blast playing there. If you bring U.S currency, bring LOTS of small bills. No one would exchange our 50s and 100s for smaller bills. Scott and I walked back both times from Playa Del Carmen. It only took us 20 minutes. Souvenirs were cheapest at Walmart in Playa, but the street vendors were close. I bought pretty much everything at \u00bd the USD they were asking for. Coming from Canada I had sunscreen in my luggage, a brand new bottle, BIG MISTAKE. Customs threw out my sunscreen and it\u2019s very expensive in Mexico. The cheapest was $10.50USD for a bottle I can buy $6 CND at home. Most places off the resort asked for Biodegradable sunscreen to protect the water and fish. We went on the COBA adventure tour. It was amazing. We went to an actual Mayan Village in the middle of no where, while there we had a gentle hike to a cenote, which was an underground pool in a cave. We had to rappel into and out of the cenote which was really cool. From there we hiked to a small hill, which we did the rip-line across a small lake, equally cool. After that we hiked back to the village to canoe the lake. Before we left we had lunch. The food was excellent. Next was the tour through the Coba Ruins. The guide was excellent the whole tour. The cost was $110USD per person. We believed it was worth every penny. We also did the submarine tour in Cozumel $100USD per person, and the Xcaret eco-park. With lunch and snorkel gear the trip also cost $115USD per person, Lauren was free. We haven\u2019t organized our pictures yet, so if you want some, my email is dmedeiros@presstran.com.

We stayed at the Riu Yucatan and loved it. The first thing that i loved about the resort was the location. Before booking this hotel we had looked around at a lot of other resorts and found this to be the most appealing which I am glad we picked becuase it was such a great location. In playa del carmen there are so many things to see and do and the other Rius are close by. When we first arrived it went smooth from the airport to the hotel. At the hotel we checked in and the first girl that was at the counter was very rude and gave us all an attitude which was not what i had expected. Other then that all the guys were very nice to us and always said hi when passing by. We ended up getting a room on the other side of the hotel in building 8 which I did not mind because it was quiet, but one of my friends did e-mail the hotel and asked to put us in building 2 or 4 which we did not get. The hotel rooms were cleaned daily which we had no complaints... we did not have much of a problem with the chairs at the pool or the beach because when we did decided to lay out we were always out by 8 am and there were plenty of chairs. Later in the day the chairs were all full. We did 2 excursions.. JUNGLE JIM which was ATVing throughout the jungle.. i loved this and would reccommend it to anyone who likes outdoors activities.. we went to an underground cave which was amazing and then to another cave which we were able to swim in crystal clear water which was very refreshing becuase it was so hott out. One of the other excursions that we did was the Xcaret park. This I would highly reccommend it was so becautiful and was def. worth the money. THere we saw 2 shows the one at night and the one at the myan village which was amazing. it was a long day but it is something if you are going to the area i would see. We also walked to 5th avenue one day and took a cab there another. If you go to 5th ave. i would NOT go at the night. The first time we decided to go there it was only me and my boyfriend. We walked there around 4ish and everyone was outside calling you and harrasing you in. Not only that but there was some people trying to sell my boyfriend things that is illegal and then he followed us which made me very nervous. After that we decided to walk back. The next time we went it was during the day and it was not as bad but the peoiple were still trying to lure you into there store...BARGAIN with them which we did and got a lot of things for cheaper. The bartenders were awsome!! although we did not have to tip we often did becasue theyy were so nice and made us so many drinks. THey were very appreciative when we gave them tips and we often did not see others giving tips which I thought was pretty rude considering they would sit at the bar all night . Other then that I would reccommend this hotel to anyone!! it was a great time and i already miss it. the weather was beautiful and only rained on the last day which was lucky for us.", "Date": "January 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Croydon, PA", "Title": "\u201cParadise gone bad\u201d", "Author": "VacagirlinPA", "ReviewID": "UR6576697", "Content": "We stayed here twice before this trip and had the best stay.

We were expecting a five star hotel and were rather disappointed with several aspects of our stay. First, the food was edible -- but not great. I try to watch what I eat and was incredibly disappointed by the lack of variety of fresh fruits and vegetables available on the buffet. The exception to this was the Gala Dinner on New Year's Eve which was remarkable -- LOTS of variety when it came to fruits and vegetables. I found a lot of the meats to be very greasy -- even the sirloin steak at the steakhouse was extremely greasy and I didn't even bother to eat it. Also at the buffet we noticed that staff does not remove all cutlery, plates and cups from the table once someone has vacated it. They only take what they think is dirty. We even saw them refolding cloth napkins that had been used and putting them back on the table. Personally I found this disgusting, and definitely not something that a 5 star hotel would be doing. So when eating, be sure to pick up your own clean cutlery and paper napkins as you travel the length of the buffet. Why take the chance of using dirty stuff that may have just been rearranged on the table? They only restock the beverages in the bar fridge in your room every second day. On the first day there my husband and I asked for 8 bottles of water as I drink about 4 of those per day by myself. They only gave us 3. So we were constantly running short on water. However, when we went to the front desk and asked for more water we were provided with more -- you just have to keep asking for it on a regular basis. The rooms were clean, but housekeeping staff didn't make any extra effort with presentation as some of the hotels we have stayed at in the past. No fancy animals made out of the towels. Also be sure to put the \"do not disturb\" sign on the outside of your door when in your room. On our first day there we decided to take an afternoon nap and after one brief knock we had an employee walking in to our room. The beach was nice. When getting in to the water there is a ledge that is kind of rocky and hard on the feet for a few feet, and then it smooths out. The pool was also nice. It is necessary to \"reserve\" your spot using towels early in the day. I would recommend investing in some cheap hideous beach towels that will stand out before you go and using those to mark your chairs. Otherwise it is very easy for people to mistakingly take your spot thinking it was their spot. For the most part we didn't have any issues with hotel staff removing our towels until the last day there. At which point we were able to pick up our hideous beach towels at the spot where they hand towels out and reclaim another spot. The animation staff works very hard at trying to get people involved with the various activities. However, they don't push you to get involved if you'd rather just relax and lounge in the sun. Also, we had no difficulty communicating with any staff members. Everyone we dealt with spoke English well enough that I could communicate with them. Plus, it's really not their responsibility to learn the language I speak. As someone visiting their country, I think the responsibility lies with me to learn a few phrases of Spanish that might be helpful while staying abroad. We enjoyed an excursion to Koba which included a tour of the ruins, a visit to a Mayan home, and swimming in a cenotes. Was definitely worth the money. I also enjoyed parasailing. The experiences that made the trip a memorable one really had very little to do with the hotel itself, but more to do with the excursions and extra activities that we participated in.", "Date": "January 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cNice place\u201d", "Author": "lookin4suninmexico", "ReviewID": "UR6517680", "Content": "I found past reviews so helpful in preparing for our stay at RIU Yucatan so I would like to provide my own. We stayed at Yucatan for 7 days between December 10-17. My husband and I are 30 and were looking for a great place to relax and celebrate our anniversary and other exciting events. The rain was the biggest let down... who knew it could rain that much in Mexico! We still managed to get plenty of sun despite the overcast weather ... and we spent quality time enjoying the beach even when it was cloudy! The hotel staff were great! We had no problems with communicating with the staff. Of course not everyone speaks english.. if you want that, go to an english speaking country. I was amazed that english was a minority language at this resort as many of the visitors were not speaking english. How refreshing that was! We were greated with a nice cold drink as we checked in. We did end up having to take our own luggage to our room after waiting an hour. They have no problem asking you to just leave your luggage sitting in the lobby with no one to attend to it. We were in building 8 - just about the farthest from the pool/beach. It was quiet but not convinient. Our room was clean and pleasant. We read reviews about the hard bed and brought our own egg crate mattress pad. Thank goodness for that! I don't think 7 days on the piece of cardboard they call a mattress would have been nice. And.. after day one, they took our bedspread and never returned it! Weird.. but we found an extra blanket in the closet. Our shower was clogged all week.. so our feet got an extra soaking when showering.. it was gross by the end of the week. The pool/beach is overly crowded and chairs are hot realty at prime times. Definitely play the chair saving game by getting up early.. I didn't agree with it but if you can't beat them, join them. Don't turn your towels in at night or you won't have anything to save your seats with the next morning since the towel shack doesn't open until 8 and closes at 5. The view at the beach is beautiful and the water is so blue. We kayaked and it was great - very relaxing. Food was great for us. We at at the steak house and mexican place.. once. It was ok but not great. The buffet was much better. I have a wheat allergy and still ate great all week! Don't miss out on the guac and salsas.. they are great. It does get crowded in the main dining room at key times. I found the animacion team determined to get people involved and annoying and rude at times. We were called lazy a few times because we prefered to read instead of play water polo. You would think those people work on commission. I was impressed with their multi-lingual abilities though. The bartenders were friendly and impressively fast. They are all very hard workers.. tip them well if you tip. They deserve it for the heat and humidity they work in. And they make great drinks! I recommend trying Santo's sangria (he's a bartender in the lobby bar) Our favorite part was the family of monkeys! They were so fun to watch for and on our last day two jumped down right next to us! This is definitely a crowded place with lots and lots of kids/families. I do not recommend this if you were looking for peace and quiet times by the pool/beach. This was more like spring break for the family. Any family with kids would love this place - they are very kid friendly. The hotel is very clean and they are constantly cleaning things. I saw one plant stand get cleaned by three different people in a 10 minute period on the morning of our departure. You may need to hold your breath like I did when going into the public restrooms. They were clean but not ventalated at all and the smell was very unpleasant. We brought some things that were helpful: Bug spray - like OFF Febreez for the musty smell in the room - from the humidity and for your clothes - they rarely will be completely dry Air freshener for the room Card games or entertainment for if it rains Egg Crate (we donated ours - didn't bring it home- good investment) shoes that can get wet and stay wet and still be comfortable (my tevas were a life saver!)

This property is located right on a very nice stretch of beach. The water is gorgeous and clear with only the occasional piece of seaweed or rock. We arrived on 15 Dec and the weather was excellent the entire week except for one early morning when it rained buckets for about an hour or so. The sun came out and everything dried out quickly. Over the years we have found that opting for the second week or later in December is the ticket for better weather. That first week can be unpredictable. We found the food to be very good--there are dishes for the more adventurous (my husband) and the picky (kids) and the more middle of the road eaters (me!) There is a small area everynight which features chicken nuggets, french fries, fried cheese and things kids enjoy. There is a large array of fresh fruits and veggies, sandwich meats and cheeses, a mexican food area, selections of beef, chicken, pork and--my favorite--grilled fish. There was salmon every night, grouper most nights, calamari most nights. Also a large assortment of rices, potatoes, steamed veggies, endless types of breads and rolls, an ice cream bar--the coconut was THE BEST with chunks of fresh coconut in it, various other desserts. There are self-serve taps of fresh water, espresso/cappucino, many juices, many sodas, BEER--pretty much whatever you want. At breakfast there was always champagne and oj to make mimosas and there is also a fresh squeezed juice bar (my fav was watermelon juice)! As far as things to do at the resort--anyone who says there was nothing to do must have never left the room. For free you can enjoy the pool and pool bars, aerobics class daily, bingo, spanish lessons, water polo, beach volleyball, volleyball in the pool, dance lessons, boogie boards, sea kayaks, hobie catamarans with a free lesson, windsurfing, scuba lesson in the pool. For a fee you can do jet skis, parasailing, snorkel excursions, bananaboat rides, hair braiding, massage on the beach, manicures/pedicures/facials. At night there is the disco at Riu Tequila about a five minute walk across the street--drinks are all-inclusive there as well. There is also a sports bar next to the disco which has many televisions, fooseball tables, air hockey, pool tables, a couple of video games and do it yourself snacks--sandwiches, nachos, that kind of thing. If you are really hot and want to cool down the sports bar is the place to go because it is air-conditioned. You can also go on the internet for 330 pesos for 20 minutes (about $3) or 880 pesos for an hour (about $9). We have never had any trouble communicating with staff at the hotel even though we speak limited espanol. The maids are usually less english speaking but bartenders, desk staff, waiters are all usally conversant in basic english and often time other languages as well. There is generally a large population of Europeans in Playa and many Canadians as well. It is really interesting to meet people from all over the world. Our boys are 24 and 15 and have always had a really good experience on vacation in Playa. This was my 8th time to the Yucatan and my 6th stay at a Riu property. Earlier this year my husband and I stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico (my second time there) which is next door to the Riu Yucatan. This is a bit more luxurious and quiet--more suited to honeymooners or people who really want tranquility and quiet. We found ourselves enjoying the rollicking pace at the Riu Yucatan a bit more so thought our kids would enjoy it more than the Palace. The walk into Playa del Carmen is less than 2 miles and through a pleasant well-trafficked area. It is about $4-5 for a cab each way if it is too hot or too late at night. The main drag is called Avenida Cinco (5th Avenue) and there is plenty of shopping, restaurants, bars, etc. to be found. If you like to wheel and deal you should go to the smaller stalls on the edges of 5th Avenue. Once you get into the main area of 5th Avenue it is all fixed price. There are small corridors between buildings and shops and there are often small courtyards with more artisan type items rather than the same items over and over. I would encourage you to check these out. There are of course the usual touristy places like Senor Frogs, Carlos and Charlies--where they get you drinking and in conga lines and going silly. We tend to steer clear of those places at this point. We like to sit on the patio at The Tequila Barrel, there is a blues band every night at Bourbon Street, there are tons of little hole in the wall places that change names every time we go there it seems--lots of great people watching. The Blue Parrot bar is pretty cool and located right on the beach. There are swings at the bar (one and two seaters) rather than bar stools. It turns into a crazy party place for the 20-somethings after about 10pm (my older son sanctioned it as cool)--think strobe lights and lots of bass. Remember for the most part if you pay in US dollars you will get pesos back so take alot of small bills. The small stalls mostly do not take plastic so save your cash for them, for taxis, tips and stuff like that. I have also stayed at Riu Tequila and Riu Playacar at different times--can you tell I'm crazy about Playa yet??? :) I've also stayed at Bahia Principe in Tulum and Barcelo Maya between Playa and Tulum. Cozumel is a whole other wonderful world of adventure too! I would be happy to answer any questions.

We had a very nice time in Riu Yucatan in September 2006. We have been there for two weeks from 10. - 24. september and do not regret coming here at all. Most of things were absolutely wonderful: Plenty of food, especially meat and fruit. The option of going to another hotel or restaurant it's really conveniant. Strong coctails at the bar make you a little dizzy. Hotel staff was very kind and friendly, maybe the room cleaning was too loud.A better knowledge of english language would be welcome. At the hotel there were animation shows each evening. They are such wonderful dancers and singers. What we really missed was the live music at the hotel a bit longer so that you could dance. Beach is never crowded, because it's big enough to find a quite place of your own. The hotel arrangement could include a sun umbrella. You can stay in the water for hours, the water had 30 degrees C. Clean water, big fish and white sand beach. This hotel has a wonderful vegetation around with wild monkeys and leguans and \"serekes\". For \"Salsa freaks\" there is a nice dance bar with live music in the center of Playa del Carmen called Bodeguita del medio. Big disadvantage of the location are billion of mosquitos!!!!!!!!

We had a wonderful time despite the fact that it rained 6 out of 7 days. I read every review on this resort before we left and had a few moments of anxiety due to negative comments. They proved to be unfounded. The resort was beautiful and the staff excellent. In response to a previous post stating that the staff was unable to speak English I must say that is absurd! The front desk staff spoke fluent English (one was even from England, I believe) plus several other languages. They went out of their way to make sure everyone was happy. Communication was never a problem. The Animacion staff also was multilingual. One tip would be to find out if they have non-smoking rooms if you don\u2019t smoke. We didn\u2019t think to do that and our room did have a musty-smoky smell. We brought a scented candle and that helped. Chair saving is an issue. I would recommend playing the game and get up early to save your chair. We did remove some towels from chairs that were sitting empty still at 2:00pm. The food was very good. Was it gourmet \u2013 no. Wasn\u2019t expecting that. There was a huge variety of foods to appeal to all the different nationalities staying at the resort and the presentation was beautiful. I really loved the pasta bar, freshly squeezed juices and homemade donuts! Oh, and I must not forget the guacamole and salsa. That was my lunch everyday. I must mention an excellent tour company that I had read about here on Tripadvisor. The name is Edventure Tours and here is their website - (---)They took 15 of us on a full day of snorkeling at three different spots. Wow! I have never seen so many fish! They will tailor the day to suit your needs for a reasonable fee. Highly recommend! There was always plenty to do at the resort but no one pressured you. If your idea of vacation is just sitting on a beautiful white sand beach watching the waves in the turquoise water (which is our idea of paradise) then you will be very happy here. The pool area is also nice \u2013 very clean and comfortable water temperature. The staff works very hard all day cleaning and maintaining the grounds.

We traveled in a group of 11 people, ages varying from 10 to 55. Over-all, we had a great time at the Riu Yucatan, and I highly recomend it! HOTEL: The Riu Yucatan is in my opinion the best Riu Hotel (with exception of the Palaces) in the area. It is beautifully decorated with great attention to detail. The Lobby is big open and spacious, the gorunds are immaculate and have wildlife actually living on property (i.e. monkeys, cats, iguanas, etc.) The hotel rooms were average looking but kept very clean. Beds were a bit hard, but that is to be expected in Mexico. The pools were also very nice and had two pool bars. My only problem with the hotel was a little problem with misquitos in our room, and the very thin doors and walls. You can hear right through to the next room. This was never a huge problem for us, as we were located in block 7000, away from the beach/pool/entertainment area. But I could just imagine the noise you would get if you were in a room closer to that area. Try getting a room away from the pool area, it was not a far walk from our room, and maybe try getting a room on a higher floor (less chance of bugs). The hotel is decorated in a luxurious manner, with a mexican touch. It is located within the resort area of Playacar, a very ritzy area. STAFF: I cannot say enough about the amazing staff here. It was the happiest staff I have ever come accross yet. They were always joking around, and happy to serve you. Our return bus transfer to the airport on our last day never showed up for our group of 11 people, (fault of the tour operator, and NOT Riu). We spoke to the front desk, and he took care of everything, we were in Cancun with all our luggages within that hour! THANKS FOR THAT RIU!!! An amazing group of people. This includes waiters, reception, bartenders, entertainment team and more. ENTERTAINMENT: The shows were okay. The team worked very hard and the shows were entertainign enough. The animation team was there if you wanted to participate, if not, then you were left alone. There is a disco at the Riu Tequila for dancing at night. FOOD: GREAT FOOD! I never had an empty plate. Guacomole 24/7! The buffet was very big and had a lot of options, I was content eating there. We did eat at the Steakhouse which had an amazing and huge sirloin steak. The Asian restaurant wasn't the greatest as I really don't like sushi, but the \"fried ice-cream\" desert was delicious. The Mexican restaurant was also good, but many items on it's menu could be found at the buffet. It is not a 24 hour all-inclusive resort! 24 hour all-inclusive for them meant tiny sandwhiches from the bar. But as I said in the begining, the food was great. BEACH: The beach had the softest white sand I had ever walked on. The weather was very windy while we were there so the ocean had many waves, but on a calm day, that beach would be beautiful. You do have to wake up early to save chairs at the beach or you will not get any. (This applies to the pool as well). TOURS: I did two tours. 1) The Coba Adventure, and 2) The F1-Offshore Explorer. The Coba Adventure was great! They began by taking us to a Mayan Village, were we got to walk around the local Mayan homes and meet a few of them. We were then taken to the \"Cenotes\" which is an undergorund sink hole. Its basically a cave in which you walk to bottom and swim in its fresh clear blue water. This was absolutley amazing! One of the best things I have ever done, and I don't swim! It was so beautiful, you couldn't not swim. We were then taken to a local restaurant for lunch and then off to the ruins at Coba. We chose Coba over Tulum and Chichen Itza because it was the only ruin that you are still able to climb. It did invovle a lot of walking, about 1 mile each way, and then the climb of biggest ruin (over 200 steps, but it was a great view at the top). That was a great full-day tour. The F1-Offshore Explorer was a 3 hour excursion in which you are taken to the marina and are picked up by the 13 passenger speed boat. They take you through a speed cruise of the area going at 90km/hour!!! A LOT of fun! First stop was snorkelling at Akumal for about 1 hour. Then back on the speed boat to another private lagoon area for more snorkelling and sipping on champagne as we watched the sunset. And then lightening speed back home. This was also a great tour and we all had a blast!!!! OFF-RESORT: We walked to the mexican street for shopping which was about a 10 minute walk from the Yucatan. And we also visited 5th avenue at Playa Del Carmen which was a $5USD taxi ride per way. I found that the vendors in Playa Del Carmen are not very flexible with their prices and heckling didn't eally work and became very frustrating. So we began to stick with the stores with fixed prices on 5th avenue. 5th avenue is also very nice at night. I highly recomend visiting the area, all shops close at 10pm. Again, this was a great holiday and I do highly recomend staying at the Riu Yucatan. It really was a true testament to the great standards of Riu resorts. They really are great resorts, and I am looking forward to staying at others in the future.", "Date": "December 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Amazing\u201d", "Author": "Shine_on_me", "ReviewID": "UR6364565", "Content": "20 of us went to Riu Yucatan for my brother-in-law's wedding!!

The Asian resturant was also very good, this one is buffet style. We never had any troubles making reservations. In the main buffet there was a lot of selections, and most of our group had the pasta bar and everyone loved it. The bars and bartenders were a lot of fun. Take your insulated mugs!!!! We never really watched any of the shows because my husband and I went to bed fairly early but we were up early. The younger crowd with is usually went to Riu Tequila, for there night life is better that at Yucatan. My husband and I went to check it out the night before we left and I wish we would have gone earlier in the week because we probably would have partied more. In the one bar they had fresh friut, sandwiches and pizza. One day we walked to Fiftth Avenue. You just go to the right out of the resort and walk for about 30 minutes and you will get there. Of course you have to stop at the Playacar for a drink since you have access to all the resorts except the Palace. We did one tour- Coba. It was really nice, but it was a full day. 7:20-6:00. I really enjoyed the day. We went in a cave, on a zip line and then to some ruins. Overall, the trip was Amazing. I hope that those of you who choose to go there will have as much fun as we did. Oh yeah, one day they have ribs and sangari on the beach. That was a nice touch and the ribs were excellent, They also had a BBQ by the pool one day and I had the best hot dog that I have ever had in my life.

The insulated mug worked out great. It's true chairs are all reserved very early each morning. Yet, people don't seem to be in those chairs til about lunch time. Don't lay on the beach-you may have someone fall on you because they didn't see you. I got fleas from either the sand or our room. They still itch after being back for 4 days. Absolutely everyone had a string bikini on or was topless-no matter their size, age, condition. There is a ton of smoking here including pipe and cigar. At check-in they give you one key but just ask for another. The shopping center down the road, Tiendas Playacar, is a rip off. The sunglasses broke after 1 day, the clothes shrunk and at the Pharmacy they overcharged me for migraine pills ($24US for 2 tablets). The shopping area by the ferry charges $11.50US for 50 tablets. There are fixed price stores by the ferry area where we felt less like we were getting ripped off. All vendors wanted cash & few offered payment by credit card. Maybe credit card would offer more protection, where available, but maybe not. Everyone wanted tips. We went to Cozumel for a day. One ferry was nice, one wasn't. Take a taxi from the port to San Francisco beach or another close to port for snorkeling. The beach at the other end of the island is good for surfing only. We rented mopeds for $20 each from Cuarto & Quinto on Calle (Street) Poder. Don't go there. My moped broke down in the middle of nowhere & it took 2 hrs for them to replace it. They wouldn't give any compensation & didn't even offer a 'sorry' for the hassle. The roads are bad too for mopeds.

The lobby area is really nice and spacious, the staff are very friendly and can not do enough for you to make sure that you enjoy your stay. Our room was very spacious with a nice balcony. We also had four bottles of spirts and a mini fridge stocked up with pepsi, 7up, orange juice and corona and water. We thought this was an excellent idea. On arrival into our room, we also received a welcome call from recieption asking us if our room was okay and welcoming us to the hotel. The room was also cleaned immaculately every day during our two week stay, the maid also left animals which she made from our towels on our bed as well, which we thought was a very nice touch. The pool area was brilliant with two swim-up bars to choose from, there was also a jacquizzi there as well. There is also a mini jacquizzi in one of the swim-up bars in the hotel. The bar staff were very friendly and would remember your drinks. They were never short of a smile or a \"hola\" which was very nice to see. The beach was lovely. The sea was so clear, we were able to see fishes swimming around us and we were only knee deep in water. The watersports and trips on offer were excellent, you could use kayaks, pedallos, boogy boards, snorkelling equipment, catarmarans (this was all included in your all inclusive package).

When I went to the desk they told me to check the next morning. The next morning we were moved to a room with a king size bed in building 1 top floor. Very worth it. Lobby - Beautiful and clean. The lobby restrooms were very clean. Lobby Bar*** very good service, the bar is on the small side. This is also were you enter the buffet. Great sitting areas here also. The grounds are very well kept and very clean. There are many cats around the resort and also some kind of critter that stays there too (we heard the term \"Rabbit Rats\"). We never did see any monkeys. Room - Very clean and a new towel animal on the bed every day. The beds were typical mexico - HARD- we asked for a mattress pad and they did not understand. Asked them to make the bed softer and they came and put blankets under the sheets, this helped a great deal. Never ran out of hot water for the showers, had good water pressure, clean towels every day. Pool- very nice, clean 2 swimm up bars and a hot tub that was not hot. Lounge chair hogs do take chairs and not show up for several hours. Bars here are great and fun. Beach- not much to say. You do share the beach with persons staying at the tequila. There are topless on the beach. Not much shade on the beach and no service for drinks. This is a great beach and you can walk for quite a distance. Resturants- Remember they have 2 seatings a night.

As we explored the vast hotel grounds we came across fascinating wildlife everywhere including; monkeys, sorekii's, lizards and iguanas! It was like a tropical paradise! The best was yet to come when in the short distance was the white sandy beach and the clear blue Caribbean Sea , words cant describe its beauty! Bars are never to far away with 2 swim up bars and two beside the pool. A buffet is also almost always open during the daytime for a bite to eat with a delicious selection to choose from! On the breathtaking beach, the amouny of activites to participate in are great. Including volleyball, body surfing, kayaking, wind surfing, parasailing. snorkelling, scuba diving and so much more! One reason I would recommend staying in the Yucutan over the other Riu's is that if you stay in any other (excluding The Palace) you have to get a mini golf caddy sort of vehicle over to the beach as they are on the opposite side to the beach. However these caddy's go constantly up and down all day until 5pm so dont fret! The night time shows are also very entertaining! One in particular, Michael Jackson Tribute was amazing! Thouroughly enjoyable! If they are not your scene, there is a night club across the road in the other Riu which is really good too. The fact you are able to go literally across the road from one Riu to another (excluding The Palace) is also a great idea as you get a change of scene if you want! I cannot stress how completely safe and secure you feel walking across the roads at night time!

The primary change at this resort, they no longer cater to the upscale dinning they offered in the past. We have also stayed at the Riu Playacar twice and the Riu Palace once. My thought is that Riu is feeding their upscale resorts (the two palace resorts) with all their staff and letting the Tequila, Yucatan and Playacar resorts go with regard to dinning. Too bad, that is what made them stand apart from the rest. Men no longer need to wear long pants at dinner, short are fine. I did see the headwaiter ask a man with a tank top to please leave to put on a shirt. He was asked in the middle of the buffet line. There is no more personal attention while dinning, sit anywhere, get your own drinks etc. I actually wore sweat pants after a few nights of seeing everyone else do it. I felt bad for those folks who dressed up; they looked out of place among the casual diners. The food was good, limited options, but flavorful. The service at lunch by the pool was less than acceptable. Too many people, not enough help to keep food/cups/cappuccino machines functioning. Lunch felt like cattle in a barn. Our room was upgraded to a suite on the 3rd floor of building six, upon checking! That was nice, the room was great. We did loose power twice in our building, maintenance was right there quickly to correct the issue. The crews cleaning the lobby, pool, bar areas and beach daily great a great job. The place looks as clean as it did in 2000. New pool area was a good addition. The beach was very crowded, the water was warm and everyone enjoyed. We did get up everyday for sunrise at 5:45am, our prize; we reserved great seats at the pool by the stairs to the beach. Darn chair hoarders, if you can\u2019t bet them join them. The resort is great for the price; we paid $809 per person for the week with air out of Manchester NH, through Dulles on United. All went well we would do that route again. We did see a few weddings while there; they have them by the lobby, not on the beach. I\u2019d pass if you were looking at this place to get married. They really don\u2019t have the facilities to do it right for you. Overall, we spent a week with many different cultures and life styles.

So here is my middle aged white working class male review. First let me say that we have done many other all inclusives in many other carribean locations and we have come to know what can be expected and what is not to be expected. 1. We didn't expect to wait in line in customs at the Cancun airport for an hour. Apparently it has to do with what time your plane lands if it is one of the last like ours was then you have to wait if your plane is early than I guess this isn't a issue. 2. It took 45 minutes to get to the Riu we arrived at 12:30 and I really didn't expect to get our room right away since check in isn't until 3 pm so I was surprised that we received a room immediately I was also surprised that we only received one key, but oh well we made it work. 3. We were in the the #8 bldg which is about as fart away from the pool and ocean as you can get this was about a 5 min walk to the pool which wasn't a big deal for us if it is for you you might want to try for bldg #2 or #5 which is right next to the pool. The nice thing is that we were a 1 min walk to the main restaurant \"La Hacienda\" Our room was clean with good air conditioning and a ceiling fan the beds looked like a king but instead were 2 twins that had one head board and yes they are hard but we have experienced that at all the places wev'e been. There was a little bit of a musty smell but I think that should be expected since the humidity is high all year round. One thing I didn't care for was when they cleaned the rooms they left the door open allowing mosqutos in which needed to be killed every night. They have a mini bar that they restock every other day with water, Corona, Pepsi, 7 up and orange soda, check the bottle caps we had a couple 7 up's with rust on the inside of the bottle cap. The shower was fine but be careful they don't have anti scald and it is possible to get burned. The safe was old but it worked. All in All the room was what we expected. 4. The grounds were plush with little signs of hurricane damage from last year. I didn't see the monkeys but I had others tell me that they did. 5. Ocean, The Ocean there is gorgeous there is a little bit of coral on the bottom you just need to be careful. I did the jet ski on the last day it was $55.00 for 30 minutes and it was a blast. 6. The Beach, You will be overwhelmed by the beach I am not kidding when I say that the beach at the yucatan has about 600 lounges and on a sunny day they are all full and not with the guests at the yucatan it turns out that the riu tequila which is across the street has a walkway for there guests to go there and the riu palace which is next to the yucatan also uses that beach so when you read reviews about getting up at 6 am to reserve your lounge they are not kidding. My wife was out the door every morning at 6 to get our favorite places by the old pool. Also this makes the lunch line at the Yucatans beach side restaurant very congested. We went back to the La Hacienda several times because they kept on running out of food at the beachside restaurant. 7. Pools. They have two pools they are right next to each other with the newer of the two being closer to the ocean. They did the activities in the newer pool so if you like it a little bit more quiet I would suggest the older pool. There also is a lack of filtration on the older pool which is what I think was the cause of a rash I got after a couple days there. And the reviews are correct the pool water is very warm. 8. Food. The food was probably the most disappointing part of the riu yucatan. After the second day it becomes obivious that there is very little variety in the meals. The eggs at breakfast were always runny and I even tried tipping the guy cooking them $1 to cook them better but it didn't work. The sausage was always cold and the bacon was under cooked. Lunch was even worse, Hot dogs that were always cold and some sort of hamburger that was undescibable and then they always had some sort of fish which was alway very greasey. Dinner was not much better we even tried the dinner at the riu tequila and there was more of a variety but it was tasteless. If your looking for good food, I would skip the riu yucatan. 9. Specialty Restaurants. What can I say anyone that has raved about them needs to have there heads examined. The Mexican, Steak and Asian are all horendous, but don't worry if you don't eat it the wild cats will jump right up on your table and eat it for you as we observed the night we were in the Mexican. In concusion, if your not concerned about good food, getting up early for a place by the ocean or pool. then the riu yucatan would be the place for you. If you go on vacation expecting decent food and not being rushed to enjoy your vaction then I would not suggest the riu yucatan.", "Date": "November 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston,TX", "Title": "\u201cGood deal for the money\u201d", "Author": "Readyforfun29", "ReviewID": "UR6133255", "Content": "My husband and I celebrated our 2nd year anniversary over 4 days at the Riu Yucatan recently. We had a great time. You really get what you pay for and even a little more! I read the forums and reviews weeks before going on this trip and hated to read anything bad about our future destination. My husband and I are not picky people and sensitive eaters, so we ended up making the most of our vacation and had a great time overall. Hotel: The hotel was very clean and what I would consider a medium size. The grounds are lovely and well kept. Lobby was beautiful. Staff: The majority (95%) of the staff were exceptional. Always smiling and spoke english pretty well. There were a couple of staffmembers that were maybe not feeling very hospitable but we didn't get too worried about it. We did tip bartenders and waitstaff if they were over the top and didn't see too many tippers. Beach: The beach was beautiful. If you want to be closer to the water there is NO shade. Just depends if you care about that. There are many, big palm trees as soon as you step on the beach that can provide shade. Also saw a few umbrellas that people brought themselves for shade. Pools: Pools were nice and big. People get there EARLY (between 6:30 and 8am) to get spots under the palapas and around the pool area. They just leave towels and sometimes their belongings on the beds. No one seems to mess with others stuff but you can never be too careful. Food: I love asian food and was dissapointed in the Shanghi restaurant. It seems weird to me to have to make a reservation for a buffet (small buffet) selection. The restaurant was not very big and the night we went, there were several empty tables. They tried to have a little bit of sushi, egg rolls, and rice. The taste was bland and it would have been nice to have a better selection. The sSteakhouse was good. Of course the ribeye is naturally a fatty cut of meat, and at this restaurant - it seemed to be more fat than not. But overall good. I think our favorite was the La Hacienda. It was the big buffet style restaurant there. Lots of selection! And the food is pretty good. And you don't have to hassle with reservations. Entertainment: The nightly entertainment was wonderful! They tell you what kind of show they will be doing during the day for the night entertainment. If it doesn't sound good to you then you don't have to go. But you should give it try. They seem to work themselves very hard and do such a good job. There are several bars to choose from, which is good. It would have been nice to have an area where they have pool tables, TV's and maybe other games, ect. Only because if it happens to rain like it did on our last day from around 2pm until 9pm ... you could have something else to fulfill your time besides watching the rain. Rooms: We told them it was our anniversary and asked for a complimentary upgrade and got it. We originally had a regular room and got switched to a suite. Very nice of them to do that. We were in block 5, facing the pools and ocean. It was a beautiful view - you just have to look past all the palm trees that are in front of your windows and balcony. Better than not having a suite like that. Our rooms A/C was not cooling and we had to complain twice. And the windows were a leaking somewhere because after the rain - we had small water puddles near the big windows. Yes, they could have moved us somewhere else but we didn't make a big deal out of it. We were hardly in the room and it was fine. And last.... the city/shopping: We went into the city of Playa to go shopping and have dinner. First of all, down 5th avenue - there are lots, lots of nice/americanized restaurants that are not cheaper by any means. The prices vary but if they look like they would be nice to try out, they most likely will be nicer price-wise. Still cool to try out if you don't mind spending, some of the places were really neat inside and pretty at night. I know they have \"hole in the wall\" places that are good and cheap, but we went at night and didn't want to get too off track of where the happenings were. There were lots of tourist/people out until 10pm or so just walking and hanging out in the city. The shopping was alright. The prices are not the cheapest, some don't even bargain with you. They know someone else will come along and pay what they want. We did find a store that had good prices without having to haggle. Some of the items were even $5 less for the same thing just a couple of stores further down. And there were some cool hotels that looked like they would be romantic/secluded in the city. I'm sure they are not all inclusive but worth looking into if you want to not go all inclusive and be in a that area. Hope this review helps --- overall we had a good time and would come back to Playa del Carmen for sure. But stay in a different hotel to see what else there is out there.", "Date": "November 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cCan't Go Wrong\u201d", "Author": "izzamracop", "ReviewID": "UR6132102", "Content": "Great hotel and location.

I would have received the same service regardless if i tipped but having American blood in me I just had to go against the norm. All in all a great hotel and service.

The pools were great, but gettting a spot to sit was hard until I started saving us one before we went to eat breakfast in the morning. I have gone through many of the reviews on this site and agree with some of the complaints. The towels do smell and the beds are firm, but you can get a cover for the bed and it makes quite a difference. The Animation staff was great, unique in their many different personalities but all in all a great group. We went there to relax but not sit around all day and do nothing. The Animation staff did a great job running all the events, they took everyday games and made it fun for people with all different skill levels. I personally enjoyed the water polo, the volleyball and the shooting(once I figured out the site was off by an inch and a half..aim low).

The sportsbar at the Riu Tequila was great for the occasional break from the heat. Of course, there is also lots to do nearby if you can't lay on a beach for 7 days. (like us).

If you don't want a language change, a cultural change, a climate change and some culinary variety, stay in downtown Chicago. Don't travel to another country.

We had both been to Mexico a few times before, but never to the Caribbean. The grounds are beautifully kept, and the beach was breath taking. When we initially entered our room there was a bit of a smell-I attribute this to people smoking in the room, but once we opened the sliding door for an hour or so the smell was gone. The pool area was wonderful, and we spent much of our time at the swim up bars. Ricardo-the bartender was excellent, and took great care of us. There was the notorious lounger problem. We never could find a lounger by the pool, probably why we spent most of our time in the swim up bar or on the beach. There were quite a few topless sun bathers, but as my husband said after seeing it for a few minutes it becomes no big deal. Alot of Europeans and people from the UK stayed while we were there. We only ran into two other American couples. We made great friends with two couples from the UK, who kept us laughing the entire time we were there. We took a trip to Cozumel for snorkeling, and can say it was the highlight of our trip. $20 for a roundtrip ticket on the ferry to Cozumel, and we paid $30 each for snorkeling with Gaby's snorkeling tours. Victor and Alex our snorkeling instructors were wonderful. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Alas, we too had the problem with the food. Luckily, it didnt catch up with us until our last day. We had prepared ourselves for being overwhelmed with Mexican food, but this did not happen. The buffet features pastas, pizza, and some meat dishes. Along with fruit and some salads. We had to venture into Playa del Carmen to have some great Mexican food. We mainly stuck with the Pizza, breakfast buffet was much better with an omelet station and plenty of bread. Luckily, it did not ruin our trip, but is dissapointing when you pay for all inclusive. Pepto Bismol saved the day. Overall we had a great time.

We can have a blast in a paper bag if we have too, but NOT when we have been poisoned by food/or drinks. We are smart enough to not drink the tap water-and we did not.

We tried to make the best of it and venture into Playa one day, and when asked by a waitress why we were not eating much--we explained the situation. She had heard the exact same from employees there and knew where we were staying BEFORE we told her. If you do decide to stay here, be aware of the food. The food is beautifully presented, but I would suggest not eating seafood and be smart about eating things that might have sat out for a while. The beds are hard as rocks but were remedied by requesting mattress pads. They do have a gorgeous beach and the pool looked like fun for the other guests.

The hotel is quite big with lush green vegetation all around and is really nice. The rooms were nice and well kept and cleaned. The little rat/rabbit like animals running around freely was nice to see and it was wonderful to see monkeys in the trees which are native. The staff were the nicest ever and very warm and genuinely friendly. Food / Restaurants - I am a vegetarian and a fussy eater but had no trouble getting something to eat as there is such a big variety to choose from but maybe had we been there for 2 weeks I would have struggled towards the end a bit as it may have become a bit repetitive. The food was very well presented with excellent hygiene standards so no fears there. The specilist restaurants though nice were a bit limited for me but my husband was happy enough with them. Beach - Lovely, wide sandy beach but the sand is not white but golden. No stones and is well kept and clean. Whilst we were there the sea was mostly quite aggressive with waves which was fun if thats what you like. When it was more calm the water was a nice bluish colour with good visibility however a little cloudy so its not postcard perfect clear turquoise waters but lovelyl nonetheless. The first few steps into the sea could have been a bit softer and not shelved but then the further out you go the better it gets. There is no shade on the beach. Overall the beach is lovely but not quite Antigua. Nice enough pool with plenty of sun loungers all round though they get taken early particularly the ones with shade. Nice swim up bar. We spent most of our time on the beach. We went into Playa del Carmen a couple of times which was nice as its only 5 mins away in taxi that costs $5 each way. The shop keepers really do pester tourists though but you get that most places. We went to see the well known Blue Parrott Inn/hotel a beautiful bar set right on the beach and very relaxed with lovely chill out music and swings at the bar - all very surreal and well worth a visit - couldnt help but wonder how many people fell off the swings after a few ! they do 2 for 1 on drinks from 7 - 10pm which was good ! We went to Cozumel and went to san franciso/paradise beach which was nice but a bit over rated and struck me as a place that could get a bit loud and maybe roudy but it was nice nonetheless. I just really wanted to Cozumel for the 45 minute boat trip accross and ended up at this beach ! If you go dont take return ferry tickets get singles so your not restricted as to what time you have to come back. Edventures - without a doubt our best day trip was with [-] - a must so check them out. Its a full day tour which includes snorkeling in cenotes, with tropical fish, snorkelling in lovely Akumel with turtles, snorkeling with a beautiful lagoon with tropical fish, Zip line in the jungle (though I chickened out of this in the end as I suddenly became scared of heights ! ). Its particularly good because these people Bonnie and Ed are local and take you to the most beautiful places others wouldnt in very small groups (4 in ours) and are very laid back and not big commercial companies. Great value as well for all you get. If you only do one trip do this ! Just read over what I said and it feels like I am on commission ! Hi Bonnie and Ed if you have read this ! We also had a massage on the beach which was very enjoyable in a beautiful setting though be warned they may \"massage\" parts they shouldnt as was my experience. We were lucky we had superb weather averaging about 34 degrees every day with no rain. Overall we had a lovely holiday with nothing worth complaining about at all. We got a fantastic deal with this resort and certainly got value for money. It really is lovely and in a great location and if you manage to get a good deal you certainly wont be disappointed. The only thing is we would consider it more a 4* rather than 5* as its not what you would call luxurious but it is certainly very nice and I would absolutely recommend it !

However, from the moment we stepped out of the transfer van, our hopes were crushed. At check in, we were coldly greeted by a woman named Nina. She was busy and wanted to check in three families at once. She scolded us for not getting our bags into the pile for delivery to the room quickly enough. She handed us a pamphlet, put on our bracelet, told and told us to come back at 3:00 for our rooms. Anyone in the three groups who asked anymore questions like, \"Where can we change?\" was met with less than friendly responses by Nina. We were taken to our room at 4 p.m. We had specifically asked for a NON-smoking room, as I am allergic to smoke. We asked for a room change, but we were told there was nothing available. The hotel was not at anywhere NEAR full-occupancy. So, I ended up coughing all night long. The next morning, we slept in late and decided to relax at the pool for a while. The hotel was not close to being full, so we easily grabbed a spot by the pool under a palapa. Since we skipped breakfast, we chose to grab a snack of nachos. The animacion staff passed by annoucing water aerobics would be starting in 10 minutes. \"Water Aerobics... 10 Minutes.\" As the staff member passed by us, we said, \"No thank you.\" But, that wasn't enough for this staff member. She waited until she thought she was out of earshot and then instead of saying, \"Water Aerobics... 10 Minutes,\" she said, \"No more nachos... Put down the nachos.\" Everyone around us heard her. They couldn't believe she said it. And, they also could not believe she said it in the WAY she did. Can you imagine paying thousands of dollars for a vacation only to be insulted by a member of the staff? We couldn't. So, we complained to the manager. He quickly shifted us off to the Public Relations manager. She tried for 30 minutes to convince me and my husband that the staff member was just joking with us. It was hard to believe that she was actually trying to convince us that nothing really happened. Of course, my husband and I no longer felt comfortable at the pool since the offending staff member was at the pool all day directing activities. So, we went back to the room. The PR manager eventually called us to tell us that she would be moving us to the Riu Palace Mexico. But, she couldn't do anything until the next day. We were so excited to be getting out of there the next morning. But, to our surprise, at 11 a.m., we were still being given the run around. Our travel agent tried to call the hotel's PR director six times. Each time, they would do something different. They didn't understand her English, they put her on hold, they told her they couldn't help her, they sent her around to wrong extensions. Finally, she called us and said she would be filing a complaint on our behalf since she could easily see what was happening to us. She also told us that the least the hotel could do would be to help us get our bags next door to the Palace. We ended up spending around $100 on phone calls back and forth with our agent trying to help us. We eventually got a call from the PR director saying that we could go over to the Palace now. I asked if we could have a bellboy help us with our bags. She told us that we would not get any help getting our bags next door. She told us she would call us a cab, but we would pay for it. We told her that our travel agent said she felt that a cab was appropriate in this situation. The PR manager coldly informed me that they were already doing too much for us. She said she talked to the employee and we had just been too sensitive. She let us know that she thought we did not deserve what we were already getting.and that a cab was definitely out of the question. We would also not be able to borrow one of the rolling carts, either. Fine. We just wanted to get out of the Yucatan at this point. But, checking out, they made us sign a form saying that we would not complain to our tour operator or supplier. We refused to sign anything that didn't allow us to tell our tour supplier how bad things were. But, they told us we would not be able to go back to our room nor would we be able to check out and leave until we signed it. We were so upset by this point. We just signed it so that we could leave and be done with them. We went to the taxi they had called for us. Like always in Playa, I asked how much it would be to take us NEXT DOOR to the Palace. Theye were going to charge us the same amount as to go into Playa. So, we politiely said, \"No, thanks.\" A large group was coming to check-in. And, they realized that it didn't look good for two guests to be shlepping 4 suitcases and a carry-on down the sidewalk. So, they told us to just get in the cab and go and they would pay. We left and have never looked back. The Riu Palace Mexico was amazing. IT deserves every compliment given. Spend more and get a vacation with a staff that is beyond wonderful!

Here is what we have to report. The Hotel: The Hotel its self is very pretty. The grounds are well maintined and clean. The Staff: The staff is really wonderful. Everyone from the housekeeping crew to the wait staff is very friendly and helpful. . The Rooms: The rooms are fine. Clean and spacious. There is that musty smell that everyone keeps talking about and the towells are stinky. The beds are not the most comfortable but I got plenty of sleep, so I they can't be all that bad. The Telephone/Internet: The telephone situation is insane. First they want you to buy the Riu phone card AND they want to charge you to use it... can you say rip off???!!! On the flip side I found the internet service to be very fair. $3.00 for 20 mins. Which is pleanty of time to let people know that you are fine and having a good time. Which is what I did instead of paying that insane price. The Food: The breakfast buffet was good. Lots of varied breakfast foods. There really isn't anything that I can say that was lacking or bad in anyway. Breakfast was great everyday. Lunch was also fine. I did wish that that there had more vegetables. More varied salad items. Iceberg lettuce is a little boring. Dinner- We ate at each of the resturants. First night we ate a the buffet since we arrived too late to make a reservation. Which is a little annoying. Who is thinking of dinner at breakfast time? But the buffet was ok. My main complaint is dessert. Dessert was NOT good. NOT good at all. I was so dissapointed. Our favorite place was the Mexican resturant... the food there was so good. We also ate at the Asian place-- my cousin liked it. I was not as impressed, but it was ok. The Gym: The equpiment is fine. Run of the mill hotel gym equipment. However it is NOT the cleanest of places. There was sweat residue all over everything--- disgusting! They need to have towels there for you and signs asking people to wipe the equipment down after they are done. Also perhaps asking people to use the equpment 30 mins at a time. Pool/Beach: Pefectly fine. Wasn't crazy about the seaweed and other vegtaion floating in the water. That is a me thing. I hate that The pool was fine. I wish there were more chairs to choose from. It was hard to find a place to sit unless you got down there pretty early. Drinks: Great. There was nothing I could think of that I didn't have. All in all it was a good time. While there is room for improvement, we had a good time and would stay there again.

It was such a wonderful experience! I have been reading Trip Advisor for the last 3 months. It helped me prepare so I would like to help someone else. Overall: Great experience. Great staff. Nice accomodations for the price. Very clean. Food was great. Wish I was there now. Suggestions: 1. Pack lightly. Try to take carry on lugagge only. Saves you alot of time. 2. When you arrive at airport, go directly to customs downstairs. Don't stop to shop. There was a long line waiting downstairs that we did not know about. You will have time to shop in the airport when you are preparing to depart. 3. Plan your transfer ahead of time. Much less hassle. We went straight to our representative as instructed and left for hotel. Our transfer van was on time when we left to come home as well. Tip your driver. 4. I did not need bug spray, fly swatter, umbrella, travel mugs (as others had suggested to take) Do take sunscreen. 5. Airlines let you carry on one quart size plastic bag filled with toilitries that are 3 ounce size or less. ex sunscreen, tooth paste, perfume, makeup, shampoo, gels, hairspray, etc. Have all items in one bag together. Then if you wish, you can throw away and not bring home. Also, these items are in the hotel gift shop if you want to buy them here, but they are expensive. 6. The beach is indescribable in beauty. Don't miss the sunrise. They start at 0615-0630 and are over by 0700. Might as well take your towel and reserve your chairs while you are up early. However, finding chairs were not a huge problem. It is a great time to go, not alot of people. 7. Be ready for lots of topless women. 8. All food and restuarants were good. I can't believe anyone would complain about the food. 9. Yes, the beds are hard but I asked for blankets and it helped. 10. Go to Xel-Ha if you like snorkeling and I also did the Snuba there which was fun. Do the all inclusive. $87 USD which included air conditioned bus transports, tour guide to show you what to do, all food and drinks. (Food was excellent!) 11. I saw no one tipping anywhere at the hotel. However, we tipped the lady who cleaned our room $3-4 per day and the person who filled our refrig $2. (They fill refrig every other day or when you call) 12. The animation team was good. The night shows were fun. ***OTHER*** I emailed the hotel the day before I arrived and asked for a room in block 5 on the 3rd floor with an ocean view (Trip advisor had said this was best rooms and I agree). I also asked for blankets and diet soda. I told them we were celebrating our 25th. I received everything I asked for and more! They surprised us with bride and groom towel animals, a fruit plate, bottle of wine, a rose, candy, balloons, and a mexican vase as a gift. We felt soooo special! I felt they went out of their way to make our stay special.

The weather was great for the whole two weeks. Flight and transportation to the hotel and check in were all very smooth, we were greeted with a cocktail on arrival and I was sat on our balcony having a chilled bottle of Corona within 10 minutes! We were in block four, room 4108 which was about 30 seconds from the pool area and 2 minutes walk to the main restaurant. Perfect. There were bottles of Rum, Vodka, Whiskey and Brandy in our room and the fridge was stocked with bottles of Corona, Pepsi, 7-up, Orange and 3 large bottles of water every other day. The room was just like the picture in the Thomsons brochure. The beach was really beautiful; we spent the first couple of days by the pool which was great and then went on the beach for the rest of the holiday. I\u2019m not much of a beach person but my partner is and I didn\u2019t mind at all as it was just so nice, always plenty going on with parasailing, boats going by and beach volleyball. You could take out the sailing boats, canoes and pedlos for free if that\u2019s your thing. People did reserve beds before 8am for the better areas by the pool but you could always find beds on the beach with no problems at all. Not much shade on the beach \u2013 people did make their own shade by upturning another sun bed vertically but we never felt the need. There was a shaded area near the pool if we fancied a break \u2013 it never bothered us at all. The sun is hot though \u2013 I needed higher factor creams than normal so I can imagine that if you did burn yourself one day you would need the shade the next day. Just be careful!! The first night I couldn\u2019t sleep and got up for the sunrise at 6.30am, its great if you can manage to get up. Good job I took some pictures for my girlfriend! The beds are fine by the way \u2013 we didn\u2019t find them hard in the slightest. All soft drinks are available self-service by the pool so there is no need to go to the bar \u2013 we took two travel mugs from ASDA, handy if you like being on the beach. I drink fluid like crazy in the heat \u2013 just saves your legs that\u2019s all if your lazy as the cups they use are just a standard size, fine for cocktails though. How anyone can complain about the food is beyond me \u2013 there is just sooo much choice and really well presented. I think some people make the mistake of having a little bit of everything at each meal rather than making a normal meal out of what is on offer. The two restaurants near the beach overlook the beautiful sea and in the day offer burgers, hot dogs, pizza, chicken and salads etc, these double up as the Mexican and Steakhouse speciality restaurants at night. The main buffet restaurant is open in the day between 1pm-3pm if you prefer a proper meal rather than having the more convenience food near the beach. We really enjoyed the Steakhouse and ate there twice, the Mexican was good but we never bothered with the Asian one as we were happy with the main buffet restaurant near reception. You do have to book the speciality restaurants from 7am at breakfast, there was never more than two couples queuing to get a reservation but you might have to settle for a early time (18.45) if your later than 9am as they will obviously run out of reservations the later you leave it. We never found this to be a problem. The Animation team were fantastic, im not really one for lying around ALL day so I enjoyed the daily activities and took part in the twice daily volleyball and water polo. There were also daily sand bowls, rifle shooting, darts, soccer, Spanish lessons, horseshoes, dancing lessons and bingo. The bingo was a little annoying at 4.30pm if you sat by the pool but it was fun \u2013 just everyday and giving numbers in three languages was a bit much. The Animation Team may ask you if your by the pool to take part in an activity but only for the first couple of days and they soon get an idea if you want to do anything or not, not pushy at all. My girlfriend wasn\u2019t too bothered but did take part in the daily aqua aerobics in the second week as the all-inclusive food took its toll!!! The Animation Team also performed or more often introduced the entertainment at the nightly show, they were quite good really \u2013 my girlfriend enjoyed the Las Vegas and more dancing type shows but there was a Michael Jackson impersonator and a Karaoke night. The shows are on a fortnightly cycle so your unlikely to see the same one twice, if your comparing them to a London west end show then you wouldn\u2019t enjoy them but we took them for what they were and enjoyed them. There is a dance that some people learn in the day and get up on stage each night \u2013 not my thing but fun to watch. I can see why some people might think this was a bit cringe worthy as well as getting prizes for the activities in the day but it was fine by us. We went to Cancun for a night out through the Animation Team to Coco Bongos \u2013 fantastic night out for the young at heart. It was $50 including the coach (1 hour) and entry and all drinks. Well worth the trip if you like a drink and a dance - a very different but brilliant nightclub. There were lots of cultural trips you could do as well but we didn\u2019t go on any other trips this time. One thing I didn\u2019t know how to handle before we went was tips, I kept reading about tipping the bar staff etc so took loads of $1 bills \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to appear tight but didn\u2019t want to feel I had to tip every time either. As it turned out I never saw one person tip anybody for the whole two weeks. I\u2019m not saying this is right or wrong but it surprised me, maybe it was because there didn\u2019t seem many Americans there, I guess its more their culture \u2013 it was mainly Europeans, plenty of Spanish and Germans. We tipped in the speciality restaurants and gave the maid a couple of dollars each day but that was it. We would have looked out of place to tip as it turned out. We ate out in Playa Del Carmen twice at night which I would recommend. Its only $5 US dollars in a taxi, we had a two-course meal and two drinks at an Italian for about $40 US dollars sterling including tip. Just make sure you walk to the end of 5th Avenue, there are more restaurants down there than shops and you get a better idea of the place. I wasn\u2019t too keen on Playa in the day as the Mexicans do try to engage you in conversation to get you to go in their shops and I did get a bit sick of saying \u201cno Gratias\u201d \u2013 im sure some people might like the bartering though. I thought every shop looked the same but im not much of a shopper. We went over to Cozumel for the day, $18 USD return on the ferry, very similar to PDC really and similar shops, we didn\u2019t stay long but quite enjoyed the ferry across and im sure others would make more use of the shopping than us. Silver shops everywhere. If your English I would take Pesos rather than US dollars to Playa for sure, less confusing, even better just take your debit card and use the ATM \u2013 better exchange rate (20.19 for Pesos when we were there with a \u00a31.75 fee with HSBC). As you can tell we really enjoyed it at the Yucatan, having said that I can understand why some people might find it a bit too lively. There always seems to be something going on like a beach BBQ or serving cocktail from huge Coconuts by the pool. If you prefer a pool and beach that is very quiet and tranquil then it might be a bit much for you \u2013 there is a new Riu Palace that has recently opened a few hotels down which looked fabulous but we wouldn\u2019t have swapped the more luxurious surroundings and quieter atmosphere for the fun at the fantastic Yucatan.", "Date": "October 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Wales", "Title": "\u201cLoved the hotel\u201d", "Author": "AJ21", "ReviewID": "UR5890147", "Content": "We stayed at the Riu Yucatan from 12th -26th September 06 and had a great time.

The food was good with plenty of variety and presented well. I thought that the hotel represented great value and would definitely return there at some point. From what I saw of the Riu Tequilla and Playacar this was the best of the three. Some great characters amongst the staff, a great number of whom speak good English. Another plus is the wildlife around the hotel (monkeys, iguanas and little creatures that look like a cross between a rabbit and squirrel) I can't remember what they are called.The beach is beautiful , the sea is so clear and warm. Lots of fish close to shore so it is worth trying the snorkelling. Snorkel & mask were free for an hour at a time but bearing in mind the number of people that stay there this just gives everyone a chance to have a try. We used the beach rather than the pool as it was quieter and it's just what we prefer. Only one minus point as far as I was concerned and that is the towels on sunbeds around the pool. Why!!!

We just got back (today) from a fnatastic 2 week stay at the hotel and wished we had gone for 3 weeks instead! Neither of us had upset stomachs, yes we got bitten but what do you expect in the jungle? DOH!!!!!! Accommodation: We were in block 7 (7218), probably the furthest from the pool and sea but hey, it is only a few minutes walk away. Room was great, large and spacious with two queen size beds for us, the air-conditioning was the real plus as it meant a haven from the humidity. The maid cleaned every day and we got clean towels, plus the towel animals, as well. Fridge was replenished every other day with Corona beer, orange, pepsi and soda water, as well as 3 litres of mineral water. Optics (gin, rum, vodka and tequila) were also replaced as they ran out. Balcony looked out on the gardens and it was great to watch the wildlife scurrying around out there. Food: It amazes me how folk on here complain about the food! The Hacienda has around 5 choices of main meal for evening meals, served buffet style, including Mexican, fish, meat etc. Breakfast is similarly endowed and if you want something all you need to do is ask. As to the person who complained that the serving spoons were mixed up, I hadly think that is the hotel's fault and they replaced any we found straight away. Steakhouse is really good and the steaks to die for, similarly the Asian restaurant where the choice again was good. For trying something different our favourite was teh Mexican restaurant but don't expect to get what you buy in the UK, it is nothing like that. You get local dishes such as chicken stuffed with pumpkin flowers which is really delicious by the way... Lunchtime there is a choice of 3 restaurants where you can get anything from steaks to fajitas or pizza (freshly made to your design!). We never had a bad meal and certainly dod not get an upset stomach in fact we only heard of pone person suffering this and it was more a touch of sunstroke than anything else. Pool area: Yes, the reservation towels did go out early but as we had chosen to travel when the kids had all gone back to school we did not suffer too much and always managed to get a shady spot after 7.30am. There are two pools and both are warmed by the sun and it really is like getting into a warm bath and, despite a previous entry that suggested the warm water might be a breeding ground for germs, the filtration and cleaning systems really work well as does the guy with the net who fishes the leaves out the pool.... There are two swim-up bars in the pools. In the pool nearest the sea is the Tulum bar which also serves drinks to the seats under teh canopy next to it. This we found could get a wee bit rowdy when sdome of the guys had had a drop of drink but the Cozumel bar in the other pool is far better and also has the best barman in Viktor. Beach: Nice cool white sand that feels good between your toes and a shallow shelf into the sea which is as warm as the pools! Safe swimming areas are marked and, as hasalready been said, you will find lots of fish in here. So many that we even had a pelican joining us in the sea looking for a snack.... You can walk through to Playa del Carmen from teh Yucatan and it is a lovely walk with some great views of Cozumel in the distance. In the other direction you can walk to the jungle and find yourself in some deserted coves. Animation team and evening shows: I thought the animation team were grat and extremely hard working. They would start at 10.00am and invite you to play bottia ball (petanque or boules) or shooting then it is volleyy ball or horseshoes or, for the fitter folk, water polo. The big difference however, is that it is all done with great humour and the winners are invited up on stage at 9.40 each evening to receive their certificate and a prize. The evening shows were again beyond fault. Either the animation team did something like Grease (all mimed) or a specialist team were brought in. We enjoyed a tijuana evening, mayan dancers, mexican dancers, a horror night and of course the Mexican Michael Jacks, fantastic! Shows all finsh about 11.00pm so you can still get a good nights sleep. Staff: All the staff are lovely and respond even better when you try to hablo espanol. On arrival a tthe hotel you cases are taken to your rooms and you are given your hotel instructions whilst sipping your first hotel cocktail. The reps (Paul and Natalie) are fantastic and always ready to help you with any queries you may have. They do not push you into trips and no hard sell either. Trips: We did just three organised trips, to Chichen Itza, Tulum and Xel-Ha and also swimming with the dolphions, manatees and sealions. Chichen Itza is something to behold and the guides are superb but take insect repellent with you as you are in the jungle there. The tour manager will keep you supplied with free soft drinks, tea or coffee and will also give you an umbella to keep the worst of the early afternoon heat off you when you go round the grounds. Tulum and Xel-Ha are a great rip as well. Tulum is a coastal Mayan town and is very different to Chichen Itza and Xel-Ha is fantastic for snorkelling and also for having a good walk round looking at the animals in thir natural environment. If you are going to do the dolphins then take the Royal Swim as it is only a few pounds more than the others but it gives you it all, dolphin hugs, kisses, dorsal; fin pull and best of all, the toe lift where they carry you above the water on their noses. I cannot describe the emotions that go through you when you are doing this, it is just so special. Even if you are not a confident swimmer don't worry, the floatation jackets are the best I have ever used. So, to summarise, we will be going back here again as soon as we can, ignore the fact you may get a tummy upset, a change of food can do that quite easily and some imoium soon puts paid to that! It is a fantastic place for a holiday and I am just so missing it already....", "Date": "September 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Loveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cNice Beach Average Resort\u201d", "Author": "Mamie29", "ReviewID": "UR5810902", "Content": "We stayed at the Yucatan from Sept 2-8th.

Also if it is a hot sunny day the pool is like a hot bath in the afternoon. Bar staff were friendly and helpful and certainly knew their drinks. We loved all the alcoholic slush puppies and the speciality tequila drinks. There is a huge range of food always on offer, some if which is cooked fresh and how you want it. We never had a stomach upset, but a few others did. As long as you aren't too much of a fussy eater then you'll be satisfied. I loved the Asian, partner loved the Steakhouse and Mexican. We went to them all twice. Animacion team were friendly and some of the shows were way above our expectations, whilst a few were below them.

I have stayed at all of them, including the Lindo (my favorite), Beach, Tucan, and Quetzal. The food was very good at the Yucatan. The beach amazing, as pretty much anywhere in Playa, and Cancun. But the service was very lacking, and the accomadations, marginal at best. There was a pipe that burst, so for half the day, the whole resort was without water (imagine how yucky that can be!!). The pools where warm and didn't seem too clean. The service was very spotty: sometimes awesome, sometime non-existent. There is no bar service around the pool or beach, which I thought was very unusual. I stayed at the Riu Cancun Las Americas in April, and they had service there by the beach. We walked the beach and went next door to the Riu Playa Las America's and it looked much better. However, if it's anything like the Cancun, be prepared for a much older and mellow crowd.

The food is ok, but be warned, take plenty of medication for stomach upsets. Everybody that we spoke too at the resort, and even the RIU Tequila, had all had the same thing. Animacion team take a while to get going. They seem to have no \"get up and go\" with them. We have been to the RIU Bachata in the Dom Rep, and IMHO the Bachata knocks spots of the Yucatan. Advice, take your dip in the pool in the mornings, because in the afternoon it is like having a bath. This cannot be good for you, and is surely a havan for germs. This hotel looks to have it's problems, and could be beautiful with a bit of TLC.

We got the welcome we expected with everything made really easy and were impressed with the look of the lobby area. However, I am disappointed to say that it seemed to be all downhill from there. We couldn't help comparing the two hotels especially during the first week. The animacion team were lovely but just didn't seem very motivated and their prescence was very inconsistent. Ok, they do work long hours but there just seemed to be a general lack of motivation and interest. That was up until three or four days before we left when there seemed to be a transformation. They were much more visible, speaking and introducing themselves to more people and more activities seemed to be introduced. We wondered if someone had complained or if they had had a talking to. Our kids loved the miniclub and the girls in there were great. The movie in the afternoon was good for getting the kids out of the sun, but they could have used their imagination a bit more and done some more activities in and around the pool, this may have recruited them a few more - only 3 or 4 kids there sometimes. Lots of groups of teenagers but we put this down to it being school holidays, however some of them didn't appear to be supervised at times and seemed to be making a nuisance of themselves. We also felt that some of the clientele around the bar areas were loud at times too. In the main dining area known as 'The Hacienda' we sometimes found it difficult to find a table here and only on one occasion were helped out with this. We also found that on many occasions we didn't even get the minimum standard of service here and were often ignored. Not only were we frustrated with this but also found the layout of the food area disorganised and busy, very hit and miss. We laughingly christened dinner time the 'Hacienda shuffle' because of the sheer amount of people wandering around trying to find something to go with what they had put on their plates. We also noted that many people really didn't mind which utensil they used for which dish and some of the dishes weren't warm all the way through. We mentioned this to our rep because we all ended up with tummy problems and were aware that we were not the only ones. We personally didn't put this down to the sun or extra booze. Take some remedies for this or buy them in the resort because it didn't last for too long but it was very unpleasant. Following our complaint, we were glad to see staff in the dining room checking that utensils were in the correct dish and that there were enough of them. Some of the staff in the restaurant could have done with a bit more training too before they are let loose on the unsuspecting guest. We ate in the a la carte restarants twice each one. The food was nicer here and we enjoyed good service without the hustle and bustle. At lunchtime we used the pool bar where the choice of food was limited. Never saw a table get wiped though, although I could have blinked and missed it! What people really need to take with them or buy it there is a really good insect repellent. You will also need to use it 24/7. It's not just the mozzies that get you but also the ants around the pool and anything else that decides to land on you. It doesn't matter where you are or wether you never usually get bitten, you will here. As written in other reports, sunbed reserving is in full force here. If you put your towels down before seven a.m. they will be removed if you are not there, we saw this happen. If you don't reserve sunbeds at 7a.m. however, it's really difficult to find somewhere with shade for the kids. One thing I saw and didn't like was people coming along when families had gone to lunch, removing belongings and claiming the beds for themselves - this is unacceptable and ignorant. Want a bed? Get up and get one!! Cleanliness around the pool was not too good, it was busy but more could have been done. The evening entertainment wasn't very varied having lots of the same kind of shows night after night. The dancers were excellent though. It just didn't seem very organised. We just couldn't help feeling that this hotel just isn't being managed that well at the moment and really needs a good shake up.

After a 10 hour flight and quite a wait at Cancun airport, we arrived to a very warm welcome by the friendly staff at the Yucatan. The women were given a rose and everyone a cocktail. Our room was in block 2 which we found perfect. Away from the entertainment however smack bang in the middle between the pool and the restaurant. Ideal block. The room was lovely cleaned daily and the cute towel animals were great fun. The staff were so friendly and made that extra effort to speak to you and help in any way they could. I spoke to them in Spanish which they were surprised at but enjoyed. The food was great. I am a very picky eater but had no problems whatsoever finding something to eat. Very tasty food much enjoyed by my partner who stuffed his face 3 times a day bless him! Tried the Steak House which was nice and relaxing and made a change to be waited on, it was ok. Also the Asian which was nice too. Drinks great. Pool area, busy. Not a good point, however with the beach right next to it why sit round the pool when you can enjoy the view of the Caribbean Sea? God knows! The beach was beautiful, the sand pure white and the sea so warm and enjoyable. So many water sports to do and with regards to the below comment some saddo moaning about paying for motorised sports, yes you do which it does state in the brochure. So what?! They were cheap enough. I did jet skiing, kayaking and parasailing all fab. Perhaps they should be more strict with the saving of sunbeds round the pool, its pretty sad getting up so early on holiday get a life! Entertainment, mmm pretty rubbish to be honest! We sat at a table and played cards and drank lots! Some nights we ventured into Playa del Carmen which is a great little town full of hustle and bustle. I bartered with several men in the shops and got some great bargains it was so much fun! Some fantastic bars in town too check out the Blue Parrot one of the best beach bars in the world. We arranged to go on the speed boat 007 day trip and also the Tulum and Xel-Ha trip. Both were great. Speed boating was my favourtie in a convoy speeding along the lagoon near Cancun into the Caribbean then snorkelling on the 2nd largest coral reef in the world brill! Tulum good and Xel-Ha which is a natural water park where you swim with so many fish! I was a bit nervous but it was a beautiful park. My boyfriend and my dad snorkelled there and saw some huge fish and many varieties. Overall we had a fantastic holiday. The area is beautiful, the hotel was great, the monkeys and little critters as we named them walking round made it feel very tropical. Gorgeous beach and sea. I would recommend this place to anyone. We travelled premium class too which made the journey 0f 10 hours there and 8.5 hours home again good too. I can't believe some people can moan so much!

We could not relax as upon arrival and a 9 hr flight we did not have a moments peace or anywhere outside that was not in the sun to relax. Therefore our stay was spent mostly in the room with the double glazing closed. Problems: *No sunloungers ever if you don't want to get up before 7am. people would reserve 4/6 each sit there for 20 mins at 7am then go for breakfast/ walk another holiday and never return until2-4ish. Extremely frustrating and if you do not wish to sit in the sun all day on the beach then you are confined to sitting in your room to escape the sun. We managed one day on the beach when it was a little overcast and otherwise spent our days in the room with a couple of swims in the pool - hardly relaxing. * Noise levels - constant entertainment from 10am-11.30pm. Unfortunately our room overlooked the pool and stage area but when the furniture in your room shakes with the music at 11.15pm and you were up for a trip at 6am this is not fun or a holiday. phoned reception to find out what time it would finish and the girl put the phone down on me without answering my polite question. During the day you cannot escape the noise and often there are two sets of music being blasted into the pool area from the bars and again from the activity taking place e.g. aerobics/ bingo/ Mr Yucatan etc. Also in the restaurants you have their speciality music and the bar music competing loudly. *Entertainment - it was mostly v holiday campish - not good quality apart from the Mexican singers and band. You could not escape it either if anywhere near the pool. *Decoration - felt like a fake Mexican restaurant in UK or Disneyland Mexican stylee - tacky. Good points *Food - varied each night and was to an extremely good standard although buffet restaurant was noisy and a bit like a canteen as tables were packed in. *Proximity to beach - although it was v crowded as Tequlia guests also use it. *Clean rooms - beautifully tidy each day with fridge regularily stocked. Overall this hotel is bottom of the rung Riu wise and does not possess the class of a European 4*. Some people spent all day at the bar and were loud and noisy and children were quite happy to dive bomb anyone in the pool (which by the way badly needed a clean and repaint as did the older pool bar). Service was reasonable. We moved to the Riu Palace Mexico after a week for just a couple of hundred pounds extra and it was 100 times better. Quiet or lively during the day depending on where you sat round the pool, clean pool and well maintained grounds and facilities. Not overcrowded, loads of loungers even at 12pm, shade near the beach, hammocks and puts the Yucatan to shame.

It seemed like it was always the same basic dishes with a few variations here and there. The steakhouse was good, but bring your bug spray... the mosquitos are BRUTAL. Asian was OK, but I don't think we'd go there more than once. Never made it to the Mediterranean. Bartenders were - for the most part - very attentive ( I was one of those \"ignored\" by Santos while the Cleveland folks enjoyed his attention). Evening bartenders during the shows were awesome - those guys really busted their a**es each and every night. Pools were OK, but for most of our visit the water was way too warm. Besides that, half the time it was really cloudy and on more than one occasion we encountered disgusting floaties. Went into PDC a couple times ($5 each way) for some shopping (found some GREAT deals on premium tequila) and did dinner once at La Adela, which was pretty good (we got tired of the dinner buffet). The infamous lounge reserving around the pool was in full force, as was the homemade shade on the beach. RY would get all 5's in my review if they did something with umbrellas/palapas/whatever on the beach - that July sun is strong. Would we go again? If we went with the kiddos, absolutely.

We booked it from their website and got a $99/night/person price, which wasn't bad at all, all things considered. Food: Breakfast was more than enough. The donuts were very yummy. :-) The fresh juice stand was really good as well. Lunch was fine; couldn't eat much cause it was so hot! We only visited La Hacienda once for lunch and it was a nice change from the beach-side lunch location. Dinner was also good at the buffet. We visited all 3 restaurants and did not like the Mediterrean restaurant. I got the seafood casserole. The waiter didn't understand English enough to explain what was in it, so I took my chances. Yuck. The desserts served in all 3 restaurants were the best desserts on the resort. The desserts on the buffet were all dry and cakey, except for the night they did choc. covered strawberries and ice cream. They have a huge variety of food for all nationalities; Europeans, Brits, Americans, etc. Pizza and french fries are there for the little ones!! (and the not-so-little ones :-) The Asian restaurant and Steakhouse were good; a great change from the buffet. You have to make your reservations early'ish in the morning or they book up. Drinks: Hey, they were great! :-) I tried a Mojito for the first time and got hooked. The bartenders worked very hard alllll day but were always friendly. You can ask for better liquor, like Smirnoff or Bacardi and you'll get it. Once so ordered, the bartender on duty usually remembers your request for the evening. Room: Yes, the beds were HARD. Various body parts fell asleep during the night due to the pressure points, but we were so tired, it didn't stop us from sleeping. Yeah, the beds are a weird size. Too small to fit 2 adults in one bed, but then you can't snuggle with your honey. :) The \"door\" to the bathroom was weird if you have a family there; it's only a curtain. The liquor in the room was pretty foul and we hate Pepsi products, so we hardly drank anything in the room. (Note, You can get Coke by walking out of the resort to the stores in the Playacar area!!!) We stayed in building 5, which was near the pool and bar, but honestly it was rather quiet in the room. At night you could hear the entertainment, but it was over by 11. I thought it was a great location, close to everything on the resort. Pool: A bit disappointed here. It would make more sense if the 2 pools were connected. They look like they were once but got filled in with concrete. The swim-up bar in the one pool was fine. the other swim-up bar is a pool all by itself, in that you have to get out of either pool to get to it, and the water in there was chilly. The other 2 pools were almost tooooo warm. The pools close at 8 for cleaning and chlorine and boy, does it smell like it in the evenings! Beach: Yes, my husband got up every morning around 7:30 to put towels on the loungers at the beach. You had to if you wanted some shade, which is a must for us. The beach was very nice though; we walked down the beach for a bit and thought ours was the nicest. It's the largest with the most trees. It has 2 massage huts on it; I got a massage one day (thanks to the crappy bed) and it was the best massage I've ever had. Soooo relaxing! We didn't take out any of the boats or anything, even though we kept meaning to. If you take bread down into the water, you can feed the fish. We had 3 different size fishes swimming around us when others were feeding them; very cool! There can be some waves there; it's not like the calm Caribbean we've been to before. Entertainment: We only watched bits of 2 shows. We were tired by the end of the day and the little bits we saw were a tad boring. A few nights we sat by the bar in the main lobby and just talked and drank; it was fun. :) Resort itself: Very nice and pretty. We looked at the other Riu hotels we had access to and ours was the nicest. Laid out nicely with lots of animals to watch, including the resort cats. This is a group of \"wild\" kitty cats who like to loiter on the main walkway to the restaurants in the hopes that you'll bring them food. They're very friendly. The little grey kitten purrs all the time and will let you pick him up. His mother is walking around too; she's pregnant again. Overall, I just said \"awwwwww!\" Staff: Except for one bartender the first day we were there, everyone was very nice and polite. The people who work the breakfast shift in the restaurants also work lunch and dinner. IE: they work allll day. it made me feel like a jerk by the time we came home. I know different cultures are different, but good grief...No wonder they think we all are rich. We did get some fun towel art in the rooms.Tips are very appreciated, but the lobby staff almost got mad at us because we didn't want to use the bell boy. There aren't any elevators but we only had 2 bags and were on the 2nd floor. Weather: 350 days of sunshine my foot!!! We spent at least 3 days dodging raindrops, running for a bar, and then walking back 15 minutes later when the sun came back out. On Friday it rained. And rained. And rained, allllll day. We sat in the lobby on the sofas and read. Bring some cards with you in case this happens! Acitivites: We went to Xel-ha and booked it through the NW airlines rep in the hotel. Well, that's what the sign said anyway. We shopped around at the different desks and theirs was the cheapest AND the same price I found online, $87 for everything. Get the all inclusive - any means in Xel-ha cost around $22 a person. It was a great day, beautiful place, definitely worth it.

The sports around the pool were perfect for me and my kids (15, 19), such as some serious Beach Volleyball and very serious water polo games and ping pong tournaments. I didn't like the swim up the bar as the tables had ashtrays and smokers made it unappealing to be in the water right next to the tabels and ashtrays. But we stayed in the other parts of the pool tha was clean and very enjoyable. There was no shortage of bars or drinks. Unfortunately, they charge my kids the same price as an adult who drinks all day..but thats common with all the places. We really loved the wildlife that we had read about on Tripadvisor: 12 + Monkeys in the trees, kupaberras walking around etc. that I had never seen anywhere before. Most of the guests were European so we felt like we were really on vacation, unlike some hotels that find mostly other Midwesterners from the US. The pool was big enough that I could swim laps in the morning (longer than standard US pools). Food was ok...we get better meals in the US but we have yet to find great dining at any Mexican all inclusive. Lunch was set up poolside so you could eat all day without leaving the beach. Don't pay the on-site Dive shop for snorkeling if you can find other ways to go. Although it was convenient, you got mediocre snorkeling.(but the guide was very good picking up starfish and other animals from the bottom). Spend the money to go to Xel Ha..I didn't get there but was told its the best place to see thousands of fish.", "Date": "July 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Front Royal, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cIll be back next year!\u201d", "Author": "brdyboop", "ReviewID": "UR5521796", "Content": "Everything you see and read on the internet about this place, is TRUE!

Kinda crowded, mostly because the people from the Riu Tequila (across the street) use the Yucatan beach. But all down the beach is very busy so no big deal. Food: Great Buffet. We liked the Chinese restuarant also. Steak house to us was over rated but still okay. Mexico has a different concept on what a good steak should be. Rooms: Basic, clean, quiet. We had one closet to the beach and pool. Staff: Friendly, although we spent a lot of money giving the bar staff tips. Usually about $ 10 - 15US a day. One of the bar staff actually made a sarcastic comment when we just gave him some change, we got much nicer and faster service when we forking over the $ 5 US / 50 Pesos. Anyway I guess thats what you get when your staff only makes 65 US every two weeks. But we had a very good time with a few of the bar staff. Great guys. Pool: Too warm, but it is July. Swim up bar staff is slow and not so friendly unless your tipping big. We didn't use the swim up bars that often. One thing I would like to complain about: Too many kids hanging around the swim up bars, all the bars really. Really annoying. The towel on the chair thing was really funny and we liked to move people towels around just to mess with them. Or if everything was taken and no one was showing up by 11am I pushed off their towel and moved the lounge chair and used it myself. So thats about it.

Its very clean with no rocks at all. I guess the chairhogs didn't get pool chairs, so now they've invaded the beach, using 2 chairs each to build a shade thing over their chairs. Very inconsiderate! Luckily, there were plenty of chairs. There were many topless ladies there, especially closer to the water, and a few at the pool. No one hardly notices them because there are so many.

I asked for a room that was closer to the beach, I was told they were full but she would put me on a list and to check back in the morning. I checked back at 9:00 a.m. and was told we were assigned a room in building 5, top floor, 3rd room from the end (closest to the beach and pool). I was very impressed with the front desk staff the entire week (and not just because of the room change), they were always very helpful and friendly. Building 4, 5 and 6 are, in my opinion, the best buildings to be in, they are closest to the beach and pool. The buildings sit off the beach quite a ways and the rooms/balconies do not face the beach, which is odd for a beach resort. We probably had one of the best views at the resort, but I would call it a partial oceanview. The rooms are a normal size hotel room and are nice, they all have a balcony or patio. There is a mini-fridge that is re-stocked with water and soda every other day. The rooms are very quiet, which is impressive since they have tile floors. We never heard any noise from the rooms on either side. There are 3 restaurants (Mediterranean, Japanese and Steakhouse) and the buffet. I liked all of the restaurants and the buffet, no complaints. The beach is very nice, as is the water. We never had a problem getting beach chairs any time of the day. We spent the majority of our vacation on the beach, great beach! The pool needs some repairs, it always seemed dirty (even at 7:00/8:00 a.m. there would be sand at the bottom). The pool is crowded and people do put there towels on the chairs very early (I look at the pictures of the pool on the website and cannot believe I am whining about the pool, it looks beautiful). The grounds of the Yucatan are jungle-like and we enjoyed the howling monkeys (very cool) and the large rats (don't know what they are called). I went to the workout facility every day, the universal weight equipment needs replaced, very below average, the treadmills and other equipment were nice. We walked into Playa del Carmen 3 times (40 minute walk), the area around the resort is nice and we always felt safe. This is a nice resort and I was happy with our choice to stay here. We did walk the beach area quite a bit, if I were to go back I would also check out Royal Hideaway, Riu Palace Riviera Maya and Sandos. They all looked nice from the beach. We used the Riu Palace Rivera Maya's pool on 3 different days and it was a very nice resort, probably nicer than the Yucatan except for beach area and the monkeys. I hope this info is helpful.

This was my 5th trip to the Yuctan but first overnight stay in Playa. It was my second stay at an all inclusive. Pros *Beach was said to be one of the nicest and I would have to agree. Virtually no rocks (some under the water that you cant see). Cabbies agreed that the Riu Yucatan has one of the best Playa beaches. They were replacing/adding palm trees while we were there as well. Plenty of chairs to choose from. *Liquor dispensers in the rooms! Tequila, rum, vodka, and gin. Very nice touch. *Plenty of water in the fridge. 3 big bottles each day and 4 new coronas plus sodas. *Tipping is not part of the Riu culture. I saw a few tips given to bartenders but it surely wasnt necessary to get good drinks or service. *No probs checking out kayaks or boogie boards(watch the current, it can push you south pretty fast). Service at the office where you do your paperwork was poor though. They also ask that you pay $25 for a lesson to learn how to handle the sail boats. Snorkel gear is only available for 1 hour and after that you have to pay $12. *Buffet food was pretty good. No complaints. Didnt have too many sliced meat choices. *Evening entertainment at the Riu Yucatan was great. The announcers talk pretty quick though and it makes it a little hard to understand at times. *A world of activities for adults and kids to do each day. See activity board picture. Cons *Biggest by far is the set up of the complex. All buildings run perpedicular with the ocean and thus have views facing each other with foliage in between. Dissapointed that there was no chance of changing rooms and getting a better view. Not that we were in our rooms that much, but its nice to have something to look at it when your girl/wife is taking an hour to get ready. Oh and the same goes for pool view. Only a few with partial pool views. Oh and instead of having a king bed, we had two doubles pushed together and they would always slide apart. The bigger pain was how hard the beds were. This is my 5th trip to Mexico and I have slept in some hard beds there and didnt think they would bother me but these beds took stiffness to a new level. Wow, my legs would ache all day because of how stiff they are. *Pool towel game is crazy. All pool chairs gone by 730am. So many people dont even show up till well after noon to use the chairs they claimed early in the morning. Hope they didnt mind when I pushed their towels aside and used their loungers for a few hours. One would also have to wonder how many folks are coming over from the Riu Tequila to use the Yucatan pool and to also be close to the beach. *The front desk staff wasnt that impressive. We checked in close to midnight due to a flight delay (Go American airlines, you have delayed me both of my trips this year) and the front desk guy gave us the most peculiar look like it was our fault. He then told us we had a \"GREAT\" room (#5321). The room was no different than any other besides the fact that it was on the top floor. When we checked out we didnt even get a \"thank you\" or even a \"have a safe trip home.\" *Breakfast buffet only open till 1030am and then its 1pm before the next buffet. I was accustomed to always having a buffet going. Not at the Riu Yucatan. They have a continental buffet after the main buffet closes in the morning. *Specialty restaurants were just the outdoor cafes converted at night. Nothing impressive (mosquitos were rough). Mediterranean had better food than the Chinese food that was actually served buffet style. We did not eat at the Steak restaurant. *Maid starts cleaning early and are very loud. They do a great job though. Just dont plan on sleeping past 8am if you have a neighbor who is getting his room cleaned early each day. *AC in our room wasnt the best. Never seemed to get that cold. Im sure it was just our room though. I know ACs vary from room to room. Be sure to keep your balcony door closed or your AC unit wont come on. Misc *No issues with theft. Tipped the maid twice. We only had her clean our room every other day of our 7 day stay. *Kids club looked rather weak and not used. *Pool is nice. 2 sections. They are not connected though. One pool bar closes rather early at 5pm. The other was open later. *La Espuela sports bar is playing world cup games. It is not listed on the hotel map though. Its located above the lobby. Just look for the stairs. *No security seen anywhere besides the very front entrance. You could easily bring friends/guests onto the property via the beach. Could also trek next door to the Riu Palace Mexico and use their nice hammocks. *Bring a small surge protector for the room. The one convenient outlet is always just that....one. *Bugspray. Not optional. *Its a healthy 35-40 minute walk into the edge of 5th ave (downtown Playa) from the Yucatan. *Pool drinks are served in 8oz hard plastic cups. *We did eat at the buffet at the Riu Tequila (a short walk away from the Yucatan) and were impressed with the staff and the food there. *The nightclub at the Tequila had a good vibe although the two nights we visited it left much to be desired with their music selection (techno and 70s) *Getting and using your Playa Del Carmen map from the Can Do Maps website is essential.

We had a few drinks at the only bar open around the pool and then we had dinner. I thought one bar at a Mexican resort was a little strange but I really didn't give it much thought that night. The resort was nice, but from first look it was on the small side. The beachfront was nice and we saw the Monkeys that sometimes visit the resort. WE had an early nice from getting up so early and traveling all day, plus we had a full day planned the next day. We got up at 7:30am and tried to wake up from a very rough nights sleep. Someone needs to tell the Mexican Resorts that \"Pillow Top\" mattresses have been invented! Anyway, we began to get ready to go down to have breakfast and then to the beach for a day of fun in the sun and our toilet was plugged and we figured out that our shower was more than likely plugged for the same reason. After three calls the front desk and having our urgency in the matter ignored, we went the lobby to use the Restroom and tell them our situation again. The girl at the front desk said she didn't think we needed the toilet fixed so she didn't call the janitor. \"Nice\"!. Well they fixed it and we had no more problems in that department. We went to the breakfast bar and it was nothing special. Most of the food was cols and not really all that terrific. All the meals were like that.

I don't know about you, but I don't eat steak at 9:45pm in the evening.

It would have been better if the cleaning crew would not have opened all the doors in the room and let all the mosquitoes in. We spent an hour every night trying to kill them all ands woke up bitten the next morning only to do it all again the next day Visits to the cities were nice, and we did go to a really fun place called the Big Lobster in Playa Del Carmen, the people were very nice and the food was wonderful.

After reading some of the 'reports' left on this site i was a little apprehensive upon arrival. Aplogies but this might be a long review! We had prepared ourselves the best we could based on peoples hints and tips. Well, i dont know what hotel the people who gave this hotel 2/3 stars visited but the Yucatan at which we had the pleasure of residing was fantastic! Staff: The staff simply couldnt do enough for you. All staff members from gardeners to cleaners to chefs greeted you with a smile and 'buenos dias'. Goodness knows how many times a day they must have said that but they never ceased in their politeness and respect for holidaymakers. The animation team truly looked like they loved their job which ultimately had a positive effect on all the activities they organised. Grounds: The grounds were extremely well maintained. From 6am the gardeners began tending to the vast landscaped gardens which has a destinct 'jungle' feel. The wildlife is spectacular. The Agoutis (large rabbit/rat creatures) were adorable and loved a grape or two! Iguanas basked in the sunshine and the Howling Monkeys played in the trees around the grounds. Combined with the tuneful birds with their comical calls, it made you feel as if you were in a jungle! Litter on the grounds was non existant. The beach was lined with Palm Trees which provided shade. (The day we left they were planting more palm trees which were to replace those damaged/lost in the hurricane) Beach: What can i say..when i first saw the beach i could only think of paradise. White powder sand, clear turquoise sea, palm trees and a gentle breeze. Perfect. Empty cups are collected, albeit very comically, from a beach attendent who perhaps holds the world record for the tallest tower of stacked cups. (Seriously, it was about 4 meters high!) There are a few passing traders who will try and sell you cigars or silver but they never press you, you simply just dont react to them. I recommend taking full advantage of the complimentary water sports, Kayaking and Pedallos as well as snorkels and boogie boards. Great excercise and alot of fun! Pool: The pool was cleaned nightly and the poolside area was always clean. I dont know if it was my own personal preferance for a quieter holiday but i found the pool area too noisy and cluttered with sun loungers for my liking. Combined with the noise of the entertainment and kids/adults in the pool i personally preferred the beach for a far more relaxing, peaceful atmosphere. The pool water was also WARM as in getting into a bath WARM. If you want to be refreshed in the heat of the day, the pool is NOT the place to take a dip. The sea is cooler and far more refreshing. Great swim up bars though and if you can be bothered getting up at 5am to reserve your seat, the large shelters provide tonnes of shade. Rooms: Cleaned daily extremely thoroughly. After a day at the beach youre often met with a cute towel 'origami' creation left by the maid (My favourite was an elephant) though i cant imagine how many towels they must have gone through! The minibar is restocked every 2 days but should you require and more drinks before then, they wont hesitate to drop some by. Rooms are airconditioned but also have a fan for an extra breeze if required. Satellite TV showing many english channels in all rooms. Bathrooms have a main curtain rather than a door although the toilet has a locking door. Food: Food was varied and on the whole very tasty. I remember reading alot of peoples comments on how the food was very boring/lack of choice. Well i must dissagree, although i guess if you stacked your plates high with all 150 different foods on day one as some people did, you could get rather bored of it after 2 weeks. The amount of choice was actually a little daunting and i found myself walking round for a while just trying to take it all in! Seriously, i dont know where some people put it! The soup variety changed every day and were very tasty. Best advice is to keep to one style of food each night rather than piling everything on your plate. I strongly reccomend the steak house for a change of scenery and a really tasty steak though remember mozzie spray! Entertainment: The evening entertainment was on the whole very well thought out and ..er..entertaining!! The Myan and Carribean Shows are not to be missed! Great for kids too as its very lively and colourful. The awarding of the riu yucatan 'bumbags' to winners of the days activities is a little cheesy but hey, everyone who won got up on the stage so they were all up for it! Ok now to the 'truths' part of the review. CUP SIZES: I'd heard many a report about the 'miniscule size of the cups' so i already made provisions and bought a thermos mug. When i got to the hotel i almost laughed. The cups were perfectly addequate in size. What is so bad about getting up once in a while and taking a short stroll to the nearest drinks dispenser?? SHADE: Ok so a downside was the completely unecessary 'reserving' of sun loungers around the pool from around 6am onwards, many which lay without any people on them most of the day. I felt the hotel should have a stricter policy in stopping people doing this as its unfair to those guests who wanted shade round the pool but were unable to get up at a rediculous hour. HOWEVER i found that on the beach, contrary to previous reviews, there was plenty of shady spots under palm trees (even more since this review as the day i left, they were adding more palm trees to the beach) and plenty of sunloungers for everyone. Alternatively, bring your own sunshade or make a 'sunbed shade' by turning one on its head and resting it over your lounger. SERVICE: The staff were always at your becking call. They called a couple of times during our stay just to check if we were satisfied with the holiday. Our television was broken on our arrival but it was replaced within 10 minutes. Any maintenance issues were dealt with promptly. BEDS: The beds are firm. Perhaps more than most are used to at home but i never found it disrupted my sleep or was uncomfortable. I believe the hotel makes provisions if padding is required but i personally found it to be ok. TOPLESS PEOPLE: Yes there are people who go topless on this resort. After a while you just dont notice. DOWNSIDES: A little dissappointed with the Asian Restaurant - Food was not very hot and there wasnt much atmosphere though staff were great and the room had lovely oriental decoration. Plates on the main buffets are not hot so food tended to go cold quicker. I personally like to dress smart at night for my meal however some people just didnt care. Smart Casual was not always observed and some people simply just threw a pair of tiny shorts and a scruffy tshirt over a bikini. I saw someone get turned away from the restaurant for attempting to eat their evening meal soaking wet in a bikini. I just think that kind of behaviour is an insult to the hard work of the staff who try to create a nice atnmosphere in the evenings. In all this was an exceptional resort which along with some fantastic excursions (Sealife Plus - Swimming with Dolphins, Manitees and Sealions, and Chichen Iza by Air) created a truly memorable holiday.

The mattress was hard as a rock...we tossed and turned all night long and woke up with shoulder pain, back pain, etc. The worst thing was that there were ants everywhere. Ants were on the bathroom counter, on the bedside tables, on the balcony floor, walls & chairs, on the counter of the main bar in the lobby, on the bottom of the bar, all over the floor of the lobby and in the cereal on the breakfast buffet!!! The mini bar/fridge door would not close so nothing stayed cold. We reported this as soon as we got into our room and were told someone would be right over but nobody ever showed up. We stopped by the front desk the 2nd morning and reported it again as well as the ant's and for the ant's we were given a spray can of ant killer and finally someone did show up to look at the fridge. He messed around with the door for a few minutes and then said he would have to get his tools and come back....we never saw him again and we decided to try to enjoy our vacation instead of constantly having to follow up with the front desk to get things done, so we drank luke warm drinks. We did not realize there would be so many people in this area. We were never able to get a chair at the pool because by the time we got there at 8:00am, all the chairs already had towels on them. And it was just as difficult to get a spot on the beach that had some shade because of all the people. We would have liked to have been able to sleep in some mornings to enjoy our vacation but we knew if we didn't get up and go get a chair somewhere, then we would be sitting out in the direct sunlight all day long. And, the last thing is when we were checking out we forgot something in the room so while I stayed at the front desk, my friend went back to our room and when she walked in, there were a large number of people (some housecleaning and we don't know about the others) lying on the beds, going through the drawers, wearing a hat that I had left in the room and who knows whatelse. This just made us uneasy as to what might have been going on each day when they cleaned our room!! Although we had the above problems and would not go back to this hotel, the staff were extremely friendly and the beach itself was absolutely beautiful...white sand and turquoise water.", "Date": "June 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lubbock, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Go\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5397826", "Content": "My wife and I (ages 44 and 46) stayed at the RIU Yucatan form June 19 to June 24, 2006. I relied on the Trip Advisor reviews before I made my reservation. We arrived at the Yucatan on Monday evening and were met with a smile and a drink. Within 15 minutes we had been checked in, received our room key, received our safe key, received our towel cards (to check out towels for the beach and the pool), and been briefed on the facilities. A porter led us to our room. The Room We were in room 4316 (Building 4, 3rd floor, Room 16). This was the building and floor that I requested. From the front of the building we had a partial view of the pool and the Sea. From the balcony we had a view of the pool at the RIU Palace and also the Sea. The rooms, like everything else, had a tile floor. The king-size bed was hard, as other reviewers had noted. I slept fine. We left a note for the maid in Spanish asking for a blanket to put on the bed for padding. It was delivered later in the afternoon. We left a $3.00 tip for the maid every day. The refrigerator was restocked every other day. The person who restocks the refrigerator is not the maid. I left a note and a $2.00 tip in the refrigerator asking for more Pepsi and water. I received what I asked for. All fixtures in the room were very nice and worked well. We did not ever smell the musky smell that many had mentioned. I have a good nose and only smelled an odor in the room once. The only complaints about the room were the hard bed and the fact that the shower drained slowly. The Pool We sat around the pool on three different occasions. The chairs are reserved early. I got up at 6:00 AM on two mornings and about half of the chairs were already reserved. We were always able to find a chair in the shade either at the beach or at the pool. The pools were great. The water was warm, but once you got out the breeze cooled you off very well. The towel checkout worked great. The Towel Hut was near the pool. You handed them your card and they gave you a beach towel. When you got through you took the towel back and got back another towel card. At check in they told us that if you lost your towel card you had to pay $20. There was usually something going on at the pool. There were games and music most of the time. In addition to the swim-up bar in each of the two pools, there was a soda fountain nearby. They also had nachos available all day by the pool. A Scuba diving demonstration was provided free. I took the demonstration lesson one day and really enjoyed it. The Beach The beach was much quieter and more relaxing than the pool. We enjoyed watching the para sailing ($70 for two), kayaking, Jet Ski\u2019s, and sailing. There is no charge to use the non-motorized equipment. The beach and water is beautiful. I walked the beach on the entire Playacar area and like the Yucatan beach the best. The Food We always found something we liked. The food was similar every day. The lunch buffet at the \u201cMargarita\u201d by the pool was identical every day. One night we ate at the specialty Asian restaurant. It was very good. The salads and the desserts at the main buffet, the \u201cLa Hacienda\u201d was not to our liking. Overall We had a great vacation although it was very hot. We were extremely pleased with the Yucatan. I walked through several other resorts while we were in Playa and I am still happy that I relied on the Trip Advisor reviews and chose the RIU Yucatan.", "Date": "June 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, ON", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Riu Yucatan\u201d", "Author": "Laura73Toronto", "ReviewID": "UR5379873", "Content": "My husband and I just came back from a week holiday (june 17th-24th).

I was quite impressed as I expected to have a room aprox. at three o'clock in the afternoon. (plus,plus,plus). My husband and I ate at the Steak house about three times out of the seven and absolutly loved it!!! (we didn't try the japenese or mediterean). The other day's we ate at the buffet and it was great. Our room was immaculate. I brought an airfreshener with me as I thought I would be well prepared in advance in regards to the past reviews about the 'mildew smell' in the room's. Thankfully, we didn't need it! We were so impressed! However, we did find the bed's hard. We called the front desk and we recieved a cozy blanket under the sheet's which made a difference.

I sent the hotel an email a few day's prior to our depature indicating we would be spending our honeymoon at the resort.

We thought we would write a review as we found other peoples comments very useful before we went and even felt as though we had been before when we arrived having read so much and looked at so many photos. well' we were not disappointed at all. in fact the beach and the sea were even better than we expected. CHECK IN Check in was smooth and quick. Our bags were tagged with a room number so that the porters could deliver them for us. We had kept our swimming things to hand so we were able to go and explore and swim whilst our bags were in good hands. ROOMS Room was very clean in block 2 (not at all musty)which was a superb place to be an equal distance between the sea and the buffet restaurant/lobbY. we did think the beds a little awkward for my husband and I and our 17 yr old daughter. However this was no problem as very quickly when we explained an additional bed was delivered and set up for her. GROUNDS The grounds are beautifully maitained and the wildlife kept everyone entertained. We were lucky to see the monkeys who seemed to move from one area to another but could be heard before they could be seen. You are not supposed to feed them but we saw people giving them fruit .They came down from the trees to take it and were happy to sit on the fence and take bananas from your hand SEA AND BEACH The sea was a beautiful turquoise colour best seen first thing in the morning before the beach becomes populated . most of the time it was calm but on the odd day we saw surf and the waves were quite powerful. It seemed to change daily, however it was always very warm. There were shoals of fish swimming very close to the shore daily which was entertaing , some folks took bread to feed them with.Snorkels are available from the dive shop free as are pedaloes /boogie boards and windsailing. There were always beach beds to be had no matter what time of day you went down. We found the area in front of the Riu Palace under the palm trees and the area around the volley ball court quieter than the areas directly in front of the pool (probably because it was a little further to walk!) POOL Well, we are not pool people so may be biased. We found the pool area very crowded ,hot and stuffy with no breeze from the sea. All the beds were\" :booked:\" by 9 am (though not occupied) Why do people do this??? If you like to be amongst the action and activities, drink all day long and be crowded in like sardines then maybe this is for you. It certainly wasn't our cup of tea. It was much more civilised and comfortable on the beach. The pool water was lovely and warm but by the end of the day wasn't the cleanest place to be. We witnessed scum, and plenty of bugs floating around at times when we nipped up for a swim when the surf was up. FOOD plenty of choice not all to our taste but always plenty of options every meal time. We enjoyed the carvery on the outside terrace and the champagne and seafood night which they have every 2 weeks. You could choose from pasta,pizza/fish,steak,chicken,pork, rice,veg,salads,fuit, lots of pastries, icecream just to name a few things not to mention the mexican choices. The pancakes and banana fritters were lovely with a choice of toppings. We loved the asian restaurant so much we went twice the duck in orange sauce is lovely not to mention the fried ice cream!! The steak house is ok for a change my daughter loved the sticky ribs. TRIPS forget the reps you can do it much cheaper on your own by hiring a car or booking in the Plaza or in PDC. We took car cheaper if there are a few of you traveling. There is only one road so you can't get lost. You can go to all the attractions independantly and buy tickets on the day or on the net before you go. DRINKS Having read so much about the drinks in other reviews we didn't know what too expect. The glasses were adequate and you can always have another. They used brand names such as Gordans gin, beefeater,Johnny Walker whiskey etc but you had to ask for them which was not a problem they are freely available.Room fridge is refilled regularly and if you need extra or something different they will supply it no problem it just takes a phone call to reception or a word with the maid. PLAYA DEL CARMEN great for a walk round before or after dinner still very hot in the evening. We loved the atmosphere , the shops and the bars which look real pretty afer dusk. No larger louts here. NIGGLES We had a brill time but have to mention a few niggles not with Riu but the people that go there. Why is it that folks can manage to take drinks plates,bottles of water down to the Beach and yet can't manage to take them back up. We were appalled at the state of the beach at the end of the day. The beautiful beach at the start of the day was always littered with all sorts of rubbish left behind by lazy people.at the end of the day The poor overworked Riu staff have to go around collecting the rubbish every night to make it fit to return to in the morning. Can't understand this kind of abuse. Also Why do Smokers treat the beach as one huge ash tray. Such a beautiful place shou;d be respected and preserved. too many cigarette ends on the beach . we saw thre staff cleaning till late at night with tractors and then sweeping up the sea weed in the morning to keep it clean for us visitors ,come on folks show a little respect.

The hotel had been newly refurbished for the beginning of the season and was fantastic. There were lots to do in the day if you wanted, or if not plenty of places to just chill. The night time entertainment was good with a bit of something for everybody. The food was great in the main dining room the only criticism was there was too much choice. There is in addition to the main restaurant three themed restaurants, a Chinese self service that was nice for a change. A sea food one that we didn\u2019t try, and my favourite the steak house down by the beach, this was waiter service and made for a relaxing evening with the sound of the sea lapping at the shore as you dined. The staff were all very friendly from the gardeners up to the manager. Look out for Roger the barman he was in the bar in the entrance when we were there. He is quite a character and will probably become your best mate, if like us you like to drink later than midnight. The other bars close at about 12 so the late drinkers (mostly Europeans) congregate there. We met lots of people of all nationalities there and made loads of friends while ensconced there with a cool drink into the night. Playa del Carmen the nearest town is about a 5 km or 30 min walk away its ok for a morning when you want a change of scenery there is the usual touristy places there\u2019s a few nicer shops as well, it\u2019s worth a walk to see a bit of real life. Also the ferry to Cozamel departs from here. We talked to people that had been across and they told us it was worth the trip so might do that next time. On your walk back you can call at the Tequila or the Playacar for a drink trust me if you are walking back in the middle of the day you\u2019ll need a stop! We did three trips while we were there; the first was to Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 it\u2019s a must, even if it\u2019s just to say you have been. Climbing to the top of the pyramid was worth it for the view alone! The second trip was the trip to swim with the dolphins, the trip we did you also got to swim with stingrays and Manatees. Manatees are so funny, strange and shy, feeding them was fun though. The last trip we did and also my favourite was the jungle crossing tour by alltournative travels 4X4 Unimog. They pick you up at the hotel in it and whisk you off to the jungle down road only a mog or a tank could get down! You then get to swim in an underground cave, then after a short walk through the bush you get to swim in an amazing underground river. After a short ride you then get a typical Mayan lunch after a short rest its back to the mog for a short ride to the sea where you get to kayak out to a coral reef and snorkel with the fish. The day we did it there were waterspouts in the sea and it was thundering and lightning, Oh fun! One last thing get up one morning for the sunrise it\u2019s worth it!

We arrived at 12:30pm and the room was not ready. Since we had been bumped from Cancun, we were offered a Suite at the RIU Yucatan. Jose assisted us (wonderful person). He informed us that our room was not ready, which was fine, he offered a room for us to change into our bathing suits and have our luggage moved to our room. He was very sweet and moved our room to building 6 so we could be close to the beach and pool area. We were on the ground floor next to the Stage. Honestly, the music and entertainment did not bother us at all. We went to the bar at the pool area and had a few drinks. When we left for our room, boy were we surprised! It was fabulous. We were at the end and unlocked the door which opened into a foyer. Then to the left, was a door which opened into the bedroom. 2 Queen beds pushed together, a table, huge closet, dresser with mirror, chair, TV, sliding glass doors to the patio. There was an open area that was covered by drapes, and there was a sitting room with a couch, TV, table 2 chairs, closet, open bar with refrigerator, and 2 sliding glass doors to the patio, which had 2 nice padded chairs and table. The bathroom was very nice. 2 sinks on a marble counter top, shower with bath and toilet with a separate door. We were very pleased. The resort is in a setting of a \"jungle\" theme. It was very neat with the wild life. They have Howler monkees, a type of racoon, and another type of large animal in the \"rodent\" family. Food \u2013 the breakfast was very nice, buffet style. Good selection. Lunch by the pool was so-so. The LaHacienda which is also for breakfast, had a very nice lunch. We only ate the Asian restaurant which required reservations. It was served buffet style, but very good and tasty. Service \u2013 impeccable! The resort is extremely well kept and very clean. The staff are extremely friendly, and well informed. Please, please tip. A couple of dollars a day is definitely appreciated \u2013 it showed!!! Beach \u2013 fabulous!

We did a Bar leaping tour which included 3 bars and all you can drink and transportation for $55.00. The last club, Mambo Caf\u00e9 was the best!!! Senor frogs was so-so, as was Carlos-n-Charlies.

We were part of a group of 37 that went to witness a friend\u2019s daughter get married on the beach and have a nice break in the sun. Most of the group was 25-ish, but there were 10 of us \u2018oldtimers\u2019; three couples who stayed at the Yucatan. Others were at the Riu Palace next door, and most of the younger crowd at the Riu Tequila. Though we are not seasoned \u2018hot-spotters\u2019, I felt obligated to provide some comments, as I visited this site frequently when planning our trip, and found the information invaluable. Here\u2019s a summary: Riu Complex \u2013 the five hotels in the area really worked well for us, as the younger set stayed at the Tequila to save some $$, while the B & G and parents splurged a little on the Palace. The wedding was on the beach on the north end of the Yucatan property, the wedding supper at the Tequila\u2019s Steak restaurant, we frequented the disco at the Tequila, nightly shows at the Tequila and Yucatan, and we all got together often to enjoy the great beach and swim-up bar at the Yucatan. Though all properties and amenities are similar, it was nice to be able to move between properties a bit (though access to the Palace is not granted to those staying at the Yucatan, Tequila or Playacar). Rooms \u2013 even though we booked 4 months ahead, we were told the Yucatan was sold out (Easter break), and we had to upgrade to suites\u2026 a waste of money (if there\u2019s just two of you in the room). The big bathroom (with a door) was a plus, though. We 3 couples all were in Building 6 \u2013 right beside the theatre where the nightly shows were held. Previous reviews warned of this, and the late-night noise, but it really wasn\u2019t that bad, as we were up late taking everything in anyway. A big bonus of the Yucatan resort is its proximity to the beach, and Buildings 4, 5 & 6 are the closest on the property, so is a real treat to be able to get to and from your room in a flash. Yes, our room had a (very) musty smell. Again, (because of my visits to this site) I was expecting this, and we just put up with it. We, like others on this site have said, would\u2019ve appreciated in-room coffee and an iron/ironing board. The fridge was stocked every second day (not daily), and we were short of water and cola a number of times. Beds \u2013 they\u2019re real hard, but was super for my bad back\u2026never slept better \u2013 go figure! I (also) don\u2019t understand why the beds are pushed together (a king-size makes more sense to me, but some people probably push the two apart). My wife was really looking forward to the maids\u2019 \u2018towel art\u2019 that other reviewers had mentioned, but was disappointed that our maid (a male, by the way) did not do them. On our second last day I pleaded (assisted by a 50 peso tip) to a nearby maid to do one as a surprise for my wife and did she deliver! We had an alligator, a swan, a cake, balloons, flowers\u2026. the whole nine yards \u2013 nice! Grounds \u2013 kept very nice and well-manicured. Damage from Katrina is not very noticeable, except for the missing leaves, especially on the palms closest to the ocean. Building 6 is smaller (and less noisy, I assume) than the rest, as it allows for a larger green space between it and Building 3 to its west. This is a real nice area, and frequented by the animals on the property. Watching the iguanas and monkeys (with their babies) was enjoyed by all at the resort, but you have to beware of their droppings, which always adorned the walkway (even though staff tried their best to keep it washed clean). The aroma was a bother at first, but no big deal. Liquor \u2013 this was our first \u2018all-inclusive\u2019 stay, and we really enjoyed the convenience. We used the water in the rooms but not the booze, as we are rye whiskey drinkers, and that was not a choice in the dispensers. We stopped trying to get diet cola brought to our room after a few wasted phone calls (a bar was right outside our room, anyway, and they had it there!). I had no problems getting Canadian whiskey at the bars, and the bartenders would happily mix the drinks as strong as I asked for. We found the fruit drinks a little sweet and low-alcohol, but maybe just as well. Abraham at the south swim-up bar really gained our favor, as he was always in good spirits and entertaining. We took some plastic thermal mugs down with us (left them for the maid the last day), and they really helped keep the drinks cool when on the beach. We think the pool bars close down too early. Tipping, Money, etc. \u2013 lots tipped, lots didn\u2019t. We tipped the bartenders often, but not always, and left two dollars each morning for the maid. We took American dollar bills with us for this purpose. We took Mexican pesos for shopping and charged the tours and outside excursions. We (as many others write about) found the safe in the room low and awkward to get at. Pools & Beach \u2013 the pools at other Resorts looked the about the same (some were bigger), but the Yucatan didn\u2019t have as many palapas for shade from the hot April sun as others (they should really add more). The pool was busy and packed the whole time we were there. As we normally didn\u2019t get going that early in the morning, we usually set up on the beach. The towel (to reserve chairs) stories are true, and is a real \u2018game\u2019. My wife and were first at the pool at 5:12 one morning to get the best spot \u2013 right on the east edge of the pool, under a palapa, right by the wall, and just down from the swim-up bar (the next person showed up at 5:25, and all the good spots were gone by 6!). There was usually a nice breeze and from here you could face the pool or turn your chair around to look at the ocean. You couldn\u2019t leave your spot, though, as Riu staff cleaned out everything at 6:45 a.m. if no one was sitting there. The Yucatan\u2019s beach looked (to us) like the nicest along the Playacar \u2018strip\u2019, and I think is the main reason people go and return there. It is large, sloped down to the gorgeous waters of the Caribbean ocean, has beautiful, fine sand, no sandbags and no weeds. We tried to get back from the ocean-front as far as possible, as the palms there weren\u2019t as damaged, and they offered some shade. There were usually extra chairs available that we rigged up hanging over the ones we were using, to give some protection from the sun. There were a few women topless, and quite a few older, overweight European men had skimpy speedos on, but neither seemed to offend anyone too much. A nice diversion was watching all the activity on the water, but the wind was strong for 4 of the days we were there, and the beach was \u2018red-flagged\u2019\u2026.no watercraft allowed out. The waves get pretty strong (one of our group lost his prescription glasses, another his snorkel gear!), and we found the little swimming goggles we brought came in handy to keep the saltwater out of your eyes. Riu Yucatan Activities and Entertainment \u2013 we were really quite impressed (remember\u2026\u2018first-timers!) with the schedule and range of things to do during the day at the Resort. Our wives participated in the aquasizes daily (we think they were taken by the male instructors), I was a \u2018winner\u2019 at horseshoes one day, and one of our group (Tsunami Keith!) won a belly-flop competition. If we weren\u2019t as busy, we would have done more\u2026. Spanish lessons, volleyball, scuba & dancing lessons, etc. The Riu\u2019s Animacion Team were really good, and I can\u2019t believe how hard and long they worked, always with a smile and upbeat humour. All of the front-line staff spoke good English (and some other European languages, too). We watched most of the nightly shows (a couple at the Tequila), and though not of Vegas caliber, we were entertained, and a nice way to relax after our hectic days. Three of us men went sailing (no charge for the boat) one day. I would have liked a waveboard on occasion, but there was never any available when I wanted one. We signed up for parasailing, but left it too late as the last 3 days were too windy for the boats. Off-Site Tours \u2013 we were busy for our 7 days there\u2026 actually squeezed too much in, and didn\u2019t have enough \u2018beach time\u2019. We took the \u2018Scuba Caribe\u2019 snorkel excursion to a reef south of Xcaret. The water was rough (some got sick), and it took 40 minutes to get there, leaving only 45 minutes to snorkel. The reef was nice with lots of fish, but a little churned up with the wind, and not as clear as usual, I suspect. We also did the Tulum/Xel-ha combination one day, and were very impressed. Tulum (go in the morning\u2026 it would\u2019ve been too hot in the p.m.) was great and way more profound and expansive than I expected. Our guide was very passionate and he made the tour that much better. Lots of good photo-ops there; from the cliffs overlooking the ocean. Xel-ha was excellent, too, but busy so the water was a little murky. We should\u2019ve allocated more time there, as would like to have swam with the dolphins, seen/done everything, and had a chance to relax\u2026 definitely an \u2018all-day\u2019 stop next time. We took our own snorkel gear down with us, and though big and bulky, was a good idea. Nice having better caliber equipment, and stuff that hasn\u2019t been shared by hundreds of others. We used them in the ocean at our beach, too. Golf - I went golfing with one of our crew to the Jack Nicklaus Par 3 Riviera Maya at the Mayan Resorts (half way back to Cancun): $75US (supposedly $150US/round, but 1/2 off through a Riu connection) + $25US for clubs, so a pretty expensive outing for a short course. Was in good shape, interesting layout and not too busy, so fun. The Playacar course just west of the Playacar hotels looks real nice, but around $180US/round, so a little out of our league. Playa del Carmen \u2013 went into town ($5US cab fare) one afternoon. A pretty interesting (but repetitive) collection of bars and silver, T-shirt & trinket shops. Was fun haggling over prices, but we had no real idea of the stuff\u2019s actual worth, so probably still paid too much! Didn\u2019t do the club thing, but the younger set that was with us did, and had a blast. Food \u2013 much is written on these pages of the food at the resort, but we were pleased overall with the quality and selection (though we haven\u2019t a lot to compare to). We typically had a big breakfast at La Hacienda (buffet), and the variety was excellent for us westerners. We appreciated that the (hot) food was prepared right there. The coffee was instant, and though easy for the hotel, sure doesn\u2019t taste like brewed. We usually grabbed a burger/pizza & salad for lunch at the pool-side Margarita (which turns into the Steakhouse for dinner). The food there was okay and quick, but you had to beware of the birds flying through! We tried the Steakhouse both at the Yucatan & Tequila (the wedding reception was held there) \u2013 both were identical menus! Selection there was limited, service slow (even though only half full) and salad was a single Romaine leaf each! We liked the Shanghai (oriental) better, though the buffet-style was not \u20185-star\u2019 to some. The meal wine everywhere was \u2018on tap\u2019, and, again easier for the hotel, but bottled would have tasted much better and presented like a class place. Table service at the main buffet was weak, but not a big deal to us. We didn\u2019t try the Mediterranean (no seafood lovers). Dress for dinner was good, and we didn\u2019t notice many in shorts or swimwear. Clietele \u2013 lots of Americans, Canadians and Europeans. There were some families there with younger children, but we thought they were pretty well behaved (though we weren\u2019t in the pool and pool area much). There were lots of younger adults there, and quite a few groups like us\u2026 adults vacationing together. We met lots of real nice people (and some who seem to complain too much), but there were always those who butted in at the bars and lineups. Wedding \u2013 arranged through the Palace, but the service was on the Yucatan beach at the far north end. We were all surprised and very impressed with the gentleman who performed the service \u2013 well-spoken, very passionate and convincing about the importance of marriage and the vows. A beautiful, sunny day, the Caribbean ocean in the background and a slight breeze\u2026pretty nice. A tip for any planning a wedding in these areas\u2026 select appropriate attire. Our bridesmaids wore short sleeveless dresses, the guys had unbuttoned (tieless), untucked shirts. The wedding party at a service held after ours had formal, long dresses and classic black tuxes and ties\u2026 they looked roasted.", "Date": "May 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Yucatan\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5229004", "Content": "Absoloutely loved the yucatan me (phil) and three other mates (Jim,Dan, Matt) from England stayed their had a brilliant time from day 1.

We all had a wonderful time and enjoyed our stay there. Check In: Check in was easy breezy. We were welcomed with a cold drink and within minutes we had the keys to our room and our luggage was being taken up. Rodrigo at the front desk was very nice and very helpful. Rooms: The rooms were a decent size and were very clean. Our room had two double beds pushed together and the mattresses are pretty firm as mentioned in previous posts. I did not have an issue with the mattresses since I was exhausted by the time I went to bed each night. We had towel art left in our room each day after they came and cleaned our room (another couple with us only got towel art the first night). The television in the room did not get that many channels but we did not care since we weren't on vacation to watch TV. The mini bar in our room was stocked every other day. There was one day when it should have been stocked and it wasn't. We just stopped by the front dest on our way to the beach asd asked them to restock it. When we went back to the room our mini-fridge had been refilled. The mini-fridge had bottles of water, soda, and beer. There is also a bar in the bathroom area that had dispensers of tequila, rum, and vodka. We did have one day where our toilet wouldn't flush. Once again we stopped at the front desk on our way to the beach and it was fixed when we came back. Overall, I think the rooms were much nicer than what I had expected. Restaurants: There is a main buffet, another buffet by the pool area, alacarte steakhouse, alacarte asian place and I think there was one more alacarte that we never made it to. The two alacarte restaurants that we went to (asian and steakhouse) were just ok. Nothing really to complain about but they were just ok. The buffets were good and even the pickiest eater could find something to eat. Although the food at the buffets seemed to be pretty much the same everyday, at night they mixed it up a little bit by adding a pasta station or a meat carving station out on the back patio. It took us a couple of days to even realize that these stations were set up out there so take a peek so you don't miss out on it. We were there for a week and by the end of the week we were sick of the food at the buffet and should have ventured out to one of the other Riu properties, but we were too tired to do it. All in all, no one in our party was able to find something to eat at every meal and no one got sick the entire time we were there. The only downside to the restaurants is that there is nothing open after 10 or 11 at night. There were a couple of nights that I could have used a late night snack but nothing was open. In the overall scheme of things, it wasn't that big of a deal. Pool: We did not spend much time at the pool since we can do that at home. The chairs around the pool seemed to all be occupied with only a few empty ones with towels on them. I am guessing that perhaps those people were in the pool cooling off. I would say that you probably need to get down there fairly early if you want a chair by the pool or a chair by the pool that has shade. The pool bar seemed to be a happening place and always had lots of people at it. Beach: The beach was awesome! I loved the soft white sand and the warm turquiose water! We never had any problems finding a chair at the beach. I did notice that some people were taking the beach chairs and propping them up behind the beach chair that they were sitting in so that they would have some shade. At one piont I noticed a worker from the Riu walking around and asking people not to do this, probably because it was taking a chair away from someone who could use it properly. There were some topless women at the beach but it was really no big deal. Also, there were lots of activities down at the beach. My husband and some friends went out jet skiing and I think that was $55 for half an hour. Hotel Grounds: The hotel grounds were very green and lush. I had read on previous reviews about the monkeys and I went searching for them, but never found them. We did see a lot of squirrel type creatures running around and a few cats. The hotel grounds are clean and well kept. Anamation Team: Now these people really work their tails off! I saw them from the crack of dawn until the nightly show was over. They are an energetic group of people who never seem to stop smiling. What a great group of people. Nightly Shows: The nightly shows were kind of cheesy but still very entertaining. Each night there was a different theme to the shows. Scuba Caribe: The main purpose of our trip was to go scuba diving. Since it had been almost a year since I had gone on a dive I wanted a refresher class. Scuba Caribe, which is right on the property, did a great job on the refresher course. The refresher course is taught in the pool at the hotel. When we originally inquired about the refresher course they said it would cost $25 hoever, they never did charge us for it. We priced diving trips through Scuba Caribe and they were way overpriced so we did not use them for our diving trips. Apple Vacation Reps: The Apple Vacation reps that were in the lobby of the hotel were not very helpful and on a couple of occassions there was one of them was was exteremly rude and she acted like she didn't want to answer any of our questions. Apple Vacations was also way overpriced on the diving trips that we inquired about. Some of our friends purchased tickets to Xel-Ha through them and they were promised immediate entry into the park without having to wait in any lines. When they got to the park they had to wait in line for 45 minutes just to gain entry into the park. So be careful with the Apple reps because they seem to mislead people. Spa: I got a few massages on the beach while I was there. It was about $65 for an hour, which is about what you pay in the US. Although it is hot outside, the breeze that blows through the cabanas on the beach feels cool and refreshing. All of the massages were very well done and one of them was actually the best massage I have ever had! This was money well spent. Diving: Myself, my husband and another couple took the ferry over to Cozumel to go scuba diving. The ferry takes about 35 minutes to get from PDC to Cozumel. When we got over there we found a dive operator on the dock as you get off the ferry. We ended up going on a dive with just the four of us, a dive master and the captain of the boat. We did not want to do a dive trip with a huge group of people and a packed boat so this was exactly what we were looking for. We spent two days with this same diving company (Eco Divers) and they were wonderful and reasonably priced. We payed $115 USD each per day for a two tank dive. The dive master brought her underwater digital camera with her and took wll over 300 pictures of the dive trips and then burned them to a CD for us. This was all included in the price of the dive trip. The Apple Reps and Scuba Caribe both wanted well over $200 for a 2 tank dive. So as I mentioned before, be careful of purchasing excursions through the hotel. 5th Avenue: We went down to 5th Avenue a few nights while we were there. The cab ride is only $5 from the hotel. It is fun to just go walk around down there and see all of the shops, bars, and restaurants. There is a lot to see and do! Cancun: One night we took a cab up to Cancun to go to the nightclubs. The cab ride was $60 each way. We went to Monkey Love and Sliders, which are both open air outside bars. Both played good dance music and were fun places to hang out. We also went to The City and this is a must see and do kind of place if you go into Cancun. The cover charge is $40 and it is all you can drink. It is easy to get a table and the entertainment is outstanding. They have fire dancers, acrobatics, and lip syncers that come out in between songs and put on shows for the crowd. The $40 cover charge is worth the shows alone. Weather: The weather was warm and humid while we were there, but that is to be expected in the Caribbean. Every day was sunny with no rain or clouds.

Daniel and Jeverlley the bartenders were awesome! They we always friendly and served drinks quickly. They always welcomed you with smiles on their faces and remembered what you drink. I hope that the hotel acknowledges them for their superior service. There is however no waitresses so you must always go to the bar in order to get something to drink, at the pool and during a shows at night. The front desk staff was OK . Veronica was very friendly and remembered our names and took care of problems we had. Carlos was also helpful. Most of our problems came from the Apple vacation Rep there. They don't care about you. Just want to make more money on the side by getting you to sign up for trips and activities. They get a percentage of the money. Also do not give anyone cash there. They can take Visa but tell you that you cant. They have some kind of sneaky operation going on. The hotel was always clean and people working all day on the grounds and in the lobby. Maids constantly cleaning and sweeping up sand. Very nice. We had a junior sweet. It was beautiful. Always cleaned properly and the fridge was stocked daily. We had a pluming problem and they told us they couldn't fix it b/c there is not 24 maintenance. So we had to walk in water for a day. Also took 4 phone calls to get our laundry back and 4 phone calls to fix our clogged toilet. I think they could do much better at getting things taken care of the first time you call. The activity staff was always friendly and worked their butts off! It seems the same staff was there at least 13 hours a day! They always got people to participate and were very fun to be around. They were active all day and night. Very nice. It was almost impossible to get a seat on the pool or beach. One morning I got there at 7am to put a towel down to hold a spot (that's what people do there) and there were no seats!!!! The next day I go up at 5am and found a spot but there were still many people up at that hour sneaking a spot. They hold their seats there all day!!! Also many topless people around the pool. Not too bad but should be kept on the beach or in a different section. There were children present. Also many topless children. 8-10 year old without clothing on! Out of 7 days we pent 1 day at the pool. First two days couldn't get a seat! They need to offer more shade too. The sun is very hot and an burn in minutes. I didn't like that the hotel didn't have many things that could have made the trip more convenient. The hotel offered things like para sailing but you had to walk to another hotel after paying in order to participate. Also didn't have an ATM. You had to either walk the 20 minutes to town in the blazing heat and sun or get a taxi to get money. Also the spa is outside the hotel and you have to pay there. You can not charge it to your room. I found this out after walking there for my appointment and was told i needed to go all the way back to my room for my credit card. By the time i got back to my room i was so hot i didn't want to go back so they lost out on my $200.00 appt. The rooms need some things in them too. No iron or ironing board. You can however pay the hotel a large fee and they will have your clothes back in at least 48 hours. Took us about 55 hours to get t shirts cleaned. Doesn't help when you are going out for the night. No coffee maker, no room service, no place to eat 24 hours. After hours you can not get a bite to eat anywhere! The food at the hotel was horrible. Nothing made reason on why they would serve such things. Also the menu was the same daily. Bread was stale and the restaurants were almost all buffets. Don't bother eating at the Chinese restaurant. EVERYTHING was too salty. When you eat at the covered buffet by the pool you have to fight off birds and wet seats. All in all my boyfriend and I had a great time and the location and grounds and staff were wonderful. I think the problems were from corporate trying to offer \"all inclusive\" but then charging you all over for other necessary items. And I think problems came from other vacationers. ( The English find it necessary to start fights with other guests and are very loud about how they hate Americans.) Visit 5th street if you get a chance. I wish we had gone earlier in the week. The food there was awesome and the shops were cool. Didn't like people yelling at you to buy things and very pushy but if you pretend you don't speak English they leave you alone.

We researched all the resorts within 5 miles of Playa del Carmen and for the $$ and amenities it was between the Yucatan and the RIU Playacar. We decided to spend a little more on the Yucatan since it has been recently remodeled. The reviews posted on Trip Advisor, as usual, were right on. This resort has everything you could want for the money. - Random Feedback - Hotel was close to full or sold out while we were there. At check in, we saw they had assigned us a room in one of the back buildings and we asked if we could be closer to the beach/pools. They said no problem and gave us a room with a better location. Did have to ask on 3 different occasions to get a $100 bill broke into $20's, but got it done. Great gools/2 great swim up bars Pools are warm, service is good. There is also a bar right at the top of the stairs leading to the beach. It is only 30 - 50ft away! We wore a deep path from the beach to that bar over 7 days. Drinks are served in small cups, but if it is a problem, get the big mugs. They are happy to fill them. They will pour well liquor unless you ask, but they do have a fairly good selection of call and top shelf available. Pool bars close at 5pm, but the big outdoor bar right next to the pool stays open until midnight. That is where everything happens after 5pm. Take the time to get to know the bartenders, (you can tip or not..) and they will recognize and take care of you. Like anywhere, if you are fun and friendly, they will be too. It is amazing how hard they work, and still keep a good attitude. Beach is great. Plenty of chairs and lots going on. One day they set up a stand next to the stairs and served big cocunuts with drinks in them. Another day, they had a band at the bottom of the steps and served mai tias to everyone on the beach. These things seemed to be unannounced and spontaneous, which made it even more special. Only 1 towel per guest with the towel card, which can be a drag, but at the end of the day there always seemed to be abandoned towels, so we had extra cards by the 3rd day. Not a lot of shade on the beach, but there were enough chairs to make \"chair umbrellas\". The main buffet was great. There are more stations than you could possibly hope for. The food and the selections are very good and you can see they put some work into it. Does it get repetitive after 8 days? Of course. But they know it and do different specialty food stations every night to help this. There is also corona and wine on tap... help yourself! And soda guns, water, juice, etc at every meal. There is also plenty of indoor and outdoor seating which was great. Service was amazing. Empty plates never sat more than a minute before someone picked them up. Always offering coffee, wine, etc. Very friendly, and attentive to details. Pool/beach buffet is smaller, but also very good with lots of choices and beverages. In our experience, the pool area food can be a hit or miss in a lot of places, but this was well done. We ate at the China place one night. It was a buffet as well, but very good food and service. The rooms were nice. Balcony on every room with a little device to hang swimsuits, towels, etc. Fridge in every room stocked with sodas, water, mixers. Everyday, we left a note for the maid asking for mas agua and left $2, and she would fill the fridge with bottled waters, leave extra towels, etc. Beds were very hard, but we got used to it. The shower drain did back up sometimes, and the AC does turn off when you open the sliding glass door to your balcony. Overall, better rooms than other resorts for the same $$. Being near Playa del Carmen was great. We went into town on 4 occasions. The walk from the Yucatan is about 20-25 minutes. All on lighted sidewalks next to the road. One time walking was enough when its 90 and humid. A cab is $5 to go from any of the RIU properties into Playa or back. Always one available. The ferry to Cozumel was on our side of town, and was $11 each way. Diving from the resort was expensive. There were better deals to be found in Playa and in the strip mall in Playacar. Rumors that the diving in Cozumel is still bad after the hurricane are wrong! It was amazing! The health club is located near the entrance to the Yucatan, which is nice, but does not have AC or towels for guests. Not that great... Nightclub at the Riu Tequila was rocking, but it was heavy metal night when we stopped by. Sounded like they had different music on different nights. Overall, it was a great resort. Not everything was perfect, but for cost and amenities you get, remember you are in Mexico and don't sweat the little stuff! Shout Outs! We met some great people while we were there. Ed and Denise from Boston.. you guys were a blast! Lee from London, John and Kate from Boulder, Peter the Greek, Shane and Holly from Austin. Thanks for a great time!

This was my first trip to an all inclusive resort and I loved it! The Yucatan is a beautiful clean resort, right on the beach. No long walks to get anywhere you needed to go. The staff was very accomodating with any needs that we had and they also put on great nightly shows for entertainment. The food was good. Plenty of choices for everyone at the main dinning buffet. We also tried the 3 resturants, available for dinner. All were okay, nothing spectacular, but worth a try. You have food available to you, in some shape or form, all day and into the night!! I ate way to much. They have a good selection of drinks at all of the bars and the bartenders were great... May I suggest a Blue Ocean or Miami Vice!! The only negative thing I could say about this resort was our room. (2224) It was tastefully decorated and seemed very clean, but it smelled musky. I think it was in the matress. The bed was alittle hard, but I still rested well, every night. The pillows were fine and I loved the enclosed stand up shower. There were 4 other couples with us and they didn't complain of the musky smell, so ours may have been isolated. If you want a Tiki Hut by the pool, make sure you get a towel out on the chairs by no later than 6:00am or you will loose out!! No problems getting a lounge chair at the beach. The Playacar Plaza is within walking distance and has some great little shops. A bigger selection of shopping is available in Playa (5th street) which I suggest taking a Taxi!! To long of a walk, in the heat!! You'll find lots of shops, bars and resturants. Alot of the shops, you can name your price on goods! I love to barter, so that was fun. From that same area, you can catch the ferry and go over to Cozumel and do some shopping there to! $11.00 US over and $11.00 back. The ride is only 35 minutes. All in all we had a blast. This was a great experience and I would definately recomend the Riu Yucatan, however, rather than go back there, I want to try some of the other Riu Resorts in other destinations.", "Date": "May 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Overland Park, KS", "Title": "\u201cRIU \"YUCKATAN\"\u201d", "Author": "boopity", "ReviewID": "UR5028310", "Content": "Please don't waste your money at this \"resort\". I don't even know where to begin. This place cuts corners sooo bad. They do all they can to make the most money they can off the guests. I traveled with 4 other ladies for a girls trip. We are in our early 30's. We stayed for 4 miserable nghts from April 27th to May 1st. I'll start with the pros: 1. The beach and the beautiful weather to go with it! Now, the cons: 1. The cups they use for drinks are about 6 oz. cups i.e. 2 swigs and it's gone. If you go here, be sure to bring a huge insulated cup and have them fill it up to the top when you order. 2. There is no wait staff- If you want a drink, you'd better be prepared to get up and get it- every time- at the beach and the pool! 3. They don't re-stock the mini-fridge in the rooms. You can't drink the tap water and there is none in your fridge- what do you do? You go BUY it at the store in the lobby, so they can make even MORE money off of you! 4. The people that work at this resort are not friendly- they are unfriendly. Not all of them, but most. The lobby bartender would actually roll his eyes when you'd order a drink! They are not helpful, they don't clear plates from your table. It's like they hate being there. 5. The shower in the room fills up with water while you are showering. Therefore, you are standing in your own scum, ankle deep, while you shower. This was in both rooms. 6. The sink water smelled like a sewer when you'd wake up in the morning to brush your teeth. It was a lovely smell, especially after one had been drinking all day the day before! 7. The beds are bricks. 8. The air conditioing doesn't hardly work in the room. 9. The buffets get VERY repetitive for all meals. The only thing worth eating was guacamole and I'm not a picky eater. 10. When we requested the top shelf liquor in our drinks, we were blatanly ignored- repeatedly. Finally, we quit asking! 11. Gross, nasty, overweight breasts all around the beach and pool. If your not into looking at that, stay away I could go on for days! I've. stayed at The Aventura Spa Palace twice and The Royal Hideaway. Spend your money at those places. It's worth every penny! All-in-all, this place was all about cutting corners to make a buck and it was evident EVERYWHERE! We spoke with many other guests who felt the same way. All five of us were in agreement on this and our best day of the trip, was the day we left to come back home!

We were disappointed to find out that there were no adjoining rooms but opted for 2 rooms over a suite, feeling we needed 2 bathrooms for the 5 of us. Our rooms were next door, sharing a small hallway off the main walkway outside the rooms, with just one room past us. We felt very safe and as connected as could be; but still kept 1 adult in each room overnight. Maid service was great, drink requests honored for mini-fridge. Beds hard but not totally uncomfortable, pillows okay. Had couple mainenance issues, which were immediately addressed. Drying rack on deck got great sunlight in AM to finish off drying of bathing suit. Only few English-speaking channels on TV, no iron or ironing board or coffeemaker in rooms. Found packets of gel and shampoo for shower, not too sudsy but adequate. Safe in rooms a bit awkward to use and had to carry key everywhere, along with huge room key. They have towel cards, why not room cards and codes for the safes? Hated keeping track of towels; left one at pool and had to pilfer one off rack when attendant occupied to get 5 cards to turn in (threatened by unfriendly front desk person that it would cost $10 per card and $50 per safe key, if not returned. When we checked out, just tossed in a basket without accounting for either). Outside noise loud at times from other guests returning late-night. Loved pool, beach and activities. 8 yr old spend a few hours in kids club (no security, by the way..didn't want my name or room number or where I'd be so we stayed nearby and checked on him. daughter commented that they had better security for their towels!), older son played volleyball and water polo and teen daughter tried salsa lessons and \"crazy games\". Hubby and kids also played water polo in pool and in soccer game vs. the staff. Good music played poolside with fountain softdrinks, draft beer and nachos with cheese for self serve. Hard to find pool chairs after 10 am (plenty at 8 am, contrary to other posts and we were there week after Easter!), beach chairs no problem. Couple days, chairs were pulled right in front of ours just a few feet from the water, how rude! Of course, would then smoke, take tops off, etc. Resort easy to navigate for family, we stayed in building 7 near main entrance and loved being so close to food, rides, walking to town with short walk to pool/beach once a day. Our room overlooked the Riu Palace and beach access walkway for Riu Tequila, which ended up not being a nuisance as I first thought. Saw monkeys and weird squirrel-looking things on property. Food-really big negative. I dislike seafood, but otherwise we are not picky eaters. Buffets definitely had food we'd eat; but most was just a little \"funky\", for lack of a better word. Ate make-own-pasta almost every night. No salads, just mixes of odd ingredients, even hot dog pieces in one! Good fresh fruit; but mostly melon, which is not my personal favorite. Pineapple everyday, one day grapes, one day strawberries. Only had lunch one day, better than dinner as far as palatable options. Really thought we'd have a better selection of spicy, tasty Mexican fare. Had one dinner at steak house, was okay but definitely a step up from buffet. Gave us 8 long romaine leaves as part of Caesar Salad for 5 people! Appetizers mostly fried, but good. Soup great, steak a little fatty, baked potato, sauteed vegies and Basked Alaska for dessert very good. Nice to eat outside with view of beach behind us.

At first I didn't want to be one the guests that did that, but by the 3rd day, I needed a spot in the shade and the only way to get it was to put a towel and book down early. The hotel is about a 7 minute cab ride ($5 each way) and is totally worth it. Downtown is so cute! Lots of restaurants, bars, andhotels, shopping!

They main improvements are the addition of a pool and outdoor bar/seating area. Done very nicely. Also the rooms have been remodeled. The in-room bar (full bottles of booze!) is still there, which I find strange, since you can get drinks all day and night all over the property. Don't know who that appeals to.

At check-in, we were upgraded to a suite with an ocean view,without asking. I think acting like a superior American tourist gets you nowhere.

The place is beautiful, landscaping, buildings, rooms, pool, beach. It's all good. The front desk was always friendly and helpul. Carlos was awesome. Everyone spoke enough English to make you feel comfortable and welcome, but would help you learn a little spanish along the way. You do have to get out early to get a seat by the pool, but we enjoyed laying out by the beach (plenty of chairs). The palm trees are looking much better compared to earlier pictures. You can find some shade. All staff works so hard to make your stay pleasent. They are all greet you with a \"Hola!\" and a smile. So if you can, throw a couple dollars their way if you get a chance. They will appreciate it. It was true about leaving a couple of dollars each day for the maid, your room will get done early in the morning and plus they deserve it. It is also true with the drink guys who fill up your room refridgerator. They will keep it loaded up for you. Hope you like Corona beer. Only beer you will get. Bring lots of ones or go across the street and down a little ways to the shops and get some currency to tip out or buy things. It was fun for me to buy things with Mexican currency or to have my American money ready because I had already figured out the 10/1 ratio, pesos to the American dollar..Everything in the stores is usually in Pesos. So if you buy a drink for 250 pesos, that is about $2.50. 500 pesos = 5.00, 1000 = 10.00 and so on. They will appreciate if you have this figured out. It will make their job easier. Ok, back to the Yucatan. Dining...The Buffet was always great. You can always find something you like. I especially loved eating outside on the patio at breakfast.

Many an evening was spent supping cocktails and being entertained by the brilliant bar staff. Not that I'm a great drinker mind, but the long cool drinks are a welcome relief after a hot days' work, basking in the sun or out sightseeing, soaking up the culture and scenery of this beautiful country. I actually looked forward to mealtimes, not being the one cooking for a change! There was such a wide variety of international dishes (hot and cold) to choose from, that I dare anyone to come forward and say there was nothing they fancied! The room cleaning service is impeccable with fresh towels daily, top up toiletries and and replenished minibar! On our second trip we were disappointed at the location of our room, so asked the reception personnel if we could be located in the block that we stayed in the previous year. The following day, we were in the room next to our one last year - as I said nothing is too much trouble. What really made my holiday the second year, was that with so many holidaymakers passing through the hotel each year, some of the staff actually remembered us being there, that's what I call a personal touch. :o) And we made some new friends too, whom I hope we will see again in June.

We are a couple in our early 30's from Toronto, CAnada. Overall, a great trip, great resort. But I will give you our HONEST opinion. As with all resorts, there are pros and cons - but this resort definitely has more pros. Please don't see this as a negative review, I'm really only writing this to give you some tips that may help your stay. Ok, first the cons: - although we are in Mexico, many of the staff did not speak even conversational english. It was difficult/frustrating when you needed something and they didn't understand. They would many times just say \"sorry\" and not help (which is their job isn't it?). But they are very friendly nonetheless. - hard beds (but if you ask the front desk, they'll make it softer by adding a few layers of fluffy blankets) - food from the buffet was just OK. But there's lots of it, and definitely something for everyone. The Meditaranian restaurant was our favorite. - Reserving chairs at the pool!!!! By far our biggest complaint...good luck finding a place by the pool. You have to get up no later than 7am if you want a chair by the pool. At 7am, all you see is orange towels on the chairs but NO PEOPLE. The worst is, some people would not show up until 11am or noon and then claim their chair....so unfair. Now for the pros: - location is perfect - the pool is beside the beach. - beach is beautiful, its like being in a warm bath with bath salts...I miss it! - there are monkeys on the premises - the waiters/bartenders are very friendly - lots of activities for kids Other things we learned: - tip the staff, they really deserve it. I've never seen people work so hard and for so many hours. - For couples who want a more \"mature\" crowd, just be aware this place is really family driven. - go into Playa Del Carmen at night. Its a lot of fun, there's good shopping, good restaurants/bars. - If you have the money to spend on a night out at a restaurant, go to Casa Aqua on 5th Avenue - it was probably one of the most beautiful restaurants we've ever been to. Perfect way to spend our last night there. It cost us $100 USD for 2 but we had alcohol, appetizers, main course, etc. The atmosphere was incredible (live jazz band, waterfall, overlooking ocean, dimly lit, amazing staff) - If you want to go scuba diving find out the medical restrictions ahead of time. We were all geared up to go, took the transportation to get there, and once we got there discovered that due to high blood pressure medication my husband was on, we couldn't go. It would have been nice to know this before we paid the $170 USD and went all the way there. - If you have kids (or if you are kids at heart), go to Xel-Ha, its like the Disney World of water parks...except its a natural environment with no artificial water rides. We had a blast snorkling and water tubing among other things. It's $60 USD all inclusive (water activities, food, drink, etc.) They also have dophin swimming for extra cost. I can go on and on, but in the end, I would 100% recommend this resort and the other RIU hotels in Playa del Carmen. We will be going back for sure.

Firstly, let me begin by saying an All Inclusive Resort is not my cup of tea, however we were attending a wedding (22 people). And I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Beach: Very nice, white sand, blue waters, not much shade on the beach due to the palm trees bearing a little destruction during last years hurricane. Water was calm for 4 of the 7 days of our stay. During the calm days you can participate in kayaking, paddleboating and general swimming. For a fee you can rent seadoo's and parasail also. Vendors are limited on the beach and do not pester you to purchase or buy. If the waters are too choppy they place red flags on the beach to eliminate tourists swimming on dangerous waters - however, you always get the 10 - 15 people who ignore the warnings. Staff: Wow the staff work really hard in this resort, everyone from the waitstaff, bartenders, gardeners, maids etc. This place is runs like a clock. Shows: Rubbish and quite agonizing to watch, however after a few rums and coke the pain diminishes somewhat. Food: Something for everyone. The food is good. I was apprehensive while reading previous reviews. I must admit the buffet is better than the various restaurants at the Riu. The Wedding couple choose to have their dinner at the Steakhouse, and I must say the steak wasn't good. But hey - Mexico isn't known for its steaks, so it was no big surprise there. I would stick with the buffet. They have everything there and you won't leave hungry or disappointed. Wedding couples: For those wanting to get married there. 3 locations are offered, the gazebo/garden; the chapel in the Palace next door, or the beach. The couple's whos wedding we attended choose the chapel. It is small and quite quaint - you won't be disappointed. They do about 6 weddings a day at the resort. The ceremony was quick but adequate. Their photographer did a great job and he takes photo's at all the locations, so it doesn't matter really where you get married, as the photographer takes pictures all over the resort. What kind of people would enjoy this resort: Great resort for families. Everyone from kids to grandparents were in our group of 22 - and all age groups had a good time. I wouldn't choose this if I was a couple hoping to have a quite romantic getaway. Look for another resort/location for that. It is more of a family oriented resort. Lots of Europeans and Brits (due to the Euro and Sterling strength). Then the usual Yanks and Canadians too. Taxis: $5 into town. $40 to airport. You can deal your way down if you want - but this is the max you should pay. Shopping: Shopping is done in town Playacar, also a small shopping plaza/area right outside the hotel area. Remember if it is street vendors to haggle your way down - DO NOT pay asking. And if they are asking too much, walk on - there's plenty of other stores. Dollar or Peso: I made the mistake of converting to Peso's. If you are Canadian its not worth it, just exchange into US you will save yourself money that way. The exchange on the Peso and conversion was better with the dollar. ATM: There is a Scotiabank in town. There is an ATM at the airport and ATM in the small plaza area Security: Very good. Playacar village takes note of every license plate entering the village area. Be careful though - one of our party was carrying their baby in a store and they were pickpocketed. They got the hotel key, the security key and $100. So when they got back to the hotel they had to have the locks changed. They didn't change them till the next day. So needless to say the person and her husband slept with the dresser bolting the door (didn't want a Barcelo Maya slit throat situation). You have to keep your wits about you - the cab drivers and store keepers are all looking to make a buck. So be careful, they are a poor country and you are not visiting real Mexico Playacar/Playa del Carmen I would more call Americo :-)) So be careful even though there is security etc. Pool/Chairs: One of our party went to watch the sunset at around 6am - and yes there were people up putting their towels on their chairs. Honestly. However, we never had a problem getting a chair etc. Gym: There is a gym. It is very busy in the mornings. There is no airconditioning in the gym - so its not the best conditions to work out in. Also, the equipment is very basic, but adequate enough to get a work out. There is a bike, treadmill, eliptical and weights (free and universal). Tours: All of us did various tours and the best was Alltournative. We ripped roped the jungle area, had a shamanic ceremony with the shaman, visited the ceynotes and snorkled and swam them - AMAZING !!!! Oh and had lunch there too. That seemed to be the best one for value, money and adventure. I would recommend it for 11 years and up. This is an Eco Tour also so you learn a lot, you are also helping the indiginous Mayan's too via Alltournatives. As they work with the Mayan people. Well I think I have covered it all.

The older boys walked over to the RIU Tequila at night, but never found much going on for their age. There is a walk way between the hotels, so I felt safe letting them. The grounds are very clean and the staff works so hard. They really appreciate the tips. The only complaint I have is about the dress code. There wasn't one.

It may help, although theres always someone ready to reserve at 5.00am! We met a couple from the Tequilla who were saying that there they have started to toughen up there and if reserved sunbeds are left unattended for an hour or more, then the belonging are removed so others can use the beds. Always plenty of sunbeds on the beach though. Plenty of choice with the buffet, there is always something that will appeal, even if you are a fussy eater.

First they put you off by claiming that the air conditioning will be repaired. After you give up on repairs, they tell you that the air conditioning is not working well anywhere in the resort (not particularly useful in a supposedly 5-star resort).

We had arranged our transfers through Lomas Travel, who we\u2019ve used in the past. We paid a small premium of only $10 per passenger for a \u201cprivate transfer\u201d\u2026.it was well worth it at twice the price. Rather than waiting around for a van to fill and stopping 2-3 times prior to arriving at our resort, we were put in our own air-conditioned sedan (after a short wait, just long enough to grab a beer) and got us to our resort in record time. On arrival, there was no wait to check in and no wait for our room. Our very cheerful desk clerk took care of everything and explained in great detail all the dining, bars, where things were located and such. The bellman took us to our room immediately. Quick glances at the minibar revealed no diet soda, so we gave him a tip and were kept in diet Pepsi (\u201cPepsi Light\u201d) for the week; he also got us ice. Our room was standard Riu; somewhat compact but certainly roomy enough for two\u2026.a family of four might be a bit snug. Everything was very clean. Two extremely firm double beds pushed together (why do they do that?), very sufficient drawer space, good-sized closet with plenty of hangers. Nice sized lanai with table and two chairs \u2013 we were on the ground floor. We were able to sit outside and sip cocktails in the shade and watch those little rabbit-like creatures (what are those things anyway?) wander around. The area around the rooms was also pretty quiet. We were about halfway between the main building and the beach. We weren\u2019t overly wild about the bathroom. The sink, vanity, and minibar were separated from the sleeping area only by a curtain (which did close), with a separate tiny room for the toilet. There was a shower, but no tub. Not really an issue, but the shower had a very slow drain and there was no light, and only a very tiny space for soap, shampoo, etc. Shower gel and shampoo were provided in little paper packets; I would have preferred bottles or a dispenser. The pool area is very spacious and close to the beach. There are two pools that are connected; one is a \u201cquieter\u201d pool while one has more activities and such. Personally, I would prefer one be an adults-only pool, but that\u2019s just me. Chair-saving was REALLY bad; if you hadn\u2019t saved seats by 7 a.m. you were out of luck. If you wanted space under a palapa, you needed to be out by 6. I wish for once some of these places would have the cojones to actually ban this practice AND enforce it. Four different bars were located around the pools; both the walk-up and swim-up variety. Bar service was cheerful and pretty efficient. We liked Maribel at the swim-up bar, who liked to chat and practice her English on us. One point \u2013 unless you ask, they poor rather cheap domestic liquor that\u2019s really pretty dreadful. They do carry international brands, you just need to remember to ask when you order. The beach is in excellent condition. We stayed at the Riu Palace right next door last year, and the beaches are bigger this year than they were last year, even at the Riu Playacar, where there beach erosion was pretty severe last year. The only evidence we saw of the hurricane was some slightly frazzled palm trees, otherwise you\u2019d never know anything had happened. In downtown Playa the damage was a little bit more in evidence, but not severely so (other than the total destruction of Se\u0144or Frog\u2019s). Most noticeable was the lack of crowds. Dining was a pretty positive experience. We ate our breakfast each day in the main restaurant, which had a good selection, including some rather odd items that probably appeal to their more international clientele. Lunches were at the poolside buffets; there was one larger and one smaller; the smaller one is a little more hidden and therefore quieter. We were there four nights in all; we dined in the main buffet the first night, which was fine. The specialty restaurants at the Riu are sort of a set menu and require reservations. Again, if you wanted reservations for the early seating (6:45 p.m.) you needed reservations made by 7:30 a.m. or so, otherwise dinner was at 8:30, a bit late for us. We dined at each of the three; first at the steak house which had a set menu for salad, appetizer and desert, with a couple of different steaks to choose from, along with chicken and ribs. We each had a rib-eye, which was tasty though a bit tough \u2013 one doesn\u2019t expect great beef in Mexico, especially when you\u2019re from the Midwest. Next night was at the Mediterranean restaurant, which was an all-seafood menu\u2026.again similar, with the salad, appetizer, and desert all set, and a variety of seafood dishes to choose from. This was excellent. The final night was the Asian restaurant, which was my least favorite. This one was served buffet style, starting with a selection of salads and sushi, miso soup, a few entr\u00e9e items and desert. Only benefit in my mind was higher-quality wine in this one than the others; my companion liked this one more than me, but mostly for the sushi. We were advised we could use the facilities and restaurants at the Riu Tequila and Playacar, though not for dinner. We did have drinks at the Tequila one evening and were in the disco there on two evenings. Though the info I\u2019ve seen on the indicates that they do not accept spring break students at these properties, we discovered otherwise; not so much at the Yucatan but the Tequila was loaded with them. Security kept a close eye on them but it made the disco not-so-much-fun.

The food is good--the buffets are lavish and the food is very fresh. Tons of fruit, and lots of kid-friendly options (pizza, pastas). The guacamole is fabulous. There are machines so you can make espressos and cappucinos, and even the brewed coffee is okay (bring along a travel mug). The 3 restaurants (you need to make reservations for these) are good, but the menus are limited (4-6 entrees) and don't change from day to day. Still, sometimes you might prefer to be served a meal (and it's hard not to overeat when confronted with all the buffet choices).

Unfortunately, the air conditioning wasn't very effective, and the room was always kind of damp (we heard others complaining of a musty smell in the rooms).

The shower pressure was good (but the water isn't--not drinkable, and left our hair like straw, altho this is typical of many places in Mexico) The room has a small terrace, nice to relax with coffee or a drink. You can hear the people in the rooms around you when they come and go--the doors tend to slam, but it is quiet inside the room. The TV gets a couple of US channels.

The front desk had no record of my request and we ended up with one ground floor room in building 1 and one across the way on the second floor in building 1. Not what we were wanting but not a big problem. It appears that Wilma helped repair the beach erosion from last year. The beach seemed bare with the loss of all the palm trees that fell in the ocean last year and then the remaining ones losing their tops to Wilma this fall. But, nothing could spoil the beautiful blue water. The dinner at the buffet was pretty bad the first night but thankfully improved every day. It does seem however that ALL the RIU\u2019s have cut back on their food choices. There is still plenty to go around and if you can\u2019t find something you like you must be VERY picky. Being American I must say the food is geared toward the Europeans. (The Europeans probably think its American).

They don\u2019t enforce the \u2018men wear long pants and no tank tops for men at dinner rule\u2019. I kinda wish they did. I\u2019m not big on men with hairy arm pits reaching over the food I\u2019m about to eat. The grounds and rooms were spotless. Look around and you\u2019ll see someone scrubbing something somewhere. We had no problem at all finding chairs at the beach. We never got down there until 10 or so. Sometimes it was even after lunch. The pool however was another story. At 6am you will see cushions turned over or towels covering the chair and sometimes you will find several chairs tied together. We never wanted to lay at the pool but I definitely wouldn\u2019t have sat on the ground while there were chair after chair with only a towel on it for hours at a time. They have a new bar at the pool that\u2019s very convenient for those at the beach. The lobby bar was great. If you stop in be sure and tell Benito hi. He was wonderful! The rooms of course were musty but if you keep the AC on its fine. We didn\u2019t have towels one day but a quick call to the front desk resolved that in just a few minutes. The front desk called later to make sure towels had been delivered. I left a note on the fridge asking for the Corona to be refilled EVERY day. That and a $2 tip each day allowed my husband to have plenty of beer. I always take a soft 6-pack cooler with us and we take it to the beach since he doesn\u2019t like draft beer. We also left $2 on the bed each day and our room was always cleaned while we were at breakfast. The weather wasn\u2019t as nice as in years past but we still had a great time. The Yucatan is great but I personally prefer the RIU Playacar, but would definitely go back to the Yucatan.

We were at the Riu Yucatan from Feb 19 - Feb 26. There were 4 adults who went with 5 teenagers ranging in age from 16-18 so we needed to stay somewhere to accommodate all. Overall, the Riu Yucatan was a great time. Plenty of food, drink, pleasant people all around, and the staff at the hotel were extremely friendly with a smile for all. The biggest complaint of all would have to be getting chairs by the pool and finding out half way through the trip that apparently people tipped the morning cleaning crew to hold seats which then were left empty the majority of the day. After a complaint to the manager of this, it was amazing how the manager was out the next morning and there were chairs available. However, you still had to get out by 6:00 a.m. if you wanted one. The chairs on the beaches were plentiful. The entertainment group were a lot of fun (Crazy George was the best). They made sure that there were plenty of activities to be had and if you chose not to participate, they left you alone. Only a few nights where the entertainment was not up to par, but the group made a great comeback our last two nights there with a couple of comedy shows. By staying at the Riu Yucatan you had access to the Riu Tequila which is where a lot of the younger kids hung out (of course, they would go there after midnight). You felt very safe letting your kids walk between the resorts because they were all a short distance away and had security guards at each entrance. Town is just a $5 cab ride away with plenty of stores for shopping and nightlife to be had if you want it. The hotel was clean (I never saw so many employees work so hard); and, with a small tip to housekeeping you always had your room made up first in the morning and plenty of fresh towels. I would definitely return to the Riu Yucatan!!!", "Date": "March 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ankeny, IA", "Title": "\u201cHad a great tiem with friends\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4565000", "Content": "We were at the Riu Yucatan 2/8 thru 2/15.

The rooms were clean and the service was exceptional. Room refreshments were kept current and if something was needed it was brought prompty. The food was good but repetitous. The buffet line activity was as organized as the water when chumming for sharks. The dress code was non-existant. Men in shorts, tee shirts without collars and sandles were commonplace. We ate at all three of the reservation required resturants and found the food good and the service exceptional. But we had a good time.

The beach did suffer some damage....at least the trees. The pictures before the hurricane showed lots of trees, not too many now, so getting shade can be a problem.

You'll find the sign for Senor Frogs but the building is lost at sea.

While walking to our room, we knew this was going to be a great vacation because the grounds were beautifully manicured and everyone including the staff was smiling. As for our room, our only complaint was that the hair dryer didn't work, no big deal because my girlfriend brought hers anyways. Every room has a stocked fridge with bottled water, soda, and Corona (which they have on tap there). Also they have a minibar with four bottles of gin, vodka, rum, and tequila. Didn't use it but we thought was very convenient. I particularly liked the balcony that every room has. The staff there were very friendly and always upbeat. They always offered an \"Hola\" and never treated you with disrespect. Just show them some respect by tipping and trying to understand their language, after all you are in their country. The pool area was just as beautiful as the landscape, with two pool bars and plenty of chairs and palapas. Then there was the beach. Gorgeous white sand, countless palm trees for some shade (which you will need), relatively calm, turquiose blue waters, and again plenty of chairs. If you get up early enough you will have no problem scoring a chair. And don't worry about putting a towel on a chair to claim it, it seemed like that was standard practice there. Bring sunscreen if you burn because you will down here and it is very expensive if you don't have it. Now for the food and restaurants. We live in a state that has very good food at many fine restaurants. So we are used to great food and these restaurants had us wanting more of the food that they offered. From the buffett to the sit down restaurants, which you must make reservations for during breakfast. The buffett had a nice variety with something for everyone and the food was very fresh. We only tried the Steakhouse and the Mediterranean restaurants, we didn't bother with the Chinese one because we loved the buffett so much. The both of those dining experiences were fabulous and tasty. The staff work very hard to make that possible, so show them some love by throwing them some tips.

We found that the rooms were also well cleaned except for one day when we noticed a bit of skimping. A few things were skipped when it came to cleaning the room that one day. No big deal though. We were really never in the room except to get cleaned up to go out for the night or just to sleep in. We had stayed at the Riu Palace 2 years before and there is no comparison. The Yucatan was good but its no Palace. If you have a few extra bucks, stay at the Palace. Less kids and better food and much more relaxing. We have no kids so its nice to not have any around. The Yucatan has alot of guest rooms and that makes for alot of people. Be prepared for a crowded pool area with alot of action and people watching. Set your alarm so you can get up early to get your seats around the pool. Seats go fast. Food was good but nothing fantastic. We've been to other all inclusives and this place probably ranks low compared to others. Buffets were somewhat the same every night and day. Some people that really made our trip fun were a few of the bartenders and we would like to thank them for doing a great job!

Really enjoyed the dance lessons in the day, especially when they got a band on the beach, together. And Mexican night was fun, can't get enough of their music and dancing!! Animation team tried really hard to entertain all day and night, although at times i found them quite irritating when I was trying to relax and they are constantly nagging you to play volleyball etc. Tip for the girls Elvis is HOT!!!! ....And Supertony...Very sleazy, got a little tired of him asking to go for \"romantic\" walks on the beach, and they ask you every evening to go to mambo-cafe which is a very cool place to be(they get commission for how many tourists they bring in!) So watch out for sisters/daughter/wives age between 14-21 and my advice is to be quite blunt as they will not take the hint!!! Bar staff was excellent, so entertaining, friendly, up for a laugh and efficient. Cocktails were ok, I had heated tequila with cinnamon one night, which was really nice, and suprisingly Champaign was really good. Really recommend going to Cancun for jungle safari, you get to drive speed boat then park in middle of ocean for snorkelling over Corel-was a brilliant day and our guide Charlie was brilliant. I recommend this hotel for families of different ages, not really the place for relaxation as the beach (although very beautiful)was very busy and your asked atleast every half hour to join in an activity and there is NO getting away from that! There were a few rowdy people there that could have spoilt it, one girl from USA was sick in the swim up bar (ewwwwww got her to shut up though!).

We stayed at the Riu Yucatan in the Playacar area of PDC. This was my second winter getaway as I went to the Dominican last year. Although I would not go back to the DR I would go back to the Mayan Riviera in a heartbeat! Although I didn't really feel that I got to soak up a lot of Mexican culture (very touristy area), I must say that the people of Mexico are very friendly and have great sense of humours to put up with all of the tourists (some Americans, a lot of Canadians and many, many Europeans). Below is my very long (but good) review. RESORT ROOMS- We were in room 6210 which was on the second floor and closest to the pools, beach and theatre. The room was extremely clean and spacious. There was plenty of drawers and closet area to keep your clothes organized. There was also a well working hair dryer and alarm clock (so you don't have to pack those things). For the amount of time that you actually spend in your room I don't feel that upgrading to a suite is worth the money (unless maybe you have small children that require naps or go to bed early and want more seating area) The beds and pillows were not the most comfortable (but nothing beats your own). The air conditioning worked very well and we had a very large balcony which was great after a long day at the beach. There was a clotes rack on the balcony that made drying bathing suits, etc convenient. The bathroom had a shower with great pressure and hot water. The vanity area was nice and large so 2 people could easily use it at the same time. We had a liquor dispenser with Rum, Vodka, Tequila and Gin. We also had a minifridge that was stocked regularly with Corona, Pepsi, 7-up, Orange Soda and many large bottles of water. My only concern for this room is that since it is right next to the theatre it is quite loud until about midnite...so if noise bothers you request another block or take earplugs if you go to bed early. RESTAURANTS BUFFET---9/10 The buffet was excellent. I am somewhat of a picky eater and I always found lots of different things to eat and everything was hot and fresh. You do not require reservations at the buffet restaurants. Breakfast always had different types of eggs, french toast, pancakes, bacon, sausage, hasbrowns, cereals, fresh fruit, yogurts, juices and smoothies. Lunch was both in the main buffet as well as the resturant by the pool. Various salads, burgers, hot dogs, pasta, and pizza was served. Supper once again had lots to offer. You can choose from various varieties of fish, pork, beef, chicken. There were also different salads, side dishes such as pasta, pizza, fries, etc and a Mexican corner offered different things including toastados, quesedillas, etc. Lunch and supper included many, many different desserts to choose from (including my favourite coconut ice cream). ASIAN RESTAURANT---9/10 Reservations were required for this restaurant for supper. It was served buffet style and had much too choose from. They served salads, sushi, lemon chicken, peking, duck, spring rolls, vegtables, fried rice and even deep fried ice cream! STEAKHOUSE---8/10 Reservations were required for this restaurant for supper. It was served a la carte style. The meal included ceasar salad, soup and your choice of a main entree (steak, ribs, shishkabobs). The meat was tender and tasty; However, I would suggest that you ask for your steak to be done a little more than you would normally ask for. MEDITERRANEAN---6/10 Reservations were required for this restaurant for supper. It was served a la carte style. The meal included shrimp/avacado salad, soup and your choice of 1 of 4 main entrees. All entrees were seafood. We were disappointed that they did not serve anything like lobster...just fish, salmon and a seafood casserole which included calamari, clams and shrimp. BARS All the bars had very friendly bartenders that loved to joke around and provide great entertainment. A special hello goes out to Alfredo, Fernando and Rodger. Some drinks were stronger than others (depends who made them). The fruit drinks were a bit on the sweet side. Corona draught was served nice and cold. The pool bars open at 10 am. The theatre bars closed at midnite but the lobby bar was open until 7 am and would reopen at 10:30 am. We also went to the sports bar at the Riu Tequilla and could play a game of billards for 20 pesos. We did not go to the disco at the Tequilla. POOLS The pools were large and not overly used at the ocean was warmer. The jacuzzis were not heated and had some debris from trees floating in them. There was daily aqua-gym and waterpolo games. There were many palapas around the pool if you wanted shade; However, it was best to lay your towel out on a lounger no later than 8am. BEACH The beach was spacious, clean and very busy. Somedays the water was very calm and clear; However, we had quite a few days were the water was redflagged and the waves came pounding in. Boogie boards supplied by the resort were great for those rougher days. There are a few merchants on the beach trying to sell you things; However, a simple 'no gracias' was enough for them to leave you alone. Once again, you must be sure to claim your lounger by 8 am to get a good spot on the beach (but please only do that if you will be using it immediately after breakfast). RESORT STAFF The staff was absolutely wonderful here. Reception would offer advice on places to see or do and would ask how your lastest excursion was. The animation staff were hardworking and very friendly. They did their best to get people involved with different activities including dancing, Spanish lessons, beach volleyball, crazy games, etc. If you needed something for your room a quick phone call to reception fixed things immediately. Every nite there was a different show at the theatre. Some nites were better than others. At times there was a live band playing before and/or after the show so dancing was encouraged. EXCURSIONS XCARET A cab ride was $11 to this park. The main entrance fee was $59 US. There was plenty to see here such as parrots, dolphins, fish aquarium just to name a few. You can easily spend hours walking around. You can also go to the beach which is enclosed so the water is always calm. There are also a variety of restaurants to choose from. I highly recommend the bar at the top of the hill by the beach as the view is amazing!! XEL HA A cab ride was $40 to this park. The main entry fee was I believe $33 US. The only thing to really do here is snorkel and I was disappointed that it wasn't very good. We swam with some larger Groupers and Snappers; However, there was not much to see for small and colourful fish. CHICHEN ITZA We took a tour through our Sunquest rep for $75 US/pp. This was a very long day but enjoyable. The ruins are very interesting to see and there were merchants trying to sell you everything. Along the way we stopped in a small town for lunch and did some shopping. DOLPHIN DISCOVERY We got a great deal through our Sunquest rep to swim with the dolphins and go snorkelling for just $99 US/pp!!! A group of about 10 swam with the dolphin Izamel at Dolphin Discovery (in Puerto Adventuras) for about 1 hour or so which was an amazing experience. We then went out and did a guided snorkel for about 45 minutes right off the beach. Although this snorkelling was better than Xel Ha, it still was not as good as it would have been if we did a tour with a boat right out to the reefs. TULUM We did not check out the ruins at Tulum but we did do some shopping (not a lot of stores to choose from) and went to a beach. The beach was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. It was not busy and the sand was almost like flour...wow!! COZUMEL We took the ferry from PDC to Cozumel for 110 pesos each way. We then rented scooters from Ernestos for just $25 (plus a $50 returnable deposit and $5 for fuel). We drove around the whole island and made a couple of beer/beach stops along the way. It was sad to see the devastation left behind from the hurricane. Many stores were closed in the main town and shopping and restaurants were more expensive than PDC. PLAYA DEL CARMEN We took a $5 cab ride into PDC many times. 5th ave is a great place to shop, shop and shop!! There were also a lot of great restaurants to stop at for a beer or snack. The merchants were all very friendly and not overly pushy. Everywhere you looked there was silver, vanilla, t'shirts, and pottery to purchase.

We all had a loveley time and would happily go back. GROUNDS. They were really nice and recovering well after the Hurricane, some of the palm tree leaves are a little short although otherwise you would never have noticed, essentially the hotel is 100% recovered. ROOM. Clean, tidy and well maintained. Mini bar with four spirits and bottle drinks were changed every other day. Drink included Bottled water, Korona, Pepsi, 7up and Fizzy Orange. A free safe was also in our room. FOOD/DRINK. A good variety of food was available throughout the holiday. Drinks were good and you never had to wait to be served. The only complaint was small beer glasses ment having to go back to the bar constantly. Tequila slammers were also enjoyable. STAFF. All very friendly and hardworking and definatley earn there money, hardly anyone tipped which is no surprize as there is no need to carry money around with you in the hotel. We tipped some of the staff on our last day and they were very grateful (they earn around $30 per month) WEDDING. The wedding co ordinator was very helpful and arranged almost everything. We paid for the photographer and also a DVD of the wedding. Both the photos and DVD were produced to a very high standard and I would have no hesitation in recommending them both. There are three places you can get married when staying at the Yucatan. THE BEACH- Not very personal and they do attract large groups of people watching (most men in speedos)the photos may well have the crowds in the background. THE GARDENS- Situated near the reception it is more private and would make a nice location. THE CHAPEL- This location is situated in the recpetion area of the RIU Palace next door and was not initially offered to us although was recommended by our holiday rep. A really stunning private place to get married which is the one we chose. It was just as well we chose this location as it rained all day. We were hoping for pictures on the beach although the ones in the hotel were really nice anyway. If anyone has any questions about getting married in the hotel I would be more the happy to answer any questions.

They also put on shows in the evening, which were average to good. I would not recommend this hotel for couples, most of the people there had young children that were allowed to run riot around the pool, screaming and splashing and kicking over your drinks, while the parents did nothing about it. For that reason alone I would not stay at this hotel again. Also due to the damage sustained to the area of Cancun our hotel was probably fuller than normal with the overspill of people who couldnt stay in Cancun. We were told by other holidaymakers that the gang of lads who were there at the same time as us should have been on an 18-30 type holiday in Cancun. They were an embarrassment to the British, and I dont think the tour company should have upgraded these people to the Yucatan who probably paid a lot less than the rest of us. The drinks were pretty average, the cocktails too sugary and syrupy. The food was okay, plenty of it, but somedays we enjoyed it very much. The steak restaurant was the best out of the a-la-cartes.

I love Mexico in general and could probably live there. My partner and I have taken many trips together in Mexico and caribbean countries and the resorts are roughly the same. People choose resorts for different reasons, for us the quality of the beach is a priority. Here's our breakdown: BEACH: The water was too rough. The pounding waves made for an uninviting swim. In addition, we will not go to Mexico in January again -- it was simply too cold. Maybe it got up to 70 degrees (at the most). Otherwise, the beach itself was clean. Since it is so windy, you might prefer a chair by the pool, for which you must stake claim by 7 a.m. if you want a lounge chair under an umbrella for shade. FOOD: Decent. My only complaint is that we got in around 5:30 from Xel-Ha and I wanted a snack. I went over to Margarita which is supposed to be open for a snack and it was not. At that time, there was nowhere for me to get something to eat. otherwise, the breakfast buffet and lunch are both great. The themed restaurants are Japanese (which I don't like) and \"Mediteraneo\" which I mistook for Mediteranean food and it was NOT that -- it was seafood. I really enjoy eating breakfast overlooking the beach -- couldn't do that at this resort. The drinks were plentiful and flowing. POOLS: Great. I wish they had a hot bubbling jacuzzi however. There is a kiddie pool too. ROOM: Clean and serviced daily. A word of advice -- bring slippers. All resorts, not just this one, have an uncarpeted tiled floor. This can be somewhat unpleasant. Plus we had a nice little balcony to dry clothes. there was a TV with many channels. Alcohol bottles upside down in the bathroom (Jose Cuervo, Rum, Vodka) and a fridge with soft drinks and water. Also, we had a mosquito in the room on the first night which bit me twice. ENTERTAINMENT: Nightly. This is not my thing, but I am aware they play little games and have various types of shows. These are loud and last until midnight. Do not plan on falling asleep until they are over. All resorts are like this. XEL-HA: We took this trip. It costs about $87 per person and we think it was worth it but only each can judge for him or herself. The price includes snorkeling, tubing, bicyling and all food and drinks. We had a nice steak lunch with drinks which would have cost $50 alone in any restaurant. There are other activities too that cost extra. The water and variety of fish here were outstanding! ADVICE: Bring plenty of ones and fives. The front desk does not provide change. The taxi ride into town to go shopping is $5 and we needed change for a $20. It was raining that night and the resort let us borrow an umbrella for free. IN A NUTSHELL: The best resort I have been to so far, in terms of quality of the beach, is Breezes Bahamas. Riu Yucatan was a nice experience but not unusual as far as resorts go. This resort attracts a wide variety of guests especially from US/ Canada, England, Italy and France.", "Date": "January 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amhersturg, Ont.", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!\u201d", "Author": "shilee3", "ReviewID": "UR4368003", "Content": "We arrived to the Yucatan at about 9:30pm, we were greeted with a welcome drink, and a Hola!

The drinks were what ever you wanted, if you wanted more alcohol, they put more, if you wanted none they didn't put none. The Tequilla, looked a little more grand than the Yucatan and Playacar, but I think they were making up for there not being a beach, I liked the yucatan because the beach was right there, the Palace looked empty to me. I don't know if i'm the only one, but I could not unlock my room door, the whole week, for some reason it isen't just a normal lock, if you go there you will see what I mean.

Clerk wanted to put us in Yucatan. We tried to get upgrade to Palace but they said they were also overbooked. We asked for a suite or room upgrade at Yucatan but all they could give us was a room closer to the beach. I do not know who is to blame (Apple or Riu) but I think Riu could have handled it a bit better. If an airline bumps you you get compensated with a free flight and sometimes and upgrade to BC or FC. At the very least they should have called us before we left to let us know they were overbooked. At that point we could have made other arrangements. We were upset that we did not get to stay at the place we booked because that is the place that we chose to stay. They insisted that the Yucatan was more expensive ( so we should infer that it was better ). There is not much you can do when you are already down there. When we got to our room I looked around. The room reminded me of Motel 6. The bed spread was thin and tattered in spots. The furniture was cheap and worn with some of the veneers chipped all around the edges, particularly the melamine dresser drawer inside the closet. The mini-fridge was rusted on the front (which is all we could see). The fridge was fully stocked but two of the 7-up bottles were opened and already half-empty. We did not have a screen door for the sliding glass door to the balcony. The safe was rusting but only cosmetically. The closet doors did not stay on track, they even came off and fell a couple of times. Bed was hard but tolerable. A/C was adequate for us. Volleyball court was ridiculous. Some kind of jerry rigged set up between two palmtrees. The net sagged and kept falling down. The other nearby resorts had much better courts set up. There was a patch of veneer missing on the front door. Prepared foods were so-so (I hear this is common at most resorts). Fresh foods were delicious - especially the guacamole and pico de gallo. As with every other buffet the cold foods and hot foods were all the same temperature - tepid! We ate at the steak house the second night we were there. The food was worse than sizzler. On a day that we were scheduled to have our fridge restocked we left a tip and a note - in Spanish - for house service. They took the money and did not even restock our fridge. A call to the front desk remedied that in 15 minutes. I did not like having to make reservations to eat dinner. The biggest thing they had going for them was the beautiful but eroded beach and water and the very friendly but not always helpful staff.

I love the Mexican feel of it. The room was great, every morning I woke up and went out on our balcony to enjoy the warm air and the sound of birds singing. Beds are a bit hard but no big deal, we still sleapt like lams. We saw many families there so if you have little ones, it's a good hotel for that. The staff have activities for them in the evening before the shows. The beach was great, soft white sand and clear turquoise water. Well, the first day it was clear but it was quite windy the rest of the week so we couldn't really see our feet touching the sand in the water, but it's all good. We saw some fish swimming around us. Some people were feeding them bread and they would jump out of the water to eat. Pretty cool. The pools seemed nice, we went in twice. We are beach people. We have pools in Canada but no Carribean sea close to us here so we took advantage! About the chairs, they get taken pretty quickly but we always found enough for the 5 of us. The food was very good. They have everything. I enjoyed the hot cocoa in the morning and the guacamole and torilla chips are the best. Very good. We ate at the Steakhouse 3 times because it is so good and we ate at the Asian restaurant once, it was not bad for me but my husband loved it. They have fried ice cream, mmmm. Everything is super nicely decorated, they made fish and pigs out of cheese and butter, super cool. The drinks were ok. They put plenty of alcohol in them but the juice is so sweet. Try the sangrias or stick to beer. The bars are very clean and the bartenders are quick and nice. We did two excursions, we went to Xel-Ha for a day. Very nice place. Beautiful bay to snorkel in, we walked trails, jumped off the rock of courage, good restaurant (those sangrias were good!). We booked this trip at Wal-Mart in Playa Del Carmen for almost half the asking price at the hotel. Look around, it's worth it. We also went to Coba. That was our favorite trip. It's a full day, you visit ruins by bike (there's a cost for bikes and you have no choice to take them so bring a bit of money), we swam in a cenote, visited a Mayan village, ate in a Mayan restaurant, crossed a river by zip-line and canoe, did rock decending, walked in the tropical forest and finished the day with a traditional Mayan ceremony. Great trip! We wanted to go to Xcaret but we ran out of time. Go for at least 10 days to 2 weeks. 7 days flew by. We visited Playa Del Carmen, which is a 25 minute walk from the hotel. Not long because you look around as you walk. 5th avenue is cool, pretty expensive stores, I didn't expect that. Further down are the huts to bargin in. They're not as open to bargining as other places we've been. (We ended buying most of our things at the little mini huts across the hotel at better prices.) Further down in Playa Del Carmen are the restaurants and bars. Super nice places. It felt safe and looked really rich. It's a very fun place to go. The shows at the hotel in the evenings were good. The mariaches were the best. We also loved the Mexican night. One night they had a band and fire dancers on the beach. All in all, this is a great resort.

The resort is beautiful and immaculate! There was always someone cleaning something here. The room was nice and very clean, although there was a musty smell to it. To be expected in such a humid place I guess. You may want to bring a can of disinfectant to get rid of the smell. The beds were hard, but not unbearable. The fridge was stocked every 2 days with 6 coronas, 2 pepsi, 2 7-up, 2 orange sodas and bottles of water. The liquor dispenser was a nice touch with a bottle of vodka, gin, rum and tequila. The location is great and the beach was beautiful. We had no problems getting chairs on the beach (we were usually down by 9am) but we couldn't get over all of the towels on chairs that people had reserved. Even though it never proved to be a problem for us, it was aggravating to see this day after day. And most of these chairs went un-used until mid afternoon. We did go snorkeling one afternoon with the Scuba Caribe guys. It was $60 for 2 of us and you have to reserve the day before. They take you out on a 15 minute boat ride to a reef and you snorkel for 45-50 minutes. It was a good experience and we saw a lot of fish. The mixed drinks were weak and they are really small, but the beer was good. The food was average, not great not bad just average. Everything seemed to have little taste, but it was ok. Breakfast was the best and they even had someone making fresh smoothies every morning. We ate at the Steakhouse which was pretty good and we also tried the Seafood restaurant and didn't like that at all. We did tip while at the bar and after dinner at the specialty restaurants. These people work so hard and they were especially entertaining at the bar near the pool at night. We were definitley in the minority when it came to tipping. We hardly saw anyone else do it. Another problem we had was with some of the kids at the resort. They seemed to run around unsupervised and were at the bars on a few occasions. It was later at night, after 10 and there would be children sitting at the bar just a couple of stools down. This really aggravated us, as a bar is no place for a child. We also walked over to the Tequila to go to the sports bar and the place was filled with kids at 10pm. There should be some regulation or rules about children at the bars at night. We walked one night to Playa del Carmen, which is not a far walk at all! Everyone complaining must get little to no exercise at home. It is maybe a 30 minute walk, but it felt good to get out and move a bit. Downtown wasn't what I expected so we only walked around a bit and then went back. If you are going to walk, just keep in mind that if it is dark out they dont have street lights and it is really dark walking back. We also went to the spa and got massages - those were great. I highly recommend doing those. One afternoon it rained and there was absolutely nothing to do, so be prepared. We sat out on our balcony and read and drank corona's.

We had our resort changed and our hotel but we were upgraded to the 5 star Riu Yucatan without extra charge. It was twice the size of the hotel we had booked further down the coast at Akumal and Playacar was obviously going to be busier but we accepted it because we really did want to go to Mexico. I have to say that our fears were unfounded and we had the best holiday ever. We were greeted by the hotel staff clapping and giving out cocktails and as a hotel receptionist had given us our wristbands and room keys on the transfer coach, we were able to go straight to our rooms without the usual scramble at the reception desk. Rooms were nice with two double beds, plenty of towels and toiletries that were replaced as used. Even a decent hairdryer. Juan Carlos kept our room spotless and made little animals out of the towels. There was a mini bar stocked every other day with water, beer and soft drinks as well as 4 optics giving us Gin, Vodka, Tequila and Rum. The hotel staff were all so helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. There were monkeys in the grounds but these disappeared after a few days and we never saw them again. Whether it was because as the days went on, more and people started to arrive though the hotel was never full. Following all the reviews we had read about people laying towels on beds to reserve them, we expected to have a problem finding a sun bed but it never happened. No matter what time we went by one of the two pools or on the beach we always found a place easily. All inclusive meant just that. Apart from giving some tips we never spent a penny in the hotel other than the initial phone call home. There was a good selection of drinks and the bar staff would even make a cocktail that wasn't on the menu. We thought the food was excellent with vast choices. The main restaurant offered everything you could think of and some you couldnt and there was also a Steak Restaurant which we ate in 3 times as it was so good, a Fish restaurant and an Asian restaurant, both of which we didnt try. There are always going to be some people who hate the hotel food but I can't imagine what they eat at home. If you enjoy fresh proper food like meat, fish, vegetables, salads, breads, cheeses, etc you will like the food. And the desserts were terrific. The beach restaurant open at lunchtime served more simple foods like burgers, hot dogs, pizzas, chips as well as meats, cheeses, salads, etc. We went into Playa del Carmen and found a travel agent where we booked a trip to Chitzen Iza for the two of us at less that the price of one offered by our tour operator and we did it again for another trip to Tulum. Instead of being cramped in a coach we travelled in style in an air conditioned taxi or mini bus. Much more comfortable and the driver tailored the trip to our requirements. Reception booked us in to swim with dolphins and there were only 5 of us rather than the usual group of 10 so don't be afraid to go it alone. 20,000 people lost their jobs as a result of the hurricane and they get nothing from the Mexican government. We knew that we were helping the Mexican economy rather than the English tour companies by being more independent as well as saving ourselves some money. We did get ripped off on our second day though in Playa del Carmen when we went to a beach bar for a drink. \u00a36 for two halves of shandy and then a trio of musicians appeared from nowhere and serenaded us and then we had to pay for the privilege. Obviously two mature ladies were an easy target but we laughed about it and learned a lesson. One of the things to watch out for is the local touts trying to get you to visit new hotels that are in the process of being completed. They say come and have breakfast with us and look round, no obligation and its hard to get away from them as they do it so nicely, but then they want you to bring a a credit card with you. We told them we did not possess a credit card (all lies!) and suddenly they weren't interested. So they are obviously trying to get you to buy something! One tip though, we had to pay both ways for overweight luggage and it wasnt cheap. Next time I shall take less clothes and shoes as you don't need them and will make sure I have lots of space in my case as everything you buy in Mexico is so cheap. I definitely want to return to Mexico and shall start saving. I have also to give Thomson Holidays a mention as their in report reps were excellent especially Christian and Lauren.", "Date": "December 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire, UK", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant\u201d", "Author": "PaulCheshire", "ReviewID": "UR4163931", "Content": "Had a great time, the Mexicans are really nice people and do everything it takes to ensure you have a great time.

You can use facilities at Riu Tequila and Riu Playacar (5-10 min walk to either). We did 'Chichen Itza' trip that was really intersting and a good day out with a nice meal, 'Jungle tour' - drive your own mini speed boat to go snorkelling on a reef - great value, and 'Dolphin Discovery' tour (Dolphin swim/Stingray swim/shark swim (shielded by perspex)/turtles/Golf buggy tour/All inclusive boat transfer to and from Island) - Amazing.

Advice Block's 4,5 and 6 seem to be best located for beach and pools. Best views will be in Block 4. I think rooms 4318, 4319, 4320 will have best views (4 being block number, 3 being floor and 18-20 being room numbers). Ask for that little bit extra alcohol in your cocktails. Depending on who serves you, depends on the measure, but tell them if you want a large one, otherwise you may end up sober. Don't let the usual towel placers get to you (They put a towel on the sunbed at really early hours of the morning, then go off for the day, its so annoying and causes other people to start doing the same thing, but don't let it annoy you). There is a little bit of beach actually between the Yucatan and the Riu Palace (Next door) that the cattle miss out on, use that for that extra space. Spend at least one night in Playa Del Carmen town. Blue Lobster does great food, and Blue Parrot is an excellent dance bar on the beach, where you sit on swings instead of bar stools. Its very safe. Mexicans are great, but in Playa del Carmen, they still do timeshare type set-ups disguised as 'Free or Cheap trip' huts... no matter how nice they are to you, avoid them, you won't get a good deal out of them, unless you want to waste a day walking around a random complex to save yourself an insignificant amount of money.", "Date": "December 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cVery enjoyable and a good bargain\u201d", "Author": "Mgz", "ReviewID": "UR4156570", "Content": "My wife and I decided to go last-minute to Mexico, and did not know which hotel we'd get until we landed in Mexico. For the price ($600 including air, tranfers and 5 nights at a beachside all-inclusive via Apple Tours), we decided it was worth the risk. We were very pleasantly surprised by our stay at the Riu Yucatan. Overall, it is a well-kept, peaceful but fun place with very helpful, friendly staff and a nice set-up. No, it's not a Four Seasons, but any issues I had were extremely minor and easily overlooked. THE GOOD... It was a short, pleasant ride from the airport, about 45 minutes door to door. The hotel is right on the beach, with two pools, each with pool bar, just steps away from a clean, clear sandy beach. With boogie boards and other non-motorized sports included, it was a blast to get knocked around by the surf. My 8-year old daughter had a terrific time, as did I. The pools are spacious, clean and, as mentioned, each serviced by a swim-up bar. Plus, there are two large bars right nearby for post-swimming. As others said, there were a lot of activities that the staff facilitated. My wife and I laughed at the aerobics class. The instructor was a well-built 20-something guy in a speedo, and he had about 40 women staring at him in total rapture for an hour. It was tough to be him :-). Rooms were a decent size, with two full sized beds pushed together (they could be separated), and enough room for a rollaway. The bath area was clean and large. The refrigerator was stocked with water, soda and Corona, all included, and there was a liquor bar above the fridge. Each room had a balcony or patio with room to sit, and lots of trees and landscape adding to the ambience. My daughter LOVED the kids camp. I didn't even know it was a feature until we arrived, and she had fun. One person in particular, \"King,\" was terrific with the kids. They also let the kids dance on the big stage at night at 8pm (actually, that's 8pm Mexico time, which is closer to 845p :-). Side trips: we did one excursion, the Mayan Snorkeling Adventure. It was a full day of snorkeling, lunch and transport for $78 pp (less for kids), and was a great value. However, I did learn that I am about done with snorkeling after an hour or so. Though we did not do this, the parasailing for two was $70 for about 15-20 minutes in the air. Food: OK, not great. In short, it's what I expected. The steak restaurant was decent (excellent service, decent food), the Japanese/Chinese restaurant offerings were not very good. The evening buffets could have used more variety from night to night. Nonetheless, food was perfectly fine. Lunches were standard fare, with pastas, pizza, burgers, dogs, salads. We enjoyed them, as well as the tremendous breakfast buffet. THE MINOR ISSUES Drinks were a little lame. I was not looking to get overserved, but the alcohol was barely detectable. The frozen drinks were not so frozen, so that was a little disappointing. I am not much of a Corona drinker, but that's all they have. Again, all minor pings, made less significant by the fact that all was included and the bartenders were fun. Entertainment: if you like retreads of Hollywood film music, have at it. It's not my cup of tea. Honestly, though, I did not go for the shows, so this was a moot point. I will say that the Mariachi (sp?) night was well performed, and they had a local band one evening before the main show that was very talented. And, of course, the beautiful girls in skimpy outfits one night was, um...artistic!! Parents: It was pretty clear to us and other parents we met that a number of people simply let their kids run around unsupervised. This was disappointing, and pretty pathetic on the part of the parents. The resort dealt with this as best they could, but I swear the ignorance of some parents was astounding. (Example: two 10-ish year old English boys, who were cursing like sailors, threw a pillow into a glass and cut a woman's forehead. The parent's response: boys will be boys). A bathroom a little closer to the pool would be nice. MY RECOMMENDATIONS / ADVICE - Go to the pool early to scout a seat. There are always seats, but the longer you wait, the further they are from the pool. - Make your dinner reservations early the first full day you are there. - Though tips are included, bring some cash (US or Mexican is fine) for tips. I think these folks do a great job, and a little extra helps. - Good cigar prices in the gift shop; enjoy! - Walk across the street to Riu Tequila for their sports bar. It's worth the short walk. - If you want less noise, get a room closer to the main hall / reception. The stage is near the pool, and thus rooms there get more noise. Even the furthest room from the pool is only about a 5-8 minute walk. - BRING YOUR OWN SUNSCREEN! It was SO expensive there: $25 a bottle. SUMMARY - If you are looking for a relaxing vacation by the pool or beach without the hassles of whipping out your wallet every 5 minute, this is a good choice.", "Date": "December 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, UK", "Title": "\u201cFab Holiday at the Riu Yucatan\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4147970", "Content": "We have just returned from a fantastic holiday in Mexico! We were the first group of holiday makers to visit since hurricane wilma and I have to say that we were nervous as to what to expect. As we drove from Cancun airport to the resort we could see the devastation wilma had caused but the nearer we got to Playacar the less the damage seemed (but it was still affected). The Riu Yucatan is a lovely resort, the beach is beautiful and the pool area is lovely with two swim up bars! We had no trouble getting sunbeds but it was very busy by 10am. There is loads to do in the day with activities provided by the entertainment staff including, beach volleyball, horseshoes, darts, football, bingo, pool arobics. There is also free tennis courts and free non motorised water sports including sailing, kayaking, pedlos and bodyboards. Staff - the staff throughout our holiday couldn't do enough for you and the entertainment team worked really hard getting you involved in activities round the pool and providing entertainment in the evening. Most of the shows on the evenings were really good and some of the dancing was very professional, some nights were filler nights with Miss Riu Yucatan competions but these were still entertaining (and cringy) to watch! Room - The only problem we had was that one of our rooms smelled damp we told reception about this and they said they would come and look at this, later on we went back to see if anything had been done and they offered us an alternative room, however when we went back to our room the smell had gone. There was some damp in the toilet which seemed to be causing it but they had painted over which resolved the problem. The smell never returned! The cleaners did a fantastic job, the room was cleaned every day and was spotless. The rooms are very comfortable with air con, sat tv (premiership games on fox tv!), and a nice balcony area. Wildlife - when we arrived there were these strange creatures which looked a bit like rats on long legs wandering around the place and monkeys! Trips - between the four of us we did three trips the best one was the dolphin discovery where we got to swim not only with dolphins but manatees (sea cows) and sealions. We all loved the manatees and it was an unforgetable experience. The trip is quite pricey at $179 each but it is well worth the money. They do rip you off with the DVD at $59 and the photos at $12 (and you can't take your own camera) but we bought the DVD anyway to remind us what a fantastic time we had. We also did the Jungle Tour and go to drive a speedboat for 45 mins each way and then do some snorkelling. The speedboat was brilliant but the snorkelling was not so good as the water was quite cloudy. The other couple in our group also did the Chichen Izta trip, again this was quite expensive at $105 each and was a three hour each way journey, however they really enjoyed it and said it was a very interesting trip with a nice lunch!! Food & Drink - We couldn't fault the food in the buffet restaurant, there is so much choice and being a fussy eater I thought it was great. We were not so impressed with the a la carte restaurants, they were ok but not as good as we expected (p.s. steer clear of the Rose wine as they have just mixed red & white wine together - it's vile!). The service at the bars was great however we got the feeling that the spirit were watered down as we didn't seem to get drunk and when I had a vodka and coke it tasted horrible. The beer was really nice (Corona on tap). In the end we took out a water bottle with vodka in from the optics in our room and topped up our drinks with this. When the vodka ran out it was replaced straight away. We had access to the Riu Tequilla which was nice to go to for a change, the Tequilla also has a small disco which was ok but very dark and smelled! I think it would have been good if the resort was busier. Airport - We had no problems with the airport on the way in there is a traffic light system and they only search you bags if you get a red light. On the way home they were searching everyones bag, but as we were a group of four they let us straight through. You have to pay a departure tax of $45 per person so bear that in mind and also we were told they are very strict with overweight bags and charge $12 per kilo over. We were smack on coming home but some people were over but we never saw anyone being charged. All in all we had a brilliant time and we would go back tomorrow! By the end of two weeks I think we were all looking forward to coming home as there is only really enough entertainment to keep you going for that long!", "Date": "November 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4146205", "Content": "Since I relied on reviews prior to our trip thought I should return the favor. We were rebooked to the Riu Yucatan after Hurricane Wilma damaged and closed our original choice in Cancun. Apple Vacations was fantastic and really took care of us. They provided transportation from the airport which was very convienient. Just walk past customs and look for the flowered shirt and Apple sign. We were lucky and didn't have to make numerous stops on either trip to the airport (approx. 1 hour). Some folks who stayed in Tulum had a 2 1/2 hour ride back to the airport. I was concerned about the affects of Hurricane Wilma on the resort and surrounding area but needn't have worried. The resort was beautiful. The jungle is not as thick as it was before but they have replanted all the plants and many new palm trees on the beach. It looks like a resort should and is unbelievably clean. We ate at all of the restraunts and were happy with the food. The buffets always have something that is cooked on the spot and was worth trying, especially the fish. It reminded us a lot of being on a cruise--the pool atmosphere, food etc. We hadn't been to Cancun before so not sure how to compare the beaches to pre-hurricane but we and our kids loved them. They were soft, white and warm. There were always chairs available and we were able to use the kayaks, boogie boards etc whenever we wanted. Chichen Itza was educational and worth the long ride to see/climb up. We paid more and used Apple because of the comfy bus and movie on the return trip. I think it was worth it since it was 6 hours on the road. The folks who took the van trips said they paid about half but the drive was tough--also took 6 hours. We had a guide who spoke on the way and really enjoyed learning about the Mayan culture. Our trip also included a swim in a Cenote. This was a highlight. We went on the Fat Cat Catamaran and loved it--thanks Jess for an amazing day. Booked through playainfo.com which came with a t-shirt that everyone else paid $15 for. As everyone else says the folks who work at the resort and the tours are amazing. I read somewhere to take $100 in ones for tips which we did. We could have used more as it was a pleasure to tip these hard working folks. We asked for 4 extra pillows and they were provided that day. Our fridge was always stocked with water, beer and sodas.

I understand that they're free (in a sense), but they were really weak and just didn't taste very good. Be very careful when eating off property (like on an excursion).

The rooms were clean and spacious and the mini bar was always kept well stocked. I particularly liked the beach location.After the first couple of days we always used the beach rather than the pool(it was very hot while we were there) and enjoyed the breeze as well as not having to get up at the crack of dawn to reserve a sunbed!!! What is it with these people, when I'm on holiday I like to enjoy a bit of a lie in I get up early enough when I'm at work!!

This was our second visit to Playa Del Carmen, we stayed in the Reef Coco Beach last year and had a great holiday but the Riu Yucatan is in a higher class to the Coco Beach in my opinion. The layout of the public areas is perfect with the theatre being near the main outside bars and terrace by the pools which meant you could experience the atmosphere in the evenings even if you didn't fancy the show that was on that night. The rooms were spacious, comfortable and spotlessly clean. The maid frequently left flowers and animals mades out of towels in the room which were always appreciated. The pools were lovely and it was great that the games were in a seperate pool so that if you fancied a dip you weren't restricted by the activities. The beach was idyllic. We are not big beach people, preferring the pool normally but this beach is not to be missed and we ended up splitting our time between the pool and beach. The entertainment was good. The animation team tried to get you involved but did not force you if they saw you preferred to watch. The dancing in the shows was superb but I was a bit disappointed by the miming to the songs. Food in the buffet restauraunt was first class. We only tried the Asian out of the Speciality restauraunts and were a bit disappointed as we preferred the buffet, but everyone's different! The making of this hotel is the staff, every member of staff (from the gardeners to Management) you encounter always smiled and said Hola. The staff are very good at establishing if you are up for a bit of fun or whether you prefer to be left alone. A smile is so easy to do but makes the world of difference. The management team have got this so right! The hotel is spotless and the grounds and buildings are all pristine as are the staff. If I have any criticism it is the lack of enforcement of the pool rules. Despite the notices people still reserved beds and used balls and inflatables in the pools (this may seem petty but the pools are not really big enough for these). We left it 3 days before bowing to defeat and having to go to the pool at 7.30 to reserve beds under an umberella. On the whole this was an idylic holiday. The fact we have never spent so much time within a holiday complex before speaks for itself. I thoroughly recomend this hotel", "Date": "September 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Yucatan\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3841654", "Content": "We found the reviews on this site so helpful before booking our holiday so we thought we'd share our opinion too. We booked our holiday through Thomson. POSITIVES The staff are fabulous, friendly, efficient and professional. The hotel was constantly spotlessly clean and repairs and maintenance were taken care of immediately. The position on the beach is great with lots of activities and shade if you want it. The buffet food was wonderful, a really good selection. The monkeys living around the hotel were great entertainment, it was a real treat to see them. The rooms were great, spotless and air conditioned with fridges full of water and bottled drinks. Overall, we had a fantastic holiday and are booking again for next year! NEGATIVES The poolside was very busy and to get a spot with some shade you needed to play other guests at their own game and put a towel on a bed before going to breakfast. We didn't like doing this and the hotel policy is that guests cannot reserve sunbeds but the policy wasn't enforced. This did cause some friction between guests. It was quite noisy at night (some guests did try to recoup the cost of their holiday in alcohol), although hotel security quickly dealt with noise nuisances. The pool was full of kids and it was difficult to find a quiet spot without being hit by a ball or inflatable. The buffet restaurant got very busy at about 8pm and we were dodging people with plates full of food. I think most of the gripes stemmed from the fact that we were on holiday in high season (as teachers we don't get a choice) but we went out into Playa del Carmen for a few quiet meals because we often felt bombarded by children. The red wine in the hotel tasted like paint stripper. ADVICE Get a taxi into Playa del Carmen ($5 for a 10 min drive). There are loads of lovely shops and restaurants with all kinds of great food. It's a shame to miss by staying in the hotel. Thomson tours were VERY expensive. We booked with an operator in Playa del Carmen, a tour to Chichen Itza for half the price of the Thomson tour. We paid $45 each, Thomson wanted $99 each. But we did exactly the same tour, practically following the Thomson bus! The tour to Isla Mujeres offered by Thomson was poor value. We did the tour ourself by catching the very comfortable air-conditioned coach into Cancun, then a bus to the port and the catamaran to the island for half the price Thomson were asking. Rent a golf buggy to get around this island (it's great fun and only a small island). The bus into Cancun is about $6 return and is comfortable and reliable. Take plenty of good mosquito repellent (Mosiguard didn't work for us). You need something containing the active ingredient DEET. Sainsbury's do an extra strength aerosol of insect repellent in a yellow can. This smelt vile but was the most effective. Take 3 or 4 cans with you per couple. The ruins at Tulum are very exposed and there is little shade. You will need a sun hat and a bottle of water at the least. Don't take young children on this one, they found it unbearably hot, although there is a beach to cool off on the other side of the cliff. Small tips are greatly appreciated by the staff, they work incredibly hard.

We had a wonderful time. The food is plentiful and great. There are a lot of choices. We stayed in Punta Cana and the food there was tasteless. Food at the Riu is like eating at a good restaurant. The a la carte restaurant food is wonderful. We didn't have any problem with sitting. Dinner at the buffet starts at 7PM just like the a la carte. Lunch runs from 12:00 to 4:00PM. There's always food. My daughter enjoyed the Kids Club. King is in charge. He normally has a dance show that he practice with the kids. The entertainment team does a great job. The shows are great and funny. Lots of audience participation. The animation team keeps everyone entertained during the day. I was worried about the topless situation. I spoke to both of my children before the trip. My children were pretty good at ignoring the women that were topless. We meet some wonderful people. The staff are friendly, accommodating and will go out of their way to help you. On our first day we were given a suite and I told the staff that I wanted a room near the pool and they accommodated me the next day. I was celebrating my 40th birthday and during dinner the staff sang a beautiful birthday song. The only dilemma I ran into was the fact that I had to wake up before 7AM to claim my spot at the pool. I brought my own towels so that I can place them on the chairs. The beach seemed to be crowded almost everyday. Riu Tequila does not have a beach so the people share the beach with Yucatan. It was nice that you can enjoy Riu Tequila and Riu Playacar grounds, drinks, breakfast and lunch. Overall we had a wonderful time. My children did not want to come home.

The range of food was monumentus never have I seen such a range. Most of the drinks were international brands and the staff did not skimp on measures, the shows rotated around the three Rius in the area and were great. Being able to use the facilities at the Riu Tequila and Riu Playacar meant a change of schene without paying for it which was good as the drinks in Playa Del Carmen were very expensive.

We just returned from a vacation at the Riu Yucatan July 11-18th. My husband and I took our two sons who are 4 & 7. The beach there was beautiful. Some days the water was clearer and calmer and others it was rough but Hurricane Emily was on it's way. The Yucatan definately had the best beach in the Playacar area. The pools were very nice too both with awesome swimup bars that didn't take long to get a drink at. One was deeper than the other and one a a tiny shallow section for small children. There was a big jacuzzi in the middle that was nice and another bubbly section over at one of the swim up bars. That swim up bar was really neat because it was by itself just a bar in the water with tables and seating sections. The drinks were really good too. I'd have to recommend the pina coladas. There were two other bars outside by the pools and the entertainment area that were hopping at night. There was a bar in the lobby that was always busy. Roger was the greatest bartender. They had nightly shows at either the hotel or a short walk over to the Tequila. All the shows we saw were very entertaining but we missed a lot because they didn't start until 10 pm when my kids were ready to go to bed. They had a mini kids club in a small playground area that was only open from 10:30 am -12:30 pm and from 3:00 pm-5:00 pm. They'd play on the playground and play soccer, play with clay, draw, and they'd go over to the shallow pools and play water volleyball. At 8 pm every night they'd have what they called a mini disco on the stage for the kids where they'd all get up on stage and dance and play games. The kids enjoyed that. On the beach, they had a stand where you could go get boogie boards and other water sports equipment for free. If you have teenagers or you want to party, I warn you that this is not a really active resort. It is more laid back and relaxing. The Tequila was a lot more active plus they had the disco, but it 's beach is across the street a long walk and I wouldn't like that. Plus, it wasn't as nice as the Yucatan. As for dining, we only ate at the buffets. You had to get up way too early and go down to the entrance to the buffet to make reservations to the specialty restaurants. Plus, these restaurants only offered a very limited menu and I had small picky children with me. We thought the buffets were great. They always had a good variety and all four of us found something to appease our taste buds. Always had pizza and french fries and they even had bottles of delmonte ketchup which was a real plus for ketchup loving kids. I had some of the best ice cream there that I have ever had. The rooms were nice but small. We never had any problems with anything working. There was a mini fridge in the room they kept well stocked with bottles of Pepsi, orange soda, bottled water, corona and club soda. And there was a built in liquor dispenser that had tequila, vodka, rum and something else that we never used. There's not much selection for television viewing, but hey, you aren't on vacation to watch tv. There is a small gift shop in the hotel but it is very expensive. If you want a raft, I recommend you bringing your own because it is $20 us for a blow up raft or ring. You can always get one of the free boogy boards down at the beach to float around on down at the ocean. There was also a specialty clothing store there that had everything black and white. They had some cute things but I never saw anyone buy anything there. Out in front of the drive to the hotel is Mexican street where there are a couple of shops and a salon where you can get your hair braided and get a massage. We did neither so I cannot comment. If you walk out to the main road and a short distance down the road past the Tequila, you will find a shopping center with about anything you want to buy and also a pharmacy. We took a cab into Playa del Carmen and walked around and shopped there on 5th avenue. It is a really neat little town that still retains some mexican culture without being too touristy. One tip, don't buy at the first place you stop. There's always the same thing cheaper somewhere else down the street. We ate at Senior Frogs one night and had a blast. My kids did their first shots of Shirley Temple's which was cute. They have a whole ordeal they went through. They had a balloon guy who made my kids a power ranger and ninja turtle and he was very talented. The kids loved that. We got our pictures taken with the sombreros on. It was well worth the money I spent there because senior frogs was one of our favorite times spent on vacation. They ferry to Cozumel is right off fifth avenue by Senior frogs. It was $34 for all 4 of us each way on a large air conditioned boat that took about 30 minutes. There are two different companies and we tried both and they are really about the same so it doesn't matter which one you take. In Cozumel we had planned to just go to one of the parks to snorkel but we were approached by a lovely salesman named Omar on the boat who convinced us to go with his company on the glass bottomed boat out to snorkel. I was afraid to do a tour like that because I wasn't sure the kids would even get into the water. but Omar promised me they'd be taken care of so I gave in. It was only $75 for all four of us to go out on a glass bottomed boat that held 10 people. You could see the bottom of the ocean really well through the bottom. The kids loved that. They took us out to 3 different spots to snorkel that were great. The guide pulled my 7 year old in the water holding a life saver ring so he didn't have to swim and we didn't have to pull him and my 4 year old didn't want to go out so the Captain took good care of him while we snorkeled. There were cokes, water and Corona free on the boat. It was well worth the money we paid for the trip. If you want to try Omar's company and don't catch him on the ferry, His stand is the last umbrella on the pier as you are walking off the ferry into Cozumel. There are other companies with nicer looking boats but I don't know what experience they provide. We ate at the Hard Rock Cafe there because it was right across from the pier. The smallest Hard Rock in the world. It was good to have some food that tasted like home. The night before we were scheduled to fly home, Hurricane Emily came creeping in. They closed the beach down first, then made everyone leave the pool area. Only the buffet was open for dinner. Then everyone off to their rooms. All around the area they were boarding up stuff and tying off the chandeliers and stuff. It was crazy. They told us to but our mattresses up by the sliding glass doors to protect up from glass. We put the box springs up by the doors, had the kids in the closet to sleep, put a mattress down in the floor of the bathroom for us to sleep on and put the other mattress up at the entrance to the bathroom to protect us. We are from Tornado alley so we are used to this sort of stuff. They brought around bags of sandwiches and plenty of drinks so we wouldn't starve. We went to sleep and the Hurricane hit during the night and we slept right through it all. The buildings are made of concrete so you really couldn't hear anything going on. The next morning we awoke to a disaster. No glass broke in our room or water got in, but there was vegetation down everywhere. The lobby had about 2 inches of water standing. The pools were filled with brown stuff and we didn't even see what happened to the beach. They were already cleaning up when we woke up. People there are always cleaning. The airports were shut down, so we didn't get to fly home. We had booked with worry free vacations and kept trying to reach our representative but just kept getting an answering machine. They were supposed to pick us up at 6:30 that morning to take us to the airport but didn't show up. We didn't know what to do. There were so many trees down in town there was no traffice for a long time so you couldn't take a cab anywhere. They let us stay in our room at the hotel without additional charge until about 3 pm and then we were going to have to pay an additional $150 if we wanted to stay after that. By that time, traffic was moving again but we still couldn't get ahold of our rep. There was a group of people like us in the lobby all trying to decide what to do. We finally found a van that took about 12 of us to the airport for bout $100 for all of us. Our terminal was closed so we went to the main terminal and hung out for a few hour with all our luggage, still not knowing what to do. We finally found a worry free rep at the airport who took us to this dive type motel close to the airport for the night for an additional $60. It wasn't the Hilton but it was clean and better than the airport. The people from Worry Free were supposed to come pick us up to take us to the airport the next morning at 7:30 but by 8:30 when they still hadn't showed up, we spent another $15 for a cab to the airport where we finally found out where were booked on a flight leaving that morning which went well and we got home safely. i was very disappointed with worry free vacations. Before we got on our flight, I talked with one of the worry free guys about our problems with them and I said, Not very worry free. All he had to say was, not worry free yesterday, today or ever. What a jerk!!! Even though the vacation ended on a sour note, the rest of the time was wonderful and it was still worth every penny we spent!!!", "Date": "July 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cVery nice experience for the price you pay. Before & After Emily\u201d", "Author": "Nightshade", "ReviewID": "UR3691629", "Content": "Hello everyone: I'll try to point out things which I discovered only when I arrived to the hotel (either nobody wrote about this before or I simply didn't see reviews with the following info): ***LOCATION OF THE BUILDINGS: Buildings 4, 5 & 6 are located very close to the beach A.K.A Playa. To be specific, building # 5 faces a new pool, building # 6 faces a bar salon \"El Tempo\", building #4 faces a restaurant. Buildings 1, 2 and 3 are right behind 4, 5 & 6. Buildings 7, 8 and 9 are the furthest buildings from the beach and located behind a main hall - reception area. There are 2 tennis courts in front of bld #7 (behind bld #1) - info for tennis fanciers :) There are only 3 floors in each building and your key says in which building and on which floor your room is located. E.G if your room number is 5123 - it means that your room is in a building #5 on the first floor; if you room number is 2309 - your room is in a building #2 on the third floor. Basically, as soon as you know your assigned room number, you don't have to torture people on a reception desk trying to find out all additional info. Hopefully, you can email Riu Yucatan and ask them if they can give you a room in a specific building (never hurts ) and avoid our experience of moving from one room to another after a long flight (were given a room in a bld #9 1st floor, moved to bld #5 2d floor) AMENITIES ***INTERNET ACCESS - $3 per 20 minutes (cannot break it, has to use 20 minutes at once). There are approximately 10 computers in a room. BEACH TOWELS \u2013 only one per person; Riu Yucatan issues you a plastic card per person, which you give away every time you take a fresh towel. There is a charge of $20 for every lost card, please be careful. A towel booth opens at 8AM, so if you want to take a swim in the ocean earlier, either bring your own from home or take a fresh one with you the previous evening before the booth closes (at 6PM). ***OTHER RIU HOTELS \u2013 You can use all amenities of Riu Playacar & Riu Tequila Hotels, but cannot go to Riu Palace unless you ask for a visitor pass, which states that you cannot eat there. ***ROOM TOWELS \u2013 terrible \u2013 worn out and rough! Please take your own - at least a face towel. Maybe it happened because Riu Yucatan just opened their renovated hotel 4 days before we arrived, and during the renovation they stored all room towels in some basement, but all towels smelled funny! Also, after the hurricane Emily a lot of people were using those towels to sweep floors in a room. I hope Riu Yucatan will replace all of them. ***MESSAGING SERVICE \u2013 non existent. Unfortunately, I\u2019m not kidding. My husband left me 5 messages via front desk + my friends used Riu online messaging service and I received n o n e! Maybe it happened due to turmoil before the hurricane Emily, but this kind of service is unacceptable for me. If Riu didn\u2019t bother to install phones with a voice message function, they should\u2019ve instructed their workers to be more responsible and not ignore messages left for their guests via front desk. I hope there will be no emergency calls from your relatives/friends when you\u2019re on vacation, otherwise you\u2019ll stay clueless until you arrive home. ***FRONT DESK EMPLOYEES \u2013 very nice people trying to please you, some of them speak several languages, some barely speak English, but in general you can always find a person who will help to resolve your problem. There was only one negative experience \u2013 with a female employee Alex. She likes to postpone things and keeps telling with a big smile on her face \u201cplease wait 15 minutes\u201d, in 15 minutes she says \u201cplease wait a little bit more\u201d and then \u201canother 15 minutes\u201d. Basically, until you push her, she won\u2019t even start looking for a solution. Carlos was the most helpful employee there \u2013 a pleasant guy. FOOD \u2013 Just OK for me, mostly I ate vegetables and fruits, but what do you expect paying $750 per person for a week? Yeah, eating well is fun, and we should indulge ourselves in excellent foods, but not 7 days in a row. I\u2019ve stayed at Royal Hideaway in Mexico this spring and I could barely breathe after each meal there \u2013 not fun. It\u2019s so hard to stop yourself when food is too good :) Btw there are 3 additional restaurants at Riu Yucatan (Asian, Italian & Mediterranean). In order to get there, you have to make a reservation at the main restaurant a la buffet \u2013 \u201cLa Hacienda\u201d before or after your breakfast. We had dinner at Asian place. Don\u2019t expect to get amazing dining experience though \u2013 it\u2019s also a buffet style restaurant\u2013 serve yourself. ***BEACH \u2013 pretty crowded but you always can find a spot there, especially if you wake up before 9AM. Our Beach chairs are dark green, next to us is Riu Tequila\u2019s beach with bright green chairs and next to Riu Tequila\u2019s beach is Riu Palace with blue chairs. ***POOL \u2013 didn\u2019t use it \u2013 hate chlorine. Pool is large but seemed very crowded to me with all adults drinking at the pool bar and children running around and constantly screaming. I guess it\u2019s easier for parents to control their children at the pool then on a beach. ***HURRICANE EMILY: Yes, we stayed at the hotel during Emily, and nobody tried to evacuate us. Guys, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s not Ritz Carlton who informed their guests about the hurricane 5 days before it hit Mexico. Furthermore, the day before the hurricane, Riu stuff quietly removed all Scuba Caribe boats and put tiny pieces of paper with info about upcoming hurricane on a front desk counter. Tell me how often on your vacation you go to a front desk just to check if something interesting is happening. Yeah, right \u2013 not that often. I found out about the hurricane at 10PM on July 16, 2005 from my husband who was trying unsuccessfully to catch us in a room for the last 2 days. By that time it was already too late to change a plane ticket \u2013 Cancun airport was a mess, everybody was trying to escape from Mexico. We stayed in our room during the hurricane, taped our windows, blocked it with a mattress and a dresser, as Riu instructed us on July 17th. At ~ 2:30 AM my mom woke me up because our room was flooded. Next morning we saw what Emily had done to our hotel \u2013 an absolutely saddening picture. I won\u2019t post photos, which were made after the hurricane, except only one, because it\u2019s not fair to Riu Company. They quickly tried to clean everything around and return our hotel to normal operation. On July 19th, Riu already opened a buffet and filled the pool with water. Riu Yucatan buildings didn\u2019t sustain any noticeable damage and I don\u2019t think the hotel will close for a renovation. That\u2019s pretty much it; I think I covered everything I wanted. N.B! Oh, Mosquitoes! Almost forgot about these annoying creatures which seem to be everywhere. If you don\u2019t want to have huge red dots all over your body and itch like crazy, please take mosquito repellent.

I have travelled all over the world and stayed at the very best hotels and some of the natiest so I feel I can be objective for this one. We booked through worryfreevacations and as a result had a free shuttle ride to and from the airport. This was nice since I had stayed in a condo in playa last year and the cab ride was $40. Anyway, we got in at 5am but the shuttle was there and the Yucatan checked us in immediately even though check in was not until 3pm. Our room was good and completely functional. We had a stocked fridge and also 4 liquor bottles to make drinks in our room. I saw some review complain about not getting a blender. Are you kidding me? I will say the bed was harder than I like but I slept fine and we were able to share one bed comfortably even though they put 2 together. I would suggest you bring deet with you as we did get a few mosquito bites when we slept. Noise was never an issue for us and neither was getting a beach chair or a drink. I also never felt worried about anything happening to our stuff. The beach was beautiful and the water was great. It was so nice to walk 150 ft from our room and be on a beach. The staff all speak at least basic english (which is better than I can say for those who complain about language issues when they don't bother to learn any spanish) so it was easy to make requests or get questions answered. They were all more than willing to help. The whole towel card thing was no issue either, just remember not to lose them. The food was good, though mostly American and only some mexican food. (We went into town for dinner twice just because the food in town is good and not very expensive.) We were surprised to learn that they were closing for renovations the day we were leaving but they let us use the sister properties and also arranged for us to catch a shuttle from the sister hotel even though our flight was at 8pm.

First the disappointments: small pool, hard bed, lots of bug bites, loud monkeys, pre-arranged dinner seating, dirty beach towels and keeping track of them or you owe $20 each. I also didn't like the arrangement of the beds. They stick two double beds together instead of a king. My husband and I slept separately. They only have a curtain separating the shower area from the bedroom. They give you only 2 one inch square soaps for your stay. The bedspreads are very thin and unlike anything I have seen.

After reading many reviews over a six month period, I didn't know what to think and were convinced that there were two different resorts since other reviews were so contrasted. I'm convinced it's all a matter of personal expectations. This was our first trip to Mexico and to an all inclusive place. We found the Yucatan to be a very beautiful, safe and relaxing place and had a super time. I looked at every website and slide show of the resort, so I was not at all surprised by the small size of the rooms or pool when I arrived. What you see is what you get. (They are currently closing for three months to renovate, and from what we heard....\"not a thing will be left untouched\". If you are expecting the comforts and cousine of the United States or your home country, then stay there! You have to come to grips that you are in a different country and the food and culture is different and not what we are used to. I'm from the U.S. and firmly believe if you live here you should speak English, but when in Mexico, I felt embarassed and rude that I couldn't speak a word of Spanish. Before you go, be courteous and learn the basics so you don't feel ignorant like I did not knowing what to reply when someone wishes you good evening. NOT ONE employee will pass you without saying HOLA! The Beach was the most beautiful I've ever seen and the Yucatan definitely had the best one. Playacar and Iberostar were eroded and it was devastating to see what the storms did to them. Take a beach blanket if you don't wake up at 6:00 a.m. to save a chair. There is lots of room. I didn't expect to find one, but we found chairs every day by 11:00 a.m. when we finally got there. I didn't expect drink service at the beach and there is none, but bar is a short walk away. The grounds are very beautiful in a tropical setting (Constantly being groomed) with cute monkeys and \"piggy things\" and very few cats. The distance between the rooms, (we were in building #5) pool, lobby, restaurants and beach are nice and close to eachother which helped us feel safe if our children forgot something and wanted to go get it themselves. I walked around the Iberostar next door and it was beautiful, but it took me literally 10 minutes to get to the lobby from the pool. Ladies, do yourself a favor and don't wear any heeled shoes or sandals because they get stuck in the stamped concrete paths which ruin your shoes. Pool: Nice, but small. They are \"blowing it up\" to make it bigger. Would have been nice to have music piped in like the Playacar. Rooms: Small, Tired furnishings, but not surprised after reading the reviews and seeing the pictures. Musty smell, but not gross. Take a plug-in air freshener, it really helps. Beds are hard but we all slept fine. Take insect repellant as our room was on the ground floor had lots of misquitoes. Mini-bar was stocked with 4 bottles of liquor, one Jose Cuervo. The refigerator had two bottles of Pepsi, 7-Up, Fanta, soda water and 4 bottled Coronas, as well as two to three huge bottles of water. We left $3 to $5 daily and did receive extra water and towels. Be advised the person who cleans your room is not necessarily the person who restocks your bar, so you might think of literally leaving a tip IN THE REFRIGERATOR so that person is sure to get it. Now for the food: Every meal is a buffet, except for two dinner places which are very hard to get a reservation at. Most of the food is prepared fresh right before you, which was nice. (They need a new exhaust/vent system, though, as you left the dining room smelling like fried food. I am a very picky eater and so are my children, so we weren't thrilled with the cuisine. My husband who eats anything, loved all of the food. If you are expecting food like back home, you will be disappointed. There is no Heinz ketsup, Kraft mac-n-cheese, Dominos pizza or TGIF burgers. Even the fountain Pepsi tasted different. (French fries were close to McDonalds). Again, you're in a different country - what are YOU expecting??? Breakfast was the best: 7 juices, pancakes, french toast, donuts, omelets, eggs, crepes, bagels, breads, every kind of cereal; Lunch: Fresh Pizzas, burgers, tacos, french fries, fruit, salads soft serve ice cream. Dinner: Different main entree every night plus fresh pizzas, soups were great, french fries, steaks, fish, salads, desserts, hard ice cream, capuccinno and lattes. We were with 40 people and no one got sick at all. Drinks: I thought the drinks were awesome and was pleasantly surprised to find the name brands: Jose Cuervo, Bacardi, Smirnoff, Canadian Club, Baileys, Kaluha and Jim Beam. Take your own insulated mugs with lids. The bartenders fill them no matter how big they are with a smile and they keep the sand out. I drank lots of frozen drinks which did have fresh fruit in them: banana mommas and miami vice were the best! The bartenders and staff were the hardest working people I've ever seen. They put in very long days and put up with lots of drunk, rude people (including obnoxious, drunk teens) and do it all with a smile day after day. I've never come across such an appreciative and accomodating staff anywhere filled with people who truly love their job of serving others. Attitudes don't exist here. We never, ever waited for a drink and they treated my children (who didn't tip them) with the same quick and smiley service as the adults. The entertainment was great! The Animacion team is teriffic! The Michael Jackson, Hollywood and around the World show was the best, although we were sorry to miss Grease. The Dancers were incredible!!! Roaming to Playacar and Tequila is a great feature of this location because you're not just stuck in one place. If you don't like the show at your resort that night, you can take a quick walk somewhere else. In closing, this is truly a beautiful location and resort that is getting the updating it needs. We got what we expected and more. We were told the staff is staying on, which is a huge bonus.

I\u2019m happy to say that our stay here reinforced our already positive view of the Riu chain for if anything, our experience here was even better \u2013 and I gave the Riu Jalisco five stars in my previous rating. On to specifics: Setting. The entire resort is modelled after an old style Spanish hacienda. This is nowhere more obvious than in the main lobby, which features an enormous open area, the main restaurant, a disco, a few shops and a bar. The resort has nine three level buildings \u2013 also in a hacienda style and note: no elevators. I appreciated the low rise buildings over the high rise resort hotels that have always been our experience. Buildings are separated from other buildings by green space \u2013 ranging from manicured gardens and lawns with shrubs and trees to \u2018jungle\u2019. Green spaces are inhabited by various forms of wildlife, including everyone\u2019s favourite, the howler monkey (and they call them that for a reason!) None of the rooms at this hotel are \u201cocean front\u201d. We faced another building but it was a good distance away and separated by an expanse of \u201cjungle\u201d. Our building was perfectly situated in that it was close to the beach/pool. Buildings 7 through 9 are much further away so from the beach you might like to avoid those if you don\u2019t like a long walk. I should also mention that resort was quite close to the \u2018Playacar\u2019 shopping centre with some interesting (but relatively expensive) stores. A nice walk after supper. Playa del Carmen itself is not far away though you have to take a cab ( 40 pesos). You will be pestered by time share guys and store owners, particularly around the cozumel ferry dock. On the other hand, there is plenty of choice, and prices are lower than the hotels or the Playacar shopping centre. I understand from other posters that the hotel will be shutting down for maintenance in April. To be honest, there are some things here and there \u2013 nothing major \u2013 where a little sprucing up would be welcome. Room. Our suite (4201) consisted of a bedroom area and a sitting area, connected by an open doorway with a thick curtain. The extra space we found useful so that family members don\u2019t trip over each other when in the room. With this combination you get a bathtub rather than a shower stall, a very long balcony (but an outside light would have been nice), extra windows and a second TV (as if you\u2019d spend any time actually watching it). Extra space was well worth the extra money in our view. Do bring an alarm clock for there is none in the room. We didn\u2019t have a problem the one time we used the hotel wake up service but others reported different. As others have reported, beds are hard, but you got used to that after the first night. Some also report a problem with the musty smell but that to my experience is a tropical \u201cgiven\u201d and I honestly can say I didn\u2019t notice it after the first day. I have no complaints about the housekeeping or the minibar service. A special request to fill the minibar was handled promptly. Every day \u201cNelson\u201d the housekeeper would create animals out of towels which the kids loved and he was always friendly whenever we saw him. Food. I note some reviewers say there is no choice in La Hacienda restaurant for dinners. That\u2019s certainly true if all you want is pizza, hot dogs, or French fries. For us, every night the buffet featured choice. Seafood paella, turkey, lamb, pork, seafood with different vegetables and salads. Don\u2019t overlook food prepared out on the terrace as well! There are two supper \u201csittings\u201d (6:30 \u2013 8:00 and 8:30 \u2013 10:00) and you will be assigned a table for your choice of time for the duration of your stay. We found that if you arrived at the beginning of your sitting \u201cwindow\u201d, say, 6:30 pm, there\u2019d be 5 minute line-ups for hot food. If you arrive, say, at 7:00 pm, you\u2019ll breeze right through. Lunch and breakfast are less formal and you can arrive when you want and sit where you want. Of course you can use facilities of neighbouring riu resorts (but not the riu palace) for lunch if you want as well. Breakfast was fine. We ate lunch at the beach everyday and that was fine too. There are also two speciality restaurants, a \u201cMediterranean\u201d and a \u201csteakhouse\u201d, also with two sittings though at 7:00 to 8:30 pm and 9:00 to 10:30 . No problem whatever getting a reservation for any restaurant/sitting combo. We did not try the Mediterranean but the Steakhouse was good \u2013 though you may wish to request your meat be cooked a little more than at home (i.e, if you like \u2018medium\u2019, request \u2018medium well\u2019). Beach/pool. As others have noted, the pool is on the small side. We never used it other than later in the afternoon. However, it wasn\u2019t usually very crowded, and you could always get a seat at the poolside bar. You can use the pool at the Riu Tequila which seems to be much larger though we never did that. The pool also is quite heavily shaded especially later in the afternoon, when the nearby buildings cast a shadow. The beach is quite wonderful. Wide and sandy with big waves that kids loved. No problems getting water sport items though some days it was too rough to take them out. Frankly, the beach is the reason why we chose this resort over the Riu Tequila which though slightly better rated, has no beachfront. Note also that there is SIGNIFICANT beach erosion starting at the Riu Playacar which worsens as you go north from there. Sandbags all over the place \u2013 not a pretty sight! I believe that that this leads to guests at riu playacar using the facilities at the Yucatan \u2013 which they are entitled to do. With the people from the other two Riu hotels competing for beach chairs, you may find some difficulty getting lounge chairs if you arrive after 10 am. For this reason also, you may find that space at the beachfront restaurant \u2018La Margarita\u2019 at a premium at 1 pm \u2013 the choice there being much more than the adjoining \u201cBeach Club\u201d restaurant which technically is part of the Riu Tequila. For those that care, a few women go topless \u2013 no more than 5% of those there, and most of those only when sunbathing. Only a problem if you are the type who got upset about the Janet Jackson \u2018wardrobe malfunction\u2019 thing. Staff. Always very friendly. Remember that these people are not your servants and that they deserve respect and courtesy as much as you do. Try using your Spanish too! Entertainment. A pleasant surprise. Not as amateur hour as I was led to believe from some of the reviews here. The magician on Monday was top notch. Use of professional artists for shows was appreciated (as opposed to the staff clowning around a lot). They do go a little overboard with the audience participation bit. As with other riu resorts, entertainment starts quite late at 9:45. Though not part of the hotel experience, I should mention that we took a trip to Xcaret during our stay. Highly recommended. Xcaret bills itself as an eco-archeological theme park and is an alternative to the Xel-Ha/Tulum excursion. Though the underground river and the evening show alone are worth the price of admission, there is more than that, more than you could even do in one day, with some very nice restaurants to boot. We were told you should avoid this place on Tuesdays and Thursdays however because cruise ship passengers are there in droves. I do not understand some of the negative reviews in this space \u2013 these seem to either magnify trivial problems into major issues, or else describe a place I hardly recognize. Both are difficult to accept. We have nothing but good things to say about the Riu Yucatan. Ours was a very pleasant experience. I found myself wishing I could have stayed a few extra days. We might even break with our normal practice of staying at different resort areas and come here again in the near future.", "Date": "March 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central IL", "Title": "\u201cFrequent Guest\u201d", "Author": "Imrocky1", "ReviewID": "UR3292172", "Content": "We just returned from our 4th trip in 4 years to the Riu Yucatan and found it to be as great this time as it was in our previous 3 trips. I'm not sure what resort the previous reviewer was writing about, it doesn't even sound like the Riu Yucatan. The beach is still beautiful although last year's hurricane might have left the beach a little narrower, if you've never been there you won't even notice it. The grounds are still well maintained and the monkeys continue to mulitply and entertain the guests. The staff is always friendly and attentive. The only complaint I have with the staff is that they didn't seem to bring coffee to your table in the mornings on a regular basis, but they have a couple cappuccino/espresso machines now that most guests were using. The food for the most part is very good, sure there are some dishes that are a little bland and there are hot dogs and hamburgers for the kids but they are trying to find something to appeal to all different tastes which I think they do a great job of. They had several days of special lunches during our stay that included a grill set up on the beach cooking chicken, burgers, etc. Another day it was tacos and another day tostados. The evening buffet always includes a huge variety of dishes and some typical Mexican cuisine. Dining at the speciality restaurants is always a treat as they do their best to pamper you and finish the evening with a flaming Baked Alaskan display with the lights turned down. My only complaint with the food line is how rude some people can be as they cut in front of you in line and that is not the fault of the Riu staff. The rooms were clean with fun towel animals left for us. Our clothes were even picked up, neatly folded and placed on our chairs or suitcases. The beds are firm but many people prefer a firm matress, I found myself so tired in the evening that it really didn't matter. The Animacion team does a great job of trying to entertain the guests that want to be entertained and leaving alone those who prefer to be left alone. The evening entertainment is pretty much the same shows that they have been doing for the past 4 years so we didn't bother to go watch them this time but they are fun if you've never seen them before. The Riu Yucatan is closing in April for 2-3 months for remodeling. With so many guests enjoying the resort over the past several years the resort is indeed showing a little wear and I'm sure a facelift is in order, I look forward to returning again to see the renovations and as I'm sure the Riu will maintain their high standards, I expect the changes will be for the best.", "Date": "March 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwich, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed with Yucatan\u201d", "Author": "lovebug", "ReviewID": "UR3288608", "Content": "We arrived back last week after 2 weeks in Mexico.

The beach was heavily shaded with trees too. If you weren't able to reserve your sun bed by the pool by 7 am then forget it. This was intolerable especially when beds stayed empty. Our beach was also used by 2 other sister hotels so got very busy. The dress code of long trousers was not enforced. The steakhouse speciality restaurant was terrible.

We had to have the shower head replaced on arrival and I did get an electric shock from the standard lamp but both were rectified immediately on reporting them to reception.

The resort clean, tropical, decor was tired, rooms musty, and the worst was we could never get the odour out of the bathroom (sometimes strong and sometimes not). Broken shower head held together with a rusty screw. If you were not carefull the shower head would spin around and shoot out of the shower. TV, I know you don't go away to watch the tube but if you have them in the room shouldn't it work. Whoops sorry it did work you just couldn't make out the picture I like the late night news! not the weather report showing snow all the time. Bed's hard, sheets clean, bedspreads well...... Room service great always clean and tidy. Bar drinks.. well I couldn't tell the difference from one to another, fruit punch with rum I think is the base for all their drinks. Speaking of rum you have to wonder about rum named \"Home Rum\"? Preimium liquor? Bar tenders great!, no shortage of service. To bad they don't have decent drinks to serve. Best advice drink black russians. Food well.... Boring, monotonous, bland, and choices minimal. If you like to line up like cattle MOOOOOO. its the place. The staff in this area are to few and far between. The thing that bugged me the most was the recycled table cloths. I get great pleasure out of knowing what the last guest had for dinner or breakfast. Tables lined up like a feeding trough Mooooooo. Whats with this assigned seating at dinner is it to create the live stock shuffle. What a dumb idea, if its so good for dinner why not breakfast? Moooooo again! Specialty restaurant, whats the specialty? Shouldn't a sea food restaurant have all kinds sea food not 50 ways to grill your flounder? Ok there are good things, the beach great. The monkeys great, especially the old guy who howled every morning at 5:00 Am with out him we would never have got a lounger at the pool. you have to get up at that time to claim a lounger. Advice bring a couple of your own old towels you will get no argument with claim jumpers. Entertainment well... cheese cheese cheese. Fire the entertainment director. Riu this guy or girl has know idea. ( watching people fight for a lounger is more entertaining.) Enough already close the place down( they are doing that end of April,) refurbish all the rooms, including the wood missing from numerous entrance doors. Hire more staff. buy real fruit for the drinks and splurge on a good rum. Check all the washroom vents, fix up the showers, hire a skilled entertainment director, get rid of the cattle call dinners and work on the dining.

First the good points, of which there were several. The staff was great! Except for one minor incident, we found everyone to be very helpful and very friendly. Yes, the beds are hard, but we found them to be very comfortable and always had a good night's sleep. The rooms are basic, but always very clean. A/C is adequate. Plenty of hot water with great pressure in the shower. Bware, the howler monkeys will wake you bright and early!! The beach is very nice with only minor erosion. If you head toward the Palace you will see way more erosion, therefore very little beach. No beach bar or beach service, but only a short walk to pool bar. The grounds are nice with maintenance going on all the time. Now for the one negative, and for us it was huge. The food is terrible. If you have a passion for food at all, DO NOT stay at this hotel. Breakfast was good, a lot of choices, pretty tasty. Great fresh fruits and juices. But, lunch and dinner were unbelievably bad. We ended up eating out for lunch and dinner for the last few days of our vacation. Most of the entree choices were either dried out or very fatty with very little flavor at the buffet. We went to the steak house the 2nd night. Don't bother. I ordered what I hoped would be a juicy ribeye, med. rare. I timed how long it took chew a piece, believe me, you don't want to know!! What really surprised me was the lack of Mexican choices. The buffet had tacos, but the meat was cold and dried out. Beyond that, nothing!! We did find some great local restaurants with help of the staff, go figure. So much for all inclusive!!! If food is not your thing you will be okay here. If it is, I strongly recommend NOT doing all - inclusive It was our 1st and last one. There are great restaurants in town where you get to experience real Mexican cuisine.

Had a great time during what was our first visit to mexico. To summarise:- LOCATION. Best in Playacar, on a lovely sandy beach with plenty of palm trees for shade. urther north towards Playa Del Carmen, they were having trouble with Erosion and a lot of sandbaging was evident. No such problems at the Yucatan though even with a small drop from the beach to the sea. GROUNDS Lovely setting with mature gardens hiding the apartment blocks which, at 3 floors high, did not stand out anyway. Painted in a decent colour, they didn't stand out like the ones at the Riu Playacar for example which were painted in baby blue, lime green etc. Small rodent like creatures roamed the grounds (cross beteween rat/squirrel/guinea pig and the size of a small rabbitt), along with a few cats and a group of monkeys which made a horrendous noise but were seen most days while we were there. FOOD. Good variety. 2 sittings at dinner (6.30pm or 8.30pm) which was quite regimented and made for a scrum and long queue sometimes. The good thing is you kept the same table every night so got to know your neighbours and your waiter (Manuel was very good). No stomach upsets or any problems with the food. didn't bother with the speciality restaurants as the buffet was more than adequate wth pleny of choice some of which was cooked in front of you. ENTERAINMENT. The Animacion team worked hard to entertain those who wanted it. If you didn't, there was not too much pressure. My 4 year old loved the mini-disco every night (thanks to king). The shows were varied and we didn't see them all. Enjoyed Grease though and they really threw themselves into it. Other shows were mostly done by external professionals and were mostly dance orientated. ROOMS. Spacious with plenty of storage. No charge for safe deposit box which makes a change. Beds are hard, towels do smell a bit musty. Good minibar with optics. If you run out, reception organise replacements. Ceiling fan and AirCon. STAFF. They cannot do enough for you. From the cleaning staff (and there were loads) to the waiters, bartenders, reception staff, entertainment staff, they are there to ensure you have a good holdiay. BIGGEST PAIN? The Americans. We met Canadians, Argentinians, Chileans, Germans, Dutch and Swiss who were all really nice, The Americans however, seem to delight in crowding round whatever bar they can for as long as they can and make as much noise as they can. This included bad language which I thought was out of order whith kids around. And it wasn't the younger Americans either.....more like age 45+. A word of advice, we all want to enjoy our holiday so please be more considerate of the other holidaymakers in the hotel. SUMMARY. Our first trip to Mexico and we loved it. The people want to help you and are so friendly. The weather was superb......mid to late 80's everyday and no rain. Pleasant evenings although my wife needed a sweater a couple of nights. We would recommend the Yucatan. I understand it is undergoing a refurbishment soon and is closing for 4-6 weeks. I am quite surprised at this as from what we saw, the hotel and grounds are clean and despite oneor two small things, there should be very lile to refurbish.

Beware of timeshare people, cabs, etc. all saying they are Apple! Check-in: quick and easy. We arrived at 1:00 and the front desk clerk thought we were honeymooners and we were upgraded to a suite for no charge. And the room was ready right away!

There were a couple of people who reserved the chair the entire day and didn't come to the beach until 4:00 - rude! Because there are plenty of beach-goers who couldn't find seating. Activities/Shows: My husband played bochee every morning at 10:00 am. There are tons of well-organized activities. The shows are very cheesy, but funny once you get a few drinks in ya! The Michael Jackson show was very funny :) Food/Drinks: Great. There is always a big selection, but similiar every night. I would suggest making a reservation at one of the resteraunts.

It was a rude awakening back to reality with temps in the 20's and a fresh dusting of snow. We arrived in Sunny Mexico at 9 am on the 4th. A short 40 minute bus ride and we arrived at the Yucatan. Temps were in the low 80's. Taking a suggestion from this board, I emailed the resort requesting a room in bloque 4 and enquiring if the resort had any plans for the Superbowl and for Fat Tuesday. I didn't expect a response so you can imagine my surprise when they responded within 30 mins of my request. It was a response saying they would do what they could as far as my room request went, and they planned a superbowl party on the 6th in the theater. So we went to reception and enquired about our room- in was 11AM so we didn't expect a room to be ready but they recognized our name from my email and said they had a room ready in Bloque 7, and much to our surprise, they upgraded us at no charge to a suite. It was outstanding, a huge living room and bath with a separate bedroom and our balcony was huge, equivalent to two rooms! (Hint- if you send an email- send it en espanol!) We meandered around the resort and were pleased with everything we saw, the beach, the pool, the bars-- the staff went out of their way to make sure that any desire was met. They even stocked our fridge daily with Corona and Pepsi's, our glasses literally overflowed. As far as the dinners were concerned, they too were muy excellente! So many choices roast hog, salt encrusted fish, seafood payaya, steaks, and traditional Mexican food, we never tired eating at La Hacienda. Lunches at La Margarita were also outstanding, from calamari, to fish tostada's, and general American fare- hotdogs and hamburgers(we never sampled as we can eat that at home. Breakfast were also plentiful, 8 different fresh juices from orange and pineapple to banana and melon, so many fesh fruits omeletts to order potatos, bacaon meats and cheeses- too many items to name. (Can you tell we don't miss to many meals:) ) Day and evening activities were plentiful if you chose to partake, yoga on the beach, sand volleyball, water aerobics, bingo by the pool, bocce ball, ping pong tournaments you name it, it was available. We chose to soak up the sun and take part in the watersports, hobie cats, boogie boards, snorkel equipment and the like. The Animation team was very good, with shows that included Marichi Bands, and Carnivale Celebrations, and tropical shows. Plus the superbowl party they threw was a real plus. My wife and I chose not to go the organized tour route as we feel there are too many people and they lack the freedom to explore at your own pace. When I'm on vacation I don't like to be ruled by any type of a schedule. We chose to rent a motor scooter for a day and rode it all over Mexico, went into Playa to 5th avenue and enjoyed the opportunity to be badgered somewhat by the shop owners, but really enjoyed going off 5th avenue to the shops that the mexican nationals frequent, they were much more open to bartering and we ended up with many good buys. We took the ferry to Cozumel round trip for two was $8.00 and once there we struck up a converstaion with a a construction worker and asked him what he thought was the best place to snorkel. We bought a ticket for 35.00 on a glass bottom boat that took us to three separate reefs, all on a marine reserve, and one complete with an airplane wreck sunck at the bootom of the sea. My wife and I were the only two on the tour and we were free to swim wherever we wished. All the Corona and Soda we could drink and we were able to explore each location for an hour! Much better than the tours recommended by the travel agency- but a much higher risk! If you consider yourself somewhat adventurous, I highly recommend going out on your own! Back to our resort and back to the beach where we both enjoyed massages, and more sun- the weather was beautiful, and the nights could be considered cool. In fact we were able to keep our bacony doors open for the fresh ocean breeze. Now to the beach erosion-- the beaces going north toward the city have eroded significantly in some areas, some 4 to nine foot dropoffs begining at the Riu Palce and extending north passed the Occidental where they were using sand bags to shore up the area.the Yucatan's beach was in good shape, but by the end of our stay it did appear that the erosion was moving southward as we did lose one of the beach volleyball courts. Some said the major erosion was from hurrican Ivan, but what I was witnessing appears to be occurring due to rip tides. I have friends staying at the Iberostar Tucan in a month some I am anxious to see what they say. Our vacation was truly a paradise in paradise and we cannot wait to return. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend anyone to the Riu Yucatan as we encountered nothing negative! Before we left I read about the beds (the are hard!), the musty smell (didn't experience), and a foul smell of sewage (didn't encounter). We did bring insulated mugs, flashlights for walks on the beach, and scented candles in case we needed them (were very romantic) If you are going soon, enjoy your time it is definately time well spent!", "Date": "February 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thunder Bay, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Yucatan\u201d", "Author": "whiskallie", "ReviewID": "UR3174892", "Content": "Just arrived home after spending a wonderful week at the Yucatan from February 1 to 8.

I was told this hotel was a 5 star and a family place at that! I travelled with Sunquest travel agency, and paid close to 10 thousand for 4 adults and a 2.5 year old baby. First of all..This hotel had no changing tables for babies, and no baby beds for the rooms. The rooms themselves were average..like a confort inn. Beds were super unconfortable, and humid. The air conditioner worked went it wanted to. The toilet worked but the chain was broken inside. I have to say it was very clean..but we would have to leave a tip on our pillow to get the room properly cleaned everyday. The hotel itself was very clean, however the chairs and couches in the entrance were so used and torn. The pool was so small, and cold. The drinks they served in the resort were so horrible. They had pina coladas and daiquiris in slushy mixers mixing all day, which made them too watery and strong. The food in the buffets were the same everyday, too greasy and not enough desserts. The cloth over the tables were flipped over on the other side not even cleaned... Plus the hotel was over booked, which meant the service was just getting worse and worse. To some it up..The beach was super nice, but the hotel's service and food and rooms were pretty horrible..because of this experience I will never go back to a Riu hotel chain again.", "Date": "February 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cLife and Death at RIU Tequila and Yucatan\u201d", "Author": "timjames", "ReviewID": "UR3165080", "Content": "Don't let this this happen to you. The staff cleaned up my blood before I received medical treatment. I have several comments in regard to my treatment at RIU. I was at the sister property, RIU Yucatan, on 01/05/05, by the pool area, slipped by the pool, feel into the pool and hit my head against a restraint. This fall caused a cut that required eight stitches to close. During the time of this incident, which occurred at 11:30 AM, there was no assistance from the hotel staff for over 20 minutes, 11:50 AM. A two guests assisted me from the pool another one compressed the wound with a beach towel for almost 1 hour. When the Yucatan assistant general manager arrived after twenty minutes, 11:50 AM, she did not identify herself and said the doctor had been called. She was asked to identify herself and said her name was Petra and she was the assistant manager of the RIU Yucatan. One of the guests that was helping commented on the slipperiness of the pool edge area (it is smooth rubber, with no raised surfaces for traction). Petra commented that we were not in the United States and accidents happen. This comment was particularly distressing. I was still bleeding, the staff had cleaned the my blood by the pool, but had not administered first aid, or offered any assistance. The doctor arrived at approximately 12:20 PM. The doctor removed the towel and applied first aid. Petra told me and my friend that I would have to my credit card and my passport to obtain medical aid. Petra offered no assistance to my friend to return to our room to retrieve the credit card and passport. It took her twenty minutes to obtain the credit card and documents. No one on the RIU staff offered my friend any assistance, inlcuding the van driver between RIU Tequila (our hotel) and Yucatan, even though he was was told there was a medical emergency. Petra's insistence on the credit card caused the doctor to wait with me until my friend returned at 12:40 PM. By that time I hald lost a considerable amount of blood. No one from the RIU staff offered assistance from the pool area to the parking area. I believe there are wheel chairs available none were offered and Petra was gone. I had to wait over 50 minutes for treatment with a guest compressing my wound with a dirty bath towel, than listen to an assistant manager make insensitive comments about the injury and insist on a form of payment before I could receive medical treatment, receive no hotel assistance for my friend, nor any for me. I had to walk five minutes from the pool area to the doctors car. The doctor drove me to the hospital in Playa Del Carmen herself. The treatment required X-rays, and eight stitches. The doctors at the clinic did an excellant job. The total cost of the medical services were $678.00, which I paid for. I will require further examination in the United States. When I returned to RIU Tequila on 01/05/05 no one from the hotel contacted me. I spoke with with the RIU Tequila, general manager, Mr. Ponette, at 6:00 PM on 01/06/05. Mr. Panette said an incident report had been filed the previous day. I told him in detail what had happened. Mr. Panette agreed the question of payment should not have been an issue and Petra's demand for the credit card should not have slowed down receiving medical attention. I left a summary of the incident with Mr. Ponette. Mr. Ponette said he would look into ways to resolve this situation. If you like you may share this information with RIU and Mr. Ponette. I had a serious injury at an RIU property, received no assistance from their staff, had the time required for medical treatment extended due to RIU's demand for a form of payment. The guest who compressed my wound is a nurse, she saw no first aid kits, or any staff who knew how to provide first aid.

I stayed at the Iberostar in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic in 2004 and it was much, much nicer than this place. I would have stayed at the Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal next door, but it was booked for the time we were going. I went on a tour of the Iberostar Tucan next door when we got there and it was beautiful!!! I would never stay at the RUI Yucatan resort ever again. Complaints: Pool- Very, very, very small for a resort of this size and not many chairs that are actually in the sun. Most of the chairs are under shade huts. Room- Very damp and musty smelling and the beds were hard as a rock. The sheets in our room had stains on them when we checked in. Food- Average at best (I understand this is an all-inclusive, but i had much better in DOmenican Republic). Besides breakfast, food was not too good. For dinner, you had to pick a seating time for the dinner buffet(early or late seating). I like the flexibility of eating when I feel hungry. The set up in the buffet dining hall is awful. All the food stations are all in one row instead of be scattered out to allow people to move around. You end up standing in a line like cattle for 20 minutes just to get through the buffet! Most of the food is recycled leftovers from the night before. The food is awful!!!!! It does not look and it does not taste good either. The snack for lunch by the beach was bad. Lots of hot dogs and hamburgers. No Chicken filets. (I did not eat at the specialty restaurants b/c I heard the food was bad from many people staying at the resort). Beach- Because the pool is so small and there is little room for anyone, there are 1 million people on the beach. People are right on top of eachother at the beach. Forget about having some room or privacy. You have people all around you within 2 feet and I'm not kidding. Disco: The disco was tiny and maybe fit 50 people. It was a joke and no one was ever in it at night. Forget about that for entertainment at night. Grounds: Lots (about 100) of stray cats running around all over the resort. This is disgusting. Positives: Food- Breakfas was great. Ice Cream at Dinner tasted home-made. If you want more liquor in a drink- ask and they pour. Hotel Help- The help is amazing. Very friendly and they all spoke English for the majority which is nice for non-Spanish speaking individuals. The bartenders are great- always smiling and i never waited long at all for drinks. The bar always had more than enough bartenders. People at front desk were helpful and friendly. Entertainment- The shows at night were ok. Nothing great, but solid. Location- The resort is a 20 minute walk or two minute cab ride into the town of Playa del Carmen. It is very safe to leave the resort and walk during the day or night. The town is safe as well in the main shopping areas. Overall, the trip was very relaxing but the Resort was bad. The food was awful and the rooms were not the cleanest. Lots of Italians and Germans at this resot which didnt bother me at all. I didnt pay alot for this trip so I got what I paid for. Next time, I will stay next door at the Iberostar. I am an experienced traveler who has been all over the US as well as Italy and Mexico several times and this place is NOT 5 stars!!! Out of 6 stars, I would give this place 3 stars.

We could have stayed another week in Mexico, but probably not another week at the Yucatan. We went there for our honeymoon...I would recommend honeymooner's to go to an adults only resort if able. The first week there not too many families but the second week there were tons of families! Screaming kids and crying babies and mother yelling weren't my idea of romance! But all in all we had a great time! Rooms - When we check in we requested a room upgrade (no ocean views at this resort) which we got on our 3rd day. They didn't even have us marked down that we were honeymooner's! and when your honeymooner's you are suppose to get a bottle of Tequila and a fruit basket...well we got that 10 days later! Are room upgrade was the junior suite..huge! Always very clean and mini-bar stocked when suppose to. Food - Always the same thing, but lots of variety. We ate at the steak house 3 times and the, no complaints except the appy platter was never warm and my steak came under cooked once, but I didn't say anthing because ther were very busy that night. Our Christmans dinner was unbelieveable! Too much to describe! I was a bit disappointed in the margarita's and daquiri's...the mix is from a slushy machine...not that great. BEACH - Always crowded, after realizing on our 2nd day you have to get out there early in order to have a beach chair. We would go and reserve a couple of chairs about 8:00am and then go for breakfast. Very clean, water was great and lots of beach to walk! Tours - We went on our own instead of booking through our sunquest rep. We went to TULUM and to XEL-HA, 2 different days. If you go to TULUM be sure to bring your bathing suit...they have a gorgeous beach below. Xel-Ha is great for family and kids...lots to do. Try and get there first thing in the morning. We didn't get there until11:00 am and didn't even do 1/2 of the things there. I did swim with the Dolphins, great experience....I paid $115.00 US. for 1 hour. Both times we took the bus from Playe Del Carmen...cheap! and on the way back we took these shuttle buses. They are everywhere and only charge 25 pesos. Nightlife - Not much at the Yucatan, but that was OK for us. We usually went to the show at 10:00 and then staright for bed...b/c you know ya gotta get up early to reserve your chairs!!! They had a mix of shows some really good and some not so good. STAFF - The staff were great. Heiriberto and Eduardo at the main looby bar were fun....and fast! The entertainers at the hotel we great too, we got to know them as well, and my husband was dragged 4 times on stage...lots of laughs. All in all, had a great time.

To start with a few good points: the location, felt like being in the jungle with all sorts of animals which was very fun. The beach is very nice but the sea not as clear and warm as it is said. The Mexican staff are lovely. BUT, if you expect a 5 star hotel, do not go there, it is a 3 to 4 star hotel and the rooms (they are very tired and need a good redecorating and painting)are not even 4 stars but 3 roughly. The shower we had did not work properly and no one managed to fix it during our stay. Marks of mud on the terrace walls stayed for two weeks. On our check in we felt like we were not expected and our room wasn't ready, nothing in our minibar. we called reception to ask for the minibar to be filled (it was 7pm)and we were told that the person in charge of this job wasn't starting before 8.30 pm, so that we would have to wait. Shocking!! During our stay we also had some very loud german neighbours coming back late at night but not caring about the level of noise they were making. Not so nice!!! The FOOD is average and the same everyday, obviously made for a certain type of clientele. The buffet seems very important, but when when you look carefully you realise that it is the same food repeating itself continuously. The fish restaurant and the meat restaurant were just OK and again very boring as the food is the same all the time, it almost feels like the Head Chef has no ideas. Plus the eating times are too rigid, you must eat at this time or this time, very early or very late. We were also told that we could dine in any restaurants of any of the Riu hotels - but this is not true for the evenings, as you have to eat in your hotel. The swimming pool is very small and cold and if you don't come and reserve your lounger by 7am well you have no chance for the day. Peacefullness by the pool is interupted by the bingo and volleyball that monopolises the pool area. Quite a disgusting sewer smell around the pool area was there for the duration of our stay which puts off your appetite when you eat at the restaurant near the pool. The bar is fine and the staff well trained. The Reception staff don't know much about anything and if you are going to use the telephone in your room watch out for the bill (even with a phone card). The waiters are very nice but not very trained as for breakfast your plate is cleared as fast as they can and for lunch no-one is here to clear them! Well in general the five star standard we were expecting was far from being reached which was very unfortunate as they have a wonderful location.

The food in the buffet was excellent- I am a very picky eater only eating fish and chicken, and I no problems- every night the food was excellent- I did not think the a la carte restaurants were as good as the buffet- and neither did most other people as there was hardly anyone in! Lots of extras were available throughout the day and night (including sandwiches at 3am!)The hotel was really well run- I would have no complaints at all- all the staff were excellent, and it was in a great position to visit lots of places- the taxis to puerto del carmen only cost $5 including the tip! I found the pool area a little small, and being over Christmas the hotel eas full, so not everyone could find a sunbed, and like wise the beach was bery packed too, lots of jet skis, boats, etc and not much goos for snorkelling when we visited as it was quite choppy but very warm and a most beautiful colour. I loved the wild life at the hotel, and saw the monkeys right in front of my balcony on my last day. The drinks and cocktails were great, and the waiters were always giving you balloons they had made, and the aperitifs before your evening meal were a nice touch.

However the weather was really unpredictable - some days the sun was gone by 10.30am, you didn't need the air conditioning at all, I was actually quite cold at night!

As others have suggested, you have to adjust your expectations from what constitutes a 5-star resort in the US to what Mexico considers 5-star. There were three adults in our party. We booked the trip through Funjet. Here are my impressions: Cancun Airport: One word \u2013 chaos. If you were lucky coming and going, and we were, you can get through customs is 20-30 minutes. If not, prepare for waits of an hour or more if a number of charters have arrived at the same time. Lots of time share and tour hustlers at the airport exits; be sure to make a beeline for your ground transportation. Check In: No problems after they sorted through the various trip vouchers, and we were in our room within 30 minutes. That was when we discovered one of the few drawbacks of the Riu \u2013 NO elevators in any of the buildings. If you have elderly members in your party, be sure to insist on a ground floor room at check in. We were moved the next day, with no hassles, before noon. The front desk staff was always very helpful to us and seemed sincere in wanting to solve any problems or issues. The Beach: Outstanding. White sand, warm water (even in December!) and a gentle slope. Far nicer than the beach farther north toward Cancun. Lots of palm trees for shade if that\u2019s what you want, and plenty of sun loungers in the sun if you prefer to toast. The only problem, and it became a big one for us, was people holding chairs from 7 a.m. on, whether they were there or not. The hotel ignores its policy of asking guests not to do this, and it was a daily struggle to find even one lounger for my father. They really need to clamp down on this, because if you got out to the beach much after 10 a.m., you were usually out of luck if you wanted a lounger. The Pool: Just OK, no better than that. For the size of the Riu Yucatan, the pool is small, but it was clean even when overcrowded (which was from 9 a.m. on). The jacuzzi is broken and only bubbles cool water. That was an issue for us. It has apparently been broken for quite some time, and no explanation from management could be extracted as to when it might be fixed. The Rooms: This is where you must adjust your expectations in a major way. Think Comfort Inn or Ramada Limited, NOT 5-star. The beds are hard, which becomes very noticeable after a couple of nights, and the room lighting is very, very dim. If you\u2019re planning on reading in the evening, bring a book light with you. And a smoke alarm, none of the rooms has one. Everything worked, including the clunky safe, although they had to remember to turn the phones on when we switched rooms (???). The mini-fridge was restocked every day when we were there; we never had fewer than three of the large bottles of water on hand, which was great, and never ran out of Corona beer. There were extra blankets in our second room. One annoying thing, the housekeeping staff left the sliding door to the patio unlocked after cleaning every day, not good with a ground floor room! Something to be aware of. The Grounds: One of the Riu Yucatan\u2019s strong points \u2013 you will feel like you are in a jungle, albeit a well-manicured one, from the moment you leave the main lodge and head to your room. Birds in abundance; iguanas (adults and babies, while we were there); the cute little zereques (they look like big, awkward guinea pigs); howler monkeys were in the trees when we were there. Lighting at night was adequate except around the pool; bring a flashlight if you\u2019re going to one of the specialty restaurants or out on the beach. Like others, however, we too noticed the sometimes overpowering sewage odor near the pool after dark. Food: No complaints at all about the main dining room, the Hacienda, and we did not get bored with the cuisine the entire week we were there. Yes, there are waits if you want something made to order, but what do you expect? There was always plenty of variety at the Hacienda and the quality was generally good \u2013 if you can\u2019t find something you like there, then you must be capable of living on air and sand alone. The staff outdid itself for the Christmas Eve dinner, it was nothing short of amazing. An entire tower of choice shrimp, a half-dozen kinds of meats carved to order, fresh fruits of every possible description \u2026 that one meal shows the Riu chain knows how to put on a presentation. The Margarita restaurant by the pool was fine for a late lunch or mid-afternoon snack, no complaints about the variety there. The only issue was that, as closing time for each place draws near, they stop putting out silverware and plates. It was a challenge eating guacamole and pasta salad with a knife, but hey, it worked. As for the \u201cspecialty\u201d restaurants \u2013 we ate at the steakhouse one night, had three different dinners, and all were good to great as far as the cut of meat, amount of side dishes and service. The Mediterranean restaurant, well \u2026 Long John Silver\u2019s or Captain D\u2019s does a better job. No one in their right mind, and I mean no one, gives you unpeeled shrimp covered in tomato sauce and then expects you to eat them with a knife and fork. That was just stupid, and that meal was a huge disappointment for all of us. Excursions: Since this was our first visit to Mexico, we chose to book two trips through the Funjet/Lomas Tours representative, Sergio, who did an excellent job of matching our desires and physical mobility with trips. We did the one-day bus trip to Coba and a Mayan village. Our guide, Anselmo, was a wealth of knowledge and kept us entertained there and back, as well as at each site. Coba was magnificent. One thing to remember, if you climb to the top of the temple, you also have to climb back down! No escalators, which seemed to really surprise some people; go figure. Combining that with visiting the Mayans was an excellent way to get a feel for the rich culture and proud heritage of these people. The second trip with a dune buggy excursion around Cozumel, which was also good. Regardless of how calm the water looks, though, take Dramamine or something similar for the ferry ride both ways; when we came back that night there were 6-8 foot seas and a then whole lot of puking going on. On the trip we got to see a lot of the island, as we had to go to Punta Morena on the east side to snorkel. An amazing array of sea life, even though it wasn\u2019t one of the major reefs \u2013 lobsters, stingrays, corals in a dozen hues, fish right out of a National Geographic photo spread. We also explored Fifth Avenue in downtown Playa del Carmen (take a taxi, $4 US and plentiful) and the Plaza Playacar mini-mall which is about a 5-minute walk from the Riu Yucatan. Predictably, the prices get cheaper the farther away from the hotels you are, if you are planning to bargain and pay cash. Not to be missed is the Xaman Ha Bird and Wildlife Preserve, between the Riu and Playa del Carmen. The $15 US admission may seem steep, but you can spend hours there in a shady, jungle atmosphere literally adjoining the bustle of the Playacar area, with flamingoes, pelicans, iguanas, macaws, parrots, you name it. It is small enough that you can let kids roam in relative comfort. Conclusion: Would we go back to the Riu Yucatan? Probably not. It is a very nice resort and they handle all the main things well, but if you are looking for an impeccable 5-star resort where all of the details, large and small, are always stayed on top of, this is not it. Major pros are the beachfront location, the grounds, the food (in general) and the convenient location.

The hotel's surroundings are beautiful. The landscaping is great, and there is an abundance of wildlife (monkeys in the trees, birds, guinea pig like rodents, etc). The monkeys are small so they are not scary, and one day we saw someone reach up and feed one a banana, which it quickly devoured. There were a few stray looking cats too, but they didnt bother us at all. The food is awesome, the dinner buffet offers a huge selection, and the lunch is buffet style too, with less selection. The buffet breakfast had the best pancakes I have ever had, along with tons of other food. We didnt go to the a la carte resturants at all because we liked the selection at the buffet. The only complaint we had was that my girlfriend found some of the dishes at the buffets too greasy, but there was enough of a selection for her to work around this. The pool was somewhat small, but very nice with a swim up bar, and the beach was amazing. The drinks were all very good too. The hotel has planned activities throughout the day (volleyball, water arobics, scuba lessons) all free too if you want to do that. The rooms were nicely prepared and clean, and the beds were somewhat hard, but it didnt bother us.

I am an avid reader of tripadvisor and rely on other's opinions when booking my vacations. My review is honest and I hope my advice helps! Overall, I really enjoyed the Riu Yucatan, but I had several strong dislikes and will not consider returning. The beach is the best part of the hotel. It's a large area with shade or sun, plenty of chairs, beautiful scenery, and water activities. The pool is small for a resort this large and most of the seating there is in the shade. The pool isn't dirty - some of the paint is peeling off at the bottom and thus the coloring is different. But the pool isn't filthy as others commented. In order to get a chair by the pool, you do need to get up early and reserve one. The \"hot tub\" is filled with cold water and is quite disappointing. The beach is truly outstanding and should probably be the focus of your visit. The hotel isn't very large and everything was within a short walking distance. (We were in building 2 and felt that it was a perfect spot. A one-minute walk to the pool, lobby, bar, and restaurants.) The food was good but not 5 stars by any means. I disagree with most reviewers, as I believe the a la carte restaurants were worth going to, especially the Seafood one. We always managed to get a reservation and did not have to wake up at 7 am to get one. If you are from the NYC area and are accustomed to eating at fabulous restaurants, you will tire of the food by the 3rd or 4th day and long for home. But I never went hungry and always found something to eat. The drinks were fine and you can order doubles if you feel they are weak. For true alocoholics, there are 4 hard liquor bottles on tap in the room plus a well stocked mini-fridge. I would have loved this in college! Everyone is right - the beds are horrible. For the first 3 nights, we slept great and couldn't understand why people were complaining. By the 4th night, we barely slept and were in pain. The best way to describe it is like sleeping on a rock. I also did not enjoy the 2 full beds that were pushed together to make a king. The beds are made up separately and you can't take advantage of both beds unless one person sleeps in the crack. My fiancee and I agreed that this was the worst part of the vacation. We were looking forward to our beds back home. However, the room was very clean. I am terribly allergic to cats. The gardens of the hotel are home to about 25 plus stray cats. Most people seemed to enjoy feeding them, but I hated their presence. Just a sampling of my discomfort: awoken at 3 am several nights by a wild cat fight on my porch, cats wandering around in the a la carte restaurants looking for food, cats lounging along the walking paths towards the lobby, cats lounging on the deck of my patio. Needless to say, I did alot of sneezing last week. I don't understand why a 4 or 5 star hotel would allow these animals to exist on the property. I do intend to write the Riu management about this issue. If I had known the extent of their presence, I never would have stayed here. Consider this a warning to my fellow allergic friends! The staff is absolutely amazing. Everyone is polite, professional, and willing to go above and beyond to make you happy. Please tip these people - they deserve it! We never encountered an attitude or unfriendly staff member. Everyone speaks enough English to be able to communicate. Overall, I had a great vacation and thought it was a great value for the money. I would rate this as a three and a half star resort with a 5 star staff. I would hesitate recommending this resort to friends & family if they were looking for rest and relaxation due to the beds.

Yes, the airport was a bit of a nightmare after a 10 hour flight but we just thought it added to the Mexican charm! Wouldn't have wanted to do it with small children though. We booked with Thompson and we were already allocated a room and checked in with a safety deposit key when we got on the bus from the airport, so when we got to the hotel, all we had to do was put a sticker on our bags with our room number on it, enjoy the welcome drink (not sure what it was) and wander up to our rooms. Our rooms were lovely, nicely decorated with a bathroom/dressing area and shower cubicle. The air con was excellent so it was nice to come back to after a hard day by the pool! Halfway through our secong week our toilet blocked, we told reception, they fixed it within an hour and then gave us a quick call a few hours later to check everything was OK. We didn't really get much use out of the mini bar, we preferred the company of the bar staff, but it was refilled as promised in the brochure. We thought the pool was really nice. It was smaller than the pools at the Tequilla and the Playacar but that didn't bother us as we're not really swimmers. We did hear they have plans to extend it next year. One us is an early riser so he was able to get sun lounger by the pool for all of us most days (except when the hangovers were really bad). Space is limited around the pool but there is plenty of room on the beach. The pool bar was nice to sit at when it got really hot, a good place to make friends. We had read a couple of review saying that there was a lot of topless sunbathing around the pool, our husbands were really looking forward to this! They were sadly disappointed, there were one or two women topless but not many. There were some large men with 'man boobs' so maybe thats what other reviewers were talking about! The beach is the stuff of fairytales. The sand was pure white powder and the sea was a beautiful tourquoise. The boogy boards and snorkels kept the menfolk out of our way so we could read in peace! We really enjoyed the food in the main buffet restaurant. We have all put loads of weight on, so don't come here if you want to be skinny! There is so much to choose from, even the fussiest eater can't fail to be impressed. The steak and seafood restaurants in the evening were nothing much to rave about but they were nice at lunch time. One of us has a seafood allergy but there was plenty of other stuff to eat every day. The hotel was kept very clean, everywhere you go someone was sweeping, mopping or raking leaves, always with a smile and a 'hola'. There was a strange vinegary smell about the place sometimes but we discovered that its the bleach that they use. We had some great trips out. The boys did the speedbot trip which they thouroughly enjoyed, booked through Thompson, it was $67 each. The girls went to Tulum, booked through the only travel operator in Playa del Carmen that doesn't try to drag you in off the street. It cost us $35 each and it was a wonderful place. We also did Chichen Iza though Thompson ($99 each). The whole day was good, nice coach, free drinks, nice lunch included. Chichen Itza itself is amazing, do not go all the way to Mexico and miss it. Be warned, wear good shoes or trainers if you want to climb the pyramid, those steps are very steep but the view from the topis awesome. It also very hot so take some water and a hat. The tour guide was reallly informative but if, when, we go back we would just get a taxi and have more time to wander around on our own. What we feel really made our holiday was the staff at the hotel. They couldn't do enough for us. Everyone was very friendly, from Roberto who cleaned our rooms to Antonio in the restaurant. We had a great time at the bar in the evenings with Gasper, Alfredo and Juverley. We can't praise these guys enough, they work so hard and are still always up for a laugh. Some of the reviews on this site are very negative about the Yucatan. All I can say is, these people didn't go to the same place we did. We can't recommend it highly enough.

Airport Be prepared for 2-4 hour queues to get processed through Cancun airport (we swore that no matter what our holiday was like we would not return as to start your precious holiday in this way is not conducive to rest) especially if you land with another plane or two at the same time. However we might over rule our first impression! Hotel Set in beautiful jungle landscape with all sorts of wildlife \u2013 monkeys, crazy birds, jungle rodent/pig like animals. All the residential blocks set in really nice surroundings with blocks 5 and 6 being the best \u2013 nearest the pool; beach and entertainment later on (although it won\u2019t keep you awake if you are an early bird to bed). If you are on a package holiday send an e mail to hotel direct to see if they can slot you in either one. We did and also got our rooms adjacent to the kids. Hotel nationality split was approx. 25% English:15% US:10%Icelandic: 20% German: 10%Mexican: 20% Other European \u2013 a good mix. Rooms OK. The swim up bar tended to attract the US gang and why smoking is allowed in a pool with kids beats me \u2013 from a very tolerant occasional smoker! The hotel has its own fantastic beach \u2013 white sand and water colour vivid Caribbean green better than in the brochures. Not too crowded and always shade available from the palm trees \u2013 but get up early for the best spots. Great FOC water sports from the hotel. Really cheap catamaran lesson that gets you going and solo after 1 hour. Nice walk to the right where there is a little cove with good snorkeling. Regardless of any comments I saw in other e mails, the food is excellent in all areas, especially evening dinner. We did not find any merit in eating at the speciality restaurants as the main buffets were very good and we like good food! Breakfasts and lunches were also great. The staff were absolutely brilliant, brilliant, couldn\u2019t do enough for you and so friendly. The bar staff in the \u201cEl Templo\u201d bar theatre where the main entertainment took place were a scream. Gasper, Alfredo, Juvily and Daniel really had the patrons in fits with their antics. We walked to all the other hotels in the Playacar Riu group and no where was as much fun as the staff here. The professional entertainment on the whole was also very good with the hotels animation team coordinating it all. Playa Del Carmen A good half hour walk in very warm/humid conditions \u2013 take a taxi! PDC is best seen first at night, a great place with plenty of atmosphere, watering holes, restaurants and souvenir shops. But if you are European/English the shops are pretty awful if you are not after some \u201csilver\u201d bargains. For all money transactions UK people should use Peso prices at all times and change to Peso\u2019s from \u00a3Stirling\u2013 the rate is much better than taking US$. Most price lists are in US$. Cozumel Nice day out with great snorkeling and better shopping. Crazy Mexico \u2013 the two opposing ferry companies that serve the island of Cozumel with their \u201cJet Catamarans\u201d actually both leave at the same time on the hour. They compete for your ticket sale as you approach the jetty and then race each other to the island when the boat leaves on the hour instead of staggering their departure times and taking a leisurely stroll to Cozumel. Talum Fascinating trip to a world class archaelogical site in breath taking position on the coast. If you don\u2019t fancy the rep\u2019s tour take a taxi there \u2013 they will stay there while you visit and bring you back for \u00a330. Hire a guide for an hour whilst there if you rally want to know everything. Others We went on an extreme jungle crossing tour which was really good \u2013 Snorkeling in under water caves, unimog trip into the countryside and sea snorkeling on a reef \u2013 swam with turtles and rays, all in the wild and not touristy at all.

Had a wonderful time, everything at the Yucatan was clean and staff was really friendly - food was just okay. We parasailed off the beach at the Yucatan was worth the $$. Had a midnight walk after hopping from hotel to hotel but were pretty tired from day excursions and we did not participate much in the night life.

However, if we go again to the Riveria Maya, think we would rent a condo or a house as we did a few excursions on our own ie: rented a jeep from Hertz one day and hired our own guide and snorkeled in Dos Ojos (gorgous fresh water cenote) and Akumal (saw sea turtles off Akumal Beach).

We hired him for 2 days but you can hire him for a day or week if you want. He went with us a day to Cozumel and we went down 124 feet in the Atlantis Submarine - since we do not dive - he suggested this as he stated the reef is really something you need to see if in Cozumel - saw sharks, angel fish, schools of snapper..you name it ...even saw the abyss off the side of the reef :) We then rented a VW Bug and drove to the other side of Cozumel and hung out at Punta Sur for a few hours just for the view at a little Regaee Bar there - absolutely gorgeous !!!

The reception area is very impressive with it's polished marble style floor and decorated high ceiling. There's even a horse carriage in the middle of this area. All the staff are very friendly and will bend over backwards to attend to your needs. The food is superb. The main buffet is served in the Hacienda restaurant. There is huge amount of food, everything from traditional Mexican, Italian to good old burger and chips. If you can't find anything you like here then you never will. There are also 2 other 'a la carte' restaurants near the pool which you need to book for in the morning. During September I suspect that because it wasn't busy we had no problem booking a table as late as 10am in the morning - you will probably have to book earlier in high season as some of the other reviews suggest. There are several bars at the Yucatan all serving very tasty alcoholic and non alcoholic cocktails plus beers and spirits. Like other reviews mention I suspect the drinks are watered down. Being a bit of a 'lightweight' drinker I was able to consume twice my usual capacity without feeling much effect. You also have a minibar in your room which includes rum, vodka and tequila plus beer and soft drinks. The bedroom itself was quite spacious with very welcome air conditioning. There is a safe for any valuables in the wardrobe. The only bad thing about the room was the shower. The mounting wasn't very secure so it flew off when turned on and sprayed water all over the place. The grounds of the Yucatan are like a mini jungle. There were monkeys which make the most bizarre roaring noise, geckos and sort of large guinea pigs (possibly Coypu). The pool is a reasonable size and very warm. Unfortunately this seemed to be dominated by endless water volleyball games whenever we wanted a swim. There's also a jacuzzi but the water smells odd. Next to the pool is the main entertainment building. There was a strange smell around the bar here which I can only describe as vinegary stale alcohol. There's also soft drinks dispensers and nachos whenever you want them. The beach - well wow, white sand, palm trees and clear blue warm sea. It really is beautiful. You can also take out pedalos, canoes and wind surfs if you so desire. You need to sign a disclaimer before you take any of these out and watch out for 'jetski jockies' as they race around all over the place. Evening entertainment is based around the bar next to the pool. Oh dear, it's a bit cheesy. The entertainment staff love audience participation so if you don't want to make a complete idiot of yourself don't sit near the stage or you'll get dragged up there. There were some good dancing shows but I'm afraid the live band murdered some respectable well known songs. Outside the hotel there are some gift shops at Playacar about 5 minutes walk from the hotel. Also there is a bird park about a mile away where you can see parrots, toucans and pelicans. If you go to Playa del Carmen it's best to get a taxi which is cheap and quick. There are lots of gift shops selling the usual tourist keepsakes and some restaurants. Expect to get harrassed by people selling excursions or wanting you to go into their shops. From Playa del Carmen you can get the ferry to Cozumel which is cheap, modern and fast. These run just about every hour. Once at Cozumel expect more harrassment from street sellers and shop staff. Just look straight ahead and keep walking if you're not interested. There many intesting shops here but expect to be followed closely by shop staff whilst browsing. In terms of excursions we went to Xcaret which is an ecopark with dolphins, sea turtles, and aquaruim and big cats. There was also an evening show here including Mayan costumes and Mexican music and dancing. This was very good and well worth seeing. We also went to the ancient city of Chichen Itza where you can go up to the top of the pyramid of Kuculcan and see the other ruins. This was amazing to see.

The only word I can use to describe this place is unbelievable. The foyer of the hotel was like something out of a film (Very Grande). The restaurants and food were amazing, there was always plenty of choice and the food never ran out. We only visited the steak house once and to be honest it wasnt as good as the food in the buffet restaurant. The staff really couldnt do enough for you, as soon as you emptied one glass they replaced it with another. As with most All Inclusive hotels the entertainment wasnt great but they certainly got 10 out of 10 for effort!! We used to walk over to the Riu Tequilla and go into there nightclub which was usually a good night. The grounds are lovely and the animals are great. The monkeys tend to hide away so you dont see them much but you can certainly hear them!!!! They also have a few cats who seemed to appreciate the meat I used to take from the restaurant for them three times a day!! The beaches are breath taking and immaculately clean, the water can be rough at times though so be careful. The only bad thing we experienced whilst there was one of the excursions called \"The Fat Cat\". Its basically a boat trip on a catamaran. The only thing i can advise is that you dont go on this unless youve got a extremely strong stomach. Its the only trip ive been on where you get shown where the buckets are before you set sail!!! The sea was very rough and the way the boat was being thrown about was terrifying. After an hour the boat had to stop and 6 of us had to swim to shore with our belongings in a bin liner because we were being so sick. We were then left to get back to the hotels by ourself (Not my idea of fun and aparantly this happend on nearly every trip they made). Put the money you save to good use and go to swim with the dolphins instead. On out tenth day at the hotel we got offered a chance to move to there new 5 Star Plus hotel in Cancun called the Rui Palace Las Americas and regretfully now we chose to go. Although the hotel was amazing the staff were not half as nice as the Yucatan lot and we were happy to leave there after 4 days. I would have no hesitation in recommending the Yucatan to anyone, its faultless and the people are really lovely.

Four adults and two 13 y.o. boys. Bought the trip from Apple vacations and again didn\u2019t regret it. They are doing excellent job giving introductory briefings, useful tips and well organized pickup/drop off service. This was our second stays in Riu all inclusive resorts. Last year we have stayed in Riu Merenge (Dominican Rep). I took a lot of suggestions from this site and would be more than happy to share my experience with you. Beach: Absolutely gorgeous, beautiful, wide beach with white sand, clear greenish blue water and a lot of palm trees. We walked through all adjacent resorts and decided that our beach is the best. Some of the beaches are bold, with no trees, some of them have palapas. To find a shade was important for us and we found a permanent shady spot between Margarita restaurant and orange volleyball net. On 7:00 a.m. you can reserve any spot you want on the beach or by pool. The Scuba Caribe runs all water sports on the beach. You will see station and people in white t-shirts always ready to give you any info. Catamarans, boogie boards, kayaks, paddle boats, surf boards were always available without reservation. Only minor drawback was only one shower basin per exit. Every time you get off the beach to get some food or drink you have to wait for few minutes to wash sand off you feet. Kinda annoying \u2026it\u2019s so easy to fix. A lot of topless Europeans on the beach\u2026no matter where you look you see them everywhere. Just be aware of that especially if you have kids. There are not many Americans in this resort and especially in Tequila. Much more are in Playacar and Sunscape Tulum. Pool: Way too small. It\u2019s a shame to have such a small pool for resort this caliber. There is no room for maneuvers, sport and even swim. As a result the pool is always overcrowded and hot. You can\u2019t cool off in it. If you prefer pool rather than beach this resort is not for you. Fortunately this wasn\u2019t important for us because we spent all our time on the beach. Grounds: Like most Riu Hotels it is very well laid out, close to everything. Curved walkways, light poles, a lot of trees\u2026. This is the only Riu resort that has real jungle-like design. That\u2019s why every day you\u2019ll see a lot of animals, iguanas, exotic birds in their natural habitat even monkeys (certain time of the year). Riu Playacar and Tequila are more park like, Riu Palace has fancy architecture, fountains, beautiful gardening, shady beach but like somebody mentioned a little cold and exposed. Shade was very important for us because the only way to beat the heat is to stay in a shade or in the water. Even on your way to a restaurant you can feel the heat scorching your back. In Riu Yucatan no matter where you go you are always in the shade. Rooms: We had a regular room on the second floor with bright Mexican colors and jungle view. Big balcony with two chairs, AC, shower\u2026.everything was working fine. Some people complained about hard mattresses\u2026..yeah\u2026they are kinda hard\u2026..but not that hard that you can\u2019t sleep on them. I wouldn\u2019t deduct any points for that. My dreams weren\u2019t affected by the mattress. Food/Drink: Big variety of food. Seafood every day, meat, all kinds of cheese, authentical Mexican food...you name it. Every day you will find something new. We loved smoothies every morning from fresh fruits. Following suggestion from this site we didn\u2019t go to the steak house, we were more than satisfied with the main restaurant ( Hasienda). I would give my suggestion to use La Hasienda restaurant for lunch and dinner. At first it is not much fun to eat on open air in Margarita with 100 degrees outside, it doesn\u2019t have as many choices as the main restaurant and third sometimes it\u2019s crowded because people from Tequila prefer to stay there for lunch rather than take the long walk to their home resort. Compared to the Dominican Republic I noticed some shortage on Mangos and passion fruit. Mango was not available everyday, sometimes they ran out of it very fast. Passion fruit I tried only once for my 9 days stay. I agree with folks saying that drinks are watered, don\u2019t have much alcohol\u2026 It\u2019s true. But you have to know what to order. Tequila Boom\u2013Boom is very a popular and strong drink. If you like margarita it\u2019s much better to have it on rocks. If you wanna get buzz faster, mix their sweet watered drinks with straight shots. Works fine. Again, no point deductions. Service/ Entertainment: We didn\u2019t really deal with management. Two times I asked about extra bath towel and it was delivered to our room in an hour. Room service people, cleaning personnel were doing excellent job. They are working very hard and deserve to be tipped. I saw them singing while cleaning rooms, cutting leaves or sweeping sidewalks. I can\u2019t say the same words about the animation team. They didn\u2019t try hard to call people to participate in the tournaments and I observed some lack of organization skills. Night show was so-so. I\u2019ve seen better. Most of the shows were performed by local talents or the Riu ballet group\u2026Perhaps they are good for playing music and dancing in the lobby after dinner, but not for the night show. On the shows with tourists like men versus women or couples competition I saw same old jokes and tricks from the stone age. And don\u2019t try to go to other Riu resorts\u2026they rotate the same shows between all of the Riu resorts in that area. Other resorts like Iberostar or Bahia have way better night shows than Riu. Excursions/ Playa Del Carmen: We booked a snorkeling trip from Cozumel through the Scuba Caribe people. It cost $ 25 plus $18 for ferry versus $75 from Apple Vacations. They told us that the boat was going to bring us to three different well known reefs and they even showed us a map and nice color pictures. Instead of that the boat brought us to some place with plain sandy bottom with single corals. We saw a lot of beautiful fish but the \u201creef\u201d itself was a joke. I snorkeled in Dominican Republic and saw live corals with amazing colors and shapes. That was our biggest disappointment, especially while Cozumel claiming itself the second biggest reef in the word after Australia. So make sure you know where you going, maybe if you find somebody who has already took the same trip. We decided not to go to see pyramids because of the very hot weather. Instead we chose to take a cab ($10) to drive to Xcaret($45) and it was right move. There are replicas of all well known Mexican pyramids, animals, huge turtles, aquarium, parrots, butterfly pavilion. Plan your day in the park so you don\u2019t miss all of the wonderful shows they have. At the info center they tell you the time and location. Two underground rivers are fantastic as well as the snorkeling inlet. Apple Vacation sells this trip for $75. Bus brings you in a morning, around 1.00pm takes you back in resort for the lunch and than brings you back to Xcaret. It isn\u2019t worth it. It takes too much time to drop people off to different resorts and then pick em up. Better to go by yourself and have lunch in any of Mexican Restaurants inside the park. Playa del Carmen is nice safe small Mexican Town .Most of the tourists hang out on 5th Ave. We didn\u2019t go to any restaurants even though they looked very attractive. If you wanna do shopping over there bargain hard and have exact change. Prices are very similar to US prices except for liquor and cigarettes. Best prices I saw in small gift shops off 5th Ave and in Cancun Airport gift shop. We also visited Lapis jewelry factory. There are free tours to the factory then to Playa del Carmen. Big place, beautiful interior, a lot of high quality pieces of jewelry but prices are way too high. Thin gold necklace with single diamond 0.22 carat they try to sell us for $1800. The manager offer us \u201cincredible\u201d discount-$1380. I would think twice to give them $500 for that necklace Overall, a very nice trip and we had a good time. I suggest you when picking resort to stay go by you preferences. I mean every resort even top ranked have some drawbacks like lack of palapas on a beach, food, night entertainment, poor choice of water sports, small rooms, snobby people. Riu is well known established chain of good quality resorts. The weak spot for Yucatan is the pool and mediocre night entertainment. Tequila is far from the sea you don\u2019t want to go back and forth from the beach for dinner and lunch. Still it is a great resort to start exploring Mexico. But we never go back to the same place. If we go there again we will probably try a better ranked resort like Paradisus, Royal Hideaway or Iberostar.

We had a fabulous time!! The food was very good, lots of variety. Definitely something for everyone. We liked both the a'la Carte restaurants, and the Mediterranean restaurant had the best Salmon dinner. We found it peculiar that at the Tequila and Playacar you needed to have a shirt on in the lunch bar and in the Yucatan you did not. I found it a little unsettling to see people at the salad bar in the heat with no shirt on. The staff was very accommodating and was great with the kids. Lots of energy and always happy to see you. \"King\" is in charge of the kids club and is alot of fun. We did not find the drinks watered down. We went through 2 bottles of Tequila in the room and it was straight up!! The kids enjoyed going to the bar and getting their non-alcoholic drinks. The beach is absolutely speechless; we lived there, we swam and snorkeled down by the Riu Playacar. There is a man made reef and we would feed the Angel fish bread and they would almost jump out of the water at us. It was very cool. We also fell in love with the cats at the hotel, my kids fed them everyday! We went to Xel-Ha and swam with the dolphins, that was great! We stayed all day and did things around the park-but the snorkeling was better at our beach then Xel-Ha and cheaper. We also did a half-day in Tulum. It was a very HOT day (every day is HOT) and we enjoyed the fact we could swim in the ocean. The temperature and humidity was very high. It was 37 C at 11:00 AM with 100% humidity!! The only complaint I would have is the pool is not cleaned enough. We did check out the Riu Tequila and Playacar, they had good pools, which were bigger. The swim up bar pool, was separated from the other pool, this is a much better idea. My girls were in the pool every day the first week (along with the beach) and we ended up at the doctors, both had ear infections. Thank goodness for out of country medical! They were not the only kids with ear infections. We spoke with many families after that and their kids were on penecilin as well for ear infections! So we spent more time on the beach!

We took our two daughters, 11 and 14, and they loved it. The location is ideal - it appears to be within a gated community, and there is also security at the entrance to each hotel, so we felt very safe. However, you were also close enough (1.4 miles) to the town of Playa del Carmen to walk in or take a $4 cab ride and get the \"real\" Mexican experience. Being from Colorado, we were very worried about the heat, but we survived. Since you are in the water much of the time, it is really very pleasant. We had a few days where it clouded up and rained in the afternoon, which really cooled things off. The best time at the beach is from 6:00 pm until dark, and nobody is there! The rooms at the resort were fine, not overly large or fancy, but were perfectly adequate. Our one mechanical problem was attended to immediately. The tap water is not drinkable so you have to drink the bottled water provided in the in-room fridge. We ran out of this rather quickly and it was only replaced every other day, despite a few requests for new bottles to the front desk. So, we just refilled the bottles at the taps in the restaurants, no big deal. The food was great and there was a huge variety. We ate at the steak house twice and really liked it. The seafood a-la-carte restaraunt was OK, but nothing to rave about. My husband and I sometimes ate at different restaurants and at different times from our kids, which was fun for everyone, and worked out great. I got plenty buzzed on the drinks, so don't worry about that! The girls had lots of fun ordering the non-alcoholic frozen fruity drinks. We really enjoyed the activities offered at the hotel (dance lessons, water aerobics, boche ball, etc.) and got a kick out of the evening entertainment. Some of it was a bit hokey - not Las Vegas quality, but was a lot of fun. The entertainment staff was very energetic and personable. Take advantage of the free water sports. You have to sign a waiver on the first day, and can then check out equipment (kayak, body board, paddleboat, catamaran, etc.) for an hour at a time. I think the hour limit is just so everyone can get an opportunity to use the equipment. We sometimes checked out the same equipment (such as a kayak) several times during a given day. We had a few days of rough seas and the water staff did not allow the paddle boats and catamarans to go out, so make sure you take advantage of this equipment on calm days. We didn't do much touring because of the heat and the kids. We took the 1/2 day guided trip to Tulum ($38) and it was great. Beautiful location, great ruins, nice tour, but not too long. Make sure you wear your suit because you'll want to cool off in the ocean after the tour (there is a nice beach there). We also took a short snorkel trip through Scuba Caribe, which is the company that runs all the water sports right on the beach at the resort. They take you by boat about 15 minutes to a nearby shallow water coral reef, then you snorkel for an hour. It was great! None of us had ever snorkeled before so it was perfect for first-timers. We saw lots of colorful coral and water plants, plus beautiful tropical fish. The trip cost $29, which we thought was a good deal. As everyone else has mentioned, lots of Europeans, which really added to our experience. Lot of different languages heard and lots of Speedo's on the men (yeah!). We met some very nice people. Our one downer happened on the last evening when someone stole my husband's very expensive running shoes off our 1st floor patio.

There are a few perma-shade spots at the beach (infront of the Margarita resteraunt by the orange volley ball net) which you can save with a t-shirt. The towel place opens at 9 and it is too late. My husband would reserve 4 chairs with a beach bag and a few t-shirts at 7am. It was worth it. We had been to Riu Bambu in Dominican and this was better! We were disappointed to not see any monkeys - I asked the locals and it is autumn in Mexico, the monkeys come out in 10 days when the fruit ripens and we just missed it. You will see other interesting wildlife there. When going into Playa del Carmen to shop, go to a Playa Mart store or Deli Mart where they sell liquor and you will get great deals without the hastle of being led down an alley, like we were. There are 3 major ones if you walk around. Don't bother bartering, you get ripped off and their merchandise is cheap and old!

I have read countless reviews on this board and others and can only conclude that if people have complaints then they must be the kind of people that could never be happy with anything, need something to complain about and are picky eaters.

Went with a large group of family, 15 most of which were children under 13. Had great weather and an enjoyable time, but probably would not return to this resort again. Pros: Beach was large and water was beautiful. No seaweed, white sand, plenty of shade, and never had a problem finding enough chairs for all of us. Food was good for an all inclusive in Mexico. I've been to the Iberostar Quetzal, Barcelo Maya, and the Renissance Grande in Jamaica and the Riu had the best food of the group. Service was excellent. Front desk did a great job getting us switched from 5 rooms in the back of the hotel near the street to 5 rooms right in front of the pool closest to the beach. Dining staff also did a great job getting us 15 seats together for dinner. Cons: Rooms are very small mattresses hard, but how much time do you actually spend in your room anyway, didn't really bother me. (Note: every room has the beds pushed together to form 1 giant bed, if this is a problem the beds can easily be pushed apart to make 2 beds.) Lots of mosquitos, this may be seasonal, never noticed them when I traveled over spring break. Steakhouse...not good. The biggest disappointment were the drinks. Frozen drinks were not frozen at all very watered down, couldn't get a good margarita. Pre maid mixes they had were not good either. My advice is to ask for everything on the rocks that way they make it from scratch. Cultural differences- there were a lot of Europeans vacationing and some things they find normal we find a slight bit frusterating (i.e not waiting in line at dinner, just hopping in and grabbing whatever they want, and staring at people) Some people in my family had a harder time adjusting than others, again I think European vacation is more a summer thing, never noticed that many europeans when I travled over Spring break.

Never seen so much rain in my life, and this is coming from someone who lives in the perpetually soaked south Florida area! I normally stay at RIU Palace with hubby, but this trip was just a girls weekend, so I booked at the Yucatan for a change of scenery. My RIU class card got us a wonderful room in #4 with cathedral ceilings close to the pool and La Margarita. The Beach Club was flooded, the pool overflowed, rain poured in from the roofs of the show building and La Hacienda, but everyone - the guests and the staff had a great time. Staff went out of thier way to put on shows and hold games which kept everyone busy. The food was great and the drinks flowed - just like the rain. Since I have stayed at the Palace and now the Yucatan, I can attest that the food is exactly the same at both properties. The Palace is much more grand, but to tell you the truth, I wouldn't hesitate to book at the Yucatan again. Stopped into RIU Playacar to get some drinks (and dodge another massive storm) and the place was a madhouse. Folks looked misreable! I guess if you traveled half way across the globe to holiday here and your vacation was a complete washout it would be disappointing, but heck, you have to make the best of it .

The setting of the hotel was wonderful, lots of foliage, beautiful pathways throughout the property and nicely laid out. We only stayed for 3 nights and were offered an upgrade to the Riu Palace in Cancun and opted to take it to try something different. The only downside I would have to say was the rooms. They were fairly spacious but found a lot of mosquitoes in the rooms and did have a sewer odor to them. Got rid of the mosquitoes ourselves but each day there seemed to be more. Shower head was half full of calcium which made for quite a long shower and had a couple days where the hot water was shut off in the morning but the could have just been repairing something. Thought that maybe it was the room we got but the other couple we went with had the same problems. Staff were quite friendly, found they served the people at the bar who were flashing cash first. Good variety of food in both the buffet and the specialty restaurants. Beach was great. Nice deep sand, the waves were a little strong but great for body surfing. Pool was a little small and chairs were difficult to get around the pool unless you woke up early to reserve. Plenty of chairs at the beach side.

Horrible beds, disorganized service, and boring food were the downers. We stayed at the Riu Playacar the last week in April. Apple was booked up, so we used Funjet. The flight was uneventful, taking 3 hrs, 20 mins. One issue was that we were unsure about the effect the Xray machines might have on our film (He's a photographer and uses different types of film, and we also took some disposables), but security at both Midway and Cancun airports assured us that it would be safe...we'll see once we develop it! The room was nice for the most part, but had mosquitoes and was always damp and sticky--which is normal for humid Mexico, but can be uncomfortable. The fridge was nicely stocked with bottled H20, Corona and pop, and the wet bar had good hard liquor. We were on ground level and had a beautiful garden view, and it was mostly quiet (except for the occasional sounds of the drunk girls upstairs screaming and pushing furniture around at 3 a.m.). Unfortunately, the beds were TERRIBLE, as other people are pointing out. I have never (not) slept on a worse bed (yes, \"king\" size is two doubles pushed together) OR with worse pillows, OR with worse bedspreads. What were they thinking? Are the bedspreads ugly old curtains re-used from 1985? The food was mediocre as well. Buffet gets very old, and the food was pretty boring...not much authentic Mexican food, too many bland \"American\" foods. They offered a \"Steak House\" and a \"Meditteranean\" restaurant, which were o.k., though the steak wasn't of very high quality. The desserts were awesome, though, and the juices and smoothies were very refreshing. My partner was fairly satisfied with the food, but he'll eat anything. Bars were everywhere and were generous with the alcohol if it was requested. However, a new bar was just being built in the lobby, so though it was comfortable to relax and enjoy the weather and a few drinks at night, the noise and mess during the day was pretty annoying. The swim-up bar at the pool was great, and opened at 10 a.m. One big drawback was the pool closing at about 8 p.m. We would really have liked to lounge in the water with our drinks late into the evening, but they \"prepare\" the pool at night for the next day. You can sit at the pool bar at night, but you can't swim. The beach was excellent, with lots of lounge chairs and palm trees offering shade. Massages, henna tattoos, pottery painting, and water sports were offered daily. The water was amazing, and it only rained part of one day. It got crowded mid-week, but no complaints. Topless sunbathers are tolerated, and it was also reported that an elderly man emerged from the surf in his birthday suit! (Peek at your own risk, my friends.) After visiting the other Riu's, Riu Tequila and the Yucatan, we decided these hotels are superior in looks and comfort, and about equal in food quality. The verandas and lounging furniture are better, and both feel more secluded and \"jungle-y\". (We didn't see any monkeys though, which I was disappointed by.) Also, the Tequila is not oceanside, which may disappoint some, but it is very beautiful and offers a lot. We would definitely choose one of these over the Playacar if we went again. There also seemed to be more girls going topless at the Tequila resort, which some people have problems with. My advice is that if you are insecure, or are offended by bared breasts, either skip these resorts or discuss the issue with your travelmates beforehand. The shopping was disappointing, though we hear it used to be better even a few years ago. Prices are about the same, but alcohol is somewhat cheaper. We live in Chicago, so we can get most of the same stuff they have on 5th avenue for the same prices. Not too impressive for us. On the up side, it was fun to walk up and down the shopping streets near the ocean and eat homemade ice cream. We didn't drink at any bars or eat at any restaurants in town, though we would if we went again. We paid $100 to go horseback riding and \"swim\" with our horses in the ocean. \"Swimming with your horse in the ocean\" consisted of sitting in your bathing suit bareback (no saddle, in case you didn't know) while the horse was led by a guide into the water until your legs were submerged, then turning around and coming back. We were pretty disappointed, though once I considred it further, I'm not sure what exactly I was expecting. The ride itself was good (we had saddles). But, if you opt for this excursion, TAKE PANTS with you. Shorts, bathing suits, and horses DO NOT MIX. Our thighs were so raw and sore, I couldn't cross my legs. (I was wrong to think it wouldn't be so bad!) Let me also mention that the outings don't seem very organized, and the Funjet sales guys were somewhat pushy. We were pressured to sit through a presentation and sign up immediately on arrival (you must pay ahead of time when registering for trips). The trip itself was a let-down, though the ride leaders were fun. Then we were told by the Funjet guys to get on the wrong bus to come back to the hotel and we were nearly left there. Very hectic and frustrating, but it ended up o.k. because we could rest our sore buns and drink cold beers on the bus. This review is getting long, so let me just say this in summary... We felt that we might as well have vacationed Florida for less money and less hassle, though we made the best of it.

My review is listed by the good and the bad below.The Good: -Excellent Beach. Can't say enough good about this beach. Great sand. Palms for shade. Crowded in the center, but easy enough to find a secluded area at the fringes. Get there before 10 or you might have trouble getting a good spot. The ocean was the most beautiful blue with fun waves. No seaweed. -Food was good. A lot of variety for different tastes. -Bar drinks were good. Have to ask for a good liquor or you'll get the cheap stuff. I never had to wait too long at the bar, good service. Also, there's a couple Corona taps by the buffets to serve yourself. No beach bar though. Bring your own insulated plastic cups with lids. -Friendly, helpful staff. Never had a problem with service. Everyone speaks decent to good English. -The grounds were lush and jungle-like. Very pretty. Monkeys hang out in the tops of the trees. The monkeys roar like lions. Very amusing. -Playacar and downtown Playa. Playacar is a beautiful community of resorts and homes and shopping. All the RIUs are in Playacar. Very well kept grounds. Playa is a small but safe downtown a short distance from the resort. Lots of shopping, open-air restaurants and bars.The Bad: -There was a terrible sewage smell by the lunch buffet, and 2 dinner restaurants. This was just the worst. I literally had to breath through my mouth when I went to get food at lunch time. And I only ate dinner at one of the restaurants once in which a waft of terrible rotting waste would invade the dinner table every 15 seconds. Eat at the buffet for dinner to avoid this bad experience or eat in downtown Playa. -Beds were very uncomfortable. I'm not that picky when it comes to hard or soft or whatever. But these were hard as a rock and uneven. They must be old. Also, don't expect to get a king. A king is two doubles pushed together. So unless you want to sleep on a crack, you and your significant other will be sleeping in two different beds. -Little things in the rooms were not up to par. No pad of paper and pen. I couldn't leave a note for my room attendant to supply us with more beer or water. The soap sucks. Bring your own. The shower head was broken. The air conditioner and fridge weren't working the first couple of days.Overall, The Good was so good, that we ultimately had a great time. The downtown of Playa played a big part of that great time. The buffets can get old after a while, so going downtown was a treat. The restaurants have great food, great atmosphere, and are authentic. La Parilla was recommended to us and was so good, we ate there twice. Playa is very safe and is only a $5 cab ride from the resort. Next time, I'll stay at the Iberostar which is next to the Yucatan or Royal Hideaway.

The live entertainment at night, although a bit cheesy at times (Mexican rendition of Grease), it was fun and everyone really enjoyed the music and dancing.

The weather could not have been better - the only day we felt any humidity was our last day there. We had no rain - and unbelievably - there were no bugs (that was a HUGE one for me ...) It was fun to see the monkeys (but prepare yourself for the sounds they make - nothing like you've ever heard in the zoo) and tons of lizards along with some brown \"rodent\" - about the size of a small dog.

There is a \"smell\" - but nothing \"foul\" about it. Infact - as we've come across items since we've been home - we've noticed the \"smell\" - and I find myself missing it.... It was fun to shop. Infact - lay on the beach for 1 minute and the salesmen will come to you - but are quick to leave you be with a simple shake of the head - but also willing to \"negotiate\" on pricing - (and a bottle of cold Pepsi from the fridge in your room goes a long way with that dollar bill). Shopping in town was alot of fun. It was fun to barter on pricing. They'll take just about any offer - when you flash that American Dollar and threaten to walk away. I can say without a doubt that our 4 days and nites at Riu Yucatan was probably the best vacation I've been on.

Room: it's big enugh, and we had several towel sculptures. They're cleaning fine. We loved the space for the closet/vanity/shower and separate toilet area. The safe box is in the closet, and yes, it's quite big, enough for a camcorder and other valuables. They give you a key at the reception, and you're supposed to keep it with you all the time. Also, we were quite happy with the air-conditionning and the fan. And there's a fridge with soft drinks, water and Corona, as well as a mini-bar with 4 hard alcohols. The service: is just excellent. Everybody is always smiling, and all we asked for came in very fast. The restaurants: we loved the food ! It's extremely tasty, and although we thought that we can make the tour of the buffet in 2 days, every day was different. We just decided to quiet down and not put on 10+ pounds in 10 days. On your first day, you are assigned a sitting at the Hacienda for dinner. The experience may depend on who you're going to have as neighbors for the time of your stay. We usually ate at the Hacienda for breakfast and dinner, and at the Margharita at the pool, next to the beach, for lunch. Although there are less choices at the pool restaurant, it was plenty enough ! this place also is open for snacks all day. At breakfast, you can have anything you want, even very early if you're leaving for a day-trip. Twice, we prepared ourselves sandwiches because we didn't know when we're going to be able to eat. And there's always the choice of pizza/pasta/hot-dog/hamburgers for lunch and dinner, but really, the local-type of food was so good that it would be a shame not to try. We also went to teh 2 choices of sit-down dinners, at the pool restaurant. It was very good, but the Hacienda buffet is great ! You reserve for the sit-down dinner at breakfast at the Hacienda. no need to wake up at 7:00 am, really! The beach: is big and wide, but yes, you kind of have to be there before 9:00 to reserve your perfect space. by 4:00 pm, the sun is in the back, and most of the beach was in palm tree shadow. entertainment: the hotel has a lot of activities, and they are very fun. Every evening, there's a show at El Templo (at the pool too), dance, or impersonation, but generally quite good and funny. Well, don't expect Broadway, it's a resort, and it's a free show ! Bars/drinks: there are several bars. We loved La Cantina, in the lobby. The best Mohitos are there. But then, they sent the barmen to the other bars, and suddenly Mohitos became good everywhere. We liked to take some pina coladas during the day at the swim-up bar too. el Templo has a bar, of course. Excursions: we did X-Caret, Chichen Itza, Coba/Pac-Chen and Xel-Ha/tulum. All were great, but if you have a limited time, and depending of how adventourous you are, you should chose: X-Caret is quiet, with many attractions that may not demend too much skills, aviary, orchid farm, beach, and especially a wonderful show in the evening. Chitchen Itza is magnificent. You should think twice before getting up the pyramid though, there's no railing and it's scary steep. the trip also includes a stop at valladolid, a Spaniard city, and a stop at a cenote, these underground lakes, where you can go swim. Tulum is very pretty, and has a beach too - you can have a day-trip there. We mixed it with Xel-Ha, another ecological park, which is great for snorkeling. The coba/Pac-Chen may require more sporty skills, as it includes a zip-line across a lake, repelling in a cenote, and hiking. It is very different though, interessing and funny. We also did a snorkeling trip we got from Scuba caraibe, which is on the beach of every resort. it was great ! We got a disc with pictures after for $15.00 more. You can do para-sailing, diving, motorised water sports - but keep in mind that all this is at extra cost. We would definitely like to go back there !

The roads were interlocking brick!!!The food was very good and the drinks just as good.You could go to two other RIU resorts (Playacar and Tequila) so it made a two week stay easier with a little variety.Whatever resort you go to the food is the same so don't expect to get anything different from one resort to the other.The ice cream on the beach was wonderful and appreciated!The rooms were adequate and kept very clean so there was nothing to complain about but nothing to praise either.

White sand & the clearest blue sea. So we spent nearly all our time there, that was if we could get a sun lounger. You need to be quick!

We spent most of our time at the Yucatan though, so wish to comment on the service we received there. It was incredible. The bartenders were hillarious and willing to mix you up any concoctions you requested. They even let us behind the bar to share a little dance with them. The entertainment crew was unreal. Kory provided us with weeklong entertainment including beach and pool volley-ball, pub crawls to Senor Frogs in Playa del Carmen and The City in Cancun, as well as numerous dance lessons. Carlos amused us with his brightly coloured wigs and his one-liners. Although with such a large group we were destined to have a good time the experiences we shared would not have been the same without the help of these two gentlemen. I do feel that this is a resort for the younger crowd looking for a good time, but there are plenty of activities for all ages. The food was surprisingly good, but again could have used a little change once and a while. Unfortunately we had cloudly weather for the majority of our trip, but did remain on the beach for the most part as 28 degrees celcius is still much warmer than 0 degrees back home. I could go on and on, but I would like to make one comment on possibly the only problem we had and that was with house cleaning back at the Tequila. We did not have the problem, but some of our co-travellers had persistent problems with maids waking them up all the time and asking for money. It was our understanding that we would tip them out at the end and I can honestly say that I hope our friends did not give them any more money as they were constantly disrupted. In closing I would highly recommend a visit to the Yucatan to experience it for yourself and create your own opinions.

I received 1 response to my first mail telling me that they would not guarantee a room assignment. When we checked in, the clerk said she had something for us, which I assumed was the room we asked for. Instead, she said they were overbooked and she would offer a free 7 night stay at any of their hotels worldwide if we would switch to the Riu Tequila. We wanted an onsite beach, so after much discussion, we declined that offer. Then she offered an oceanfront suite at the new Riu in Cancun if we would switch to there. We declined that one too. Then she offered to let us stay in the Palace for 1 night if we would just switch for 1 night. We declined that too. If we had wanted to stay elsewhere, we would have booked elsewhere. I think as a punishment for not accepting any of their offers, we were assigned a room in building #7, which is very far from the beach. We asked to be reassigned later in the week, but they never did... The guests tended to be an older crowd than last year and very much more American and Canadian. That put a damper on the beach scene. It rained hard 2 of the 7 days we were there and was overcast and windy 4 other days. That is not the resort's fault, but they could provide some entertainment offers if the beach and pool are unavailable. They did provide free umbrellas, but a VCR or DVD player would have been nice since CNN and Fox tend to get repetitive. They did put out a tabletop blackjack table that the kids seemed to enjoy, but was kinda of weak for adults to play. The lobby bar staff is great! They always tend to be in a happy and playful mood and can make any drink. The ones at the beach bar seem to be more serious and not as personable. The entertainment was pretty good--great dancers! The M. Jackson show seemed a little weak as the vocal part was very quiet and the 'thump, thump' background was very loud. On the beach, we saw Santa Claus and a pink-haired Girl (boy). The help was slicing the end off of raw coconuts and putting straws in them. That was neat, but the milk tasted bad, and I'd read it caused 'uncomfortable bowel conditions', so we left most of ours undrank. The hot tub was never hot-just bubbling cold water. The food was very acceptable as we are not real picky and the restaurant staff was very friendly. The Mediterranean restaurant stunk of sewage at night. The horrible smell was especially prevalent throughout the resort after it rained. The meal here was not that great as 1/2 of it was 'sea snails' which was mostly an empty shell. We went into PDC for dinner one night and thought we had found a great deal. $19 for all you could eat sirloin, rib-eye, T-bone, or any of 6 other entrees. The meal consisted of a waiter coming by and cutting off a few slivers of each selection, meat after meat. My wife was sick after eating there. I'm sorry, but I can't recall the name of the place, other than the name started with an E. While in town, it was strange to see all the military out in force. Not disruptive, just odd. Anyway, this resort is great if it is not raining and you can get a room in the area you want without having to make a tough, lets-make-a-deal decision as soon as you get there.

We checked in later in the evening and the desk clerk was really nice. We had a first floor room that was small with one bed made up of 2 double beds and we also had a cot. My husband and I and my 1 daughter took the 2 double beds that were hard and my other daughter stayed on the cot which was very soft. The room was different from other places we stayed at the bathroom is separated by a curtain and the toilet is in a room by itself. my overall look at it was it was very Mexican. My daughters however loved the towel doll left on the bed and we received another one later in the week, we did not come for the room anyway. The beach was beautiful and lots of people it wasn't that hard to find beach chairs we always got one everyday. Towels are one per day and get them early because later they are gone. Usually because late check outs get them in the morning and theirs none left when you check in late. The drinks were good they always had a different one everyday as a feature. They also have popcorn and nachos with cheese all day or you can take fruit or muffins or buns from the buffet with you to the pool or beach. They had a fun kids club that my girls enjoyed, the leader King was so much fun he really kept them busy all day, which left time for my husband and me to relax and also to have a massage on the beach from one of the three massage huts. It was so nice to get a body massage on the beach at really great prices as well. The buffet is nice for breakfast lots of variety, lunch is good too. You also have a choice of 2 other buffets closer to the beach. Dinner is buffet and you have to get your dinner seating for the week or you have a choice to book a reservation at one of the two restaurants which is seafood or steak they were both good but my kids loved to have a choice at the buffet. One night they gave you champagne as you walked in and the next they had a barbeque on the terrace. They also have some people come in to sell things like a market. Taxis are only $4.oo american to 5th avenue or the area near the ferry to Cozumel, you have to go here to shop it is beautiful and lots of deals, I also recommend Xel-ha and Tulum tours they are beautiful.

We arrived late on January 30th. My party included my wife, son and my mother and father. The lobby area is well kept and has very traditional Mexican decor. My wife and I were given rooms right next to my parent?s roomThe rooms:Our room was awful and my parent?s room was even worse. Our room was the equivalent of a 1+ star. The closet door was broken -- looked like someone kicked it in. There were dead mosquitoes smashed on the walls and live ones flying around. The paint job was a joke. There was a turquoise trim and there was splattering of turquoise paint below the trim. It looked like someone drunk painted the room. The room smelled very moldy. There was no tub in the bathroom; only a shower and the bathroom was not clean. The furniture was ugly and the room was not up to par, generally speaking. Beyond that, the bed was as hard as a rock and it was two double beds pushed together, not one queen or king. My parent?s room had the same conditions and their air conditioner did not work.Both parties upgraded our rooms to the suites. These rooms were much bigger (which was nice), but the overall quality was still poor. The suites were basically two of the regular rooms separated by a curtain. One side is like a family room with tile floors and the other side is the bedroom with wood floors. The wood floors are so squeaky it's irritating. This was the same in my parent?s room as well. Once again, a smell of mold greeted you as you entered these rooms. Additionally, the suites have the same bed set up -- rock hard double beds pushed together to create one large bed. I'm not sure why the hotel didn't just purchase king beds. These rooms had tubs, unfortunately we spent two days trying to get the staff to unplug our drain so that we could take a shower or bath before we checked out early.The service:The hotel was not responsive to our request. We complained about our broken drain probably about 7 to 8 times. I honestly do not know if it got fixed because we checked out. Generally speaking the service in this hotel was poor. Unlike other all inclusives, you are not asked for food in drink when you are around the pool (not a big deal, but sometimes this is nice). The waite staff is relatively friendly, but I have seen better. The front desk personnel was awful. These people did not go out of the way to ensure our stay was a good one. In the days we were there, we dealt with one individual who had the qualities to deal with customers. The others would be better off working where they don?t need to deal with people.The food:The food was absolutely terrible. Mind you, this is something that is very subjective. To begin, the set up of how the food was arranged was awful. The buffets that they had were not well conceived. They have one long line to get food and everyone one lines up?it?s like a hog feed. They should take a look at some American buffet restaurants to get a better idea of how to set up a buffet so the arrangement is easier to actually get your food. Beyond that, the quality of the food was poor. The food was very greasy and not much thought appeared to be put into it. My wife and I would have much rather preferred to prepare our own food than to have eaten the food that was provided. We did make arrangements to go to the sit down restaurant one day (which doubles as the lunch time buffet). This set up was a little nicer as you actually get a little space to eat your food. The meal started off nice ? the appetizers were good. However, the steak was a joke. Everyone in my party looked at each other with a blank stare. The steak was piece of fat grizzle. This was not a fluke, as we had spoken to other parties who had the same experience. Mind you, if you like fat and grizzly steak, you would rather enjoy this steak.The drinks:Not much to say here. If you are a college-aged kid you would probably love the drinks. We however, are not that. Low quality drinks with cheap alcohol. I personally can enjoy a drink if it tastes well. If you want to drink to get drunk, then you will do all right at this hotel if you are willing to drink 20 drinks to do so.For kids:Not much for kids to do here, I would advise anyone with kids to seek out a different resort.Summary:We had a terrible time at this resort. Obviously an opinion is subjective and it appears that others have arrived at different conclusions. My wife and I have been on MANY vacations and both agreed that this was not only the worst, but the worst by far. If I were someone seeking out information on this hotel, I would strongly advise you to take the information I have provided into consideration. If the things I have listed above would not bother you, than you will have a great time. They bothered us and ruined our vacation.

A small sink area with whole bottles of liquor and fridge in the bathroom area. Limited closet space small drawer caddy. Shower stall was moldy and mildewy and the overhead light not working.

The next morning we complained about the room relating all the above not to mention that once you put an extra cot inthe room it was much too crowded. They told us no other room was available in our package. We asked if we could upgrade to a suite and were told for an additional 100 US dollars per night. After discussing it, we opted to do that .When my husband went back to arrange the upgrade we were told it was 100 per person a night. Well my husband lost it at that point. We were told this was a five star hotel and were not happy. Finally they agreed to upgrade us. This suite was quite roomy with a larger seperate bathroom and tub. This suite even though it was larger and better appointed was still in need of paint and new decorating. The Bathtub was all chipped and rusted. The shower head sprayed all over the place . The ceiling over the shower was moldy from the spray. The property was interesting in that the buildings were all low rise with jungle like vegetation in between. The pool is well layed out with the bar and theatre nearby. The beach was soft, large and very crowded. The food was adequate.

The Playacar had a much nicer pool and the staff seemed more involved. On our trip there were many more young Americans at the Playacar. But, beacause of the \"play at 3\" policy we walked over a couple of days and really were able to enjoy all of the resorts. The Tequila was beautiful with an awesome pool and the Hot nightclub. If you don't mind a short walk or tram ride to the beach(you can use the facilities at the Yucatan or Playacar while at the beach) you can't go wrong with the Tequila. Overall, we were very happy with the RIU resorts. They all had a wonderful staff and clean well kept amenities. Beaches are gorgeous. All are within an easy walk of each other and a short cab ride to town. (if you walk, the road is an easier trip than the beach and will take about 1 hour) Each has a bit of a different feel to them but if you are considering or have booked at RIU just relax, you will be pleased.

We were blessed with awesome weather that week--hotter than hell. The town itself was typically Mexican--herd the tourists into a nicer area, but looks a bit run down away from the core, but still safe enough.

The bull in the entry way is gourgeous and the inside with the \"tiny\" gift shops hold alot~I requested my gifts at the front desk and got them on the fourth day I was there. I didnt know anything about that until I got there and to be honest I didnt fly all the way there to whine about not getting it-that was the last of my concern. They presented us with a beautiful gift basket of fresh fruit and a poster of Mexico by a very talented local artist. The beds were a bit stiff, but after being in the hot sun~think 95 degrees with a heat index of 115~you were tired-so I was happy with just having a place that was airconditioned to sleep. There isnt any \"pay per view\" channels but if that was what you came for then you need to go home and pay for it there. They had a few american channels that played alot of reruns-but again I was there for the food, the entertainment, the bar staff and swim up pool was cool. Yes, the pool is hot, but its situated outdoors and is going to be with the sun basking on it all day~if you get your butt out of bed and head down after breakfast its just right! My room was stocked with all kinds of drinks and alcohol, the maids did a very good job cleaning-even making animals out of the towels and leaving them on our bed. I had no trouble with the drains in the shower or nor did I have any other problems. Of course you cant touch the monkey's they are wild animals. They are not brought it for amusement-they are actually wild and just happen to show up every once in awhile-the hotel staff told me that-they allow you to film them-but I woldnt be a village idiot and try to stick my hands up and touch them-you deserve to get your fingers chewed off! There is plenty to do with suba diving in the clear blue ocean, target practice, gym area for the kids, jet skies, snorkeling, volleyball, water aerobics etc. Yes, they have entertainment, that doesnt change very often, as they have the same show that lasts a week but they have the disco area for dancing. You are allowed to venture to the other RIU hotels for activites and food-if you cant handle staying on your resort and want something new.

We have previously stayed in the Mayan Riviera at the Barcelo Maya and wanted to come back. We could not beat the price for the RIU Yucatan. The resort was nice, but not five star. More like 3.5. The drive up to the front of the resort was not spectacular. It features a metal, bronzed bull with a horse shoe in front of it. The lobby is not fancy, but does have a Mexican flair. The lobby contains two very small gift shops, a small bar, couches and chairs (to relax and visit in), and the main buffet restraunt. The buffet restraunt was very large. Like entering a huge building. Table clothes and plastic flowers in vases on each table. The tables are placed incredibly close to one another and do not allow for much intimacy, except with the rest of the guests. The hall, or building have large vents on the ceiling for air-conditioning. My husband and I chose to eat outside, much quiter and romantic (also no air-conditioning). When you first arrive at the hotel you have to tell the matride' which time you wish to dine. You can choose either 7 or 9 pm. This was a total bummer, because many times we left the resort to shop or excursion and could not guarantee to be back by our 7 pm time slot. They frown on you if you don't arrive at your required time. Had no problems booking with any of the other two restaurants. The steak house was good, but chose to return to the buffet. There are many foods to choose from and they are good for all-inclusive. Many of the plates appear dirty with specks of food from previous use. Just don't think about it too much and enjoy your meal. The waiters were nice and helpful. The room itself was nice, medium size. The shower was slow to drain. The T.V.'s do not offer any type of pay movies. What ever is on the local channels is what you are going to be watching. The beds are very hard (no box spring), but were doable. There are great massage deals on the beach if you should wake up with a sore neck or back. The balconies are nice and overlook the jungle where monkies will jump from tree to tree. You can't touch the monkies as they stay up quite high. The pool appeared dirty, not very clear (cloudy, but blue). The pool was almost hot. I love to swim, but was not tempted to get into the pool. Instead I found myself in the ocean. The water is incredible and the beach is soft white sand. No sea life in the water at all. If you are hoping for even a small reef or series of rocks, forget it. Sand out to the deep blue. I did see a barracuda one day, but never saw him again. Did see little silver fish very infrequently and do not represent what you would see in a reef or rock area. Waves can get medium sized, great for body surfing. This really is a wonderful swimming beach and you will not need water boots (pure sand, no rocks). The entertainment was lacking and very repetitious. Perhaps tequila boomboom's will make the show more exciting. Every night they played the song \"We are the Champions\", and everyone sang a song that said, \"I love soga\"! I was told this means more dancing, or more partying. Who knows, but really who cares? The resort is small and was extremly crowded when we went. It was impossible to find a chair on the beach. Not a romantic resort by any means. All Europeans, this is not bad. We loved the area, but would not go back. Would recommend checking out the Iberostar Tucan. We walked over to that resort and were blown away with it's beauty and size.

When we got there, there were no gifts. I told the front desk. The next day we come back to the hotel, still no gifts. We told the front desk again the next day. We had to speak to the PR person before they finally sent our gifts. That was the 4th day I think. Wasn't too thrilled about that.

They gave us new remote but I don't think they ever fixed our shower 'coz it was still draining slow throughout our stay. Another negative. Hotel has three restaurants. We mostly ate at the buffet. Food's not bad but after eating the same thing for several days, you look for something new. We did eat at the Steakhouse one night. You have to reserve for that one and the Seafood restaurant. Couldn't wake up early enough to reserve for another night. Tip the waiter in the buffet, your 2 dollars will go a long way. He will get your drinks for you and will basically give you outstanding service. I had diarrhea for one day and felt really sick. TIP: Stay away from the fruit juices. We went to several places on this trip: Tulum, XPU-HA, Xcaret, Cozumel. Did some reef snorkeling the second day. Too bad we didn't get to go to Chichen Itza. My wife really wanted to go there.

There are 4 optics with assorted white alcohol also situated in the bathroom..we did not touch them as the food & drink is poured down you all day & night...we did drink the coronas & the sodas which are replenished every second day. Now to the food. On arrival you are allocated a permanent seat in the buffet dining room at either 7pm or 9pm. For lunchs & breakfasts you choose the buffet in the main reception area or 1 of the 2 restaurants by the pool with open seating. The food is excellent in every option. The buffet dinner has everything for every taste, from from full on Mexican cuisine to freshly grilled fish dishes, amazing pastas, duck, roast pork, vegetarian dishes, salads, cold meats, deserts hot & cold...I could go on and on!!! If you fancy a meal with 4 courses and thankfully no extras, you can opt for either the Margarita Steak House or the Beachclub fish restaurant situated by the pool. There are 4 selected dinners in each & these do not change. You need to book these early (between 7 to 7.30 am on the morning you wish to dine) We found them a welcome respite to the buffet....this is a complement, no matter what we said , we always ended up going back for \" just a taste\". I highly recommend the sirloin & the surf & turf in the Steakhouse & the grilled grouper in the Beachclub. The pool facilities are perfect, there is a punge pool as an extra & a swim up-bar. We didn't use the pool after about 11am as it was too warm and opted instead to swim in the Carribbean...no matter what you here everytime you see its colours, it takes you breath away! BIG TIP. Take some bread from the lunch buffets & wade in to your waste, throw some bread around and wait.....soon there will be up to 8 inch angel fish surrounding you in a feeding frenzy, they will eat from you hands, it is absolutely amazing. There is very little else to say...yes you will see the odd spider monkey in the trees, and there are iguanas everywhere. The shows at night are good fun & the laughs at the bar are plenty. Bring some dollar bills to tip the bar tenders as they work so hard and will provide you with what ever you heart desires. Watch out for the salsa barbecue on the beach on saturdays and just sit back and enjoy!!!", "Date": "July 23, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cWe had a great Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1143390", "Content": "We were at the Riu Yucatan from Jue 23 to June 30th and we had a great time!!!

We were disappointed with the lack of authentic mexican cuisine. The thing that bothered us the most was the lack of air conditioning in the main dining area. The fact that men are required to wear long pants and then are subjected to the heat while eating is irresponsible. This rule needs to be changed. Be careful if you use Expomarketing to be book your weekly activities. Our representative lied to us about a trip to Chitchen Itza telling us there would be swimming in a beautiful cenote when in fact we not able to swim in it at all. The only other problem we had with the RIU is the front desk. They have a policy of not giving you anything but pesos in exchange for travelers checks and they would not do a cash advance for a Visa.

It was awful, the worse vacation experience ever. 5 star all-inclusive hell. The staff, and there were plenty, were rude, ignorant, extremely un-knowledgeable and could not do enough to offend you. They just laugh in you face. To begin with there were no rooms available for us. Weve been told that they are overbooked and we have to check in later. Weve been waiting first on the porch, under the rain and then in the lobby for hours. There was no storage room available for us to leave our luggage until they will found where to place us. We requested in advance 3 rooms close to each other and it took us 2 days to get our accommodation. It was much worse with the dinner setting. There were no tables available for us in the half-empty restaurant for 5 days. We agreed to eat outside, but every day our seats were assigned to other guests. We learned to go for the breakfast and lunch in pair, because as soon as you put your plate on the table and went to get something else (coffee or spoon) it will be promptly taken away by ever rotating staff. Its looks like they only goal was to kick you out. We never learned the beach towel rules. It were 3 different timetables in different sources, but bottom line is bring you own. They either dont have them anymore, or its too early or too late, or you already use your one towel per day limit. Its a great place for people who are only interested in to get drunk. We have 2 teens with us and all my attempts to limit the alcohol supply to their room were refused. 13 years old have been served drink in all bars all the time unlimited!!! We will never return to this smelly rusty place. Even to get out wasnt easy. We checked out at noon, went to the beach and came back to the common shower to discover that there is no towel or hot water available. Our shuttle was almost an hour late and Resort staff has no idea what to do. They were kind enough to connect us to the SunTrips representatives who kept us on hold until weve seen the bus pulling in. My back still hurt from pushing the bags through the lobby into this airport shuttle. It was no any bellboy in sign to help us.

Its located on a zone of about 10-15 hotels at the most. The beach/water is breath taking!! Along w/this hotel RIU has sister hotels - tequila (located across the street from Yucatan not on the beach/water) & RIU Playacar next to Yucatan & finally RIU palace. All of the three you have access to in walking distance. The palace you can't enter unless you have special arrangements. We didn't try to enter it very pretty looking from the outside. We had breakfast once @ the Playacar and didn't care so much for the small selection & the taste of their food. I have been to playa car four times and the food @ the Yucatan is the best Ive ever had! The chefs are the best - cuisine food. The staff at Yucatan are so friendly --Laura especially @ the main bar by the pool. They called us by are names as I make friends w/the person on the elevator. Remember to tip these hard working people. Its an all-inclusive hotel but please remember they don't get any of the money. And they bust their butt's for all of us while we're having fun in their country. Walking distance to town or a taxi $4.00 one-way. Blue Parrott nightclub and Senor Frogs & Tutix are located on the beachfront. All three are located down at the bottom of the roads towards the beach. The 4 tacos @ blue parrot are to be tasted along with baked potato w/melted cheese which was cooked on the grill. Yummy! And cheap $4.00 oh and a bowl of awesome beans.;-) Take the ferry to Cozumel and shop over there cheaper jewelry & merchandise. For snorkeling Ive been to chakanaab state park. No more than $10.00 ea, from Cozumel to the park in taxi $10.00. They have rental equip. But I have my own. Along with a couple of restaurants and a maze like ruins to walk thru pretty nice w/shops in their too. I stayed @ Viva Maya hotel which was very nice too a four star rating & Ive stayed @ hotel Principe which was too big 800 rooms I believe and to far from everything, located by itself. Boring, and the beac not as pretty as on the zone. By far the Riu's are my number one choice. Although the pool bottom is peeling and should be painted which gives the pool a not so clean like pool, I only went in it everyday for the aqua aerobics which was great!! The rooms were awesome. Make sure you don't get stuck next to the stage as our friends requested to be moved to much noise. I could go on about so much more. The occidental Playacar was what we paid for and found out to our shock as we got to the airport they didn't have any room for us!! I speak Spanish thankfully and went to the hotel and found out that about five other couples from Huston we're from Chicago area didn't have a room either. I was very frightened that I didn't know where we'd be staying. They wanted to put us up at a hotel off the beachfront. No way!!!!! So we wound up @ RIU from this. I wrote our reps and am still working out this nightmare. We feel it as fraud and false advertisement that someone took are money for this hotel and then didn't have a room for us. We walked the beach and went on this property they were renovating it the rooms looked so small and very ugly. Thankfully we bought the insurance always buy insurance for any unforeseen reason. For what purpose it may serve I will fight this even if I have to get an attorney. We lost 1/2 a day and the stress it caused was not pleasant.

The food was very good, although, I was a little disappointed that there was not a bigger selection of Mexican food, other than that, the Fish the steak....excellante! The bartenders and service were absolutely wonderful. We did tip the gentlemen who stocked our room fridge and he made sure it was full of Corona, Pepsi and Water everyday. The staff is very extremely helpful and made sure you were taken care of. The bartenders work their tails off and are a lot of fun. Make sure you ask for an extra shot of liquor and they will make sure you will have it everytime. Israel and Gaspar at the front bar in the lobby are great to mess with. The entertainment staff by the pool were very friendly and do a great job. Miaka left Germany after vacationing with her family to the Riu and is now working at the hotel for 6 months with the entertainment staff. There is a show everynight at the hotel, don't expect Broadway, but it's something to do and something to look at when you're drinking at the bar. We met a lot of people, but not many people from the States. A lot of people from the UK, Holland and Australia. For those of you that are not used to topless beaches and men wearing speedos....prepare yourself....there is a lot of it!!!!!! My husband was in heaven. Don't forget your cups and your huggies and your collapsable cooler. The cooler is nice if you're sitting on the beach, you can bring the beer, water and soda from your room along. The beach is absolutely gorgeous!!!! The white sand and crystal blue water....breathtaking and big. We never had a problem finding chairs on the beach...the pool was a different story. If you want to sit by the pool, get there early and put your towels down....like 7:00am, otherwise, you're not going to get a good seat. The pool was a little small, but who cares when you have that beautiful beach. We went to Cozumel for a day and did a snorkeling trip...it was okay...me and do something else. Cozumel has some nice shopping, plus Hard Rock and Senor Frogs...that's about it. We went horseback riding and you ride the horses on the beach and then they let you gallop them and then take turns riding them in the water. That was cool, but there were way to many people and it was very nerve racking. We had a trip booked to Coba, but we had to much Tequila the night before and we missed that one...oops! Do yourself a favor and take at least one day/night to go to town on Playa Del Carmen and go to dinner. We went to the Blue Lobster, which was fabo, but there were tons of cute nice restaurants that I really would have loved to try. It is really fun down there...fun bars, cute shops....it's worth it! Yes, we did see monkeys in the trees and I saw a huge aguana over at the Riu Tequila, so they are there!!!!! I took so many pictures of the monkeys, my husband thought I was nuts!!!!

Very nice resort and all the good things mentioned in earlier reviews about the resort are true. Great tropical grounds w/ monkeys, very clean, no bugs, excellent staff, fantastic beach, rooms didn't smell. The only problems were with what you may expect at the resort. When you arrive try to stay in building #4 or #5, these are the closest to the beach and pool, buildings #7 and #8 are furthest away. The walk isn't bad and the grounds are beautiful, but it gets pretty hot and very humid. Also, ask for a lock for the room safe when you check in because there is not enough locks for every room and they run out. You'll have to wait till the next day when someone checks out to get one and carry your money around till then. The only places air conditioned besides your room are the buffet and the disco. There are ceiling fans every where and they do help, but its gets hot. The buffet is ok, breakfast is the best, lunch is ok, dinner isn't that great. The mixed drinks are strong enough, but the blended ones are a little weak ( ask for \"mas\" (more) alcohol ) and the bartenders will accommodate you. Pool is an decent size but the bottom needs to be redone; swim up bar is kinda small. What I am trying to say that the Riu Yucatan is a very nice vacation resort to stay at as long as you have not been spoiled by staying at more elegant resorts. A few years ago I stayed at the Marriott Casa Maga in Cancun, now that was elegant, but then again it was also expensive. The Riu Palace next door is a very elegant resort, if your accustomed to staying at places like that then pay the extra money and stay at the Riu Palace, if not then I'm sure you will still enjoy the Riu Yucatan.
