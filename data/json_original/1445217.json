The rooms are clean and efficient though many have no windows whatsoever (I think that only the Transit Hotel's double rooms have windows). The front desk staff is not particularly welcoming but they are efficient. What I did find objectionable and hence my low rating is that there is neither a WiFi nor a LAN connection for the Internet in any of their rooms. This boggles my imagination as Singapore is certainly one of the most wired places on the planet. Changi Airport does have free WiFi (though in 12 hour increments) but it doesn't penetrate the rooms of the Transit Hotel. I only discovered the no Wi Fi after checking in (and, as you must pre-pay, you're cooked). Possessed still of a New Yorker's temperament, I objected strongly to this in an airport hotel in Singapore and they acknowledged it is their #1 complaint. Their excuse -- and I think a weak one --- was that the corridors of Terminal 3's Transit Hotel are so angular that a router wouldn't distribute the signal well. Given the cost of multiple routers I see this as a feeble cop-out so if you need to Skype or email late at night, don't stay in this hotel. To be fair, you can hump your notebook or iPad to the lobby (check-in area) of the hotel and get a weak signal from Changi Airport itself. Given the money the Transit Hotel charges, this oversight is deliberate and causes me to give them a mighty low rating.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cCan work out quite expensive.\u201d", "Author": "StevePerrott", "ReviewID": "UR128205900", "Content": "The Transit Hotels at Changi Airport Singapore are excellent places to overnight between flights.

This is sound advice since even as I checked in people were dozing around the lounge area waiting for rooms to become free. Potential customers were turned away and I overheard a receptionist say T2 was also full. And this was a quiet late Saturday evening. My single room had two beds and a small desk with tea/coffee making facilities. The room itself was clean and modern, but otherwise unremarkable. Previous reviewers mentioned hard beds; but I found it firmly comfortable and had no trouble sleeping whatsoever. Neither was a lack of windows a problem for me. The rooms are extremely well insulated: you cannot hear a thing from outside, even the A/C unit was imperceptible. The wall-mounted TV reception was clear, but limited to only about six channels or so. Still, the idea is to get much needed sleep, not to ponder the decor or watch TV - and on that score this hotel hits the mark perfectly. The bathroom only has a shower stall - no bath - but it was scrupulously clean and the water pressure was strong enough to wake the senses. Toiletries are limited - liquid soap at the washbasin and shower is via a wall-mounted dispenser - but no toothpaste! However, there is a chemist nearby to purchase your own toiletries, if you wish. I found their rates quite reasonable considering the lack of alternatives airside. There is another hotel 'outside', but you have to clear C & I and then collect your baggage.

If you travel to Australia / New Zealand via Changi airport, then I urge you to stay here. Travelling non stop is pure torture especially with small children. The rooms are spacious and the most recent room we stayed in had an adjoining door. We had small children with us so the room we had was huge with a little alcove to put our bags, sit down and blow dry our hair etc. The room already had a king bed and single bed and a baby cot were all ready for us we arrived at the hotel. We just walked up to the Mezzanine and booked in (it's located near the passport control in the airport so be careful not to leave the main terminal building as it could easily happen particularly if you're sleep deprived). It was a fight to get into the shower but because it was so large it could have easily accommodated a family. The bathroom itself was large. There was a flatscreen TV with various programmes including some kids programmes but to be honest we were all so tired that we just slept as soon as our heads hit the pillows. There were no windows in this room so the room was pitch black which helped the kids get to sleep. We try and book the rooms for about 14-16 hours to allow enough time to eat, get washed, sleep, re-pack our hand luggage for the remainder of our long journey and eat. The reception team have your flight details and can organise a wake up call for you if you need one. After you check out, you can also leave your luggage at reception while you go eat. Rooms are charged on an hourly rate but it is so worth it for what you get. Large room, immaculately clean, dark and quiet. What more could you ask for! Eatery / food hall right outside the entrance to this hotel (mezzanine level) so you don't even have to go far to eat local cuisine or fast food.

I was in two minds whether to book a room at the Ambassador T3, or 'camp out' on one of the terminal's lounge chairs. At SG$15 per hour I thought the hotel expensive, but against this weighed up the cost of lost belongings if they were to be stolen whilst I slept in the open terminal. I didn't want the hastle of clearing immigration and staying in town; then having to clear security to re-enter the terminal. So I decided to take a room for 10 hours. I was irritated by the booking in procedure that required residential details same as if I were booking in to a hotel outside the terminal... especially when required to pay up front instead of checkout. But the process only took a few minutes and I was given the key (a proper key not a key card) to my room. The corridors to the rooms were a bit of a warren - lots of signs telling you which way to the lobby but not so many directing you to your room. The room itself was windowless, but clean albeit basic. Ample space, nice shower, and firm yet comfortable double bed. Only half a dozen chanels on the wall mounted flat screen TV for anyone who might wish to spend their time viewing instead of sleeping. Tea and coffee making facilities provided. If you needed a razor, comb, toothbrush etc you had to ask the reception and these were provided free. Soap, shampoo, and shower cap only provided as standard in the room. A few metres from the lobby on the same level (adjacent to Burger King) was a convenience shop so if you needed any toiletries or deodorants etc they were available reasonably priced. No wifi/internet in the rooms either - the reception said it wasn't working in the rooms although once in the room there was a flyer to tell you that internet was available at charge. Elsewhere in the terminal the wifi is free. Seems a shame that could not be extended to the rooms for free also. Was it worth it? Yes.

The rooms were of a size commensurate with 3 star standards although the bathroom was probably a little bigger. There were drawn curtains along one wall which gave the illusion of there being a window, which helped with the overall impression of the spotlessly kept, smart interior.

Being able to stay within an airport is sometimes far preferable to passing through immigration and baggage checks, and then having to repeat that effort the next day on check-in. The hotel in terminal three is a simple affair, but it is more than adequate for a short or overnight stay. There is no room service, no fancy toiletries but you have a clean and incredibly convenient location - it was only a three minute walk to my gate the next morning. Sometimes it is possible to hear the departure of planes, so it may cause problems if you are a light sleeper. My room had a window that overlooked the tarmac, and was able to see an Airbus A380 parked directly outside of my room - splendid! The hotel informed me that they can accept bookings as soon as you have a confirmed airline reservation. I would suggest doing this as during my check-out a young family arrived wishing to stay but were turned away due to being fully booked. The forlorn look on their faces said it all as they now needed to find a spot within the terminal to rest instead. A suggestion to anyone flying with Singapore Airlines or Silk Air is to make use of their check-in services 48 hours prior to a flight. Arriving the night before an early-mid morning flight allows you to check-in, grab a meal in one of the restaurants, and then head to the hotel. Waking up the next morning at a respectable hour, it is an easy journey to the gate. This is preferable to shortening your sleep in order to travel to the airport to go through the usual departure procedures. I also stayed at the Crowne Plaze Changi Airport a couple of weeks earlier and can make the following comparison. If price is everything, then stay at the Transit Hotel, if comfort is your primary goal, head to the Crowne.

The hotel rents out in blocks of 6 hours. it is on the 3rd level of Terminal 3 across from transfer counter B. Take the skytrain to Terminal 3 before you clear immigration and customs. The check in process was quick and simple. The rooms are small, basic with no window and a small bathroom. It was clean and good enough for a few hours rest. If you are going to be out you may want to check in after you return. We made the mistake by paying for 6 hours which we spent in town! We checked in, freshened up and since we did not need a visa to see Singapore we spent a few hours site seeing. There is a free 1/2 day tour into Singapore but the last one leaves at 3pm so we missed that. You can take Bus # 36 from the airport basement after you clear customs. The bus needs exact change so get it before you exit. It is rather slow (too many stops) but we enjoyed seeing the city. If you get off at Raffles Ave you are right by the newly opened Helix bridge and museum (a must see) and the Marina Bay mall. From there it is a long walk to Clark Quay and a short walk to Glutton bay for good, cheap food. You can also take the MRT green line, get off at Tanah Merah and take the red/purple line to city hall or Raffles place. Then a long walk to Clark Quay or Raffles ave. If you like chilli/pepper crab, Jumbo seafood is a must but it is pricey and there is a long wait. There are 2 around Clark Quay. The Changi airport is open 24 hours so you can come in late and go through immigration to get back to the hotel. There are lots of food places on the 2nd floor in the transit area as well if you don't want to go into town.

Pros: Rooms are nice and spacious, clean, comfortable and peaceful. Not sure about the location of the other hotels in other terminals, but the terminal 3 hotel was close to a cinema, shops and cafes and a butterfly house. Cons: If you want to leave the terminal you have to go through immigration and can only go out once and come back in once. So once you are out, you are out.

Very reasonable price and I enjoyed my stay there more than the 8 nights at my hotel in Thailand!!", "Date": "September 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cJust the perfect rest between long haul flights\u201d", "Author": "Jcp744", "ReviewID": "UR38553086", "Content": "What can I say: blackout curtains, cant hear the planes, refeshing shower, comfy bed, tea/coffee in room, located within the terminal for the ultimate convinence, If you have a stop over for around 6 hours, do yourself a favour book it as it beats the airport chairs, you can sleep and wash and generally be in a good mood for the next gruelling long haul flight!", "Date": "August 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Australia", "Title": "\u201cmakes economy flights bearable\u201d", "Author": "magsrich", "ReviewID": "UR38193461", "Content": "Stayed for a 5 hour block between longhaul flights LHR to SYD, We had caught the A380 SQ flight to Singapore after a long day of sightseeing, so although the 380 is very good we were so tired and hadnt really slept much on the 12 hour flight, this was so convenient just a few minutes walk from the plane and we were in the queue to checkin, staff were efficient but busy.

After hours in cramped conditions in the plane and with another longer flight ahead it was great to be able to stretch out and relax after enjoying the luxury of a hot shower. The facilities are excellent for the purpose with the normal tea and coffee making facilities, television etc but the main need halfway through a flight is to be able to lie flat and relax with the confidence that if you do go to sleep there is a wake up call.

We were going to try the private sleeper rooms in Singapore Airline's First Class lounge, but read that they were more like lounge chairs not beds. Opted for the T3 Transit hotel for 6 hours instead. It was perfect. We showered before and after sleeping and after almost 5 hours of sleep, we felt like it was a whole new day- not just a long layover overnight. Bed comfortable. Location is so close we almost missed it. It was literally above gate that we just deplaned from. Our room #362 had a wall of glass that you can look right down on the people deplaning- and to outside planes parked at gates. Curtains make it dark. Room looked brand new and clean. Smelt new. Large shower with EASY TO USE controls- NO THINKING-no messing with knobs and levers in the middle of jetlag night. Great water pressure. Several towels. Soap and shampoo are in little packets- enough for several showers. Only gripe is there was only one tiny bar of soap so it was hard to wash myself in shower- shower gel needs a buff puff thingy. TIP- bring one of those buff puffs in your carry on in a plastic bag- also bring toothbrushes. We got ours from the plane. Also need deodorant. Remember, your bags are checked all the way through so you won't see them. -Wake up call had a reminder 15 minutes later- nice touch. -Great price for what you get. NIce flatscreen TV on wall. -Noise level was okay- could hear announcements faintly. Skimpy towels.

It was also very quiet considering there must have been people coming and going all the time - we never heard anyone else at all.
