Got a good rate from a hotel site, hence decided to give it a try. Besides, I knew the restaurant is top rate. Must say that I am glad I did. The hotel is in a quiet residential area at Av Tibidabo. So no shops around, but if you want to get away noise of the city, it's a good retreat. Rooms are comfortable and nicely designed. The bathroom is really cool: a jacuzzi tub with mood lighting and separate showers and a one way glass mirror through which one can look into the bedroom (but not the other way). Service is friendly and personal. Although she speaks little English, the lady who serves breakfast every morning is so sweet. Food is superb: both creative and tasty. I suggest going for the tasting menu. I probably wouldn't recommend this to someone who's in Barcelona for the first time because of the location.

When I saw all of the positive feedback on this small boutique hotel I knew I had to try it. The reviews were accurate, to say the least. The small hotel (15 rooms) is wonderfully appointed, in a really lovely neighborhood, steps away from public transportation but a really nice walk to many places. The staff members focus on the guests, showing the details of the hotel and making sure your needs are met - even before you arrive. They know who you are (including the bar tender whom I had never seen before!) and they take pride in making sure you want for nothing. I was there on a Monday so I knew I would not be able to try the restaurant, but I plan to return with my husband and we will make a reservation. I travel a lot, and stay in many hotels. When I returned, I told my husband that ABaC was one of the nicest hotel experiences I have had. It was a combination of the really lovely hotel, the service, the amenities.... I really liked the rain shower, although it is a little challenging (in the room type I as in) to open the shower, turn on the water to get warm and not get the water all of the floor. Not an issue for me, but I thought I would point that out. Barcelona is one of my favorite cities and I love to visit. I am so glad that I have found the right hotel, and will go back again.

From their AWESOME manager, Marien Inigo-Schneider (she is ALL about aiming to please, will not put up with incompetence and, I suspect, never sleeps!), to their front desk staff (Christina and other very capable and helpful colleagues), to the young, 2-Michelin Star chef, Jordi Cruz (a guest hallway runs right through the ABaC kitchen where you can witness this amazing restaurant in action and say hello to Jordi himself!), THIS is the hotel to stay in Barcelona. While this place is a short cab ride away from downtown Barcelona, take the Metro -- it is cheap, clean, safe, quick and enjoyable. Both the taxi stand and station are right across the street from the hotel. As for noise, there is none: ALL the windows are soundproof at the hotel, and you don't hear a sound from a minimal amount of traffic that runs by the hotel (the hotel itself is located in a nice, residential area of Barcelona). While there were some issues with the hotel being a bit too modern for its own sake (limited individual light controls, slightly complicated TV system, and some suite layouts have the bedroom before the living room area such that room service becomes somewhat awkward if you want to stay in the \"privacy\" of your own bed), this hotel is excellent, and I would highly recommend it to anyone seeking to stay in Barcelona. LOTS of hidden and well placed closet and drawer space so as not to leave you stressing over having a room with luggage laying around. NOTE: you must ask for \"hand towels\" if you want washcloths (it's a language issue, I think), and for a full pot of coffee (not hot water to dilute the strong coffee provided) if you are a big coffee drinker. In short, they were GREAT at meeting our many requests and attempting to understand \"American\" oddities (such as the large pots of strong coffee).

Since the hotel premise was locked, we actually had difficulty checking in at 1300. This was due to a malfunction of the doorbell at both entrances. The staff were super apologetic about the incident and from there our stay was good. We stayed in the Superior Room with our own large private balcony. The balcony square footage might have been bigger than the room itself. The bathroom had a separate bath with rain shower. And when I say rain shower I mean a 2 ft x 2 ft gush of water coming down from the ceiling! We did have some difficulty figuring out how to adjust the temperature, but once that was resolved it was heaven. We ate at the newly upgraded 2 Michelin star restaurant and it was absolutely divine. I have eaten at many Michelin rated restaurants, including the 3 star Per Se in New York and the ABAC restaurant might have been out best dining experience ever. In addition to the whimsical delicious food, the restaurant was able to fully accommodate my girlfriend's dietary restrictions. We only had one minor gripe that ironically has to do with the heavy sound-proofing of the hotel. The heavy and numerous doors that it takes to get to your room really isolate the sound well, however, they slam and make a loud noise after each one is opened. This means that when another guest leaves their room, especially with at an adjacent floor, we hear every door slam on their way out. I don't know how much the hotel can do to fix this but again it's just a minor detail.

The hotel has modern decor, friendly and efficient staff, a cool lounge and a small and excellent Michelin-starred restaurant. The breakfasts are fantastic, served by a wonderful lady - Pila(?) of Pamplona is one of those true gems that you can strike in a small hotel - and we unreservedly recommend the lightly poached egg on a base of cheese, bread crumb and potato gratin. Coffee was served without request and always as preferred - another sign of a great hotel and staff. The ABaC is not perfect - not enough towels in the room, the lounge / bar was a bit disorganized, the spa is just average and the room shower and toilet are a bit too trendy / gloomy. That said, this is one of the best small hotel experiences we have had. ABaC is located slightly out of town, although don't let this put you off - the tourist bus and Metro leave from right outside the gated walls of the hotel. Despite the busy roads surrounding the hotel, the rooms are brillliantly quiet due to good double glazing and the ultra modern appliances (B&O tv and Nespresso machine) really suit the decor. The rain-shower is a nice touch in the bathroom. Dinner in the hotel was excellent - not cheap of course, although not ridiculous - a must do experience. We left the wine selections to the sommelier and he produced some great and unusual wines by the glass. Overall the ABaC is well worth experiencing.

To start with the more positive side of ABAC, i can tell you that it is a pretty property, and it really feels exclusive due to it having only 15 rooms and a very posh restaurant. We had 2 rooms and they were both beautiful and comfortable. The breakfast was very very good. It is served every morning by the same non English speaker lady, but she is so nice and attentive it doesnt really matter. We had dinner at the restaurant one evening to celebrate my birthday and the tasting meal was excellent and very creative and the service was also excellent, as it should be for a EUR150 per person meal, not including alcohol. For the less positive side, The showers in both our rooms had a far from good water pressure and they have a design error that makes the water leak from the shower inside the bathroom. They don't have a policy of a bell boy in the entrance. When you arrive - no one is there to welcome you and to help with your bags / shopping bags. The location is not central at all and you need a 10 min taxi drive to go to or back to the hotel. But to top it all, were these two service related incidents that really showed me the true colors of this hotel and its dissapointing service. The hotel did not acknoledge that it was my birthday in any way and did nothing at all to make this special day memorable for me. Our party had two rooms booked for 3 nights each, we spent over a EUR1000 at the restaurant and nothing at all. And when i checked in i asked the lady to charge a different card then the one i made the reservation with. She took the new card number and assured me it was done. Of course at check out i found out that this was not done and that the wrong card was charged. This took way too much time - and attitude - to correct. The dealing with Marien the hotel manager was not pleasant, and she didn't take responsibility for their error. So this is not a true class act.

Ours was brought to our terrace complete with table linen and everything we needed.

We had this room booked for half our stay and to make it even more perfect, Maria offered us an upgrade to this room as it was simply available for the rest of our visit. You feel simply relaxed and spoilt here. After a day of shopping, sight-seeing, eating and drinking there is a tranquil thermal spa to return to and unwind at no extra cost...you feel a million miles from the hustle of the city. The hotel, rooms and bathrooms are a design success and part of the city's architectural genius. The Michelin starred restaurant at the ABaC was a master piece and definitely worth a visit if staying here or not. Some of the best food we have experienced and reminiscent of Ramsays Royal Hospital Road in London. If looking for a luxury hotel... the ABaC is a must!!", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Wonderful!\u201d", "Author": "GEMD_1996", "ReviewID": "UR113946357", "Content": "We stayed at ABaC for 4 nights in March 2011 and had an amazing experience. We booked the hotel based upon the fabulous reviews that we read here on TripAdvisor.com and were not disappointed. We appreciated that the hotel was conveniently located to the metro and bus lines, making sight-seeing very easy! We also appreciated that the hotel was outside the busy city center and we did not have to contend with the busy city traffic and noise -- yet found restaurants, transporation and markets within easy walking distance. We booked our Penthouse Suite room through SLH.com and were able to take advantage of a off-peak rate + a 4th night free. Our accomodation surpassed all of our expectations and the staff of the ABaC was absolutely excellent!!!! We thoroughly enjoyed every moment of our stay -- from the comfortable king size bed, to the lovely roof-top deck and jaccuzi, as well as the sun-deck chairs, outdoor table/chairs, waterfall shower and spa tub. We also enjoyed a room service meal -- delivered promptly to our room for our enjoyment on the roof-top deck/patio by moonlight. Our only regret, was that we had not allowed more days to stay at the ABaC and enjoy the spa + roof-top breakfast. The staff made wonderful recommendations for dinner, like Dos Palillos, and were able to book events, such as a Spanish Guitar concert, with ease. We also enjoyed dinner in the ABaC restaurant on our final night of our stay -- which exceeded all of our expectations and was a wonderful gastronomic experience ... service, food and wine were all absolutely fabulous!! Thank you ABaC for making our stay in Barcelona one that we will never forget. We hope to return in the very near future!!", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful little boutique hotel with an amazing restaurant\u201d", "Author": "Leapingferret", "ReviewID": "UR113048539", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for one night in May.

So few architects are able to apply Le Corbusier design while creating an exquisite space for people to enjoy; whoever designed this hotel was an able individual! The staff were simply excellent and so professional (especially Pilar) while at the same time friendly and engaging; If possible i would contact Marien Inigo-Schneider the Hotel Manager directly especially if you are going to stay for 5 to 7 days. Get a Chauffeur to and from the Airport arranged by the hotel; some Spanish taxi drivers think they are Alonso... The Room: Sound proofed... Aircon that works effortlessly... Huge comfortable bed... Electric remote control curtains... B&O integrated TV, DVD et al; take some DVD's & CD's to make the most of this when you are chilling out... Wifi in the rooms as well as throughout the hotel take your iPad... A bathroom / shower room that is just fantastic... Lots of storage / hanging space... Sensible amounts of bottled water in the rooms (still and sparkling); no hotels seem to do this i am still mystified why they don't; how can 5* be 5* if you are thirsty? Breakfast: So often i miss breakfast because it finishes \"too early\" at ABaC you only had to make it down before 11am i made it once and then never missed it. Everyday we finished off our breakfast / brunch having coffee & water on the terrace / garden outside enjoying the sun. Lunch / Room Service Menu: Even the room service food was fantastic but i suppose when you think it though the kitchen is run by a 2* chef. Dinner 2*: Make sure you book in for two evenings during your stay the first night you arrive (if you are not too tired) & the second last night of your stay. It is a fabulous dinning experience. I recommend Cava - Torre De L'Homenatge 1999 from the wine list. You now you are dinning somewhere special when you can walk thru the centre of the kitchen during service and it is spotless! Spa: A lovely space but Marien was saying she was not happy with it and further work was being planned. Barcelona: What a great city lots to do, for me though the Sagrada Familia stole the show. I actually went to see it twice; you can feel the genius. I also tried to get up the huge telecommunication tower designed by Sir Norman Foster overlooking the city but sadly it is restricted access.

Definitely deserving of the star rating, and very classy. Very small and personal feeling. Modern designs and layout. I was traveling solo, and found the bar, restaurant, and general activity level to be low in the hotel, so it was hard to meet others. I went to the spa four times and was the only person each time. I never saw others in the bar. So, unlike the other hotel I stayed in during my visit (Villa Emilia), this was better for a private, quiet, romantic visit. Villa Emilia had more action in its restaurant, bar, and rooftop area.

After the checkin Marien gave us a very detailed synopsis of Barcelona which included sights, transportation,museums, shopping and restaurants (earlier she had e-mailed us a list of top restaurants that SHE recommended and then had made reservations for us). All I can say is that Marien is a highly knowledgeable and sophisticated person with impeccable taste. We quickly learned to seek out her advice for anything. The hotel was modern and beautifully appointed. The rooms were large with abundant drawer and closet space, a large and Extremely Comfortable bed and a huge bathroom. The rooms were cleaned at least twice a day and the chocolate bar on our pillow was a huge plus (excellent), The hotel restaurant (2 star Michelen) was an excellent choice. The tasting menu was not only delicious but also entertaining (restrained molecular with a leaning towards local foods and respect with Catalan cuisine). The wine list and sommelier were both excellent and the overall service matched he two star rating. However the highlight and most enjoyable moments at Hotel Abac was the breakfast. Abundant (too much actually) and beautifully prepared and served by the delightful Pilar (who I wanted to kidnap and bring back home with us). Our only concern was that the hotel was 3 Km. from the center. This turned out to be and advantage as the subway entrance, taxi stand and bus stop were all at the hotel entrance and the center of town less than ten minutes away....even late at night. I, for one, cannot wait to come back to Barcelona and the Hotel Abac. P.S. If you have the opportunity take the train and go to Sant Pol de Mar for lunch at Restaurant Sant Pau.
