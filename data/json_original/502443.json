The bed linens were always clean, the towels were taken daily, the pool (and area) were extra clean. I was so impressed. A shout-out to the hostess for help in our emergency. My dm woke up on the 2nd morning with a case of gout and was in terrific pain. I called the front desk for information on a pharmacy that delivered. (Note to Branson and other places of interest: if you have lots of elderly and children visiting your city, encourage a pharmacy in your city to DELIVER MEDS) She gave me the name of a pharmacy that she believed would deliver meds. I called dm's primary health provider's emergency number and was able to give him the phone number of Family Pharmacy in Branson, which was willing to deliver on a Saturday when it normally only delivered on Monday through Friday. By 1:30 p.m., Family Pharmacy had delivered the meds, and my dm was on the way to recovery.

If you book a room on the bottom floor, you WILL hear occasional footsteps as people pass over-head on the upper walkway. I did not hear the people in the room above us. I am a light sleeper and had no trouble getting a decent night's shut-eye. The noisiest part of the morning was all the local bird-song.

Nothing fancy, 19\" TV with Cable, Alarm Clock, and Hair Dryer, but what do you expect for the price, and did I mention how clean it was. They do serve coffee, juice and cake doughnuts in the morning that you can take back to your room; they don't have a sit down breakfast area. The pool was nice sized and clean as well.
