We were there for 3 nights on a Groupon break and found that yes it was a way out of Rome itself, but it wasn't that bad around 20 minutes to get in by minibus. Most places in Rome are a nightmare to get to, it's the nature of the beast. The hotel was clean and tidy and everything worked which is important to most of us. The staff at first seemed frosty but I again think that generally Italians are, so I wasn't put off by this. The food was more than acceptable, we had breakfast every day and although the scrambled eggs and bacon were not what we would get in England, we weren't in England and there was plenty of other things that more than made up for it and at 4.5 Euros very reasonable. We also has a 3 course dinner in the evening and this was excellent and very generous portions. The only down side, if there has to be one is that you could not control the room temperature and the weather was not great and on one night we would have welcomed a little heat in the room. If you go this time of year I would suggest warmer clothing until the temperature rises a bit. We had a great time in Rome and look forward to returning one day, but probably in the city centre, as , for \u00a385.00 on a Groupon was fantastic value, if I were going again i would want to be closer to the centre because the shuttle bus has restricted time and once you were back at the hotel that was pretty much you for the night unless you pay 18 euros each way for a taxi.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cToo far from the centre\u201d", "Author": "Treuiller", "ReviewID": "UR127689311", "Content": "The staff cannot be any nicer and friendlier, but the hotel is too far from the most relevant places at the Citt\u00e0 eterna: one needs to take their shuttle (6\u20ac return, with three set times during the day to go and get back), hire a taxi, use the public transport or just take a very long walk.

One man on reception was particularly rude and unhelpful with little English. The rooms - there is nothing 4star about them!! Shabby, dirty, no plug sockets, air con doesn't work (we were moved three times into different rooms and the air con didn't work in any of these rooms) extra bed sheets haven't been washed in years. The food - don't even bother . . . worst pizza I have ever eaten! After moving rooms twice due to unsuitable facilities i.e. twin room when requested a double we found on our third night that we were surrounded in all directions by a very large NOISY group of students. Needing to be up early for our flight we rang reception at 11 to complain about the noise to be told there was teachers with the group and they would quiten down soon. At half 12 we requested to move rooms, this didn not go down well however reluctantly reception moved us to yet another twin room. Considering the hotel is so big I didn't understand why they thought putting a large group of students amongst holidaying couples was a good idea.

The hotel has an official 4 start rating (and so attracts the 4&5 star rate of local tourist tax at EUR3 per person per night) and it is possible to see that it probably did once deserve such a rating. The only problem is that the hotel has seen it's best days some years ago. The rooms do look a bit worn now with some scuffs to the walls and other general cosmetic maintainence not being attended to as you would expect a 4 star hotel to do so. We did however have a comfortable bed, working air conditioning and a fridge in our room. The room was cleaned daily and adequately with fresh towels and bed linen. Interestingly we did not have a bin in the room and the only electric plug socket was behind the TV unit and so we had to pull out the furniture and unplug the TV to use it. We did not have breakfast included in the package we booked and so had to pay EUR6 per person per day that we wanted to have breakfast at the hotel. On the first day we skipped breakfast at the hotel because the restaurant was swarming with a number of large Italian coach parties and we could not get a table and the noise level was dreadful. On the other 4 days this was not a problem and the food (both in terms of quality and variety) was very good. One slip up was that on our last day the restaurant opened at 7am but they didn't start to bring out food for anyone except a coach party staying there until 7.15 and we had to leave by 7.30 to make our flight, which made it even more rushed. We did try the hotel A la carte restaurant for an evening meal. It was very expensive for what you get. The portions are tiny and leave you very hungry and it is not great quality (but perfectly edible). The prices of wine in the restaurant can be alarming but the local red wine (or Rosso Lazio) is perfectly good and drinkable and a lot cheaper than any of the other choices. Don't order the \"fresh fruit\" from the dessert menu as you will be disappointed! This is not a fruit salad or similiar. You actually just get a bowel containing 1 apple, 1 orange and 1 peach - nothing done to them at all. Nice enough if that's what you want but not for such a price! The Hotel does provide a shuttle bus service to the city centre (near Termini metro station) which we used a couple of times but as it only runs in each direction 5 times daily it just never suited when we wanted to go back. We instead used the local metro and buses which are quick (sometimes there is a bit of a wait at Pietralata for bus 211) but if you are tired it might seem like a bit of a trek. The hotel says get off at the 7th stop from Pietralata but we found that it was better to get off at the 8th stop as there is a pavement all the way to the start of the hotel driveway (very steep) from this stop. From the 7th stop you have to walk at the edge of the road for part of the way which we did not like. The area is a bit run down and certainly not the best of areas but also it's not that bad. It's better than many areas of London and we didn't feel in any way threatened or intimidated - it's just not a rich area and has some rather sorry looking ex industrial sites nearby. The staff in the Hotel had very variable standards of English but the reception staff had a good knowledge of a number of languages and everyone did seem to want to help as much as they could even if there was sometimes a bit of a communication barrier.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evansville, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Daolinite", "ReviewID": "UR118447703", "Content": "My husband and I just spent five nights at the Rouge Et Noir.

We wanted somewhere with a pool so I could go shopping and my fiance could stay behind at the hotel and relax (we have already done the touristy thing in Rome). At face value the hotel seemed fine and for 50 euro it was a steal. But it came at a price! 1. The hotel was quite out of the way from the city centre and all cabs either charged a flat rate, or if calling one from the hotel they start their meter from the moment you call - so you can potentially have a 12 euro fare before you even get into the car! 2. Getting to the metro required a decent walk and a bus, taking a considerable amount of time. 3. It is implied that the pool is part of the hotel - it is not. It is a separate business close by that costs 3 euros to use and is a miserable excuse for a pool area with lots of noisy teenagers. 4. Now the shower. Oh boy. Firstly it wasn't cleaned properly with the previous guests 'hair' remaining on the soap dish. The shower head was broken. We went down to reception (as they weren't answering the phone) and finally someone came up to take a look at it but were unable to fix it and couldn't offer us another room. So we had to shower while holding the shower head ourselves - not impressed. 5. The breakfast was nothing to write home about. In actual fact I'd suggest choosing to sleep in than to bother waking up for it. Overall, I think the money you'll be spending on cabs etc you're better off looking for something closer to the city centre.

Plus every summer we take groups of soccer players and their families to Italy. All I can say is... thank god we didn't take one of our groups to this hotel - or we might be out of business! Luckily, we were only there one night with our 3 children before our return flight to the US after a 5-week stay in Italy. Though the rates were low, I would have been willing to pay double the price somewhere else just to have a clean room! It is NOT worthy of any 4- star rating \u2013 more like 2 stars. This was the first time in my many years of travel that I have ever taken photos of a hotel to post online and the only reason we did was to show we weren't kidding. We just couldn't believe how our stay deteriorated at every turn - even our kids felt the same. The only positive thing was the hotel restaurant - the food we had at dinner was surprisingly good. I am very familiar with the lovely city of Rome (all my grandparents were from there) but this area is really ugly. The hotel is in a very unpleasant area with graffiti on every building. You can see samples of that in the photos posted by others here. There are no nice places to walk to - and you wouldn't want to venture out in this neighborhood at any time. The hotel does have a shuttle bus to Rome - that's about the only convenience. The photos on the hotel website are very misleading as is the description of the \u201crelaxing\u201d Olympic size pool. First - the pool isn't Olympic sized and it isn't managed by the hotel, nor is the environment clean or relaxing, rather it's a community pool PACKED with people from the neighborhood - for which you pay 5.50 euro per person per day (with mandatory swim cap). The pool was dirty, not a lounge chair in sight, and the small deck areas were crammed with people - loud music blaring and people shouting, lots of cigarette smoking. The \"bar\" area of the pool was run by some rude kid who despite my speaking fluent Italian acted as though he didn't know what I meant when I asked to purchase the mandatory swim cap. He also refused to make change for a 10 euro note when my daughter wanted to buy 2 ice creams.. Absolutely ridiculous. You definitely would not want to bring any business group to this pool. Also, the hotel doesn\u2019t let you pay at the front desk for pool usage. You have to deal with people at the pool \u2013 who don\u2019t let you charge anything to your room \u2013 there is no true linkage between the pool and the hotel/ However, our greatest concern was inside of the hotel. We had 2 rooms for our family so it wasn't just a case of a one room problem. The first room my husband and I were given reeked of vomit the minute we opened the door and the carpet was filthy as were the walls. When the porter arrived to check the room, he had to step back into the hallway when he opened the door because the stench was so bad. He immediately ripped off the bed covers and threw them in the hallway. I was shocked that any cleaning staff would have even made up a room with such odor and NOT reported it to the management. Then again looking at the filth in halls and balconies \u2013 clearly the cleaning staff could care less. Speaking of management - no apologies from them about the vomit stench! When they gave us another room, we soon noticed the bedroom carpet was filthy with stains, the lamp shade had stains, and the walls had peeling wallpaper, and holes. The bathroom had mold, the base of the sink faucets leaked when turned on, the shower head kept falling down. Same scene in our children's room only they had the added pleasure of a balcony filled with cigarette butts. The hallway on our floor had dirty carpet and walls badly marked up. It looked like the halls hadn't been vacuumed in ages. I checked other floors thinking the halls might be dirty just on our floor but saw the same situation elsewhere. Also, no minibar in rooms \u2013 just vending machine in hallways (that ate our euro without dispensing the snacks \u2013 why was I not surprised? LOL) The bedroom doors are very thin and the windows not soundproofed so you'll also have the pleasure of being awakened by the student groups that I have learned, too late, frequent the place and party at all hours. Our youngest child woke up the next morning with large bug bites on her arms \u2013 which didn\u2019t surprise anyone. Our kids are hardly picky about hotel conditions but they didn\u2019t even want to get in those beds! See the photos to believe the facts. Stay away from this place.

If you want to save some cash, get the Blue Metro line to Pietralata, when you come out of the station, cross the road to the bus stop over to the left. Get the 211 bus (you can use your Metro Ticket). The bus trip should take about 5mins, keep an eye out for the hotel on your left, it's quite hard to spot. If you go past a restaurant called BiSteak...you've gone to far, get off and walk back to the hotel, just about 10mins from BiSteak or just go straight into BiSteak food there is fabulous if you like your beef! We used the shuttle bus to get in and out of town, it's 3euro single/return. Ask for a room on a floor high up, sometimes youngsters on a group trip stay up late....enjoying their freedom and can be quite noisy. We were on floor 5 so weren't affected but met a couple that had to be moved. Nice hotel, would book again. Oh, they ask to keep your passport for the duration of your stay, just make sure they give it back when you check out!! We discovered they'd forgotten to give our passports back on our way back to the airport!!", "Date": "March 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Staples Center", "Title": "\u201cGreat Price for Great Trip\u201d", "Author": "clippersrule", "ReviewID": "UR12846259", "Content": "Interior of hotel nice, but outside is industrial/urban.

(I thought the hotel shuttle was too time restrictive)Continental breakfast was good (redundant after 3 days) We had a nice room. Get a room with a city facing view. FCO to Hotel on the cheap (about 15 euros per person vs. 75 euros by cab) Take TrenItalia from FCO to Roma Tiburtina. At Roma Tiburtina, take subway to station Pietralata. (There is a grocery store next to subway station for snacks if you want.) Take bus 211 toward Cimone (across from subway station). Get off at (Itor) stop. (See bus stop pic).

In a nutshell, it's clean, the staff are helpful and the bedroom was more than comfortable. The hotel is on the outskirts of the city. However, it turned out to be a fantastic base to visit Rome from, especially with the coach service the hotel provides - 3 Euro's return per person, dropping off near the main bus and train station. It turned out to be a definite benefit as anything beats driving through those crazy streets in a hire car! On asking the hotel receptionist, we were directed to a Pizzeria about 400 metres away from the hotel. The food there was absolutely fantastic, typically Italian and reasonably priced (and so was the wine). Our deal through lastminute.com also included breakfast which consisted of bread, ham, cheese, coffee and juice. Nothing too elaborate, but substantial.

Nice terrace bar with views Access to City: They run a coach service to the city & back (about 6 out & 6 times back per day) that costs 3 euros return & takes about 30 minutes.

The look of the hotel was not very nice, although inside was light and airy. Rooms were OK, but no more than that. They were lovely and clean and towels were changed every day.

The hotel staff were freindly although English was very vague. When we arrived we were given a key to a room pointed the direction of the lift and nothing else. We were not advies about breakfast times or any other services available to us. It does have a pool but they let the locals use it for about 9 euros a day so was always full even thought the hotel was not. We didnt eat at the hotels so cannot advise on food but while we stayed the we did not see a resterant. The interior was done to a very high standard and was always very clean. The rooms was nice a had a bathroom with shower. We stayed on the 8th floor and had a great view out into the centre of Rome. Travel by car around rome is not reccomended unless you have satnav as it is poorly signed. We travel by car to the Train terminal then used the metro to get to the sights of Rome.
