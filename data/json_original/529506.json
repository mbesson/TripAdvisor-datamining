It's been my home in Berlin now for several years. I stay there 3 weeks at Christmas,and three in the summer, generally at asparagus time, and before the theatres go on holiday. My regular room was the original LARDER of the old flat, in this lovely Jugendstil house, with its ornamental courtyard and architectural details wherever you look. Breakfast is at a huge table and a smaller one, so conversation usually flourishes, though privacy is respected. I am completely at home there with Vitali and his family, have everything I need. Rely on my own mobile for messaging. Loads of my friends have stayed there on my recommendation. Savignyplatz station is up the road, and the Kurfuerstendamm round the corner, ideal position.", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh (Scotland)", "Title": "\u201cValue for money Hotel-Pension\u201d", "Author": "Gogs63", "ReviewID": "UR54027301", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Hotel-Pension Waizenegger with my wife during a visit to Berlin. Its in a fantastic location closed to public transport links and good shops and restuarants. We were met by the very friendly owner who asked us if we wished to speak in German or English and then he gave us a quick tour. Our room was small but comfortable and it has a great shower with loads of hot water. Breakfast was good you could eat as much or as little as you liked and there was also lots of strong coffee. The hotel is definately value for money, but the one disappointing point was that people were allowed to smoke in the hallway, which left a lingering smell of smoke all around the hotel.", "Date": "January 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat little guest house in a great location\u201d", "Author": "KevC", "ReviewID": "UR22350923", "Content": "Stayed here for four nights in late November 2008, and was very happy with it. The en-suite room we had (number 5) was at the front of the building, but the road was quiet on a night and we never heard any noise from the other guests. The room itself was quite big, but the bathroom was tiny - the only disappointing thing about the place really - although the shower had plenty of piping hot water, which is all that counts! The towels were changed daily, and the sheets changed every 2 days I think. The room was centrally heated, and had secondary double glazing (two sets of wooden windows) so the room was always nice and warm after a chilly day out! The continental buffet breakfast was good, with plenty of choice and unlimited tea/coffee etc. The hotel itself is more like a guest house, in converted flats, and although the decor is a bit dated the place had a certain charm and character that other hotels would not have. It was also in a fantastic location, 2 mins walk from Kurfurstendamm, and 5 mins walk from Savingyplatz S-line station giving access to the whole city within a short train ride. Overall I'd recommend this hotel as a great budget base for exploring Berlin.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNot happy with room\u201d", "Author": "sagittarianrealm", "ReviewID": "UR20727958", "Content": "Complete front of building had large scaffolding and green mesh. Windows were covered with plastic. First night we stayed in a room called Hackesche 2. A narrow room with 2 single beds (one which creaked and creaked). Of more concern was the lack of movement space between the beds. We requested another room the following morning. Called Hofe 1, this room had a more modern feel to it, but here again we had to walk sideways to move past either bed. Walls between both rooms were paper thin and the drawing of curtains, hairdryer in use and alarm clocks could be clearly heard. Our booking was for a double room, but in reality each of these rooms was more like a single. We value safety above everything else and the size and layout of these rooms jeopardized this. We were perfectly pleased with the buffet breakfast, but would not stay at Pension Waizenegger again.", "Date": "October 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sk\u00e5ne", "Title": "\u201cGood situated\u201d", "Author": "kittycj", "ReviewID": "UR17106555", "Content": "This small pension/hotel was very good located on a charming, calm street next to the Kurf\u00fcrsten damm, very convenient to the local train that took you all the way to Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport (station Savignyplatz).

There is no reception as such, but you are given the keys, so you can come + go as you please. Our late night arrival wasn't a problem (it was midnight), the owners son was there to meet us. This is a good hotel for anyone who likes to mix with the locals,and have all facilities on the doorstep.

The building is wonderful, the Mommsenschl\u00f6schen, a classical Mitteleuropa building with a great staircase and beautiful courtyard. The Waizenegger has only 8 rooms so it is very cozy. Breakfast is served around a large table, so you can get to know your fellow travelers. Most were German while I was there and I speak German, so we got along fine. The room was adequate, and fine for the price. The only problem I had was that the street outside is so peaceful and quiet that when the supermarket delivery started across the street at 6:30 AM it felt very noise. The location is first class. Mommsenstrasse is a beautiful tree-shaded Charlottenburg street with classical buildings, small shops and restaurants, and is right around the corner from the Ku-Damm. The S-Bahn is two blocks away and the U-Bahn 3, with all the buses on the Ku-Damm right there.
