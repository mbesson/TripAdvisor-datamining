Breakfast is included but standard at best (ham, bread, coffee, the etc. e.g. no warm stuff bacon, eggs etc. when I was there). They have two room types comfort room has WiFi and costs a bit more. As far as I could find the rooms have no AC. There is a minibar in the room, the hotel bar is normally closed. No safety deposit box in the room. There is not much to do in the area. At 15 .. 20 minutes walking you will find in the Blankenburger Str. Restaurant/ beergarten Hofstall on about the same distance in Pasewalker Str (opposite direction from the crossing with the Blankenburger Str.) there is an Azian restaurant. That\u2019s about all the action you will find in the area. For more action, you take the tram followed by the metro to the town center.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tilburg, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cQuiet hotel with easy access\u201d", "Author": "andrelot", "ReviewID": "UR120976704", "Content": "The hotel is on a remarkably quiet spot of a residential area in the northern outskirts of Berlin. Found it easily with my car in the middle of the night when I arrived. Staff was very helpful, even managed to assist me getting the uwmeltplakketen (environmental sticker) so that I could drive my car into downtown Berlin! The room is quiet and clean. Negative remarks go to the jurassic TV set that evokes former East Germany - small, worn-out, a let down. The entrance to the parking garage is narrow, curvy and requires a bit of attention. An extra large car such as a SUV might have some difficulties. Other than that, the room is quiet, well insulated from the street that passes in front (I stayed at the lowest flower, semi-entrenched, and still didn't hear a car accelerating while in the room). Breakfast is impressive for the price range, worth the extra cost, with a wide selection of bread, cheese and appetizers.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel at very affordable prices\u201d", "Author": "rogerinbcn", "ReviewID": "UR120221578", "Content": "This hotel is a great hotel at very affordable prices. It is next to the tram station and night bus stops a few steps away from the doorway. Very convenient although it is not centrally located. The rooms are very basic, but practical and the breakfast is super for a very affordable price, really good.

The rooms are similar to any of the big chain hotel, clean and comfortable. It is the quietist hotel I have ever stayed in. So quiet you can hear the birds singing during the day. The train station is 15 minutes walk and it is 20 minutes to the centre of Berlin. Or 3 minutes drive to a dual carriageway connecting to the city centre or the autobahn. The downside is, the hotel is situated in an area with few shops and even fewer restaurants. If you don't mind pizza or kebabs its great.
