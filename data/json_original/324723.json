Thirdly, the staff are NOT rude and scary, in fact they are very friendly and helpful, but the language barrier can make them appear surly or just plain \"baffled\", you need to persist... I had a room that was more box like than room, and the small window looked out into a void that contained all of the hotels air conditioning units. Unpleasant. I have read about this room in other reviews, so maybe there are a few like it. That said the room was comfortable and clean. The bed was comfortable, and the en-suite all worked as it should. A free to use valuables safe was contained in the wardrobe. The hotel provided a very good breakfast, but the same restaurant in the evening was not so good, it seemed no-one was using it much, so most of the menu was not available. The hotel is located a few yards from Taksuray tram station, which is four stops from the Blue Mosque, Tokapi Palace and Hagia Sofia complex, and only 2TL for a ticket, so very well located for touring. Its also only a short walk to Grand Bazaar. However being in the shopping area, its not the best place for external restaurants, you need to travel back to the tourist areas, or to the bazaar areas for the best meals. A metro (also 2TL) will get you to Taksuray (Metro) station in 30 minutes from the airport, it is then a short walk to the tram station and then to the hotel., so very cheap to travel in and easy to locate.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin, Germany", "Title": "\u201cDirty, noisy, unfriendly service\u201d", "Author": "L W", "ReviewID": "UR124799257", "Content": "The hotel location is ok.

The breakfast is amazing. I think it is aimed for the Russian travellers as you would not believe what is served. Chips and hot dogs, beetroot etc?/ and the toaster is hopeless.

This does not matter that much though, there are many good ones in Sulthanamet, where the Blue Mosque & Hagia Sofia are located. Hotel restaurant is on the top floor overlooking the Bosphorous. Hotel is cramed in between other very tall buildings (common in Istanbul), so dont expect a good view unless maybe you stay at the top..

One thing which did seem strange was that they served chips & hotdog style sausages for breakfast everyday. The hotel was advertised as only being a 10 minute walk away from the old city & tourist area, however it took us nearly 30 mins walk to get to the Blue mosque area. We spent most of our time in Taskim in the New City & this hotel was just too far away from there. The hotel is just around the corner from the main bus route & Metro stop, the public transport is very cheap. There were several hotels. bars & restaurants around the hotel, some were reasonably priced others not. Laleli appears to have a large Russian tourist base, so much so large number of the shop signs were in Russian. The Hotel seemed to cater more towards a Russian client, and we were the only Turkish/English guests. Apart from the food, we had no problem with this hotel itself, probably one of the better hotels we have stayed at in Turkey.

The positive things: The hotel provides good and clean accomodation in (at least in my room and those I could take a look in) renovated rooms in a rather quit neighbourhood. For the price I paid (35\u00e2\u201a\u00ac/night), you get good value for your money and a reasonably good standard. The breakfast buffet is a mixture of some hot and cold food, with among other things plenty of coffee and tea, fresh salad, cheese and goat cheese, boiled and scrumbled eggs, meat spread, various types of bread and roles, yoghurt, various types of jam, musli, chips/french fries, and apples. The breakfast room is situated on the top of the building and provides a picturesque view over the Bosporus. Rooms are equipped with hair-dryer and air-conditioning. There are some delilcious, inexpensive turkish fast-food restaurants in the surroundings. The (rather) negative things: The staff (except for those serving the breakfast!) was neither too attentive nor too polite. Everything was done and normally you got the information you asked for - which in my case was virtually everything from breakfast times to how to switch on the lights -, but do not look for the service you may be used to in especially Anglo-saxon countries. There is some variety of rooms; the window of some of them does not face the street or backyard but some pretty dark air shaft. Since I got up early and came back quite late this was no problem for me, in case you intend to work in the hotel ask for a room with a brighter and better view! The pool was out of use and, despite its 25-30\u00c2\u00b0C, only filled with some 1/3 of water. Some of the reviews stated an aweful location. Though it actually is no district with a lot of pubs and night clubs, the next tram stop is about 5 minutes walk away, Aksaray, the last Metro station on the airport line about 10-15 minutes walk (which is pretty good when arriving late at night - reception opened 24h) away and even the old town with some 15-20 minutes in walking distance. So, you can make it anyway in a relatively short amount of time. Thus, in sum, this hotel may be a very good budget accomodation for your stay in Istanbul, which definitively is worth the money, in case you intend to walk the streets of Istanbul or have meetings at daytime. In case you are looking for good service or a location directly situated in the city centre you should opt for another hotel and/or higher category.", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Selsdon surrey", "Title": "\u201cperfect long week-end\u201d", "Author": "flower08", "ReviewID": "UR13486231", "Content": "As I have always wanted to see the blue mosque in Istanbul we seized the opportunity to go mid feb2008 We thought the weather will be better than England.Unfortunately it was worst.
