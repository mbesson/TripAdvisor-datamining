The rooms here are always nice and clean. (I've stayed here 3 times before but I'm just now writing a review). They are all suites with the perfect size living area, kitchen, bedroom and bath. The two flat-screen TVs allowed me to watch my favorite shows while in any place in the suite. I've never had an issue with anything during any of my stays here. No loud heating system, no uncomfortable beds, no clogged up shower drains - all the stuff that really turns me off about some other hotels I've stayed in.

The hotel has the standard Residence Inn amenities; free breakfast, manager's reception Monday-Wednesday and free laundry (a pleasant surprise). I paid $165 per night mid week which was relatively high but I was on company travel so I really didn't care. My biggest gripe is the fact that there is no wireless internet in the rooms. What hotel in this day and age has no wireless internet? As a frequent user of my iPad, I prefer wireless over LAN and this was a big inconvenience.

The front desk was exceptionally friendly. The hotel was spotless -- far better than some of the luxury hotels that I have stayed in. Breakfast was more than adequate. The room was very good, though noise from the frig and HVAC sometimes woke me up. Two flat screens, good amenities, good water pressure and a nice kitchen. One item that could be improved -- there was no luggage rack in the room. Parking is free and plentiful. In contrast, when I stayed at a hotel in Baltimore, they charged $20+ nightly plus a fee every time you entered/exited the parking garage.

I cannot say enough great things about it - in fact, after a while I started accidentally referring to the place as \"home\"! The staff are incredibly friendly and attentive. Marula was a real sweetheart, and all front desk personnel were very helpful in addressing whatever questions I posed. Housekeeping was great - they even loaded/unloaded my dishwasher a few times which was unexpected (but nice!). Initially I booked a 1-Bedroom suite, but having seen the Studio, I decided to switch because the Studio had a much more open feel and the 1-Bedroom actually felt smaller since the only real difference between the two rooms, in my opinion, was the addition of a wall to separate the sleeping area from the living room. The Studio also had a breakfast bar area whereas the 1-Bedroom setup had a small dining table instead. Both rooms included a fold-out couch which could accommodate 2 additional guests. In both rooms the amenities included: a dishwasher, full size fridge, sink with disposal, kitchen stocked with plates, bowls, cups, silverware, cooking utensils, pots, pans, dish detergent, and coffee maker. The bathroom area provided a hair dryer as well as shampoo, conditioner, lotion and soaps. Additional toiletries were availble from the front desk. Some of my favorite perks were: free laundry (your room comes with a laundry basket and there were 4 washers and 8 dryers available down by the gym; detergent and fabric softener sheets were free at the front desk); free breakfast (fruits, cereals, eggs, bacon, sausage, yogurts, coffee, tea, juices, etc.); complimentary grocery shopping (you give them a list of what you need and they'll buy it for you - you pay for the groceries but the service is free); happy hour on Mondays - Thursdays (free beer and wine, and usually some sort of food such as hot wings, pasta dishes, or burgers); and a trolley service on demand that will bring you to local places such as the mall, the bus park & ride, and The Avenue (an outdoor mall with several restaurants and bars). Yes, the trolley service was free too but don't forget to tip! The location is also great. You have plenty of dining options within a short walk or drive from the hotel (your typical chain restaurants), plus a grocery store, a regular mall, an outdoor mall, and IKEA (OK most people don't usually buy furniture while they're on vacation but they hey also serve food there!). If you're in town during baseball season, why not check out an Orioles game? You can walk over or take the trolley to the bus park & ride on the other side of Honeygo Blvd. - behind Ikea - and for $20 round trip per adult (children are probably cheaper), you can hop on a bus to Camden Yards. It's about a 30 minute ride and you don't need to deal with the hassle of driving, parking, and paying the tunnel toll. They drop you off right at the gate and pick you up there after the game. Camden Yards is a beautiful, modern park and the games hardly ever sell out so tickets are usually available for as little as $12. My stay at this hotel was an enjoyable one, and the surrounding area provided everything I needed to enjoy my temporary home.

Everything was in great working order and super clean. We also enjoyed their fully equipped gym and yes, they even had towels on hand in there. The full hot breakfast buffet was lacking nothing and everything was delicious.
