A suggestion: if you are driving and want to visit central Rome, use your car to go to the underground parking of \"Via del Muro Torto\" (underneath Villa Borghese, 2\u20ac/hour). From there you can exit in \"Piazza di Spagne\", right in the hart of the big city and, from there, you can reach most of the main attractions through public transport.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cBad Location\u201d", "Author": "LovTravelOz", "ReviewID": "UR120407179", "Content": "The room and service is alright but the location is really bad.

The staff at the reception told us to turn left when we walked out of the hotel and and then turn left again at the next turn and then turn right. We were a bit unsure walking down the slope with all private houses and cars around. But true enough, there is a family restaurant in the middle of nowhere and it is about 10 mins walk from the hotel They were many families there.

The hotel itself is fine - comfy beds, good size rooms, bathroom ok (shower broke on friday night but was fixed on saturday morning), its a nice residential area. To get to the centre of Rome you need to catch a bus, then a tram. It only costs 1 euro and we waited 15 minutes for the bus on a sunday. It took us 30 min to get to Piazza del Popolo. We ended up catching a taxi back at the end of the day and it cost 14 euro. The next day the public transport was on strike so no buses! The real problem is there is no food available at the hotel at night. they offer \"microwave meals\" and the closest restaurant is at least a 20 min walk away (down a BIG hill). We had the bad luck of being there on a Sunday night so had to walk even further and the only option was a steakhouse another 10 min down the road. It is a real pain after a full day of sightseeing in Rome. Needless to say the other nights we stayed in the city centre for our dinner! We would not stay here again as it is just too inconvenient to travel to the city centre each day, better to stay closer and make it easy on yourself.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "North West", "Title": "\u201cBusy Road\u201d", "Author": "Gorgran", "ReviewID": "UR118490897", "Content": "This is a small Hotel on the outskirts of Rome.

Moreover the public transportation in the area is not good: there's only a small bus in front of the hotel entrance, with long delay to be expected. Inside the hotel is instead very clean and quite comfortable, especially if you are lucky and are not assigned the really too small room that happened to me.

Getting to and from the hotel was a bit of a hassle, as it is located in a residential area in Monte Mario; meaning we had to catch 2 buses to get to any of the sites. Again, we got over that problem. My advice is that if you don't want the hassle of waiting for buses, choose a hotel which is close to the underground stations - we found Line A to be particularly good at getting around everywhere. Moving onto the hotel. The food wasn't that great, but the the lady who works in the restaurant was very friendly. The room was comfortable, clean, tidy and spacious. It seemed this hotel would suit business travellers rather than leisure, as there was no atmosphere during the evening, sometimes the bar didn't even open!

The hotel is great, lovely accomodation, clean and modern but the food is extremely poor and really let it down. We were lucky to actually eat breakfast as it was very limited, fruit was mouldy, bread stale what more can I say. Evening food was a no no too, they only served microwave meals and it was a very limited choice!!! The hotel is out of town by quite a few miles, however we didn't find getting about and into the centre of Rome a problem. The hotel staff helped us with directions and details of which buses/trams to take and the transport was cheap and frequent. Food in Rome was good value for money, didn't find it expensive at all. The weather exceeded my expectations - I never knew italy could be so hot so if you are going in August make sure you stock up on suntan lotion and water. As the hotel is a little out of town we either ate whilst in central Rome or had to get a bus back into the local area to eat which sometimes was the last thing you wanted to do but bar facilites were not good so staying at the hotel in the evening wasn't really an option (unless like us you had to get an early night as you were totally knackered from walking around Rome) We did a day trip to naples and pompeii, which is definitely worth doing, the hotel had details of many guided tours which this was one of them. It was well organised through a separate company, Green line tours I think it was called. People say that Rome is romantic, I didn't feel that way. It was hot, tiring but the actual place was amazing. I would def recommend going to Rome but would also recommend that you pay a bit extra to stay somewhere closer to the centre of town.", "Date": "March 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derbyshire", "Title": "\u201cdon't go!\u201d", "Author": "lou&drew", "ReviewID": "UR6573012", "Content": "We are working people and don't get many holidays at all,(one a year if we are lucky as have own business) so when we do, we need everything on tap as such, so we can relax and enjoy a bit of luxury! Got holiday deal at very good price, but looking back, would have definately paid more for a better hotel. This hotel would be okay if you are after a budget hotel at a bargain price, but even saying that, I think that stating 'budget' is being a bit generous. If you are the type of person who would leave a hotel early morning, return late evening, want a clean room, not bothered about extra comforts/decor, then here maybe okay for you, but you would still need earplugs (see below!) We, would not stay here again. Must say hotel and the room was very clean (daily clean) but very, very basic no coffee making facilities in room etc. The room we stayed in had two twin beds (asked for double, arrived early hours exhausted, didn't have energy to ask them to change it! we simply pushed beds together or I did, so I could still sort his snoring out!!!!) a wardrobe, a table, a phone, a television(tv, only English channels were two news stations, but we are in Rome!) and thats it. There is not a bar in the hotel as they state! It is a hole in the wall, with a few bottles on a ledge!! Extremely, very noisy hotel, we bought ear plugs so we could sleep!! Without ear plugs, we wouldn't have had any choice but being able to go to sleep after about 1 am in the morning! Ear plugs are now an essential part of our travel pack, just in case!! You will have to catch a bus and then a tram to get to the city centre, which takes about 15 mins to get there (based upon setting off at about 9.30am - 10am), but coming back (4pm ish plus) it will take up to an hour. Hotel situated in domestic area, so there isn't any evening entertainment places within walking distance from hotel. After a full days walking site seeing, would have been nice to just have a little wander in the evening to restaurants etc but you would have to get a bus to get to any. In our opinion, it would be worth paying more to stay in a better hotel and in one which is nearer to Rome centre, so you have easy access for evening entertainment. Wouldn't stay here again.

You must transfer to a tram, metro or another bus. The website said \"close to the Vatican\". It took nearly 45 minutes and two buses to get there. Breakfast was not impressive compared to the other hotels we stayed at. We learned dinner was only served when a group was staying at the hotel. After being told dinner was being served one night, we found it wasn't when we went to eat. I inquired about delivery from somewhere else, since the hotel is located in a quiet, residential area. Not possible. The staff made no effort to try and help us get dinner. However, the biggest complaint we had was the hot water. Or, should I say lack of in the morning. The room was clean. There's a nice terrace on the upper level. But, unless you're with a tour group, I would stay elsewhere. The staff could also do better.
