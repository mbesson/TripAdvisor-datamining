Overall, this was a good hotel for my purpose (precruise overnight stay in Miami, close to the port). Service Christian was on point! While standing at the front desk waiting to check in, another couple walked right by me and up to the counter. Christian (who'd just brought my bags in) observed this and immediately went around the counter to check me in. Less than 5 minutes later, I was up in my room getting unpacked. That's service! The entire staff seemed really responsive and I never had to wait long for anything. A few times I was greeted with \"Mr. So-and-so\" over the phone but this was rare (I have an ambiguous name!). Food Some of the best room service food I've ever tasted!! I didn't have time to visit the restaurants but other hotel guests were very pleased with their food as well. Noise Level There was a surprising amount of noise from above and beside me but absolutely NO noise from the hallways or the pool - which was right outside my balcony. Also, I had the dreaded room-next-to-the-elevator but didn't hear a peep! Amenities There was a full service spa and the poolside guests had their choice of both restaurant and bar menus. Speaking of the pool, there were plenty of cabanas/lounge chairs and even a separate sitting area in case water isn't your thing. Location Right on the water but slightly dodgy. I would have qualms about walking around there alone at night. Also beware of game night for the Miami Heat - the hotel sits very close to the Arena so the traffic can be a bear once the game is over. Extra notes There were only two negative things about my stay - there's a faint pet smell in the room which didn't bother me a whole lot but might set off someone's allergies and the hotel seems to sit in the flight path for an airport (international?) so planes fly overhead all day and night. Again, this was only a minor nuisance. The EPIC hotel is a splurge. Although children are welcome, it's not what I would label a \"family\" hotel. They seem to be aiming more for the 25-40 yr old set or the \"It's only money\" folks. For $200/night though, it was actually a pretty good room. If given a choice, I would stay here again.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, WI", "Title": "\u201cIf you are 40 and under~ this is your place!!!\u201d", "Author": "DairyDancer", "ReviewID": "UR126240253", "Content": "The thumping rap music accompanies far too many hours to appreciate this property in any way unless you are a fan of such perpetual pounding noise.

Everything about this trip was simply amazing, and we cannot say enough good things about the hotel, from the attentive staff to the wonderful accommodations, to the divine food at the upscale, Area 31 restaurant. Upon check-in, we were greeted by the lovely Stephanie, who made sure everything was in order before explaining the hotel lay-out, and area attractions. During our stay, we dined at the Area 31 restaurant where we experienced the most incredible food, and were served by the ever-attentive staff, including Ryan, our wonderful server (his wine suggestion was delicious!!). The next day we were lucky to be able to lounge by the pool, and we were served by several incredible people, including Phillip, who was fabulous! and Christian, who was so accommodating! The next day we had lunch again at Area 31, and while it was very different from our dinner experience, it was delicious, and the service that John, our server, provided was exceptional.

We were also able to see the pool from our room, which was nice. Pros: The service was excellent, though sometimes you would be transferred 3 or 4 times before getting to the right department. The wine hour was a nice touch, and is worth checking out for the free mini-appetizer if nothing else (get there early there seems to be a limited supply). Within walking distance to Tobacco Road. Cons: My only real complaint is parking, which was a nightmare. During the busiest times it seemed like people were waiting 30 minutes or longer to get their cars, which is completely unacceptable if you're paying almost $40 a night for parking.

He wasn't too formal or deferential, just a nice guy who was enthusiastic and thoroughly pleasant. The other employes were also excellent, but this one employee really stood out. I personally prefer this style of employee to that of the RitzCarlton. There we're no negatives regarding the employees. 2. The rooms. The positives; I stayed in a water view Club level room on the 30th floor (top floor). The view was spectacular and the balcony was huge. Very nice. The room's decor is modern, tan and white, very current in style. Furniture was nice. In particular, the lighting fixtures were exceptional, much more interesting than why you generally find in a hotel. The bathroom is large, with a very deep soaking tub. I think the Epic's rooms are as nice as any I've stayed in. The negatives: When I wanted take a soak in the nice deep tub, the water temperature was simply not hot enough to really enjoy it. This was in the morning and when I checked the water temperature later in the day, it was was plenty hot. Too many people using the hot water at once? Also, the TV is not up to par. The reception is not equal on all the channels. Fox was basically not watchable. I called the maintenance man, who arrived within 2 minutes. He worked on the TV for over an hour but he was unable to fix it. I was offered another room but I declined as it was too much hassle. Later in my stay I mentioned this to an employee who told me that \"It's always like that. We tried to watch the Heat one day and the reception was awful.\" I expect better from a hotel of this caliber. 3. The food: I only ate in the restaurant, Area 31, once for lunch. I had the fish tacos and they were acceptable but not great. The prices were actually less than what I expected. I ordered room service once and the food was very good in general. It could be improved by including a glass of ice water instead of a bottle of room temperature water. The roll included was very average and there was not enough butter for the roll. The steak was very good, cooked exactly as ordered. 4. The Club lounge. The positives: The employees were great, very accommodating, offering to refill my drinks. Breakfast was very good; Salmon, bagels/toast, fresh fruit and whole fruit, granola and other cereal, a few pastries, juice, coffee/tea. Lunch offerings were also tasty: two kinds of sandwiches and two cold salads. Evening snacks: little crab cakes, egg rolls, cheeses. The negatives: The lunch offerings were exactly the same both days I was there. They were good, but some variety would help. The evening snacks were not as good: hot foods were not hot and the quiches were just plain lousy. There were no crackers for the cheese, only pita bread that came with some humus. Overall, would I stay at the Epic again? Absolutely! The ambiance is friendly, classy and cool. The rooms are very nice and the water view is great.

There is an opening with a movable shade between bedroom and bathroom, arranged perfectly for watching television while soaking. The toiletries are even especially nice! A very good hairdryer is also available. Hotel amenities are nice too. Try the strawberry mojito at the bar and don't forget the wine hour from 5-6pm in the lobby!

We always check with tripadvisor before we book anywhere and this property was rated #1. It did not disappoint! the front desk was very accommodating and the bell hop was energetic and friendly. We got up to our room on the 28th floor (the only floor that does not allow pets) and when we opened the door we saw a spotless, fresh room. As we opened the drapes and went on the balcony we had an incredible view of the Miami waterways. We had asked for a mini fridge and microwave (we were on weight watchers and didnt want to be tempted with the minibar) but they were not there. No worries, our bellperson contacted the front desk and within minutes both items were set up. The room had it all including an in room pc, flatscreen, huge rain shower, safe, nice bedding, etc. Our first room was part of two rooms that adjoined. In the next room were kids just being kids but the the front desk person could hear them through the phone when I called in. There were staying there a few days. One night I could have dealt with it, but not all week. They moved us down the hall to a room that did not adjoin right away. It was peaceful and very quiet!! We slept like rocks. There were many families there as it was Christmas break week. We upgraded to their concierge level that included access to a separate club room and 5 food and beverage servings a day. You couldn't get a steak to order but all the offerings had amazing fruit, cheese, cold cuts, breads, salads, and wine. Even with our diets we were able to get plenty of yummy things to eat. It was so convenient to not have to decide where to eat and how to get there three times a day. The staff at this club room was super service oriented. We did have a complaint. On a couple of occasions, there was a family with kids. Obviously different cultures deal with their kids differently but basically the room looked more like preschool- kids climbing on the furniture, yelling, running out, etc. The staff tried to be great babysitters, but there were several other couples and we just looked at each other in total frustration. Action needed to be taken. It was kind of like a hangout place for bored teens as well but we would upgrade again because the food was so convenient and fresh. Our suggestion to Epic is to put an age limit on the room of 16 years old and give the families with young ones a different place. The pools were top notch. They have the coolest furniture and the pools were kept at just the right temperature. Pool service was fantastic. We rarely had to look for anyone to help us. The restaurants were great. Some of the best sushi ever. We did drive to South Beach and got on the beach. Rented chairs. Nice. Hated paying $16 for a mojito that was less than tasty. But things were convenient considering how crowded it was. We had the best lunch at Havanas. Some of the best food ever, not just of the Cuban places we've eaten at, but any kind of food. After checking out the strip and some of the hotels we were thinking about staying at, we were very glad we stayed at Epic. Some of the nicest hotels were located right next to sidewalk bars that were sleezy. I'm so glad we didn't have to walk through that every morning. In the other hand, if you are a spring breaker on a budget, you should go for it. The area around the Epic was nice. Brickell is a few minutes away- shopping and food. Even closer are drug stores, wine stores, clothing shops l like Marshalls if you need an emergency pair of flip flops. It is safe and beautiful. You can walk around the promenade and see some amazing boats. Our only other complaint was that it is very, very pet friendly. Now, we own pets. We rescue cats and dogs. But they only have one floor out of a dozen that don't have pets. Problem is for me that I am allergic. It takes me a couple of days to get used to an animal and even then, I still have to take an allergy tab. So even though we upgraded to concierge level (29th floor), we had to stay on the 28th floor as it was the only hypo-allergenic floor. We didn't see too many pets. Just a few droppings by the sidewalk but those are really the fault of inconsiderate pet owners. There were no dogs at the pool or anything. One place I did run into one was at the spa/message place. As I got out of the massage room nice and relaxed a small dog that was off leash was barking at me. I didn't feel threatened but it was bad timing. I'm writing this more not to discourage anyone from coming but hoping that Kimpton will read this and make some adjustments. The gym was very well equipped and everything was working nicely. The staff is so friendly. We got to know many of them by first name and it was like we got connected with family members. Doesn't happen that way for us most of the time.

Not quite\u201d", "Author": "TheTub", "ReviewID": "UR122617117", "Content": "Stayed at the Epic for a one night lay-over in Miami. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to stay on Miami Beach for one night only and was torn between the Epic and the Mandarin Oriental downtown (prices were about the same). In the end, I chose the Epic because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much newer and has received positive press, not to mention its top ranking on TripAdvisor. A bit underwhelming, I must say. First of all, the very first thing one notices upon entering the hotel is the pungent smell of chlorine coming from the decorative fountains in the lobby. Not helped by the unpleasant smell, the atmosphere in the lobby feels very cold, with nowhere to get a drink sitting down: there is a restaurant at lobby level with a bar, Zuma, but you can only have a drink at the bar as the tables are reserved for diners; there also seems to be a separate lobby-level lounge, which was closed on that night; Area 31, the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seafood restaurant on the 16th floor, also has a small bar area, which was, however, occupied. Seems to me they should serve tea/drinks in the lobby itself (where they have a few armchairs/couches), which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be the case when we were there. The room was fine: obviously new and with the requisite amenities (flat screen TV, fee Wi-Fi if you join Kimpton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loyalty program, which takes 2 minutes, a desktop computer, pleasant enough bathroom with separate bath and shower, Etro toiletries, etc.). Like the rest of the hotel, however, the room did strike me of a kind of cheapish luxury, if you pardon the oxymoron. Also, the towels were quite harsh \u00e2\u20ac\u201c odd considering the fact that they must be relatively new. All of this is perfectly acceptable if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying 200-300 dollars for the room, but decidedly less so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying 500+. The one positive feature of the rooms is the large balcony which, depending on where you are in the building, faces the ocean, other downtown skyscrapers or a mixture of the two. As to service, the bell hop who greeted us upon arrival and showed us to our room was very good. However, the receptionists at both check-in and check-out were very much like automatons, repeating pre-prepared blurbs as if they were robots. Similarly, the hostess at Area 31 had left her charm at home. The only food I tried was at Area 31 for breakfast, which was fine. It did, however, cost $35 for a couple of fried eggs on toast with some bacon on the side, a cup of coffee and a glass of orange juice. The orange juice in particular was $6, which, to me, seems a bit steep considering it came out of a carton. Once again, like the rest of the hotel, the d\u00c3\u00a9cor of Area 31 felt rather anemic and generic to me. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dine at Zuma but it was obviously very popular, drawing in the chi-chi crowd in flashy cars. Instead, we ate at the local outpost of Daniel Boulud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bistro Moderne, at the Marriott Marquis opposite the Epic, which I can strongly recommend. The restaurant also has a fine bar with excellent cocktails and a much more pleasant atmosphere than any of the Epic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offerings. There is a reasonably large pool area on the 16th floor, which we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use given the weather. Had a stroll through it though and it seemed nice enough, with well equipped cabanas on one side (with TVs, etc.). Reminded me of the pool area at the Mandarin Oriental in Las Vegas, though not quite as nice. Also, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but notice that quite a few of the mosaic pieces in the pool have come off; once again, quite odd considering that the hotel is new. As an aside, downtown Miami, at least the bit where the Epic is located, is even more dead than I had imagined. All you have is office blocks, residences and a few hotels (in the immediate vicinity are the Marriot Marquis and Hyatt opposite, and the Viceroy across the bridge; the InterContinental and the Mandarin Oriental are also nearby), with, literally, nothing else. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be there any longer than one night, unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re there for business. All in all, if I had to stay in downtown Miami again (quite a big if) and was willing to spend $400-500, I would certainly stay somewhere else (probably the Mandarin). The Epic is certainly not worth that much. P.S.

The hotel is in a lovely location next to the water, and has a beautiful grand lobby. The check-in was easy and the bellhop helpful with the luggage. The room itself was also very large - much better than I was expecting, and has the feeling of a boutique hotel. My only negative comment on the room itself is a lack of shelf space for clothes. There's plenty of hanging space, but if you are staying for a few days and want to unpack, then there's really nowhere for flat packed clothes. (Which is surprising given the sheer size of the room). What was also good was the terminal in the room with free internet access - though it regularly crashes even browsing CNN. At this point, I was impressed and could understand the superb rating it has on this site. However, now for the not so good. It seems as soon as something isn't quite right, the staff don't seem to know how to respond, and so they let the whole hotel down. Call me old fashioned, but I kind of hope my room is thoroughly clean when I move in, so don't really like seeing another person's nail clipping on the floor next to the bed (which stayed there the full 3 days- so they obviously don't clean very thoroughly at all). As well as this, I also reported two broken lights in the room which weren't fixed during the stay. There were many lights in the room, so it wasn't a huge issue - I would just have hoped, given such stellar reviews that the hotel has, that it might have been fixed at some point during my 3 days there. The worst aspect for me was the valet service, which seemed a bit of a shambles. I only hired a car for part of my stay, but was disappointed with a 15 minute wait in a long line of cars on driving into the hotel for the valet. Also, for collecting the car they suggested calling down 15 minutes before needing the car - which I did, and when I got downstairs the car wasn't there. I had to wait a further 10 minutes for a valet to go and get it as they didn't know I'd called down. I complained to the valet to ask what I needed to do, given that I'd called down, in order to get it quicker next time. He apologised and said it was due to a trainee answering the phones who didn't know what to do. If that's true, then it's appalling they let someone answer the phone with no training. When I commented to front desk at the end of my stay about the poor valet service I'd had, the lady just smiled at me and said \"there are always problems with valet services\". Not quite the service recovery I might have hoped for from such a quality hotel. I'm glad I didn't need to use the valet for my whole stay - it would have driven me insane. Finally the concierge - although very helpful, when I asked a question he answered my question to my friend rather than to me, which I found a little rude. A minor point perhaps, which I wouldn't even have commented on had it not been for all of the other disappointing aspects, but it was another aspect of liaising with staff that I was disappointed by. Good service for me comes from maintaining good eye contact with the person asking the question! So, the hotel is stunning, and if you have no need to interact with the staff, you would be hard pushed to find a better appointed hotel- and it really is very beautiful. But in my case, some of the staff let down what could otherwise have been a 5 out of 5 review.

GREAT!!! I called her months ago. Told her that we were surprising our daughter for her sweet 16 as well as a Christmas present for our children, by bringing them to Miami for the first time and letting them experience the Epic as we have. She said that she thought this was soooo great! Told me what she had available and the cost. She also said that this was a \"special rate\" that she had her general manager approve. I said we'll take it! She never texted me back. I have been calling her cell and texting her over and over. Finally I called the hotel and asked to speak with her. She's ALWAYS on lunch or just not in, so I'm guessing she has told the other staff at the front desk to tell me this. I finally called in and talked to another staff member and told them that I was only trying to book the room and need some assistance. I told her the price that this young lady quoted me(which she said she had approved by her manager) and she said no way and doesn't undersatnd why she would tell me this.

The bathroom was large (double sinks and Large tub, and shower stall), and the bed was comfortable. The balcony was huge, and we had a great view. We changed and headed back downstairs. It was raining so we took a cab to a Mexican place about 5 blocks away. We spent some time checking out that area, after it quit raining and headed back to the hotel. We tried to go into the club in the hotel, and I was told I wasn't dressed for the club. So I went upstairs to change, as my wife and friends waited for me. We decided to check out the Asian restaurant bar, but it was too packed and we head back to the club. We were then told there was a private event and we couldn't get in. Everyone was very upset and annoyed, so my friend and I walked down to the Walgreens, 3 blocks away to get alcohol for the room. My wife and her friend went and said something at the front desk, and the person at the desk (the same person that checked us in) went over and said something to the door man, and when the desk person return, he said there was no private party, and we could go in. We DID NOT return. I would never set foot in the EPIC hotel again because I should never be made to feel like I am beneath the door man. We partied in our room and had a good time. The next day, the black out curtains in the room worked well. The shower drained a bit slow, but overall everything in the room was great. My wife and her friend got a massage together, and they had a great time. Only negative was my wife's friend got her nails done, and the girl gave her a guilt trip about giving her a tip on the credit card, so she called her husband to come down and give her a cash tip. While they were at the spa, my friend and I went to rent a car at Advantage rent a car (dirtiest car I have ever rented) To park the car at the hotel is $32 a day. CRAZY. We ordered room service together, and they brought the champagne but never brought the strawberries. We went out to explore Miami more that evening. When we checked out on Sunday, I told the front desk person that the drain was slow in the room, and that we never got the strawberries, so she ask if it was OK to comp me the room service that we received the first night.

Check in was very quick, very helpful staff. Our room was city view on the 22nd floor. The super fast lifts got us there really speedily!! Room was large, two double beds, big flat screen TV, IPod docking station, computer, big bathroom with two separate sinks and a lovely deep bath!! There was a separate rain shower. The toiletries smelt gorgeous. Air con was good and not noisy. There was also a big balcony with two chairs and a table. Our room overlooked the Hyatt, residential pools and the Wells Fargo building. It was quite noisy out on the balcony with the traffic below, but once you shut the sliding doors it was silent. We had breakfast included, which we had in Area 31 on the 16th floor. This was buffet style, coffee, orange juice, cereals, fruit, yogurts, muffins, oatmeal, bagels, toast etc. If you wanted to pay extra you could have pancakes, eggs benedict etc. You could sit either inside or outside on the terrace with amazing views. Also on the 16th floor was the spa and pool area. The staff at the pool would find you some loungers or a bed!! They would lay your towels out for you and bring over a couple of glasses of ice cold water!! You could order drinks and food around the pool too. The pools were heated, it can get a bit windy up there, so this was a good thing. The views from the pool terrace were great, overlooking the cruise port and surrounding skyscrapers, the parks and the main road leading into downtown. The concierge were very helpful, providing maps of local area, restaurants, things to do etc. There is eating places within walking distance, aswell as a CVS pharmacy, Starbucks a couple of blocks away, but main places to eat are at Bayside Marketplace, which is 10/15 mins walk or 6/7 dollars taxi ride. Just south over the bridge is Mary Brickell village with eateries. Also Little Havana where there are numerous places. We went to Aventura Mall for shopping, if you want to do this, it's a fair distance in a taxi, the concierge and internet said it could be 60-80 dollars each way, therefore if you get the local bus it is 2 dollars each way!!!! Walk up to the junction with the Starbucks and the No 3 or 93 bus goes there. Also the S bus via South Beach. The whole environment of the hotel is relaxing with great service but not pretentious. Nothing is too much trouble, for example ringing guest services from your room. I requested a coffee maker which was then delivered promptly!!! Room service was very nice with big portions. Another feature was coffee in the lobby in the mornings, with take out cups. Also wine hour in the early evening, nice extras!!! I liked to see that this hotel welcomed pets, and they had lots of extras for them too, providing beds, toys, food etc!! Even a little welcome sign for them in the lobby!!! Overall we had a great stay, and would recommend it!!!!

The service seemed great when we first arrived, we were greeted by the staff and had a very helpful bellhop help us with our bags and show us the room and features. I was also told about the complimentary (or so I thought) continental breakfast on the 16th floor. The next morning we attended and asked to be seated even asking if this was were the complimentary breakfast was. My wife proceeded to get some outmeal and a banana and I picked up a croissant. When the waitress asked what room we were staying she had informed us that the breakfast was not included with our stay and proceeded to charge us $30 for the items I listed previously (most expesive croissant, banana and oatmeal ever!), I paid and figured I would straighten everything out with the front desk. When I told the front desk about the mix up they said that my room didn't include the breakfast and they apologize for the mix up in telling me at my arrival that it was complimentary without offering to reimburse me! I thought it was unacceptable and didn't understand why they did not credit me for the breakfast but I did not make a big stink and just walked away and figured I would include it in my review. I am far from cheap and this was a matter of principle but really put a damper on the stay. Another thing to make note of is that there are many corporate events held nightly at the pool so don't expect to be hanging out down there in the evening.

We left early the next morning to catch a flight so perhaps we didn't spend enough time there. But we opted to stay there again the next time we were in Miami because of our wonderful experience, and we were disappointed in getting to know the hotel more. Positives: The room is spacious and well decorated - modern, but still warm and chic. The people at the reception desk are friendly. The bellhop and the servers at breakfast were also very nice. Negatives: We had issue with the valet. I have to spend $20 a day, there's no option for self-park, which is fine if I didn't have to wait close to 30 minutes for my car every time I wanted to leave the hotel. This makes a 5 minute stop to a nearby drug store or grabbing a quick lunch out tedious. I had to make the effort of coming down early enough to make time for valet. However, if you happen to have a luxury, up-scale automobile, no waiting for you! They will happily park your car right at the curb in order to decorate their hotel with rich cars to enhance their image I suppose. So these visitors didn't have to wait, while we had to for a half hour just because of the kind of car we were driving. Of course, this is a trend that some hotels do, but I don't like the elitist attitude that seemed to be more prevelant at Epic. When we first arrived in our car, they were waving for us to pull up, then they spotted a luxury car behind us and held up our hand for us to stop and waved for that car to come ahead of us. So we had to wait while they took care of this visitor. And I'd just like to add, we own a luxury car but opted to drive in a less nice car that week since we were doing a road trip. So I am not talking because I am bitter I don't own such a car. Another thing that got on my nerves were the exorbitant prices of everything over there. We've stayed at plenty of luxury hotels and are acquainted with the expected higher prices, but Epic takes it way too far. Breakfast cost me alone as one person almost $40. Their \"buffet\" consists only of cereal and bread. If you want eggs, you must buy that separately. And if you want toast to go with your eggs, you must buy that separately too. Everything is priced separately on the menu, so that by the time you put a meal together, you're shelling out quite a bit for an average course meal. It's to the point where it's not elegant, it's just plain cheap and stingy. Anyway, the point is, the room itself is lovely and the reception was friendly. But the valet is painstakingly slow and the food costs you an arm and a leg.

Out of 804 reviews, 753 of them are either Very Good or Excellent. We are frequent travelers and stay in a lot of hotels all over the world, and there are a lot of times when the reviews on TripAdvisor, particularly for expensive hotels, are considerably overhyped in our opinion, but we'd stayed in Kimpton hotels before and had very good experiences, so we were cautiously optimistic. As it turned out, the reviews were right on the money. This is a first-class hotel that exudes Miami from every pore - from the constant flows of Porsches, Bentleys, Ferraris and Lambourghinis coming and going from Valet, guests dressed to kill, trendy restaurants, and stylish design to the gorgeous views of the downtown skyline and harbor. The only thing that was atypical for Miami was the service - the typical rude, snooty, indifferent staff we've consistently found in Miami was nowhere to be found. In their place were overtly friendly, polite and professional staff that put a smile on our faces throughout our stay. LOCATION - The Epic is located on Biscane Blvd Way, along the river, downtown. It is about 15 minutes from the beach and airport. Shopping and tourist activities are nearby at Bayside Marketplace. There are not a lot of things within walking distance, but you have everything you need at the hotel, and taxis are readily available. It is not easy to find - you have to drive south on Brickell Ave before you see it on your left. Look for the Area 31 sign in the window. PARKING - Valet parking is a whopping $32.00 per day, so unless you really plan on being out and about during your stay, taking a taxi might be more cost efficient than renting a car. The valet was always packed with people, lined out onto the street, took some time to leave and retrieve the car. AMENITIES - There are all the typical 5-star amenities here. The pool deck is huge, stylish and overlooking the river with skyscrapers all around. There is a fitness room, spa, board rooms, two restaurants and a lounge. The lounge unfortunately is closed on Sundays, the only day we were seeking to go there. Area 31 restaurant is on the 16th floor, and has dramatic skyline views from the balcony. Food was very creative, this chef is not afraid to take chances, service was outstanding, prices are high. Closes at about 10:00 PM. Area 31 is mostly a seafood restaurant, so if you don't like seafood you might head elsewhere. Zuma is on the ground floor and ultra-trendy as well. One of those \"see and be seen\" type of places. Serves outstanding Japanese food at exorbitantly high prices. Make sure to make reservations for both places well in advance. CLUB LOUNGE - The 29th floor is the club floor. The lounge has a private concierge and complimentary snacks and beverages of all kinds. The views from the floor are dramatic and the lounge is comfortable. The staff was extremely friendly and really nice, though they were often nowhere to be found. The continental breakfast here was plenty good enough for us each morning of our 4 night stay. Nothing fancy, but sufficient. If you want the snacks, you have to get there immediately as they serve them because they never freshen them up. Hours later, the same previously hot snacks are still there, ice cold. They serve the same ones every day too, so hopefully you like them. Everything was deep fried, nothing fancy just croquettes and popper-type things, only two deep fried snacks and hummus with veggies. The beers and wines were always hidden, you had to hunt someone down and ask for wine, we found that strange especially when all the other alcohol was readily available. The coffee was rarely refreshed, so if you got it out of the pot it was cold, but after you found a staff member they were happy to get you fresh coffee. The staff was really nice, but the overall lounge experience was pretty lackluster compared to other hotels of this caliber - that's probably why we never saw more than one or two other people there in our 4 days. BUSINESS - Epic is clearly geared toward the leisure traveler, but it works for business too. There is free wi-fi only to Kimpton rewards members, so make sure to sign up, it's free. Otherwise you have to pay for wi-fi. There is a computer in the room, filling the only available workstation, so it was awkward to move the computer out of the way to be able to use our laptop. There is only room for 1 person to sit at the desk, which was also awkward for us as we had two computers. The computer is nice for the leisure traveler without a computer (free internet access, but with an annoying browser), but what business traveler travels without their laptop these days? There are all the usual conference facilities as well. ROOM - We stayed in a Club-Level Water View King Premier room. Dramatic floor-to-ceiling windows gave you a great view particularly in the evening where you were surrounded by the city lights of the neighboring skyscrapers. The bed was cushy and comfortable, the bathroom featured double sinks and a standalone tropical rain shower that was great. Mini-bar, a high-quality iron, big flatscreen tv, computer with free internet access, balcony with a small table, and a spacious 475 square feet. We thoroughly enjoyed the room, and the bed was like heaven after a 6-week stint in Peru and Bolivia. Everything we expected, very nice. STAFF - The most impressive thing about the hotel. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, the entire staff knew our names, and even knew it was our anniversary. Smiling, engaging and friendly, from the bellman, to the valet, to the club room staff, to the front desk staff, to the restaurant staff. Nothing was too much trouble. We had a great 4-night stay at the Epic, further enhancing our already good experience with Kimpton hotels. We've been to Miami many times, but this is by far the best experience we've had with a hotel in the city.

After reading up on it and seeing all of the Eco-friendly principles they adhere to, I decided to book it and give them a try. We were not disappointed, this place is beautiful, with modern contemporary decor, understated but elegant, and, super comfortable. Up front I must say that this was my first time and we chose to stay on the Club Level floor, so my experience only takes into account the rooms on Club level. We stayed in a Sea side facing room, 2905 to be exact, and when we walked in and saw the view of the Miami Harbor and Brickell Park Key, it was amazing. The room was very large, very clean decor and provided a very relaxing place to do nothing. The balcony was very large, with a table and 2 chairs for relaxing. I chose a room with the see-through wall into the bathroom. With the blind pulled up it made the room seem much larger and more open, and the view into or from the bathroom was fantastic. The bathroom was top of the line, with smart, practical placement of everything, yet beautiful and very upscale. The Club Lounge is of the medium size, but very well appointed and setup in a way that accommodates at least 10-15 families, if they all decided to enter at once. While we were there, we did not see more than 2 couples at any given time. The snacks and drink assortments were first class, with top-shelf liquor choices. The Concierge and Host, Christopher, were very professional, friendly and went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. They have this great table with a 36-42 inch plasma/LCD screen laid flat on it, that is a Windows Touch screen computer. It has Chess, Checkers and other games that can be played in life size mode, which was one of the coolest things I have seen in a Lounge. You could also browse, look up directions and a number of other things, that was a really nice touch. This isn't your JW Marriott Singapore lounge, with lots of people, noise and waiters running all over the place. It is comfortable, somewhat like a room in your home where you would go to relax. It was a very pleasant experience, as we spent a lot of our time either in the room, at a restaurant or in the lounge. The hotel has two very distinctive restaurants, Area 31, our favorite (I did a separate review on it last week), and, Zuma, a Japanese Sushi fusion place. Zuma is supposedly the best of its kind in Miami, and was very hard to get reservations (I also did a review on them). The hotel bases its principles on sustainability, but does it with very high-end, upscale designs, materials and decor. The atmosphere is one of calm, instead of the usual din of noise that accompanies most hotels. The colors are very calming and areas throughout are peaceful, it feels like a Feng Shui approach. One interesting thing that we found, is that all of the hotel doors were very solid and took some strength to open and close, especially the room entrance and patio doors. We knew that it was strategically done that way, but didn't know why. I asked and found out that they are designed for hurricanes. That made me feel a lot better, considering the fact that they are directly on the water facing the Atlantic. All in all, this was one of the best hotels I have stayed at, and their principles of helping the environment, using sustainable products, serving sustainable foods, and generally caring about the world in which they do business, was the overwhelming factor for my wife and I.

We went with very high expectations, based on the hotel's website and comments on Trip Advisor, about it being the number one \"luxury boutique hotel\" there. The lobby itself was impressive, sparkling clean, spacious with comfortable seating, orderly and nicely decorated, but our room was a disappointment. It was crowded, with two double beds (albeit very comfortable), and cluttered with all the 'stuff' that most hotels display. There was not nearly enough drawer space for the things we had brought for a six-day stay so it became even more cluttered as the days went along. The bathroom was the room's best feature: double sinks, large walk-in shower, lots of towels and a small separate space for the toilet. We had asked for a king-sized bed and aids to help with accessibility problems - e.g. bars in the shower and around the toilet. When we were offered an upgrade we assumed that these would be in the upgraded room. Unfortunately they weren't. The only reason we could see that the room was an \"upgrade\" was that you could see two small bits of Biscayne Bay in between the abundance of nearby highrises. We had anticipated how much we would enjoy sitting out on our balcony but in fact we could only tolerate the excessive noise for a few minutes at a time: the noise from the traffic and drawbridge below our room (2318) was relentless and deafening; add that to planes taking off overhead and you get the picture. We were happy to see a safe in the closet but unfortunately it was on the floor and impossible for one of us to access. The room also had a desktop computer with internet access which was a bonus even though it operated very slowly. Meals at the hotel were expensive and tended towards Mediterranean so we only ate there a couple of times. Breakfasts were best with granola, topped with yogurt and fresh blueberries. You can ask to have a coffee maker brought up to your room but if you order room service, it will cost a total of $12 for a small pot that held four small cups. The first night we were there we were tired and ate dinner in our room. It arrived within a reasonable time and was hot and delicious. One thing about the Epic particularly impressed us and that was the staff. From the moment we pulled up to the entrance we were always greeted and treated like royalty with wide smiles and offers of help at every turn. While this could be said about most hotels to a degree, the Epic staff was exceptional. They made the disappointments much easier to live with.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent and memorable experience\u201d", "Author": "AngelaL770", "ReviewID": "UR119529190", "Content": "I stayed for 2 nights with my husband at the Epic for a business trip.

The room was very large and the bathroom sumptuous. We had a very pleasant lunch and chat with our Italian waiter. The bar and restaurant in the evening has an energetic vibe. Our conference lunch was also good, though sadly we were not able to enjoy it on the panoramic terrace due to the weather. The breakfast buffet is good and less pricey than other similar hotels. But what really impressed us was the bellboy as we left. Christian Betancourt treated us like VIPs and clearly loves working at this hotel. His attitude is the kind of publicity that money can't buy.

And it really was epic! The hotel is beautiful, from the area outside, to the pool area, the reatuarants and the rooms. Our rooms were great (we had two rooms) and very spacoius. The bathroom was beautiful and with a nice size. The service was amazing, the staff was so friendly and polite. Andrew, the concierge, was very helpful and gave us a lot of great tips on what to go in Miami, and also we got coupons for some of the big attractions. He really was a great help to us! The guys that work by the pool was so friendly and quick to make up sunbeds for us. Every morning there was cofee and tea at the first floor. And in the afternoon there was wine a little snacks. A great extra service that made our stay even better. The breakfast at the restaurant was very good, and with a nice view. The location is good, if you're not planning on staying at the beach. It's great that you can walk to the Bayside Markedplace with a lot of shops, boats and restaurants. So for us, travling as a family, the location was great. I would definitly recommend this to all of my friends and family, and I will definitly try to come back if I'm visiting Miami agian. But there were some small things that could have been avoided, and that's why I'm not giving the stay a full score: we had booked two rooms and asked if we could have them on the same floor. The girl at the desk fixed that, but my boyfriend and I got the a room build for handicapped guests. When I called down to ask if we could get another room, the girl at the frontdesk didn't seem as if she knew that that room was build for handicapped. Not very good if people with special needs would have checked in and we were in that room. We got a new room straight away, so that was not a big problem. But I do feel I need to mention it. We booked rooms with sea view, but you couln't really see that much sea from the room. At least not my parents room. I would therefor recommend that guests that want to have a sea view ask for a room above the 18th floor. My parents also had a room just above the restaurant on the 16th floor. One of the days there was a party there, so there was a lot of noise outside until midnight. So if you want a quit room, ask for it not to be above the restaurant. Also: you all have to check you bill carefully! We got the bill early the morning we were checking out, and that was a good thing. We had two cars on valet parking one night, but had been charged for 4 or 5 nights! And we signed up for the Kimpton membership and could take stuff from the mini-bar for 10 dollars without being charged, but we still got charged. After a lot of time at the frontdesk we worked it out, but it shouldn't be necessary to to all that in such a nice hotel.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cNot Really Impressed...\u201d", "Author": "NY_ShoeGirl", "ReviewID": "UR119461235", "Content": "Don't believe the hype of this hotel.

Comfortable furnishings, beautiful pool and spa - great customer service from EVERYONE! Hard to believe that this is also 1/2 residences! - We stayed in a one bedroom waterview suite. A MAZE ING, totally worth the money! - Beds are very comfortable, soft sheets, fluffy pillows, perfect blanket. Robes and slippers as well. - Sofa in living room is very comfortable - felt like i was home - Wifi - if you are a kimpton intouch member (its free) then the wifi is FREE for your stay, and you can access it everywhere - we had no problems with it at ALL during our stay - Room service is quick and VERY yummy - remember, the service charge and gratuity is ALREADY included in the bill, so dont freak when you see it costs more than the room service menu - Housekeeping - what an amazing troupe! Our place was spotless, they understood we were on an extended stay - even refilled our ice buckets for us in the afternoon and evening since we were both working from home - Concierge, Valet, staff in general - wow, what personal touches - everyone treated us like we were long lost family members - they made us feel like we were the only people in the hotel! - Conveniently located to Brickell area (over the bridge) as well as downtown Miami - few minutes we were at Bayside Marketplace on foot. - It is upscale, and it is NOT cheap, however - it is VERY MUCH worth every single dime. Our stay came to a little over $2500 for 5 nights including everything - and we loved every second of it. When family and friends come to Miami, we will def be suggesting the Epic as their first choice. Area 31 - WOW, just WOW - you MUST dine here at least once during your stay - if you don't, you are totally missing out on one of the most amazing experiences ever!!!! - If you smoke, get a room with a balcony! (I have a review of it posted separately) - We plan to always look for a Kimpton property when we travel in the US - we were THAT impressed - You need to ask for a coffee pot in room. The bring a krueig machine for you (yeah!) and since we were working all day, they threw in more coffee, etc. (I wound up running to Publix to pic up some more, off of 8th in Brickell at the back of Mary Brickell village). Can also take the Metro Mover (free) from a stop a couple blocks away that will leave you off a block from Publix. - We always received a smile, coming or going - that is a HUGE difference to the hotel experiences we have had in Vegas - we felt like a member of an elite group, in on the special secret, access to privilege, you name it - THAT is how awesome the Epic in Miami makes you feel! - They also cater to PETS!!!!!!!!! The Cons (nothing to keep you from staying): - no power outlets next to bed in 1 bedroom suites, very inconvenient for phones, etc. Some outlets throughout room were behind sofas, etc. When you have a lot of electronics (ipads, iphones, itouches, 3 computers, etc.) a few plugs just does not cut it - The safe, at least in our room, was located in the bedroom closet, about 12 inches off the floor, sideways - totally difficult to see and get stuff in and out of - very very awkward. - Noisy hot water pipes and auto lock on door would cycle through itself noisily every 20 minutes or so - $32 per day for parking - would expect less $ if you are a Kimpton member and/or staying in a 1 bedroom suite - we could have parked down the street for about half, but were lazy and did not - Room service menu - seriously, written in like 9 point font - LOL - great for the young ones, but for us \"older folks\" needs to be a wee bit bigger :) - Valet area - the only thing about the whole Epic hotel that I did NOT enjoy - wow, someone was sleeping on the job when they created this - between the guests arriving and departing, the residents coming and going, no sidewalks for people heading out to the street - a nightmare is putting it mildly. We were almost hit a few times walking out to Biscayne Blvd Way to head out for the day/night. This problem is exacerbated on Fridays and Saturdays as the restaurants and lounge attract everyone. The area is about big enough for 2-3 cars, one way in and out - just a mess. - Mini bar never got cold (2019) even when they replaced it with another one - TV system is a little screwy - once again, you expect a little more - Water facing is NOT Bay/Ocean view - it is the intracoastal for the most part. - Balconies - facing the river is great, look to the side to get a bay view (from where we were staying) BUT because of all the high rise buildings, noise is AMPLIFIED (traffic, the bridge warning going up/down, screaming bridge lady, boats, people) if you spend a lot of time on the balcony, as we did, it is VERY noisy. Also, the noise from Area 31 and the pool is also very loud (especially at night) - HOWEVER - if the balcony doors are closed, you don't hear anything!! - Housekeeping does need to go out on the balconies and wipe down the tables occasionally - no one ever did this while we were there.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee, United States", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous property\u201d", "Author": "Cory C", "ReviewID": "UR118910192", "Content": "Stayed at the EPIC Saturday, Sept. 24.

We booked this hotel base on the review on tripadvisor and the reviews are absolutely true. We booked the club level city view and was very please with the room. The room was clean, nice and gorgeous! The club lounge had different snacks and appetizers throughout the day. From 7-11 they had continental breakfast (ham, turkey, pastries, oj's, coffee, milk, cereal). from 11-3pm were more appetizers ranging from fruits to stuff shredded beef in eggroll shellss (it's very good!). and there are just more food throughout the whole day. We were totally full from eating at club level and didnt' even eat much outside. Zuma lounge was very romantic and elegant, the food was great and the ambiance was very cozy later into the night it also turns into a really cool lounge. Loved it!! At club level we had so many friendly staff: Lucia, Oscar and some others that i can't remember their names but they were all so friendy and accomodating. Oscare helped us out by telling us where to rent cheap cars, where to go and etc. They are very please to help us and always have a smile on their face. I love this place and would totally book again and recommend to my friends.

This was my first stay at the Epic and enjoyed it overall. I would probably never stay here except for business as there is not much to explore in the area and I would think that most ourism go to South beach and more touristy bits of Miami. It wasn't my first choice but had to book last minute and Viceroy was full. The Good: - spacious room and bathroom with separate toilet, shower and lots of towels; large closet; complimentary water bottles and fruits upon in room upon arrival - great bayside view from the room that I had; enjoyed the sunrise and sunset every day directly from the room - tasteful modern hotel - nice pool area with various style of lounging chairs, complimentary magazines and water - excellent food at both restaurants (Area 31 and Zuma) - your own goldfish in the room to keep you company - overall friendly staff throughout the hotel and follow-up to minor complaints (see below regarding movie and waterbottles) - little extras such as coffee/tea offered in the morning and wine between 17:00-18:00. I usually had meeting outside so did not make use of these but had the impression that plenty of people did. Having said this, there was no coffee or teamaker in the room. Maybe because it's offered in the lobby in the morning? - broad selection of amenities in the room or that can be ordered; very useful since my suitcase did not arrive with me! - convenient location to Brickell ave for business travellers; it took me 15' to walk to the office. It's a very pleasant walk but some mind find having to cross the bridge a bit of a bother (especially when it's open and you have to wait). Next door is Viceroy just on the other side of the bridge making it perhaps more convenient and slightly closer to most offices down brickell ave The Bad : - limited roomservice: stayed for 10 nights and got a bit boring after few days having to choose from small menu. Concierge can provide takeaway menus but I had to wait too long for this to be brought up so ended ordering roomservice again - Zuma does not provide roomservice and not possible to go down and pick up the food yourself either. Dissappointing! I was told that this was because of US litigation risk (raw food)...and Zuma also operates separately from the hotel - none of the HD movies can be played. They are aware of this issue but nevertheless keep the HD movies on the menu. I had to call reception, wait for technician to show up only to tell me that he's aware of the problem and nothing can be done. I was assured that the movie, that I could not watch, would not be billed but this still ended up on my bill when checking out - open water bottles (even if almost full) would be removed and thrown out by housekeeping; irritating. I was told that guests expect this to be cleared up??! After complaining the second time this happened I did receive lots of complimentary bottles - food offered at poolside is the usual snacks, nothing special - less choice for the leisure traveller in walking distance Conclusion: Overall great experience with minor complaints and might stay again at the Epic for business but will try the Viceroy next time. Would not choose this hotel for leisure travel. Highly recommend trying the Zuma restaurant.

You'd never know that unless you were paying close attention. Floors 2-13 are residences, 14-30 is hotel, and 31-42 is more residences. This fact is unobtrusive to hotel guests, however, since residents have their own entrance and elevators. The professional nature of all the staff, and more importantly the efficiency and caring they show impressed me. The staff at the pool will help you settle in by assisting with towels, a cool glass of lemon water, or adjusting shades. The concierge in this hotel was so efficient at making restaurant reservations (even if the restaurant you want is not on their \"list\") that the whole process took seconds, rather than minutes. I was stunned! Take a walk along the Miami River and Biscayne Bay towards the port, walk left to the park, at night. This is a wonderfully romantic and nice thing to do in the evening! The view from the balconies themselves (that's right, two balconies, even the bathroom in the suites have their own balcony) are totally amazing. It's fun to watch the draw bridges open and close as barges and different watercraft come through the channel. The bedroom in the suite had a floor to ceiling bow window on an entire wall overlooking the city! Beautiful... beyond words.

Lauderdale, and it was a spectacular way to end our vacation. We laid in a cabana (free) by the pools and ordered from the restaurant/bar outside and it was just so beautful and relaxing. One note, it is a relatively new construction, so in 2 different times when we took a cab around the area, the cab driver did not know where he was going and tried to rack up all these charges for driving around. Make sure you keep the address and if possible, a little map with you so that you won't have this experience. Also, this hotel is in downtown Miami. It is not in South Beach. A cab ride from the hotel to South beach is about $20", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201can epic stay!\u201d", "Author": "Design-Family", "ReviewID": "UR117309044", "Content": "Adding to what others have posted, the key to this outstanding hotel is the people who run it.

(Aug 14 -Aug 18) Due to our work schedules, vacations come far and in between so I spend hours searching the Internet and reading TripAdvisor to ensure the right choice for a little R & R. Two years ago, we had the pleasure of staying at a luxury hotel located in BAL Harbor and loved it immensely but for this trip, we decided to stay somewhere more centrally located. I always book our trips through Expedia and discovered an Epic special; book three nights, get the fourth night free. I took the advice of a TripAdvisor reviewer and selected the Club Level as well as a room with a water view and my husband and I both agree that we could not have made a better choice. The property is beautiful! We arrived around noon, greeted by warm smiles and much to our delight, able to check in early. Our bell hop, Christian, a pleasant and jovial young man escorted us to our room, explaining every nook and cranny and then, on to the Club Lounge, where we were introduced to the Concierge on duty who was equally cordial. He asked if we would like a glass of champagne, to which we happily accepted. Our room on the 29th floor was immaculate, spacious enough and had a lovely view of the bay and downtown. From the balcony, we could look below to the 16th floor pools and the outdoor sating for hotel restaurant, Area 31 That first day we dined there for both lunch and dinner. The food was fresh and tasty but dinner selections were limited and a tad over priced. After dinner, we went for a stroll along the bay. The Epic is situated near a few other hotels, office buildings, condos, restaurants, and the Bay Marketplace (shopping for all budgets and affordable eating). If you love the water but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessary need or care for the beach, this IS the place. That night, we returned to the Club Lounge and finished the day with yet more champagne. The next day we took full advantage of the Club Lounge, which offers continental breakfast, a light lunch, healthy snacks, evening hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeuvres, and desserts from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Coffee, bottled water and soft drinks are self serve as well as the bar featuring premier liquors from 6pm to 11pm. In addition, you can request a drink anytime during the day and the staff will graciously get what you desire. The Lounge staff is absolutely phenomenal and they have the knack of making each guest feel special. I would be remiss if I did not mention our concierge, J.P. and our waiter, Mark H. Wow! I can not possibly say enough about how each of them helped to make our vacation a memorable experience. As I said before, we took full advantage of the Club Level amenenities so instead of sitting by the pool in the intense heat; we spent our afternoons in the Club Lounge. Most of time, we were the only guests there and we were treated like royalty. Mark waited on us hand and foot. He kept our glasses filled and personally made us some of the best mojjtos we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever tasted. Through conversation, Mark discovered my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love of food and cooking and from that point on, had numerous suggestions on where we could eat as a local and even shared some recipes of his own. J.P., one of our concierges was equally helpful; from making a delicious watermelon mojito, dinner reservations for us, arranging transportation and great conversation as well. On our last day, we were a little mournful as we prepared to leave; it felt as if we were leaving new found friendships behind. Before we hugged Mark goodbye, he had us sign up to become Kimpton InTouch members so that when we return (which we definitely will do), we will receive even more perks.

I love everything about this hotel. From the gracious welcome I received when first stepping out of the the taxi to the reception area, to the hotel room itself. I travel quite frequently and am not crazy about staying in hotels as I'm very picky about cleanliness. I never stay in anything less than four stars and have found that sometimes five star hotels can leave something to be desired. However, I have never had to worry about cleanliness at this hotel. The beds are clean and comfortable and the bathrooms are luxurious, but most importantly clean as well! Although most of the nightlife and action is located in Miami Beach, this hotel is located in Downtown Miami. However, for me the short taxi ride back and forth is worth all the amenities and comforts this hotel has to offer. The advantage to staying at this hotel versus one comparable to it on Miami Beach is the significant cost savings and being \"away from the party\" atmosphere.\" I love, love to party and most nights am out until at least 6 am (or later if I've been at Space), but I want to come home to peace and quiet, not more partying. Although this hotel is billed as great for business travelers, it is also ideal for singles, groups of friends or a girl's weekend. There are plenty of young people staying at this hotel to mingle with at the pool or perhaps share a cab ride with to Miami Beach (although there is never a wait for a cab, except on New Year's Eve). The hotel inside and out is absolutely stunning. You will never tire of all of it's various views of downtown Miami. Service is impeccable with pool boys available for your every request. Sometimes, they'll know what you need, before you do! Both on site restaurants are excellent and are highly recommended! However, I did have a not so pleasant experience at the spa. I booked a pedicure service and the technician was over 40 minutes late getting to me. I brought this to the attention of the spa director who offered to charge me only half of the cost.

I have to give a shout-out to B at the front desk, because he was incredibly helpful and attentive despite our super late arrival. He walked with us several blocks to ensure we were pointed in the right direction to get a late-night dinner. He even followed up with us later in the weekend. We were totally impressed by his courtesy and he is doing a great job of representing the hotel staff! The room itself was lovely, and the bathroom was amazing...spacious and luxurious. And what a view from the balcony! I wish we had more time to spend at the hotel! It was also quiet despite there being several large groups staying down the hall from us. I loved the gym and the breakfast in Area 31 was also great--again, staff was extremely courteous and pleasant. We were just so happy with our experience overall, I would definitely recommend this to my friends and would likely come back here again. The only downside to the whole thing was the price, but given the quality of everything else, I would rather pay to stay here than pay comparable prices at a possibly sketchy motel on Miami Beach.

We were there just to relax by the pool and have some quality time with family. It was perfect. We knew that the reviews had been excellent, but we were even happier than we expected to be. First of all, the fact that it is a pet-friendly hotel, is amazing. We have English bulldogs who we love to travel with, but rarely can. We had tried to find a pet-sitter when planning our trip, but we couldn't find anyone. Imagine our happy surprise when the first ranked hotel on TripAdvisor was actually pet friendly (with no weight limit or fees!). Well, as if that wasn't nice enough, when we arrived, there was a chalkboard sign out front that had a cute caricature of a dog and said \"Welcome Daisy and Cappy\" with a container of dog treats and a water bowl! What an amazing and thoughtful gesture that made us feel so special. The hotel staff from the front desk to the valets were all so welcoming, not only to our dogs, but to us and our two young kids. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were initially surprised because it was such a hip place with a decent night-time crowd, yet the staff did not make our family of children and dogs feel out of place in the lobby. Our room was impeccably clean and comfortable. We stayed in a \"city view\" room, which I'm used to in some hotels being a view of a building about 10 feet away, but it was a beautiful view of the city. I'm sure the water view is lovely too, but we enjoyed our view of the lights of Miami at night. The bathroom was very large. The dimmer switch was great to keep some soft light on at night. The kids loved that they could see the TV from the great bathtub. I know this is going to sound superlative, but the shampoo and conditioner in the room were amazing. My hair is softer than it's been since we moved to Florida and it began its subjection to constant sun, humidity, and chlorine. I used it all up during our stay, and now I'm kicking myself that I didn't bring the tubes home with me or retain the name of the brand! I meant to bring them home, and not doing so is my only regret! The pool area on the 16th floor was gorgeous.

When we first got to the pool area both days, the attendants brought terry cloth chair covers and towels, as well as ice water. Then we just relaxed at the pool all day! The poolside food and beverage service was great. There is nothing better than sitting in the pool with a mojito, and the yummy chicken quesadillas hit the spot for lunch after a morning of sun and swimming. When we first got to the pool area in the morning, we worried a little bit that our kids (and my husband) splashing about would be annoying for the quieter crowd of adults / couples who were reading and sunning before lunchtime, but we tried not to be too noisy, and the number of kids and families definitely picked up by afternoon. We didn't feel like we were too loud or out of place for more than a few minutes (and nobody at the pool made us feel like this...I was just being hypersensitive, since I also value quiet relaxation when I'm traveling without my kids). The poolside food and drink service was intermittently a little slow, but the politeness and friendliness of the attendants more than made up for the wait. It was busy, both the pool area and the adjacent bar, so it was completely understandable that there was a bit of a wait....and the attendants were all clearly working very hard (and as for it being busy, we never felt like there were people lining up wanting our chairs or that the pool was too crowded, at all....it was just busy, not crowded). We never had any trouble getting chairs, but if it had been more crowded, we would have probably opted to rent one of the many poolside cabanas with comfy couches, some with flatscreen TVs. One thing we loved about the pool (that perhaps avid sunbathers would not) is that the sun goes behind the hotel midafternoon, so one of the 2 pools is more shady at that point. There was a lovely breeze, and we had gotten so much sun all mornng, the shade was welcome and allowed us to enjoy the pool for the rest of the afternoon as well. On to dinner! We had what my sister-in-law has dubbed a \"beautiful dinner' at Area 31 restaurant. Again, we were 4 adults with 3 kids under 5 years old, yet they didn't make us feel out of place or unwanted at all, despite that fact that it is not necessarily the type of restaurant that we would go to with kids if we were home....it would be a \"get a babysitter\" type of restaurant, which is why we so appreciated how welcoming they were of our kiddos, since we didn't have a sitter with us in Miami. The children were pretty well-behaved, and loved the food (my son told us, \"I like fancy dinners\" afterward). Everything was delicious, and our waiter made excellent recommendations. I may have to return to the hotel if not for all the other good reasons, but just to have the amazing polenta side dish again! Sunday was checkout day, and we were so sad to leave. Once again, the hotel was incredibly accommodating and allowed us to have a late checkout, so we could enjoy the pool a little bit longer. When it was time to go, our dogs once again got an energetic goodbye pet from many staff members in the lobby, our children sadly waved goodbye, and it was time to go. We will certainly be back, and we were so impressed with the experience that we've decided to stay at only Kimpton hotels when we vacation in DC and NYC this fall! I hope other locations might use the same brand of shampoo and conditioner, and I'll actually remember to write it down this time! I use Trip Advisor all the time to pick hotels, but I've never written a review until now....the EPIC inspired me to do so!

So the key has clearly not been magnetised by my phone but still does not work in the elevator. Today when I wanted to change the room key because it failed again in the elevator, a new problem presented itself. According to the receptionistI had apparently checked out on day 2 of my 3 day stay. Well, NO! Instead of fixing her useless booking system the robot receptionist asked for my ID and whether I had made 2 bookings, treating me like I am the idiot.

It takes a lot to impress me. The Epic Hotel impressed me from the moment I got out of the taxi. We arrived by taxi and were greeted and escorted in with our luggage. The bellman stayed with us while we checked in and stayed with us until we reached our room. Once we were in our room, he showed us where everything was located and showed us how to work everything. He then escorted us the the Concierge Level and told us about the 5 daily meal presentations, the open bar and happy hour. We went back to our room and looked stood on the balcony which over looked the water!!! It was beautiful!!!!! The room was clean and beautiful, the bed was comfortable and don't get me started on the shower. It was awesome. We signed up for their Intouch Loyalty Program and was allowed to use the laptop which was in the room for free!!!! We were also allowed to get $10 worth of items from the mini bar (for free) just by signing up for the loyalty program. The 5 meal presentations were great!!! The last presentation of the day were deserts. I had the best lemon meringue pie ever. I can honestly say that was the best lemon meringue pie I have ever tasted. The pool was really nice and beautiful. During happy hour, I had the best Sangria ever! I enjoyed the meal presentations, sangria, the room, the view and the list goes on. What stood out to me the most and truly impressed me was the service. The Epic has the best service that I have ever experienced. Everyone was so eager to meet your every need. Upon check-in, we were asked if we were celebrating anything. We told them it was our anniversary. We returned from dinner and found a nice bottle of Champagne and a beautiful card congratulating us waiting in the room. My review is all over the place but I want to make sure I don't leave anything out. We were going on a cruise and were not allowed to board the boat until 1:30 so we were granted a late check-out. We enjoyed our stay so much, we wanted to cancel our cruise and stay at the Epic the entire week (true statement). We reluctantly went on our cruise. Upon returning from our cruise, we had several hours to spend in Miami before our plane departed. We called the Epic and they allowed us to bring our luggage to the hotel to hold it for us so we would not have to carry it with us and we could enjoy more of Miami.

Maybe the hotel should considering making this another bar area to spread things out even more. If you wanted something that was not there, the staff would promptly get it for you.

The main good and not so good points are summarised below: GOOD POINTS Hotel service was amazing, staff were attentive, friendly and very helpful without exception. Mark and Lucia in the club lounge deserve a special mention - nothing was too much trouble. Room quality was very good, ours was a club suite so we had loads of room, very well equipped with a large balcony. Room cleanliness was also excellent. Food and drinks from the club lounge were also superb - to be honest if you're not that hungry you can snack in the club lounge all day for free without needing to spend anything at restaurants - we did this when we were based around the pool. Pool area was lovely, lots of varied seating and lying areas and pool temperature(s) were just right for me Views from the hotel across the bay were amazing. Value for money was about right I'd say given the quality of the room and free access to food and drink Restaurants in the area were good and varied (Indian, Peruvian (highly recommended). We didn't try the hotel restaurants - they were quite expensive. Also we really enjoyed the Blue Martini bar in Mark Brickell area (happy hour 4pm to 8pm)! NOT SO GOOD POINTS Location was fine but would have been nicer to be closer to South Beach. The only practical way to South Beach from the hotel is by cab forabout $25 ($50 return) therefore making it pretty expensive for frequent visits.

We enjoyed both our breakfasts and an amazing dinner. Dining out in Miami is expensive and this was no exception, but at Area 31, we got a much better meal for the money. The innovative cuisine at dinner was especially memorable - among the best meals I have had anywhere recently.

It is located in the heart of Miami with gorgeous views of the Miami River and the downtown area. The room was well appointed with desktop computer/desk in the livingroom, flat screen tvs in both the bedroom and livingroom, rain shower and tub in the bathroom, and a balcony in the bathroom and livingroom! The view from the bedroom was amazing! The bed faced a wall that was a full window from the ceiling to the floor! It faced the rooftop of the JW Marriott next door, which had a pool! We were tucked away in a corner room, so it was very quiet, with no noise from other guests' rooms. We had the feeling that we were in our own little world! The club level has a lounge where we could get snacks and breakfast in the morning. We had a full breakfast at the hotel restaurant downstairs, but we did have some of the chocolate that was laid out the night before...yummy! There are two pools, sitting next to each other. One is heated, the other is not. We used the heated pool and it was just wonderful! Service at the pool was just ok! The server apparently dropped a few things on her uniform blouse and didn't bother to change, so I didn't think it was a good look for such a classy hotel. Also, although there were just a few people at the pool, our server took a bit of time getting everything together-from having us place our order to delivering the order, etc. Also, as well, my husband had to send her back to find out what kind of cheeses were on the cheese platter. She seemed content to tell him she didn't know when asked. I'm thinking the proper response would have been, \"I'm not sure, sir, but I will find out for you.\" Also, I ordered the chips and salsa, which came with chips, salsa, and sour cream. I later asked for more salsa and she never bothered to ask if I'd also like more sour cream...It seems picky, but those are the things that stand out to guests, especially one like me, that writes reviews all the time. It's the little things and attention to detail that make a difference. Speaking of the service...My husband was not pleased, since he'd made arrangements to surprise me the month before and even drove down to the hotel to make sure everything was just right. Everything was confirmed several times, yet, when we arrived, the room was not ready, the Club Level attendant seemed confused as to whether we had a reservation or not, and the champagne and birthday treat was not in the room when we arrived, as was previously discussed and confirmed. I had a massage at the spa, which was really relaxing and nice! They have a sauna and a steam room, which I used before the massage. The steam room was a bit different. It didn't get that foggy, steamy, like others, instead it was just a really warm room, with very light steam. There was a waiting room, which had lounge chairs and complimentary water and tea, plus neck pillows that were in a warmer and felt so good on my neck! I thought that was a nice touch! My massage therapist did a good job. I had a deep tissue, but she did it more like a deep swedish, which was fine, since it was so relaxing. Overall, I had a lovely time at the hotel and would rate it higher, if it weren't for the service.

The club level food at the 5 daily food presentations is nice and tasty, and the ability to have continuous free drinks, spirits and soft drinks is a real benefit and worth the extra for the club level The Club level concierges are helpful and knowledgeable on tourist information as well as local information (with recommendations for dinners etc) and there is a real personal touch in the Club Lounge. The hotel is located on the bay, and is on the waterfront. There is a pharmacy within 2 blocks (i.e. 2-3 mins walk) and the metro/monorail station is very close by too. Biscayne Bay market is about a 10 minute walk and has some touristy shops and places to eat.

Given the price we paid, we would say its very good value for money, especially compared to south beach and would recommend it to anyone wanting to stay down town. A couple of tips - if you want to go see the aligators at the everglades, we'd recommend using Coopertown - they were really good. Its about a 30-40 min drive to the everglades from the Hotel and worth it. Secondly if you want to go to the Keys, its a good 3.5 hour drive to Key West.

Had asked for a crib for my infant son and it was ready and waiting along with the rail guards ( one of the few hotels I have stayed at which provides them). The neutral colours and the calm decor really made a difference. Lobby is very minimalist in design and the hotel tries hard at not being just another tower of concrete in the Biscayne area. The view of the marina was great. THe pic of the pool looks like this when there is no one around. Also, the restaurant is a bit pricey as the breakfast menu is al la carte - there was no buffet.

We booked a room on the club floor which I would recommend as the club lounge is one of the best attractions of this hotel in my opinion. First impressions of the hotel were not great as due to bad traffic we were dropped a couple of blocks away and had to drag our cases up past a group of hotel staff who were stood chatting at the front entrance and not one offered to help us even though we made it right to the front desk. We had just arrived from the UK so this was a shame as we wanted to be wowed as soon as we stepped on to the premises. The room we were allocated was perfect, great views, large and very comfortable with all the usual 5* conveniences you would expect to find. What makes any hotel different from the next is its staff and Mark in the club lounge was exceptional, while I had a little moan early on about our arrival any negative thoughts quickly evaporated as Mark made us feel at home right away and feel comfortable using what the club lounge had to offer. Mark was a fountain of knowledge and any question about Miami we had he either knew or would find out for us. Mark also has the ability to make good cocktails and we enjoyed the kir royales in celebration of that lovely royal wedding he made. I should also mention Reuben who also was invaluable to our restaurant booking requests, both of these members of staff were some of the best we had experienced and are a credit to the hotel.

Don't get me wrong a lot of other hotels are nice in an old money, pretentious \"allow me to change into my smoking jacket before you hand me my my brandy and pipe\" sort of way but Kimptons have a different and better feel with the same level of luxury. I've never had a bad experience at one of their hotels and each trip reinforces why Kimpton is one of the only companies I feel any loyalty to at all. The staff always goes out of their way to do whatever they can to make you feel like they value your business and the people at the Epic hotel are no exception.

My wife and I did not want to let our honeymoon end so we chose to stay a night in Miami on the way home. I booked on their website and was impressed with the govenment rate. I also mentioned on the comments section of the reservation that it was the last night of our honeymoon. I thought at the time it would receive zero notice, but I was wrong. When checking in they excitedly remarked that it was our last honeymoon night and were genuinely excited for us, especially \"B\" who told us he was able to get us a room upgrade. We headed for the elevators but were stopped by Danys, who checked us in. She asked if we'd be interested in a complimentary massage. Uh yes, who wouldn't? She also asked what time our flight was the next day. I told her 6pm and was hoping to have a place to keep our luggage after check-out. She said how about a 3pm or so checkout instead? I couldn't believe the lengths they went to make us feel special. We were amazed at the views from our 22nd floor suite. The floor to ceiling curved windows in the bedroom gave an unbelievable nighttime view, as did the balcony off the west end. We enjoyed a quiet outdoor seafood dinner at Area 31. The waiter, Robert, was superb with explaining each dish and attending to us. When he heard it was our honeymoon, we were again surprised. This time it was a complimentary glass of champagne. He was in no rush to get us out of the restaurant even though it was past closing time. The next morning we we had room service breakfast. When Bruno heard later it was our honeymoon, he returned with two complimentary mimosas. We could not believe the attention paid to us throughout our short stay and the thoughtfullness to make our last night so memorable. We enjoyed the outdoor pool area with drinks, soaking up the last bit of sun before heading back to colder weather. We will be heading back to stay here again when we are in Miami. If you are going on a Caribbean honeymoon and don't want to rush home, stop here for the night on your way home.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that the hotel was having an off weekend, but in general, my stay did not reflect the other high ratings and accolades in previous posts. As my title mentions, undoubtedly the EPIC has wonderful facilities and is an excellent property, but the service standards need to be seriously improved if it is to call itself a true luxury hotel. The strengths of EPIC were in the facilities and general plant. EPIC is a newer property and the attention to thoughtful design is evident throughout the hotel. The lobby is airy and spacious, modern yet inviting. Hallways were well-lighted, and even though my room was at the end of the hallway, it was never too far a walk from the elevator. I had the opportunity to stay in a one bedroom suite on the EPIC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s club level. The suite was extremely sizeable and well designed, a large balcony facing out toward the Brickell business corridor and another smaller balcony off the bathroom facing inland. Bedding was of high quality, and the room was well furnished. Soundproofing was sufficient, but I could hear music pulsing from the restaurant downstairs on some evenings. My major issue was with the cooling system. The suite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bedroom faced northeast, and with floor to ceiling windows, it meant the that bedroom was extremely warm from 1pm onward. One has to set the air conditioner to a very low temperature (60 degrees or so) to cool the bedroom properly. This meant that oft times the living area was very cool while the bedroom was always slightly too warm. Service, as I mentioned previously in my post, was wildly uneven, and more often bad than good. Probably the worst on the scale were the valets and bellman, who I often think of as the front line hotel staff, more so than the front desk. More often than not I had serious service challenges with the valets and front door staff. Cars took a very long time to be retrieved \u00e2\u20ac\u201c usually 15-20 minutes. After calling down for my car, and taking 10 minutes to go downstairs, I found myself waiting an additional 10 minutes for my car to be retrieved. The phone operator manning the valet station placed me on hold for so long on one occasion I had to call the front desk so someone there could relay a message to the valets to have my car brought up. The one occasion out of 12 that my car actually showed up by the time I got to the driveway, the valets parked my car on the far opposite side of the parking circle and just handed me the keys, leaving me to dodge incoming cars to get to it. Lastly the only time I could remember a doorman opening the door and greeting me was on the last day of my stay. There are basic service standards not being met, and I would recommend that hotel management take the time to observe the operations of the valet and door staff and make necessary improvements in service level training. The club, which should be the epitome of high service standards, was also very unevenly staffed. The continental breakfast during the weekend could only be described as chaos. Tables were not serviced, so guests were standing around waiting for seats; coffee, juice, and milk were gone by 9am and were not replenished; staff were so overwhelmed in the small back kitchen they were not available for other guest requests. I became so frustrated that I decided not to visit the club in the mornings again, other than to grab a newspaper. Overall my sense was the club was not sufficiently staffed for the volume of guests \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one concierge simply was not enough to service all the guests. As a point of reference, most club lounges of similar size to which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been usually have 2-3 concierges on staff. I was not able to have a basic perk of the club, which was the ability to check-in and check-out of the hotel at the club lounge, simply because the concierge desk was often overwhelmed. I would not recommend potential guests to pay extra money to stay at the EPIC club level unless the hotel management made improvements in hotel staffing. I do have to recognize the good service from one of the concierges on staff, who was there both on the Saturday and Sunday nights of my stay, who really provided exceptional service. The housekeeping staff generally was good, but again, there were some areas that needed some serious attention. Dirty dishes left by guests in the hallways often remained there for most of the day, picked up only at the appointed room servicing times. While from an operational efficiency standpoint I can understand why that was so, but it was really unpleasant to see dirty dishes sitting in the hallway for half the day. Probably the strongest link in the service \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were the front desk staff. Overall I found them to be highly professional, courteous, and efficient. More often than not, when I had a problem or need, I would call the front desk instead of the club concierge, simply because I knew that they would be far more responsive. If only hotel management could extend the quality of service I received at the front desk throughout the hotel, it would truly be a winning property. Again, this review is my personal experience, and it could have been an exceptionally busy weekend that deviated from the norm, but overall I had a disappointing stay at the EPIC and could not recommend it to fellow travelers until the service standards are seriously improved.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, OH", "Title": "\u201cTotally surpassed our expectations!!\u201d", "Author": "ilovebooks", "ReviewID": "UR108488398", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the epic for a conference and we were completely impressed!

This time I decided to try Epic on a heavily discounted rate. I was expecting a lot as I had read all the TA reviews. I was not disappointed! finding the hotel was a little challenging as my GPS lost lock in amongst the high rises but got there eventually. Valet parking attendant very abrupt but he did his job well, just not great on customer niceties if I had to be picky. Parking $32. Check-in very easy and swift, surprised to find my rate included breakfast (continental) which I was not aware of. Checkin staff told me that because I was checking in late and missed the free wine hour, that I would get a voucher and could claim it for wine at the restaurant later in the evening. Fantastic! My only let down was that I had requested a king bed room, and I got a room with two double beds - fair enough though as I was on a very discounted rate. Bed was still very comfy. Excellent balcony with massive double glazed glass so very quiet inside if you shut the door to the balcony. The bathroom is amazing - his and hers sinks, a bath that you can see the main TV from, a great shower with rain shower head. It had everything! Beautiful amenities, nice mood lighting. Large plasma TV with plenty of channels. The Heat were playing but couldn't find it on any TV channel which was surprising. I made a reservation at Area 31, the main restaurant - could only get in after 9.30pm which was fine, but take heed to book ahead if you want a main slot on a weekend. There is free wifi in the room (just have to join up to InTouch Kimpton) or $10 if you don't want to join. Great speed, eqasy to connect. They also have a computer in every room so you get free internet even if you don't have a laptop. Nice touch. There is an ipod dock sound system, but it only takes the ipod nano, and not an iphone unfortunately. Good blockout curtains too. Excellent fitness centre, with weights, cardio equipment and stretching room with balls etc. Beautiful pools (x3 I think) but didn't get to use them. Checkout was fine, they charged me twice for internet for 24 hours (I couldnt be bothered signing up for Kimpton so paid) but they were happy to remove one of the charges from the bill without asking any questions.

The suite was beautiful and had a large bathroom which made my friends and I quite happy. :-) Prior to our stay, I arranged spa visits for my friends and I. They were fantastic! Melissa at the Exhale Spa gave me a great deep tissue massage. The icing on the cake for my visit involved two people associated with the Club Level. The first is Reuben. He was phenomenal! Not only did he provide fantastic recommendations for our in terms of night life and restaurants, he made sure we were able to dine in some wonderful establishments. He was friendly and thoughtful and made sure we enjoyed everything the Club Level had to offer, including the special food presentations which occurred multiple times throughout the day. He even made me a special smoothie because I'm allergic to pineapple! He went above and beyond! Thank you Reuben. The other person associated with the Club Level is Mark. Also, friendly and quite the connoisseur of a variety of beverages. He made sure there was champagne and chocolate waiting for my friends and I when we returned from birthday festivities! Thanks so much Mark! These three individuals provided excellent service (the rest of the staff was also quite wonderful) and truly made my birthday weekend special. At one point in time, we did walk around the surrounding area of the hotel.

When an unexpected experience comes along that really knocks my socks off, as one did this past weekend at the Epic Hotel Miami (a Kimpton Hotel), I feel I really must share this example of excellence. The trip down to Miami started with long flight delays due to severe thunderstorms, and, following the cancellation of the flight, ended with an impromptu car rental and four hour drive. Upon arrival at the Epic, we were tired, frustrated, and ready to pack it in. However, there was just enough time to dash up to the room, change, and dash back out to our appointment. Thank goodness check in was fast and friendly, and the room was even better than expected. I arrived 30 mins. too late for the breakfast seating the next morning, and lunch seating wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t begin for another 30 minutes. Ah well, to the pool bar I went, hoping to round up something tasty. At this point I was starving and happy to munch on an orange wedge. We were greeted by Cesso, the attendant, who told us that breakfast had ended but that he would be happy to see if the Chef wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind preparing us a few eggs. Within minutes, Cesso had taken an ordinary poolside table and created one of the best breakfast experiences I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had . . . complete with omelets, pastries, amazing coffee, linens, and fresh fruits. Ok, that was pretty cool. He then lingered to tell us a little about the area and make sure we were satisfied with our meal. After breakfast, the weather had turned sunny and I decided to work by the pool. Cesso again appeared, selected the perfect spot, set up my chair cover, headrest, and umbrella, and brought over some fresh water. Within minutes of getting settled in, the weather turned stormy and Cesso was there in an instant. He quickly offered the complimentary use of one of the beautiful poolside cabanas, where I could continue to work during the rain. Once the storm passed, he set up new chairs by the pool and, not wanting to leave his great care, we ordered lunch in the afternoon. Here I was, in Biscayne Bay Miami, with hundreds of great restaurants within easy access, and I would up having lunch by the pool three days in a row. I know, it sounds excruciating. My point is that the atmosphere was beautiful, the food was excellent, and the service was amazing. The entire experience was so positive, I had no need to go in search of anything else (at least until dinner!) Over the course of my four night stay, I continuously encountered Kimpton staff members who went out of their way to treat me as if I were a welcome friend. The guest reception employees were warm and friendly, the valet and hotel front door attendants never failed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153welcome me back\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or wish me a pleasant day, and I just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say enough about Cesso. Happily buzzing around the pool area (and working his tail off), attending to each guest as if they were his only concern, he may have just set a new standard in guest experience. He may also be one of the Kimpton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest assets. I have always enjoyed staying at a Kimpton hotel, but this stay certainly sealed the deal.

Great room, over looking the pool area and view of the bay. Thought it might be too noisy just 2 floors above the pool, but it was fine, even at night with functions going on. The rooms are spacious with the most comfortable beds we have experienced of any Kimpton hotel. NOt sure if they are any different, or the surroundings made them more enjoyable. Check in was smooth -- Michael the bell captain told us everything there is to know about the hotel, got us hooked up to the free internet for both our laptop and for the mini-PC in each room (this is a great feature when you just want to surf the web and not be distracted by work emails and files on your laptop) Kimpton Hotels have a complimentary wine hour each night, but we found something even better. The bar was offering a Veuve ARound the Clock promo, $5 champagne at 5pm, $6 a glass at 6, all the way until 9pm. Not everyone at the bar knew the details of the promo, but they quickly accomodated the proper pricing. One of the great features of EPIC is their 16th floor pooldeck. The deluxe cabanas are built into the overhang and have a bed, chaises and a flat screen TV and very attentive wait staff. Nice view of the bay as well. On the bayside of the deck are more modest cabanas that face the pool, though you could spin around and view the water. We reserved one of the bayside cabanas one day -- I think it is $125 -- and the Pool Concierge greeted us and immediately escorted us to a Deluxe -- \"We are not very busy today, so please accept the upgrade complimentary\" -- Now that is good service. As we spoke with him throughout the course of the day, we learned this was his first week on the job. The people at Kimpton Hotels make the diffrence between them and the big boxes, and this was exhibit A. Only wish I could remember his name, but I did mention to the GM who we encountered at wine hour one evening. Dinner at AREA 31 was delish. Seafood was what we were after, and they did not disappoint. Tasty, simply prepared, very flavorful. Glad we gave it a try after passing on prior visits. The dining highlight, not just of the trip, but probably of the year, was ZUMA in the lobby. Internationally renowned, this place rocks. Booked solid on a weeknight, and it is easy to see why. Despite a major glitch in our reservations, a manager bucking to be the next Pierce Brosnan cut through the mess and got us seated straight away without so much as an excuse. Zuma is a must -- not just the food, which is an amazing twist on asian fare -- but the service was impeccable. Dinner was like a choreographed event, with no less than 7 different staff members doing something for us, all without missing a beat or being disjointed or awkward, but yet the same waitress came by with good frequency to check in on us. The BBQ pork bellies are a sin worth committing, as is just about everything on the menu. In typical Chinese style, the food is meant to be shared, so grab your friends and let the staff guide you. Also grab your wallet, we are talking $$$ to match the experience, but well worth the price of admission. The only quirks to EPIC is its blend of Kimpton and Non-Kimpton aspects. The lobby bar, Zuma and the Exhale Spa/Fitness Center are 3rd party operators, and sometimes it shows. Our Exhale experience was less than polished and the staff seemed indifferent. The Lobby Bar has a strong South Beach attitude about it -- got turned away for wearing sandals -- $250 sandals, but sandals don't cut it in their book. Zuma was fabulous, but we could not charge the services to our room account at the hotel. Also, the pooldeck is a popular function area, more so for outside groups than hotel guests it would seem. Several nights it was closed for private events, which is a drawback since lounging in the poolside furniture at night seeing the lights on the bay with a cool drink is one of the hotel's greatest attractions.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cProbably best hotel stay I've had in a while.\u201d", "Author": "rachelnyc23", "ReviewID": "UR100387465", "Content": "My husband and I decided to take a one night trip to Miami this past weekend while visiting family in Palm Beach.

My husband and I went to the Epic before and after our cruise this past month. The first day/night was incredible, they gave us an early check in, the luggage came over with us, the service was good at the pool, etc. It was a girl friends birthday who was staying in another room and the concierge Andrew was nice enough to run and get her balloons and flowers on a rainy morning! (Though he brought them to her in a cup instead of a vase, but he did really try which was impressive). Now for the second time around the following Saturday. We came in at 11am, the hotel was completely sold out. There was the boat show and several large weddings. The room wasn't ready, which was understandable so we just went to lay down by the pool. They told us they would call when it would be ready. 3:30pm rolls around, no phone call so finally we go to the front desk again. The girl at the front desk was completely overwhelmed. It really seemed like she had no idea what to do. After 20 minutes she found us a room and up we went. We were told our luggage would soon follow as we gave her the tickets to send it up. An hour later, no luggage...I call down and they said they were looking for it and asked who did we give the tickets to!! After another 30 minutes, still no luggage, so I finally ran downstairs. Apparantly the overwhelmed woman left for the day. One of the bellman went on the hunt for our luggage. After another 20 minutes my husband and I decided to peak behind the front desk and there was our luggage right up front! It definitely put a damper on the day as it was about 6:30pm by the time this was resolved! Never the less, they really do try and care which is 99% of it. I am sure they will be amazing in another 6 months or so. We ate at both restaurants, and the pool which were all impressive and delicious, though the portions at both Area 31 and Zuma were tiny. If you go to Zuma you must try the Alaskan King crab legs..TO DIE FOR.. Also the massage with Olivia at the spa was heavenly.. I felt like I was floating after I left!

I admit it. I'm a Kimpton addict. I've had wonderful experiences before. I've bought the package. I expect the best. But this is Miami. Culture shock if you figure this Kimpton is going to square up to those hotels in NYC, Chicago, DC... To be sure, the service, attentiveness, friendly and inviting attitude of this staff is absolutely consistent with other Kimptons. As this was my first journey to Miami, I relied on the expertise of the concierge and desk staff and they were marvelous, spending many minutes with me in conversation about how to navigate the city. Ditto the cleaning and pool staff. If you are looking for amazingly good service, then this is your spot. Why can't Kimpton transport DC, or Chicago to Miami? I must be too old to appreciate the \"clubbing\" experience...Sit outside at the entrance..take in the costume sprawl and everything that is of excess. You will find it here.. Our room was, well, nice. King, with a view of the river, and you can peek at a portion of South Beach with binoculars. Smaller than DC/Chicago rooms, but OK. I get the Ar t Deco thing they are trying to avoid, but play into. Curtained window from the bathtub... Since this is a partnered living space (residents + visitors), you can't stay on the lower floors, so you will be somewhere between sixteen and thirty (those last two floors reserved for those of you who wish to delve into club-level status). Be prepared to keep your room key with you at all times. The elevators demand you swipe your key before proceeding up. 16 is the magic floor---spa/pool/fitness. I will have to say, the pools (there are 2) are amazing...warm and inviting. The staff ever attentive to provide towels and locations for you to spend quality time just chillin'. What's best? The pool stays open. A late evening swim was so relaxing, under a cloudless night. I manged to order pizza and salad and ate and swam and enjoyed. (Pieducks, if you are curious) So what was different? This Kimpton is dislocated...you can't walk out of the front door and expect to get most basic services. It's a three block walk to Starbucks (the only coffee place operating on the weekends), and downtown Miami is, well, still sprouting. Yes, it is safe to walk, but you will have to do that if you'd like a morning Joe other than that which is supplied in the lobby. (Flagler Street does have some interesting eateries--but not on the weekends) You will be a 10 dollar cab ride away from most places that would offer nifty restaurants (and about 30 if you plan to trek to South Beach). But this is Miami. As I was leaving, a photographer was shooting some kind of ad that was either for the hotel, or Porsche. Two models, in ridiculously wool outfits were riding into the hotel in a hot red convertible. It was fun watching this scenario play out, as the legions of cars transporting regular guests were interrupting the flow of this \"shoot.\" It was just another example of the kind of distraction that makes Miami, well, Miami. Oh, and on that jaunt to South Beach, Lil Wayne was sashaying down Ocean Drive with his entourage. Golly, my trip was complete! I would consider this a great place to stay if you have Miami business. If you are trying to catch a deal so you can steal off to South Beach...well...reconsider... One other thing.. I choose not to bring my laptop because there is a computer in every room! But be prepared to wait. The internet connection is SLOW and you need patience if you are accustomed to FAST. The wireless (if you have your own device) works fine.

The suite was fabulous, decorated in a tasteful minimalist modern fashion. Its main balcony overlooked the Miami river estuary and Biscayne bay. There was always some activity on the water to capture your attention. Without exception, the hotel staff were warmly friendly and eager to do our bidding. The club lounge supplied five separate feedings each day, which were ample to provide breakfast and a light lunch. The open bar was kept well-stocked evenings with premium brands such as Hennesy cognac and Glynfiddich whiskey. We ate several times at the Area 31 restaurant in the hotel. The food was tasty and nicely presented, but we felt the menu was way too heavy on fish and lacking on other entrees. The Marriott across the street and the Hyatt a block away had decent restaurants within easy walking distance. One major problem arose: When I initially called to make our reservation, the person at the Kimpton reservation center refused to honor the \"3rd day free\" promotion advertised on the hotel's web site, and I had to email the Epic's manager to get that rate. Then, the person making the actual reservation asked for my credit card number via unsecured email. I declined, attempted to call her without success and finally completed the reservation with the Eic's front desk staff. Weeks later, I called to add a room for guests of ours, and discovered that our reservation had been cancelled! Fortunately, a very pleasant manager at the reservations center reinstated the reservation and all went well afterwards. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Epic and are making plans to return.

There was enough diversity that in staying there for 4 days we were able to find several new options to try. The surrounding neighborhood doesn't offer much but with a place like this, there is no reason to really ever leave the property. The crowd was mixed, but all seemed to co-exist perfectly.

EVERYONE, from the valet, front door attendants, housekeeping, pool attendants, front desks, Area 31, etc, etc, etc and even at Zuma (though management is supposedly not directly the hotel's), every single staff we encountered were almost eerily, creepily sooo nice and were figuratively doing cartwheels for you in their offer to assist you in any way.

The hotel met and exceeded our expectations in every facet. Deservedly, the hotel is ranked #1 in Miami on Tripadvisor. I'd highlight a few points in addition to the comments made in other reviews. Club level: We stayed in a room on the club level and I would highly recommend it. Whatever nominal difference in price per night, you will get your money's worth and then some. At the club lounge, there are five daily 'presentations' of food and fare, including a great continental breakfast (the other four are light lunch, healthy afternoon snack, pre-dinner appetizers, and a pre-bedtime snack). Tons of drinks are available at all times from bottled water to coffee to soda. In addition to the drinks and presentations, there's a great staff up there that will literally take care of whatever you want (Lucia and Raquel are the best of the best). For example, during breakfast, they will make any specialty coffee drink you want (e.g., cappuccino, latte, etc). If you come in between presentations and want something, they will get a snack for you. They also put out a nice selection of top shelf alcohol and a nice selection of wines in the evening for an open bar, so you can pop in before or after dinner and have some drinks. The staff went all out and mixed drinks beyond the realm of totally simple (e.g., a White Russian). Other perks of the club level are a dedicated concierge from 7A-11P and dedicated check out. Again, I would HIGHLY recommend the club level - it was the highlight of our stay. Pool: The pictures on the hotel's website don't do the pool area justice. It is amazing, impeccably maintained, and well staffed. As soon as you get out there, a friendly member of the pool staff will set you up at one of the different poolside options ranging from outdoor sofas to conventional lounge chairs to yin-yang couches to day-beds. They'll bring you a glass of water with fruit and keep it replenished all day. The hotel even thinks of the little things. For example, there's a large selection of sunscreen so if you forgot to bring some or ran out, it's right there for you to use. The hotel's excellent free Wi-Fi works great by the pool, as well. Restaurants: We didn't eat at Area 31 because the outstanding food on the club level is based on the Area 31 menu. I would HIGHLY recommend Zuma, the Japanese restaurant in the lobby. Before eating at Zuma, I would have told you that Nobu in NYC is the best Japanese restaurant. Zuma blows Nobu out of the water! Pretty much everything we had was amazing, but I'd recommend the cod, chicken teriyaki, tuna tataki, and rice bowl. The sushi is so good it makes you say \"Oh, so this is what sushi is supposed to taste like.\" The restaurant is relatively new and hasn't caught on among Tripadvisor reviews yet, but it is extremely trendy and popular. We were lucky to get a reservation for dinner on a Monday night at the last minute, but I'd suggest reserving in advance if you're planning to go. Staff/Logistics: Everyone we encountered from the front desk staff to the doormen were extremely helpful and very courteous. If a random member of the staff happened to be in the elevator at the same time, he/she would ask how our stay is going and whether there's anything they can do to help. We arrived just after 12PM and our room was ready. We requested a late checkout of 2PM and it was granted without a problem. We hope the staff at the Epic keep up the excellent work.

What we loved when we arrived (1/14-1/17): - super friendly & courteous staff (not the least bit pretentious) - beautiful decor in lobby, common areas and rooms - large room and bathroom - free computer/internet - large balcony & beautiful view of river/port - very quiet room - great pool & gym We booked the club level primarily based on reviews on this site. JP welcomed us in the club lounge Friday, and he was great - had wonderful recommendations for restaurants and things to do around town. Lounge had a nice selection of light appetizers and drinks/cocktails (if they didn't have it, they went and got it). Two new concierges Saturday morning, who were also courtous and attentive - one got us into Zuma (the new, \"it\" restaurant, located in the hotel) that night. However, the club level lost some of its lustre as the weekend progressed. Perhaps the hotel chooses not to fully staff the club lounge during certain weekend hours, but we oftentimes found it completely empty - the club conceirge appeared to have been assigned to multiple tasks throughout the entire hotel (i.e. front desk, free wine hour). I understand this from a business perspective, but if we pay an extra $30/night for the service, we'd like to have someone available when we walk in - or at least maybe a note telling us they'll be right back? In general, it was nice to have snacks & drinks during certain times of day (continental breakfast was decent), but I don't think we'd do it again unless the weekend service was improved a bit. Despite the club level's slight deficiency, it was more than made up for by the service provided by Mark. Wow - this guy was great. Upon bringing us anything, he immediately asked \"what else can I get you?\" While we were there, he worked at both the pool and club lounge - always greeted us personally, offered us restaurant recommendations, and generally made us feel very pampered.

When we returned back to Miami we were staying in another location for a few days and we called the Epic several times to see if by chance it had turned up and each time was told no. 3 days the later the local delivery company provided us proof that it had in fact been at the Epic for at least 3 days! When we rang again and told them, they \"found it\" and used the excuss they didn' t have our correct phone number - this is rubbish as we gave it in when we chceked in, it is on my online record, Sonja has it as she called me on it and they also have my email!

I am a frequent guest at 5 star hotels in Asia and rate this hotel superior to most of them - it's a true first-class hotel from start to finish! The building has a perfect location in downtown area and presents an ultramodern city skyscraper overlooking Biscayne Bay - with steel exterior and stylish balconies to all rooms. Interior design is Asian style. The lobby is stunning from the very first moment you step inside being high and spacious - and presenting beautiful details: complimentary corner with coffee and tea, fresh water containers with refreshing aromas (starfruits, mint leaves etc), water fountains, and a stylish lounge with chic divans and huge windows to the terrace of the Japanese restaurant Zuma and the Miami River. The service was second to none. Prior to this visit I have never experienced such kindness and professional touch with customers. We were a family and had booked 3 Club level rooms with a city view. Upon arrival lobby staff greeted us friendly and accompanied us to our private check-in on the 29th floor. Our flight from Europe was massively delayed and our luggage was missing so we arrived exhausted and hungry at a late hour - after long travels. Our hospitable concierge Gene gave us our room keys and assisted with necessary items (toothbrush, razor etc). Then in the lounge we were immediately offered us a glass of wine and beef kebabs - even though the evening food presentation was already over! Gene (the concierge) went downstairs to get some leftovers just for us! What a wonderful service here - thank you so much for this special welcoming gesture! Service was outstanding throughout our stay. The staff and concierges in the Club lounge were all so friendly whenever we saw them. Reuben took a lot of time to locate our missing luggage and took photocopies of papers, wrote a report upon arrival of the luggage etc - thank you so much! Concierges were very helpful and problems with missing luggage really point our why it is great to have such service! The Epic is also gay friendly which is an appreciated touch of tolerance and makes everyone feel welcome. Our guest rooms were spacious and all-in-all top-notch. Huge beds with soft linens, lots of storage for clothing, minibar, iHome for iPhone docking, ironing facilities, large LCD-TV, private computer with free internet access, wireless internet for free (as we were InTouch members) and guest services information, stylish two sink bathroom with separate bathtub, a separate shower closet and toilet - just to name a few... The balcony had a nice view to nearby towers with some sun in the late afternoon. The skyline at night was amazing. Noise isolation was very good and there was an ice machine right down the hallway. We had requested our rooms next to each other but the concierge could not arrange this as the floor seemed to be quite full for the holidays - this was not a problem though. My partner and I exercised daily during our stay. The Epic provides a free running map to all guests. The map has 3 routes in Brickell (to the south) which aren't very good - although you get an idea of the area and see some pretty private houses and gardens. There is a lot of traffic and you have to cross streets - and the skyscrapers make the routes quite shady. We ran all three several times but found out the best way to run outside it to take a taxicab or city bus to South Beach and go running there - with plenty of sunshine and pretty beachfront tracks and/or broadwalks. The gym is located on the 16th floor and is very modern with Technogym machines and free weights - each of the machines being equipped with a private TV screen, iPod docking station, joystick control to adjust your speed/pace. A very good gym with the latest machines - and a fantastic view over the residence side pools! The spa is on the 15th floor and has a free-of-charge hamman steam bath and an infrared sauna. The hammam unluckily didn't have enough steam - but looked cool with star ceiling and was very clean. We liked the sauna more - it had a private CD player/radio and you could also turn off the light to relax. The Spa had wonderful amenities (private lockers, towels, rubber flip-flops, hairspray, deodorant, mouthwash, shampoo, conditioner, skin wash etc - all complimentary to guests). The spa was never crowded. The Epic pools are very stylish. Two large pools with water up to 85F, fab views to the bayside, chic sunbeds and polyrattan divans, complimentary suncreens with different protection factors etc. The pooldeck opens at sunrise and closes at sunset. During our stay the pool hours were inconsistent as on some days they opened the deck even before 6.45am, and on some days not until after 7am. As early birds we had to wait behind closed doors and there was so staff around or a telephone to call the front desk. The heater broke down twice during our stay so sometimes the water in the pools was colder which was a minor disappointment. We had luck with the weather. Staying from Dec 20 for 9 days we had sun everyday. Some days were cool due to an arctic blast in Eastern United States with temps dropping at night close to freezing. At daytime it was warm but sometimes the wind felt a bit too cool though. Pooldeck is quite windy on such days. There is a complimentary wine reception everyday from 5-6pm in the lobby or at the pools. The hotel invites for a glass of red, white or sparkling wine with tuna tartar. A true highlight of our stay was the Club lounge with its extraordinary staff! Thank you so much Lucia, Mark, Oscar, Reuben, Sonja, Raquel, Andrew, and Gene!!! You are the best!! The lounge has 5 different food presentations during the day starting with breakfast from 7 to 11am. Breakfast didn't have much variety but was of a good quality - including bagels and toast, quality cold cuts, cheeses, fresh tropical fruits, muesli and cereals, freshly squeezed orange juice, wonderful organic teas, and coffee. On request we were offered special things like cranberry juice, fresh raspberries and blackberries. Everybody learns your name easily and the service is very personal yet professional. Lucia quickly picked up my favorite tea and kindly brought it to me and always made the mornings special with her warm smile. At daytime you can enjoy yummy canapies such as small pastries, pasta salad, healthy foods etc. Also cookies and sweet cakes. In the evening there are more canapies and sweets, plus a complimentary bar service and you can order cocktails etc. The lounge staff are very courteous. My dad got sick during our stay with a respiratory infection so he was repeatedly offered hot drinks by Mark. I like energy drinks so Mark - again - got some for me - thank you so much for all of this! The lounge is very friendly in design and also good for families with kids - as there is a large iPad like table with games, maps etc. The staff pays attention also to kids. We spent many evenings here - chatting and spending a quality time together. I highly recommend paying the extra for the Club level - it's worth it - especially with the personalized service! Our stay at the Epic indeed exceeded our expectations. I recommend this property to everyone looking for luxury and quality time with family or partner/spouse, and as a city break away from your daily routines. We were not disappointed (even though the minor downsides I mentioned in the review) at all -but positively impressed - and would definitely stay here again!", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Helier, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cReportedly Number 1 in Miami.. not so sure\u201d", "Author": "GaryCI", "ReviewID": "UR91105488", "Content": "Havign arrived at the hotel after taking Tri-Rail from Fort Lauderdale and connecting metro service the front service was none existent.

The room and view were ridiculous!! It was very,very nice!! The view was gorgeous and the room was beautiful. We ventured down to the 16th floor to see the pool area and have a cocktail at Area 31.

We had a fantastic 1 bedroom suite on the 28th floor, complete with gold fish that we named Bob for our stay and this room was stunning!

I want a bathroom like that in my house and 1 bedroom apartments in Cities are smaller than this hotel room! We could have been quite happy living there with Bob and the view however we had a cruise to take! The hotel really does have the wow factor about it everywhere. From free coffee and tea in the morning as you leave the hotel to set out exploring Miami to the free wine in the evening between 5 - 6 pm, you couldn't ask for better. The pool on the 16th floor is luxurious and offers stunning views.

It also offers free internet in the room which was a god send to us to check in for our flights to the UK and also to catch up with the outside world! Bayside is a comfortable walk along the waterfront and does offer you everything you need. The metromover - once we worked out where we were and where we wanted to go is a fantastic way to get around downtown Miami for free and no trip to Miami would be complete without going to South Beach. The main beach front street is stunning with some lovely buildings and hotels - the on street cafes and restaurants were fantastic and not as expensive as you think.

Sincerely, Walter P. ---- I have stayed in a LOT of Hotels. From the $39.95 a night, to the Fairmont\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, InterContinental\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, W\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. But from the time I Valet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d my car, I felt funny. Kind of like I was out of my element. As I found out later, I was. Farah who checked us in, was OUTSTANDING! She relaxed us and made us feel extremely special right off the bat. Her charm, wit and professionalism were so refreshing. She is definitely a keeper! Later we came down to ask the Concierge (Ruben) for directions for something to eat and he was also very knowledgeable and gave us great choices. Unfortunately after we ate my wife became ill. (No fault of the Concierge) While she came back to the hotel, I went to CVS to get her something to help her stomach. This was about 1pm and by the time I arrived back at the hotel, she had a turn for the worse up and continued to do so until nearly 11pm. Inbetween that time, I went back down to the Concierge, (Gene at this time) to ask him if he knew where I could get a small bottle of Club Soda because my wife thought it would make her feel better. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any at CVS earlier and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any in the Minibar. He made one call and said he would take care of it for me. Shortly after that he came to my room personally and delivered the Club Soda to us. WHAT?!!?!? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153HE\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd personally delivered it to us!!! OMG! Ok, so first the Valet, then Farah, then Ruben, then Gene! Ok, I am sad that my wife is ill, but I cannot believe the RIDICULOUSLY FABULOUS Service I am receiving. You WANT great customer service, but generally that is just what it is, a WANT. Anyway, later my wife feels she can hold on to some crackers or toast. So she ask me to call down and see if they have any. I tell her it will be a charge, so I will just walk back down to CVS and get something. She ask me to call anyway. So I call and guess what? Zach from In-Room Dining staff says, sure Mr. Poole, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring her some crackers right away. Now don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask me why, after the great customer service I have already received, I am still reverting back to the ways of the world and I am expecting to get a charge for the crackers. I get a knock on the door and Zach is there with Crackers, TEA (Who thought of that??!!?!) and Honey. He says he thought the Tea might help! I almost got teary eyed because someone actually took an extra minute to THINK about what might help my wife feel better. Oh, and there was no charge! I was so flabbergasted; I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even offer him a Tip. SORRY! There are literally hundreds of hotels to choose from. Trust me, I have stayed at half of them. But because you guys went the extra mile for me and my family, I assure you I will be staying at more Kimptons in the future. I just want to say THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart. And next time we are in Miami, you will see us again. Hopefully without spending so much time in your beautiful room.

Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a 1 Bedroom suite, which was spacious, comfortable and absolutely beautiful (thanks Sean!). The views from the massive balcony on the 28th floor were amazing both day and night. We also thoroughly enjoyed relaxing by the stunning pool on the comfortable lounging sofas. As many others have mentioned, we too found all staff members to be both professional AND super friendly. We found the downtown location of this hotel to be excellent. We did not have a car but were able to easily walk to a number of great local (not chain) restaurants (Fratelli Milano for Italian, Bali Cafe for Indonesian and Cafe Bastille for French). The (free!) Metromover (less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel) is a great way to explore downtown and we also used it to reach the Arsht Center For The Performing Arts for an evening concert.

Everything during my 4 day stay was more than I expected. This is the first time I stayed at such a luxorious hotel during a vacation and it was worth it. I gave 4/5 for location just because obvously there weren't as many exciting places to go to that were walking distance from the hotel, but you will quickly realize when you get in a cab to south beach that you're happy you didnt stay in a sleazy beach hotel! The Epic was extremely accomodating. They open doors, refil your drink after 2 sips, ask how you are doing/if you need anything, etc. I read previous reviews on it being a little pricey. The room itself i think was reasonable, but breakfast/dinner prices were a little up there. However, it is what you pay for everything you get there and is why the hotel keeps up such high ratings. There were also ways to get around the pricey items. For example, thursday when i arrived I was informed about the complimentary wine hour from 5pm to 6pm and then from 5-10 pm was a ladies drink free happy hour. Also, when i made my reservation I was given the option for a $1 complimentary daily breakfast which consisted of 3 different options and included the pricey coffee/juices. Nightlife was a bit limited for my age group, early 20's, but there are select bars nearby and one club in walking distance, Mia. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting exceptional service and the best accomodations when it comes to hotel rooms and poolside comfort.

They acted like they owned the place! In other words, they acted like it MATTERED to them that I had a good time; that I knew all of the perks and treats available, it mattered to them PERSONALLY that my stay was absolutely perfect, and that is what it was. And let's be clear: I'm no Pollyanna glass-half-full starry-eyed optimist; I am a picky, cranky, hard-to-please curmudgeon who ALWAYS gets the room with the last guest's hair in the shower, the snarky front desk clerk, and the unhelpful slack-jawed \"concierge.\" That world evaporated and ceased to exist before I even entered the EPIC. In the unbelievable alternate universe of this hotel, there are only highly competent, sharp, gracious, helpful caretakers who have a passion for both hospitality and for Miami that translates into an incomparable guest experience. Never before have I had glowing, friendly email correspondence with members of a hotel's staff BEFORE a stay, let alone AFTER, but that is the degree of excellence the EPIC inhabits. Bruno, B, Oscar, Rueben, Georgios, Brent, Christian...my new friends deserve all the credit for elevating their individual roles to the highest level and collectively accomplishing the impossible: my complete satisfaction. I left the Miami EPIC feeling like I had made a personal connection with the people and the place, due to their exceptional commitment, warmth, generosity and skill. Spectacular doesn't even begin to cover my experience, and that is before I even mention the facility, which is stunning and very well-cared for. My room was SPOTLESS, containing every amenity I needed. The cleaning staff was also timely, accommodating, smiling and very thorough. I knew that any request I had would be fulfilled cheerfully.

They gave us an entire bottle of sparking wine and a pitcher of fresh OJ. It was very nice. Unfortunately, the main pool area was being renovated while we were there (it is reopen now, don't worry), but we had use of the pools normally reserved for the condo tenants, which was just fine (I was concerned at first, but it really was nice). The attendants at the pool area are amazing. We will return for this service alone. They immediately greet you and arrange your chairs with a nice terry cloth cover and roll a towel to use as a pillow. Then they bring over ice water with orange slices, and they have complimentary sunscreen and anything else you may need. We ordered lunch from them to have at the pool, and that was great as well. Exactly what we wanted. We had a waterview room with 1 king, and it was very spacious and the bathroom is amazing. I loved being able to see the bed and the TV from the soaking tub. The shower is wonderful too. And it was incredible to have a computer in the room with free internet service. Amazing! Little touches were very appreiciated. We requested turn down service, and later I noticed that they also adjusted the lighting in the bathroom so when I went to turn on the light over the toilet in the middle of the night, it was set to half-bright (we had it on full earlier in the day, so I know they adjusted it) and this was perfect. One tip - if you become a fan of Kilimpton on facebook, look for the \"password\" each month. If you give it to them upon check in, you can get an upgrade if available, or else they give you other perks like free drink tickets, etc. Loved the complimentary happy hour each day from 5-6pm - free wine.

The bell service greeted us at the cab, called us by name and escorted us to the front desk, gave us drinks, and brought us to our room. Check-in took us less than 5 minutes and we were on our way. The room - wow - huge and the view was awesome! Free computer/internet service (which came in handy on many occasions).

The pool, one pool was under construction, but for the amount of guests using the pool it never felt crowded, the temperature of the pool was very nice!

It's not near the beach, but it does border the Miami River and Biscayne Bay. This hotel is the only one in Miami that offers a marina. Our experience My husband and I arrived at the Epic Hotel feeling tired and hungry. We had driven three hours from Key West in traffic and we were really ready for a rest. As we pulled into the hotel's driveway, a very responsive valet approached us and helped us take the bags out of our rented convertible. Then his assistant offered to take our bags for us while we checked in. The lobby was huge, cool, and very modernly styled. I noticed a table with complimentary iced tea and lemonade set up for weary travelers. A cheerful lady in a light blue taffeta suit/uniform checked us into a waterview room on the 25th floor. Since we had already paid for the room through Jetsetter, we just had to leave a credit card imprint for incidentals. The clerk also mentioned that the Epic offers great government rates to military and government employees. All we needed to do was flash ID and we could get that rate, even if we weren't on business. Handy information to have for next time! Once we had checked in, we headed for the elevator. Another staffer helpfully explained that the elevator will only go up with the use of a room key card. It's nice to know that the Epic takes security seriously, although I think that kind of a system is easily bypassed by a determined crook. The elevator went up a floor and two more hotel employees came onboard. They were executive types and very interested in our first impressions of their sleek new hotel. So far, so good. Our room We were very impressed by the huge size of our room, which I think was one of the hotel's basic models. Our room featured a king sized bed, a flat screen television, and two telephones, one on the desk and one by the nightstand. The room also had a computer, which had internet access and could be used free of charge. A large balcony overlooked the hotel's two pools, Miami's skyline, and the Miami River and Biscayne Bay. The view was very nice. We took the minibar key, though we did not partake of any of the booze. I used the room's computer briefly, though the connection was a bit slow. It ended up crashing, so we broke out our laptop. The bathroom Our bathroom in the Epic Hotel was very impressive. It was done in cool, white marble and featured a huge rainfall shower and a deep soaking tub. There were also his and hers sinks made by Villeroy and Boch and a water saving toilet that had a sliding door affording privacy. The bathroom had a large open window next to the bathtub that opened into the room. I think this is for guests who want to watch television while they bathe. There were shades next to the tub that could be pulled down for privacy. I didn't recongize the brand of toiletries that were offered at the Epic, though I did think they smelled nice. The restaurant We were really hungry when we arrived at the hotel. I was feeling especially cranky and didn't feel like venturing out to look for a local eatery. So we ate lunch at Area 31, one of the Epic's two restaurants. It was 2:30pm when we walked into the restaurant and the place was almost empty, although there was a couple ahead of us who had lunch reservations. A very pleasant waitress was working alone and seated us by a window so we could watch what was going on outside. Somehow, my husband ended up with a dinner menu instead of a lunch menu, so that caused some confusion. Then he wanted to order a bottle of wine. When it turned out the wine he wanted wasn't in stock, he chose another. Unfortunately, the second bottle of wine was also out of stock. My husband asked the waitress which wines they did have; she pointed out a white from Austria that she had seen in their wine storage. He ordered it and it turned out to be a very good choice. The waitress was very embarrassed and apologetic about the wine mishap and asked us what room we were in. She said she was going to send us an \"amenity\". For lunch, I had a club sandwich made with mahi mahi, bacon, spicy aioli, lettuce, and tomato and served with fries. The sandwich was tasty enough, but the fish made the toasted bread a bit soggy. My husband had a Cuban sandwich. Lunch was a little pricey, with my sandwich costing $16 and my husband's costing $14. But we were sort of a captive audience. I supposed we could have also tried the Epic's other restaurant, Zuma, which serves Japanese cuisine. Surprise! After lunch, we went back to our room for a rest and to catch up on the news. The Epic is not really located in an area that lends itself to wandering around. My husband went out to pick up some chocolate and red wine and ran into a few ladies of the night on his way. We decided to just stay in and relax. At about eight o'clock, there was a knock on the door. A young man had brought us a chilled bottle of Pouilly-Fuisse and a personal card with a note of apology from our waitress at the restaurant. Needless to say, we were feeling no pain by the end of the evening! The wine was very unexpected and a nice gesture... and totally unnecessary. We enjoyed it just the same! Room service We decided to get room service instead of going out for dinner. Area 31 provides room service. We noticed the menu prices were slightly higher and there was a 20% service charge as well as a $3 delivery fee. Nevertheless, the choices were fairly inviting. We ended up ordering hummus and chicken satay. The hummus was a red pepper variety served with pita bread and black olives. The satay was a little disappointing, with just three small skewers of grilled chicken on a bed of greens and a cucumber mint dressing. But we weren't that hungry anyway and the food tasted good, even if it wasn't very much for what we paid. Sleep We slept fairly well in the bed at the Epic, although I did get a bit warm in the middle of the night. The room has an adjustable thermostat, but it didn't seem to be very responsive. Breakfast We went back to Area 31 for breakfast and had the same very kind waitress taking care of us. She recognized us immediately and treated us like family, even seating us at the table we'd had at lunch. Our room rate didn't include breakfast, which was a pity, since breakfast was expensive. However, I do have to admit breakfast was excellent; in fact, I think it was the best meal we had at the Epic. I had Eggs Benedict, homefries, fresh squeezed orange juice, and coffee. My husband had scrambled eggs, bacon, cheese grits, toast, juice and coffee. Our feast cost about $60, with the most expensive item being the $6 glasses of orange juice. I will admit, however, that the orange juice tasted fresh squeezed and was delicious. Checking out Checkout was a breeze. Another cheerful lady at the front desk got us all set while the valets brought us our rental car. Valet parking, by the way, runs about $20 a day. While we were waiting for the car, I noticed that Epic staffers had put out a welcome sign for three dogs, complete with pet treats. All Kimpton hotels are pet friendly. The valets handed us bottles of water for the road to the airport. Overall impressions Our one night stay at the Epic Hotel wasn't quite perfect. Most of our troubles stemmed from eating at the restaurant. The food was a bit overpriced for what it was. It's also pretty sad when two bottles of wine are out of stock and the waitress doesn't even know about it. On the other hand, almost every Epic staff member we ran into bent over backwards to make sure we were happy. Everyone had a good attitude, a bright smile, and a friendly personality. My husband and I both thought the waitress's gesture of sending us a bottle of wine was very classy, especially since she also sent us a personalized card. The hotel's facilities are beautiful and immaculate. I didn't get a chance to try either of the pools because I wasn't feeling up to swimming, but the hotel does have a great pool area with lounge chairs, cabanas, and wait staff to bring out drinks and snacks. The hotel has a spa called Exhale that looked promising, as well as a fitness room that I didn't use. The Epic Hotel, like all Kimpton properties, also hosts a one hour wine tasting in the lobby. We tried this out when we stayed at the Hotel Alexis in Seattle, but didn't bother with it at the Epic because we weren't up to socializing. My recommendations I would definitely give the Epic Hotel another shot, particularly if we got another great deal on the room rate. It's a beautiful hotel and the staff is mostly fantastic. The Epic Hotel is definitely not an inexpensive place to stay and there are other Miami hotels that are closer to South Beach and the Miami club scene, but for our purposes, the Epic was just fine.", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Land O Lakes, FL", "Title": "\u201cLove this Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "NateKinFL", "ReviewID": "UR78645838", "Content": "My partner and I stayed two nights at Epic over Labor Day Weekend.

We used dock space for our boat and found the service by the dock staff top drawer and especially friendly. The hotel has a very sleek, contemporary Miami atmosphere.

Check in was a breeze and since we are Kimpton In-Touch members, enjoyed the little extras, like complimentary high-speed internet in the room, mini-bar gift and more. Fruit infused water is complimentary, pleasantly displayed and available throughout the day on the ground floor near the elevators. We were greeted at check in with a lovely offering of iced tea and lemonade. In the same location was complimentary coffee and tea in the AM. We found the brown sugar molded into seashells and starfish a nice touch. We had a double ocean room, complete with luxury bedding and a nice size balcony. The bathrooms are appointed nicely. There is a more than adequate deep soaking tub. The shower head was a rain shower style. Nice touch. Two separate above the counter sinks with plenty of counter space. The shampoos and conditioners were just okay. Not very much lather, and the shampoo was somewhat drying. the bed were comfortable. The room got a 4 not a 5 star in my rating for sleep quality only because I was restless and the sound outside from the cars passing over the bridge below was distracting. Many people might not even notice this. Light sleepers might. If you are a light sleeper, ask to be on the opposite side of the hotel from the bridge. We spent the day out by the pool. Nice breeze for a hot Miami day. The service by the pool was OUTSTANDING. Upon arrival, the pool staff set up a lovely cabana with luxury towels and served us cucumber infused ice water. Contemporary 'chill' style music played softly. The pool was cool, not hot, very refreshing. The clientele was a mixture of bikini clad singles, young couples, older couples with a few with babies. We were the only family with teens, but mine didn't seem to care. They enjoyed themselves. We ordered the hummus appetiser ($12) and a Cuban Panini (14) and split them for a pool side snack. Both were tasty, fresh and delivered on a service tray by the pool staff. Some were partaking in some fun tropical drinks. Light partying crowd. Nothing rowdy. Very relaxing. After showers to get set for a night out on the town, we also took part in the Complimentary Wine hour from 5 - 6 pm. Nice selection of Californian Chardonnay and Merlot as well as a specialty sangria. Staff was young, contemporary, young and attentive. We ate once in the restaurant on the 16th floor for breakfast. Very different. Atmosphere and service outstanding. Several of us had ordered the cheese grits to accompany our meal. They were very unusual, creamy not gritty. The apple chicken sausage was delicious with a light herbal flavor. Orange juice is plentifully served by a very attentive staff. Would HIGHLY recommend this property.

The room was nice and had a long wall of floor-to-ceiling windows. Everything about the enormous bathroom was incredible: perfect robes, great bathtub, nice shower. Their restaurant, Zuma, was excellent and the service was very attentive even though they were very busy (my boyfriend wasn't touching his drink and our server noticed and brought him a different drink to his liking). The service in all departments was great - they gave us a hotel credit because one day they had to test their emergency alarm system, which entailed extremely loud siren-like beeps intermittently for hours... but most guests were probably out of the hotel, and they had to do it by law. We were able to use the condo side's pools because they're doing construction on the hotel pools, and the 3 condo pools (in the same building, just as convenient) are gorgeous. We were even able to swim at night, which many hotels don't allow you to do. It's just a short 10-min cab ride to South Beach. The area around the Epic is a business area -- so there isn't a nightlife; most things close early-ish. But we did go to a Peruvian restaurant on the first night just a few blocks away, Ceviche, which is worth a try. I used the spa, and the service was extremely friendly and my masseuse was excellent.

We checked in an had to wait for Valet to see us, then we had to ask for a porter, then the receptionist was a bit confused as to the configuration of our rooms. He also attended us while finishing talking and laughing with another receptionist. Very unprofessional and unwelcoming. I called over a month ago to ensure we had 'connecting' rooms. They said the room doors could be open and we would share a hallway and be able to lock the main door. The problem: the doors are extremely heavy and don't stay open. The other problem: apparantly the unhelpful lady at the front desk 'sara' said there is only one doorstop in the entire hotel. I asked the housekeeping and 10 minutes later they came up with 2 doorstoppers. I asked the housekeeper about them and she said they had plenty. Clearly, someone somewhere is confused. Also, the porter had forgotten some packages from the car when we had asked for everything to be taken down. It would not have been a problem except he said that there was a wedding and everyone was confused. Too bad for hotel guests I guess. Housekeeping did not turn down the beds the first night. The rooms were big but the windows covered with prints and the couch was uncomfortably stiff and dirty. There was a half eaten cooke under it. Room service forgot some items even though I asked them to repeat it and I didn't realize until after I waited for the missing items they had forgotten salt and pepper. This has all been within 24 hours. Hopefully, day 2 will be better. Day 2 our keys don't work for the 4 th time and the receptionist claimed this time it would work and if it didn't we could just walk down again. I said excuse me but it's 10pm and if it doesn't work you can send someone with us to bring the keys to u for the 5th time. They didn't work, the person she sent with us took the keys and never came back. The next day I got the keys from a new receptionist who apologized and sent someone with us to check if they worked. It seems on the weekends the service drops drastically. Bottomline: this is a do it yourself place. What service there is which is minimal does not exist on the weekends. I figured out the managers must not be there during the weekends because the staff wa extremely young, unprofessional and clueless. If you want a place that gives you a large space with minimal comfort and service, epic hotel is your best bet. I chose this place due to their response to travelers critiques.

I found it here on Tripadvisor. I corresponded with the hotel to check & see if there would be work going on at the pool (earlier review mentioned it was loud) & to see if they had a pet free floor (they are a pet friendly hotel). I mentioned we were celebrating my husbands birthday & I got a prompt response saying that the pool would not be worked on during our stay, that we would be placed on their pet free floor AND we would be upgraded to a one bedroom suite. My husband was very surprised when we opened our door to our suite--and so was I. It was beautiful!! Floor to ceiling windows in the bedroom, with spectacular views of downtown Miami. Bed was VERY comfortable! An amazing bathroom & a very nice living room---with desk, computer & very comfortable workstation chair. (make sure to sign up for the Kimpton In Touch program on line---that gets you free internet use! Also, look up Kimpton on Facebook to see what their monthly secret word is---to get a free perk at check-in) We had also reserved a room on the \"club level\" which meant access to a room where there was a full time concierge, who was extremely helpful in helping us choose & dining options. There were 5 different food presentations set out daily. The breakfast was great! Extremely good quality---very fresh fruit! great croissants (I'm very picky!!) and bagels with all the trimmings, cereals, juice--fresh squeezed!, tea, coffee, etc. The items were pretty much the same all 3 mornings but that was perfectly fine with me---as it was all very good. There were tables available on the balcony & inside. We made it to 2 afternoon snacks--yogurt parfaits filled with cut fresh fruit & topped with granola & some very good cranberry bread. Also enjoyed stopping by on our way out to dinner for a drink (several choices of alcohol with mixers). Snacks laid out but we didn't try anything. Enjoyed stopping back by after our evening out for a sweet treat, too. One night Gene---the wonderful concierge even brought a plate of desserts to our room as he heard we had been by a few minutes earlier while he was away. Loved the pool and the very helpful attendants. They were able to set up our loungers so that I was totally in the shade, thanks to an umbrella set just right, and my husband was fully in the sun--as we requested. They were very attentive with glasses of iced lemon water. The spa came out to the pool in the afternoon & I had a 15 minute ($25) cabana massage. I was afraid it would be hard to relax at the pool---but it was great! Only wish I had signed up for an hour! Didn't eat at the hotels restaurant, but did stop by the bar with our free cocktail coupons---had a really good martini & enjoyed the experience. Negatives? Have to look very hard....shower is a rain shower---was ok, but I prefer a regular shower head. But it was a beautiful bathroom!

It was difficult to spend money we did not readily have on a vacation, but we were feeling burned out, so we decided to throw caution to the wind for a few days and try to enjoy the fun part of life that we felt we deserved. Through expedia, we booked 4 nights at a hotel in Coconut Grove, Miami, but after reading the reviews I quickly cancelled that reservation. I scoured the net and stumbled upon Epic Hotel. I read the great reviews about Epic hotel and even though we were going to spend more than we had budgeted for we decided to take our chances. Those reviewers were right! This hotel is the place to be! The hotel is just as beautiful as it looks on the internet, the suite we took was lovely, but what made this place so special for us was the staff! Every member of the Epic hotel staff was attentive and gracious and helpful and respectful and just simply wonderful! Thanks to Annie the valet parking manager and a really sweet person, who generously assisted us with our parking dilemma ($$$) and to Marcus who, upon our arrival, handed my son a bottle of bubbles to which he happily exclaimed \"cooooooool\"! My son also had another great surprise on the morning of our second day. You see, we had gone that morning to the restaurant to take advantage of our complimentary breakfast (offered to us the night of our arrival) and my son had asked for crayons and coloring paper when we were seated. The young lady who seated us kindly apologized to him for not having any and he was okay with that. After breakfast we returned to our room and were surprised to hear the doorbell ring about a half hour later. It was a special delivery for our son! A pack of crayons and a coloring book with stickers of trucks! (It is a pity that I have forgotten the name of the young man who delivered it, because every time he saw our son he asked if he was enjoying his book). We were all delighted and that made us fall completely head over heels with Epic hotel and the staff at that moment (and believe me, we had already fallen in love)! I could go on and on and on, because in our short 4 night stay, there were so many other thoughtful deeds done by the staff which made us feel competely relaxed and special and cared for, but I will stop here.

He offered us many options and choices for our booking and we \"settled\" for the Summer Playground Package in a Waterview One Bedroom Suite. Arrival - We were greeted at valet and were immediately surprised to find a special greeting for Goliath (our dog) at the hotel entry. We proceeded to check-in and used the \"Secret Password\" mentioned on the Facebook page for Kimpton Hotels. The helpful staff member took care of us and gave us our \"special\" surprise (You have to go to see what it is...and you will not be disappointed).

Room Service - All of our requests were granted by room service, and guest services....From the extra blankets and ice to the dog bed and dog food bowls - we had everything that we needed. Surprises - Alexi contacted me prior to our arrival to ask if we needed anything special....I sent her a picture of Goliath (when he was a puppy)- She made sure that his picture was in a frame and waiting for us on arrival. Nice touch! We were also surprised by a greeting from in-room dining with a special summer cocktail sent from Christian. Thanks Christian - The mojitos were outstanding!! Pool - Our large group headed down to the pool for a afternoon of \"sun\". We relaxed and enjoyed a lunch and cold drinks poolside while we tried to find some sun on the cloudy day. The water in the pool was comfortable and the lounge music playing in the background was a great touch to make the afternoon feel extra relaxing. The pool staff were outstanding and our server was as well. We had all that we needed! Fireworks - We enjoyed the South Beach fireworks from our balcony and were surprised to see that the Bayside fireworks were also right there (slightly blocked from the adjacent buildings) - but visible in the reflections on the building's windows. The location was perfect and it met our needs and main reason for the trip. Area 31- We enjoyed a continental breakfast at Area 31 the next morning which was a perfect way to start the day...good pastries, fruit, bagels and coffee!

We stayed with our original room because of the beautiful water view. The rooms were as pictured, everyone knows your name, and no request was too much for them. While I was out and about, I ended up calling in to the hotel several times for directions and phone numbers, and was provided prompt, friendly service. We also asked for a microwave, and a fridge to be brought up, and were accomodated for no additional charges. I think what I really liked the most about Epic is that they did not nickle and dime you for every little thing. They charged a price up front that encompasses everything that you might ask for (within reason) and I appreciate that. I would prefer to pay a little more on the front end, then to have unexpected charges on the back end. And Epic came in a little over in price than a few other hotels, but under in price then some that should have been considered better, but I could tell that Epic's amenities were superior ( and they were). For people who need to stay before a cruise, Epic is about 5 minutes from the Port of Miami, so this is an excellent place to stay before and after.

The view from the 16th floor pool is gorgeous.... beautiful pool lounges and 5pm wine by the pool is just the perfect extra special touch. It's a shame that one of the 2 pools is having a bit of a problem with some of it's tiles coming loose....but these are construction woes and I am sure they will get them fixed....I don't feel it detracted from the pool experience. I also read some prior reviews about food by the pool poor and service slow but our experience was nothing but good....service poolside was WAY above and beyond and food was very good. I did have a bit of an issue with my AC in the room not wanting to turn back on after shutting the sliding glass balcony door....but service was up in the room within minutes of calling to fix the problem. I also had a slight issue with my internet connection...but once again service fixed it within minutes of calling....seriously...I don't think I had to wait more than 5 minutes before they were knocking at the door....that's what I call good service;) You are with-in walking distance to many top restaurants....Capital Grille is right across the bridge.... Chophouse is right down the street....walk over to Bayside and South Beach is only a 10 minute taxi ride....cost was $15 going and right around $18 returning from South Beach.

During this longer stay I would have seen the good and the bad as it is hard to please anyone every single day for that long a stay , particularly someone as picky as I am. I always stay at 5 star hotels including Waldorf Astoria hotels, and Ritz London and Paris,Sherry Netherland ,Peabody Hotels etc In Miami i have stayed at the Viceroy, Ganesvoort and Mondrian all very nice but not the service level of Epic I stayed on the club level and enjoyed the continental breakfast when i wanted it along with sandwiches at lunchtime and snacks in the afternoon, tapas and cocktails in the evening and desserts before bed , well worth the extra charge I was lucky to get to know their wonderful concierge staf and cannot say enough good things about them including Sonja,Gene,Reuben ,Bruno and wonderful\"B\" whose cosmos I looked forward to whenever he was working evenings . Every request was greeted with a can do attitude and the hotel should be proud to have such a high caliber of staff although from what i was told when asking how they had such a great staff it appears Epic has a lengthy interview process which shows. The rooms were lovely and serene with comfortable beds, beautiful bathrooms with soaking tubs or bubble jacuzzi tubs in suites.(I stayed in both) I enjoyed both the city and ocean views as i live normally on a vacation island with ocean views. Maids did a great job too , rooms are very clean.I really loved privacy button, no maid ever banging on door at 9 am to wake you up when you wanted to sleep. The large 2 pool area on hotel side is beautiful with views and cabanas. The plasma TVs in the cabanas were the way to watch the World Cup . Staff is great Zach started my stay off with frozen grapes by the pool and i later saw him working all over the hotel Cecil my wonderful pool concierge greeted me every day and made me look forward to each day as did Daniel and Troy and the other pool staff i saw every day The mojitos are addictive, however they also make a mean pina colada The wine hour is a fun way to meet fellow guests and residents from condo side of hotel. As a side note my stay was not really for fun as my husband was in Miami for surgery and was the reason i had to keep extending my stay. However this caring staff made me feel at home even during difficult times and made me smile with cheerful surprises of giant cookies for my birthday and when my husband was able to join me after being released from the hospital, strawberries and champagne to welcome him and wish him well Spa is very nice ,check out hammann and quiet relaxation room.

There's another restaurant on the 16th floor and another bar on the ground floor, both of which seemed rather nice. The only downside to our stay was our disappointment with our decision to upgrade to the club level rooms. The room itself was very nice (although all Kimpton rooms are nice), but we were sold on the \"club lounge\" which was supposed to offer alcohol throughout the day and five snacks, for lack of a better term. The bar was usually understocked and the food wasn't all that impressive. Nitpicking, I suppose, but we definitely won't make that upgrade in the future.

Just me and her, no kids or childish venues to be thought of, seen or navigated. The Epic hotel was a perfect fit for these expectations. Per my wife, \"The time spent away felt like when we were dating without kids to consider.\" My with and I live in Broward County, which is 30 minutes from Miami. So, i won't mention the airports, shuttle service, etc. However, I can tell you about our arrival greeting to our subsequent departure. Though, if we could afforded it we probably wouldn't leave. On to the review. . . We booked the hotel one week in advance and still obtained a decent rate. I called in advance and confirm that no conventions we scheduled there, which is important if you want some peace, relaxation and no hustle and bustle. Our dates chosen were perfect. Upon check-in we were received by Albert, my Domenican brother from another mother. He took total care of us. Reuben was great too. Up to our room we went but we were put in a room without a view. However, with two rings to the front desk we were moved to room 2701. What an awesome view and space! My wife and I were blown away. Little things we noticed, toilet door lock was loose and door bell face plate fell off. Even so, the ammenities were great. I know I sound picky but this is a review right? At 6pm they have a wine and cheese event on the 16th floor. We enjoyed some fabulous wine and returned to our room to clean up for dinner. The bathroom accomodations are awesome. Just an fyi. . . the shower and tub are great for two adults. . . We did not eat at Area 51 or (31) something like that. Instead we went to EOS, located in the ViceRoy hotel (8 minutes away). We walked there which was cool because it felt like you were in New York. There are alot of restaurants in the area so transportation is not necessary and yes we did feel safe walking around in the area at night. EOS was great. Totally awesome food, portion sizes and food quality. The menu prices are appropriate for the venue and ambience. We would definitely go back. Walking back was a little chillie, so carry a scarf or shaul for the wife. The next day we decided to stay an extra couple of nights. Yes, we liked it that much.

A nice touch were his and hers wash basin's. A lot of nice touches in the room, including a mini PC terminal that allowed us free interest access. The room included a balcony with a nice view of the bay. We tried the pool one day and it was quite nice and was heated. Service at the front desk was attentive and efficient. I would add the restaurant in the hotel, Area 31, was mindblowingly good. If you stay here you are missing something if you don't try this restaurant. They offer some nice outdoor dining. If there is a downside to the Epic is its not particularly well located in terms of walking to anything and is essentially in a business area. It is not difficult to get a cab out front.

The rooms are nice and spacious, the bathroom is great, lots channels on the the tv for our 15 year old daughter and free internet. The pool area is wonderful with sun loungers, beds, shaded areas and there is no one trying to make a fast buck by getting you a sun lounger by the pool, you walk out choose where you want to sit and the staff immediately come over with towels and iced water, not like the Loews! We were on the 29th floor and had the facilities of the hospitality lounge, which was ideal and Bonaldo is a really helpful guy. There are some quite expensive restaurants nearby, but take a short taxi ride or a 15 minute walk to the Brickell area and you will find reasonably priced restaurants there and the hotel will show you sample menus to help you decide.

The room was of a good size, the beds were comfortable and our room- city view, got some sun in the early evening, which made it lovely to sit on the balcony at that time. We enjoyed the hotel's facilities- especially the pool- all the staff were very helpful around the pool in setting up the towels and providing water. In fact it was quite breezy round the pool- it is on the 16th floor so they had a knack of making sure your towel did not blow away. Staff were able to make some great recommendations- Balans for breakfast down in Mary Brickell village and Miami Chophouse for bar snacks when we were jet lagged on the first evening. Other reviewers have commented on the location- we enjoyed being able to explore the whole of Miami, and not just SoBe. The only thing that let it down for me was how hard it was to get a good cup of tea! We knew from reviews that there were no facilities in rooms for making tea and coffee, but we also knew that there was tea and coffee available from the lobby in the mornings. On the first day, the only 'black' tea available was earl grey- my husband asked if there was any other tea and they brought out more of the same. On the second day he asked again- this time he was more specific and asked for 'breakfast tea' they went to look but apparently there was none in the whole hotel!! By the third day they had some- hooray! I don't fully function without my morning cuppa, so it was a relief! I find it hard to believe that there was no ordinary tea in the whole hotel- but maybe that is more common in a country full of coffee drinkers.

Negatives in our experience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1. As a security measure, the hotel requires use of the room key card to access the elevators. Annoyingly, our key cards never worked for our floor in any of the elevators. After punching the buttons for several other floors, we figured out that our room key cards worked for all other floors but ours. We started going to the floor above ours and walking down the stairs for one floor. The key cards worked fine for room access. Other guests on the elevator also tried to help us with their key cards but could not get access to our floor. On one occasion, one of the hotel employees was on our elevator and he also could not get access to our floor with his key card. He suggested we go to the front desk and get our cards reprogrammed, which we did not try. We figured the problem was not with our key cards since none of the other cards (including the employee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) worked either. Perhaps we could have got the problem fixed if we had talked to the front desk during our stay, but we did not try. 2. The hotel tries to be environmentally friendly with their towel/linen reuse policies. We did not realize that this meant we would not get new towels every day, even if we needed them. During our stay we hiked in the Everglades, used the gym and the Florida heat required frequent showers. In spite of our efforts to be conservative, we ended up using up the towels provided for the day (1 bath towel, 1 hand towel and 1 washcloth per person) and put them down on the floor for new towels. However our towel replacements got progressively fewer over the 3 days of our stay. On the last of the 3 days, we only had 2 hand towels and 2 washcloths (no replacement bath towels). One of us used the spare bath towel (from the bathroom closet, which we didn't have to use in the first two days) and the other had to use a hand towel for a bath. Again, we did not complain and ask the front desk for more towels. 3. We did not have any breakfast options except for room service. There are no cafes or coffee-shops in or close to the hotel. Similarly, there is only one expensive dining option in the hotel (Area 31). While we were happy to have all our lunches and dinners outside the hotel, we missed having a quick breakfast corner or coffee-shop in or close to the hotel. The inconveniences we experienced were relatively minor in the big picture of the overall experience. We probably could have got the first two negatives fixed; however we were staying at the hotel for a leisurely vacation and were in no mood to complain. An important part of the experience of staying in a luxury hotel is not having to complain/ask for things to be fixed.

The room itself was stunning - very modern. Loved the complimentary internet. Beds are comfy and the room is well appointed. We loved the cool towel that is offered to you on arrival, but weren't sure what do do with it once it had served its purpose. Check-in was fine, but the card key we were given didn't work in the door, so the bellman had to let us in with his pass key and go get us new keys. Lunch by the pool was lovely, albeit pricey. $48 for a pitcher of mojitos. Overall this hotel is not for the budget conscious. Service was spotty. Check in was good (except for the card key glitch). Service by the pool was good too. Drinks in the restaurant were good but the service was slow and the server forgot 3 of the 6 drinks we ordered.

We didn't realize that we'd be so far from any beach when we booked--if you look at the Epic's website, it deceptively shows pictures of beaches and the South Beach area, when in fact the Epic is a $25 cab ride from South Beach or any of Miami's other nice neighborhoods (Coconut Grove, Coral Gables). The Epic is in downtown Miami, and there's not a lot to do nearby. There is the Bayside Marketplace, but this is pretty much a tourist trap with limited shopping (national chain stores mixed with junky souvenir shops) and food options, and pricy bus or boat tours. One of my main disappointments with the Epic's concierge and front desk staff is that they seemed to have limited knowledge of the options available in the Downtown area. For instance, we asked one evening about good, reasonably priced restaurants in the area for dinner. The concierge told us that \"pretty much everything closes at 6pm downtown\", except for fast food, expensive restaurants and the Marketplace. However, we ventured onto the mainly deserted streets one night and found a half dozen nice, inviting, reasonably priced places in the area (Ecco Pizzateca is an example). Why isn't the concierge desk on top of this? Granted, this hotel may cater mostly to rich business travellers with expense accounts who don't think twice about dropping $500/meal, but the concierge should be prepared to assist a spectrum of guests with different requests. On another occasion, I called the concierge desk but got no answer, so I called the front desk. I asked the agent who answered if she could suggest any gay nightlife spots on a weeknight. She giggled and stammered that \"I don't have any idea about that\" and she said she'd have a concierge call us back. After a couple of hours, we didn't receive a personal call from the concierge; instead a list was slipped under our door. This was effective (if tardy), but it lacked the personal touch of the expected phone call. Another example of a lack of sensitivity when dealing with gay/lesbian customers came upon our check-in. We were informed by the front desk agent that we'd been offered a water view upgrade, but she then said there must be a mistake because there was only one king bed in the room. Rather than telling us the room description and allowing us to correct her if this wasn't what she wanted, she assumed that it was a \"mistake\". Generally, the staff was friendly without being aggressive; they were there to help if you needed them. However, we had some problems with botched room service orders, including missing items. We were also a bit peeved to find out that a large gratuity was already added to the room service charge; although the people who delivered the food tried to resist taking a tip, they still took it when we insisted, and without mentioning that the tip was included. For us, the treat/splurge of our vacation was staying in a five-star hotel, so we were trying to spend within reason in other areas. If you rent a car, the Epic will charge you $35/day to park, and for us this was out of the question. If you want to see a lot of different parts of Miami, the Gray Line tour bus is a decent option; tickets can be purchased at Bayside Marketplace for $20/day. If you are only interested in going back and forth to South Beach, you can catch a $2 public transit bus, the S or the C--it's fast, convenient and reasonably safe. A word about Area 31: the food was only so-so and the portions were tiny. But the worst part of our dining experience was when our server lied to us and told us only the prix fixe menu was available because it was Valentine's Day. Having just gotten to the hotel from the airport, we weren't interested in a four-course menu with wines at $155/person. When we pointed out to this server that an a la carte menu was delivered to our table that said \"Happy Valentine's Day\", our server reluctantly admitted that a limited a la carte menu was available, but she said \"these aren't our best dishes\". When we decided to share an appetizer and order two main courses and no drinks, she became brusk and unfriendly. Only later when we ordered desserts and a bottle of wine did she decide to be attentive and friendly again. If we wanted crappy, NYC-style service with attitude, we could've stayed home. All our other experiences with waitstaff at other Miami restaurants were satisfactory to fantastic--our only bad experience was at Area 31. I feel as if I've concentrated only on the negatives, so let me address some positives. The views of the bay are beautiful, and they afford you a view of the Epic's pools below. The pools are every bit as beautiful as they appear on the Epic's website. If the weather had been warmer, I'm sure I would've spent lots of time poolside. The gym is small, but has top-notch equipment in a pleasant setting. Our room was very spacious,although the decor was fairly bland/safe modern. The beds and the bed linens are heavenly and luxurious. The room service breakfast, while overpriced, is absolutely delicious. The complimentary wine hour is a wonderful, unique touch. The housekeeping staff did a great job with turn-down service; even though we spent a lot of time in the room, we were never disturbed and upon our return, the room was always perfectly tidy.", "Date": "March 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "missdai", "ReviewID": "UR57128272", "Content": "I would stay again if the price is affordable.

The food quality is good but not great, and the restaurant service is relatively inattentive and unskilled, especially in comparison to the superb manner in which the Epic is otherwise managed. The property is a short walk from the Bayside specialty retail area and many other downtown attractions, as well as a short taxi ride to almost everywhere else; so the disappointing food service can be avoided. The mattress was softer than I prefer or expected, but it was not such a problem that I complained or lost sleep. The exercise room offers a variety and reasonable quantity of cardio and weight training equipment, but it felt crowded in the AM. The two pools are beautiful with exceptional service and skyline views; and even though I am a beach lover, they are more comfortable than a beach.

My husband and I stayed at the Epic for a conference in February and came to Miami earlier that weekend to spend some quality time together before heading back to the cold Northeast. We stayed at The Setai on Miami Beach a few nights before but then moved to the Epic on Sunday afternoon for the conference--making the difference between the two hotels all the more stark--and the Epic turned into a disappointment. We arrived late in the afternoon on Sunday as a few other conference attendees were checking in and pulled up in a traditional Miami Yellow Cab (no need for a car in SoBe). When we got there, the bellhops simply stared at the car pulling into the carpark, looking bored with their lot in life and not making any gesture to come and help us. After struggling with our bags, one bellman finally came over to stand lackadaisically by as my husband pulled our bags from the trunk. He didn't even offer to take the coat or backpack that I had slung over my shoulder. He grunted at us to go into the lobby and followed us in. Later in the trip (after getting bumped from my flight home), I returned to the hotel from the airport and had the exact same experience--the driver had to help me get my stuff out of the car--the bellmen (numerous at this point) stood around looking lost. We checked in with the girl at the front desk who, after telling us that there were no rooms with a single bed left, continued the \"bored with my life\" vibe and waved us away towards the elevators and up to our room. The room was small and standard with a computer and television and two double beds. To make matters worse, we landed in a handicapped room--with no real way out since the front desk woman was SOOO helpful earlier (at least at this point). We were right off the elevator bay (which mind you, dings all the time, though you couldn't hear it through the door when you were in the room). After getting settled we went and checked out the 16th floor reception (wine for free) as well as the hotel amenities including their restaurant, the new Exhale Spa that just opened, and the pool area. The restaurant seemed to be a pretty typical hotel restaurant--and we glanced at the menu but decided to pass on dinner that night (we were pretty tired and the food didn't look all that appetizing.) Later in the trip we had lunch at Area 31\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich was ok-typical hotel restaurant fare and prices. I had the Mahi sandwich and substituted the fries for a salad which they were happy to do. The pool area seemed fairly neat but the weather was cold and rainy so there wasn't any opportunity to use it. The pool is raised and there are cabanas around the edges that look like they could be pretty nice, though I am not sure why you would stay here when you could hop across the bridge and get a place on the beach for the same cost. I wanted to check with Exhale to see if they would honor my NY membership (which having traveled to many places that have Exhale outside of NYC, I know they do) but the guy behind the desk had no idea and told me that I would have to pay to take one of the Core classes. I was too tired to argue so I decided to just leave it. My husband and I then returned to our room to relax and I decided to go an track down some ice, only to find that the ice machine on our floor didn't work. I called the front desk to let them know that the ice maker was broken, but didn't get a call back to let me know that it was fixed and the woman on the line didn't even offer to have some ice brought up Since your key gets you to your floor but not others, you can't exactly use it to go to another floor to rustle up some ice so I basically resorted to stalking another guest to another floor with a working ice maker. When I got back I noticed a message light on the phone--and my husband went to retrieve it--only to find that there was some mix up with which room we were actually in and we couldn't actually get the message because according to the computer we were in one room, when in reality we were in another. This wouldn't have been such an issue if we hadn't decided to get room service later that night. (Side note--room service was good--food was pretty decent and sizable). The guy delivering our food ended up standing outside the wrong room knocking for about 10 minutes before the front desk called us to let us know that our room service was ready (but that it was being delivered down the hall). We got it straightened out eventually but it was kind of a disaster. Finally, my husband printed out a boarding pass from the in-room computer--and it simply never showed up--no one brought it up to slide it under our door, and no one called to let us know it had been printed. I wonder if you ever had something really important printed, if it would actually make it to your door. On our second night we were finally moved to a room across the hall (same dinging elevator all night long) but MUCH nicer. This had a bay view and a much larger bathroom and king size bed. If we had been in that room originally my impression of the hotel would have been slightly better. The balcony overlooked the Intercoastal heading out towards the bay and there was a pass through between the bathroom tub and the bedroom which was a neat design element. Again I made an ice run, but was foiled by the same broken ice maker. This time however, I ran into one of the hotel employees in the hallway who saw me standing with my broken (the handle was broken) ice bucket by the elevator. She told me to stay in my room and that she would have someone bring ice up. She was very nice. A few minutes later she re-appeared with a cooler full of ice which she used to fill up my bucket. About 2 seconds later a second employee came with a full bucket of ice as well. The cleaning people and the service folks were great. One other nice thing\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe hairdryers that they provide are FANTASTIC. They are ceramic ion hairdryers that do a great, quick and quiet job on your hair without burning it like most hotel dryers do. We also had a lot of trouble with the air conditioners in the two rooms. Both rooms were stuffy and hot and you had to turn the AC down to 65 to get the room to cool down to about 70. Overall however, The Epic leaves you with the distinct impression that its kind of trying but its almost too much of an effort to make it that extra mile. I probably wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend this to someone looking for a good place in Miami as there are others that simply blow it out of the water.", "Date": "February 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cEPIC DISASTER.\u201d", "Author": "invest64", "ReviewID": "UR56719945", "Content": "Within a half mile of this overrated, and overpriced hotel, are such staples in luxury hospitality as the Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental, and Viceroy.

First off, upon arrival, there was an army of valet attendants and bellboys, all of whom seemed less than pleased that they were being paid to stand around and assist guests to the check -in counter, where two clueless girls behind the front desk couldn't offer suggestions to local restaurants. Additionally, they were getting argumentative with a family whose room keys were not working. Room Service arrived forty-five minutes after ordering. It was cold and the order wasn't accurate. I called to have it picked up, because I refused to pay for it.

After a long flight from Europe it was very nice to step into the relaxed atmosphere of the lobby.

Happy for this we went checking out the room; it had a large flatscreen tv, great views over both water and skyline. We also got a jacuzzi, minibar, stationary computer, free wireless internet and the best bed i've ever slept in. The parents 'only' got a regular room which also was great, and with a even better view than ours. Besides from the great rooms, the pool deck at the 16th floor is pretty amazing both pool and view-wize. This is also where the complimentary wine hour between 5 and 6 p.m. was located during our stay.

We had dinner at the Area 31 restaurant one night, and it was allright, even though I expected a little more. Same for breakfast, totally OK food, but not much more than that.

He led you to believe (maybe good acting) that he really was happy to be there and happy to serve you and make your trip fun.

He made our experience so much nicer than we ever expected it to be. The others (Bruno and Vanessa (?)) were super nice too; she put us on the club lists around town for the night scene. It was fun to see all of the swanky bars she suggested. Thank you! We also had fun with the fun table in the club. It's like a giant iPad computer table (photo below). We played checkers, music, looked at the maps you could pull up. I want one! The room overlooking the ocean and pools was perfect. Great city views, pool view, and nice view of the $150 million yacht too. The beds were comfy, the bathroom shower was so nice, and the interior design was sleek and relaxing. The pools and pool service was swanky too. The furniture was super comfy and made the atmosphere even better. Then, the pool service. Towels on chairs w/pillows provided without even asking. Water being served w/out asking. Then, being offered Ebooks, Wii, suntan lotion, and all other sides was so nice. I didn't take advantage of all, but it was nice to know that if I really wanted to lay there all day, I had people there to make it happen so I wouldn't have to be interrupted by needs. Even the bathroom by the pool was super clean and didn't represent the standard creepy pool bathrooms that we all try to avoid. In short, the service, swanky appearance, hospitality, pools, awesome room... and everything else had me beefing up my retirement savings after this trip.

Exceptional staff - From the front desk staff to the waitstaff at the restaurant, everyone was very professional, neatly dressed and interested in how our stay was and if anything could be done to make it more comfortable. - A+ 2. Cleanliness - The staff did a great job preparing our room, and also did a very thorough cleaning especially on Thursday, we could practically eat off the floors - A+ 3. Room Quality - Tops all around from layout to quality of linens and toiletries. - A+ 4. Convenience - Very convenient to get to places downtown and a short hop away from Miami Beach minus the congestion over there, close and direct to the airport. - A+ Now the negatives: 1. Construction - I was awakened every workday to what sounded like an angle grinder being used above our room. This is not the nicest noise to wake up to and got annoying as the stay progressed. I was surprised this fact was not mentioned when the room was being booked as I did so directly through Kimpton. No mention of this was made upon check in, or by anyone at the front desk. When ordering room service I asked the waiter if there was construction in the hotel (since I wasn't fully convinced that I was correctly interpreting the noise I was hearing) and he replied that there was. On checkout I mentioned the construction issue, which was met with a shoulder shrug and a nothing we can do about it comment, which I can understand, but I would have preferred to know this ahead of time at booking. So, for lack of disclosure - F 2. Room service - No problem with staff or promptness, but food quality and value is severely lacking. The only time I got sick was on a turkey wrap that arrived warm, my hunger got the better of me and I paid for it. Insane prices on food, literally halving prices would bring it in line with reality. - C 3. Smells in Hallway - It smelled like Fido lost it in the hallway and it soaked into the carpet before the urine could be extracted. If you are going to be a pet friendly facility rip up the carpet and seal and polish the concrete in the pet rooms. - D 4. Minor Nitpicking - Certain services in the hotel were still being constructed so unavailable, I was not there for pleasure and there is plenty to do otherwise I would have been upset over not having access to all the services stated on the hotel site. We were shooed out of the pool area early (very nicely) so an adjacent area could be setup for a wedding reception, which wasn't too big a deal for me, but did upset the wife a little and rightly so if you come from a cold and cloudy city and want to soak up some rays. - C Overall, an above average experience, but just enough wrong to make me look at alternatives when traveling to Miami.

An example is me having asked for the aioli on the side and the guy bringing it when I had about 2 bites left on the sandwich.

One other gripe I have, and I probably took away a star for this alone, is that the bartender made us one of the worst mojitos I had ever had. A $15 mojito in a 4 star hotel in Miami, FL should have an awesome mojito. This certainly wasn't the case. Anyway, the hotel itself is awesome.

The gym was equipped with the latest machines and what seemed to be a pilates or aerobics room complete with mats and an iPod docking station. The view from our room was simply stunning, the only complaint there, is the few hours the construction crew was sounding drills on another building (EPIC staff previously appologized for this).

So, we were continually thrilled with the friendliness and service we received throughout the hotel: the car attendants, front desk, general and housekeeping staff and particularly the restaurant. By the way, the breakfast is nice, lunch delicious and dinner at Area 31 wonderful. Some of the best prepared fish I have had in years. Look for the private dining rooms overlooking the Miami River. Also, the River Bar in the lobby is right on the water and a hot place on weekend nights. The rooms are stylish, well thought out and fairly large. Computers and flat screen TVs in each room and free internet access was available. The only thing you may not care for is the glassless, open window space between the bedroom and bathroom. While there is a heavy Roman shade to roll-down, noise from the bathroom for a sleeping guest may be off-putting to some. Still, the views of the bay are nice, the pool, a beautiful edgeless place in the sun overlooking the bay, and good rates can be had for those who look and plan ahead.

In fact, the gentleman comped our breakfast and even threw in extras to make up for the confusion. PROS: Views are breathtaking. Service is top notch. Rooms are very clean and the beds/pillows are sooo comfortable. Pet Friendly. Room service food = very good. Very nice showers! Water is left in room every night. Turn down service. CONS: Location leaves a bit to be desired. No hot tub(huge disappointment for such a nice place and pool). No coke machine or anywhere to get a drink in the hotel. They tell you to walk to CVS(2 blocks). Summary. If you are in town for a cruise, I can't think of anywhere better to stay. Just keep in mind it's a $20 cab ride to south beach.

But my coworker was given a tip to switch our reservations to the Epic hotel a couple days before we left. When I found out that it was a Kimpton hotel I was extremely excited having stayed at one back home (Washington, D.C.). When we first pulled up there was some construction dust that had us a little nervous, but after the valet and doorman came up to our vehicle we were so giddy. They had the cutest/fashionable/sexy little outfits ever! With matching Fedoras!!! I don't think I will ever forget that. They were so nice and friendly. The front desk staff checked us in and informed us of the nightly events such as ice cream and popsicles in lobby. When we went into our room we were immediately blown away. A beautiful sliding glass door led to the grand bathroom with the largest tub I've seen in a regular hotel suit. I would have jumped right in if I wasnt stunned frozen by the huge window cutout thingy that allowed you to see into the bedroom from the tub/pool in the bathroom. Oh, did I forget to mention the twin bowl sinks and rainforest-esque glass encased shower?!?! My bad... So now the room. The bed was great, but I was still gawking at the beautiful bathroom. There was a huge flat screen t.v. on the wall and below it sat...wait for it...your own personal computer!!!!! What the #$*@&?!?! Amazing! I am in love. I would have sat at that computer all day if it wasnt for the beautiful balcony with sweeping views of the water and the two infinity pools below us. The pools were great. The service was even better. They bring you water with citrus fruits cut up in the glasses. Fresh towels. Wonderful seating. Perfect water temperature. I can go on and on and on... Trendy nightlife can be found in the lobby. I think you have to be beautiful in order to enter...or maybe the ambiance of the hotel just makes everyone look beautiful anyway?!? The only semi negative thing I can possibly say is that menu at the restuarant menu tends to run on the exotic side.

We booked a city-view room through the Kimpton rewards program. Upon arrival they gave us a complimentary $10 for the Mini-bar, they upgraded us to a partial view of water-view at no charge, and allowed us to check-in well before 3PM. Our reservation also came with a complimentary beverage or a continental breakfast for each of us, each day. We did have to ask about this, but I think it was only because we were in such a hurry to get into our room upon check in. Breakfast can include eggs, toast, and hashbrowns which is great and so are the drink coupons since they are $13 a pop. We ate at Area 31 once and it was good, but a little pricey. I think you can find other places to eat downtown that are just as good, but won't have the view or the price. If you are spoiled from american fast food like us there is a quiznos, subway, and pizza hut within walking distance. There is also a CVS, a liquor store, and a number of different banks within walking distance, but there is an ATM on the 14th floor for you to use. Rooms are great and conviently come with a computer inside with free internet. Bathrooms come with huge bathtub and seperate walkin shower. View outside is breathtatking! Parking is a little expensive, but it is like that everywhere in Miami. If you are looking to go back and forth to South Beach you will need a car. The drive is not far at all, but in cabs that could add up. The bar on the lobby level seemed to be happening Fri-Sun, but we never checked it out (wish we would have). Pool is the best thing at this hotel. Views are amazing and pool service is great they will set up your chairs with towels, bring your ice water with oranges, they have suntan lotion if you need it, reading materials, cabanas are huge, they bring you fresh fruit, and they keep the drinks coming. The complimentary wine hour is worth the stay at the pool and it is a great touch for the hotel. I never saw any children on our 5 day stay, but the hotel does welcome dogs which I found to be so adorable they even put out welcome signs for them with doggie treats. Too cute!

It even has a window looking into the bedroom area. I enjoyed the flat screen desk top computer with free wi-fi (very convenient!), the flat screen tv, and the ever so comfortable beds! The pool area is very nice with awesome views of downtown and the waterway. They have several pool areas to hang out at which is very pleasant as it wasn't crowded at all. When we went to hang out at the pool one day, the workers were always so attentive and so kind to refill our water glasses whenever they noticed it was half full! We also needed some information about renting a car and ended up talking to the conceirge at Epic. Not only was he very helpful and informative, but he also gave us some great tips on where to go and hang out around the dowtown Miami area as well as South Beach. Very helpful! If you plan to be out on the night on the town, the hotel is isn't too centralized. However, they do have River Lounge, a nice classy lounge bar to hang out at for drinks and to mingle as well as Area 31 at the hotel. If you plan to go out somewhere in South Beach, it is about a 15 minute drive and would cost about $25 for taxi ride. . Our last night we decided to rest and stay in. We ordered room service and I was again impressed with how prompt they are. Although the food was very delicious, it was a bit pricey. One plate cost us about $40.

This is a great hotel for a short break with a great pool area. I highly recommend it. If they read this - here are a few very minor suggestions for the hotel management...... - The pool has several tiles missing on the external walls - these are quite sharp and could be nasty for a child. - You advertise kiddie packs for children....we didn't get any and doesn't look like a reviewer below did either - no biggie, but if you promote it in the room, literature and online - you need to offer it. - You need some new glasswear/plastic wine glasses for the evening reception.

The weather wasn't so great, but the hotel was so enjoyable that we didn't mind hanging out there for the evening. I would recommend Kimpton's hotels to anyone interested in something different than the regular hotel chains. Do yourself a favor, and join their InTouch club. They run specials all the time, and it's a great benefit. Also, I noticed when I was reading reviews on here for the hotel restaurant Area 31, there were some that made me a little hesitant to give it a shot. Well, my husband and I dined there our first night, and it was awesome. The service was exceptional, and the food was diverse and delicious. I can see how anyone that is very picky about their food might not enjoy it, but if you're like me and willing to try anything, I would highly recommend it.

I had high expectations going into it, and the experience I had exceeded my expectations. My boyfriend and I stayed here after we got off a week-long cruise. We had to leave the boat early in the morning and decided we'd go on ahead to the hotel with all our luggage around 9:00 am, and we weren't sure if we would be able to check-in yet since check-in wasn't until later afternoon (3:00 I think...). Anyways, we were very welcomed when we arrived extremely early and we were given our room key immediately! This was SO nice since we were so exhausted. The room was very modern and had a great view and a huge balcony; it was very clean, there was free computer & internet access right there, a plasma screen TV, and the bed was very comfortable. It was wonderful. (I did miss the animal towels we were used to seeing from the room stewards on the cruise...) My experience at the pool was also amazing. When I asked if I could get a towel when I first arrived, the pool attendant took me over and set me up with a great view of both the pool and the water with a towel to lay on and one for a pillow. He then brought me complimentary wine from the evening reception in the hotel, and came to check on me often. However, I did not have any cash to tip him - I didn't realize I would be pampered at the pool - so I feel stingy and really regret this. (I believe his name was Roberto, and if any management reads this, please send him my gratitude and note that you have an outstanding employee who would be fabulous with many more customer service responsibilities than just working at the pool! He made my experience at the Epic that much better.) We decided to try the Area 31 restaurant for dinner, but when we got there we were disappointingly turned away because there were so many reservations (it was a Saturday night). The hostess told us to try back in 45 minutes, and we did so without any complaints. We were understanding of the situation. When we returned, we were immediately recognized by the supervisor who was very apologetic and set us up with complimentary champagne and sat us right away. The food we had for dinner was spectacular! It is pricey, but well worth it. Overall, I highly recommend staying at this hotel in Miami. The icing on the cake is that it is a pet-friendly hotel, yet it is so elegant seeming that you would never suspect a dog or cat has ever set foot inside. I did not have my dog with me on this trip, but knowing she could stay here if needed was a bonus.

Due to the outstanding experience we had, we would like to take the time to comment on our stay. From a mere factual point of view, the EPIC in itself is already a wonderful place, with sleek and modern rooms, great views of the Miami harbour and Miami Beach in the distance. You could continue with praise for all of the tangibles but that would not reflect nor describe what you really experience here as the characteristics are those of any top-end hotel around the world and reproducable by others. What really makes this hotel stand out among its peers in the area and around the globe are its people. Upon entering the hotel, you can sense a calm and relaxed type of team spirit, which also has a calm and restoring effect on the guests. Out of all the nice people we met at the hotel, we would like to point out some of them who made our stay really special. Arriving from another hotel in Miami Beach, we called up the hotel to arrange a transfer to the EPIC in advance and spoke to the Club Level concierge, who turned out to become our main point of contact in the hotel and club lounge. He won us over with his professionalism, effectiveness and attention to detail. You could feel that he was doing at all times much more than his job to make our stay with you as unforgettable as it was. With good recommendations and an impeccable drive, he arranged and checked several tours for us, all of which we turned down in the end as we did not want to leave the relaxing atmosphere of the hotel anymore. But this positive experience is not only limited to one single person but also applies to all other staff we met. They managed to overcome the distance between employee and guest that is experienced most of the time when travelling. Due to the amount of travelling we do and the focus on many other things, it is rare for us to remember specific names. But be it the young and friendly staff at Club level or the helpful colleagues by the pool, they all turned from face- and nameless employees into real personalities and people we will remember and tell others about. They did so due to their presence, commitment and dedication and by living all the good values advertised on the in-room leaflets. As a small note for improvement regarding our stay, we would note our experience with the Sunday brunch at Area 31. Despite the nice setting, jazz music and some quite good food, the disappointing part was to find the same pastries as at the club lounge the day before on the brunch buffet and then again during the afternoon/ evening the leftovers from brunch re-appeared at the club.

The hotel is new with nice decor and was very clean both inside and out including nice new carpets in the hallways and rooms which is a big plus. We had a relatively spacious room that had a large balcony with a very nice view of the Miami River and the drawbridge across Brickell Street. While I wish the television would have been a bit larger, more importantly for me the room was quite and we could not hear the occupants in any adjoining rooms or passersby in the hallways, which for me, will ruin any hotel stay. The rooms also had a great bathroom that had a sliding door to seperate the area for the toilet from the rest of the bathroom, which is great if you are not traveling alone.

For a start, its location isn't great: it's in the downtown area, so there isn't much around. And while the pools are nice, they don't catch the sunshine for most of the afternoon. In the room, the shower was poor: weak pressure, and the water never got properly hot. The bathtub was uncomfortably squarish, so not conducive to relaxing in. But the worst part is the restaurant, Area 31, which is a big pity considering it's pleasant location. The food itself is insipid. The huevos rancheros for breakfast lacked taste, as did the eggs benedict, and the smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel. The service was patchy and often offhand.

The hotel still seems relatively new and we actually had to almost pinch ourselves when we walked in the lobby. This place looks like it's for celebrities. The pool area is something you'd see on TV - ultra modern, private outdoor areas with lounges, bars and televisions behind a curtain. The rooms are very spacious and well-appointed, complete with a balcony overlooking the bay and a personal desktop computer at the desk. The bathroom had his and her sinks, a soaking tub and a separate shower - and is at least double the size of most hotel bathrooms. The staff was more than happy to accommodate us, even giving us a 3pm checkout when we requested it. They were shooting a music video in the lobby on the day of our checkout, which should tell you how glamorous this place is. The breakfast included in the rate was at their Area 31 restaurant and just included juice, coffee/tea and assorted pastries... so we decided to order an omelet as well to have a more balanced meal. The croissants were amazing, but breakfast could have been better overall. Also, parking is $32 a night which we thought was high, but you definitely need a car to go to Miami Beach, see the sites and go to restaurants. Right now, this area is pretty deserted (which might explain the deal we got), but it looks like there will be a Whole Foods, movie theatre, shops and restaurants just across the street.

It may get busier once it has been open longer. However, the bar seems to get very busy on Friday and Saturday nights with a dressy crowd, presumably of locals. The rooms facing the water have mixed water and city views, but in fact the city views are quite interesting.

The prior reviews do not accurately reflect my visit to the Epic Hotel. First, DO NOT expect a five star hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c DO NOT expect a four star hotel. The Epic Hotel is a solid three star hotel that is located in the middle of a massive construction area. There is construction of a new Marriott Hotel next to the Epic Hotel, and there is an office building being constructed behind it. Construction noise permeates the premises from 7 AM through 6 PM. DON\u00e2\u20ac\u2122T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE CONCIERGE FLOOR I stayed on the Concierge Floor. Again, DO NOT expect the same \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concierge service\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that exists on the Concierge Floor of a Ritz Carlton Hotel. No, this is ghetto concierge. Let me give you some examples -- In the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concierge lounge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to Epic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website and in-room brochures, there are supposed to be light snacks and drinks served throughout the day. You are even given a schedule of particular offerings in the concierge lounge. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continental breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the concierge lounge was standard fare \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bagels, cream cheese, lox, a few pastries, fruit and yogurt. Very much like what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d find at a Best Western\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continental breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There was also a lunch snack \u00e2\u20ac\u201c turkey sandwich finger food. There are wine and cocktails put out from 6 PM \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 8 PM. The one that intrigued me was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sweet Dreams\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from 9PM \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 11PM. I asked the concierge, Gene, what \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sweet Dreams\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he answered that there were lots of dessert treats and after dinner cordials for guests to enjoy. Here is a list of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sweet Treats\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that I saw when I went to the Sweet Treats on 4/15 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c No after dinner cordials (there were nine bottles of hard liquor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c vodka, gin, scotch, etc. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that had been out all day.) There were two bottles of white wine that had similarly been out all day. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sweets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were two bags of Doritos Tortilla Chips that had been opened and put on plates, six mini cookies on two plates (lined up three to a plate), pretzels on separate plates, and two mini-dark chocolate Milky Way Bars. That was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sweet Treat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on April 15. Simple answer, if you are going to stay at this hotel, do not waste your money on the Concierge Floor (almost triple the price of a standard room in the hotel). ROOMS In my estimation, there were about 60-75 guests in the hotel when I stayed there. Clearly, the hotel was pretty empty (since there are 411 guest rooms). The room that I stayed in had two double beds and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153water view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The view was actually of Biscayne Boulevard (US Route 1), but if you look through two buildings that are under construction, you can see a part of Biscayne Bay. There was a draw bridge on ground level (twenty nine stories below my room), but you could hear the warning bells ringing every time the draw bridge went up or down (approximately every \u00c2\u00bd hour). There was no dresser in the room. The only drawers to store clothing or personal belongings are in a night table between the two beds. The bathroom was very nice, but it is still a question to me why there is an open window and a curtain shade between the bathroom and the bedroom instead of a solid wall. There was a huge balcony overlooking Biscayne Boulevard that was approximately 6 feet wide and 15 feet long. Surprisingly, for a balcony that big, there is no lounge chair \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are two chairs and a square table that take up about 3 feet of the balcony. Without any substantial furniture on the balcony, it is very desolate to stand out there and stare at the road below. During my stay, as with many of my hotel stays, I placed the loose change that I accumulate in a glass that I place near the telephone. After my first day, there was probably three to five dollars of loose change in the glass. The glass and the change were gone after the first time the maid cleaned the room. Buyer beware. Also, be careful of the staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cleaning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on my first night in this high end room, my foot was stabbed by a toe nail that was left in the carpet by a prior guest. AREA 31 DINING By far and away, the Dining Services offered at the Epic Hotel were the most disappointing. There is one restaurant named Area 31. The restaurant has an incredibly limited menu. Moreover, the bar in the restaurant has a very slim selection of cocktails. (During my stay, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thomas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a member of the restaurant staff told me that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153he does not want to air the Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dirty Laundry, but there was a party over the weekend that used up most of the Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquor and the Hotel could not yet restock.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Why couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the hotel restock after nearly a week?) Now, I ordered several drinks that are common, but not that common to be used up by a single party \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Brandy Alexander (hotel had no more brandy), anisette (hotel out of that), sambuka (hotel out of that), cr\u00c3\u00a8me de menthe (either clear or green)(hotel out of that). When ordering, I was immediately told that the hotel was out of escargot \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not a big deal for me since I do not care for escargot. No other changes were noted on the menu. There were five fish dishes on the restaurant menu. I ordered Mahi Mahi at the suggestion of my waitress. About a half hour later, the Sous-Chef, Steven, came out of the kitchen and told me that there was no Mahi Mahi left. (By the way, I was the first person who came in for dinner at 6:05 PM. The restaurant opened at 6 PM for dinner. When did they run out of Mahi Mahi since I was the first guest for dinner?) I ended up having a grilled swordfish dinner that was dry and difficult to eat. In recognition of the immense screw ups by the restaurant staff, the Maitre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d did not charge me for this dinner, but invited me back the next night when he was sure that all of the problems would be resolved. I went back the next night to try the only restaurant one more time. This time, I did not order any drinks from the bar, and stuck with water and iced tea. I ordered only what was recommended by the waitress after confirming that there was an ample supply of the selected food. There were no less than five staff people (some of whom I did not recognize) who continually interrupted the meal to have discussions about the prior night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disaster and whether this night was any better. I ended up being more annoyed by the constant interruptions than anything else. I finished my entre, paid the bill, and left without any dessert. NOTE: The dessert menu is also extremely limited at Area 31 (four desserts in total). There are no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153traditional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd desserts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no cake of any kind, and no pie (except key lime pie). As a second note, if you order the chocolate moose, you may wish to make certain that you leave the whip cream topping off since it is grapefruit flavored, and sours the rest of the dessert. Finally, the charges for the food at this restaurant are not commensurate with other restaurant charges in the area. Dinner for a couple with a couple of glasses of wine/drinks will be approximately $200-$225. EATING AT THE POOL From 3 PM \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 5PM, the restaurant kitchen is closed, but you are supposedly able to get something to eat at one of the tables around the pool. (Now, this all comes from the same kitchen mind you.) I ordered a salad with a sliced chicken breast. My travelling companion ordered tuna salad. It took one hour and fifteen minutes for these two salads to arrive. After the extreme wait, I was expecting something extra-ordinary \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but, it was just a few field greens that you can get pre-packaged at any local food store, with oil and vinegar and a chicken breast cut up on top. By the way, I was not alone in the wait \u00e2\u20ac\u201c another person in the pool area arrived at the same time I did, and he had to wait the same time period for his salad to arrive. Due to the delay, the waitress ended up giving a complementary round of drinks to compensate for the delay in receiving food. STAFF Most of the reviews on this site talk about how wonderful the staff is. The staff constantly asked if there was anything that they could do to make your individual visit more special. While generally speaking, it is true that the staff is pleasant, they are extremely slow in responding. It is my belief that the staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pleasant behavior is used as a cover for the many short comings of this hotel. Financially, let me give you an idea about the cost of this hotel -- three nights at this hotel cost me $1500. There is no doubt in my mind that my money could have been better spent at any number of other hotels in Miami or nearby Fort Lauderdale. It does not make sense for me to endure the frustration of staying at the Epic Hotel again.", "Date": "April 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beverly hillsand las vegas", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value.

Really cool spot. I have paid several times more in town for much less. The room service menu is limited and they could use a few more TV channels, but other than that the place is perfect.

However, we did partake in the room service breakfast and my husband is still talking about the delicious bagel and lox he ordered. It came with like 8 huge pieces of lox! The food was delicious! The service was unbelievable- quick and incredibly friendly. They give you what you want before you even ask for it!! The service at the front desk when we arrived was superb and by the pool they were on top of everything without being in our face. And the infinity pools were refreshing and even heated. And the views!! WOW!! We had a balcony that overlooked the Biscayne Bay and it was unreal. We ate our breakfast out there every morning. And the goldfish in the room was a very cute and unique touch. We also loved that each room had a computer with free internet access.

The facilities are very nice, the views are great, etc. However I found the staff VERY poorly trained. It seemed that just by smiling and repeating my surname every second word, everything would be fine. Great service needs to be seamless and professional. Unnoticeable. It annoys me when people prettend to know me after 2 mins of hadnling my credit card, and be artificially nice. If I was going there every second week, I would expect the people at the reception to know me and treat me accordingly. But not having stayed there before, I just want professionalism. After already a few months open, there are many things staff does not know or is not trained for. An example of this was patent during breakfast. We had booked continental breakfast and were given coupons at check in to be presented at the restaurant. Apparently no one knew how things worked, since we were presented with an \"a la carte\" menu. We insisted that we just wanted the continental breakfast and our server mentioned that we could have anything a la carte for a value of $25. Nowhere could I find anything like that mentioned (neither in the coupon nor in the menu itself). Finally some manager came and explain that we could have continental breakfast. However when asked what items we could choose from she just said: \"coffe, juice, toasts and pastries\". She said it in a way implying that continental breakfast was the \"spartan option just to get along with people coming with coupons to her restaurant\". She did not offer the chance to choose what pastries we wanted to have, how many, etc. The breakfast at Fairfield Inn was definitely more varied. It was obvious to me that either they didn't know what to do (which I doubt) or they do not mention anything about continental breakfast in hope that people would just order a la carte and spend over $30 for breakfast. Worth to mention is that service was poor to average for us, but we noticed that the 3 tables closest to us had problems with their orders and seemed very unpleased (a family of 4 was looking very unhappy with the food/service, another table of two were sending dishes back for getting something they hadn't ordered, and some others were muttering about the sluggish service as well). To top is off, the night before we asked the concierge for a good seafood restaurant and she recommended Quinn's (in South Beach), which turned out to be a very bad choice indeed. Overall a nice hotel. I don't know if I would stay there again. I usually stay at Marriott owned hotels, I'm a gold member and no one tries to patronize me by repeating my name over and over. Appreciation is demonstrated by actions, not by words.

Andrew could not have been nicer and our interaction with EVERY single person on staff was incredible. Not a grumpy or \"short' one in the entire group. They called us by name and frequently inquired about our stay. The room was perfect with the most comfortable bed in the world. My husband's laptop's keyboard was malfunctioning so having a PC in the room was fabulous. We had a beautiful waterview and a lovely balcony where we sipped our champagne and watched the boats. The room was very trendy and chic with high end toiletries and great linens. The 5pm wine hour was delightful and my new favorite beverage is now Prosecco!! YUM! What a nice way to meet fellow guests and other members of the staff. After a day at the beach, we were too tired to go out and had a delicious room service experience. We had the Cuban Panini and the Mahi Mahi sandwhich with bacon and a spicy aoli. Even the fries were hot and tasty. We also attended the Sunday Brunch (it was Easter) and enjoyed it immensely .Of course, the all you could drink Mimosa, Bellini's and bloody Mary's could have had some thing to do with that! They also had a lovely jazz band playing on the balcony where we sat. The pool staff were also great and kept our water with fresh slices of fruit cool and tasty. It's nice that they have two different pools set at different temperatures. There are many nice restaurants close enough to walk to and we just hopped the C bus to go to South Beach.

My wife and I ordered room service each morning and ate on the balcony which was amazing. The highlight of this hotel is certainly the pool area. The 16th floor opens up to two large infinity pools (which were heated at different temps) and a ton of choices to relax in. There were cabanas, lounge chairs, couches, love seats, ect. We were at the hotel for 3 days and pretty much tried each spot once. There are pool attendants who are quick to refresh your towels and waitresses coming around often for drinks. The best part of being out there is the little extras that really made the trip for us. They brought us a complimentary fruit plate, came around with sun tan lotion and had fresh towels at your location before you even came out of the pool.

Without knowing it the front desk upgraded us to the club level - nice surprise that was unexpected. The club level is the 29th and 30th floor of the hotel with the club lounge located on the 29th. Hallways and rooms are beautifully decorated. Our room was furnished with king bed, inroom computer system, large balcony and great bath with double vanity, shower and separate tub.

I travel to Miami quite frequently and stay at alot of differenct hotels and never have I met a more professional consistently nice group of people. It truly was amazing! Whoever does the employee training at this hotel should be hired by their competitors for training. One downside - there is a problem with noise in the rooms coming from the hallway, adjoining room and the river bridge.
