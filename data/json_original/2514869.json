Location, you cannot beat the location of this hotel. Our first night in Paris, we were able to walk to the Eiffel Tower without any map or direction. That is how close this hotel is to the Eiffel Tower (10-15 minute walk). The hotel is located next to the Rue Cler where you are less than a 5 minute walk to the best chocolate shops, subway stations, bakery, cheese shops, restaurants (Chinese food, sushi, French food, pizza, Korean food, etc.), and supermarkets for basic needs. 2.) Value: Compared in price to other hotels, the rates are very reasonable. Great: Service, the entire staff works overtime to please the guests and make your stay in Paris as wonderful as possible. Especially Mo, I have never met anyone who treated guests as nice as he did and even got us tickets to the National Opera House (Opera Garnier)! Plus, Mo's knowledge of Paris is unbeatable.

However, I'd got a great price for their duplex suite which offered my son and me the ideal arrangement for sleeping. The room is split level; on one level was a single bed and on the upper level a full bathroom and a double bed. Perfect for our needs, we each had privacy and my son was within yelling distance! ... The hotel owners must congratulate their housekeeping staff as the level of cleanliness was very good indeed, and I had no issues in that regard whatsoever. The beds were firm but comfy with nice white linen. Lots of towels in the bathroom. There was a very new looking air conditioning unit in the rooms too, for those who need it. However, the decor (the wallpaper) was looking tired and was stained and curiously grubby in places and I was unable to open the window in my bedroom because if you did the curtain on one side started to slide off it's track and was held in place with duct tape. So these little things took the shine off it for me, especially when I was able to peek into other rooms (when the maid had the doors open when she was cleaning) to see some very nicely appointed rooms indeed. I suspect these rooms cost more but it is sad that their family room was not as fresh looking as it could be. Despite the decor issues I had, the hotel itself is in a wonderful location (lots of places very easily reached from here) and they also have a contact with a very reasonable and efficient shuttle service to and from the airport. The reception staff were all very nice and helpful and most of all I feel it's worth pointing out that this area is very 'safe' and easy to stay in with a family.

Value is very good, if you can get a good deal: we paid early booking rate of 119 euro per night, which (I think) is really cheap considering the level of the hotel, its location and especially other hotel prices in Paris. The room was spotless and nicely decorated, but the bed is very firm and it may affect your sleep quality. You can't call it a large room in any aspect, but it has more than enough room for you and your luggage, especially, if you, like us, prefer to be outside sightseeing (also there is plenty of hanging space and a free room safe).

The staff were all incredibly helpful and charming. Always greeted with a smile and always helpful with advice on what to do and see in Paris, and spoke near perfect English! Embarasingly much better than my French! Many reviews on Trip Advisor say that the rooms are small. Yes, they are, BUT this is nothing short of what I expected from such a lovely quaint boutique hotel in the centre of Paris. It was clean and tidy. There was ample space for our clothes and luggage, and also a safe in the wardrobe. Other people have commented on the firm beds. Personally, I love a firm matress but I can appreciate this isn't ideal for everyone. The bathroom was adequate. It was perfectly clean and tidy, but there are signs of wear. Particularly in the corners which are lightly stained due to condensation over the years. To be honest, I would say it could do with a re-tile and new bathroom suite in 1-2 years. However, just to re-iterate, perfectly servicable, clean and tidy! VERY MINOR NOTE: Breakfast was all freshly prepared and very tasty, but because the breakfast room is in the basement there is no view! Both myself and my girlfriend prefered to walk around the corner onto Rue Cler and have some breakfast in one of the many cafes there.

Staff: Mo (and Tina) at the front desk handled everything one would expect and more. They both went over and above at suggesting the 'good, fun things to see/do' and gave solid advice on what to save for the next trip (or .. gave us straight up advice on what to skip all together). We stayed 6 nights over the Christmas season and then spent 4 nights at a 5 star hotel on the 'Right Bank'. Mo and Tina did a better job at great service, making us feel welcome in their city than the 5 star we stayed in for the 2nd half of our 2011 / 2012 Paris experience. Location: On the corner of Rue Cler (a cobblestone street lined with small shops, great bistros, steps away from the easy to use Metro system) and Mott Picquet. We had scoped out all of the other boutique, quaint hotels in this area... location couldn't be better. 3 +/- blocks from Eiffel, walking distance > 1 mile to top rated 'must sees', Metro station right outside of the hotels' front door for sites that can't be 'walked' to. BTW - Metro is amazingly simple to use. Even the trip to Versaisse was fast as all get out!! The room: Small is relative. Ours had a double bed (two twins pushed together / just don't sleep in the middle :) ). Desk, chair, two nightstands, tv, small closet, bathroom was large enough for one at a time (well, okay ... maybe two, if one of us was in the shower and the other was brushing their teeth). Clean and tidy for sure!! We were fortunate enough to get one of the rooms that overlooked Rue Cler. Not sure why some travel authors say to NOT book a room overlooking Rue Cler due to noise. We heard no noise (even during the holiday revelrie going on) but DID have an awesome view of the spirited life of this quaint, market place street. Lobby: Two sitting areas - one for the weary travelor and another cozy area with complimentary champagne, sweets, computer and tons of traveling guides left by other visitors. Plenty large enough to do what needs to get done. Breakfast is offered in the floor below the lobby .. while we didn't partake (why would we when a ba-zillion bistros were calling our name on Rue Cler?) .. just remember, breakfast is available in the hotel.

Located less than 10 steps from the beginning of the Rue Cler and a 10 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower, I can't imagine a better place to base a trip to Paris. The area around the hotel is clean and safe. You can walk anywhere you want without anyone noticing you. The Rue Cler is a microcosm of Parisian life - outdoor cafes, bread & cheese shops, pastry shops, flower shops, etc...My wife and I spent every night sitting at one of the outdoor cafes, having a drink, and people watching. The Eiffel Tower and the Rive Seine are an easy 10 minute walk. Paris is best experienced walking around. My wife and I walked from the Hotel Motte Picquet to Notre Dame Cathedral, the Latin Quarter, and the Louvre. While the location is fantastic, what really made this hotel special for us was the level of personal service provided by Mo. I have traveled all over the world and have stayed in many of the top hotels. I have never experienced a hotel staff member who is as committed to making your stay perfect as Mo. On checking-in, Mo asked us if we had plans. We had some ideas, but nothing concrete. Mo pulled out a map, marked all the places to see, gave us a quick description, and told us when to go to avoid the crowds. Every day when we walked through reception, Mo asked if there was anything we needed. He enthusiastically answered every question, in perfect English, and never seemed bothered by any question. When we asked him for the best way to travel to Versailles, Mo told us to go to the RER C train, take the train to Versailles River Gauche, exit the station, and walk up the hill to the palace. He asked if we wanted to pre-purchase a ticket before we left to avoid the queue and beat the crowds. His exact instructions made the trip to Versailles as easy as could be. As far as the rooms, expect small rooms that are typical for a 3-star French hotel. The rooms are clean and have a very strong wireless signal. The wireless is free. Just make sure you let Mo know you need a code on arrival. I strongly suggest you use the Shuttle Service from the airport. The shuttle cost 36 euros and is arranged by the hotel.

We found English TV channels to catch up the the news, and free WiFi, which was a wonderful surprise bonus. (I agree with a previous reviewer that the carpets are overdue to replacement, but this was not a concern for us.) The location was very convenient, and Mo patiently explained how to use the transit system and which were the shortest and easiest routes to our daily destinations. We ate breakfast at a Rick Steves recommended PTT Bistro around the corner, and enjoyed dinner at a couple of patios on rue Cler - get there before 7 pm, or you won't get a table!", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMade very welcome, if we go back to Paris we WILL be staying here\u201d", "Author": "kleaneasy", "ReviewID": "UR117842043", "Content": "Travelling on a family holiday with my two children age 17 & 11 we stayed here for 5 nights. We chose the hotel for its location, family room size and excellent customer reviews and we were not disappointed. We noted in our booking that we don\u2019t speak French; this was not a problem, on arrival we were met by the very friendly Mo who speaks excellent English, the necessary paperwork sorted very quickly we were promptly shown our room so we could settle. I booked the family room sleeping 3 people (one double & one single bed) on two levels, the landing area gives a spacious feel and the distance between the 2 rooms and bathroom provides unexpected privacy. I slept downstairs; the children shared the upstairs double bed. Because of the space and layout we were each able to watch TV on a night or use the bathroom without disturbing anyone sleeping. The room was cleaned and bathroom freshly stocked every day. The beds!! \u2013 What can I say; I suffer with serious back problems easily compounded by a poor quality bed. The bed was perfect!!!I slept very well and woke relaxed and refreshed, that\u2019s not easy with my physical problems. There is a small fridge in the room with a small selection of drinks and quite reasonably priced for a hotel mini bar, although we had no cause to use it thanks to them leaving enough space for our own drinks bought at the local mini market around the corner. In booking we wanted somewhere within reasonable walking distance of the sites and we were not let down. There is a metro station almost on the hotel doorstep, and the Eiffel Tower only a short walk, other sites are easy to get to on foot if you\u2019re happy to walk, public transport easily accessed due to location and the hotel staff always happy to help you arrange taxis etc or provide details of the public transport, routes and costs. The adjoining street is full of cafes and bars providing a wide range of food from traditional French to Chinese and more. Prices vary but you can eat, and eat very well at low cost if you\u2019re on a budget as we were, on our first night we found a wonderful little traditional French caf\u00e9 (two streets away, no more than a few minutes\u2019 walk) a set menu gave us a 3 course meal including half carafe of wine or one soft drink per meal, for the 3 of us the bill came to less than 40 Euros. The hotel reception area has free internet access which the children used daily during our visit; we were also welcomed home each day to a freshly made cup of coffee/ hot chocolate. There was only one tiny issue during our stay, on returning to the hotel one night we met a member of night staff we had not seen before, when asked if we could have a hot drink we were told no, this was not available. He wasn\u2019t rude but was not chatty and in comparison to the rest of the team who were all very helpful, chatty and friendly this was unexpected and disappointing. However when we came down the following morning Mo was already aware of the confusion from the staff member and very apologetic, seemingly the man was not a regular member of staff only providing cover, by way of apology we were given a free breakfast for the following morning. When we returned later that night to the same man he was much more welcoming and while we didn\u2019t want a drink (we had just been to the ice cream parlour) he did offer one. It is worth noting the breakfast room is very small, however the choice of breakfast in the many local cafes is unlimited and competitively priced hence the hotel only provide a small area. To say the staff at the hotel are wonderful would be an understatement. They all speak excellent English, and cannot do enough to help. They\u2019re always on hand to provide information on the many sites, and where they don\u2019t have it will look it up online for you. They will assist with advance bookings for any tourist sites (a must for the Eiffel Tower to avoid queues), a service we took advantage of for several activities. In short \u2013 the room was great, the service was great, the location great, the staff great, the only problem was that we had to come home and if we\u2019re ever back in Paris I will be staying here!!", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely little find\u201d", "Author": "Daniellesite", "ReviewID": "UR117762066", "Content": "The service was fantastic.

The carpet was filthy and the matress had almost no padding--you were basically laying on a bed of springs. There was one exceptional staff member, Mo. Unfortunately he was only working on the first day of our stay. His counterpart was a nasty woman who was rude and vindictive. The night before our departure we asked how to get transportation to the train station and how early should we depart for a 10 am train. She told us 8:45 would be plenty of time. However, in the morning she told us we would never get a taxi before 10 am and insisted numerous times that we had given her the wrong information about our departure. She was not only rude, but downright nasty. We did finally get a taxi and caught our train.

Based on the reviews I read decided to go with this one. So,,,here is my review: First of all the location is great. Walking distance from all the major sites. We walked most of the time but there is also a Metro staion 2min walking from the hotel. Bottom line - locatrion is great ! When I got to the hotel I was given the \"famous\" room 301. The room is so small (by any standard) and for me it was not usable. Maybe if all you have is a single trolly you might be OK but we had two suitcases and there is no way to be in that room in this case. I did not have a chance to check the bathroom (except of a quick look). Went back to the reception and the guy called Moe and replaced our room to 206. This was a great room. Although we were told that it was the same size as 301 this is not the case. The bathroom is much bigger (the bath itself is larger), we had plenty of space for two BIG suitcases !!! This room had also the problem with the water pouring on the floor when taking a shower (the rubber seal of the glass door does not reach the bath.....). I hope it will be fixed but its not a big deal (except for the stuff that needs to clean the swimming pool every day :) ) The biggest issue I had was with the Internet connection. This was very important for us since we use Skype to call home. Internet was a BIG issue. Using one laptop and two Iphones we could not get a connection most of the time. If we got a connection of 5 min it was a big success (and usually after 20-30 min of trying to connect. I am traveling arround the world in my business and have never seen such a poor internet connection. I told that to Moe after the first night but nothing was improved during the other 3 nights. If the internet connection is important for you - consider taking another hotel or at least try to verify that the problem was fixed. Again, I can only talk about my experience with 3 devices and maybe other guests did not experience the problems.... Last comment - we did not book the hotel online but by e-mail. At first, the rate I was given was 140 although the web site had a rate of 129. Only when I pointed that out I got the low price. So, if you are booking by e-mail/phone - check the prices online first !

It is true. Moe and Tina are a delight in every sense of the word. Their desire for their guests to experience a wonderful time in Paris and in the hotel is genuine and sincere. They are a gold mine of information about Paris and share their knowledge with great enthusiasm. They are also very kind people. When my husband came down with a cold, part way through our stay, Moe showed great concern and prepared a tray with tea and honey for him. He was on hand, New Year's Eve, to pour champagne for the guests, in the reception area, as they came and went. My only hope is that the owners of the hotel realize what gems they have in these two individuals. Secondly, the location is excellent. The hotel's proximity to major tourist attractions and public transportation is a real plus. Also the Rue Cler area is great for shopping for everything you could possibly need during your stay and the ambience is especially lovely at night when everything is lit up, and in the early morning, when the vendors are setting up shop. The next part of this review is difficult for me to write for two reasons. First, I so wanted to fall in love with this hotel based on the countless reviews I read before leaving for our holiday and based on the wonderful correspondence exchanged with Moe before we left. Secondly, I hesitated to write this review because I felt it would be a kind of betrayal of these two people, Moe and Tina, for the good intentions they showed during our stay. My decision to write a lengthy and complete review resulted, finally, from the conclusion I came to regarding the deficiencies in this hotel, which I believe rest more with the owners than with the management. Much has been written about the quaint and charming nature of this hotel. I like 3 star hotels in Europe for that very reason. They can have a shabby chic quality about them. I'm sorry to say that the chic was missing, in this case. Upon receiving our key to Room 301, a room in the back of the hotel and the only one with a partial view of the Eiffel Tower, we were dismayed with the condition of the room. We immediately reported that the bathroom sink was cracked, the hairdryer in the bathroom also cracked and the towels, threadbare and torn. This information was passed on the owner and Moe, according to Tina. The ripped towel was not replaced and when we asked for additional towels, another ripped towel found its way into our room. This is unacceptable. When I passed this information on to Moe he explained that they had a towel service and would let them know. My solution would be to get a new towel service or check all the towels before placing them in rooms. He told us that he ordered a new sink for the room to be installed at a later date. He replaced the hair dryer a few days later. My concern with these three situations is that as a guest I should not have to report damage in a room which we are paying 200 euros to stay in each night. Housekeeping should be reporting any damage in the room and certainly the condition of the linens/towels and this should be remedied by the owners. If a room is damaged, we as guests should be informed about it, not the other way around. A somewhat negative review was posted about our room shortly before our trip and Moe responded to the person's complaint. It had to do with a leaky bathtub. We had selected this room, not for the tower view, but for the bathtub which we knew we would appreciate after the previous week long river cruise where we would have access only to a shower. A movable partial glass swinging door allowed water to flow freely on the floor each time the shower was used and Moe explained that this door was essential to the design to allow larger people to get in and out of the tub. It was a terrible design and we spent our five nights mopping up water off the floor, as a result. The solution would cost a bit of money and would involve the intallation of a shower curtain and the removal of the troublesome swinging glass door. The guests also complained about the very small configuration of the room requiring that they store their luggage in the bathtub. Ultimately, they were moved to a similar sized room but one with more space in the bed area and less space in the bathroom. We sent an email to Moe, after reading the review, and he offered to move us to a larger room which was considerably more expensive. We declined. The hotel had been renovated recently and I think this is where the owners need to step up to the plate. A former poster referred to the furniture looking as though it had been purchased at a garage sale. When I read the review I thought the sentiment was pretty harsh but both my husband and I agreed that having seen his particular room, it was dead on accurate. It was furnished with very flimsy end tables and the most ridiculous desk I have ever seen in or out of a hotel! This desk and a hard wooden chair were ugly, impractical and a huge waste of space. We were not surprised by the very small rooms. We were prepared for that. What we weren't prepared for was the poor use of space. In renovating these rooms a wiser and more expensive option would have been to build a wardrobe and recessed shelves for storage - a more expensive custom build which could have retained the old-world look of the room and would have been far more functional. We stored our luggage in the luggage room and this alleviated the problem, somewhat, but the final verdict would have to be that in all of my travels, this room was the most depressing space I have ever encountered. It may be that there are far nicer rooms in this hotel but I would not wish Room 301 on my worst enemy. Photographs of the room were not intentionally misleading. Just like you can't capture the majesty of the Grand Canyon on film, so too can't you capture the misery of this awful space in a photograph. Trust me. Paris was a city that far exceeded my expectations. Unfortunately, Hotel Motte Picquet did not. Please note. It was not a matter of the size of the room. It was the condition of the room and the design of the room combined with the price we paid for the room. Another guest wrote in an older post that he felt that travellers could do far better in this district of Paris and I am inclined to agree. The owners have a winning combination with their desk clerks during the day but they would be advised to pump a bit of money into the decor and maintenance of their establishment before a savy brand of tourist comes to the conclusion, as we did, that enough is enough. For this reason, I could not recommend this hotel to members of Trip Advisor or any of my friends and family and it grieves me to write that. I know that Tina and Moe are very conscientious in reading and responding to reviews on this site and I sincerely hope that they understand that none of my comments were written with any malice or unkindness. I meant to ask Moe a question before I left but he was not working on our departure day. Either the government of France or the municipality of Paris assigns a star rating to their hotels. What is the current star rating of Hotel Motte Picquet? A previous poster said two stars but I was under the impression it was three stars.

We were there when there was some wild weather and found ourselves walking back with snow swirling around us; and when we arrived back at the hotel, wet, sniffly and bedrangled, Mo said ..\" well you're home now.\" He did show us what bus to catch if it should happen again! but we persisted in walking as much as possible to take in the sights. We wanted to walk as much as possible to see the sights - the Eiffel Tower, Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, the Louvre - discovering the neighbourhood. The Rue Cler just round the corner is incredible and when we didn't dine out with our friends we bought the most delicious deli items from here as you could avail yourself of plates etc from the kitchen in the hotel.

My teenagers were very happy with their room, as were we in the duplex with our youngest. The rooms are pretty, quiet and clean. We all had the breakfast in the hotel each day as it was very convenient for us. We left the hotel for the airport when Europe was in chaos with all the snow, with our flight eventually cancelled. I needed to ring our next accommodation from the airport, but couldn't get through on the number given, in desperation I rang Mo, he was so helpful, and he quickly realised I needed to ring the international access code and gave that to me.

The little lobby looks like it came out of an elegant Lilliputian manor, and the breakfast room is lovely too. The breakfast is full and tasty, with eggs cooked to order, for 12 Euros. Only one big worry - in our room, the shower stall is at least a foot off the ground and is very difficult to get into and out of safely, and we're quite mobile. We suggested that they install a step or a hand-rail or both, right away. The problem is, your back foot slips in the shower as you step down with your front foot onto the floor.

It\u2019s a very small hotel and that may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea but it was perfect for us. The d\u00e9cor in the public areas is beautiful, typically French with a modern twist. In Reception there is a small seating area, were travel guides and fiction can be borrowed. There is also a laptop available to use free of charge anytime you wish although all rooms have free wi-fi anyway. Downstairs there is a breakfast area. Breakfast is an additional 12 euros per person per day and it\u2019s a continental buffet I believe. We never took breakfast at the hotel but down on Rue Cler where there is an array of great caf\u00e9\u2019s. Our room had been recently decorated (as has all the bedrooms I believe) and was really nice. Its on the small side but as is the norm in Paris and we didn\u2019t have much of a view (of a air vent and three walls) but at the end of the day its only a place to rest your head after a busy day sightseeing and it was definitely quiet! If a view is important to you however ask for one facing onto Rue Cler to see the bustle of street life. The bed was comfy, perfect pillows and clean crisp sheets. The bathroom is a tiny bit dated and could probably do with a bit of a facelift to match the bedroom but it was very clean and it was great to have a bath to soak our weary bones after a day walking about in the city! The only minor issue we had during our stay was our air conditioning didn\u2019t work one night and was on the blink for another. Not much of a problem really, we were just unfortunate for us that it was beautiful weather while we were there so we had a couple of uncomfortably hot nights! However the staff were most concerned by the situation and tried to fix it as speedily as possible. The receptionists Mo and Tina are amazingly helpful with advice on nearby restaurants, getting about on the metro and sightseeing etc. Mo even booked for us advance tickets for the Eiffel tower so we could completely avoid the lengthy queue! It gave our stay a really personal touch another advantage of a small hotel. The hotel is less than 100 yards from the nearest metro \u00c9cole Militaire which is situated in easy reach of pretty much anywhere in the city. The metro system is simple to use (similar to the London underground) and reasonable priced. The hotel is really well situated. Less that 10 minute walk from the Eifel Tower. Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Invalides and Jardin du Luxembourg and Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es are all in fairly easy walking distance as well. Rue Cler is a street that runs along the hotel gives you a real slice of Parisian life. In the day stalls selling fruit, veg, cheese and bread line the street. In the evening the caf\u00e9s and bars come to life. Try the ice cream shop near the hotel, gorgeous ice creams and the caf\u00e9 about half way down the street on the right on the corner with a black and red shop front . I\u2019ve forgotten what it\u2019s called, but the food is amazing and drinks reasonable for Paris.

Tina, on reception, recommended a restaurant in Rue Cler which is around the corner from the hotel and was a great value place to eat and full of atmosphere. There are boulangeries and supermarkets within a couple of minutes of the hotel. Tina and Mo took care of everything from restaurant recommendations, theatre bookings, best metro routes, internet access problems and transport back to the airport.

We stayed at this hotel at the beginning of October for 5 nights. Had originally booked for 4, but we decided to try for an extra night and was able to get this. We arrived at the hotel around 9am on a Sunday morning, so didn't expect the room to be ready. So we headed out to our first museum, and came back after lunch around 1pm and were able to go in then. The room itself was very pretty but very small. This was what we expected however, even though paying more for a deluxe room. We had a lovely view of the street with big windows in both the main room and the bathroom. Very happy with the comfyness of the bed. The biggest problem I had with the room was the shower. When I booked the room on their website you had the choice of a bath or shower. There was no mention that the bath was also a shower (I saw this when the cleaner left the door open to another room). So we picked the shower room. Well the shower was hideous. For starters you had to step up into it, not just a few centremetres, but well over a foot. And it didn't have any doors, it was just a shower curtain, so naturally the floor got all wet from the water. Was quite disappointing. On the other hand, the staff were supurb. We had a problem with our credit card not giving cash out at the ATM, so the owners helped us out with some cash. Very helpful. We didn't try breakfast at the hotel, just strolled up Rue Cler to the boulangerie for some croissants etc. Yum! The hotel is also really close to the Ecole Militaire metro and a 10 minute maximum walk to the Eiffel Tower. Overall I would recommend this hotel to friends/family and would definitely stay again.

Carrefour down the street in case you forgot something. - great staff in Tina & Mo - look at all the reviews - the hotel sells basically because of these two people and as they have only 18 rooms - the interaction is more personalised. They will try to help you to the maximum and that is saying a lot for Paris hotels. It definitely does not sell because of it's small rooms. - the rooms are clean but basic The only minus point is that we stayed in 205 and here you can hear the hinges of the metal hotel sign creaking all night - takes time to figure out from where the sound is coming.

Hotel Motte Picquet is in just the most perfect location. It is steps away from the Ecole Militaire Metro stop, a 10 minute stroll to Champs de Mars and the Eiffel Tower, and 15 minutes to Invalides and Rodin. Situated directly on the corner of Rue Cler, the fabulous little pedestrian street and market. Past reviews are spot on - The staff makes this place, and although I had minimal interaction with Mo, the times I did he was extremely polite and pleasant, and always took an interest in what we were going to do for the day. He made sure we had mapped directions to guide us to wherever we were going. Tina was fabulous, and she went out of her way to try to make dinner reservations for us at the last minute \u2013 almost missing her bus home that night. (Had I known she was ready to leave I never would have bothered her \u2013 but this just shows you the commitment the staff have at this hotel). She was marvelously friendly and both she and Mo spoke English just fine. I was embarrassed that I don\u2019t know much French. So you walk in and directly to your right is the lobby. A cozy little spot with a small couch, and then the reception desk. Off to the left of the \u2018front desk\u2019, are a sitting area with a few chairs and a small desk with a laptop for you to use (Free wifi throughout the hotel). The furnishings were gorgeous, and the place was immaculately clean. We arrived rather early, so Tina put our bags in \u2018storage\u2019, as we went out to explore Rue Cler for some lunch. When we came back, Tina had already had our luggage moved up to our room. Next to the elevator, there are the stairs. We were on the top floor. The hotel is so quaint and charming, and the rooms I imagine are all very similar. Our room had a view of the top of the Eiffel tower, and into a courtyard of other buildings out the window. You walk in and immediately in front is the bathroom, with a little folding door that accordions in and out. Nice size. Full tub/shower combo, sink and toilet. Storage is provided by a small little 4 shelved cart on wheels. Perfect. Hairdryer and electric shaver converter/outlet, mounted on the wall. Come back out of the bathroom and pretend you walk back in the front door again. Turn left and you open up into your bedroom. This is one room, with the bed, a small desk and chair, flat screen TV mounted on the wall in the corner, and 2 nice large bay-type windows, which we always kept open a crack at night for some fresh air. The bed is sandwiched between 2 floor to ceiling closet areas with some built-in nooks that serve as great little night stands. This was an ingenious use of space, as there was plenty of room for all of our things, and hiding in the closet on the left, was a mini-fridge. Perfect. We were on a 2 week Europe trip, so needless to say we had a lot of clothes, and large suitcases. We left them out on the floor against the wall. It was a tight fit, but no problem whatsoever. I really felt they made excellent use of the small space, with the built-ins that surround the bed. Tina even suggested that we empty all the stuff we needed and she would hold the luggage for us downstairs during our stay to give us more room. But totally wasn\u2019t necessary. We were completely and totally happy. Maid service was excellent each day, she did up the bed just right. Nice and extra tight sheets just like we like. Bed was comfortable, and there is no noise at all from the street to be concerned with. The room was always spotless. There is an A/C unit in the room, but we never used it. The breeze from the open windows was perfect. Sad to say we did not take advantage of the breakfast offered by the hotel. For 12 euro, you are welcome to a complete buffet style spread. We just had to venture out on our own and grab some crepes and coffee from the myriad of back street shops that you just can\u2019t help but wander down. There is no fault to be found here with Hotel Motte Picquet. It was the perfect accommodation, for our perfect trip to Paris.

I would in general not recommend using the Shuttle Service: - We had to wait for 30 minutes at the airport before they showed up. And the driver used his mobile for texting the whole trip (which lasted more than 1 hour due to heavy traffic) looking more at his phone than at the road. - They were 15 minutes late picking us up when we left the hotel.

The hotel is very well situated; close the the metro, adjacent to Rue Cler with its great selection of restaurants and within walking distance to most sights. The staff were, without exception, very friendly and helpful, and are a huge selling point of this hotel. We had a very pretty little (and I mean little) room overlooking Rue Cler, which was a bit noisy with the window open, but once it was shut the double glazing was very effective at keeping out noise. However, there were a few negative points. The mini-bar fridge and the kettle were situated in the bathroom, which I felt was very unhygenic (particularly as the fridge door, when open, was only inches away from the toilet seat.) It put me off making any drinks in the room, which was a shame. Our room was situated on the first floor, and the main drainage pipe appeared to be in the wall behing the bed. It was a bit noisy when people on the two floors above used the toilet/ shower etc, as it sounded like a waterfall behind our heads!! This was only really a problem on the first night (friday) when the people above arrived late and used their bathroom in the early hours of the morning. When getting ready to leave our hotel, I dropped an earring which rolled under the bed. I bent down to pick it up and came face-to-face with a Rent-a-kill mouse trap box hidden under the bed. I was glad I hadn't seen it earlier, or I may have had some sleepless nights!! Overall it was OK at the price we got it (133 euros a night) and we enjoyed our stay, however if we were to go back to Paris I would probably try out another hotel. NB: If you are staying here I would recommend wandering down to view the Eiffel Tower at 10pm when the light display starts. The area feels very safe and it really is a spectacular sight! Also, don't pay 12 euros for breakfast here - go to the little cafe over the road in Rue Cler and pay 6 euros for breakfast and sit at one of the outside tables watching the world go by!

From the minute I walked in ( very easy to reach by metro in fact if you aren't traveling with heavy baggage) I found the very gracious Tina waiting at the desk to welcome me and after completing check-in formalities, she showed me all the options available to see the city and the best ways of getting around. Since I was in Paris for a wedding she had already printed out a map of how to reach the city hall and the reception place, all within walking distance. Tina went above and beyond her call of duty however when on the evening of the wedding I had a slight wardrobe malfunction and could not zip up my dress! She suggested that I leave it in a way that would seem purposely made like that - I am forever grateful to Tina; no one noticed! My room was 105, a standard double on the first floor with AC and mini bar. I almost risked not staying at this hotel due to a credit card mix-up but through my friend who was getting married we managed to secure this last room available. I absolutely loved the location - a corner room that had two large windows, one overlooking avenue De La Motte Picquet and the other the delightful rue Cler, as did the bathroom window. In fact, another bonus to this room is that the bathroom also has a large window that opens up into rue Cler and is drenched in natural light .The room is small by some standards but for me as a solo traveler it was perfect.; it would be great for a couple as well. If you want to wake up in the morning and watch the locals go about their business this room offers the perfect view. On my last day I was tended to by Mo, as it was Tina's day off. Mo was very cordial and helpful in offering suggestions on my last day in Paris, and needless to say that there is still so much more see...giving me all the more reason to bring me back to this hotel the next time. As a guest you are not a number here; you feel so welcomed that you hate to leave. The neighborhood is also very safe; in fact, on my first day there I walked around on my own in the Champs De Mars/ Eiffel tower area until 10 at night, after the wedding reception a fellow guest and myself walked back from the D'Orsay museum to the hotel at 2 AM (about a 30 min walk) and never once felt in danger.

The internet was great, although the WIFI didn't work in our room, I was able to use by netbook in the lobby just fine. They were having problems which they were addressing while we were there.

Mo was very helpful and offered all types of advice from what to see and where to eat. The service offered by Mo was not matched at any of the other hotels we stayed at during our trip to France. Mo was even kind enough to arrange our shuttle from the airport and a taxi to the train station on our departure. We hope to return to Paris and we will most certainly stay at the Hotel De La Motte Picquet!", "Date": "March 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "United States", "Title": "\u201cA Perfect Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "KarenUSA", "ReviewID": "UR26502385", "Content": "While planning my honeymoon, I did extensive research here on Trip Advisor. I saw many hotels received mixed reviews -- at best. Based on what I read about these hotels, I was planning on whichever hotel I chose to have rude staff, receive no services, face possible double-booking and not having room for me, be charged extra for a room with a view, and dingy shabby rooms. And then I found the Hotel Motte Picquet's listing. It seemed as if this place couldn't receive a bad review if it tried! After emailing the hotel, I could see the reviews were accurate. I received super prompt replies and excellent service -- and this was just over email! Needless to say, when my new husband and I stepped foot into the hotel's lobby, we were greeted by Mo and his warm smile. Our first night there, he surprised us with a bucket of champagne, some glasses, and snacks! Throughout the week, between Mo and Sandra, the service John and I received was amazing. They helped us with everything! They called a taxi for us when we needed one, they booked a show at the Moulin Rouge (while at the MR, I spoke to one woman who said her hotel charged her a fee just to make the reservation for her!), they smiled as I butchered their beautiful French language -- thankfully, they speak perfect English! They supplied us with maps, suggestions as to what streets were good for dining, and which areas to avoid. While my husband was on the hotel's lobby computer (free internet!), and I was still feeling some jetlag, Mo was kind enough to fix me a cup of coffee. You're not going to find this nice gesture with one of the big hotel chains. By the time John and I left the Hotel Motte Picquet, we felt as if we had stayed with some friends at their home. Our room was beautiful. Americans: be warned that the rooms are smaller than what you're accustomed to here in the States. But I was already expecting this, so for me, it was no problem. Our room was nicely decorated, had a mini-fridge, a safe, a full-sized bathroom, and was at the back of the hotel, so it was nice and quiet. And the hotel's location is incredible. It's right on the corner of the Rue Cler, a pedestrain street filled with shops, markets, bakeries, bistros, and cafes. One walks up the Rue Cler for about two or three blocks, turn, and walk another two blocks or so, and there's the Champs de Mars and Eiffel Tower. The Invalides is just as close. There's a metro station just feet away from the Hotel Motte Picquet, and Paris' metro system is so very easy to navigate. This made sight-seeing a breeze. After a long day, John and I got off at our Ecole Militaire stop, and we were \"home.\" It had always been a fantasy of mine to go to Paris one day. And to go as part of my honeymoon, was amazing. Thanks to Mo and Sandra, and the rest of the staff at the Hotel Motte Picquet, this fantasy became a dream trip. I can't thank them enough for my wonderful time and memories. I urge anyone planning a trip to Paris to stay at this amazing hotel.

I looked for days on the web and every time I found a hotel that looked good, I came to this site, only to find horrible reviews. This was the only hotel without really any negative reviews - and that's because there really isn't anything negative to write about. This hotel is in a VERY idea location. The metro stop is only about a block away and a 10 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower. It is only another 10-15 minutes to the Champs Elyees. You can pretty much get anywhere in the city very easily from this hotel. The rooms are small (typical for Paris), but quite charming. The bed wasn't the most comfortable- but everything else was so wonderful, it didn't really matter. Mo and Sandra are overly helpful. I would recommend contacting them before buying metro passes (they can explain the different types of passes and recommend the best purchase) or booking any trips. We did the Seine river cruise (worth every penny) and the Champagne tour (not worth the $$$). We also recommend buying the Museum pass, unless you only go to 1 or so museums. Our favorite day was to Versailles and Sandra told us exacly how to get there and it was perfect! If you are looking for a cozy atmosphere, in a home like enivornment (Mo and Sandra treat you like family!) this is the place for you!! Thank you Mo and Sandra for a WONDERFUL honeymoon experience!!

The location and service gives you a true Parisian experience.

They are two of the nicest people you'll ever meet. Definitely take them up on restaurant recommendations, or have them book you a dinner cruise before you arrive. Paris is very expensive in general. Everything costs a little more. (Just like New York or San Francisco.) For the money and during the summer, Hotel Motte Picquet was a really great value! You won't find a comparable hotel for less.

Our room was elegantly decorated with big opening windows in the bedroom and bathroom (no stuffy, steamy rooms). There was good wardrobe capacity so you don't trip over bags.

We set out on foot to find an internet cafe in hopes of finding a new hotel and stumbled upon Hotel Motte Picquet. We were greeted by Sandra, smiling and full of cheer. Her English was excellent. The hotel was adorable, clean, and very inviting. She was kind enough to let us see a room before making a reservation. The rooms were lovely with every amenity we needed for our stay. We booked a room immediately. It is in a great location off the corner of two streets that are filled with locals. Dine in their restaurants, shop in their stores. You are also one block from a Metro station, and a ten minute walk to the Eiffel Tower. During our stay Sandra, Moe, and the entire staff made sure we had everything we needed. I would absolutely stay here again should I make it back to Paris.", "Date": "December 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kohala coast, hawaii", "Title": "\u201cHome Away From Home in Paris\u201d", "Author": "mauna_kea_lady", "ReviewID": "UR11501848", "Content": "Hotel Motte Picquet is a special place.

The staff (Mo and Sandra) at the hotel make your stay a warm, welcome, safe, and comfortable haven. They can help you with Anything - with total efficiency, knowledge, and enthusiasm - they are the greatest. The hotel is very nice, clean, comfortable and affordable.

This is a place where you will get a warm welcome, excellent service, and an immaculate room. The location, just next to the shops and restaurants of Rue Cler and Rue St Dominique, near a metro stop and an easy walk to the Eiffel Tower, is ideal. The personnel at the front desk are first-rate, switching from English to Spanish and German. Mourad can recommend places to eat at every price and will reserve a table, order a taxi, or take your request for a wake-up call. The breakfast, 10 euros during my stay, was a great value. It includes yoghurt, fresh fruit, croissants and pastries, hard-boiled eggs, cereal, juice and coffee. The young women who kept it organized were charming. Visitors should not expect big rooms or elevators in Paris hotels. But a warm welcome and helpful attitude don't depend on price, and this hotel is superior to more expensive hotels where I've stayed where the personnel were cold and condescending. If you're staying in this area and looking for a great place for lunch or dinner, try the Cafe Grennell, just off Rue Cler. The food is great--the 15 euro dinner superior to 45 euro meals we had nearby--and the atmosphere is fun. Warm thanks to the staff of this hotel for making our stay so pleasant.", "Date": "December 10, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Motte Picquet", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d263661-Reviews-Hotel_Motte_Picquet-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$180 - $267*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">30 av de la Motte Picquet</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">7th Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75007</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514869", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/72/6c/42/hotel-motte-picquet.jpg"}}
