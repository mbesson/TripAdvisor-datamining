The negative side is that it's in unlucky position for tourist stuffs...just by the GRA and few over Anagnina metro station (from there I took couple of minutes by taxy). I've been located in an external room, it was a bit in a \"corner\", windows were right on the garden, so I preferred not to open anything...and there was no wifi (at least I didn't found it), but it was very large, well fornitured (king bed, desk for writing, lcd tv) and very clean, with AC and good bathroom. For one night and in \"emergency\" conditions it was more than I expected! I couldn't try the breakfast because I was leaving too early, so they prepared me a take away breakfast...nice from them, althuogh a warm coffee would be nicer (especially because I was leaving 15 min before buffet was opening)...", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangkok, Thailand", "Title": "\u201cGood value of money with reasonable service\u201d", "Author": "r_noi", "ReviewID": "UR119348198", "Content": "Located out of Rome with the cheaper price, shuttle bus service to Anagnina subway station then you can go to central Rome from there, take only 25 min. limited seats for shuttle bus so it\u2019s wise to book ahead. If you want to see Rome at night, it will be some problem as shuttle bus finish by 19.15 hrs. you can ask front office to arrange taxi or shuttle at night (not sure). Front staff is helpful and good English speaking. Room is okay with balcony, toilet is not new but acceptable. Breakfast is limited but just enough to fill you full. Nothing to see around at hotel, it\u2019s in industrial area. So if you just want a place to sleep with reasonable price, this is the one. Not recommend to go to Rome from \u201cCapannelle\u201d train station because no shuttle bus and nothing to see for scenery along the railway.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Odense", "Title": "\u201cDifficult location\u201d", "Author": "toma348", "ReviewID": "UR116510607", "Content": "Nice and large room, good service.
