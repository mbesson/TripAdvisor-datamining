It IS a budget option and there really isn't anything wrong with the hotel itself, but if you stay here you've more or less got to be prepared to stay out all day. The journey into Rome is a bit of a mission, as it takes a bit of time and from now until at least April is further complicated by the closure of Metro line A after 9 o'clock in the evening. Because of this you have to get the B line to Piramide and then walk to Ostiense and get the FR3 overground train to La Giustiniana. From there it's a bus ride or a fairly lengthy walk. We got our info from the review by Intrepid and very useful it was too!!! Thank you. However, there are a few things we'd add. In addition to the Metro closure, the hotel no longer runs a shuttle bus to and from the station, at least not in February. We went for the option of using public transport to get to the hotel from the airport and if we stayed in the hotel again we'd definitely book a transfer to save time and get into Rome earlier. If you do want to use public transport, you need to buy tickets from tabicchi kiosks or some cafes which sell the tickets. Mind you, none of the bus drivers seemed to take any notice if you had a ticket or not! Like Intrepid, we'd also definitely recommend buying a Roma pass. It gets you into certain tourist attractions (we bypassed the massive queue for the Colosseum with ours) and you don't need to worry about getting on and off public transport and where to buy tickets. Having said all this, we really enjoyed our short break at the Prime Hotel Roma Cassia and quite liked being out in the Lazio countryside - we even saw a porcupine when we got off the bus one night!! We met friendly locals on the bus/train and the hotel was comfortable with helpful staff.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel...Bad Location\u201d", "Author": "Gritsnc", "ReviewID": "UR37040656", "Content": "The rooms were great.

He also told us to watch for the major tourist traps in Rome and circled them on a map which he gave us. He recommended the best places to go and had a great sence of humor. A supermaket of sorts is across the road and is great to save you some money. HIGHLY recommend buying bottled water to take into Rome with you as they are almost 3 euros for 1 bottle in Rome. We also bought sandwich stuff to save on some money too. If you intend to drive into Rome dont go without a Sat Nav. Watch the corner roads and scooters...HOLD ON TIGHT! If you have a sat nav, you can find the hotel relatively easy...its hidden down an alley with only a small white and black sign telling you where to turn RIGHT ON THE TURN.

It\u2019s very far out of the city and it feels like a rural area (there is nothing here!). Central Rome is about 30-40mins away by car/taxi (when on the rare occasion there\u2019s no traffic, otherwise it\u2019s longer). It\u2019s one hell of an epic mission to get to the hotel by public transport, requiring multiple forms of transport. When all the timetables line up well the trip can take between 75-90mins, but in one case when leaving the city at 6pm on a Monday night, it took my friends and I a total of 2.5 hrs to get back! So I definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend this hotel for visitors without a car. Even those travelers coming by car will have to study Google Maps pretty well because it\u2019s quite hard to find the hotel amongst the small and unmarked streets. Other than Roma Cassia\u2019s remote and inconvenient location, the rooms themselves are nice, clean & adequate. Being in the sticks, it\u2019s peaceful so you should get a good nights sleep. Unfortunately we had problems with our air conditioning. It didn\u2019t work on one of the days (which in summer was unbearable), but the next day it started working again without us mentioning anything to staff...weird. Then the following day it stopped again!? Confusing. The large hotel entrance & restaurant area is quite nice and there\u2019s also a bar which is quite expensive.

As such not being in the chaotic centre of town, preferably on or near the motorway loop that encircles rome, having some parking and being relatively cheap. This hotel meets all of those criteria. and it was very cheap so thumbs up for that ($40 euro for 2 including breakfast) Saying that, there are plenty of things that are not so good . Firstly its in the centre of nowhere, even thou this wasnt important to us and we had a car but even so, its still miles from anywhere and you have to drive quite a while to find a resturant or anything - so if your on foot - no way - it also is extremely far from the attractions - we had a GPS so it got us there ok - if you dont hope your good with maps The rooms are actually ok, nice and tidy no complaints about the room quality for the price, 4 star would be a stretch but for $40 euro pretty good - the number one problem with this room is in Summer its unbearably hot - sure they have aircon - but its controlled centrally by reception by room - and they keep it off saves power i guess - it was about 30deg plus in our room - and we opened the windows when we first arrived before we figured out you had to go ask for aircon - bad mistake - once you do that - the aircon is disabled in your room - for how long - a true mystery - well they said a few hours - 10 hours later still not on - the woman at reception basically couldnt care less - and said what do you expect if you open a window!. The breakfast which was included was pretty average - sure it was free - but its like one of those proverbs - is the breakfast free if you cant eat it ? - sure had a few things but mostly it was cheap and scarce and a little dubious on how old some of the things were. Internet was wireless only and expensive cant remember how much but it was like $5 euro per hour paid in advance - which was a surprise as we had stayed in about 10-15 hotels on our trip and it was the first and only that charged extra for the internet Ok overall it was cheap and it served our purpose - the heat in the room and the lack of caring was the major issue, and should we have been staying on i would have demanded another room or left as it you simply couldn't sleep . The location is poor if you want to go to the center of town but the price is very good on this occasion. - So up to you - my suggestion if price is your number one criteria and its still cheap and you factor in transportation costs then could be ok - personally i would recommend another place called the Sunrise which is far closer to the attractions and is in the middle of a little village with lots of amenities nearby , nicer and has air conditioning that works a small pool and staff that are friendly and includes a 10x better breakfast, internet, and parking and not a lot more in price.

Me & my wife look for it for about 2-3 hours because that's interesting now - Rome has two train stops called La Giustiniana and they are about 1 hours away from each other. So if you chose that hotel be careful and just to let you know to get from the hotel to Rome town centre you have to walk 10min(if you don't wait for the hotel minivan going once per hour to the train stop and you have to BOOK you seat in it). So you walk 10 min to the bus stop, wait for the bus, then travel 10-15 min with the bus to get to the train station. From there you have to wait and catch the train to Rome. And then you need the Metro to get to the centre. So the trip will take you about 45min may be an hour. BUT when coming back late at night it will ( not may ) take you up to 2 hours as there is no bus from the station to the Hotel ( or its one in an hour ). My advice is if you sightseeing in Rome do not book that Hotel. Is too far from town and when you are tired that's killing you.

I checked on line to find out the route from the airport and time it would take to get to and from the airport by various means of travel. Taxi seemed the best route to get our bearings to start with.This hotel is NOT 25 minutes distance outside the airport as stated, if you add an hour to that you would be nearer the truth, with or without the rush hour traffic as there is NO difference to the traffic any time of day or night there. The first day we spent 240 euro's on 3 taxi fares. The standard rate is 30 to 40 from the airport, what they DON'T tell you is that when you order a cab you get charged from where THEY set off from, we had one taxi driver arrive with 16.10 euro's on his meter before we had even got in it. This is a rip off, even when you insist on the driver quoting you a price it always turns out more when you arrive at your destination. The hotel is most definitely not a 4 star hotel but having said that the decor wasn't too bad and the staff with the exception of the guy on reception during the day (who was a liar) were great, my friend also never slept with the noise coming from the other guests near her room that night. We complained and asked to be moved to their St John sister hotel in the city, even though we had paid in full for our accommodation they said we had to pay another 130 euro's each for moving to the other hotel. To add to the annoyance we went to a restaurant near the Spanish Steps which was situated on a corner one block in from the steps named Angelo's, not recomended, we ordered our meal and had to wait 25 minutes before it arrived, then when it came mine was not the order I placed and it was stone cold, not only that , I could have used it as a frisbee to decapitate someone if I had a mind to throw it ( the waiter was the one in my sights ). I left the meal as just after one bite I decided my teeth were more important to me in my mouth than in bits from trying to chew the pizza, I told the waiter I wasnt impressed with the food or the service but got charged for it all the same. I came back from Rome after 2 and a half days with 16 insect bites and 2000 Euros lighter, I was trying to make the most of a bad trip, to top it off I only had 3 alcoholic drinks the whole time I was there as they were 15 euros each for the drinks I like ( \u00a36 to buy in England ). In the 2 1/2 days I was there I can only conclude after being told by a young Italian woman serving our meal in the evening, that she was sorry were were disappointed with her city, but it is known in Rome that there is one price for the tourists and one price for the Italians I would only go back again if I booked a hotel inside the city and I mean the actual centre, where no taxi's are necessary and you can hop on and off the open top bus to see all the sites as this was actually good value for money, which we eventually got to see. I travelled the length and breath of Italy a couple of years ago and I loved it, but its a thumbs down for Rome also the queuing for 3 - 4 hours for St Peters Basillica etc... what a nightmare. We booked through Ryan Airs website. The other serious compliant I have is that you need to keep your eyes on the ground when you are walking near certain tourist attractions ( coleseum for one ) as around some of them they have short metal spikes sticking out of the ground and like me you could end up on your nose and mouth without knowing what hit you they are very hard to see until you are viewing them from the ground on your way back to your feet.", "Date": "May 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel but it is in the middle of nowhere\u201d", "Author": "Jollyjambo", "ReviewID": "UR14803842", "Content": "This is a nice modern hotel but it isn't a very convenient base for visiting Rome. The Hotel claims to be 20 minutes from the centre of Rome but to get to Terminus station takes,1) a walk up an unpaved and unlit road, 2) a bus journey to La Gustiana Railway Station, 3) a train journey on the FN3 to Villa Aurellia to join Metro A, 4) a Metro journey to Terminus. If you are lucky with the connections this will take approximately 1 hour and if you are unlucky about 1.5 hours. The Hotel does supply a 'shuttle service' to La Gustiana Railway Station but this is infrequent and has limited availability. It also doesn't run on a Monday and isn't linked to the train timetable. The restaurant in the hotel is a big disappointment, it is expensive with a limited selection and the meals were tasteless. There is an extremely limited choice of local alternatives in the vicinity of the hotel. Being close to Rome's Ring Road the local roads are always very busy and pavements and street lighting virtually non-existent. A very basic two course meal for two locally or anywhere else in Rome will cost from 60 Euros upwards. Generally speaking the staff in the Hotel are excellent and the rooms satisfactory. A taxi from Rome FCO Airport will cost approximately 70 Euros. The Leanordo Express from Rome FCO to Terminus Station costs 11 Euros. Once at Terminus you can buy a 1 Euro ticket which can be used to complete the journey on Metro A to Villa Aurellia, FM3 to La Gustiana and a bus (Nos 021, 201 or 223) to Barbarano Romano where the Hotel is (approximately 6 stops). The 1 Euro ticket is only valid for 75 minutes and I don't know what risk you are running if the journey takes longer than that. I asked a taxi for a price from Terminus to the hotel and he said it would be twice the meter fare as it was outside Rome.

I would definitely stay again.", "Date": "November 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kettering, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3401273", "Content": "Spent 4 nights at the Domina Roma Cassia during the week following the Pope's death. Excellent hotel, well furinished rooms, very clean and the reception staff are welcoming and helpful. The restaurant serves good food. Even though it lies in the northern suburbs of Rome, the hotel provides an efficient shuttle to the local train station and then its only 20 mins to St Peters. A shuttle also runs to central Rome every day and it can drop you off at the Zoo (great for the kids!) and there's a pick up at the end of the day.", "Date": "April 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cToo Far Out\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2974600", "Content": "Bit of a headache to find. As not many people spoke English, hard to get directions. Approximately 50 minutes out of town by train. The place was well presented, helpful staff, and good facilities. However found out that a booked double room is only issued if available at time of check in, so out of the 6 days we were there we spent 2 days in 2 single beds, until they could offer us something better.", "Date": "January 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cToo far from Rome central\u201d", "Author": "davey77", "ReviewID": "UR2974501", "Content": "I stayed 3 nights at the hotel. Central Rome was at least 1 hour journey by public transport. There is nothing to do in the local area with nearest town a bus journey away. No swimming pool, gym and no English TV cannels (CNN News). Can very easily get bored. Only one local restaurants (Ok), one good restaurant in the hotel. Very quiet hotel. You need a car if you are going to stay at the hotel or be willing to pay 20 Euros for a cab into central Rome. Better to pay more for a hotel in Central Rome.", "Date": "January 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worksop,UK", "Title": "\u201cGood but quite far out\u201d", "Author": "danlisa", "ReviewID": "UR2604306", "Content": "This was booked through Expedia and the room was very nice, clean and offering good facilitys, the staff are ok too, but it is around 1 hour from the centre by 2 buses, on reflection we should have stayed closer as the buses are jammed full (not nice) and 2 hours per day traveling is too much to do, Rome is to demanding as it is. My advise is book only if you have a car.
