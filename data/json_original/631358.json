We stayed in this hotel over the Christmas market period, and found the location perfect for exploring the Christmas markets, as two of the markets are under 5 minute walk away and all the others can be reached from the U or S Bahn. The hotel is just around the corner for KaDeWe- which you could spend a whole day in to be honest! It took us about an hour and a half to reach the hotel via the U and S Bahn from the airport (but it didn't take us long to get used to the trains), so it only took us 40 minutes on the way back to the airport.

We are a couple in our early thirties and the reviews, price and location was the main reason why I chose the Ellington . On arrival we decided to ask for an upgrade from a standard room to a superior in which we were successful. The hotel was a previous taxation office so the corridors are rather long and clinical looking but not a problem. The room was spacious and clean with large windows giving views out onto the road. Some might find the arrangement of the room odd but we like the minimalist look so it suited us. There were plenty of towels, a safe, hair dryer and a mini bar which for a hotel wasn't to highly priced as others I have stayed. Considering the weather was bitterly cold it was a welcome relief to come back to a heated room. Be aware that check in is after 3pm and check out is midday but they can store your luggage for free which was excellent considering we had an evening flight. We didn't bother with breakfast as it would have been an additional charge and I think they told us 18 euros per person which I think is rather steep and there are plenty of coffee houses around the corner so we ate out each morning at half the price! The hotel is in a brilliant location only a five minute walk to the underground come out of the hotel and turn right and right again and you can't miss it. The area is full of excellent shops, restaurants and bars with a really good vibe so you really are in the heart of the action but without too much hustle and bustle. The reception staff were also very friendly and helpful in assisting us with the local transport and general points of history. I was not aware that most of the big museums close on a Monday and that Sundays are very quiet with most shops closed for the day so plan carefully what you want to do or could get caught out if only here for a couple of nights. One point to mention we did go to visit the Cupola but unfortunately you must reserve beforehand at least a month otherwise you might be disappointed.

We had a large 'L' shaped family room with the children in bunk beds at one end, and the parents in two single beds pushed together at the other. It was great that a hotel thought of families staying and had even included some toys in the room. The only disadvantage was that the shower opens directly into the bedroom, so no privacy if you take a shower, also no iron in the room if you want to press your clothes. We were attending a party so we could hardly complain about the loud music coming from the function room above, but if you do take a family room ensure that there aren't any evening events happening, or you'll be taking part whether you like it or not. Skip the hotel breakfast buffet and walk around the corner the superb bakeries where a family of 4 can eat their fill of patisseries,tea, coffee and juice for less than the price of a single place in the buffet. We had a mix up at checkout where we were not charged the rate that had been quoted to us at booking, probably due to miscommunication, but then again our confirmation email hadn't included any price. Happily this was quickly sorted to our satisfaction, but this might have been avoided with more transparent pricing, which brings me to the internet fees. The hotel charges an unbelievable EUR 24 per day wifi usage, as much as most residential connections cost per month. At that price I would expect my requested web pages brought to me by a butler on a silver tray, not a standard net connection. Equally, the internet access page should have a flashing red warning message informing users of the charges, not hide them away in small print where they can be easily overlooked, especially if you don't read German. At checkout we were able to negotiate the fees down to a more reasonable hourly charge, but I did wish that I'd paid more attention when the inevitable \u201cDad, can we use the internet?\u201d request was raised.

The hotel is very large & the interior design is clean, modern & minimalist. We had a decent sized room (282), however our 'double bed' was actually 2 twins pushed together & with 2 single duvets?! Very soft pillows. Nice & clean room though with the 'exposed' bathroom means that the shower steps straight out into the room but we didn't mind this. Our view was of the carpark behind the hotel & also into the windows of a department store so had to keep curtains closed when dressing! The room was quite chilly & the air con heating didn't warm the room up much so take pyjamas if you're chilly at night. We didn't eat in the hotel, but they told us breakfast was 19 euros each. So we ate at a lovely place called 'My Cafe' right across from the hotel which is very nice. There are also a few restaurants & bars on the hotel street, but generally we travelled into the East of the city to eat & sightsee as a lot more interesting sights & cheaper food. The hotel bar is very stylish with lots of sofas & a jazz theme & even it's own jazz radi station & you can see the dj in a radio booth.

I attended a convention, and no water was on the tables for the 12 hours of lectures we sat through for 3 days. Breakfast was another 19 euros each day, and lunches at the hotel could easily be over 30 euros. Good food but expensive for Berlin. Cafe across the road will feed you breakfast for around 5 euros. Location was great if you like shopping! Close to two train stations as well, and easy walking distance to the zoo. Staff were not overly helpful, but always kept very busy at the front desk. It's a massive hotel. Nothing impressive about this hotel except for that it has the space to cater for several hundred delegates for a big convention.

After 2 days there on occasion of a business meeting held in the hotel, here is my opinion. The lack of security in the hotel is evident. You can easily access the rooms from the road without any control of the hotel staff. When I accessed my room at midnight upon arrival, my room was really cold. Heating system did not do much to revert the situation, and one expects that in a German hotel, where cold is present most of the year, heating systems are way more efficient. My room was simply what I do not want of a hotel room, complicated, improperly designed and thought. Details: there is not a power supply outlet in the working desk nor close to the room table, for internet access, hotel charges the outrageous rate of 3\u20ac per hour, regardless of the time you have been logged on, that is if you are 1 minute you are still charged 3\u20ac, a maximum of \u201conly\u201d 24\u20ac per day I was told in case you inadvertedly forgot to log out. My hotel rate was 160\u20ac/night, without breakfast and without internet access. For such a 4 star hotel, I feel totally ripped off. Breakfast was 19\u20ac \u201conly\u201d and can\u2019t judge the quality as I went to a caf\u00e9 in front and got an excellent croissant and cappuccino which for me is more than enough to start the day. All in all paying such amount of money per night should give you much more comfort and sensation of luxury, other than design. I stayed in room 135, it was located in the 1st floor, sound insulation from nearby street was weak and more important, light insulation was a disaster as curtains, which by the way are a real pain to deploy, provide not enough darkness and it is not nice to hear cars and feel the incoming daylight at roughly 5 am. Besides, if for whatever reason you are in a double occupancy basis (not necessarily being a couple), prepare to shower in an \u201copen\u201d area, as bathroom and shower is integrated in the room. Toilette is separated though. To summarize, I have stayed in far better hotels in Berlin. If you are ready to pay such amount of money, go somewhere else where you get better value for your money. I travel extensively worldwide and fortunately, I have learned to recognize the type of hotels where everything has a cost and additional income from guests is a must.

There were no drawers or shelves whatsoever to put the rest of our clothes in, so we had to practically live from our suitcase with crumpled clothes! Also, there was nowhere to hang towels apart from a small hand towel rail under the sink, meaning bath towels had to be hung over the shower door. The sink had no shelves for your toiletries, and nowhere to put your soap. They supplied a tiny hand soap which was useless. We bought our own liquid soap from a local chemist.

I travel a lot and have never experienced such snobby reception. Maybe it was just one of those being in the wrong place at the wrong time situations, but I'm a paying guest and I don't expect to be handled like a street beggar! Going to your room is a long (long) white hallway, and the room numbers are written on the floor in the carpet. it feels like you've just checked in to a mental asylum. Now I've never checked in to a mental asylum, but now I know what it feels like. The hotel has a creepiness about it. The hotel is a postmodern/minimalist theme, if you like ipod and the color white, this might be just your thing. At first glance it looks calming and nice. But there are a lot of details that have just been overlooked. It's too easy to just paint everything white and call yourself a design hotel!!! The biggest shock was probably the youth hostel style room...The shower is integrated into the room, so when you get out of the shower, expect to be standing naked in front on the bed. Def for friends travelling together, be prepared for some up close encounters!! :) They could have just installed a (portable) wall or sth cheap to separate the sleeping area from the shower. But instead you wake up staring at the sink and towels...youth hostel style. To top it off they didn't consider that wet towels need to be hung amd dried at some point and the nearest wall knobs are near the entrance door. So if you're staying a few nites, and forget that you left your towel to dry on the second day, expect to walk wet from the shower to the door. Another thing that really annoys me (when I pay so much for a room) is the communal shampoo and body wash. the gigantic plastic bottle stuck to the wall upside down for every guest to use (oh how convenient for hair and body!). I'm not nit picky but this is 2* standards. And the question of sanitaryness is always lingering in the back of my head. Speaking of which, they thought enough to give you a free mini soap for the sink, but left no soap dish (i guess they were really following the 'minimalist' theme) so the soap just slides all over the place. There are no convenient shelfs to put your toiletry kit, so basically I left it on the sink where the soap proceeded to make a sticky mess out of the exterior of my toiletry kit. if you use the toilet, located at the entrance of the room, you have to walk around to the shower area to wash you hands. So it seems ironic to me that everything is white in this hotel, whereas hygienical standards have been thrown out the window. The staff is a horror. Not just the useless and rude reception but also the staff in the breakfast hall, yes I was stupid enough to pay 17Euros for breakfast, (the offering was good) but the staff were useless. you have to get your own coffee, or hunt down a carafe. there are plenty of staff but none that pick up dirty plates. They walked by multiple times and just ignored the stack of dirty dishes left from the guests sitting there prior to me, and one or two from my cereal. I didn't dare to ask them to clean it up, for they might have either bitten my head off or kicked me out of the hotel for speaking up!

I know some hotels do charge separately for breakfast, but given the hotel's rates and their classification of four stars, I think this is pretty poor. The layout of the bathroom area is awkward and didn't allow for any privacy. Fine if you are staying as a couple or don't mind being naked in front of your room mate, but pretty embarassing otherwise. Also, all rooms are twin beds with separate linen. This was very uncomfortable as a couple. We had also booked a double only to find that they had booked us a single initially and this had to be corrected. Upon providing a credit card as security on arrival as usual practice, the hotel then proceeded to block the amount for our stay plus an additional \u20ac50 for every day we were staying there, for expenses apparently, on the card. This was close to \u20ac1,000. I have never experienced this practice anywhere before and I have travelled in Europe extensively.

A further \u20ac160 was then mysteriously blocked 24 hours later for what reason we don't know.
