It was too small without a view. However, we agreed to upgrade and pay more and move to a much larger room with a balcony overlooking the canal with a great view of the San Sebastiano Church across the canal. I would call our new room a suite, see photos. The room was quite spacious with lovely appointments which helped carry you back to earlier centuries of Venice. The hotel is small but charming. The only meal available to my knowledge is a continental breakfast and since the weather was so nice we ate outside in the rear garden. The garden is very private for the guests. It takes about 3 or 4 minutes to walk to the water taxi pick up point and there are several restaurants within a one minute walk of the hotel. Our room was quiet and we controlled our air conditioning. Their are two adjoining bathrooms within the suite and one has a large bath tub and the other has a shower. There is no toilet in the bath room with the bath tub/sink; but in the other bathroom with the shower, there is a toilet and bidet, and sink. I loved the large wood table in the room - lots of space to organize your suitcases. There is also a desk next to the fireplace. The bed consisted of two twin beds pushed together. There is no mini bar or safe. It was fun to walk out on the balcony and watch the boats go by on the canal. The staff were helpful and courteous. The hotel helped us to have a very lovely time in Venice. The large old church across from the hotel was closed for construction, but hopefully it will be open by the time you arrive.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "italy", "Title": "\u201ca wonderful \"almost secret\" in my favourite area of venice\u201d", "Author": "waterbird62", "ReviewID": "UR123920688", "Content": "a historical residence with a wonderful garden , conveniently located but at the same time tucked away from the main stream of tourist hordes which often (or in high season) almost always converge on this most magic city of cites. we have stayed here several times over the winter, and where always fortunate to have a very attractive furnished room and comfortable spacious bathrooms. Our bathrooms were not only elegant but huge ( one almost as big as some rooms in venice) well kept, even if a bit dated. Being a historical residence the reality and charm is ofcourse that the rooms vary in size and appearance. The decorating styles of the hotel do have a melange of styles and periods and tastes. Each time that we stayed here, our time spent in venice was enhanced not only by the comfort of our stay and very attractive enviornment, but in particular by the dedicated and very professional and kind staff at both the reception and breakfast area which added special warmth and a special personal touch to all our stays. we travel often for both work and pleasure and in general i am very dubious of any restaurant recomendations given by a hotel reception, but being familiar with venice and the area I was curious as to what they would reccomend in the area. When in the suggestions was included one of our recent favourites, my ears perked up and so we decided to try one located closeby which we didn't know and hadn't heard of: \"osteria ai 4 feri\". I had asked for a ristorant suggestion based on \"simple,casual, local and very correct price/quality\"... we had a wonderful lunch and went back for dinner the next day ... it fit the description more than perfectly plus the ingredients are really fresh and menu is mainly dictacted from the daily market and season. If you are looking for a hotel that is convenient , but tucked in an area where locals& students still manage to outnumber the tourists all year round, but still is only less than a 10 min walk to ponte accademia or a 3-5min walk to the nearest vaporetto stop and a wonderful 30 min walk to san marco or rialto with a warm and very dedicated staff..PLUS the hidden treasure of a beautiful garden to relax or start the day when the weather is nice...than we can only reccomend and hope that you are lucky enough to get a room...we've been here in offseason and so the rapport of price quality was also really excellent!

We'd asked for a room overlooking the canal - room 21 on the first floor - nicely furnished, if a little small. The bed was rather hard for our taste so our sleep quality wasn't great, but that might have suited others so not really a criticism. The only criticism on the room was that they advertise satellite TV with international channels but the only English channel was CNN. We had hoped to watch the odd late film but that wasn't possible. Breakfast was fine - typical continental - and the staff very friendly and attentive. We had a quick look at the garden on our first morning. It did look a bit neglected but could imagine it being lovely in the summer and a real bonus in Venice. The main reasons I think the Hotel should only be 3 star is that it has only a very small lounge/bar area in the reception area so very limited space to relax in if you don't want to be confined to your room after a long day sightseeing (though of course in the summer there is the garden), and there is no restaurant, just a breakfast room, so facilities are limited. This is a great time of year to visit Venice. We were really lucky with the weather, bright sunny days and not too crowded. We walked miles through all 6 'sestieri', booked the 'Venice in a Day' tour - 4 parts, but actually spread them over 2 days - gondola ride, motor launch trip along the Grand Canal with lovely American guide who explained Venice's fascinating history and architecture, and guided tours of both the Bascilica and the Doges Palace. We took the Vaporetti over to San Giorgio - amazing church and best view of Venice from the top of the bell tower. We went to a Vivaldi Concert in San Vidal, the Accademie, the Museo Correr in Piazza San Marco. We found a restaurant quite close to the hotel that had such a fantastic menu that we went back 2 more times (their seafood was incredible, especially paella that was well worth the half hour wait while it was cooked fresh - and the 30 Euros each for the dish!!). We had a ball! I would certainly recommend the San Sebastiano Garden Hotel to friends - as others have said, it was nice to come back to in the evening. One tip worth mentioning. To get to the Hotel on arrival we took the Alilaguna boat (turn left immediately out of the airport and walk 10 minutes along canopied path to the ferry - buy your ticket in the airport before coming out - 15 Euros), but it took over an hour and was dark by the time we got there, taking the magic out of arriving in Venice from the sea. The day we were leaving we simply walked the 10 minutes or so to Piazza Roma and took the bus - only 5 Euros - back to the airport. That way meant crossing about 5 bridges so only really suitable if you've smallish suitcases on wheels. All in all, a great trip. Expensive, but worth it because there simply is nowhere else in the world like it.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona, Spain", "Title": "\u201c\"Lovely hotel away from the tourist area\"\u201d", "Author": "embcn", "ReviewID": "UR120214172", "Content": "The hotel was like a little palace with its own charms and a nice garden in the back perhaps to sit and enjoy reading a book; it was about 10 minutes of pleasant walk to the crowded tourist districts (San Marcos).

We loved our time in Venice and this hotel was mostly part of the nice experience. The staff were friendly and even though our reservation (from Hotels.com) said check-in time wasn't until 2 pm we we checked in at around 1 pm without any problem. All the desk clerks were very helpful and friendly with directions or any help they could give and all spoke good English, which was good for us since we attempted to speak some rudimentary Italian, but wouldn't be able to get very far with it. We had a room near the elevator on the top floor that had a nice balcony that overlooked the garden in the middle of all the houses. The bed was not exactly super-fluffy luxurious like in the high-end US hotels, but it was just fine. I find I sleep just fine as long as the bed is not too hard. One day we were incredibly tired from our travel schedule and slept through breakfast and everything was already cleared away, but Maria was very kind to give us some food and even make us espresso, even though we were hesitant since it was our own fault for missing the meal time. The bathroom had a comically narrow toilet and bidet, but it all worked out just fine. We absolutely loved this location near the south side of the island since it was close enough to many things to do and wasn't too much of a bother to get anywhere, yet it was far enough away from both the train station and Piazza San Marco that we weren't inundated with the bustle of the area around the train station or the relentless annoying herds of tourists all the time. It was probably only a 15 or 20 minute walk to Piazza San Marco. The southern promenade near the hotel also was enjoyable to walk along and it was very close to a Vaporetto stop. There is a grocery store along the promenade around the corner from the hotel and a lively neighborhood with interesting nightlife and places to eat north (or maybe north north east) about 5 or 10 minutes walk. The price for this hotel was very reasonable for Venice compared to things I saw online in other nice neighborhoods there. We were there over part of the holiday weekend before May day and it was hard to find reasonably priced rooms, but the price and the experience were both mostly good. The only bad part of the hotel was the typical European habit of never, ever believing in screens on the windows. You really don't find them anywhere and in Venice it's extra bad because there are mosquitoes that are waiting to drink your blood if you leave the window open, even for a few minutes to cool off. This was a problem because the hotel was not running any kind of air conditioning. It's totally understandable not to run it since the day wasn't too hot and the evenings were pleasantly cool outside. However, this is a big problem with a room with no air circulation on the top floor and all the heat rising. Without the windows open, it was ridiculously hot and stuffy; and with them opened enough to cool off, we were dive-bombed by mosquitoes all night and woke up with a number of itchy mosquito bite welts. Not a very pleasant choice: either roast to death from the heat and not sleep or have mosquitoes buzz by your ears and bite you and wake you up. I'm sure the situation would be different at a time of year when the air conditioning was on, but the hotel either needs to provide some kind of screen to allow people to cool off without the mosquitoes getting in or circulate some kind of cooler air, even if it's just cool outside air run through the air conditioning system. (We tried running air but it just blew hot air which made things worse.)", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riyadh", "Title": "\u201cVenice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Upalia", "ReviewID": "UR119282674", "Content": "Lovely location a bit off the beaten track of the Grand Canal, but worth views of the Lagoon and the restaraunt just along the canal towards the Lagoon.

We booked 2 rooms for 4 people (two couples) on Orbitz. The reservation indicated that check in was at 12:00 pm. However when we arrived at around 12:35 pm, the woman at the front desk informed me that check in was not until \"2 or 3\" and that Orbitz was wrong and a check in at 12:30 was impossible. Very curt and that was the answer, no offer to take my luggage or offer up the lobby restroom. Once I asked if them keeping our luggage was an option, she did agree. So we went to see some sights and eat lunch. When we got back to the hotel at 3:30 (just in case) we may have been the 2 worst rooms in the hotel. Rooms 10 and 11. Room 10 is the first room to the left when walking into the hotel within the lobby. Room 11 is the door in between the staff lobby restroom and the guest lobby restroom. Room 10, the air conditioning was lacking and was full of cob webbs and mosquitoes. Room 11 was just noisy from being mistaken for being the lobby restroom. Both rooms, the shampoo and bath gels provided were open and used, there were dead mosquito smudges all over the walls and ceiling, and the plaster in the bathrooms was moldy and falling down. Lastly upon check out we needed to pay the city tax in cash, not credit card, which was never communicated to us prior to check out. Luckily we had reserved just enough euros to pay for it with getting back to the airport to return home. While the continental breakfast included was minimal, the breakfast waitress was very nice.

This was not just your normal 3 day break, we actually got married in Venice and had the ceremony in the garden of the hotel. We had visited Venice in November 2010 to look for potential venues for our wedding and came across the hotel by accident. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the Dorsoduro area and not located in the centre of the main tourist spots but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only a 10 minute walk to the Piazzale Roma and the closest waterbus stop is only 2 mins away. There is also a supermarket only 2 mins away which was great as you could stock up on food and drink without having to pay all the jumped up prices you find by San Marco Sq and other attractions. We exchanged emails with the manager over the next few months and returned to Venice in March 2011 to have a meeting with the manager to make the necessary arrangements for the wedding. Once everything had been agreed, we continued to have regular communication with the hotel to make sure everything was going to plan. The manager was always very prompt to reply to any questions we had and there were no issues with regards to the language difference as her English was very good. On arrival at the hotel the manager had arranged for our party to be served some Prosecco, a selection of meat and chesses which was lovely. We had arrived before the usual check in time but they were able to get our room ready so that the rest of the guests could put there bags in there and freshen up. The hotel itself was immaculate with a good mix of traditional and modern Venetian design. During our stay there the hotel staff could not do enough for us and were great on the day of the wedding. They closed off the garden in the morning and set up all the chairs and tables and added a few nice little decorative touches to give it more of a wedding feel. The hotel had never held a wedding ceremony in the garden before so everything was a bit of a learning curve, but everything went to plan and it really was an amazing day. We held the ceremony in the garden and then left for the restaurant. We arrived back at the hotel around 9.30pm and the staff had arranged for some speakers to be set up in the garden and cleared an area for our guests to have a dance floor. We could only stay outside until midnight but then moved into the bar area where we stayed until the early hours and even got the night staff to join in on the dance floor! All in all the day could not have gone better. The hotel has 3 types of rooms; classic, deluxe and junior suite. We had one of the junior suites during our stay and it was huge!! A king size bed and also a jacuzzi bath which was great to relax in after a busy day walking around Venice. The room was very clean and without doubt one of the grandest rooms we have every stayed in on our travels. Our guests stayed in various classic and deluxe rooms, and they again were very clean and a mixture of classic venetian and modern design. The pick of the deluxe rooms would be the one located on the top floor with the four poster bed and a great view out into the garden. Breakfast was great. There was a good selection of fresh pastries, cereal, fruit, bread, cheese and also freshly sliced parma ham on request. One of the staff also baked fresh cakes on a daily basis and they were out of this world. The hotel also had a computer in the reception area which you could use to get on the internet and also offered free WI FI for guests. All in all and I speak for our entire wedding party, we would highly recommend Hotel San Sebastiano Garden to anyone who plans to visit Venice. We had a bit of apprehension when we decided to arrange our wedding abroad, especially without the use of a wedding planner, but it could not have gone any better.

It also has restaurants, tabacchi, shops and even a supermarket close by. For a more lively scene in the evening, there's lots of life in Campo S.Margerita, 5-8 mins walk away. The hotel has a lovely tranquil garden too. We were lucky enough to have room 14 on the ground floor, which has hand-painted frescoes on the wall, and overlooks this garden. So far, so good. So what stops me giving the hotel an excellent / outstanding view? A few things weren't quite right about our stay. Firstly, we were givehttps://tonic.tripadvisor.com/img2/x.gifn a very mediochre room. It didn't seem like the deluxe double that I had pre-paid for, and lo and behold, it wasn't. When challenged, Reception admitted they had made a mistake. But I still couldn't say whether the 'mistake' was genuine or not. Then the air conditioning wouldn't work. Reception weren't especially concerned about it, and it never got fixed. For a very hot week, it wasn't comfortable having air-con that only produced heat. This meant leaving a window open (not great on the ground floor), getting mosquito bites, and getting woken up on the hour every hour by a church bell. Next up, breakfast is advertised as starting at 7:30am. On our first morning, they were nowhere near ready to actually serve anyone at that time. The breakfast is adequate, but more 3* than 4* standard. Another day there was no bath towels. The TV is bizarre too... 200+ channels with less than 10 that actually work (but you still have to scroll through them). There's also no hotel information in the rooms. OK... that's enough moaning. Despite all these niggles, this is a TOP hotel. The staff were friendly, and the room was almost a work of art. They just need to have a look at some of the finer detail. But seriously - don't let me put you off! You will fall in love with the area around the hotel.

The bed however was the biggest bed I have every seen! The bathroom was very nice, but it was equipped for disabled visitors, so the toilet had a rather bizarre 'booster seat' on it, and lots of handles and plastic aids everywhere. Whilst this is obviously good for disabled people, it sort of spoiled the asthetic for us. There was a large long garden with a terrace with tables and chairs, which was nice. However it was a bit chilly for us to sit out in the garden long. I imagine it would be very beautiful in the summer with a bit more greenery.

My only complaint about this hotel, was that when we asked for directions to Murano, they told us that they have a free water taxi service to Murano. What they did not tell us (and maybe we were too naive and should have understood nothing in this world is free) is that they have some sort of deal with a glassblowing factory. So, when you get there they usher you into a demonstration (which was interesting) but then they forced you through a showroom of ridiculously expensive glass items and pressured you to buy. Most of the things in the showroom were more than we had spent on our trip, so it was really awkward. And then, the return taxi back did not take us anywhere near our hotel.

The bed was extremely uncomfortable -- you could feel the mattress springs poking into your back and sides. But, it was the bathroom that was the worst part.

In short, no -- they would not replace it.) Also, there was blood on the floor. Apparently, the cleaning staff wasn't as thorough as it should have been.

Everything about the hotel reflects a sincere desire to meet one's needs.

We arrived on the Tuesday and although the hotel had been in up to 8 inches of water in their lobby on the Monday, you just wouldn't have known. This city just knows how to deal with water! The staff were amazingly helpful and kind. They upgraded us to bigger rooms which were all wonderful. Each room is different and includes various antique furniture, which is so much better than the mass produced hotels. The area of the city is out of the heavy tourist areas but the boat bus stop is a short walk away and from there it's a very short ride to all the attractions. We were very lucky to have 2 days of sunshine and a Venice almost empty of tourists!

We also had a private deck (which had no furniture). There is a market a few blocks away-handy for snacks and personal items.

We found a lovely restaurant for each night situated close to the hotel, particularly 'Pane, Vine e San Daniele' which had delicious food and lovely local staff. Generally food in and around the main square is of poor quality so its perfect having a hotel situated in a much more local area, generally we enjoyed our evenings near the hotel and our day around the centre. The hotel itself is fantastic, traditionally decorated, very clean and has a great ambience. The room we stayed in was large with lovely details and a huge bathroom, the best bit was the beautiful view of the canal and church below.
