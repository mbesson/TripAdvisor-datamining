Then we entered the worst hotel room that we've ever had. It was roomy enough, and the location was fine, but the room itself left much to be desired. I had accepted our travel agent's recommendation, because he had managed to find us a room for only $200/night in Amsterdam, whereas everything I had seen was more like $400 and up. Unfortunately, I had only read the online reviews of the hotel a couple of days before we went on our vacation. Luckily, we did not encounter a rat on our bed or drooping ceilings in our bathroom, covered with mold. We did, however, have a toilet that continually leaked, leaving the (marble) bathroom floor continuously wet. A close examination of the toilet revealed that the leak came from the tank, not from the bowl or the plumbing that takes away the waste. That, at least, was heartening. Still, a wet bathroom floor isn't fun. We sacrificed one of the 3 towels we were supplied with, as a permanent mop/rug. And we learned that we could turn off the water to the toilet, so it wouldn't run and leak continuously. In the room itself, all but one of the electric outlets was bare or pulled out from the wall. There were some end table lamps, but there was nothing to plug them into. The furniture in the room was the type that a college student would not accept, because it has been used for so many years. The beds were OK, though, and the overhead light worked. We slept OK, and didn't encounter the bed bugs that some other guests had complained of. Such a deal, for $200/night. The breakfast was fine -- nothing special. Some other reviewers of this hotel said they were afraid to try the breakfast. We did, and it was fine. It consisted of as much coffee as you wanted, bread with nutella or fruit jam, a slice of cheese, and a slice of sandwich meat.

The glass dome was leaking in the lobby and there was a funny smell throughout the hotel. The heating pipes banged all night Friday night! The receptionist lady was lovely - very friendly, men didn't have much to say. Breakfast is brown or white bread, butter with jam/nutella and juice and coffee and that's it! (We only had one breakfast the to eat our in the area was dear at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.50 for a full english!) If you do have breakfast, it's brought to you by the (very slow) staff. There were beer bottles left on our balcony! The ACCA is right across from the Van Gogh Museum and down the road from the Rijks Museum so very central from that point of view. The trams run from the bottom of the road 1 and 5 go into the Centre. I would say to grown ups to stay there only if you've already booked in (as we had), no children!", "Date": "May 14, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "ireland", "Title": "\u201cdump\u201d", "Author": "nellyhickey", "ReviewID": "UR1724145", "Content": "i stayed in the acca hotel for a week,first of all it should'nt be allowed to be called a hotel,our bathroom had leaking water pipes,the heating did'nt work for the first 3 days,we were freezing and it was not possible to get any food in the hotel whatsoever apart from ordering pizza after 6 o clock. the beds were also very badly covered our bed cover was filthy dirty from the first day and was only changed once in the week we were there. i would not reccomend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "March 14, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Acca/Van Gogh", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d277149-Reviews-Hotel_Acca_Van_Gogh-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$99 - $277*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Van de Veldestraat 3A</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1071 CW</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "277149", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b5/04/b5046f8763be916ae88327daff39c6dc4large.jpg"}}
