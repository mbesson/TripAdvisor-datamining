It appeared to have been recently renovated, the bedding was new and comfortable. I definitely recommend the San Lio Tourist House, it's easy to get to from Rialto Bridge (they have a video on their website that walks you through the street, so it's really quite easy to get to).

The check-in was slightly strange in that the main reception and check-in was in a different hotel so we went into San Lio and then spoke to the owner via a TV screen who told us to come to the other guest house to pick up our keys (it was a 2 minute walk). We were able to leave our luggage at San Lio while we did this. The process was simple and problem-free, just a bit strange, although we had been told about it in advance by email. We had booked an economy room but the man at check-in said that he had upgraded us to a standard room which had been renovated 2 weeks ago. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any other rooms so were unable to compare. The room was basic but sufficient. We had clean towels, shower gel sachets and soap, and there was a flat screen TV on the wall. The bathroom looked like it had been renovated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was modern with an excellent power shower. The location of the hotel was central and ideal for sight-seeing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c near to lots of restaurants and shops, between the Rialto Bridge and St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square. Both were about a 5 minute walk away. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overlooking a canal but I think you pay more for that kind of view. Our room overlooked a square which it was noisy (the windows were single glazed) and the curtains were thin, so our night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep was quite interrupted. I imagine it would have been worse if we were visiting during the busy summer season. The other rooms may have been quieter if they were further from the square. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take the breakfast option at the hotel which was an extra 12 euros. Overall, this hotel was comfortable and excellently located for the main sights of Venice.

It can be a little difficult to find on your own, so make sure that you're equipped with a map or some way of contacting the front desk.

The staff were all very friendly and the gentleman at the check-in desk (at the hotel round the corner) spoke excellent English. There is no breakfast or meal service, but with prices so low, it's to be expected. There are several cafes and restaurants close by, though, and even a few mini-markets, so we never found that that was a problem. The pub across the square from the hotel can get a little loud around the weekend, so this may be a problem for light sleepers.

The location is great, only a few minutes from the Rialto Bridge and a short walk to St Marc Square. These are both sign posted in yellow and therefore it is easier to get about without getting lost. I absolutely loved Venice and would love to go back one day.

We tried to arrange our accomodation via Hostelworld.com.

We duly contacted our credit card provider and learnt that they had not had any request from the hostel regarding the credit limit on our card regarding our stay. We then contacted the hostel and found that they refused to check our credit card details over the phone, and claimed that they would only accept these details via email (HOW INSECURE WOULD THAT BE!!) The hostel then proceeded to re-sell our room, leaving us with nowhere to stay and forcing us to arrange a last minute alternative at increased cost. An additional aside - hostelworld.com have still not replied to our e mails for help in this matter, and we are still trying to retrieve the deposit that we paid them to gain what they confirmed as a secure booking with the hotel.", "Date": "May 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel was a great find in Venice\u201d", "Author": "gossipandtravel", "ReviewID": "UR10062250", "Content": "We actually found this place on hostel world, but it was more of a hotel than a hostel.

Much of Venice is operates hugely inflated prices and this is the exception. The location is superb. You are literally 5 mins walk from the Rialto and, therefore, pretty much in the centre of Venice. The rooms are small but perfectly adequate, very clean indeed and quiet. The Dutch bar did not bother us (a previous review complained about the noise) and in fact it was a very welcome place as one of the few open after 11pm! If you want quiet insist on a inward facing room (ours was) and it's perfectly quiet. It's not luxury by any means but it's not a hostel either.
