It is NOT a gay hotel. The only resources there for gay travellers were a couple of out of date maps. There are 2 sides to this hotel. We pre booked on the internet and gave a credit card for a deposit. Once we did that we were trapped by their cancellation policy. We stayed 5 nights and were given a room downstairs at the back of the main hotel. The room was large, it was summer, the was a small fan that sounded like a plane taking off. The only ventilation was from a window without screen that opened onto a roof littered with cigarette butts, stagnant water in drain pipes and a couple of used condoms. With the window open we got devoured by mosquitoes and the walls and ceiling were smeared with the blood and remains of mosquitoes squahed by previous guests. No attempt was made to clean them. We asked for another room but were told there was none. I said I had noticed a better room at the front was vacant and was told that room was for 3 people not 2 and a lot more expensive. The next day I heard the receptionist rent the room to a single woman who walked in off the street and the rate was about 2/3 of what we were paying for a vastly inferior room. We also heard another man who had booked in advance and was tied into their cancellation policy leave his room and move to another hotel because it was so bad. The receptionist spoke to the \"boss\" over the phone and the boss said that the man would be charged for his full stay even though he was not going to be there and later that day I heard the receptionist let the room at a greatly reduced rate to someone who phoned up and then arrived from the station without booking ahead. There are some ok rooms at this hotel but they seem to be reserved for walk ins and people who book on the day. Those who book in advance are given inferior rooms at inflated rates because they are captives to the cancellation policy whllst those who are not tied into the cancellation policy are treated very differently with better rooms at cheaper rates. Also when we were there, there was a street festival on. The street were packed with drunk people and the owner opened the toilets in the hotel to the public, charging people 2 euros each to use them. This meant queues of drunk loud people in the corridors and that the guests sharing these facilities had to wait in a line. In addition despite heavy volume of use there was no extra cleaning of the toilets.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington, United States", "Title": "\u201cRustic, comfortable and friendly\u201d", "Author": "Xristo P", "ReviewID": "UR125526644", "Content": "I enjoyed an attic room overlooking the canal, the room was clean and just enough room for a single.

We arrived just after midnight on the 9th February and was informed that our room was just around the corner. We left the main part of the hotel and went to the left then across the path where the roadworks were taking place. It was then we were lead into what can only be described as the room from hell, it was disgusting with the walls marked, poorly decorated, mold on the ceiling, cupboard literally falling apart, broken tills on the floor of the bathroom . . . the list goes on. It would have been fitting had you paid 20 euros a night, we of course had not and when I discovered the human hair and stained quilt cover that was the final straw, this unfortunately was in the morning after one of the worst nights sleeps in my life!! We immediately went to reception and not only complained but took the opportunity to show the receptionist the photos which would be uploaded onto Tripadvisor on our return. The receptionist was absolutely brilliant, could not apologise enough and explained we will be moved once the room in the main hotel was available (around 12 that day). Thankfully the one which was marked for us (double room) was not available and we got the twin which was perfectly located at the front of the building and included a view of the canal. The room was clean, carpeted, big bathroom, comfortable and clean bed and black out curtains, stark comparison to the other room. The hotel is around a 20 minute walk into Damn Square and even shorter to the first group of pubs, resturants and cafe's. As it was -10 degrees celsius we did not ventur out too far, however, we did make the history museum which was very informative and the sex museum which was utter rubbish! If you are going for the \"smoking\" cafes there are no shortage with one on almost ever street, the journey from the airport via train is about 10 mins and the central station is about a half hour walk from the hotel.

Ok so I'll start with the good stuff! Me and my partner arrived here about 12 in the afternoon and as check in wasn't until 2 thought we'd go say we're here, drop our luggage off and have a wander round however our room was ready when we got there so we popped straight up to dump our stuff. I've read people complain about the stairs in Amsterdam hotels before but I think they're lovely and quaint. The bed was quite comfy and warm too, I mean who doesn't like a comfy bed! The location was brilliant, it was a 10 minute walk from Rembrandt square which is choc-a-block full of bars, shops, coffeeshops and the like, a very nice place to wind the day away in. When we go in to our room I noticed our window was open so I tried to close it but it wouldn't no matter how much a pushed here and there and neither could my boyfriend so when we went back down we asked if it could be closed and the woman at reception said it would be later on that day (which it wasn't, nor was it throughout our 3 days there). The toilet door didn't shut properly, there was a good 2 inch gap so if you are in the room we were I hope that you're a very close couple of very good friends. Our towels were changed every day which was good but our sheets weren't changed once. Now for the worst part. I am very suseptable to insect bites, gnats that sort of thing when I go away...to warm tropic places. However every morning when I woke up I'd find another 2/3 bites on my body somewhere, really painful and itchy, very unsightly to say the least. My boyfriend also got some and he never gets bitten. I don't want to say the b word but I think there might have been bed bugs in our room, the weather there was almost identical to it is back in my home town in England and I haven't had any bites here. I think this is the thing that got to me most. I can put up with a dodgy toilet door, dodgy shower anything, just not bed bugs. Apart from that I'd recommend the hotel as it was a very good price considering the location, I would have defiantly stayed here again if it was just going to be me and my partner in the room with no little visitiors but now I wouldn't.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Radioorange", "ReviewID": "UR114925340", "Content": "This is the second time I've stayed at the ITC in Amsterdam.

Then on the other hand you have those budget hotels that over the years have become so worn and run down that they cannot pretend they are any but a budget hotel. And ITC Hotel definitely belongs to this second category. The hotel is centrally located and that is perhaps its only good feature. Overall the hotel gives a rather run down feeling, with the stairs/hallway in need of a paint job and the smell of smoke/marijuana permeating the building, the hallways and the rooms as it definitely does not look like this hotel has a non-smoking policy. My room was a decent size for Amsterdam standards, but that probably was mainly because I had opted to go for a double room instead of a single room, which I feared would be too small. The room was rather noisy, with sounds coming both from the hallway and the upstairs room, the bed sheets smelled strongly of smoke, things like the remote control and the lamp above the sink weren't working and I couldn't say the room was overly clean.

The hotel we stayed in was not ITC but the Townhouse, which is just over the other side of the Prinsengracht. We had booked a double room, but were given a twin room which we were not totally happy with as it was also very small, but there was a shower and hairdryer which we had not expected. We were given fresh towels, soap and bed linen each day, and the hotel was quite clean. However, there was a thick glue-like substance on the windowsills which was not removed and the table had a number of stains on it and looked as though it had not been cleaned for some time! Also, there was no wardrobe nor coathangers and no kettle, despite the fact that we had been provided with coffee, tea and cups! I was also extremely disconcerted about the lack of staff. Despite the very friendly receptionist we did not meet any other staff members during our entire stay! I believe that the Townhouse is actually unstaffed as on the Wednesday morning we were woken at 8am by a smoke alarm, followed by a door alarm. This was because a group of individuals on our floor had been smoking cannabis in the shared toilet facility and had run away from the hotel once the alarms went off. We had to wait outside for some time until the hotelier from over the way at ITC came to switch off the alarm. In fact, he said that this must not happen again as the alarm wires had to be cut! Goodness knows what should happen if there is a real fire in the hotel. Also, the hotel has a strict no-smoking policy according to a number of sources yet the smell of cigarette and cannabis smoke was almost constantly present. Despite these negatives, however, the hotel is in a good spot and provides the value for money that is to be expected from a 2 star hotel.

I was surprised at how much they were able to cram into a tiny room: a closet big enough for my 2 backpacks, a sink, a desk, 2 chairs, a nightstand and a single bed with an extremely large mattress. If you went out the window, you were on the roof! I appreciated having the basin in the room, and the bathrooms were kept clean. Walls are thin, and one night I heard every word of the neighbor's conversation with whomever was on the other end of his telephone. The free wifi worked surprisingly fine up there. It wasn't so fun hauling my bags up 4+ flights of steep stairs, but I managed. The last staircase into the attic was VERY steep and at 5'8\", I had to duck to avoid the low ceiling. When I checked out, I had my 65 liter pack on my back and actually got stuck when my pack got wedged between a stair and the ceiling!

Checkout time was 12:00 and I had left in the morning of my checkout day to get some breakfast and run some last-minute errands. My flight wasn't until mid-afternoon, so I wanted to occupy the room until checkout time. I came back at 11:30 and the door to the shared bathroom was locked and my room had been cleaned - with my bags still in the rooms. The housekeeper looked visibly irritated that it was approaching noon and I was still there, though I had every right to be. She appeared to have finished cleaning the rooms on that level and had unlocked the bathroom door, so I was able to go in finally. I went back to the room and washed my hands and brushed my teeth in the clean sink, wasting a new bar of soap, and feeling unnecessarily guilty and more than a little bit annoyed. The front desk gave me a roll of breath mints when I checked out as a gift. An important note about this hotel is that they do not have a no-drug policy like some of the other hotels in the city.

To start with this place is a Canal House not a modern hotel. Which is, yes the stairs are really steep and there's no elevator ( no comfortable if you have heavy or a lot of baggage ) and what travellers might expect from a hotel are not going to get at this place. Even if posted on the hotel website, there's no bar but wending machine, breakfast is served by the receptionist on the 2 tables that are available for ( with a very nice view indeed ), no toiletries in the room, no safe & no internet. When I visited ( Nov. 24,2009 ) there were works on the rail line of tram nr. 4 which included a diversion to a different stop. Keep in mind you will need between 10 and 20 minutes by foot depending on where you get off to reach the hotel. Don't rely too much on the door bell when checking is, as it is not always attended ( in my case, I was waiting for a good 6 mins before a guest came out of the building to let me in ). After you are checked in you will receive your own key though. Rooms are very basically appointed and furniture shows the ages. In my room 2 main light bulb were not working or missing and no one ever replace them. Some linen were stained. The room overlooked the opposite building, 20 meters aways, so you could see inside the other places but no view of the canal and not even the sky. There's no really a bathroom but a separate shower & toilet were closed off by a door, which didn't close propely, while a sink was next to the bed. There was a folded away table attached to the wall. Walls are also not that soundproofed. The reception was always attended but I only found one lady very helpfull with informations and directions. The location of this place is very interesting and at the time of booking for a double room single occupancy I paid 59 \u00e2\u201a\u00acuros without breakfast, though the room wasn't really double and if you pay the bill with your C/C you will get a 3% surcharge.

Welcome to room no.23. Everything was there - walls, ceiling, bed, window, shower, toilet, sink, etc, but it looked like it had been put together by the local homeless people after a long night on the booze and weed. Our first night (Saturday night) was the noisiest night we have ever experienced in a hotel, and we hardly slept, if at all. Not a good sign. The following morning we went straight round to reception to ask to be moved to a quieter room, only to be told the hotel was fully booked (\"its the weekend ya'see - we're busy\"). We were offered a quieter room at the back of the main hotel building for the third night, at which we, relunctantly, agreed. During these high-level negotiations they constantly warned us that this new room was smaller than the one we were currently in. And we stupidly thought that was simply not possible! Oh, how wrong we were.... The second night initially proved quieter (fewer drunks outside at 1 in the morning), although still in the room overlooking the main road, so we got to enjoy trams trundling past every 15 minutes until some time after midnight. That is, until about half past two when the fire alarm went off. Or rather, stayed on for about 5 minutes, which is a long time when a loud sounder is blasting you from deep slumber, scaring my wife half to death (not a good thing for a pregnant woman). Day three and we packed our bag, said goodbye to number 23, and looked forward to breakfast and a new room. We headed off into Amsterdam filled with a sense of hope. Oh, how innocent and naive. On return to the hotel we eventually found room number 19. There are photos and a description of this room already on this site in the review by Braxn. Suffice it say this room suffers from Inverse Tardis Syndrome - its smaller on the inside! Yes, this room _was_ smaller than the one we had come from.

The foyer (really just a lounge room with a desk) is full of old mismatched worn out furniture. Our room was located at the back of the hotel and as soon as we opened the door we could smell that dank smell of mould and dust. The room itself was small and again full of old furniture and carpet. There was only one small window which was located inside the shower and it took quite a bit of effort to force it open. The shower looked like it was a converted cupboard with slat doors, that couldn't close properly, in place of a shower curtain. I suspect this is partially why the place smelt so bad as the water would invariably run straight onto the carpet. The toilet was seperate (thankfully) but it was small and virtually impossible to escape without bumping your head against the wall at some point. The bed was this rooms crowning glory (not). It was either broken in two or it had a severe sag in the middle which gave us both backache. The last straw was when I woke up in the middle of the night with my face up against the wall breathing in the most digusting smell of mould. Needless to say we checked out after one night and I regret not doing it when we first sited the room. What added insult to injury was that we were led to believe this was a gay owned or at least gay friendly hotel. There is nothing to distinguish this hotel from any other and got the impression it was just a marketing ploy to pull more business. Of all the hotels that I stayed in my recent around the world trip this was the only one that I did not check in Trip Advisor prior to my booking. I have learnt my lesson the hard way.", "Date": "June 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cVery Pleasing\u201d", "Author": "Davey20", "ReviewID": "UR6836271", "Content": "The location of the hotel was perfect, and along with it's nicely presented rooms and friendly staff made this a very enjoyable stay. We spent 1 week there during mid-February. We found the staff to be very helpful and quick to tend to our needs. Everything we asked of them was attended to in a very timely manner. The stairs in the hotel were quite steep which might present a problem for some people, it was quite difficult to get our luggage up them. The rooms were comfortable, welcoming and fairly tidy. Granted they weren't the most modern rooms we've ever seen, but we were pleased nevertheless.

The hotel is seedy, dirty, unkept and has the feel of a rent by the hour motel!! We arrived checked in went to our room and turned right back down to the reception area. The bedroom was damp, the bathroom was filthy and there was no soap. The decor was shabby. When we complained and said we would be checking out... all we got was attitude and told they would be charging us for 2 nights stay!!! We attempted to argue that the room was not what we had been sold on the website but the woman we spoke with would not hear anything we said. She kept saying you knew it was a 2 star hotel... well yes we did and we have stayed at some amazing 2 star hotels in Paris and Barcelenoa ... netheir was dirty and unkept like this place.
