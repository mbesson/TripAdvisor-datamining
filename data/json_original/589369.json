{"Reviews": [{"Content": "not bad, just not very impressive I selected this motel because it was only a mile away from my in-laws' house in what my wife would call the hood part of Dallas. (Her family is African American and lives there.) After I'd made the reservation, her nephew drove by and said, I wouldn't stay there. Apparently it's not far from the projects. Well, the neighborhood wasn't bad--we certainly didn't feel in danger at any point, and we had our young son along--but the motel itself was unprepossessing. The room was large and clean, but had no towels. (They were quickly provided when we asked.) The TV worked, but not terribly well. There was a hair dryer but no coffee machine. The refrigerator and microwave worked well. The breakfast from 7-10 promised by a sign in the tiny check-in area turned out to be a pot of coffee, powdered creamer, and one lonely pastry for takeout from the aforementioned check-in area. Parking was quite safe, since the entire courtyard was enclosed with just one drive-in and drive-out lane that passed by the office. There's a great health-food supermarket, curiously, only a two-minute walk away. Easy access to the highway. This place was certainly overpriced for what it delivered (at the $86, including tax, that I paid). I believe it was rated at two-stars, but it is simply a budget one-star motel: a passable accommodation (I've been in worse), but not a great value. As for the talk about romantic boutique and the like--I didn't see that.", "Date": "Jan 5, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR499000809", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "AverageAcademic"}, {"Content": "I Loved the CareFree Inn and Suites We stayed at the CareFree Inn and Suites and loved it. The property is new with Junior Suites and Jaccuzzi Suites. It was my Birthday and my Husband suprised me with a night on the town. The hotel was intimate and a private getaway for us, after we did in the town in Dallas West End. The room was large squicky clean and had marble baths. The towels were large and fluffy and they also had pillow top beds already turned down for us when we entered our suite.
