The internet connection at the hotel is not efficient. We had to go to the lower floor to gain access thereto. And the receptionist told us that there is an unsecured internet connection, so he was like saying that the hotel internet is not that reliable. Breakfast at the hotel consists of bread, assorted cookies, muesli, coffee, milk, juice, cereals, and yogurt. There's not much variety but you can still be full with these. We spent our 4-day stay exploring Venice and other Italian cities so we didn't get to spend that much in the hotel room.

It was horrific. Itsmelled like mold and vinegar, the only window led out to the corridor, where the light shown in nonstop( the shutter was broken so I couldn't block out the light).The shower was simply a drain in the floor next to the toilet. No stall, no curtain, nothing. Just aim the water as best you can in the drain or toilet. The blanket was dirty and stained, and when I took it off the bed 2 moths flew out. I was in shock and so tired from my long flight. I agreed to spend 1 night there if I couldn't find another place that day, since I was alone. I found another hotel but they had no room for that night so I sat outside in the rain until 1:30 in the morning and ran out at daybreak. I said I wasn't paying a dime more than the 10% deposit I made online for that horrible room. The rest of my stay in Venice was fabulous, and I soon forgot the Hotel Astoria.
