The service was spectcular and the food was excellent. They knew we were arriving early to Paris (6am) so by the time we got to the hotel within 5 mins we were brought to our upgraded room where we were escorted from the front desk and our luggage seconds behind us (they first asked if we prefer breakfast first). When we did arrive to our room our butler Charles was kind enough to explain what our amenties are in the grand room. We were upgrade from the Jr Suite to the Executive Jr Suite which basically is a better view and a better view we got. It overlooked the Champs Elysee and true to what I read the room was sound proof. Never once did we hear the noise from the street unless we opened our balcony doors. The room was always clean and our great mini bar was always stocked. The couple of afternoons we were in our room little treats were sent up which was really a nice thing to receive. We ate dinner one night at Fouquet and the food was excellent and the wine recommendation was the best red wine I ever had! We also got back late one evening and was a bit hungry and they were able to have Le Diane prepare us some delicious appetizers from their menu. Luckily that night they were open a bit later for another table so we were able to sit there and enjoy our treats and never once did they rush us. Their breakfast was also lovely and great choices. One morning I wasn't too hungry and they must've mistaken that for me not liking their food because they offered to make me something off the menu, it was so sweet of them to notice and ask. It was the first time in Europe for my husband and we have traveled to many places and I am so happy that this first experience will cause us to have many more in the future. Thank you again for the outstanding service. Special thanks to their conceirge staff, AMAZING! They helped us with so much even before we arrived to Paris, thank you! Maxim and Mauro were wonderful and so warm each time we saw them! I'm sure the other people at the front desk is as warm but it seemed like Maxim or Mauro were just always there to greet us.

Fouquet's. Prior to my visit I thought that comment odd, but I can understand it now. While stylish and edgy sometimes, the room chairs and couches are not designed for either long-term comfort or nestling with a good book (why nestle, why stay in your room with the heart of Paris right outside!?--you are right to ask!). However, the large suite bed was extremely comfortable if one wanted to coccoon. Butlers were helpful and most (except one gent) were unobtrusive. The cuisine was both fresh and delicious with much variety of choice. Spa reception was marred by staff at desk bungling appointments, assuming that people somehow never make sequential appts (so, if you booked a massage followed by foot reflexology--they repeated to me a number of times: \"you cannot have a foot massage and a regular massage at the same time\"-well, duh, you can say that again--and they did...). Fortunately, therapist intervened and both treatments were had (not consecutive, mind you!). A trip to the hotel bar was not altogether pleasant initially. I forgot to wear my Euroblacks and arrived in jeans (but black shirt) whereupon, thin blonde non-smiling lady asks: \"can I help you sir\"? Let's see, gentleman (I really am) walks into bar and hostess might optionally say: \"here for a drink or to eat--where would you like to sit?\". She was unable and after I stated I would like a drink, she was silent, gestured with her hand down the bar. I took off and was immediately intercepted by black (of course)-suited gentleman who said (guess what?) \"can I help you sir\"? At this point, I secured eye contact and said:\"I'm a guest at this hotel and I would like a drink\". He gave up and reluctantly seated me. I ordered my martini (deflected the \"dirty martini\" encouragement) and relaxed. At that point, I rather strategically took out my suite key and placed it on the table. Guess what? Service improved 100% with bartender coming over to inquire as to the correct amount of vermouth, etc. Waiters so much more soilicitous. I suspect I am making this more of a \"big deal\" than I politely should, but there was that strong whiff of anti-something. Nuff said. Overall, I would return because of location, cuisine, and concierge/reception/room service. (Laura will be grabbed soon as an assistant to some European President, I'm sure).

This is a membership to have if you travel a lot. You get guarantee upgrade, breakfast for two, free internet. If you stay 5 nights, you already get your membership paid for. Imagine getting an upgrade during a high season in a 5 star hotel on Champs Elysees. We got there about 2:30pm and check in time was 3:00pm, the manager was very embarassed that our room was not ready. He told his people that he was not happy about this and made it up to us by inviting us to have a drink up in the cafe. The room was moderned with two minibars and every things in the minibars are included and everythings mean many bottles of perrier and other sparkling water, sodas, juices, and M&M. there is a nespresso and a tea pot with teas from Tea Forte. We got a fruit basket, many chocolates from La Maison, and nightly chocolate on a turn down service. The room was clean and the heater was comfortable and quiet. There is a tv in the bathroom. the sound system was high quality. You can take a bath with classical music. They also give you a his and her Hermes products. There is a good size swimming pool with comfortable temperature and a slim trail where you walk against a current which was very hard and a good work out. The sauna and steamroom were very clean and nice. The locker is a little small but equipped with everything you need. There are complimentary tea, coffee, dry fruits and nuts available during your swim. There is a gym with treadmill and some sort of eliptical machines but we were so busy that we did not get a chance to try. there is also a power plate which is great for loosening your tired muscles. We did not have a chance to try the Le Diane because it was fulled on New Year's Eve and was not open during our stay. Food at the Fouquet was just ok but very expensive. Breakfast was wonderful. The juices were freshly squeezed. Best orange and grapefruit juices I ever had. We had the best time and will not stay in any hotel again. We have stayed in Le Meurice and Hotel de Crillion. Hotel de Crillion was old style and beautiful but the fact that you paid almost 1,000 euros per night and don't even give a bottled water during turn down was absurd. Le Meurice room was elegant but stuffy. The restaurant at Le Meurice was very special. I have to say that we love to stay at nice hotels.

The reception staff, and indeed all staff, were professional..with sincerity and kindness in their welcoming demeanour. The room was luxurious..food wonderful..many breakfasts eaten on the peaceful, serene terrace with attentive service from Miguel. The terrace was a restful haven after a day of sightseeing or shopping with the staff of the Lucien bar welcoming us \"home\". The Birthday Dinnner at Le Diane was exquisite and the hotel's gift of champagne and birthday cake was wonderfully generous and thoughful. Although personal butler service was experienced in other locations the attentiveness of Charles and Laura was unsurpassed.

We owe a special thanks to Monika who inspired the staff to live the dream with us.

It was our first time in Paris, and we did extensive research in advance. We travel high-end, and had narrowed our choices to Fouquet\u2019s, Four Seasons-George V, and Plaza Athenee. The three features that led us to choose Fouqet\u2019s were: (1) reviews noting how helpful the concierge staff was at Fouquet\u2019s, versus what seemed to be an approach at the other two where the concierges expected a more seasoned European traveler with fewer need for particularized recommendations and advanced planning; (2) the included breakfast buffet, which for Americans used to eating a large breakfast before full days of touring and sight-seeing was key, and would have added 100 euros to the daily rate at the Four Seasons and the Plaza, where neither have included breakfasts; and (3) the U-Spa. In sum, we were extremely pleased with our stay and experience at Fouquet\u2019s. A note on prices: none of the three hotels above are for the financially faint of heart. It\u2019s all a matter of expectations. I\u2019m sure there are 100\u2019s of other great choices throughout Paris at every rate class. We landed on a junior suite for 1,070 euros/night. The rate at Four Seasons was equivalent, and the rate at the Plaza for an equivalent suite was approx. 1,300 euros. The room: our suite was gorgeous; larger than we expected. While the suites come with butler service, we could never find a way to use it without feeling pretentious and awkward. Huge bathroom, separate shower and full jacuzzi tub with flat screen TV over the tub. Welcome basket of fruit lasted all week, and the fully-stocked free mini fridge was great. Hotel food: we ate dinner at Fouquet\u2019s on our first night (Sunday). The food was great. We had lunch there another day. We indulged, and ate at two different Michelin-starred restaurants (Alain Ducasse and Pierre Gagnaire) over the course of the week, and at Jules Verne for my wife\u2019s birthday. While Fouquet\u2019s food doesn\u2019t compare, I think we have a good foundation to evaluate it and you can\u2019t go wrong for solid brasserie food with a great people-watching spot on the Champs-Elysees. Concierge: we were really pleased with the genuine and non-pretentious help we received from the concierge staff, both before we arrived (they made our reservations at the three restaurants noted above, including getting us in my view the best window table at Jules Verne for my wife\u2019s birthday dinner) and during our stay, with lunch recommendations and others. They even had our butler deliver a complimentary bottle of champagne and a large desert to our room on the night of my wife\u2019s birthday. Unfortunately, we had just came back from a three-hour indulgent meal at Jules Verne, and could only taste one bite each, but it was the thought that counted. Negatives: there were only two \u201cnegatives\u201d I can think of, and frankly they are minor issues. One was referenced in the most recent review, which is the cost of hotel-secured transportation to/from Orly, where we flew into. The cost was approx. 325 euro each way; we didn\u2019t know any better, so we paid. The transport was convenient, in a large Lexus sedan, but the cost was ridiculously high. I\u2019m sure we could have secured similar arrangements for much lower cost, and will do so in the future. The other was an issue we had at check-in with one particular hotel desk clerk. We arrived in Paris from New York at 9 am on Sunday morning, and were at the hotel by 10 am. We didn\u2019t book an extra night, so we recognized that we might not get to check-in until later. Check-in is 3 pm, but we had a specific suite booked, and we\u2019ve never had to wait until check-in time at high-end hotels in Europe (or the US for that matter) when booking a suite. The first female clerk told us the room should be ready by noon. Between noon and 3 pm, a different male clerk kept putting us off, reminding me every time that check-in was 3 pm. I thought he was unfriendly and worried we were getting off to a bad start. At 2:40 pm we came back to the front desk for the third time, and he told us to sit in the waiting area. At 3:01 pm he came over and said the room was now ready. I think he was lying and decided to make us wait until 3 pm on the button to prove some point. It was obnoxious, and he seemed fake at every moment. We actually had another minor issue with the same clerk the day before we checked out. Because the room was not ready on Sunday until 3 pm, we had breakfast at the hotel while we waited. We then slept in on Monday morning and didn\u2019t use our free breakfast that day. To avoid the extra 100 euro charge (on a hotel bill of well more than 10,000 USD), we asked if our Monday breakfast could be applied to Sunday. He acted snooty and made me feel like we were asking for a free night or something. he made a big show of calling the General Manager, who quickly approved the credit. The whole process was distasteful for such a high-end hotel. I wish I had noted his name, as I would have separately emailed the Manager to complain about what I perceive as a lack of professionalism by this individual. This is my first ever review of a hotel on any website, so I hope it\u2019s not too long-winded. I was surprised that there is so little information about Fouquet\u2019s (the hotel) out there.

My wife ordered scrambled eggs one day which were odd - came in a bowl and very undercooked which they admitted. It was not a great buffet but enough.

This was our first stay at Fouquet's in Paris. Right from the word go we were pretty sure we were going to enjoy it. Check-in was quick and simple and staff very welcoming. We had booked a junior suite and were upgraded to a larger suite for the same rate. We were travelling with our three children aged 12, 10 and 6 so we need quite a bit of space. Both suites offered us that with 2 separate rooms and separate toilet and bathroom. The rooms are tastefully decorated and everything works. When we inquired about a DVD player for one of the flatscreen TVs, our butler was there plugging one in within 10 minutes. The location of this hotel is just fabulous and was one of the reasons we chose it. Ten minutes walk to L'Arc de Triomphe and I would guess 20 minutes to the Eiffel Tower. Fouquet's started life years ago as a fashionable Parisienne cafe and place to be seen. It's easy to see why.

We ate at Fouquet's cafe on one occasion, choosing to book a babysitter for the evening who spoke faultless English and was great. Food was excellent (Dover Sole) if expensive (with that location not surprising) and was not that hot (temperature) but a fabulous atmosphere and a real treat. Breakfast in the hotel was delicious with excellent personal service from the staff. We ordered room service on two occasions which we found to be prompt, hot, delicious and well presented. Access to the beautiful underground spa and pool were included in the room rate. The spa looks very new and is clean and quiet. The fitness centre is small but had the basic cardio machines and some free weights and floor mats. Fabulous swimming pool and Hammam pool/jacuzzi. This team really knows how to run a hotel and we were very sorry to leave. We will look forward to returning just as soon as we can.", "Date": "November 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taipei, Taiwan", "Title": "\u201cMost amazing hotel I've ever stayed at in Paris...great staff, great location!!!\u201d", "Author": "northstar_jojo", "ReviewID": "UR46818018", "Content": "This is truly one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had in my life!

Although it was June, we arrived on a rainy, cold Parisian day. Our welcome was so unusually friendly that I thought they were mistaking me for someone else. Ms. Bruley came over and told us that she had a wonderful surpise for us but that our room wouldn't be ready for another ten or fifteen minutes. She invited us to go up to the bar and have whatever we wished, compliments of the hotel. We were escorted upstairs to a gorgeous bar, which also serves as a resturant for breakfast and lunch with a beautiful and comfortable terrace outside, complete with sofas and very comfortable chairs. The room itself is decorated in colors of eggplant and lime green... exquisite. The service was impeccable. After 15 minutes Ms. Bruley arrived to show us to our room. I had booked a junior suite, a definite extravagance in Paris, but it was our 30th anniversary and this was a celebration. When we stepped into our room, my mouth fell open. She asked if we liked it. She had upgraded us to a full suite that took my breath away. There were a dozen roses in the livingroom and another dozen in the bedroom and fresh peonies in the bathroom. There were 3 plasma tv's, one of which hung over the sunken tub in the bathroom. 8 or 9 floor to ceiling French windows that opened out over the quiet and landscaped courtyard. The shear luxury of the suite took my breath away. Now I was convinced they had mistaken us for someone else! I looked at her and told her I might just never leave our suite. She pointed to a bottle of champagne chilling in a bucket next to a bowl of fresh fruit and canapes and wished us a wonderful stay. That was just the beginning of four days of tender loving care at the hands of the hotel's staff. It is the most subperbly run hotel I've ever stayed in and both my husband and I are world travellers who definitely like our comforts. There was a bottle of Hermes cologne and a bottle of Hermes eau d'toilette waiting for us in the bathroom, which was huge and did not house the toilette, which was in a separate room. There was a huge and beautifully designed dressing room/walk in closet with two gorgeous terry lined silk robes and beautiful slippers. The food was wonderful and did not disappoint. While it was our first time at Fouquet's, it will not be our last. This hotel owns me for life. Luxury is easy to find as it simply requires cash, but a warm and inviting hotel staff, especially in Paris is never a guarantee unless you stay at Fouquet's, where it is the norm.

Hotel Fouquet's Barriere is better than all of them. Sure, some of them have their high points (George V and their flowers) but this hotel just knocked me out with their service, attitude, graciousness, attention to detail and the physical property itself. I have stayed in many 5 star properties all over the world for the past 30 years. I have never received a questionnaire before my arrival asking me for my preferences. Did I want to be close or far from an elevator? Did I like my bed hard or soft? What kind and softness of pillows did I prefer? Would I like a savory, sweet or fruit upon my arrival? There were more questions, but the one that really knocked me out was \"Which do you prefer. Roses or Orchids? And what color?\" When I arrived into my room, my Red Roses were waiting for me, not a detail was out of place. (See Photo) Can you tell me of another Hotel in Paris that does this? So why is this Hotel only 316th out of all the Hotels in Paris? I do like the George V, don't get me wrong. But whenever I stay there I feel as though I have to put on a veneer of falseness to match the artificial attitude exuded by the staff. Not here. Everyone was VERY friendly and real. I was immediately made to feel relaxed and comfortable. I had a few travel-related problems that needed to be solved and the front desk staff, my butler and the concierge could not have been more accommodating. I wasn't made to feel as though I was a problem for them, but rather I think they really did enjoy helping me. My room faced the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es but had double doors between my room and street. It was silent. And what a treat to be able to go out on the little balcony and turn my head left to see the Arc de Triomphe. Very memorable. The bed was sumptuous. The sheets were like butter. I'm not someone to stay in bed in the morning, but it was hard to leave this bed. The room was very luxurious but not in a 19th Century French way. It was modern and yet warm and intimate with beautiful colors and fabrics throughout the room. I was not able to dine in any of their restaurants, just room service. But this was superb and very well presented. The Continental Breakfast was so beautifully presented, I took a picture and sent it back to my partner in California. (Included) In conclusion, the only thing I can think of is that the Hotel Fouquet's Barriere's ranking will move up as it becomes better known. It opened in 2006 and it takes a while for people to find you. I'm sure that after a few years, The George V will feel them giving them a run for their money. And then they too will send you a welcoming questionnaire to make you feel as at home as The Hotel Fouquet's Barriere did for my stay.", "Date": "February 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester UK", "Title": "\u201cWorth the 10month wait!!\u201d", "Author": "dezzieB", "ReviewID": "UR22467902", "Content": "I first booked this hotel for my wife and i to celebrate our first anniversary in January. Unfortunately when we arrived we were greeted by the operations director who informed us there was no room as a previous guest had extended their stay. We were naturally disappointed but have to say the way the situation was handled we couldnt of asked for more under their difficult circumstances. We were put up at fouqets expense in the Hilton where there was champagne constantly put in our room. We had booked a meal in Le Fouqets restaurant for the night of our anniversary and we were still invited to attend that. When we arrived we were taken to the more upmarket Le Diane restaurant which was a truly marvelous dining experience. Despite having a the usuall bottle of decent wine and an expensive brandy to finish there was no charge from the hotel for either the food or drink a saving of around \u00a3450 and the service was exemplary. We were told at the time we could return for free in the future for our intended two night stay. What started out as a disappointment was seeming a fortunate misfortune! We had enjoyed a free weekend in a good hotel and still had the promise of returning to experience what we had booked for free in the future. We took up this opportunity late november without any problem whatsoever. Upon arriving we were made to feel very welcome by staff who spoke excellent English without making you feel guilty for using your own language. ( i can speak french but struggle to understand it) We were taken to our room which had been upgraded to an executive room on the top floor overlooking the champs elysees. The room was immaculate and hi tec with a huge bed surround sound touch button lighting and a fantastic shower and bathroom. The full size french windows across the width of the room were totally sound proof whilst providing an excellent view of the bustle on the champs elysees. Again there was complimentary champagne waiting. We like to be left alone when away and although you are assigned a private butler we never found the need to trouble him/her and were pleased we were never disturbed either. The spa in this hotel is excellent and again friendly english speaking staff make you feel very welcome. The treatments we had were excellent in superb surroundings. We had our meal in Le Fouqets this time and this also was excellent with very professional yet friendly service and again in english without embarrasment. In fact one of the humorous points was when my wife said she didnt want a desert and our french waiter said \"your kidding me\" as if he had lived in england all his life! In all this hotel is high class well maintained and fashioned with professional friendly and discreet staff. The bar area is excellent with perfect service. Yes it is pricy but not over priced in my opinion for the quality of hotel and service that you enjoy. I would reccomend this hotel to anyone and we will return in the future even though next time we will be paying for the room as well as the extras!!

I bought a package from Luxury Link, but was a bit fearful after reading some reviews on this site. We had a very pleasant time., My review is a bit mixed. Positives: The room was spacious and very nicely appointed. Looked out on the corner of George V and Champs Elysees, which was nicley decorated for Christmas. Great sound insulation too..barely any outside noise in the room despite the very busy corner. The staff was very nice. I didn't get the anti-American vibe that some described, and I'm about as American as they come. (I speak almost no French at all and butcher the pronunciation when I try.) The location is great. Walking distance to many places, steps from George V metro that will take you anywhere else. Indoor pool and spa facilities were nice, though the fitness center lacked for equipment a bit....I think this is a problem everywere in Europe. I love a good gym and seek it out when I travel....You just have to accept that you won't find it at a European hotel. Negatives: Service is a bit spotty at times. It isn't up to the standards of the Four Seasons down the street, which, based upon the prices they are charging, is their direct competition. Our mini bar and glasses were not replenished on a couple of days. And once I asked to have a couple of champagne glasses sent to the room, the acted a little put off that I wanted \"two glasses of champagne without the glasses.\" (maybe a language issue?). When we checked in, our room wasn't yet ready, but they forgot to come get us from the bar when it was. Maybe this will improve over time as the staff gets more experience, but I think the general manager needs to really demand more from his staff and instill much higher standards. Spa is in the same area as the pool. This meant that during a massage, the sound of kids screaming in the pool was quite audible.. Not very relaxing and that won't make them a spa destination. They need to figure out something here. Also, the men's steam room was out of commission during the stay... :( Restaurant: We had a dinner included in our package. Thank God it was included. While the food was good (not great), the prices were shocking, even by Paris standards. Appetizers in the 50-80 euro range, and entrees from 60-120 euro.
