If you are lost in the maze of (supposedly) centrally-located hotels in Rome, don't hesitate to take a chance with Hotel Navona - or its sister hotel Residenza Zanardelli - you will not be disappointed. My Mother and I were looking for the perfect place to stay for our week in Rome so that we could walk to the main sites. The hotel is steps away from Piazza Navona and the Pantheon, and a short walk to the Trevi fountain, Spanish steps, the Colloseum and the Vatican. From the moment we arrived, Mike at reception welcomed us with a map and helped us plan our days to avoid the often lengthy line-ups at the Vatican and Colloseum. It was not long before we ran into Corri - the Italian-Australian owner who has lived all over the world and who has chosen to open his city to fellow travellers with style, grace and warmth. He and his sister are always around to make sure that everything is running smoothly - and that there are fresh flowers in every nook. The breakfasts are generous and tasty, with capucchino coffee making a great start to what are usually long walking days in Rome. The rooms are clean, comfortable and tastefully decorated, with ample warm water and incredibly comfortable mattresses. The hotel was recommended by friends at the Embassy of Brazil (which is just around the corner from the hotel on the Piazza Navona) - and caters to a m\u00e9lange of visitors from around the globe - both tourists and official delegates to the United Nations. Corri and his family, Mike and the staff go out of their way to make you feel at home and do whatever they can to help you get to know one of the world's greatest cities. Many of the staff we met each day have been with the hotel for several years - and their dedication shows. It creates a warm and hospitable atmosphere in a city that has become so crowded with demanding tourists. There are several typical restaurants close to the hotel and just off the Piazza Navona - Corri guided us to our favourites: Ristorante La Piccola Cuccagna - where we ate yummy funghi porcini and fried artichokes and Ristorante L\u00d3rso '80 with the full range of Roman dishes.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pa.", "Title": "\u201cMy Navona\u201d", "Author": "Penzgirl", "ReviewID": "UR119917467", "Content": "If you're familiar with European two-stars, you'll know what to expect here.

We found the hotel reasonably good value for money. Our room was very clean and quiet if slightly basic. Reception staff were okay but the attitude of the kitchen/dining room staff was rude and arrogant. The pictures on the internet show the breakfast room set up as individual tables for two or four people. Sadly this was not our experience. We were told breakfast was from 7.30-9.30 but when we appeared for breakfast on our first morning at 8.00 the place was a shambles. The hotel obviously caters for groups and they take preference over individual guests. The dining room was packed - the tables had been pushed together to accommodate maximum amount of people. We spotted a smaller room apparently set up for breakfast with no one there and assumed this was for non-group people. Wrong - we were rudely ordered out of there and into the main breakfast room by a very arrogant member of the kitchen staff. We explained there was nowhere to sit down there, however he shoved us in the middle of a table between four members of the group. We pointed out that we were not part of this group but he either didn't understand or didn't care. The latter we suspect. We were not offered any coffee or tea and the buffet table had been more or less cleared by the party. There was plenty of bread rolls and yoghurt but there was one rather sad half peach left and two slices of cheese, the ham had all gone. Nothing was replenished whilst we sat at the table. We never did find out who or what the other room was for and it remained empty throughout our stay! We complained at reception and were told that individual guests were encouraged to come to breakfast from 9.00 as they liked to clear the parties first! Useless if you have a pre-booking at a museum, as we had on that day, or indeed a train to catch. However next morning we went down at 9.10 - we were the only people there at that point, but some others came in about 10 minutes later to the obvious irritation of the staff. We were almost made to feel we had arrived late for breakfast and were now in the way as they bustled about clearing up around us. Our last morning we appeared at 8.50 and were met with the chaos of the first day, so altogether a no-win situation on the breakfast front. If you like a leisurely start to the day, this is not the place for you. When we were leaving the kitchen staff were having a very loud altercration with the guy in reception. We would probably not stay there again unless they sorted out their kitchen staff and eating arrangements, which is a pity really because the hotel itself is well situated and decent value for money.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFriendly, welcoming, clean hotel in a fantastic location\u201d", "Author": "17Carla", "ReviewID": "UR119446037", "Content": "We booked this hotel for a family of 9 hoping that it would live up to previous positive comments on tripadvisor.

I first saw Hotel Navona when a friend stayed here in 2002 and was so impressed with the cordiality of the owners, from that moment on, it's a top Rome choice for this budget category (and even beyond). I stay in other hotels in Rome, too, but love the Roman-ness of Navona and the owner family, very present. The owners have a broad knowledge of the city and are well traveled themselves, but above all it's their charm and humanity that always brings me back. Touches I love: antiques in guest room, good reading light, comfortable room temperature (even in sudden seasonal weather changes), great water pressure in the showers, a desk (or antique table) where I can work, comfortable beds. Room size matters less to me than location. I am in my room very little, and want to get out and about as much as on foot as possible, also to be in a safe, historic, and vibrant neighborhood. TV is of less interest, but they have plasma, with CNN. I prefer my news sitting with a newspaper at a Rome cafe, or when I need something more timely, do a quick internet check on my computer in the hotel. As for entertainment, nothing I see on TV beats the streets of Rome. Luggage: From the US a carry-on is all I need. (If you don't want to travel light to Rome, wait 'til you visit Venice!) Reception is up a flight of stairs on the first floor (our second floor) and some rooms are above that. No elevator, but very historic. (Travelers with disabilities would prefer their Zanardelli location, elevator plus more spacious rooms.) Where else at breakfast will I see patches of walls from the Baths of Agrippa? That's 1st century AD, and that's part of why I am in Rome! Communication: cell phone signals can be difficult in these Renaissance palazzos, so I leave my phone near the window. Wi-fi is available in various spots in the hotel. Plus a loaner laptop for brief e-mail checks. Noise: Wherever I am, I love a window view of the street, to see and hear the local movement, and yes, that includes noise, which fortunately does not bother me. The noise-sensitive traveler might prefer a courtyard room. Breakfast: Uh, being on the Continent, the classic European breakfast is, well, continental! The variation that I enjoy here is the fresh rosetta roll that says \"you're back in Rome.\" The banquet arrangement of tables is intimate (ie no secrets here). Servers always are cordial and efficient. Then I skip coffee here so I can dash out to Sant'Eustachio or some other great bar, see what the Romans are up to, and have my cappuccino there. Late morning in another bar, I get a fresh-squeezed juice (spremuta). To me, in Rome, that' s breakfast. Missed fruit or ham at breakfast? Go to Campo de' Fiori, stroll the morning market, buy fruit, and get a slice of pizza-- that will be memorable. Sights I walk to from here: Pantheon, Roman Forum, Coliseum, Piazza di Spagna/Spanish Steps, Capitoline, Vatican Museums, St. Peter's, Castel Sant'Angelo, etc. Amenities: Sure, I like those designers soaps, shampoos, buffet breakfasts with exotic fruits and Champagne, fluffy bathrobes, and all of those amenities that spoil us silly (hey, I even miss Leona Helmsley!). The reality check is that this is a budget hotel! And I am staying exactly in the part of the city that I want to be. Staff: Michele aka Mike is a wizard! He got me out of a big jam with my computer, which he sent off and was returned, all data intact. On another trip, when I had checked out and into another hotel, guests at Navona wanted to have dinner. Mike phoned, advised me, we hooked up and all had a splendid evening. They intuitively see what guests have interests in common, and make introductions (though never intrusive of privacy). I've met wonderful people, from an Australian UN relief worker on a break from disasters in Asia, to Delta Airlines staff, to artists on quirky projects, students, art professors, Brazilian architects.

Also, I\u2019m not talking about fire crackers and new year\u2019s eve celebration noise: they were sounds we enjoyed. Breakfast was useless. We gave up and went to a caf\u00e9. The breakfast room was lovely and the staff attentive but unfortunately the coffee was undrinkable, the orange juice tasted like undiluted cordial and the croissants were packaged. Horrible. I couldn\u2019t eat them. Their bread rolls were good if that\u2019s all you want for breakfast. For roughly the same price, you can stay at Casa Navona in an equally good location at the top end of Navona in far superior accommodation in a lovely apartment. We stayed there at the beginning of December for 125 Euro. The price for new year\u2019s eve was 200 Euro but unfortunately we couldn\u2019t book the apartment. I didn\u2019t enjoy my stay at Hotel Navona and if I\u2019d known what it was like, I\u2019d have booked somewhere else.

The hotel staff recommended a restaurant near the Pantheon-dai 3 Amici-which had good food and was very reasonably priced.

It is in a quiet back street and we had no noise nuisance at all (other than the cleaning staff cleaning next door). Although we arrived early we were given a vacant room by helpful reception staff. The room had character with wooden beams, a minstrals gallery (curtained off to hide cleaning and laundry products!) and small tv with Italian channels and CNN. The bed turned out to be very comfortable. No tea or coffee making facilities which is a shame. Unfortunately the broom cupboard which contained the \"bathroom\" was very poor. A small sink wedged in next to the small shower with a badly limed up shower head and a toilet. I could not stretch my arms out in any direction fully! The breakfast was dreadful. Orange juice in a plastic cup, a pot of tea or coffe, a yogurt, bread rolls or croissants in cellephane. We asked for a plate for our bread and were given a flimsy plastic one. This was a real shame.

If you stay here, you can walk anywhere to see the main sights of Rome (unless you also want to see the catacombs, which I recommend...) There are plenty of good and inexpensive restaurants (around Piazza Navona you'll find the good and expensive ones) close to the hotel. If you are staying in Rome for a shorter period of time, you don't want to waste time on unnecessary transportation.

The breakfast is good by Rome standards, but if you're expecting eggs & bacon, you won't find it. I had yogurt, OJ, hot tea and a roll and found it was enough to keep me until lunch. One thing to be prepared for about this hotel is that you have to go up two flights of stairs just to get to the front desk. If you have a lot of luggage, this could be hard. Also, it can be a little noisy outside, especially if you're trying to nap in the middle of the day. At night, it wasn't as noisy.

They promised a 10 euro/night discount for cash but then wanted the entire bill paid upon check-in, saying it was a discount only available the day of check-in. We refused and still did get the discount, probably due to the fact that a different person was on the desk at check-out. They ordered us a taxi for the airport and told us the price was fixed at 45 euros. Our driver charged us 55 (plus dropped us at the wrong terminal), and when I emailed them to let them know he was overcharging, they claimed it was not there responsibility.

It's a short walk from many sites and a nice, longer walk from the rest. I most enjoy walking Rome because then you get to see so much of the city that most tourists miss. Every time we walked to or from Hotel Navona, we stumbled upon some amazing stores, businesses, alleys and buildings that were so charming, picturesque and off the beaten path. This was my third trip to Rome in a year and my second stay at Hotel Navona. On my first trip I stayed at the Marriott Grand Flora on Via Veneto, which I didn't enjoy as much as Hotel Navona because of its inconvenient location and lackluster accommodations (for the price). I must say the reason I returned to Hotel Navona and will continue to do so is not only the location but its staff. The hotel owner walked us down the street and bought us coffee every morning and when I asked him about his other property (Residenza Zanardelli), he walked us over and gave us a tour himself. The front desk staff is always wonderful and helps us carry our bags, gives us great recommendations for restaurants, makes reservations and calls immediately for transportation. The rooms are very comparable to what you'll see all over Europe (except with far better and more reliable heating and air than anywhere else I've stayed!). Are the rooms up to US standards? No, but then you're not in the US! I think some of these reviews are why Americans have a reputation overseas of being \"spoiled\" (and we all suffer the consequences of this stereotype). Space is limited in Europe, therefore the rooms will be smaller just about everywhere you go on the continent. Beds aren't state-of-the-art sleep number beds, linens aren't 1,000 thread count and you won't find strawberries and champagne awaiting your arrival but Hotel Navona is clean, comfortable and more than adequate for a good night's sleep, a hot shower and a tasty breakfast. Hopefully in Rome that's all you'll need out of a hotel anyway. Please give Hotel Navona a try with adjusted expectations and a smile on your face. Maybe you too will get coffee every morning with the welcoming owner of this quaint hotel.

This is the first time I feel like I stayed at a totally different hotel from many of the other reviewers. There were not many \"Candid Traveler Photos\" for this hotel. To give a more realistic view of Hotel Navona...I've posted as many pictures as possible and hope this helps other travelers. If you have ever tried to find an apartment in NYC on a budget...you can relate to Hotel Navona. In NYC...sometimes you put your money into location and sometimes you put it into the actual space and look of the apartment you want to rent. In the case of Hotel Navona...all of your money is going into location. The hotel is one small block off of Piazza Navona. It is a 7-8 minute walk to the Pantheon. It is a 20 minute walk to the Forum. It is a $6.80 Euro cab ride to the Vatican Museum. It is a $8 Euro cab ride to the Colosseum. There are many restaurants on the opposite side of Piazza Navona that are very good and less touristy than eating in the Piazza itself. The location is obviously extremely central and very convenient. As others have mentioned, the hotel lobby is up two flights of stairs. If you are traveling alone...this can be a problem. I tried to call up to the front desk and no one answered. Fortunately, a gentleman staying in another part of the building came along and helped me. Wherever he is...THANK YOU! :) They originally put me in a room that was in the hallway just off the front desk. The double (two twin beds together) filled the entire room. There was less than a foot of space around the bed. I was also concerned with the noise of every hotel guest walking by my room. They moved me two more flights up to 15B. As you can see from the pictures---this room on the third floor was VERY small. The furniture was crammed in the room. The closet door couldn't open because of the bed. There was no counter space in the bathroom, etc. I recommend moving the furniture around to make it work for you. There was also some random wire hanging from the ceiling which made me a little nervous in such an old building. The bed is really a cot (see picture) and the linens are clean, but itchy and uncomfortable. The towels are clean and plentiful. The TV didn't work the first day, but they fixed it on the second day. There are three English speaking channels (MTV, CNN and another random channel that sometimes showed English speaking movies.) It is a very small TV and high up on the wall. There are no telephones in the room. At first this seems fine because everyone has a cell phone these days. You notice the missing phone when you want to call the front desk...and can't. Instead, you walk down and back up two flights of stairs. The front desk also has limited hours, but you can buzz them if you need something. The bathroom is as small as you would expect. I'm short and I found the shower troublesome. I can't imagine someone taller using it. If you have ever used a \"Boat Shower\"...that would be comparable. The bathroom amenities include two small bars of soap and a package of shampoo that doubles as bath gel. The best part of the room is the towel warmer and blow dryer in the bathroom. They both worked great. The water pressure was also very good. The closet had some hangers that others had left behind. To be on the safe side...bring your own. There is a small safe in the closet. It is not big enough to accommodate a laptop. The safe is free of charge. They do not have irons or ironing boards in the hotel because of fire safety. As other have mentioned and I will confirm---the walls are quite thin. There weren't many guests when I was there so I was OK...but I can imagine at the height of the season it is quite noisy. I looked in on the breakfast room and it was fine. They did have the \"croissants in plastic bags\" that others have mentioned. It does seem like an odd choice in an area with so many nice bakeries. Because of the location...there are plenty of places to get a quick coffee and pastry. I don't know that the free breakfast is even necessary. The staff does speak English and some are very friendly. Other staff members are simply accommodating...which is fine. The car service they recommended for transfer to the airport was fantastic! I was leaving very early in the morning and was nervous about leaving when the front desk was closed. They said I could ring the buzzer if the driver didn't show up...but all that would have made me late for my flight. However, the driver was 5 minutes early. The car was new and clean. The driver was incredibly nice. He went into the terminal building before letting me out...just to confirm he was dropping me in the correct spot. I was picked up at 5:30AM which is still considered the nigh rate and the cost was $60 Euros ($50 Euros during the day). I've thought a lot about this review and I don't know whether to say I would recommend this hotel or not. I personally would not stay there again and would not recommend it to close friends. I understand that hotels are costly in Rome, but this hotel was just not good enough to justify staying in the location. The next time I would try to find nicer hotel in an area I liked or budget to spend more on my Rome hotel. This is just a personal preference.

We stayed here on the recommendation of friends, who were very pleased with its central location. From Hotel Navona we could also walk to the Forum and Colosseum and in the opposite direction, to the Vatican (although with all there is to see at the Vatican, I'd recommend saving your feet and taking the bus!) Bus No 64 was the one we took to get to the hotel, as it connects Temini to the Vatican, with the stop at St Andrea della Valle very close to the hotel. You'll have to walk up Corso del Rinascimento about 50m and then take a right into Via dei Sediari to find it. It would be easy to miss it, since the street is very narrow, but we had been given directions in the e-mail we received from the hotel, and we found it without any bother. First impressions might be off-putting. Step off the street into the litte yard (others have called it a courtyard, but that's a bit complimentary!) Reception is up two fligts of stairs. If you are not alone, I'd advise one of you stay downstairs with the bags, as it could happen that they assign you a room across the yard, in which case you have to carry your bags back down the stairs and up another steep stairs to get to the rooms on the other side. In fairness there was a porter who would have carried the bag, but my husband was happy to do it. As others have said, the rooms are pretty basic, but I would have to add that they are spotless! I was really happy with the level of cleanliness. The shower was small but had a good flow of water and plenty hot too. There was as hair-dryer. In the wardrobe we found a safe, which was easy to operate. There was also a mini fridge which we stocked with fruit & drinks that we bought in the Spar on Via Plebiscito about 100m away. We were also glad of the heater which we could plug in or not as we wished (it rained for the two days we spent in Rome). The bed was comfortable with very clean fresh white linen. However, it is as well to point out that our \"double\" bed was actually two singles pushed together and covered with a wide sheet! We managed fine, but this might be a factor to be considered when booking. Our room overlooked the narrow street and we had two french windows. The windows had a nifty mechanism that worked like a blind to completely block out the light, so we could sleep on in the morning if we wanted to. We skipped breakfast the first day, as other reviewers said it wasn't up to much, but we partook on the second morning. Interesting dining room! Everybody more or less shares the tables as there is very little room between them, and they run along two walls of a very narrow dining room. A good opportunity to chat and compare stories and experiences with fellow tavellers - we are all here for the same reason, no? Breakfast consisted of pastries/croissants and a bread roll with butter & jam. The pots of coffee and tea were very generous in size. There was also a glass of orange juice (concentrate). Overall, our experience was a very satisfactory one. We wanted a central location in a clean and safe environment, and we got that. Reception was efficient although not very friendly. (I found that Romans dealing with tourists, in general, were like that. Maybe they have had enough at the end of the long season?) There are two restaurants right beside the hotel, both of which looked good, but we ate elsewhere. There's a stylish bar (CO2) just around the corner (left & left again) and also an English pub, and a coctail bar/restaurant just beyond that. And I haven't even got as far as Piazza Navona !! You really are spoilt for choice with th location of this hotel. We paid \u20ac145 for the first night which we booked with credit card, and they offer a \u20ac10 reduction on the second night if you pay by cash.

The walls were paper thin and we could actually see light from the room next to us from a space where the wall did not meet the ceiling. We were able to hear the neighbor on one side of us every time she coughed and that was the side that had our bathroom separating the rooms. The room on the other side was more of a problem. Although in any other hotel it probably would not have been an issue, at the Navona the walls were so thin we were able to hear EVERY word of their conversations, EVERY time they used the bathroom as well as their nightly romantic adventures. Although their bathroom separated their room from ours, it was as though they were IN OUR room. I will say the location is great - close to many of the sites as well as great restraunts and right around the corner from a good coffee shop. The breakfast was ok - coffee, OJ, a large french roll and several types of cellophane wrapped cakey things that i would recommend avoiding.

The Hotel has always given me a warm welcome and they have become like family to me. I am quite surprised by the comments that some travellers have made of this family-run establishment. Being a family run business, complaints are taken personally, not as in a large hotel chain. I mention when things need to be fixed, exchanged or improved but in a polite manner. If you have an attitude that you are unhappy and everyone on either side of the reception desk should know it (we've all met travellors like that) then a small hotel (at a reasonable rate) in Italy (or most of Europe) is not for you. A traveller coming to Rome has to appreciate the high prices that hotels now command given that the Euro has more than doubled the cost of visiting the Eternal City. This sometimes makes it difficult to find a decent, well priced and safe place to stay, especially if you are a female travelling alone. Hotel Navona has provided me with this type of safe environment and this encouraged me to stay there alone or with my family. The rooms are clean, comfortable and the many renovations over the years now guarantee me windows with double-glazing that prevents the outside noise from coming in. The (very) light breakfast in the morning is welcoming but as some guests have written, if you want more than juice and a fresh bun, there are plenty of restaurants or bars within a few minutes walk that offer a greater variety.

The hotel manager came down to the cab to greet us and even helped me with my bag (there are many stairs and no elevators here). The room was clean and with the windows closed, extremely quiet. The room was not large, but perfect for the two of us, and we did not want to spend much time in our room anyway. We walked to the Pantheon, Colloseum, and charming Piazza Navona for a lovely dinner there. We also took the train everywhere else, which was great. The staff was quite helpful with calling cabs, providing us with hairdryer and also electric outlet converters. One surprise: it said they took travellers checks, but these must be in Euros. We had travellers checks in dollars and they would not accept this.

A Romantic Break. We were recommended this hotel from my boyfriends parents who stayed here at the begining of the year. We stayed in room 14 (I think) right at the top. It was a good size room. We had a nice double bed - altough is squeeked alot - which got on mine and my boyfriends nerves after a while. The bathroom was a nice size and the shower was fantastic! Clean towerls everyday and bed made everyday. Breakfast was nice, it was basic - orange juice in a plastic cup, strong coffee and some pasteries - which was nice enough. The reception was not 24hr, so you had to remember to take your key with you otherwise after 10pm you were locked out! The staff and hotel owners were very nice and gave you a free map and instructions on how to get places. Its a fantastic location for sighseeing. Piazza Navona is breathe- taking along with the Pantheon, which is 'just' around the corner, St Peter's and the Cupola is a MUST, although I would definatly recommend getting there before 9am, im glad we got up extra early otherwise the ques are massive. Castel Sant'Angelo is good fun to walk around and see. The Colosseum is a MUST too - that was amazing. The Roman Forum is wonderful, you can walk and walk and walk around this all day and see something new and amazing each time. For this I think you will need a whole day to do - I did the Colosseum & the Roman Forum in one day and I think it needs a good full day or maybe 2 days - but its a good walk from the hotel and on a hot day - it could be bit ott. The Trevi Fountain is just wonderful - but its very very busy at all times. I recommend going both day and night, first and last thing to see it in its full glory! Watch out for those people who try to sell you red roses and stuipid toys - they see you coming before you do and they WILL rip you off. Just say no, but after a while you do start to loose your temper with them, so thats why I recommed go there in the morning and late at night (but not too late!) We got ripped off - they put the roses in your hand and say \"gift, I give you gift\" so you think brillant and walk off with your \"gift\" and then they come after you with how many euro's this \"gift\" costs! Its easier to say no and walk on. We did find somewhere brillant to eat in Rome - its right by the Trevi Fountain. As you look at the Trevi its to the right of you, about 50 yards round the corner. I cant remember what it was called, but the menu had a chickens head as the logo - sounds odd - but the food was fantastic - we went there 2 nights in a row. We also had to go to the piazza navona for a coffee on the last day, expensive as it was it was nice to have a coffee and people watch. The buses are grate too - although very busy. Its something like 1 \u20ac for 45 mins on any bus. We brough tickets there and back from the bus station - although we never got checked, its always better to pay the 1 \u20ac than been fined or chucked off!

We stayed in a very low-ceilinged room that looked out into the always dark airshaft/courtyard with laundry, trash, and views into other people's apartments that some have mentioned. (Also as some have mentioned, the guidebook-touted courtyard and ancient fountain are not impressive or attractive.) The staff was somewhat unresponsive, but not impossible. For instance, when we went to Florence for a couple days, they kept our bulky luggage for us in the interim; they just kept us waiting a very long time while we waited to pay and check out. The absence of a television was not a problem for me, and while the breakfast was underwhelming, that wasn't a particular problem either, as there are wonderful cafes just outside, which would be preferable to even a wonderful hotel breakfast. On the plus side, the bathroom was a reasonable size, nicely decotated, with good hot water. And of course the major plus, and it is worth a great deal, is the absolute perfect, amazing location, which allows you to stumble into the Pantheon without even trying--a magical experience. Given this, and given that we stayed there in the off-season and back when the dollar was stronger, so the hotel was a good deal cheaper than it is today, I think it was worth the money. I wouldn't go back to it at current prices. I think, however, that one reason the reviews here are so negative is because there is an enormous gap between the impression given by the website photos (and by the fountain-touting guidebooks) and the reality of many or most of the rooms. My impression of the Hotel Navona would be much warmer if it had simply been upfront about the simple accommodations in its self-promotion. The website's pictures of high carved ceilings, elaborate curtains, and enormous windows, even if technically correct for the rooms pictured, are simply not representative enough to stand alone on the website, even with allowances made for the inevitable flattering shots in this context. I think people here would be less angry if they did not feel they had been lied to.

On our last night we paid \u00a350 more and stayed at the Mecenate Palace, staff were terrible but worth the \u00a350 extra", "Date": "June 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "respbill", "Title": "\u201cGreat Price , Great Location\u201d", "Author": "respbill", "ReviewID": "UR3440568", "Content": "The hotel is located in a great area, as we walked to Vacatican and up to Spanish Steps, Roman Ruins. All is there with many small streets with loads of places to eat and at all price ranges. The rooms were clean and bathrooms were exceptionally clean. Only negatives were the breakfast which is coffee and a roll but enough to get you going and staff can be distant. We were locked out one night as there is no central key given for the main area (hotel is located on third floor of large building) and ended up staying with our friend who lives in Rome that night, and we were not aware that we would not be able to get back into the hotel. If you want a good place to rest your head and not have to worry about taxis, buses, or underground, this is the place. We only took a taxi to and from the train station when we arrived and left. I would stay there again. Of course if you need American standards of large rooms and a full breakfast then this is not the place for you.", "Date": "May 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Annandale, VA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and price, forget friendliness with staff\u201d", "Author": "cubanica", "ReviewID": "UR3433169", "Content": "This is a very good option for staying in Rome.

The staff arent going to love you to death and the owner is a little too pleased with himself - but thats ok - because I didnt come to Rome to spend the day shooting the breeze with them. The breakfast, breakfast room and staff serving it, leave much to be desired and you wont be missing out if you dont have it ,and thats what I recommend you do, as there are plenty of nice places you can go to near the hotel for fresh coffee and bread. The hotel is in a great location and for \u20ac140 a night you are not going to get much better, so would all those who are looking for 5 star quality (based on the other reviews here) do everyone else a favour, unlock their wallets and pay $500 a night for a hotel where they'll get what they want. You wont get much in New York for $140 so why expect it elsewhere. I cant believe some of the negative reviews here. One even complains about audible noise when in the room during the day. What were they doing there during the day??? Another complains about insufficient room in the bathroom for two people - please!!!!!!! This is one of the great cities of the world - the hotel is in the centre of it - quit complaining, get out and see it. If you walk the legs off yourself during the day, like you should - you'll be too tired in the evening to care about the five star niceties that are missing in Hotel Navona.", "Date": "April 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cbad attitudes, nasty rooms\u201d", "Author": "Virginia_painter", "ReviewID": "UR3099821", "Content": "I spent a week in this hotel in the spring of 2004.
