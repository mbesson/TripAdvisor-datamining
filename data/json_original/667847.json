This was not my choice, but had been preselected by them for everyone to stay at, so we could all be in the same place. We walked in and immediately were met with swarms of teenagers, all drinking and being boisterous in the lobby. There was one staff member taking care of all the check ins so it made for a long line up. The rooms are used as dorms during the school year, so they are equipped with two desks. The room was run down, the beds were not adequately supported and we had to put a garbage bin under the one side of the bed to kept it flat. This place is like a hotel that has been run into the ground. Cigarette burns in the carpet, torn wallpaper etc. It looked like what you'd expect after 8 months of partying and no upkeep. I would stay here if I was going to Montreal to party with friends, not for any other purpose. If you're a group of teens- mid 20's looking to party, this is a perfect place. If you are looking for something better taken care of and want to sleep, then look somewhere else. The price may be right, but I looked on booking.com while we were there and I found way nicer hotels for the same price. Make the effort and find a better hotel. The location is good but not great.

Our room was not really clean, but at least our beds were clean and the sheets were white. We found some spit-ball stains on the ceiling and a huge stain on the ground. We basically just walked around our room in our outdoor shoes - which was fine I think. The bed side lamps won't work as it was not plugged in and the outlets were behind the bed. The washroom had hairs stuck on the walls - it was atrocious. But it at least had the basic amenities: two desks and chairs for each of us to use our laptops, and free wifi with a strong signal throughout the room. As our roommates, we had someone playing their guitar in the hallway at 11 pm - waiting with their luggage. I would had gave him a dollar if I had one! And around 5 pm in the afternoon, a guest were throwing up in the lobby washroom. They were certain interesting people! The hotel advertises parking under the hotel and can be reached via an elevator inside the hotel. While that was true, they did not advertise that you need to walk 5-10 minutes through two sets of elevators and through a plaza/food court before reaching your car. And parking was $19 per day. It's a closed lot, so it was relatively safe. The hotel also provided a $6 per person for breakfast (7-10am). For that amount, you could get a coffee, a toast, eggs and bacon or sausage. I think that was pretty average but we found out about the $6 credit after we took a bunch of stuff from their cafeteria. It's just like any university cafeteria where you grab your food and pay at cashier. We had to pay a bit on our first morning just because we didn't know about that. I guess in the end, we paid for what we got and the location was great so it even'd out. But I would pay a little bit more next time just to stay in an established hotel chain instead.

But, if you're going to have an active vacation, anticipate spending very little time in your hotel, and want very good accommodations, then McGill is for you. With easy access to the train, downtown, Mont Royal Parc, and the restaurants of St. Laurent, it was a real deal. (CAA and AAA members get an additional discount.) The rooms have large dorm-size refrigerators, which are convenient if you don't want to eat out all the time, and the NRC is conveniently located on the underground shop system.

The parking garage has no in and out priveleges so can be expensive. The room itself was perfectly adequate. We had 2 double beds, TV, 2 desks and a small fridge. All of the staff members were extremely helpful with our questions. The room price also includes a $6 credit for breakfast in their cafeteria which is more than adequate.

Easily walking distance to St. Laurent or a short cab ride to Saint Catherines street for amazing bistro dining and bars, with clubs hidden here and there. We only used a cab to and from the airport as there is no other easy access unless you want to drag your suitcases onto the bus. Rooms were nothing special. Ordinary curved glass TV, an empty fridge which was a bonus (there is a Provigo or \"Superstore\" just south of the hotel), and a so-so bed. But for the money, you can't beat it!

The New Residence Hall is within easy walk of all the major shops and the Metro. The Residence Hall is also connected to a neighbourhood mall with grocery stores, restaurants, bars, drug store and most of anything you would need. The room rate that I had also included a voucher towards breakfast in the Cafeteria. Depending on what you have this voucher will or could cover all the value of your breakfast. Lunch and dinner need to be outside the hall as the cafeteria is only open for breakfast. There are lots of neat bistros and restaurants in the area. When visiting Montreal I would recommend obtaining a OPUS card -- it is a rechargable card (like London's Oyster Card) It is good for travel on the Metro and bus system. Also if you are arriving in Montreal by air at Pierre Elliott Trudeau airport and do not want to take a taxi to town try the new 747 Express Bus.

That being said the cinderblock walls leave lots of little places for the bugs to hide out. Since it's hard to say if it's a BB bite for SURE without evidence all I can say was I was getting bites at night and they weren't mosquito bites. There were also smears of blood on the sheets which is another sign of bed bugs. Upon looking when I got home other McGill residences have confirmed bed bug cases including the most public case in MORE. Aside from the bugs, the rooms were alright. Price was good. Staff weren't informative but nice. Apparently I got free breakfast (up to $5 each day and wasn't told until the last day after it ended - nice). Lack of knowledge about airport shuttles which ended up in me not getting a pickup shuttle back. No wifi access unless you stay more that 14 nights but free use of computers between 7am and 10 pm.
