{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Shining Pearl Kasai I'm a young adult from Southern California and stayed at the Pearl Kasai for a week on vacation. It was great for everything we needed: friendly people, nice room, shuttle to and from Disneyland, it was great.It's in a great location too, lots of shops and experiences near by and if you want to expand your sightseeing, the hotel is only a five minute walk from the Tokyo Metro Subway station. One of the BEST public transportation systems I've ever seen. It can take you practically anywhere in Tokyo for cheap, including to and from the airport.I would highly recommend it for travelers on a budget, it was a great deal.", "Date": "Mar 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR594327994", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "flmcrw"}, {"Content": "Avoid at all costs Having lived in Japan for over two years and done a lot of travelling I know what to expect from a Japanese hotel and can honestly say overall this is the worst I have stayed in. On the plus side the linen and bathroom were spotless, however the rooms stunk, the walls were dirty with peeling paper and the carpets enough to make your toes curl!The front desk staff were neither welcoming nor helpful and although I can speak some Japanese they made no effort to speak English even when I was struggling to say what I wanted. I have stayed in far better hotels for a similar price in Shibuya and Akasaka and do not recommend this hotel at all.The Disneyland Shuttle bus was good.", "Date": "Oct 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR489308037", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "JIOkinawa"}, {"Content": "good value but ... I stayed in the Pearl Hotel Kasai for 2 weeks during Thanksgivingholidays and overall it was a pretty good experienceCONS: I asked for nonsmoking but they stuck me in a smoking room!!! The Expedia website did specifically mention that such a request wouldn't be guaranteed but still --- they should've tried harder to find a nonsmoking room since they made so much money off me. GRRR. Though in general very clean, I was disappointed to find a dark stain on the carpet and the chair was too dirty looking to sit on so I used it as a hanger.PROS: bed linen changed every day, bathroom cleaned every day, very nice  helpful front desk staff, walking distance to: subway station (5 minutes ), 100 Yen shop, McDonalds, KFC, 24 hour Udon restaurant (yummy), coin laundry ($6 per load with detergent included), supermarket and shopping mall (25 minutes) which was a cheap source of souvenirs and meals.Overall, I would stay in this hotel again ONLY if my nonsmokingpreference could be guaranteed during booking.", "Date": "Jan 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR607150971", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mister_krispy"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066445-d559388-r14223316-Kasai_Pearl_Hotel-Edogawa_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "559388", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
