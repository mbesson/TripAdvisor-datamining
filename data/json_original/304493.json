The food is okay, but the restaurant staff is EXCELLENT. Spent quite a bit of time at the internet cafe, and the ladies in there are superb too! We enjoyed the beach, the pool and especially the people watching on the\"walk\" here at JBR. The Marina mall is close by and loved going to Carluccios on the ground floor. Didn't know if we were going to like Dubai, but we were all pleasantly surprised! I highly recommend this hotel for families on holiday and business travel. I felt safe, and comfortable.

I've stayed in many Sheratons and you know you will never be let down. However, this trip didn't start very well with the Sheraton taking the full payment on my card a month in advance even though they don't ever even ask for a deposit and you can cancel up to 24hrs before arriving. I discovered this when my credit card statement arrived and contacted them immediately. Not only did they arrance an automatic refund they also paid the interest on my card and the difference in the exchange rates as well as upgrading my room and arranging free airport transfers. The hotel is next to the beach in Jumeirah, and our room had spectacular sea views with Atlantis in the distance. The hotel itself has a wonderful pool and gardens and private beach. Even though it is a fair taxi or metro ride to any of the malls or attractions it is well worth it to be next to the sea rather than just surrounded by skyscrapers, building works and construction which is everywhere. We were fortunate enough to have the Club facilities on the 9th floor which are well worth the extra providing a delicious breakfast in a much quieter location plus drinks and canapes in the evening which is a real treat before you go out to dinner. The Club Lounge also has wifi and computers for the guests' use. We didnt eat in any of the hotel restaurants even though there is a very good choice and all the menus looked delicious. We ate by the pool (excellent) and in the cafe one day, again, very good. The beds are by far the most comfortable of all hotels and the bathrooms are very well equiped with everything you could possibly need. The staff are fantastic in every way. Every request was speedily dealt with and the conceirge desk were brilliant at booking restaurants for us.

I'm a Starwood Platinum member and am usually very well treated at Dubai properties with perks and upgrades. From the get-go, there wasn't much recognition at check in and I didn't find the front desk crew very cordial. After a bit of wrangling, I managed to get a slight upgrade to a beach-facing room: lovely view, but the decor seemed rather dated. The lounge was well appointed and had a nice selection of offerings for breakfast, afternoon tea and happy hour. The best part of staying here, for me, was the ability to stroll down the beach to the Palm and also the proximity to the Walk, Marina and Metro, which are about a 10-minute walk from the hotel.

It is a solid four star hotel, however. Apparently, they do quite a bit of business through tour companies. There were lots of Russians and quite a few Swedes and Finns. At least TUI has this property sold through various \u201cpackage\u201d travel agencies in Europe. The hotel is located on the far end of the Jumeirah Beach Walk. This rather long street is full of restaurants and has some shops as well. On the other side of the road from the Sheraton is a Starbucks, which doesn\u2019t offer free wireless, and a Thai restaurant. Stayed at this property twice.Once in October and then again in December. Both times I received a Junior Suite based on the Starwood Preferred Guest Platinum status. These junior suites aren\u2019t the most modern ones. They are not bad by any means, but comparing to other hotels in the area, refurbishment is needed at some not so distant future. There is one pool on the property but the hotel, unlike some others, has direct beach access, so the sea is always nearby. There are plenty of chairs around the pool. Didn\u2019t go to the pool but used the pool bar couple of times. You can order adult beverages and some basic bar food as well. I wasn\u2019t overly satisfied with the pool bar, however. This was partly due to the constant noise from the nearby construction site. The Palm Garden looked wonderful. It was truly a garden like setting. One of the better fitness centers. When you sign in remember to request any towels that you might need. The locker room area doesn\u2019t have any. Supposedly there had been few taken as the fitness center is open for paid visits as well. They have headphones available if you want to watch TV while working on the cardio machines. Remember that in the United Arab Emirates you are supposed to wear a towel all the time when in the locker room and in the sauna.This is due to the local customs. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to stay here again if the price is right. If you are looking for the most modern hotel and a great pool area, this hotel isn\u2019t probably for you.

That side of the hotel is obscured by an enormous residential/hotel development that towers over the Sheraton. The Southern (land side) is notable for the Jumeriah Beach Residence Towers that block any view to the marina... it is a sheer wall of yellow brown stone & glass! At least the gardens have a pleasant view over the beach and the sea, with the Palm Jumeriah in the the distance. The beach road approaching the hotel can be a 'car park' on weekends and holidays just as the sun setting so allow plenty of time to arrive if you intend to there an hour before sunset. After sunset the JBR area seems to erupt into party mode with load music and cars blaring out stereos from open windows....not very relaxing at all! The hotel made an early appearance on the shore as such it shows its age compared to the more glamorous properties down the beach. As an SPG member I was hoping for a nice break with my wife in the hotel using up a voucher, and I upgraded our room on a cheap offer to a sea-facing room. However on check in the supervisor offered us an 'upgrade' by providing me with a sea facing room. When i pointed out to him that I had paid for the same, he said that the reservation did not reflect this. Although I was able to show him that I had a confirmation sent to me on a smart phone reflecting this, he insisted that I get a print out of the same to show his manager! When asked if I did this what would be the result be he said he could not tell me until the Manager had reviewed it. Although he promised faithfully to get the manager back to me in a reasonable time to tell what the hotel what do on this I never heard from his supervisor which is very disappointing. All credit to the check in member who said he would allow me to use the Towers lounge for refreshments and snacks in the evening in the meantime. However we felt that experience of a quiet night away was spoiled by the Hotels intransigence in not responding to their problems in the reservations system. The management need to to allow check-in staff more responsibility to respond to its guests concerns,especially if they belong to the SPG programme.

Worth to pay a little extra and book a Sea view. Yes there is a new tower block going up next door but this is happening everywhere in Dubai so not the hotels fault and you soon don't notice. Free internet in the 24hr lobby cafe. 4 computers available and can pick up free 45mins codes for the computers and also for wireless.

Lots of cheap Eats along The Walk which is a good option for lunch. We had a cake left in the room for our Anniversary so a nice touch and ice Machine on the floor - also much appreciated. Metro about 15/20 mins walk and suggest to buy the silver top up card if planning to use a few times. Fabulous, great toilets, Spotless, busy, safe and trains running between every 3 to 10mins. The Dubai Marina area is great and suggest to book on the 1.5hr Yellow Boat, Palm Jumeirah, Burg Al Arab and Marina Tour http://theyellowboats.com/ - great fun and some great photos.

I called the next day and made a kind notice to the manager, informing him that its these small things that can ruin the image of a fine hotel. He agreed and sent up another OLD scratched iron. Pathetic. They left fruit and a bottle of wine (I don't drink) the next day to make up for my ruined pants. Additionally, there was a lot of shadiness. There were obvious escorts coming in and out with men at all times of the day and night. I felt like I would be mistaken for one when I'd come down to the lobby to use the internet at 2 am.

Two criticisms to get out of the way quickly - yes there is buidling work going on next door but you don't hear or see it most of the time. In fact I was only aware of it because I looked following the reviews on here ! Don't worry, it is not at all intrusive. Second - try to avoid the buffet dinner on Thursday night when the belly dancer is in. She's great but the music is just so loud and intrusive you'll want to go outside to listen to the sound of the construction work !! I have no idea why they have this in the middle of the restaurant - it's a real shame as so few people are listening or getting involved. Now the positives - and there are many ! Great staff - particular mention to the Maitre d' in the restaurant, Brian. He is just so helpful, friendly, attentive, professional - a real gem. He was fantastic and seemed to be there 24x7. I hope the hotel recognise him in some way as he is so good. The other is Hari at the pool bar - cool dude or what ? Very chatty and always around when it got too hot. He just seemed to know when we were in need of water, a beer or a cold towel. Great guy and good fun - his name is Hari but everyone, including his bosses know him as Harry - cool shades Hari !! The rooms are very comfortable, clean and tidy. We were treated like royalty for the week and really enjoyed it. The location with a choice of either poolside, garden or private beach is fantastic although I would like to ask the hotel to have some ice shipped in to the sea please - it's very warm !! There is a great selection of shops and restaurants along the seafront or promenade - everything from the ubiquitous Starbucks to some very upmarket dineries. We tried Frankies ( Frankie Detorri and Marco Pierre White's joint venture ) which was fabulous although somewhat interesting as a blazing row between the Maitre d' and Sommelier erupted in the middle of service - very unprofessional but very entertaining ! I would highly recommend this hotel - it's not big and glitzy like some of the other so called 7 star establishments. If you want 1500+ bedrooms and impersonal service don't stay here.

The pool is reasonably sized and has a pool bar and there are a range of options for sunbathing spots, including a nice garden and private beach. If you have a sea view room, the Jumeira palm looks amazing at night with the Atlantis all lit up. The metro station is around a 15 minute walk and taxis are pretty cheap.

There is also a free shuttle to the 'Mall of the Emirates' where you can shop, catch the metro or visit Ski Dubai. You MUST dine at the Ciao Ristorante.

On arrival at 08.30 we were told that we would have to wait for the room till 11.30 (usual check in time is 3pm!) We were upgraded automatically to a Tower Suite on the 8th floor. When we got the room at 12pm,\u00a0we left our luggage in the store area and we were told we could use all the recreational facilities until the room was ready. The lobby is large with plenty of seating available.\u00a0 It was my wife's 30th Birthday and out wedding anniversary. Housekeeping bought us two luxury chocolate mousse cakes with a fresh fruit basket to our room! We were spoilt! What a fantastic surprise and very thoughtful of them!\u00a0 The room was huge, with separate dining area, lounge, super kingsize bed , very spacious bathroom equipped with designer toiletries, 40in plus tv with DVD player, mini bar, safe and complimentary water! amongst other amenities. Our room was cleaned daily and offered views of the JBR. Do go to the 8th floor tower lounge which has breathtaking views of the Arabian sea and good views of the pool areas. The hotel is in a great location within the JBR area with an array of up market restaurants, cafes, and shops. There is an Almaya supermarket across the JBR which is convenient to stock up on groceries as prices in the hotel are inflated. The beach is clean, with superb views looking onto the palm island. There are plenty of sun loungers for everyone to use with bar staff waiting to take drinks orders. Sea was very warm and not over crowded. Hotel offers variety of water sports. It is beginning to get extremely hot now approaching summer season. Remember to apply lots of sun screen!\u00a0 \u00a0The hotel is a 5min drive from the Jumeirah Lake Towers metro station by taxi which costs 10 dhirams. It's only about 15-20mins walk away but it was very hot approx 36deg in the sweltering dry heat, therefore transport is best. The metro costs 11dhirams to get into downtown Dubai and takes approximately 30mins. Breakfast at the hotel was faultless everything you can imagine with exceptionally friendly staff. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and couldn't do enough for you. There are 3 restaurants in the hotel and an outside alfresco \u00a0eatery with pub style food with patio furniture, music and large projector screen. There is also an Arabian sheesha bar which was always packed with people during the evenings. The gym is a good size, there is a squash court, sauna and steam room. The swimming pools with swim up bar were very clean but very busy during the day time. Difficult to get a sun lounger poolside. The hotel grounds are pristine clean, sea facing with vast amounts of sun lounges on the lawn area, offering plenty of shade amongst the palm trees. Downside there is no Jacuzzi and the steam and sauna were not turned on. You had to inform the staff at the health club reception that you wanted to use it so they could switch it on. Very inconvenient.\u00a0 It was very disappointing that 5star hotels do not offer shuttles to the airport. A taxi will cost around 70dhirams and take 25mins off peak times. Expect 40mins during peak times. The concierges will try to book you a private taxi to airport. Do not use them as they are twice the price. Beware there is a large construction project beside the hotel working away 24/7. Not a good site to see. Noisy at times but this then becomes background noise.\u00a0 The hotel has a gift shop, jewellery shop, sports shop besides having a beauty salon offering variety of massages and treatments that are over priced. Do not get a taxi through the concierge as the prices are hiked up. Get a cab from the JBR beside the hotel entrance where they are priced by meter.

We even scouted the hotel before hand! The building work next to the hotel will go on for a little while yet an although a slight irritation it blends in after a while. The hotel is a good standard and only suffers from comparison to the slightly newer more over the top hotels such as Atlantis or Jumeriah Beach. The concierge staff were very helpful and polite. The buffet breakfast had a wide choice and although busy most days it was possible to find space. The hotel grounds are big enough to cope with the hotel size and all in all it is a relaxed and comfortable hotel. As you would expect drinks are expensive as is pool side food but you should know that anyway if you are staying in such a hotel so don't be suprised. The private beach is a bonus. The downside is that it is at the furthest end of The Walk from everything else so don't get a taxi to take you that route unless you have a large bank balance. The hotel is near to a number of resturants with a wide range of pricing, styles and food, so it's a matter of taste and budget. We also visited Atlantis & Wild Wadi water parks - the latter being slightly better if you only want to go to one. Take time to go on the desert safari - the morning is better (which we did) apparently as there are less vehicles around at the time - although you don't get the dinner and evening show. Visit the Burj Kalifa in the evening to see the musical fountains (like Bellagio in Vegas). For cheap shopping don't go to the main malls get a taxi to Karama and enjoy bargaining but don't always expect significant quality.

We stayed 8 nights in the hotel. It's not ultra modern and in a sense all the better for that - everything works (except the key cards which had to be reset half-a-dozen times for each room) We arrived at 1:00 am to find out that our allocated rooms were on separate floors. As the hotel was full that night we were promised that we would be changed to the same floor the next day - and this was done with no fuss at all. Full marks for delivering on the promise. Overall service was excellent thoughout our stay. We had half-board which was ideal as we could choose between lunch or dinner depending on what we were doing that day. All meals were served in the main restaurant, with an excellent buffet breakfast and a good variety of buffet meals at both lunchtime and evening. Food was not Michelin starred quality but very acceptable - particularly the starters/salad bar. The rooms were comfortable with full amenities including complimentary daily replenished bottles of water. We didn't have a balcony (can't complain as we hadn't paid for it) but the view over the ocean was spectacular. A negative is that the hotel does not have free wi-fi in the rooms, although it did have free wi-fi in the public areas with four computers available for use (sensibly limited to a maximum of 45 minutes a session). The pool was of a good size, but at very busy times we found that the pool and surrounding areas could be very crowded. The grounds are well laid out and in particular there is a lovely lawned area between the swimming pool and beach which has large palm trees providing shelter. This is ideal for reading a book or just relaxing. However, be aware that you may find the noise from the adjacent building site somewhat intrusive. It did disappear into the background noise after a few minutes, but some people may be disturbed. In this case, wait a couple of years before visiting when the building work is completed. The location at the end of JBR Walk is a bit of a pain if taking taxis back to the hotel as all of Dubai seems to be out driving at a snails pace in their prestige cars, which makes the last mile a real crawl. The hotel is also some 25 KMs from downtown Dubai, so if easy access to Dubai is important to you this may not be the right location. Access to the Emirates Mall and the Burj Khalifa is very good though. The only really discordant note is the hotel promoting their own (more expensive, even if metered) luxury limousines instead of regular taxis. We made this mistake once, and after that just walked a few extra yards to the Walk and found a regular taxi. Overall we were very satisfied with the hotel. If we could we would have given the hotel 4 1/2 out of 5, missing out on the five rating because of the building works.

First impressions: The hotel looks a bit outdated from the outside, but from the inside it's still a nice hotel. Another thing that's important is that the Sheraton is easy to reach during the entire day. The Walk can be quite busy (especially during the evenings) and hotels such as the Hilton are impossible to reach by taxi, because taxi-drivers seem to avoid The Walk at busy hours. Checkin: This was quite an ordeal. My mom was staying in another room and my boyfriend and I were sleeping in the same room. I guess the different surnames (and same gender) were a bit confusing for the reception staff? We booked a room with a kingbed, but the staff offered us a room with twin beds instead. We decided not to make a fuss about it and accepted the twin bedroom. Restaurants: We booked halfboard and it only included the Palm Garden (buffet)restaurant for breakfast/dinner. At first we were a bit disappointed, but the food was amazing and in the end we had no complaints about it at all. The only thing I would like to note, is that especially during breakfast, it got a bit cold at some tables, because people kept walking in-/outside (via the restaurant) which caused a bit of a (cold) draft at times. Hotelroom: Very clean and nothing special to report about it, except for the beds... I never slept this good in a hotel. Would really like to know what kind of mattresses they used! Oh and if you really want open a window at night, take a room with a balcony, because the other rooms don't have opening windows (as far as I know). Staff: Amazing staff, that's all I can say. Remembered our faces/room-number after the first day. Never experienced that before (eat that Club Med!). And we were greeted with a smile everytime (doesn't matter who it was). Definitely made me want to return to this hotel in the near future. Beach: Don't know much about the beach, as I spent most of my time in the city... Looked very clean, but you gotta be in good shape, because there's a huge drop between the beach and the sea (about 2 meters/6 feet). They fitted some stairs to make life easier, but you have to be careful. Overall: Had a rough start, but quickly forgot about it... thanks to the great staff! Hope to return in the near future.

(the shops are more expensive than the UK but hey who goes all the way to Dubai to shop in UK High Street shops). There is an ice cream shop just as you enter the Atlantis which is brilliant for kids as they throw the ice cream around like cocktails and the selection is amazing. Taxis are very cheap and are readily available. The drivers are very respectful, helpful and polite.

I would say that this matter was dealt with discreetly and the staff were again always extremely polite. Yes there is currently building work next door and our room was next to this, but we never heard it at night or when the patio doors were closed. It was not a problem for us.

The worst thing about this hotel is the senior management. I was asked about my stay, which I duly provided. However, they did not like what I said, and suddenly accuse me of using profane language and being vulgar. I raised this to the management, and was told the staff member has been here for 10 years, so we are sorry, and if you have an issue take it up with Starwood. For all readers of this, that comment was made by General Manager, Dany Dagher - who also comments on this site. Hence, if you want to go to a hotel where the management really do not care about their guests (and actually insult you) and rooms are sub-standard then stay here. Personally, I would advise you to avoid staying in this horrendous place. Dubai has many more hotels.

It started life as one of a handful along the beach and it has now been dwarfed by all the Beach Residence and new hotels that have sprung-up. It has made the transition from business to lesuire and to-date continues to achieve high occupancy with young families from the UK and continental Europe. Despite the exceptional occupancy rates, I have to question how much is being reinvested into the resort. The painted-over cracks are starting to re-appear and the beach is eroding. With SPG in hand, but no SPG desk operating, I was disappointed that my preferences were not entirely observed, despite writing to the management of the hotel. Due to the high occupancy we were not immediately afforded any form of upgrade, which is unusual, but to be fair and after some discussion with management, two days later we were finally upgraded to a Tower Room with a huge roof patio, sun loungers, table and chairs. The room was clean, well maintained and although the patio was not cleaned regularly it was safe for my young daughter to meander or sit in the shade. This was worth the wait. Because most of the other Starwood brands in Dubai are distant and reluctant franchisees, and I am talking about the two Meridiens, Grosvenor and the Weston at the marina end of the beach, there are no SPG options at any of these which is unfortunate. A good proportion of cardholders will thus book this place and maybe cash in some points. To those, a word of advice: on the SPG site this hotel was not bookable directly. Instead you are invited to call the CR number and you are advised that there are no rooms in the category but you are offered options for more points than Cat 4 - don't think, as I did, that it wasn't available. I did get fifth night free under current promotion so it all worked out fine. If you want to cash-in on SPG, don't rely on the website, make a call. On another note, there is seemingly no benefit at all to staying in a Tower Room. As management informed me on day-one, the rooms are \"exactly the same, just higher up\". Frankly 'Tower' is a misleading description as it is only a 10 storey building. The so-called upgrade that SPG members should expect however is 'tower access' this means very little frankly and should NOT be put forward as an upgrade. 'Tower Access Upgrade' does not mean a Tower Room as I discovered. In fairness as SPG you will get breakfast included as part of your upgrade too and an option to have this in the 'Tower Lounge' as opposed to the main food hall. The Tower Lounge Breakfast where we ate a couple of times, is a cut-down buffet with about 20 tables. This gets very busy and seemingly all guests access the lounge without challenge. So all guests appear to have 'run-of-the-house'. If you stayed here on business, you would be infuriated by this! At 10:30 SHARP!!! the burners are removed and a crew in boiler-suits dismantle the buffet very abruptly. You are given a longer breakfast lease in the main hall (until 11) but... ...there the staff are completely burned-out and service has seemingly collapsed. This was a big disappointment. The breakfast service is anything but five-star. I was absolutely astonished when I went for a basic omlette at the cooking station and despite an enourmous basket of eggs beside the chef, my omlette was prepared by premix egg from a cardboard carton hidden in the corner of the griddle. Imagine that! Whoever allows this to go on should join the Motel 6 chain in the excited states and any food tech that pours premix egg from a box should also consider a career change! I would much rather do it myself. We stayed 6 nights altogether and breakfast was always the soucre of major irritation regardles of what time we dined. I asked for coffee and was directed with a flick of the nose 'over there' to a pot of coffee on a service stand. Asked for milk and it was lifted from a spent table. At the stroke of 10:40 it is 'last orders' at the buffet(!) and the bolier-suits re-appear to 'breakdown the breakfast' with the panache of a herd of starved elephants. My advice is therefore book room-only! The breakfast is not worth bolting from your holiday morning slumber for - that is for sure! A serious critique is needed internally to re-invent the maninstream F&B. We did not bother with the other outlets. It is a busy hotel that is clinging on to the coast (literally) in the face of new giants glaring down at them. Direct Beach Access and mature landscaped gardens with shady palms make-up for the other kinks I suppose, it is safe enough for children but you must watch them at all times because there is a mostly empty seat where the lifeguard should be. The other pool staff were very friendly and excellent at clearing out vacated loungers to find you agood spot. The swim-up bar is really just a place they keep the beer fridge - you need to shout loudly to get service from the other side where the dining area is and the music is blasting in your face. It is cowded too because they supplement the leisure facility with 'members' who reside elsewhere in Dubai and come to use the pool and beach. Five out of Ten with compliments to very busy front desk staff, pool deck staff and efficient handlers at the front door. Avoid anything other than direct sea-facing rooms because of Marine Club being constructed on a wedge of land next to hotel which when we stayed had completed some ground works and was starting to go vertical. Beyond that it is Jebel Ali's industrial coast.

I selected the property because I stayed in the neighborhood previously. Regrettably, I do not recommend this property. Date wise, it is quite old, and the interior is a bit tired. The service was hit or miss, primarily miss. Undoubtedly, there are nicer properties along the beach. As usual, The Good, The OK/Bad, and The Ugly The Good - Location. Right on the water and on a strip with countless restaurants and a collection of shops. If you like the water and plan to spend most of your time at the beach, then this spot should be on your list. - Beach facilities. While regrettably I did not use them, the facilities looked great. They had nice chairs and a large private beach area both on the sane and in a lawn area surrounded by leafy palm trees. The guests had their choice of sun or shade. - Outdoor cafe. We stopped in and had a drink one night. While the staff was slow, the setting was nice. The OK/Bad - I arrived about 00:30 (which is normal for Dubai) and my room was not ready. I find not excuse acceptable for not having my room ready at this hour. I waited for about 45 minutes and then was shown my room. On a side positive note, the front desk manager apologized, and offered me a complimentary drink in the bar. - The room. It was OK, but a bit dated as is the entire property. While my room had two beds, the one I slept in was comfortable and kept clean by the staff. The bathroom was fine space wise but had seen it's better days. The room did include a nice working desk. - Fitness center. Outdated, used equipment fills this space. While a nice amount of room, and a good selection of weights and machines, the elliptical machines were actually converted from bicycle machines and most settings simply did not work. It is clear that the management team had not spent time investing in this area. The Ugly - At checkout, I was asked if I used the mini-bar the night prior. I had - a Diet Coke. The employee called a colleague to check to ensure I was being honest. The same thing was happening to another gentleman checking out beside me. After about 10 minutes of waiting, I said \"enough.\" It's a can of soda that costs 15 Durhams. My bill was about 100 times that amount. It left a poor taste in my mouth and completed a \"book end\" that reflected my check-in. These two episodes will keep me from returning. - Expensive WiFi service that was spotty at best. While I don't like it, I accept that some properties charge for WiFi. BUT...if a property is going to charge, the least it can do is have acceptable service. Thumbs down Sheraton. - Breakfast experience. On the first morning (the only morning I ate breakfast) I came down at about 07:00. Upon selecting the buffet, I learned the chef was not yet there to make omelets and the like. Why not? If your breakfast begins at 06:30 and you advertise a chef - then that person should be there, or a substitute. The buffet was OK, nothing special. - From breakfast I should have learned, but one afternoon after some meetings a colleague and I wanted lunch. So we stopped in the lobby restaurant. A mistake. We both ordered a pastrami sandwich. I understand I am in Dubai and did not have high expectations, but being in the Sheraton, I thought the sandwich had a chance. How I was wrong. No kidding, the sandwich had a single slice of pastrami. I couldn't believe it and asked for the check. When the hostess asked if everything was fine, I said \"no\" and explained. She smiled and proceeded to do nothing. Hey Sheraton - if you are training your employees to ask questions, also train them to handle the answers.

We were not offered a welcome drink or anywhere to wash up/change. The receptionist never cracked a smile and looked thoroughly miserable. We then spent the next 3 hours wandering around the hotel with our hand luggage trying to find somewhere to rest in the end we fell asleep still in the clothes we had travelled in on a sunlounger. There is a weird 'one way' system in operation whereby you are not allowed to walk through the hotel to the beach - there is a security guard on the door who sends you outside via the spa even if you are a hotel guest! When we asked him why we couldn't go throught the door he said it was 'hotel policy' (Throughout our stay whenever we went outside we were asked by security if we were hotel guests- drove us mad after a while) When we went back to reception at noon we were handed the room cards but no explanation of where anything was etc. we had to ask how to get to our room! The personal service found in other hotels we have visited was seriously lacking at the Sheraton. Any communciation we received to our room was generic mass produced information addressed to 'Dear Hotel Guest' . With the exception of the ladies in the coffee bar and the cleaners the staff were unhelpful and miserable. We asked the concierge for details of the shuttle service to the malls, he barely looked up as he handed us a sheet with times but didn't offer any further information. The hotel itself is in serious need of updating, the reception area looks like it was last decorated in the 1970's. There is a major building project going on next door so the view is not good - mainly of cranes! The restaurants - On the first night we ate in the chinese restaurant which was nice but expensive and then we had three evening meals in the main buffet restaurant. This was fine the first time but the next two times when we arrived approx 9pm (restaurant is supposed to close at 11pm) the staff were already clearning up - there were no salad plates, no dessert bowls and the chef had disappeared so we ended up carving our own meat and helping ourselves to what was behind the counter! Also, when we returned to our table after fetching our desserts the waiter had cleared the table of cutlery and water! Not what you would expect from a 5* hotel and it wasn't cheap - between 190 - 220 dhs per person. You can find much better food and service if you go out of the hotel and choose one of the many restaurants on the 'walk' The room we stayed in was fine, although we overlooked the building site. It was cleaned to a good standard. The gym is fine and we used it most days during our stay, however there is no attendant to stop the children playing on the equipment as they did every evening we were there. Three times when we used the gym there were no towels and we had to go and ask for them. The beach - this was a tiny patch of sand crammed with white plastic sun loungers. It was supposed to be a private beach, however the hotel allows non-hotel residents to use it for a price so we were crammed in like sardines. You have to go and fetch your own towels and sign them out - we have never come across this at any other 5* hotel we have visited. The beach was plagued with flies too, attracted probably by the many yellow rubbish bins spread all over the beach. The beach bar 'Azure' was a wooden shack with a couple of fridges in it. New Year's Eve - there was a 'gala dinner' arranged and this worked out at an additional 2400dhs (\u00a3430.00) on top of what we had already paid for the hotel room. We chose not to participate, however what no one told us that all the other restaurants in the hotel closed because of the gala dinner and security prevented anyone going outside where the event was taking place unless they had booked. Because no one had explained this previously we hadn't booked anywhere in advance so ended up having room service at 11.30pm!! All in all our stay at the Sheraton was very disappointing. Our experience was by no means 5* Unfortunately we didn't look at the reviews on Trip Advisor before we booked or else we would have chosen somewhere else. If you are looking for exceptional service, beautiful surroundings, wonderful food and happy staff do not go to the Sheraton Hotel, instead pay a little extra and go to the One and Only Royal Mirage - that's where we will be returning to next time.", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna", "Title": "\u201cBad Value for Money - Unclean Rooms - Not at all 5*\u201d", "Author": "cosmoproletVienna", "ReviewID": "UR52147052", "Content": "I was staing in Dubai for vacation and chose this property because of the location on the beach and the possibility to redeem my points. Arriving at 2am check-in was smooth. Then however the trouble started. The room was quite ok, however nothing luxurious. The problem was that the bath-tub was not clean upon arrival. It contained hair and other leftovers from former guests. When the front desk called to check if everything was ok, I told them about it and they offered me to change the room. I refused since we had already unpacked and just asked them to assure proper cleaning the next day. On the next day I went to the room after breakfast and this time the sink was dirty, no drinking water was provided and some towels were missing. I went down to the front desk to complain. The lady noted everything and promised that it would not happen again. No apologies. Given the fact that I had to pay EUR 350 per night after I had redeemed my points I think one should be able to expect a properly cleaned room especially in a so called 5*. The next day the bath-tub was dirtier than ever before. This time the front desk contacted the housekeepeing manager so I could complain directly. The housekeeping manager was \"very sorry\" and promised better cleaning. After that (three days after arrival) the room was properly cleaned for the first time. Another problem at this hotel is the pool bar. They only have deep fried items at a ridicolous price on the menu. The staff is inattentive and not very friendly. Choice and quality of the food is three star level in the best case. Also you would not expect 10 year old plastic sun-loungers at a 5* hotel charging you 350 EUR per night. The only good things about this hotel are the friendliness of the staff of the Towers Lounge, The Grill Room (had fantastic if pricey dinner there) and the beach I would not return given the bad value for money. I am currently staying at the Grand Hyatt which is a benchmark for excellent service and quality at the same price-level.", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cA DECENT 4 STARS BUT NOT WORTHY OF 5\u201d", "Author": "StevieG489", "ReviewID": "UR51634291", "Content": "I\u2019m sure the Sheraton JBR was a 5 star hotel 10 years ago but it seems to be clinging on to those stars mainly by virtue of its location. Having booked the hotel as part of a package deal I\u2019m quite glad I didn\u2019t pay 5 star prices! Hotel \u2013 the hotel is quite small by Dubai standards compared to others such as the nearby Hilton hotel. There are (I think) 4 restaurants (one 24hr), a bar, a top floor lounge and a coffee shop. I used the gym facility once and it was perfectly adequate for most purposes with modern equipment and free weights. The lobby area has a corridor leading to a small convenience shop, a hairdresser, sauna/massage room and a squash court. Location \u2013 the location is fine if you want to be in the Jumeirah beach area. However, it is less convenient if you want to take regular trips to the centre of the old city. My taxi journey from the airport worked out at about GBP15 including the airport surcharge; GBP11 on the return leg. Both journeys took about 30 minutes with no traffic delays. I had no problems getting taxis as they queue up outside the hotel, even at 7am. Perhaps if I had been leaving at 4 or 5am I would have considered booking one. The Mall of The Emirates shopping centre is 10 minutes drive and the hotel has a free shuttle service which leaves about 3 times a day. It also serves the Ibn Battuta Mall. You are required to book this service as there are limited spaces on the bus. Restaurants \u2013 as a solo traveller, and on a budget, I tended not to use them. There are lots of cheaper alternatives nearby including some well-known chains: KFC, Pizza Hut, Pizza Express, Subway, Starbucks etc. Ideal if you dont wish to splash out GBP35 every night. There are also many independent Italian, Mexican and Asian restaurants to choose from. Room \u2013 check in is 3pm. I arrived early (2pm) and was offered a smoking room as an alternative to my 'not ready room'. Note to non-smokers: DO NOT ACCEPT A SMOKING ROOM! I inspected one and it was terrible! A non-smoking room was a big improvement but had the feel of a 4 star room than a 5 star. I didn\u2019t use the mini bar as the prices were crazy \u2013 GBP3 for a chocolate, GBP8 for a small can of beer, GBP5 for a small bottle of water. You get the idea. I had a land view room which overlooked a building site. Not a problem for me as there wasn\u2019t much noise. My room had a (locked) interconnecting door to the room next door. I could hear a lot of noise from the neighbours whose child had a habit of shrieking every 5 minutes! A bit annoying especially on the first night when it woke me up. Breakfast \u2013 this takes place from 6:30-11am and don\u2019t even think about getting there after 9am! I recommend no later than 8am. The caf\u00e9 cannot cope with the volume of people and it\u2019s like feeding time at the zoo! I found the food below the standard expected for a 5 star and have experienced better at 2 and 3 star hotels. The usual offerings were available: pastries, yoghurt, tinned and fresh fruit, cereals. The cooked items looked unappetising \u2013 orangey looking (rather than yellow) scrambled eggs etc. Even the tea and coffee were a little disappointing. Internet \u2013 there is no free service but if you switch on your laptop the wireless will connect you to the Starwood Resorts internet login where you will be asked to pay about GBP5 for 30minutes, GBP9 for 60minutes, or GBP17 for 24 hour access. What a joke. I ended up visiting a nearby caf\u00e9, buying a coffee for GBP2 and using their free internet service. Staff - no real problems except sometimes they appear disorganised. For example, a second housekeeper visited my room shortly after someone else had cleaned it. Pool/Beach\u2013 the pool is quite small but there was an adequate number of sun loungers to cater for most people. Again, the beach is quite small. All in all I would say the hotel is fine if you go with the expectation of a 4 star and only pay 4 star prices. It is ideal for someone just looking to sit by the pool for a few days and do a bit of shopping.

As such the trip was part holiday and part exploration. We heard so much about Dubai that we had to see what all the fuss was about and after reviewing comments on this website booked with the Sheraton on HB basis. A few reviews mentioned that travellers had issues with the board basis but simply emailing the hotel prior to the visit stopped any issues there. We also asked for a double and the staff managed even this request. As a rule my partner and I eat out alot and so invariably you visit other hotels. Most of the good restaurants in Dubai are situated in hotels so in eating out you also see what other holiday makers are getting and experiencing. And after staying for ten days we visited and ate in alot of hotels and so can give a fairly balanced view. The Sheraton is clean, quiet (no screaming unruley kids running amok), the food is as good as I've seen and better for buffet style meals while the Peacock chinese restaurant is excellent. The grounds are nice and well kept, there is always sun beds available and most importantly the staff are polite and accomodating. The beach is man made and like most of the area's around Jumeriah there is very little sea life. Dont expect Red Sea flora and fauna. For this you need to go down to Mussadam, Oman. As for internet access I was slightly put off by the fact that the Sheraton charge. All over Dubai there are WIFI hotspots that are free - so why charge. So if you can take the netbook and go across the road to Starbucks, buy and coffee and download. To finish I would recommend this hotel for couples, those with very young children or anyone who likes to relax through the day rather than listen to a riot. if you want that go to Jumeriah Beach- its like a large creche-playschool. Go for dinner at the Hilton Dubai creek and eat at Verre - its excellent.

Repetitive to say the least. Breakfast was nothing to write home about.The wine was EXTORTIONATELY priced for glorified vinegar. The wait staff were so prejudiced.

The security guard claimed that it was against the law to allow people in swimwear to enter the lobby.

We arrived at 4am to be shown to our room which was all very nice. In the morning whilst taking a stroll around the site we noticed a very small sign (the only sign) that had been placed by the pool. The sign stated that the pool was going to close for renovations that evening and remain closed for 9 days. We were due to stay 10. When we booked our honeymoon we expected to have full use of the pool as well as the beach. We did not expect the whole hotel to be stuck on the very small patch of private beach having no refreshing pool to dive into. As we had saved for over a year to pay for this holiday we were understandably disappointed. We complained to the reception staff and then the manager whose explanation was that they can't help the pool requiring a renovation. I was furious and very upset. The hotel rep initially was uncontactable. The reception staff told us the problem was with our travel agent in the UK. As the pool was in Dubai as were we, we couldn't understand his logic. The travel agents claimed they never received any notifiaction about the closure. After 1 and a half days of our honeymoon being wasted on basically sitting on the reception (as they refused to speak to us) the rep finally gained approval from the travel agent to move us to the Hilton down the beach. The Hilton was fantastic. Stay there, not here. Additionally we booked Half board but on our first evening were given a bill for dinner. The half board only included \u00a320 worth of dinner for some reason and there was no warning of this either.

Yes the hotel is next to a construction site (the Marina)didnt bother us at all, but bearing in mind the amount of construction in Dubai, not a problem. If you dont want to see construction sites then dont come to Dubai as it is a work in progress. Traffice can get quite congested at times if you are moving across the city, this is due to the ongoing roadworks. Afternoon tea at the Burj Al Arab was fun and you felt like royalty. Didnt come across any bad or surly waiters as others seem to have, everybody was very pleasant, polite and helpful. As for the malls - I would also agree that the prices are more expensive than here although that is based on one visit to the Emirates mall.

We chose the hotel solely because of the loyalty program as we were actually offered cheaper rates at newer and more posh hotels. Our dissatisfaction doesn't stop there. Throughout our one month stays, we were given rude and unhelpful front desk and guest service. Example, a few of us had our free internet connections expired within 2 weeks of stay and requested for it to be renewed. The front desk and guest service did not get a simple task done, in fact, wasted almost half of our day coming back and forth the counter to check on the status (obviously, they promised to get back to us everytime we were there). As I don't want to be long-winded, I hope this example can show you how bad are they in serving the customers. For Starwood preferred guests, you better fight for your privileges as it is not given to you even if you asked. We, being at least Gold status guests, fought for so long during check in just to get into preferred floors. Also, for those who is going in through group bookings, be very careful with the sales and marketing staff. They are all unhelpful cons. When you faced problems pertaining to what was contracted, they will show up and give you promises that it will be settled but there will be no news from them after that, i.e., no follow up at all.

It was a last minute choice to replace another destination where we couldn't find a flight. We have been twice to Dubai in the past with much better ( and much higher price ) hotels.

The hotel is really anonymous, could be there or everywhere else, is just a regular Sheraton, probably the only Arabian touch are few pillow on a carpet on one of the lobby corner. Rooms are spacious and clean, we were upgraded to a sea view room thanks to my gold Starwood Hotel card. Big deal ! City view rooms have the tallest building of Dubai Marina just across the street and no matter how your floor is high, the front tower is at least 30 floors higher than you, so sea view rooms are for me mandatory. The beach is nice and clean with a beautiful garden between the beach and the hotel, beach chairs are comfortable too. Food is average at the Palm restaurant, every night there is a buffet dinner, best are Lebanese and Indian nights. There are also a Chinese restaurant and a grill restaurant where you can dine with a credit if you are in half or full board or pay a la carte . We haven't been there. The SPA is OK and the fitness center is small but well equipped. Vines and other alcohol drinks are expensive, but a bottle of San Pellegrino water for 6 euro is OK. All the staff is very friendly specially waiters and housekeepers. Outside there is the Dubai Marina where, if you like it you can find a great selections of fast food, bar and little more.

We were very pleased we did that as enjoyed both for different reasons. We arrived by the hotel car service of the Four Points that was close in price to a taxi and had the driver demand a tip. On departing the hotel for the airport we had a lovely taxi driver who had wonderful knowledge of his country and city Dubai. It took about 45 minutes. We took a few taxis to visit nearby areas during our stay, Mall of Emirates being one and the hotel was well known so no problems getting there & back. RECEPTION/RESERVATION A friendly and professional staff member greeted us when we arrived. Our reservation was as we had booked it, a club lounge room including breakfast. As our stay was at the end of Ramadan we had the restaurant and bar services explained to us as well as a letter detailing the opening hours of each one. The staff member highlighted the Ramadan tent on the beach with the buffet dinner and that the club lounge would be operational as normal. It was nice to have this information that was important to us given at the beginning of our experience at the hotel so we knew what was open when. On the morning we left the hotel there was one staff member to six different guests waiting for service. Perhaps there was a staff member off sick or not available to work, however a second staff member would have assisted in a more efficiency and pace of the queue. ROOM We were on the same floor as the club lounge, had a spacious room with a big balcony that looked over the walk of the newly constructed area. There was no noise and the construction was in the last stages when we stayed here so we did not have any bad experience with noise or view. To us, to see so many modern structures was amazing, so we did not mind not having the water view as we starred at the Dubai of tomorrow out of the window! The service involved in the club room was outstanding. The staffs were all very friendly and welcoming; there was a turn down service of a night where we had gifts left on our pillows and little chocolates. We also found a gift from the hotel in our room, something we certainly did not expect and thought was very nice! The room had a sitting area, TV with satellite channels, mini bar, as well as a very comfortable bed! There were two bottles of water replaced twice a day in our room as well as unlimited soft and hot drinks available unlimited throughout the day in the club lounge. The amenities in the bathroom were restocked twice a day and a good choice was available. There was sun tan lotion, tooth brushes, shampoo, conditioner, soaps, mouthwash, and bath gel to mention a few. If one forgot an item at home is sure to find it here or have it made available if not in the room! The room was nice and clean and pleasant. It had good air condition in the room; however we chose to leave one of our two cards in to keep it operating when not in the room as there was a slight smell of humidity if we left it off. The bathroom was of a good size, again not the latest in modern that is offered in hotel rooms however very clean and loved the extra towels available. FACILITIES The Club Lounge was worth the extra money to enjoy as part of our room price. The lounge had free internet terminal (only the one) with the request of only short time use, friendly staff on the door to meet and greet, and a good range of drinks (both alcoholic and non alcoholic) to enjoy. Of the evening supper that also includes snacks was an excellent range!! The breakfast had again a very pleasing selection of options and the staff member made coffee orders on request. The balcony that is off the Club Lounge offered wonderful views of the beach, Palm Island in the distance and nearby buildings. We enjoyed a light meal at The Coffee House in the lobby area, nice fast service. The beach area was well organised, we got the towels from the staff member just on the entry area to the beach and didn\u2019t have any problems getting the sun lounge and umbrella. The water was 28 degrees and so lovely to swim in! The view of the distant Palm Island was to the right with other construction. The only thing we did not like about this hotel was we had to cross the hotel lobby to access the elevator to go to the hotel rooms from the pool/beach area. AREA It was a short taxi ride to the Mall of Emirates the largest shopping mall where just about everything could be found! We ate at the buffet style restaurant at the Sezzam restaurant at Kempinski Hotel Mall of Emirates whilst watching Ski Dubai! Amazing. We visited the Miraj Islamic Centre, a very interesting museum and showroom. Nearby and in the surrounding area of the hotel was nice to take a walk through the new area, there were a few eateries and coffee shops to choose from in the area too. Dubai is a city that has so much to offer a visitor and the time we spent choosing the areas we would stay in was worth doing as the options are endless.

Also, the room safe didn't work, but they came up withus, unscrewed the safe and brought another a few minutes later! Despite a shaky start, we really enjoyed staying here, though I agree with a previous review that there was very little information about services. I was pleased therefore that I'd remembered various trip advisor reports. eg 1.there was a free shuttle to a mall. Actually, it was a pretty new one with fantastic architecture(based on about 6 different countries(inc china, India.Persia) but the shops vere very average and we struggled to fill the 2.5 hours here. 2.buying a bolttle of water on the beach for 6dhs(just under \u00a31) got you a coolbox full of ice to keep it and any other things cold. Other things of note: when you approached the beach, an attendant cape with 2 towels for each, and arranged one on the sunbed you'd chosen, and made a pillow out of the other! The evening meal buffet was fantastic(even if not included, well worth the price(just over \u00a320).

This wasnt explained to us and I blame the travel agent for this, however the hotel staff were sympathetic and helpful and had rooms available for us for 11am. The hotel itself is very nice and the rooms we had were spacious, comfortable and could not fault it. Only one comment I'd make is I would have liked a balcony. The gardens and hotel grounds are spotless and the staff always pleasant. We were half board and the breakfasts and evening meals were delicious with plenty to choose from. The pool was nice and cool and made a change from the sea (having spent 12 nights in the Maldives previously). However we walked down to the beach and could not believe how warm the sea water was - warmer than a bath at home. The Jumeirah beach area is still under construction and the sight of skyscrapers has to be seen to be believed. The buildings are amazing when all lit up at night and there was plenty to do. 3 nights isnt enough to enjoy everything Dubai has to offer. Just along from our hotel is a KFC (which was still being worked on) and a Pizza place - delicious pizzas at great prices. Buying alcohol in the hotel was pretty expensive but I suppose staying in a 5* hotel you can expect to pay 5* prices. We went to the Mall of the Emirates which is home to Ski Dubai - amazing that the outside temperature was in the 40's and the ski centre was -6. We also ventured to the Gold Souk and although it was extremely hot outside even in late afternoon there are some of the shops indoors with air conditioning. The sight of gold and diamonds is amazing but you have to haggle when buying anything. I bought a yellow/white gold ring and have seen the same ring on the internet costing \u00a3500 more than I paid. Its worth shopping about though as there is so much to choose from and dont just buy the first thing you see. Not sure id I was just lucky or if that kind of saving is normal. On the day we left, we were picked up at 4.10am and it was still hot, it was like standing in front of a fan oven at high temerature - thankfully hotels and restaurants all had air con. One final thing - Dubai Airport, an amazing sight. We got off the plane and it took us 20 mins on a bus to get to the terminal building.

We knew this when we booked, but coming from a multi-cultural city like London, I presumed that non muslims would just carry on as normal! how stupid i was!!! The muslim men would not acknowledge us women! and any enquiries made to local taxi drivers fell on deaf ears or were answered with grunts! this was very intimidating, the hotel staff were mainly hindu's we discovered so everyone there were friendly and had no probs talking to us. there is definately a gendre split there and women are seen as second class. I DO NOT ADVISE ANYONE TO TRAVEL THERE DURING RAMADAM!!. The nightlife during the holy month was almost non-existent which was a shame as normally in the area's with lots of ex-pats the bars and clubs are supposedly really really good!! luckily for us the sheraton actually allowed you to eat and drink and smoke during sunlight hours!! eating was to be done behind screens though. music was also allowed. The thing i found most amazing in Dubai were the buildings!! they are works of art! beautiful shapes and sizes they are really pretty. the mall of the emirates has the indoor ski slope! this was great fun!!! you can't leave dubai without having taken a ski lesson in dubai!! The madinat was a great place to go in the evenings and probably a better hotel to stay in apart from it had no beach as far as i was aware. there were a wide variety of restaurants and bars. trader vic's had a really good atmosphere the food was delicious and the cocktail list was very impressive! The sheraton hotel had a quiet atmosphere, again this was due to the month of year, the grounds were beautiful and well kept. the beach was lovely and the seawater was warm like a bath!! the hotel restaurants were really nice and the asian restaurant upstairs was delicious. (they even taught me how to make swan table decorations from napkins!) the hotel bar was quiet and cosy for a chat, no chance of anyone breaking into a song and dance though!

It was very interesting to see all the local men in their traditional clothing, enjoying the celebrations. I would go back to Dubai, and even stay at the Sheraton again, as it is in a nice quieter area (from the beach you couldnt see any of the many cranes that litter the dubai skyline) The hotel isn't in the happening area of town, but you can't walk anywhere anyway, everyone relies on taxis to take them through the construction site that is this city, so it makes no difference.

If you are wanting to be right in the hub of Jumeirah, and pay the prices of the humongous Hotels down the beach (One & Only etc...) then this Hotel is not for you. It is the smallest Hotel on Jumeirah, and the others literally tower above it. Its also the last Hotel on the Beach, so taxis are needed to get you everywhere. We booked into a standard room, and it was fine. Not the most modern or stylish of rooms, but never the less comfortable and problem free. They were spacious enough too and had all the amenities you would expect in a Hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful, especially the concierge desk. The only thing I would say is you usally have to wait for a taxi, and sometimes this can be half an hour plus if its busy. But you can't not get a taxi as at the time we went, there was nothing around the Hotel e.g. bars, shops, restaurants so you couldn't just go for a stroll. The Marina however was being developed, which you could tell will be great for the location of this Hotel. Not sure when that will be done however. Dubai is expensive, so be prepared to spend, especially in the larger Hotels. We did go the the Gold Souk one night however, and managed to get a kebab from a local stand for about 50p, and it was lovely. The beach at the Hotel is good, but busy. Even busier on a weekend (in Dubai the weekend starts on a Friday) where they offer day passes to the locals who can use the facilities at the Hotel, so if you order food from the Beach bar, there may be a wait.

So why the mixed feelings? Well, the location of the hotel so far away from everything else and in the midst of the enormous construction projects going on (although most have been finished) gives a sense of isolation. Sure, taxis are plentiful and cheap and you can't go anywhere in Dubai without a car anyway, but still there's this weird sense of being isolated in a man-built paradise with the sound of the waves and birds in the palm gardens competing with the sounds of the harsch reality going on outside the hotel complex with hundreds (even thousands?) of immigrant workers working around the clock to finish the luxury homes.

I guess this is appreciated by many, but as a Swede I'm a bit uneasy of having people do every little thing for me. It just feels a bit like unnecessary luxury - a feeling that permeates all of Dubai. In summary, the hotel is recommended if you are looking to be pampered and for pure relaxation. But if you're looking for an experience that will enrich you as a person, don't go here - in fact don't go to Dubai at all..", "Date": "April 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAvoid - Not Sheraton Quality\u201d", "Author": "LeFlaneur", "ReviewID": "UR14397092", "Content": "First of all, the \"Sheraton Jumeirah Beach\" is neither remotely near Jumeirah nor does it have a beach anymore.

The staff were always making sure you were enjoying your stay and everything was very clean, which I really appreciated - there was always someone cleaning something at all hours, crazy. The beach staff was so nice too. They even set our chairs out in the mornings for us b/c they remembered we liked to be positioned directly under the sun so to get an even tan lol. One of the guys even set a jewellry book on my chair and said I could give my boyfriend some ideas haha. By that time though, I had already bought myself a present from Cara's! :D The buffet at breakfast was soooo good. It was only 145 AED for 2 each morning, if I'm not mistaken, and there was tons of variety such as cooked to order omelets, pancakes, sausages, meats, poached eggs, a selection of cheeses, breads, smoked salmon, tons of fruit, juices, cereal, yogurts etc. The Tea House was really good, they had the BEST chicken quesadillas (and sour cream), which we have ZERO of either in Rome! Their river boat dessert (a banana split) was sooo good too. That being said, on to the gym! The gym was a really nice facility. It had elliptical trainers, bikes, rowing machines, free weights, it was agood set up, well air-conditioned. They also had lockers with a sauna and steam room. The hotel rooms were very comfortable; they weren't modern or sleek but they were beachy and pleasant. The bathroom robes, slippers and selection of shampoo, condidtion, mouthwash, shower gel, was a nice touch. Ours had a view of the ocean and the Jumeriah Beach Residences, which I might add are finished now so no cranes there - but there are some in the distance, which I believe were on the palm. Concierge was very heplful. They always answer the phone with \"Good Evening Ms. _____\" which I liked and they were also very helpful. Room service was lightening fast. My glass of wine came up in literally 3 minutes. Liked that alot. Location was also good, you can get a hotel car for 35 AED or less, depending on where you're going, or a cab for even less. The only bad experience we had, had nothing to do with the hotel. A cab driver tried to rip us off and didn't think we would notice the fact that he was circling all around the marina. When we asked him why he was going this way, he said the roads were closed - biggest bunch of crap, especially since we were just on those same roads a few hours before! So basically my boyfriend yelled at him and said if he didn't get us to the hotel in 1 minute, he was going to have big problems. Suddenly, he knew the way. He got scared and took us there asap.

The first thing, and there's no getting away from it, is that the hotel is surrounded on 3 sides by massive construction sites. But as other reviewers have noted, so are all the hotels at that end of Dubai, including some such as the Ritz-Carlton which are considerably more expensive than the Sheraton. Yes, it would be nicer without all the construction, but it wasn't too intrusive in the hotel grounds and if you sat in the gardens (large, lots of sunbeds), you were either looking at the beach or inward looking at fully completed although not yet occupied 30/40-odd storey buildings which were not unpleasant. The downside of the building work is the dust, and although we had paid for a sea-facing Towers room, we didn't use the balcony at all as all the chairs and the floor needed wiping down with a wet cloth. I suppose I could have asked Housekeeping to do this, but we were out most of the time anyway. Apart from this, our room itself was really nice, clean and spacious, with a sea-view. We received fresh bottles of mineral water each day, and a fruit platter and 2 chocolate bunnies for Easter! If you book the Towers rooms, you get access to the Exec lounge on the 9th floor, where you can get soft drinks etc all day, and complimentary cocktails and canapes and wine/beer from 6-7pm. There is also free internet access in the lounge. We were on a B & B basis, and I was really impressed with the breakfast buffet in the main restaurant. They had everything you could possibly want in abundance, and a fabulous lady who could whip up 2 omelettes in about 30 seconds flat! We had lunch on the terrace one day, which was very nice, but apart from this we didn't eat in the hotel as we wanted to get out and about and see things. I recommend the Dubai Creek Bateaux dinner cruise. The food was all freshly cooked, (of course you should expect that, but sometimes on these things, it's not the case), the wine list not too bad, and transfers to/from the hotel were included. Also good fun, if a bit cheesy, is the 'Sundowner' trip. You go into the desert in 4-wheel drive vehicles, do a bit of dune-bashing and then go to a 'Bedouin' camp for food and drinks (included in the price). I hadn't realised how huge Dubai is, and although I knew from the little travel-agents maps of the hotel sites that the Sheraton was the last one along that bit of the coastline, I foolishly imagined that one could take a nice walk along the beach/prom to get to the other hotels, such as the Burj. BIG MISTAKE!!! You can't walk to anywhere at that end and probably wouldn't want to because of the construction sites. Even at the Burj al Arab hotel end, there is still a lot of major road construction going on, so we couldn't even walk the half-mile or so from the Mall of the Emirates to the Burj even though we could clearly see the 'sail', there is no pedestrian access across the sites! However, the taxis are very cheap (and all metered, so there's no need to be wary). All in all, we enjoyed Dubai as a short break. I would class the Sheraton as a city break that happens to have a beach. Personally, I think if you're looking for an idyllic beach holiday, you could spend your money more wisely elsewhere, and perhaps I am comparing it a little unfairly with the Maldives (we stayed in Dubai after 7 days in the Maldives), but I wasn't impressed with the beach at the Sheraton at all. I'd go back to Dubai but not for 5 years or so. If I was to go again soon, I would stay at the other end at the Mina a' Salam or Al Qasr, or Lottery-win permitting, at the Burj!

Further- on my first night I saw a rat just outside the back door of the hotel. I reported it quietly to a member of staff and I expected her to immediately deal with it and call pest control. Instead I was told that reported sightings of vermin are frequent due to the building works! The hotel itself appears clean (although the rat incident really caused us unease). We heard scraping during at least 3 nights of our stay and we asked to be allocated a change of room. We were convinced the scraping sound had to be rats after what we had seen. Further, the building works were audible early in the morning. The staff promptly dealt with our request and we had no problems with noise after that as we were allocated a sea view room. When we looked out the window of our 4th floor new room thick dust was clearly visable on the trees below which made me wonder how clean the air we were breathing was!

About half the rooms face the works, which is wonderful as you'd expect. Also when lounging by the pool - it directly faces the 5-10 immense tower blocks that are being built a stones throw away. Upon completion this hotel will just be lost in amongst the skyscrapers.

The service was definitely 5 star from start to finish. We had arrived early(10am) and officially our room would only be ready by 3pm,however the staff managed to get us into a room within a few hours. We did request a non-smoking room and as there was no availability we were put into a smoking room. We highlighted this to the staff who were helpful in checking room availability every day, within 2 days we were given a room with a MASSIVE balcony (well worth the wait!) The room was very clean, and well presented!! Room service was prompt! Service on the beach was great, the staff were very helpful - when we got our beach towels a member of staff would setup up our seats and umbrella if required! Service came with a SMILE! One of the drawbacks staying at the sheraton was the cost of the food within the hotel restaurants. However for about \u00a35-\u00a310 you can go into town and enjoy a cheaper meal! Another drawback would be the views and the building works that were going on around the hotel - however this did not disrupt our stay - around the hotel it was a little dusty although the beach and pool area were immaculately clean! Overall we enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel to others.", "Date": "November 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London,UK", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel but very poor service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4067030", "Content": "We had a 5 night break here-the hotel itself was nice but the buiding work does affect the entire hotel and looks very ugly all around the hotel.The hotel prices were too expensive for the quality-this was my 3rd visit to dubai and i am surprised this hotel has a 4-5 star rating.location is poor.The front desk service was very poor-could not help to reconfirm flights,also our pick up was 6am to return,breakfast was meant to be included but they gave a cup of tea,instead on arrival at 7am they could have given breakfast-we had paid for breakfast for 5 nights-not4.They werent even apologetic.Having used the sheraton group in the past i would not recommend them at all now.", "Date": "October 28, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sheraton Jumeirah Beach Resort", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d304493-Reviews-Sheraton_Jumeirah_Beach_Resort-Dubai.html", "Price": "$157 - $539*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Al Sufouh Road, P.O.
