It was really no problem - a lovely way to see different rooms in the hotel and our bags were moved each time. The family was really helpful with directions and advice, also with polishing up my Turkish phrases and making me practice! All the rooms had their diferent advantages - we liked the last room at the top of the house best as most spacious and a real bird's eye view of the ferry port and the Marmara Sea. Breakfast was a Turkish feast of fruit, bread, dishes like ravioli and tabbouleh, olives, cheese, cold meat, boild eggs etc with tea, coffee, chocolate. It's in an ideal location, in a little back street in Sultanahmet where children played marbles in the evening, just a few minutes from the Blue Mosque one way and the tram line and the Gran Bazaar the other.

It's easily accessible from the airport if you ordered a shuttle or probably harder to find if you get there by yourself (it's not easy to find hotel the first time), but then you will find it easily. The area where hotel located is Sultanhamet (the most touristic place in the city) and where you can find a lot of places for dinner or just having snack. The rooms were clean, big enough for spending few nights. The bed were comfortable. Quiet and peacefull place (if not notice muezzin's calls from mosques but it's usual thing for Istanbul). Bathroom has a good condition and very big in Cleopatra's room. It was terrific to have breakfast and see roof of many houses and beautiful Marmara sea. The owner Oktay is helpful and friendly, booked us transfer from/to airport, give us some useful advices. Breakfast is very basic but ok if you remember how much you pay per night. There were delicious bread and natural yogurt, eggs, cheese, some fruits and vegetables. But some my fastidious friends were disappointed such breakfast.

We also had a lot of windows, so the room got nice light, and there were embroidered sheers for privacy. The curtains did a good job of shielding the light in the morning when we were sleeping. The bathroom looked new and had a roomy floor-level shower with lots of hot water and a Western toilet. There is wireless Internet, but we didn't use that since we weren't traveling with our computers, so I can't comment on how well it worked. We only had two complaints. First, the hotel is three floors (no elevator) and has difficult stairs. It's a gorgeous spiral staircase with marble steps, but it's steep and twisty and doesn't have a handrail all along it; plus, there are motion-sensor lights that don't activate until you're halfway up the flight of steps, so you have to navigate in low light sometimes. This was a very minor issue for me as a 20something, but my 60 year old mother had difficulty with it, and I imagine it could be hazardous for the elderly or little kids. The only other issue we had was the bed linens. The beds were only outfitted with a flat (not fitted) sheet on the mattress and a thin blanket. We missed the usual top sheet, and kept having to tuck in and reposition the bottom sheet since it wasn't fitted. I'm guessing this is a local custom, but as exhausted tourists, we would have appreciated Western bedding. Also, the thin blanket wasn't enough for me for the cool nights - however, I used the blanket from the third bed, and I imagine they would have given us an extra one if we had asked. Overall, we felt this was a good value in a great spot, and we liked that it was family-run. It's always nice to support family businesses, and Otkay, the owner, was clearly dedicated. With the addition of a complete handrail on the stairs and Western bedding, this place would be absolutely fantastic! As it is, I would recommend it!", "Date": "May 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton", "Title": "\u201cCentric,lovely owners,nice rooms,perfect terrace\u201d", "Author": "MayWhatever", "ReviewID": "UR30452479", "Content": "We went a group of 9 friends and we enjoyed a lot in this hotel.

Which is Ok my household and generally accepted for the money we paid for our stay and Oktay's family afforts to run the business. Hope they are profitable! They are hard workers. Breakfast is basic, but again for the money we paid - worth it. Oktay speaks very good English and probably French. All his recommendation where to go, what to see, where to eat appeared to be extremely useful. Their neighbours are doing constraction works, only once during our 5 days stay they woke us up at 8, The rest of the days they have been quiet. The street has no traffic at all so the the only noise would be a song from the mosque at about 5 am which is unavoidable in any place in Istanbul.", "Date": "May 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cWarm, friendly and helpful family running an authentic hotel conveniently located\u201d", "Author": "Lazas", "ReviewID": "UR28926193", "Content": "Booked via the internet, and personal confirmation email within 24 hours.
