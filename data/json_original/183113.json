On our return I called the hotel and the bus was there to pick us up in 10 minutes. He drove us back to the hotel. We checked in at 5:00 am, thanks to a flight delay. The front desk attendant told us that we would be allowed to stayuntill 1:00 pm considering the late arrival. That was nice. We were assigned our room and had keys in hand in no time at all. We were offered complimentary muffins and coffee or tea. I declined but my wife had a muffin. The room was big, clean and well appointed. There was a king size bed with plenty of blankets, a big screen TV, coffee maker and a clean bathroom with a full bath. When we checked out the front desk attendant called the bus driver and he arrived within minutes to take me back to the parking lot. I opted to leave the bags with my wife at the hotel and returned with the car. Everything was as smooth as glass. I was truly impressed.

I booked directly with the hotel and phoned the afternoon of the 20th to confirm that we would be checking in after midnight as our flight didn't arrive in Toronto until 11:55 p.m. After our bags arrived, we called for the shuttle. After a bit of a wait, another hotel's shuttle offered to take us to the Carlingview as our shuttle had not arrived, even though we were told they are very close to the airport and it only takes a couple minutes for the shuttle to get there. Upon arrival at the hotel (after 1:00 a.m.), we were greeted by the desk clerk who confirmed he had our reservation, however, they had overbooked and they did not have any rooms available. He indicated that they had called other area hotels, but they were all sold out as well. A man who arrived shortly after we did was given the same news. The clerk suggested we wait in the lobby and \"hopefully\" they'd have a room in a couple of hours. Given that we had to be back at the airport by 6:30 a.m. for our flight to New York and the fact that it was highly unlikely that anyone was going to be checking out in the middle of the night, his suggestion was completely unhelpful. Since it was obvious that the hotel was going to do nothing to rectify the situation, I began phoning other hotels. I finally found one in Brampton that had one room left (there were four of us), but one room was better than none. At least the hotel paid for our cab ride to the other hotel, but that was hardly compensation for the inconvenience. The Carlingview required a credit card at the time of booking to guaranty our rooms - perhaps they need to look up the definition of guaranty as the meaning clearly eludes them.

We arrived extremely late at night, exhausted, and longing to get to our room for a meagre 4 hours sleep prior to an early morning wake up to get to the airport in time for our flight. To that end, we had the confirmation information for our booking handy to show to the reception staff. To our surprise and distress, the hotel had not yet received an e-mail from Hotels.com confirming our booking and arrival. We understand that this problem was created by Hotels.com. That said, we would expect that the reception staff would have let us go to our room, given our clear proof of a confirmation number and the late hour. Alas to our considerable dismay, the woman in charge (manager) assisted on calling Hotels.com before letting us go to our room. Already exhausted, we were kept waiting a good 45 minutes while she tried to get through to Hotels.com. In fact, out of mounting frustration and anger, it was I, using my cell phone to dial a number found on my confirmation papers, who managed to get through first to begin to rectify the situation. Once the manager was able to speak to someone herself, to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that payment had already been made and would be delivered to her hotel, did she do us the great favour of letting us go to our room. What else? The room was OK, the shuttle driver was extremely friendly and competent.

All three stays were stopovers while connecting flights to other destinations on the next morning. For our first stay, the Carlingview Airport Inn was recommended and booked by my travel agent in July 2010. My son and I found the hotel to be very nice and truly appreciated the free shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel. The shuttle bus was air-conditioned, clean, and comfortable and the bus driver even loaded and unloaded our luggage! When we first arrived at the front desk of the hotel, we were met by a lovely, polite and professional employee by the name of Mercedes. She processed our stay and we were in our hotel room in less than 5 minutes. Mercedes even went as far as to ask us about our connecting flights on the next morning and set up the wake-up calls and even booked the free shuttle bus to take us back to the airport at 3:00 am. The hallways were always clean and the hotel rooms were always very presentable and bug free. Although the Carlingview Airport Inn is not a spanking brand new establishment, it has been well maintained, the rooms renovated and upgraded and very clean. The beds were always clean, firm and very comfortable. The sheets were very new, clean, white and crisp. The furniture was dust free, clean and good shape. It was obvious that the rooms have been renovated and well maintained. The hotel did have free Internet connection which was functional and without problems. The lobby and breakfast area, although small, was clean and presentable. Coffee and tea was available all day but unfortunately, the fresh and delicious Danishes are put away at 7:00 am as this is the time when the breakfast brigade is over. Too bad for those guests that have later flights to catch! That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life! The Carlingview Airport Inn does not have its own swimming pool, but guests have full and unrestricted use of the pool located at the hotel next door (very close).

Also when 10 or 15 guests are in the lobby and breakfast area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c things start to bottleneck as space and seating is very limited.

I had made the reservation a couple of months prior,and the day we were leaving, I looked on the website,and saw they had advertised a lower rate than I had booked.....I called the toll-free number,and they took another $10 off each of the 2 rooms we had booked,so we had a saving of $20 plus tax....... The first time I stayed there (December 2007) we were very pleased so had no qualms about staying there again.And again,the hotel lived up to our expectations. We checked in about 11pm.There is a Greek restaurant in the hotel,and they were just closing up,but offered to prepare something for those just checking in. We went right to bed,as we had only a few hours to rest.The room was clean and comfortable,just as I recalled from last time......There was some noise in the night as it was Friday night,and 4 young guys shouting and shoving in the parking lot for awhile but,other than that,enjoyed my few precious hours of rest. At 3am, I reported for the continental brekkie and had Red Rose tea and 2 pastries.Not a great selection but something to help start the day before you get to the airport for a real breakfast. The staff was very friendly, they had a free computer in the lobby you can use,and most importantly,this hotel offers 24 hour shuttle service to and from the airport,which so many of the hotels in this area do not. So,just as the first time we stayed there,we were more than satisfied with this hotel,and it is highly likely we will stay there again when we need to find a Toronto airport hotel.It certainly works well for us....", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Trinidad", "Title": "\u201cgood airport hotel for early morning travellers\u201d", "Author": "james238", "ReviewID": "UR38909384", "Content": "My adult son and I spent a night here in August 2009.\u00c2\u00a0 Room was decent and spacious.
