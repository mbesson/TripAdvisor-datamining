So far, the Blacket is my pick for places to stay in Sydney. The hotel is central but the rooms are quiet owing to double-glazed windows. A boutique hotel, which used to be an old nineteenth-century bank (ANZ, I think - there are remnants if you look, such as the old saferoom), the rooms are stylish, spacious and very well equipped. The standard prices make this an expensive place to stay, but if you can land one of the hotel's deals it makes all the difference. On this occasion I introduced The Blacket to a couple of sophisticated European business people, and they were very impressed. The service is polite, friendly and capable. I do have some criticisms, however. The place is difficult to find, and if you have a car the parking arrangements are excruciatingly complicated: not for the infirm nor the impatient. And the restaurant (sadly), which used to be good, is now catering to young nightclubbers (think boutique hamburgers etc.), which reminds me - The Blacket also has a heavy-duty nightclub/bar around the corner.

Also when I wanted to leave the next day I was blocked in by another car (the hotel has very limited parking spaces and more cars than they really should), and apparently the staff had forgotten to collect their keys, so I had to wait while they tracked down the owner (who was in his room luckily for me) who came down with the key so I could get out.

Although the reception staff were lovely and very helpful with details about getting around Sydney they were not forthcoming with information other than about breakfast arrangements.We were given a key and left to our own devices to port our luggage and find our room. The mattress was saggy and in need of replacement,the blankets old and felted, the toilet continued to run after being flushed, the soaps were the size of thumbnails and the shower water was not always hot.The heating system rattled noisily.The television was positioned on a bracket on the wall, in such a stupid position, at a height that my companion nearly managed to knock himself out on three times.The complimentary bottle of wine on arrival had to be ordered at reception (which we didn't do) and there was no free bottled drinking water available for international tourists with sensitive stomaches (or us), in the minibar. We probably could have overlooked some of these shortcomings had we not expected a central Sydney CBD boutique hotel experience of at least a minimum standard. Although we kept our room in the hotel on Saturday night we were out until Sunday morning. We were not impressed with the dried vomit on the carpet in the hallway leading to our room when we returned on Sunday morning but were keen to get some sleep after being out all night and ignored it. On Sunday evening we planned to stay in, have an early night and either eat at the inhouse restaurant ''Level Three\"or dial up some room service. It wasn't until Sunday evening we discovered by ringing reception that there was no room service on a Sunday evening and 'Level Three\"was closed to guests due to a private function. The private funtion at Level Three on the floor below us went until 4am on Monday morning, not only depriving us of an inhouse dinner but making it impossible to sleep with the loud, thumping disco music that continued until stumps at 4am.The music and loud inebriated voices pumped through our room like a nightmare depriving us of any chance of sleep. The continental breakfast was an abysmal affair in the cold room that only hours earlier had hosted the private function. The bread like cardboard, inedible even toasted. The handle of one of the two toasters available to the guests fell off in my companions hands as he valiantly tried to cobble a breakfast together.We didn't bother trying to order a decent coffee or eggs a la carte, by that stage we were thoroughly over the contempt the Blacket demonstrates for their guests needs.Staying at the Blacket put me in a very black mood indeed.

I have stayed in the wonderful old Grace hotel, just 40m away, and whilst I like old world charm, it's not worth paying $150 a day more, in my opinion, especially if you're on holiday. That could cover your hire car or cab fares instead. With only 42 rooms, varying from standard to swish suites, it would make sense to book well ahead. I didn't, my travel agent fluked it and I'm glad she did. I will certainly use it again for business and even travelling with the kids - litle legs get very tired after a few hours and you could duck back for a rest and then out again easily. Parking I don't know about but call them. There is a gym nearby apparently too. One unexpected bonus - being a former bank (hence it's central location) it's really very quiet - my room boarded on spooky 'cos it was so hushed so bone up on your conversation skills if travelling with family, there will be few distractions from outside the room. If the cabbie gets lost, tell him / her, \"Take me to the Grace Hotel or the NRMA Tower\" and once there, you'll look up and see the relatively discreet signage.

The hotel itself was very nicely decorated and the loft suite included a small kitchen and a living room with a tv and cd player. The bathroom was spotless and the towels were nice and fluffy. The price was extremely good for the location and room standard.

Very good quality Hotel. It is tucked away and not that well known. I have been to Sydney a few times but had never heard of the Blacket, but once you stay there you will stay again. The rooms are pleasant on the eye and very modern. The standard Deluxe room looks just like the photos posted on the web sites. Good gentle lighting in the rooms/hotel areas Bathroom is also modern and easy on the eye when you look in the mirror!! Very close walking distance to George Street Shopping, Monorail I learnt that you don't neccessarily have to stay at the big well known Hotel chains to enjoy a hotel that has everything you need. Great Value when you book last minute through wotif or other sites.", "Date": "September 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "sydney", "Title": "\u201ctired looking\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3768354", "Content": "this hotel is more than a little scruffy, for the money there are tidier places to stay. the decor and finishes are on the poorer side of ikea. lots of carpet stains not to mention thread bare fabrics and chipped scuffed paint all over the place, cracked and aging grout tiles in the bathroom. time for a refit mr blacket whomever you are! tacky scratched and peeling stickers inside the elevators. what else can i say exept that this made me too scared to contemplate the in house cuisine?!", "Date": "August 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheltenham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel, recommended\u201d", "Author": "Welshmogs", "ReviewID": "UR2809809", "Content": "The hotel is very modern in decor.
