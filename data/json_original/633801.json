Great location within walking distance of Spagna underground station and Spanish Steps. We walked to Trevi Fountain at night too, well lit and felt very safe (with child) - only about 10-15 mins away. You have to book in at Reception at the Condotti Hotel which is around the corner (literally 1 min and not an issue). Our room (318) had the neighbouring room's bathroom built into it, so we heard flushing, showers etc easily through the thin walls. The floors were tiled rather than carpeted, so we heard the people up above too. They do provide lovely Condotti slippers so perhaps that is a hint for people to use them instead of their noisy shoes! People were also very noisy in the hall when arriving and leaving. We used earplugs on the 2nd and 3rd nights! We did request a top floor room (4th floor) but they were booked. It was a good size family room with large modern bathroom. Very nice. Beds were a little too hard for our liking. Double glazed window with shutters overlooking the street. Noise from outside was not a problem. Receptionists were very helpful - we were really impressed with them all. One evening we were treated to a complimentary drink and snacks in the reception area. Free use of internet on a computer in the foyer. Did not try the 10 Euro breakfast. Instead we went to the local supermarket which was 10 mins walk away and got really nice bread, cheese, yogurt, etc for A LOT less. Water is also drinkable in Rome but there are no tea making facilities in the room. We got a taxi from the taxi stand at FCO Airport for 40 Euros which was perfect, rather than paying the 60 Euros quoted by the hotel. Would stay again if the rate was better and would insist on 4th floor room or would try Condotti Hotel(?)", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel!!!\u201d", "Author": "Gal B", "ReviewID": "UR125858734", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and we actually didn't expect to have such a great hotel in this low price.

Only one suggestion; the hotel choice was largely influenced by the location and the availability of WI-FI internet; Two out of the 3 nights, the connection kept shutting down due to overload in capacity.

Its a 30 second walk from the Spanish Steps and in a very nice (and very chic) part of Rome. Innumerable restaurants at your doorstep (quite literally) and small narrow cobblestone streets make the location quaint and fun to explore. Lots of shops (the usual Mango, Prada, etc.). as well as a nearby Carrefour supermarket and a pharmacy (farmacia) within a block or so. The hotel's reception is located around the corner, but its actually much closer than it sounds (30 seconds walk). We literally felt as if we were in the center of all the action. The Trevi Fountain is a 15-20 minute walk in one direction and the Populo Piazza is another 15 minute walk in the opposite direction. The Spagna metro station is a five minute walk from the hotel. We had a double room which, though a bit on the small side, was comfortable, clean and contemporary. A little balcony overlooked a courtyard (we were on the third floor) and a flat screen TV gave the room a newish look. The bathroom was also a bit on the small side but more than made up for it with contemporary furnishings. The bed was quite comfortable and the room was cleaned very well every day during our stay (three nights). The hotel has free Internet, although we were only able to connect at one particular spot in our room (which seems par for the course in most hotels in Rome anyway). There is also a free Internet station in the reception area. Breakfast is available at 10 euros per person every day, but given the hotel's proximity to so many restaurants, we went out to eat for every meal. The folks at the reception were very helpful and friendly and it was a pleasure dealing with them. They were the epitome of professionalism and enhanced the cheerful atmosphere. This is quite a romantic hotel and has a cosy yet contemporary feel about it. We traveled during off-peak season (November) and got an excellent rate through Expedia (particularly given that most hotels in this area go for about 300-500 euros per night). When we checked in. a porter carried our bags and showed us to our room. On checking out, we asked for a cab to the airport and had one waiting outside the hotel less than three minutes after our request. Not bad for 7 AM on a Sunday morning! Overall. a very nice place to stay. We would definitely recommend the place.

It is a block from the Spanish stairs and just where the shopping area begins. So location is perfect. Forum, Coliseum, The Vatican, Fontana di Trevi, and many other sights are within walking distance (<30 min). The room we had was not big but ample. We liked the provided safe and access to Wi-Fi. The room had a nice standard and was spotlessly clean. The tiles on the floor were impressive. There was also a good air conditioning. The beds are on the hard side, which I like. My SO would have preferred them a bit softer. The stairs in the Palace are a bit steep. But there is a lift - but we never used it. The luggage was carried to and from the room by the staff. When we checked out we just left the luggage in the room. And in the evening we came back and collected it in time for our late afternoon flight. The breakfast room is around the corner, in the basement of the hotel. It is really tiny and can be crowded. There is not a huge buffet; there is no room for it. But we have no complaint about the available food. The staff is extremely kind and helpful. And their English is probably better than mine. The only problem we had was with the sound insulation. The hard tiled floors caused a lot of noise when people rolled their luggage in the room upstairs. It woke us up. The same when the restaurants carried out their empty bottles. But booth things happened when we should wake up anyhow. It is a really nice hotel with a great location.

When I bought my house, my real estate agent told me that there are 3 important things to consider: \u201clocation, location and location\u201d \u2013 this is true also when selecting hotels and Condotti hotel is located in an outstanding location \u2013 it is about 2 minutes walking from Spanish Steps and Piazza di Spagna - it means that you are in the center of everything. Since I'm a Platinum member in Priority Club (Inter Continental, Holiday Inn, etc.) I usually stays in IHG hotels, but I couldn't find any good location in Rome - except for Inter Continental which was 3 times more expensive than what we paid, so I decided to book a room in Condotti hotel. I stayed in the hotel with my wife between Nov 3rd to Nov 8th and even though the Spagna metro station is located just 2 minutes from the hotel, we only used it once, neither had to take a taxi. The only time we used the metro was when we went to the Vatican. In the rest of our vacation, we just traveled in the streets and there is no better way to see Rome than by walking in the streets. Since you are in the middle of everything, you just go out and walk. There are also many restaurants in the area and everyone will be able to find a place to eat in his budget (from 5 Euro to 50 Euro per person). We booked a standard room, but were upgraded for free to a junior suite which was great. Cons: The only complaint that I have is that the hotel balcony was allocated on top of our room and at least once I woke in the middle of the night, due to noise from the wood ceiling, since someone was walking there for 10 minutes (probably smoking).", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Shore Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat Staff & Location, Fair Price, Hard Beds, A Little Noisy\u201d", "Author": "NorthShoreLkSup", "ReviewID": "UR120342815", "Content": "Great little hotel in a location that allows you to walk to every major attraction, if you wish.

The annex or \"Palace\" has dark rooms, ugly gross dark blue wall to wall carpet (which is unusal for Italians to have carpet) and just very depressing.. Also, it was a bait and swtich since I had read the reviews and made sure that I had booked at the hotel Condottie not Condotti Palace. I did not want it to happen to me, but it did. They still set me up in the \"annexI\". I could have pitched a fit, but I was too tired and had arrived in the early evening from a long day of travel, plus the front desk guy was rather abrupt.

Just behind the Spanish Steps. We were a party of 8, so we got to see 4 different rooms on the 3rd floor. The rooms are very very small. They were cleaned every day, fresh towels, shampoos etc (we stayed there for 6 days), but the sheets were not changed once and the blanket was very dirty. The bed and pillows were really bad, we couldn't sleep at all on the first night. There isn't a good view of the city and if you're put in one of the back rooms, there is no view at all (see photos). I would say that this hotel is o.k. for really young couples that really don't care much about comfort. We payed \u20ac75/night not including breakfast (that was an extra \u20ac10 per person). Rome has hundreds of cheap hotels, much cheaper than \u20ac75, the problem is that they are all old and run down and filthy. This hotel has been renovated, so it's in much better condition, but the thing is that I'm not 18 years old and this hotel just wasn't enough for me and my husband. If I had to go to Rome again, I would chose to stay just out of the city center where the hotels are much better and cheaper. I would not stay at this hotel again, but I would not go so far as to not recommend it to anyone else. By the way, the pictures in their sight are not exactly fake, but they don't show the real thing.

It was large (by European standards). The bathroom was beautiful and functional: maybe small to some, but perfect for us. The bed was great. My absolute favorite part was the window. It opened to bring in the sounds of the Spanish steps and wonderful air. It had a beautiful view of the beautiful little street. We opened it every night and just stood and took it all in. the room, all in all, was perfect for us. Clean, larger than average, tastefully decorated, functional. The daily breakfast buffet was right in our hallway area so it was very easy. They had juice and pastries and cappuccino\u2026. I found it to be perfect. And the location.

The front desk offered us great ideas for dinner, wonderful suggestions\u2026 and everything was so close. This truly is the best location in Rome, in our opinion.

The only downside of the design of the hotel was that when someone walked above us with hard soled shoes it was very loud. Unfortunately a guest came in the middle of the night in high-heeled shoes and proceeded to walk around for at least 45 mins and made it impossible to sleep.
