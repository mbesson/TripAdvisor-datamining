We arrived after a very long trip (thanks to Air Canada's potential for strike) and my partner's luggage did not arrive with us. We were met by the airport transfer arranged by the hotel (and complimentary with our package) and after a short drive arrived at the hotel. We were immediately greeted by a pleasant young man who offered us a drink, gave us the rundown of the hotel and offered to follow up on the lost luggage. The diligence of the staff continued with this follow up frequently over the next day and the bag eventually was delivered to our room. There were so many fine touches over the course of our stay: A complementary wine and cheese tasting with ample quantities of both; afternoon snacks and tea in the lounge; excellent breakfast buffet every day with lots of delicious coffee; and a comfortable sleep after touring around this fascinating city. The staff greeted us and other guests with courtesy, offered to assist with all our needs, made recommendations for local seafood, and arranged for our transfer back to the airport at the end of our stay. We felt so comfortable and well cared for throughout our stay! Highest complements to the management of this excellent hotel - we will be sure to recommend it to others travelling to Istanbul. Note: as we were staying five nights, we took a package that included many extras including one-way airport transfer, wine & cheese tasting, cooking class (this was missed because we lingered at the Chora Church - a sight not to be missed), and first night dinner in the restaurant next door.

I was initially dubious by the offer of 11% discount if I paid in cash, but I am glad I did as this is a significant discount. I have no idea why they offer such a large discount for cash - perhaps Turkish banks have expensive transaction rates - whatever the reason I recommend taking this offer.

We booked our hotel for three nights in the least expensive category. We felt that after substantial jet lag and just getting acclimated it would not make any difference where we stayed.

It had a beautiful view facing the Topkapi Gardens, On the terrace we had a beautiful panarama of the city and a view of the Bosphorous Sea. The room was immaculate and thoroughly cleaned each day.

One could not ask for a better location. The tram was a few blocks away as well. If you need to make arrangements to other parts of Turkey there is a travel agency, Volare, right across the street . Their prices were fair and the owner was very competent. He arranged a lot of land tours for us while we were in other parts of the country. The agency can also assist with local venues in Istanbul. By the time we were about to leave the hotel, we felt as though we were a family member. We have stayed at high end hotels around the world.

We stayed for 3 nights between x-mas and new year. To start with, we were given a transfer from the airport free of charge. The check-in was hassle free even though we came very early in the morning. We were offered breakfast and were given information on the city by Summit, from the hotel staff. We had booked a superior room but were upgraded to a deluxe one as there was no availability of a superior. The room was huge, with a jaccuzzi and a balcony with views on the gardens of Top Kapi and the Bosporous. One morning, after housekeeping, we found the bed made up with real flowers scattered on the sheets! What a touch! Breakfast was very good, (orange juice was freshly squeezed), the variety of breads being my top favourite as they bake their own bread on the premises. On the first night we had dinner in one of the hotel's restaurants which was included in the price we had paid for our stay. Very nice! Of course the location of the hotel is excellent, we didn't use public transport at all, everything, the sights, the restaurants, the grand bazaar are within walking distance. The hotel also organises activities like cooking classes and tours, we chose the walking tour to the fruit market and the greek area which was guided by Okay, one of the hotel's receptionists. A special thanks to all the staff each one of whom were polite, cheerful and warm. If we go again to Istanbul, which I hope, we won't look further than this hotel!

We stayed for 4 nights in middle of December. The most notable thing was the very friendly and helpful staff that made our stay very pleasant. They gave us advice on what to visit, where to eat, and where to buy things. The free guided tour organized by the hotel was also one of our favorite events in istanbul, when our tour guide Agah took us and several other guests to a side of istanbul that tourists could only see with a local guide. Additionally, I asked Agah about different restaurants that I read about on istanbuleats dot com and he highly recommended Zubeyir (grill house) and he reserved a table for us. Agah made sure we have a great experience at the restaurant as he reserved a table for us next to the grill where I sat almost next to the chef as he prepared my food. Agah prepared a special menu for us with a really delicious selection of food. When we arrived at the hotel, they not only checked us in, but sat us down with a complimentary tea and described to us the major attractions of Istanbul on a map. Our room on the 1st floor was very nice and clean with wooden floors. There was a dish of turkish delight waiting for us in our room which we really enjoyed =) The hotel has a small pool, sauna, and turkish bath. We didn't bring our bathing suits so we did not use the pool, but they provided towels that we could use in the sauna and turkish bath. A very nice man from the hotel staff showed us how to do the turkish bath properly as it was our first time. For breakfast, they had a very extensive selection of food that we enjoyed. They also had a nice selection of different teas. From 4:30 to 6:30 pm they offer complimentary drinks, but there was so much to do in Istanbul we never had time to come back. The hotel is centrally located in the historical district of istanbul, right next to a tram stop that can take you easily into the european part of istanbul. It is ~ 10 min walk to topkapi palace, ~15 min to hagia sophia, and ~20 min to blue mosque. It is ~ 15 min to Eminou dock where you can take the bosphorous tour or ferries to other parts of istanbul. When we left the hotel they gave us a complimentary gift including turkish delight, apple tea, and candies. I recommend figuring out where they buy their turkish delight because the ones we purchased for our family back home were not as delicious. I highly recommend staying at Konak. They staff will help you with anything and will suggest things for your trip that will really make it memorable, you should take advantage of this if you stay here! Additionally I also recommend going on their free guided tours which really shows you a side of Istanbul that a normal tourist doesn't see. I also recommend going to Zubeyir grill house (~130 TL for 2 ppl with 3 appetizers, 3 mains, and red wine). Another restaurant recommended to us by the hotel was Asitane restaurant which was also one of our favorite restaurants. It is next to the chora church which has nice mosaics. The restaurant specializes in ancient ottomon cuisine (~110 TL for 2 ppl with 2 appetizers and 2 mains). Other information that might be useful to you: We arrived at SAW airport and took the havatas bus to karikoy dock (8TL) and a ferry to eminou dock (2TL). From the dock it is walkable to the hotel ~ 15 min. You can also take the tram 2 stops as well. Another option is to take the havas or havatas bus (two different companies) to taksim square, take the funicular (its underground), and then take the tram to the hotel. Both options are quite easy and the people of istanbul are very friendly if you get lost (though they may not be able to speak english).", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel Amazing Room\u201d", "Author": "erinjilek", "ReviewID": "UR122077555", "Content": "Very nice and original place to stay.

The airport transfer was great as the chaos at the airport was a little more than I wanted to handle after traveling 24 hours from California. Upon our arrival we were notified of being upgraded to one of their Balcony rooms (2501). We then enjoyed complimentary beverages in the lounge area while they summarized the top tourist attractions, discussed the extra offerings of the hotel and familiarized us with transportation and a map of the city. Of the Hotel's extra complimentary offerings, we signed up for walking tour in the fatih market, the wine and cheese pairing and the cooking class. We participated and enjoyed all the extras. We thought this was a nice touch and made a difference in our stay. We also enjoyed 2 dinners at their restaurants, both of which were comparable to trip advisors top choices for istanbul.

This time, I chose a room with a shower - re mobility issues- and it was perfect. My room overlooked Gulhane Park, with a tiny balcony and a window box with flowers. As it was the first week in November and not too cold, I never turned the heating on, and left my window open most of the time. The room was average sized, with a king-sized bed, a chair, and an upholstered stool to sit upon. The bed was very comfortable, and had an array of pillow types from which to chose. I had no issue with noise, but, I do travel with a White Noise machine, as I am sensitive to sound. The bath was adequately sized, and this time, I used the towel warmer, ...a treat for me. The bath products were the spa-type, with different scented soaps. As I am fairly short, the towel shelf was - literally - a bit of a stretch for me. Breakfast is an adventure, with both familiar and different dishes. Although many cereals and toppings were on offer, they paled compared to the Turkish breakfast items available. The dishes are freshly prepared, and tasty. Spinach and cheese borek, little balls of cheese rolled in a mild red ground pepper, or in sesame seeds. Different kinds of olives, and breakfast breads. Scrambled eggs, some sort of bacon, and other items I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve forgotten. Croissants and other bread items to toast to your liking. I made sure I went to breakfast first, then got dressed for the day, in order to have an appetite for lunch. The hotel thoughtfully offers dinner the first night as part of the room charge, as many guests are exhausted from the long flight. I availed myself of this option, and ate at the fish restaurant. The fish soup could have been paired with a salad, to make a meal in itself. I chose the sea bass - grilled, which was accompanied by mesclun salad greens, in the lightest lemony vinaigrette imaginable. Both the fish and the salad were wonderful. I passed on dessert. Guests never go hungry at the Sirkeci Konak. Tea is offered in the afternoon, with tasty little sandwiches on simit bread rings. Many of the guests partake, and enjoy the conversations which spring up. The hotel location is perfect - 50 m from the tram stop at Gulhane Park. Tokens for the tram are available at the desk, Guest relations spend time with each guest upon arrival, offering maps and information, and answering your questions about the hotel, and the city.

In reality the hotel is perfectly located if you want to visit the main attractions, namely the Topkapi Palace, the Agia Sophia, the Blue Mosque and the Grand Bazaar.All are within a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. The double room we had on the first floor faced onto the road which was relatively quiet.The room could ideally have been a little bigger but this was not a problem.

We decided to have dinner in the hotel on the first night at the Neyzade restaurant and this was so good we had dinner the following night in the hotel's adjoining Balikcisi seafood restaurant. I recommend you have dinner at least once in both restaurants because it will be hard to find better quality/value elsewhere. Also make sure you make a reservation well in advance because both restaurants were full on the night we ate there with many diners coming from outside the hotel. Breakfast in the hotel was fine with a good choice. Outside the hotel the Imbat restaurant, in the Orient Express Hotel (part of the same Hotel Group) and only a few hundred yards way, is also excellent and highly recommended for dinner or lunch. From its 7th floor the Imbat restaurant has great views over the city and Bosphorus. All the staff in the Sirkeci Konak hotel were very welcoming and friendly and keen to offer advice or assistance, and their standard of service could not be faulted.

I was not disappointed, in fact, I was totally impressed by the outstanding service, friendliness of the staff, the hotels warm ambience and also its perfect location to all the tourist sites in Istanbul, yet it is in a side street away from the hustle and bustle of the city traffic. Everything is within walking distance however, the tram stop for those who wish to travel further afield, is less than 75 metres away. Truely a perfect place to stay in Istanbul and without the hefty price tag of many other hotels. My room was spacious, compared to European standards, nicely furnished in a more traditional way, and included a small balcony overlooking the Topkapi Palace walls and gardens. The bathroom was excellent and the internet was free in the lobby - and included wifi in all rooms. The restaurant on the rooftop was wonderful with extensive views of the city, Bosphoros, Topkapi Palace and local area and with an excellent menu and wine list - all at very reasonable prices. There is also a seafood restaurant within the hotel on the ground floor level. One-way transfer to or from the airport is included in the room price. As a retired Flight Purser who has travelled the world for more than 40 years, I have stayed in some of the best and worst hotels. This is one of the nicest boutique hotels I have had the pleasue of staying in and I can thoroughly recommend it for those who don't wish to stay in the Hiltons, Sheratons and Holiday Inns. I was made to feel like part of the family - important as a single traveller. Tip 1. If this hotel if full - try their sister hotel, the Neorion Hotel - equally good. Tip 2. Make sure you know where the hotel is as many Taxi drivers are unaware of the location - it is about 75 metres from the Gulhane tram stop and within easy walking distance if the Taxi drops you at this tram stop.

This is a wonderful hotel in a prime location and with the most friendly staff. Here are the highlights and my comments: Highlights: 1. Staff - The warm, friendly staff provide amazing service and are one of the main reasons this hotel is so highly rated. Having never been to Istanbul before, I emailed ahead and inquired about airport transportation from IST to the hotel. I received a prompt response with various options, rates, and next steps on how to proceed. The hotel booked a car and when I cleared the baggage claim, my driver was waiting. As soon as I got into the car, I was handed a brochure on the hotel along with some helpful hints about visiting Istanbul. The driver was very friendly and was pointed out sights along the way. Once we arrived at the hotel, I was promptly greeted by the Guest Service manager who escorted me to the check-in desk and offered me a beverage of my choice as they checked me in. It was almost as if she was personally awaiting my arrival. My bags were delivered to my room and in the room there was a dish of turkish delight waiting. Throughout my stay, the members of the staff were always smiling, kind, and very friendly offering \"Hello\" and \"How are you, sir?\", when walking through the hotel. They were always willing and happy to answer any questions or assist with anything that I needed including arranging transportation and helping me get to various parts of town. When I did check out and leave, the front desk staff on duty walked me out to the waiting car and handed me a goodbye gift and each personally said their goodbyes. This was a nice, personal touch that I will most remember. 2. Service - Based on the above, I see staff and service as almost one - both amazing. I did have one minor issue while staying at the hotel and when I informed the staff they promptly resolved the issue and also exceeded my expectations in the resolution. A measure of excellent service in my opinion is not just how a person or team conduct themselves when things go well, but also to the how they address and resolve issues when they do arise. In the area of Service, I give the Sirkeci Konak the highest rating. 3. Location - The Sirkeci Konak is located within easy walking distance of the Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, the wonderful Sultanahmet neighborhood, and the Bosporus. I was able to walk everywhere. There are many, many sidewalk cafes and restaurants within easy walking distance. 4. Value - The room was comfortable and clean. Breakfast was included which also added to the value.

From the tea, sandwiches,apples available in their lobby to their delicious breakfast we were delighted. The rooms are typically Turkish style but spotlessly clean and very comfortable. We had a charming room with a balcony overlooking the Palace gardens. Restaurants were recommended, booked and asked about when we returned to make sure that we were satisfied with their choices. We were taken on a private complimentary tour of the diamond setting and gold pouring workshops through markets and places where most people would not bother to go to. We unfortunately missed the cooking class that was offered but have heard those that attended enjoyed it tremendously. The roof patio is very attractive with a restaurant weather permitting overlooking the Palace Gardens and the Mamara Sea. We used the Turkish Baths and pool (although it is deep and I could not stand) and were glad to experience the service. The hotel is situated in a great location next to a tram stop, within walking distance to all the major attractions in the old city and close to the bridge to cross to the European side.

There are a variety of activities at the hotel that are offered at no additional charge to guests. We par took of the meze tasting which was not only delicious but most informative about the culture and customs of Turkey. The meze offerings were more than enough to satisfy any dinner hunger. We also took a cooking class and enjoyed the meal we prepared. In addition they offer if you book on line a free dinner at the hotel and transport from the airport to the hotel. The rooms are well appointed although some might say small, but who cares there is no time to spend in the room when Istanbul awaits. Welcoming you when you arrive or stop to take a break is a dish of fantastic Turkish Delight that magically lasted our entire stay. The breakfast buffet was large and we never got bored with the offerings. Fresh and high quality food. Also it would be remiss not to mention the fantastic location.

We chose to stay in the Sultanhamet district since I knew we'd want to be doing a lot of walking to the major historical sites on this first trip to Istanbul. I made my decision on the reviews I had read on this hotel and was not disappointed. Staff are very friendly and helpful. We splurged on the bigger room with king bed, top 4th floor with a private terrace. The room was VERY spacious and had a couch that could have likely been used for a single bed. The bathroom was modernized with nice ceramic wall tile and 2 showers (one stall and one in the tub). The room itself had a nice authenitic Turkish feel. I did not think we'd have time to use the private balcony...but I was wrong. All 3 days when we arrived back to the hotel around 5pm we enjoyed sitting outside, with a view of the park next door and/or looking down below at the side street activity. Each morning I woke up, I also went on the balcony for a bit and could see the Bosphorus in the other direction distance...the cruise ships docked. The tramway line was at the corner so convenient although we never used it. I found the area to be very quiet in the evening...the front entrance is located on a side street. We enjoyed a supper at their fish restaurant next door and also a roof top dinner at the sister hotel restaurant, Imbat, on our first evening which was excellent. Prices were all reasonable in my opinion. My only complaint with the room is the fact that the king bed did not really have a true king \"flat\" cover sheet....it wasn't long enough and easily got untucked from the bed. We got used to it the 2nd night but perhaps something that could be improved. It is almost as though the sheet was made for a Queen bed. The quality of the bedding though was very good. The breakfast was very good. The day time concierge was excellent in helping us each day in getting my plans sorted out. He always pointed us in the right direction, made our dinner reservations each evening and suggested a wonderful Nargile place not too far from the Grand Bazaar to experience a more \"local\" place to experience a smoking pipe and some tea. Thanks to all the team for making our 3-day stay in Istanbul a pleasurable experience. P.S. if you are looking to take out Euros at an ATM machine...try the HSBC machine near Hagia Sophia ...we tried several in different locations to no avail but this one worked with our Royal Bank Canadian debit card. The hotel will give you an 11% discount if you pay cash so it was worth looking for one.

You'll need help to get around, to pick the best trips and pick up the best tips and somewhere to relax and unwind after a day out and about. And Sirkeci Konak is exactly that place. My wife and I have just come back from nine amazing days in Istanbul to celebrate our first wedding anniversary and would recommend this hotel to anyone planning to visit. From the minute you step through the front door they can't do enough to help you. The hotel itself is situated in a really good spot. Just a couple of minutes away from some of the main sights, such as Topkapi Palace and the Blue Mosque, but equally not in the most touristy area. That means less hassle from the sellers and restaurateurs and less noise in the evening. The rooms are fairly standard in terms of size, but decked out in a very warm Turkish inspired style. But it's everything else about the hotel that makes it so amazing. Firstly the staff. It seems the owners of this group, which owns a handful of hotels in the city, have carefully handpicked the staff who work here. Each one is always cheerful, always friendly, very knowledgeable and so helpful. And rather than just have people who man the front desk, the hotel employs several members of staff whose job is simply to provide advice and guidance. When we arrived we were immediately sat down by one of them and given a lowdown of where was best to go and when and how. It was interesting to learn later in the holiday, when chatting to one of the staff members, that they are given amazing levels of freedom from their bosses to go above and beyond for guests. When we arrived there was a 'Happy Anniversaries' (sic) note in our room, along with a fruit bowl and bottle of red wine. We also received a free meal at their fish restaurant and a box of Turkish Delight as a leaving gift. Speaking of the restaurant, this is part of what also makes this place so special - the extras it offers. It has two, very nice and very reasonably priced restaurants, one which doubles up as a picturesque roof top bar, a gym, swimming pool, sauna and Turkish bath, which offer the much-needed chance to unwind. But also they offer around half a dozen complimentary experiences, of which we made sure we did five - and loved every single one. These included a market tour, Turkish afternoon tea, Turkish wine and cheese tasting, Raki tasting and a Turkish cookery class. We couldn't believe our luck when not only did we get to cook a Turkish meal with one of the head chefs, but the group were then sat down at the end of the lesson and allowed to enjoy the meal in full. Meanwhile the 5pm Raki tasting heralded the start of what became a very drunken, but very good, last night! Istanbul is very expensive (but worth every penny) so to get the chance to enjoy these things for free makes a real difference to the holiday. Price wise, this hotel is not the cheapest (it's not the most expensive either) but it's no exaggeration to say that it was worth every penny. I can't see how any hotel in Istanbul could better this one - and that pretty much says all you need to know.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSimply the Best!\u201d", "Author": "WLandJH", "ReviewID": "UR118552283", "Content": "We stayed in the Sirkeci Konak hotel for 5 nights in early September 2011.

Hotel itself-Well, wow. I've stayed in a few somewhat fancy hotels but never encountered such kind and genuine hospitality (without over intrusion) as experienced here. The staff were always willing to facilitate, professional and very helpful with directions, guides and recommendations. And the hotel itself didn't have that underhanded \"I want to charge you for everything\" feel that you get at so many places. Probably the best collection of staff I've met in any hotel. The decor itself is quite tasteful and understated, the bedrrom was more than nice with a great bed and lovely extra touches here and there. The only thing I would say is that the bathroom was alittle small, so if you like your space, get a bigger room. In spite of that, the bedroom was lovely with a little balcony overlooking the street below where you can stand drinking coffee in the morning and be a nosy neigbour watching the family run shops open up in the morning and the shopkeepers sit on the street playing backgammon just living life at a leisurely pace.

I have to admit that I had reservations about traveling with our two young kids, ages 7 and 10, when there are some obvious tensions in the world. However, my worries were completely unfounded and our time in Istanbul could not have been nicer. We really enjoyed being there, and a large part that was due to our stay at the Sirkeci Konak. In addition to being one of the nicest hotels that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever been in, the people there made us feel incredibly welcome from the get-go. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend this place enough, and we loved it so much that we stayed there on the final leg of our trip, as well. It made our stay in Istanbul so special that I personally can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to go back. I know I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not alone. The hotel arranged transportation to and from the city, and that made things easier because trying to get a taxi in the big city is always a bit of a chore. You never really know if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re being taken, especially if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak the language. We were ideally located in the heart of the old section of Istanbul, within walking distance to the river, countless restaurants, shops, and many of the sites that visitors will want to check out, including the Hagia Sofia and the Blue Mosque. There is a really nice park directly across the, and we arrived during some sort of massive tulip blooming whose colors were amazing. Really beautiful, and a nice introduction to the city. The hotel offers tours of the city, as well as cooking classes. How cool is that? They can also arrange for transportation throughout the city, and the light rail passes within 100 feet of the hotel. I highly recommend walking and taking the train. The helpful people at the front desk can help you with every aspect of this, and offer plenty of helpful advice on where to go. The hotel itself was amazing, and the rooms were very clean and simply beautiful. We could have spent our entire time inside, though we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually a resort and spa, so people go there for a romantic getaway or to just be pampered (not our thing). They have a pool, sauna, gym, and a spa where you can get a massage or have a Turkish bath. We spent a lot of time with the kids in the pool and Turkish bath after a day of exploring the city. The food was awesome. When you travel with kids, you really have to think about things like safety and comfort, and part of that is knowing where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to eat, because kids can be picky. The restaurant at the Sirkeci Konak had incredible food and the service was impeccable, though maybe a little upscale and sophisticated to eat ever day. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to wake up just so we could go and eat at the breakfast buffet, which was very elegant and had a wonderful selection of foods, including freshly made bread and pastries, eggs and breakfast meats, fresh fruit, and all sorts of nuts and sweet treats. They really do a nice job with the food, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an experience in and of itself. Again, the service is amazing. There was an afternoon tea time which was nice transition into supper. The guests in the hotel sit together and chat, or you can choose to simply sit quietly and enjoy your tea, either black tea or apple tea. They also serve complimentary sandwiches, or you can order any sort of beverage or cocktail, and there is a light food menu. We really felt at home, an important consideration when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re with your kids. Despite the fact that the hotel is a resort/spa, the kind of place where people normally seek out elegance and refinement, they were very warm to our family and really enjoyed having our kids there. FYI, they love children Istanbul, and showered our kids with attention and even small but thoughtful gifts. I could go on for days about how much we loved Istanbul and the Sirkeci Konak. What a wonderful place to visit, and I honestly can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to go back. The dollar is still relatively strong to the Turkish lira, about 2:1, so you can get good deals. Definitely check out the big sites, including the spice market and grand bazaar. I actually met a family from New Hampshire at the spice market. When we sadly had to leave, the staff at the hotel all came out to the lobby to say goodbye, and I felt like I was leaving part of my family behind. They even gave us a departing gift, which really made the trip special. Istanbul is a big cosmopolitan city that is culturally unique, and a great middle ground between Europe and Asia. There is a push to gain entry into the EU, so they are working hard at being taken seriously on a global scale, and I think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve accomplished it.

This was our second visit to this beautiful country. We had fallen in love with its people and culture 2 years ago and this time decided to stay at the Sirkeci Konak. I, along with thousands of others had read the reviews, the accolades the Sirkeci receives. And I confess I did wonder: are they true or inflated as I suspect some reviews may be. Our experience supports the former. In our travels we have stayed at many beautiful hotels and some whose reputation for service is also well deserved. However where Sirkeci excels is in its philosophy of service and hospitality offering guests an authentic taste of Turkish life. Whether it's the efficiency of the dining room servers, the willingness of front desk staff to help with your itinerary or the encouragement to participate in their activities, the emphasis on service comes first. Upon arrival at Ataturk we were met by our driver and driven to the Sirkeci, compliments of the hotel. Even though our jet lagged bodies didn't want to cooperate, we were anxious to settle in and explore this beautiful city. The reception we received was wonderful. We were immediately invited to sit in a comfortable sitting area nearby and offered our choice of refreshments. Soon after we found ourselves relaxing on the balcony of our lovely 5th floor suite overlooking Gulhane Park watching ships as they moved along the Bosphorus. A lovely fruit basket, a bottle of wine and a dish of Turkish Delight had been placed on the table. Our room was quite comfortable and we enjoyed a glass of wine on the balcony each evening before dinner. The Sirkeci had thought of everything to make our anniversary a special celebration. By the time we had settled in it was getting late, jet lag was taking its toll and we were hungry. In the dining room we enjoyed a very nice 4 course dinner which was also complimentary if you stayed at least 3 nights. On our first visit 2 years ago we had discovered how much we loved the flavors of Turkish cuisine and the meals at Sirkeci didn't disappoint. The next day we attended the free 45 minute cooking class in their immaculate kitchen ... more demo than class ... but it was great fun. There were 7 of us and under the direction of our female chef we chopped and sliced till we had finished an appetizer and main course. Afterwards we were led to the dining room where we tucked into our culinary creations. With the chef's help we had created an entirely edible meal! On Wednesday morning we decided to take advantage of the market excursion and after breakfast were driven to a traditional Turkish neighborhood. Okay, our guide, was very knowledgeable about Turkish history, culture and politics and as we strolled through the neighborhood streets he told stories, pointed out historical sites and patiently answered our many questions. What a super guy! At one point, we stopped and briefly visited a tiny but beautiful mosque. For most of the morning we wandered about taking pictures, tasting treats and buying souvenirs in the busy market nearby. Later, after stopping at a local bakery to buy some traditional breads, we took a short ferry ride back to our own neighborhood and enjoyed lunch in a typical Turkish restaurant patronized by locals. Before returning to our hotel Okay invited us to visit a sister hotel just minutes away from the Sirkeci which had opened the week before. After a cup of apple tea in the public room he showed us one of the bedrooms and we then headed back to the Sirkeci. In contrast to the Sirkeci this hotel was of contemporary design but also quite nice. It will undoubtedly have the same philosophy as its sister hotels ... one of superior service to its guests. Our market tour was fabulous, an authentic taste of Turkish life we might never have discovered had it not been so generously offered. Many, many thanks to our guide and friend, Okay. You made an ordinary day very special indeed. As anyone who has stayed at the Sirkeci Konak knows, it's their service that's truly outstanding and we thank the staff for their kindness during our visit. It really does deserve its exceptional reputation. I have only described a small portion of what the Sirkici has to offer ... there's lots more. Check it out. You won't be disappointed. Unfortunately our visit ended on a sad note ... we didn't want to leave. I'm beginning to research our next trip now and trying to figure out the route ... via Istanbul.

Enjoyed an excellent (and FREE) session with the hotel's chef, trying out some local cooking in the hotel kitchens. Very reassuring when a hotel is confident enough about its hygene standards to allow guests to come and see the staff at work. Although food was excellent you are so close to the main heart of the city there are lots of other restaurants nearby - so only had one meal at the hotel except for breakfasts which were substantial and avoided the need for eating much at lunchtime! One small tip: Forget the tourist cruises - simply catch the ferry with all the locals across to Kadikoy. Not much to see there but as 30 minute ferry costs just 1.75 TL, it is fantastic value and gives a great view of the old city from the sea.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Noosaville, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAn experience to remember and recorded in our travel diaries\u201d", "Author": "beans070", "ReviewID": "UR116238907", "Content": "We have travelled from Patagonia to Odessa.

We had selected this hotel on the basis of previous reviews - for which thanks - and were not diasappointed. The excellent service started even before we arrived and had to change our travel plans from a train journey to a flight from Izmir. An email to the concierge was all it took to have a complimentary car waiting for us at the airport. After being shown our room and given time tofreshen-up we were treated to a warm welcome, apple tea and explanatory talk from the charming duty manager. Complimentary afternoon tea and cake is served to guests every afternoon. There are also free events like backgammon lessons, which my wife enjoyed, and treats for a minor fee - like a genuine Turkish bath and massage. The hotel is in a fantastic location, very near the Topkapi Palace, and an easy walk or short tram ride to the principal mosques, the bazaar and other historic attractions. Don't miss a visit to the Byzantine cistern that featured in one of the Bond films (can't recall which one). The rooms are not huge but neither are they too small. We were given adjoining rooms with a shared internal door so we could share spave with our children. Everything was very clean and well-maintained on a daily basis. The food is very good. The breakfast buffet is extensive, varied and plentiful. Afternoon tea is a delight. We ate at various city restaurants most evenings but we had dinner on the hotel roof terrace one evening and it was a very enjoyable experience. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Top tip is to be ready to pay in cash (Turkish lira or Euros) as you will get a significant discount off your bill. We really enjoyed our sightseeing holiday in Istanbul.

There was a cooking class on Turkish cuisine, which was a lot of fun and we got to eat the food afterwards; there was a cheese and wine tasting and best of all, a four hour guided tour of a Farmers Market and a delightful part of Istanbul on that we would never otherwise have seen. This was led by the charming and highly professional manager, Mr Agah, a man dedicated to looking after his guests. We also made some good friends through these shared experiences.

These rooms were impeccably clean and well-decorated. The roof patio was great for a little early evening drink with my husband before dinner. We tried both restaurants and preferred the fish one on the ground floor. Breakfast is copious and there is something for everyone's taste. The wellness area is a plus; steam bath, sauna, and pool. We took advantage of it every day before dinner and it was fantastic. The staff is extremely welcoming in helpful and made our stay in Istanbul that much more special. The only thing that did not run smoothly is that the (complimentary) driver was not there when we got out of the arrivals door at the airport but after one quick call to the hotel he managed to find us and we were on our way to the hotel within about 15 mins waiting. A minor glitch that did not affect us in any way. In summary, I can say that I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again should we ever return to Istanbul.

I will admit that when we first arrived there, I wasn't totally wowed because the lobby struck me as a little \"old school\" compared to the more modern designer boutique hotels we usually stay at (plus, the airport transfer we'd arranged through the hotel had been kind of flaky, so I wasn't in the best of moods at that point). But once we started interacting with the very helpful staff and saw our beautiful room (Deluxe Room w/ balcony on the top floor), we were convinced we'd selected the right place to stay in Istanbul. After walking the hectic streets of Istanbul every day, our room came to feel like a tranquil oasis that we looked forward to escaping to. It helped that our terrace overlooked Gulhane Park, where Topkapi Palace is, so instead of looking down at noisy traffic and crowds, we gazed at lush greenery, as well as the Golden Horn in the distance. The hotel location is perfect. It's centrally located to all of the major tourist sights (Aya Sofia, Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar), but it's on a quiet side street, so as soon as you round the corner and see the hotel, it's almost like you're in a totally different city. And as I mentioned before, the service is exceptional. Nearly every staff member we came across went out of their way to assist us. I'd also like to strongly recommend the hotel's spa services. On our last day we both booked the 90-minute Sultan's Massage, consisting of a scrub-down with an exfoliating brush, a thorough lathering-up with soap, and an oil massage. What a perfect way to end our trip! And the rooftop restaurant is great...amazing views and very good food. We never tried the hotel's seafood restaurant on the first floor (because we always wanted to dine al fresco), but it's supposed to be very good as well. My one quibble with the hotel was its breakfast. Out of the four hotels we stayed at during our trip (the other three in Greece), this hotel's breakfast offerings were probably the weakest. Much of it was standard continental breakfast fare, but many of the pastries and breads were stale and the fruit selection was pretty lackluster. But maybe I was just desperately craving a huge bowl of healthy oatmeal and fruit after three weeks of scrambled eggs, sausage, and yogurt. But the breakfast was just one minor hitch in an otherwise exceptional hotel experience.

I cannot say enough about my wonderful experience at this hotel. After sailing from Athens to Istanbul we arrive at the hotel quite early in the morning. We were greeted with the biggest of smiles and warmest of welcomes. Since the room was not ready, due to the early arrival, they kept our bags for us and gave us information of where to find the double decker tour bus we wanted to get an overview of the city. It was our first time in Istanbul and we really had no idea of what to expect. We were blown away by the incredible hospitality of the people in the city, but the staff in the hotel took the cake in that department. Thye really do treat you like family and they made us feel doted on: no request was too small or too big. It is their absolute pleasure to help you with whatever you might need. In fact, they gave us a larger room than the one I originally booked. We paid cash and got an 11% discount. We were there for 2 days and 2 nights. Both nights we ate at the restaurants of the hotel family where we enjoyed the 10% discount. They were both in easy and short walking distance to the hotel. The meals were great with wonderful service! The hotel is in an excellent location. To be honest, I booked this hotel largely due to Trip Advisor reviews and their #2 Recommended Hotel status on the site. I didn't really have the time to research ideal locations, etc... Well, I can tell you my husband was praising me up, down, left and right on my choice of hotel. He couldn't believe how well we were located to the major sights. Our room overlooked the Topkapi gardens and the entrance is steps away. The Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, Basilica Cistern are all within an easy walk. As well, there is a tram (street car) stop steps from the hotel. The tram is about $1.65/ride and can take you all around where you need to go. There is a subway but we didn't get a chance to use it since everything was so accessible by foot, in the main. I can't recommend the city and the hotel enough. We were very sad to leave and I wished I could take some of the staff home with me; The people there have really taught me a lot about hospitality. Istanbul is completely safe and buzzing with energy. It is larger that NYC and busier. There is commerce going on in every nook and cranny. Fascinating! Don't be bothered by people who start talking to you randomly; they probably have a store they would like to show you. I usually hate that sort of thing, but these people are not pushy and they will listen if you tell them that you just aren't interested.

After booking the staff was most helpful with information about getting to the hotel from the port. We were told to just catch a cab and were even told what we should be charged. This was helpful as the cab driver initially wanted twice what we were told is appropriate. Upon arrival we had a staff member give us detailed tour information-set us on our way . She was so helpful we couldn't believe it-and she was not trying to sell us anything! We walked to all of the main sites-all easy walking distance from this hotel-some both during the day and at night to see them in lights as well. The first night we were given a complimentary meal in the hotel restaurant-the food was excellent-traditional Turkish fare. We enjoyed the sauna, pool , and Turkish bath each afternoon before dinner-very nice facilities. On our departure day the hotel set us up a shuttle at 4 am-we were surprised they were so willing to do this at such an early hour but we had a 6 am flight.

The location of the hotel is difficult for many of the Istanbul taxi drivers to find. However, it is well situated for seeing some of the major historic sites of Istanbul.

Breakfast was an increadible spread with freshly baked breads, local cheeses, fresh fruit, yoghurts and freshly squeezed juices. What was most remarkable was the hospitality of the front desk staff. Restaurant advice was great and reservations and transportation arranged flawlessly. Staff go the extra mile to make sure guest are taken care of. One staff member took us with another couple on a tour of the Fatih Wednesday market and then through some neighborhoods off the beaten tourist track winding up with a ferry ride back to the hotel stopping for lunch in a local kebab house. Our last night we requested a really authentic restaurant where locals go. The owner of the Sirkeci Group which owns the hotel on his way home dropped us at one of his personal favorites which was a family restaurant with regional cuisine from a part of Turkey near Syria.

Their policy of \"GUEST MEANS EVERY THING\" is lived and breathed by every member of staff, who are all utterly delightful and helpful. We reserved a standard room for 4 nights, and wished we could have extended our stay. Our room (1107) was not large, but there was sufficient space to store two large suitcases on luggage racks, and spacious built in cupboards with plenty of draws and hanging space. We had a lounge and a desk with a chair. Free wifi throughout the hotel had a strong signal, and there were computers in the lobby for guests to access at no cost. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the pillow menu was excellent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a choice of silicon, plume, ergonomic, orthopaedic, or visco-elastic. The location is superb \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on a small quiet street in Sirkeci just 50 metres from the Gulhane tram station and within easy walking distance to just about everything in the old city. The area is undergoing lovely gentrification, with paved brick streets. We were offered a free dinner on our first night and weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting much. We were blown away \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the best meal so far, and we had been in Turkey for 16 days!!. We had a starter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 3 types of rolls with delicious olive oil and hummus, and were told we could choose any entree, main and dessert from the extensive menu! We chose a large vegetarian mezze plate (15 TL) and the pan fried, marinated sliced eggplants with cheese and fresh herbs and yoghurt (11 TL) to share; and had now had elegant sufficiency; followed by the fish (a huge grilled sea bass, which my travelling companion, who is very picky, described as 'superb\", accompanied by a large rocket and tomato salad with other bits and pieces (23 TL), and grilled meat balls on an eggplant dip sprinkled with parsley (20 TL) served with what looked a bit like Israeli couscous. We were now bursting but my friend decided to sample 2 desserts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c wedding helva (semolina havla cooked with orange and walnut and served with home made ice cream (7.5 TL), and soft dried apricots stuffed with fresh almonds, also with ice cream (7 TL). We had a large bottle of San Pellegrino and 2 glasses of wine each \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all we paid for! Breakfasts at the hotel were plentiful and fresh. The only missing ingredient was eggs \"cooked to order\", but I'm sure if one asked, that wouldn't be a problem. We signed up for the free cooking class, held on Monday afternoons, and the free trip to a local market, held on Wednesdays. We went to our cooking class at 5 pm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down to the spotless kitchen where we donned white gowns, chef\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assistants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hats and rubber gloves. I had expected a demonstration, but no, it was hands on participation! We each had our bench space, chopping board and a large sharp knife. Our menu was Kisir and Kuzu Kavurma. Our first goal was to chop parsley and spring onions, then onions and tomatoes, then green peppers, and finally diced lamb. The chef did the rest of the preparation. Unfortunately, I managed to cut through my glove when chopping the onion, and we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the piece of chopped rubber, so my portion of the onion had to be discarded!! When the dishes were prepared, we were led to the dining room to be seated, offered the wine list, and served our food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c piping hot!!!! So, we have enjoyed another free dinner, but, to be honest, our own cooking wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a patch on the previous night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offerings! On Wednesday morning at 10.30 am, we met Okay (pronounced Okai) from the Front Desk and Aylin from Guest Relations in the lobby, and with 3 other guests, were transported to Fatih and dropped near the Fatih Mosque complex, which is located on the highest hill in Istanbul. Okay and Aylin were fantastic guides. We visited the tomb of Mehmet II, known as Mehmet the Conqueror, and then walked to the local street market, which was just wonderful - not a tourist in sight! Everything was super cheap - olives, fruit and vegetables, shoes, vacuum cleaners, cheeses, butcher shops, you name it - everything! We all purchased something \u00e2\u20ac\u201c T shirts and soap for me; pine nuts, peppercorns and dried aubergines for my friend; organic strawberries at 3.5 TL/kilo for Okay etc. We then walked down a very steep hill where Okay bought simit from a wood fired bakery. Then we walked to the complex which houses the Head of the Greek Orthodox Church in the world!! And within the complex we visited the Church of St George, an ornate Greek Orthodox Church, and a seminary. And nearby is a Greek Orthodox school. Then we had apple tea and the simit at a little cafe, before catching the ferry at Fener for the ride back to Eminonu, and a walk back to the hotel. Okay passed around the kilo of strawberries on the ferry and we ate the lot! The excursion took 4.25 hours. And what did this cost? For me, 2 TL for 2 apple teas and 1.75 TL for the ferry ride!! This excursion is just another of the offerings from this amazing hotel. The night before we left, we found two gift boxes of Turkish Delight in our room. And in the morning, when we went to pay our account, and the front desk staff and owner had become aware of a less than ideal experience at another local restaurant owned by the hotel, they insisted on refunding the cost of the meal, and presented rach of us with another gift. Needless to say, we were speechless. And then I was driven to the airport in a very comfortable car, again gratis. I opened the gift on arrival at my hotel in Sydney. It was a velvet case enclosing two beautiful Gural porcelain Turkish coffee cups and saucers. What more can I say!!

The Hotel was perfectly situated for pretty much all the sightseeing in the Old town - with futher excursions made easy with the tramway stop being so close. The food was standard fare, plenty of fruit/yogurt/coffee and fresh sesame rolls. Full breakfasts catered for but with such good food being offered in the city for lunch and dinner - it wasnt needed. The concierge service was brilliant - they were eager and helpful - top marks. The little hamam was perfect to relax in at the end of a long day sightseeing - a real bonus to have, we didnt eat lunch/dinner there - but made full use of the 10% discount at their sister hotel/restaurant Pasazade - which too was very good local food and value. after dinner coffee/drinks were quick and nice to know you could have after making your way back to the hotel.

I called a few days ahead to confirm my reservation, but no one told me about the free airport transfer which they apparently offer, so I took a taxi from the airport. Unfortunately, not only had the driver never heard of the hotel (which surprised me, since it is ranked #2 for all of Istanbul on TripAdvisor), but he had to call the hotel many times -- luckily I had the phone # -- before he sort of found it. I say \"sort of\" because the entire street in front of the hotel is being dug up for some kind of renovation, so there was no car access and he could not even get close to the hotel. We had to wait 10 minutes, in the rain, for the hotel porter to come get me with all my bags, and then walk several blocks to the hotel. Now, if I had not called ahead to confirm my reservation, maybe I could have overlooked the fact that no one from the hotel had bothered to warn me about this. But since I had called, I felt they should have told me, so therefore by the time I arrived , I was quite annoyed and frustrated. The porter was as nice as can be, and and tried to make me feel better by offering me a free drink and a plate of fruit on check-in, and later he returned to tell me that he had \"scored\" me a free dinner at the hotel that evening. Again, I was not aware that this was offered to all guests, so I thought he had done something special for me, until I read the reviews more closely after my stay. After that, I almost feel like he pulled one over on me, though in his mind I suppose he was just trying to cheer me up. The decor of the hotel is beautiful, and the room was exactly as pictured on the website -- except it was too narrow, and there was literally no place to put my two suitcases. The bathroom was also very small, and I almost burned myself on the towel heater getting out of the shower. Also, you can hear the noise from the bathrooms next door (or above), as well as the construction noise from the street. I didn't understand what was so great about the location, at least in terms of the street on which the hotel is situated. There are some nice stores, but mainly auto parts, and it is not at all charming. I also found the food in the restaurant (both dinner and breakfast) to be very average, even less than average, though beautifully presented (i.e., it looked much better than it tasted). Also, the website and the staff boast 24/7 room service, but when I checked the menu, it was extremely limited, just two short pages, and there was almost nothing for vegetarians or fish lovers. That said, the staff were very pleasant, and the massage from the spa downstairs was one of the best I've ever had. I just wish they had paid more attention to guests accessing the hotel, especially when the street in front is under renovation.", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford", "Title": "\u201cTerrific hotel, excellent, friendly, service\u201d", "Author": "smithgs", "ReviewID": "UR102353416", "Content": "What a great place!

We were also told that Internet access was free in the hotel and we could use the laptops in the lobby whenever we wanted. Also, guests were given one free 3-course dinner on the night of their choice. In addition, guests could get a 10% discount at the hotel and any of the three other sister restaurants that were introduced to us. We had meals at the Sirkeci Konak and Imbat restaurants and they were all excellent. We were also told that guests could take part in a number of activities provided by the hotel free of charge. We signed up for two of them. First, the cooking course with the hotel chef where we learned how to make a Turkish appetizer and a main course. It was really fun and they served us what we had made later in the hotel restaurant. Second was a guided tour of the Fatih Marketplace. Agah, the very kind front desk attendant, took us on this tour and we were able to see a bit of the real Istanbul which many tourists might not have a chance to see. After the market, he took us to some charming old neighborhoods and showed us a beautiful old church while providing interesting info about the places we visited. I highly recommend both the cooking course & market tour to anyone visiting. The room we were given was really nice. It faced Gulhane Park and was very clean regarding sheets, towels, bathroom, etc. There were vases of fresh flowers and also a bowl of Turkish Delights for the guests to enjoy. Also, every day between 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. fresh Turkish samovar tea and sandwiches were served in the lobby free of charge. All in all, the Sirkeci Konak is a charming hotel with very friendly staff who are always willing to help you with a smile. The location was excellent (steps away from Gulhane tram station & walking distance to many major tourist sites) and the food was very good.

Everyone at the hotel knew English and were always ready to help. Our room was cozy and stylish. There was a dish of delicious Turkish Delights in our room which we enjoyed eating everyday. The view from the window was nice, too, since we faced Gulhaneh Park. The sheets, bathroom,...were very clean. No problem with the water drainage or hot water no matter how long your shower takes. Breakfast was excellent with a variety of bread, cheese, olives, yogurts, fresh fruits, .... you name it! We had our free dinner on the first night and two more meals at the hotel and they were all great. The hotel also introduces 2 other restaurants with a 10% discount. We went to one (Imbat) and again we had a delicious dinner. Everyday from 4:30 to 6:30 the hotel serves freshly made samover Turkish tea or apple tea with little sandwiches in the lobby.....and it's all free! Make sure you sign up for the tours and activities the hotel offers. They're all free & great! We did the cooking class and the Fatih Tour and had a wonderful time at both. The chef taught us to make a delicious appetizer and even more delicious food. Agah, the kind front office attendant, took us on tour to the open local market and to one of Istanbul's old neighborhoods which was very interesting. I would highly recommend both activities to anyone who is interested in cooking and/or seeing the real Istanbul. Location-wise the hotel couldn't have been in a better place. Walking distance to many major sightseeing sites and also very close to Gulhaneh Tram Station. From there you can get to other parts of the city like Tophaneh, Taksim, Civahir Shopping Mall,.....Each token for the tram or metro was 1.75 TL. I'm not sure if I can say enough about how great this hotel is. The hospitality was so amazing that we felt at home and at ease at all times. There's always a smiling face around. At the end of our stay it was one of the staff's birthday and that was something we will remember, too. What a nice surprise it was....and what a delicious cake! And it doesn't finish here!!

The front desk even has tram tokens so you don't need to hassle with getting them yourself. The wifi is free & strong (even in your room, and for all devices), the breakfast is free & lavish, and the on-site restaurant is absolutely wonderful. You also can't beat the location. Just a few tram stops to the Blue Mosque, The Sophia & The Grand Bazaar. Or a 5 minute walk to the spice market, the bridge to Euro side, or the ferry to the Asia side. The best part is it's an easy hotel to find in a city that is very foreign & easy to get turned around in.

While we are budget travelers, occasionally we treat ourselves to a night in a luxury hotel, and on this trip to Istanbul we elected to stay at the Sirkeci Konak based on the outstanding reviews. We had a five star experience with a price tag much less than the Four Seasons. Located at the edge of Gulhane Park, the Sirkeci Konak is near all the ancient sights of Sultanahmet. It is also only about one block from the tram stop, meaning much of Istanbul can be reached via public transportation with virtually no walking. We really enjoyed walking around in the Sirkeci neighborhood, which is evolving into a charming place. We found the shops less expensive than Sultanahmet and the salesmen far less aggressive. The many restaurants and the pedestrian street with sidewalk cafes are very welcoming. The hotel itself is designed in understated elegance. Rooms are tastefully appointed. With luxurious linen, quality furniture and a choice of four types of pillows. It would be difficult to imagine anything other than a perfect night's sleep. The bathroom was beautiful and there was an abundance of hot water and huge luscious towels. Rooms are appointed with a flat screen TV and a good selection of English TV channels. The free Wi-Fi we enjoyed was among the most reliable we experienced in Turkey. Little touches like a filled candy dish and fresh flowers added to the harmony of the guest room. Two elevators eliminate the need to climb stairs. The Sirkeci Konak, however, is much more than a hotel. It is an entire experience. After registration one is ushered into the seating area of the lobby and the guest manager or day manager asks about plans and provides specific directions to reach each location. They offer maps and literature about the city. If you are a first-time visitor with a few jitters, this little get-acquainted meeting leaves you ready and anxious to tour the city. Tea is served every afternoon in the tasteful lobby. Over glasses of tea and little sandwiches guests share daily experiences. Often the owner of the hotel joins the guests at this afternoon reception. As one would certainly know from the quality of the hotel, he is charming, but unpretentious and is sincerely interested in each of his guests. We enjoyed the cooking class. We had great fun preparing our evening meal. The chef was delightful, and meeting other participants was enriching. Everyone wore a chef hat and coat and we all took lots of photos. After the meal had been prepared we went to the dining room where we ate the dinner we had made. It was a lovely experience. Other cultural offerings at the hotel include backgammon lessons, a trip to the weekly market in Fatih and wine and cheese tastings. The Sirekci Konak not only provides luxurious lodgings, but they also introduce guests to many unique offerings in Istanbul. The hotel offers two excellent restaurants and the complimentary breakfast is superior with many choices including standard Turkish fare of vegetables, olives, yogurt and bread as well as fresh fruit, freshly squeezed orange juice, several other juice selections, tea, filtered coffee and several choices of meats. The breakfast server is personable and charming. The hotel also offers a nice indoor swimming pool along with a complete spa facility where one can enjoy a Turkish bath experience. A rooftop terrace is available during appropriate seasons, where one can enjoy a beverage and view of the city. I lack the words to describe the hotel staff. From the manager to the maid each person is completely charming. We were greeted with smiles and as much conversation as we wished to experience. Clearly the staff is well-educated, and carefully trained, but each person also displays delightful and hospitable personality. We truly felt valued and pampered by every employee. We only had one problem with this hotel. The room was so lovely and the staff so charming and the on-site restaurants so good and the cultural experiences so rich that we did not want to leave the hotel. We left late and returned early and really had to force ourselves to go out and explore the city. I often write that one does not go to Istanbul to sit in a hotel room, but the Sirekci Konak is an exception to that statement.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201chiddentreasure\u201d", "Author": "Chris00001", "ReviewID": "UR93135943", "Content": "Fantastic hotel very helpful and friendly staff.

This country is unique because of the exceptional hospitality. Turkish people are mainly men and women of their word and are characterized by their heart sharing culture and their real hospitality. You can go to Turkey with complete confidence : please, don't mix up Turkey with arabic countries. We already staid in SIRKECI KONAK hotel in Istanbul more than 12 times. It's probably the best hotel we know in comparison with all other hotels in Turkey. Well located closed to historical area SULTANAHMET : 5 minutes walking from museums and mosques, 200 meters from the tram and thanks to it less than half an hour from the modern area TAKSIM in which you could find so many restaurants and shops. All in SIRKECI KONAK hotel is perfect : cleanliness, well decorated and such comfortable rooms (some of them are a little small but who spend his whole time in the room ?), wonderful breakfast, 2 lovely restaurants (one anatolian cook and one fish restaurant), a very warm lobby, not expensive drinks prices (one beer around 2.40 euros) and above all a unique welcome from any people especially frontdesk Mr. AGAH ALKAN, relationship manager Ms. EZGI and Ms. DILHAN. They are ever looking to help you. If you have the chance to meet the owner Mr. Faruk BOYACI, you'll be surprised by his unpretentiousness and his warm welcome.

In summer, you could have your dinner on the terrace. From Sirkeci Konak, 500 meters away, you could have a drink in Red River Pub which is one of the Sirkeci Group. Endly, if you are looking for any information for instance restaurant, they will recommand you such famous turkish not far from SIRKECI KONAK.

We normally stay in cheaper hotels but my partner was treating me for my 40th birthday and it was definitely money well spent.

On our last day the staff very kindly gave me beautiful birthday presents and gathered round to wish me happy birthday which was a lovely touch. I would go back in a heartbeat.

My first visit was alone and this trip i was accompanied by a friend. Located just outside the walls of the Topkapi Palace, the neighborhood is pedestrian friendly and exceptionally well located for sightseeing of the many attractions of istanbul-the Cisterns, Grand Bazzar, Hagia Sophia, etc.When you enter the front door of this hotel, you immediately know this will be a unique experience. Instead of a big reception desk with a counter separating you from the hotel employees, you first pass through a small parlor setting and continue to the desk where you are graciously offered a chair and a cup of tea. Signing in or registering is a delight and sets the tone for your entire experience. Passing the restaurant, home to the best breakfast buffet I have ever had at a hotel, you can take one of the easy chairs or sit at a banquette which seems more like a large family living room than a hotel. There are computers and printers for the guests to use and a great selection of Istanbul guidebooks. This is a wonderful location for lounging or meeting friends. Complementary tea and snacks are offered every afternoon. The rooms are very nicely arranged and absolutely clean and well maintained. In addition to the excellence of the food and surroundings of the hotel, the warm and friendly staff are unsurpassed. I think I was personally greeted by each and everyone of the maids, waiters, bellmen, as well as the concierge and even the corporate CEO who frequently joined the guests in the living room/parlor to take tea and chat while offering any assistance with bookings needed. It is the fine quality of the hotel furnishings and service, but what really sets the Sirkeci Konak apart from run of the mill hotels is the personal touch...each guest is treated like a valued friend or family member visiting. I spend about 1/3 of the nights of the year in hotels all over the world and I have never experienced the personal connection and friendliness of the staff of this property who all are eager to provide outstanding levels of service as well as convey a real sense of care for the wellbeing of all of their guests.

From the housekeeper right through to the concierge they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do enough for us. Never once did we receive a negative response and were always greeted with smiles. At one point the front office attendant offered to go out and buy tram tokens for us while apologising that they had none left at reception! We were in Istanbul to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and having been let down by Interflora I sent a last-minute email to Dilhan in Customer Relations to help me and of course she had flowers ready for me to present to my wife at the appropriate time. Need I have worried? \u00e2\u20ac\u201c never! Queries about directions, tours, shopping advice etc. were met with enthusiasm - maps and brochures were produced instantly and were marked and written on to make sure we understood. The advice was excellent. Along with their normal room presentation of Turkish delight and tea/coffee facilities we also had a display of fresh fruit and bottle of wine to help us celebrate. Secretly, we think they upgraded our room because of our anniversary. When we were leaving we were given a present which turned out to be Turkish Delight! On our arrival at the Hotel we were offered a welcome drink in the lounge while we checked-in. It was so relaxing after coming through Attaturk Airport which was packed with returning holidaymakers and their expectant families. Our room was excellent and laid out to give a great sense of space. The comfortable bed had a pillow menu and the en-suite bathroom had a Jacuzzi bath with shower. The adjoining balcony has views over Gulhane Park and the Bosphorus is partly visible to the left. The room was quiet and restful and at night there was no street noise while the 4am call to prayer was never heard. Breakfast consisted of an extensive hot & cold buffet and every table had a daily pamphlet (The Sirkeci Daily Express) with interesting facts on Istanbul and most important, the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weather forecast. Serving lasts from 7am to 11am \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no worry about missing breakfast after a late night out! In the afternoon tea and salad bagels are served, free-of-charge in the lounge, most welcome if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re returning from sightseeing or shopping trips. There is free wi-fi throughout the hotel and other free facilities include the swimming pool, sauna, turkish bath (hammam) and gym. While the food in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two restaurants is lovely and well presented, we took a liking to the Imbat restaurant in the Sirkeci Konak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sister hotel the Orient Express, which is around the corner, about one hundred and fifty metres away. There we were met by head-waiter Cemal who looked after us superbly with excellent food and lovely wine. On our final night in Istanbul he produced a tasting menu of 3 main courses and invited us to give our opinion as they were about to make changes to their existing menu. All three were absolutely brilliant, one better than the other. When we were leaving he presented us with a bottle of wine and refused to charge us for our meals!! How do you respond to that? The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location is very good. If the street may not be the most salubrious in Istanbul, the proximity to the tram (2 minutes) and all the major sites is terrific, while at night all is very quiet. With Gulhane Park just across the road, the entrance is just 5 minute away and the Topkapi Palace a further 5 minutes walk inside, passing by the Archaeological Museum on the way. The Haghia Sophia is only 10 mins. from the hotel while the Blue Mosque is a further 5 mins. Walking to the Grand Bazaar takes around 20 mins. and the Spice Market would take about half-an-hour. With a trip on the tram - just up from the hotel, followed by a short run on the funicular underground railway, access to Taksim Square and the main pedestrianised shopping area is very easy. We found the people of Istanbul very friendly everywhere we went and the city bustling and full of atmosphere. As a pair of 60-somethings we walked all over the place and arrived at some of our destinations more by accident than design. At no time did we ever feel threatened or afraid and were totally comfortable everywhere we went. We would highly recommend Istanbul as a place to visit and most definitely the Sirkeci Konak Hotel where we always felt so welcome and at home.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cFirst trip to Istanbul, and the welcome and service that we received at the Hotel was second to none I've experienced.\u201d", "Author": "Bobby_Duncan", "ReviewID": "UR88501351", "Content": "Definitely stay at this hotel again if / when we return to Istanbul.

Our room was small but beautifully decorated with a little balcony wwhich boasted glimpses of the Bosphorous and the Blue Mosque. Also in the room on arrival was a complimentary bottle of wine and turkish delight. We ate that night in one of the two hotel restaurants and enjoyed fabulous authentic Turkish cuisine. All the staff could not have been more helpful and on the following night, which was my husband's birthday, the waiters came out carrying a cake and singing happy birthday. They even gave him a present of two china cups and saucers. Although the hotel is small it manages to squeeze in an indoor pool and large turkish bath and one of our favourite touches was complimentary apple tea and sandwiches between 4.30 and 6pm. When it was time to go the staff all came to bid us farewell and gave us a present which turned out to be a box of turkish delight. Quite honestly I have never come across such service in a hotel before and the staff made every effort to make our stay memorable. I could not recommend this hotel highly enough. Shame British Airways could not in any way match Sirkeci Konak for customer service as they let us wait seven hours in the airport on the way home before cancelling the flight and subjecting us to a night in an aiport hotel before rather unwillingly re-booking us onto a flight the next morning.

We booked to stay there because of the rave reviews on Trip Advisor. Those reviews were spot on. All of the other guests also had nothing but praise for all aspects of the hotel. The difficult thing is to decide which is better, the location, the meals, the free afternoon tea or the wonderful hospitality. Firstly, its location is within 20 minutes walk of all the major attractions - including the Grand Bazaar, The Spice Market, The Blue Mosque and the hotel overlooks the gardens adjacent to the Topkapi Palace. The meals in both restauarants, the ground floor seafood or rooftop garden, are excellent as is the service. Their sister hotel - The Orient Express - 5 minute walk around the corner, also has a good rooftop restaurant. When you you arrive do not be \"put off\" by what appears to be a dingy lane - some shops open during the day and at least it is quiet at night and no trams to disturb you. Speaking of this laneway, we had 3 large Turkish plates shipped home to Australia from one of these shops called \"Ceres Gifts\", the proprietor is Ali, and all arrived perfectly in tact - boxed within foam. The most outsanding feature of the Sirkeci Konak is its hospitality by all of their staff. The reviews on Trip Advisor bear this out. They speak good English and are always eager to help and offer any assistance. The wonderful Ezgi and the staff make you feel welcome and treat you as a special guest rather than simply another tourist passing through Istanbul. We accidentaly left a small back pack in the front lobby - during the free afternoon tea. They sent it back to us in Australia - at no charge. We have stayed in many hotels over the years but not one hotel can match their wonderful hospitality. Well done Sirkeci Konak - you deserve your number 1 rating on Trip Advisor.

With only a few days to see Istanbul, we wanted to be close to all of the major historic sites and this hotel is across the street from the Topkapi Palace walls, how much closer can one get? While more upscale and chic hotels exist in other parts of Istanbul, traffic is abysmal and it can take hours to go a short distance by cab. We simply walked out the door and went on foot or by tram to most of the highlights. Sirkeci Konak also offers great value with the breakfast included, afternoon tea, free wifi plus computers in the lobby, and free airport pick-up and complimentary dinner in the hotel restaurant to guests who stay three nights or more. My only downgrade to this hotel was the actual comfort of our room. The lighting is poor and not conducive to reading.

The location of the hotel, is only 50 yards or so from one of the main streets, but it's just far enough away to be perfectly quiet.

The hotel was full for that night, but they offered to move us in the morning. This was all done without any fuss at all, and they were happy to accomodate the request.

Other good points - breakfast has a vast array of choices, the meals in the hotel restraunts are excellent, afternoon tea is lovely, the drinks in the lobby are the same price as the bars in town, room service menu is well priced (didn't try it though), the daily supply of turkish delight in the rooms is a great touch, and the whole hotel is perfectly positioned for the major sights and a tram stop is only 50 yards away. On leaving the hotel and waiting for the car to take us to the airport we were given presents to take away (a presentation box of turkish coffee cups and saucers, and a box of turkish delight!), which put the seal on a memorable stay in a first rate hotel.

There is a tram right outside. I have no idea if this is noisy or not because I was in room 1109 which is on the first floor and faces the park. My room was very quiet and I got a good night's sleep. When we arrived we were offered apple or Turkish tea which was very welcome after the 45 minute drive from Ataturk airport. I also saw on another day, some people arriving really early during breakfast time and the Customer Service Rep offered the newly arrived guests to help themselves to the buffet breakfast which is very generous. The service is really good and the staff are super-friendly. They have a library full of Lonely Planet and other brands of guide books if you forget yours as I did. They have a complimentary small pool downstairs, small hamam and steam room and gym in the basement. The complimentary afternoon tea from 4.30-630pm consists of apple or Turkish tea (both lovely!) and sandwiches (not great). It's the same thing everyday but it's nice that they offer it. The rooms have duvets and I felt comfortable sleeping at night as the room was spotless. The room is a bit dark (as are 98% of hotel rooms I go to) but there is a small flat screen TV which is sufficient for the small amount of time one spends in the room. There is a kettle and some tea / coffee. They also give you some Turkish delight in the room which is nice and a free box on check-out. I am allergic to cow's milk and requested soya and they were very helpful and provided it for me at breakfast no problems. Dilhan is very friendly and took us to our cooking class (you have to book ahead and it's 5pm for 50 minutes), It's not a very serious cooking class but it's fun nonetheless. You chop up some spring onions and tomatoes and beef and make two courses (starter of cos cos and tomato paste and cumin etc) and a stir-fry beef dish. The chef is very friendly and it's good to see the kitchen as it is very clean. Class size is limited to about 8 people. The class is free and held on Mondays and Fridays. The service really stood out for me. The staff are just so friendly. I would return. Oh also there is free wifi and breakfast is included in the room rate.

The service couldn't be better and we were asked at the end of our stay whether there was anything upon which they could improve....and they meant it. whne we said there wasn't anything, we were pressed ......'anything, however small???' The rooms are not enormous but more than adequate. We took over two rooms ( two doubles) and althigh a late booking, they managed to put us next door to each pther and we seemed to have a corridor to ourselves which was great as it seemed to be almost ensuite and private even though we left the doors to the rooms open to each other. We may have been lucky in that regard. The air conditioning was good and although it was busy outside, it wasn't noisy. The bathroom was nice - very clean which is my 'thing'. We We just had a shower, the other room had a bath and shower. If that bothers you, its worth asking. Dressing gowns and slippers are provided. Perhaps the only irritant is that the wardrobe area was short so didn't allow me to hang my dresses properly.....but if that's all I can complain about.....!!!!!!!!! The pool is a splash pool but very few hotels seem to have a pool anyway so it was a 'plus'. Nobody seemed to be using it apart form us. Again towels and service were good. I didn't use the fitness room but my son (who was training for something or other, so taking it seriously) said it was 'fine'. That's quite high praise. One of the really nice touches was the free afternoon tea at 4.30 (I'm not sure if this was just for the sumer season or not). They provided tea or juice and small cheese and tomato rolls. I don't know quite what they did with such simple ingredients but they were delicious. We quickly developed a routine of up and out quite early in the morning for hard sightseeing, back for afternoon tea, quick sleep and recharge batteries and then out for dinner. Bliss. The hotel had somone available at all times to help with tourist info eg what's open (not easy as things shut on random days), nearest bank, how you get there etc... Very helpful and always right. They own a number of restaurants including one on the roof of the hotel. We only tried that one. It wasn't the best meal we had in Istanbul but equally, there were no complaints and it was more than good enough.

We were not disappointed. The staff are genuinely friendly. We didnt have interconnecting rooms (teher are none), and the rooms (we had two triple rooms) were not large. However, the service more than makes up for it. 1. location- central and walking distance to the historic sites-dont catch a cab! the grand bazaar is a bit further, but is walkable. 2. food-all more expensive than I remember it from 10 years ago. the hotel has two restaurants-both excellent, for a family of 6- we paid TL140. It all adds up! You could just get street food- kebabs, but choose a busy place (TL 5 or less). The kids ate at Mcdonalds once- the lack of english from the staff caused confusion with the order however. The Mcdonalds is a short walk-going towards the Bosphorous. The Faros restaurant- 1 minute from the hotel does pizza and pasta (once your love of kebabs is satisified). There is a great baklava and tea shop on the corner of the main square towards the Bosphorous downhill from the hotel. Open seating upstairs to look out across the water. 3. Travel- we walked. A Cab gets you to the business area-near Taxim Square, and you find the equivalent of Oxford Street- and just as busy! We didnt try the trams. 4. Price- we paid in cash- they discount the price for this. Also, check the sterling price and euro price with them before you change currency in the UK. We found that their rate was better than we could get in the UK, so we fixed a price and paid in sterling. They also do transfers to and from the airport, thus making it easy with the family. Ask how much they will include and see what they say. You dont ask, you dont get. 5. sites-Most entries are 10-20TL. Kids under 12 are free- but at the topkapi palace they asked for ID to confirm. The rest were more sensible, and just looked at the Kids! 6. A Must- the hotel does a cooking session- Kids>12 can do it, but they allowed by 10 year old to do it. It is at 5pm twice a week- well worth it, and you get to eat the food after-so have an early lunch on that day! Do ask for the 4th or 5th floor if you want to see the park from your window.

We are veterans travelers with many European trips under our belt. The staff was helpful, warm, friendly, and genuine.Ezgi, the customer relations host, was incredible. She looked after our every need. She found out it was our anniversary and we were showered with gifts. I felt like I was staying with a loving family. She made a point of inviting us to a wonderful play, Troia, our second night in our stay. I asked her how much and she waived away any suggestion of money. We were treated to a night of world class dance and theater. She found out that we were headed to Izmir and that I had rented a car. She took it upon herself to call and check on my reservation to make sure everything was in order. In addition she took the initiative in reserving us a GPS unit. When I asked her how she knew that I would need it she replied, \"Just in case. They only had one left. I could always call back and cancel it if you did not want it.\" It turned out to be a brilliant and ever so thoughtful move on her part. We also were treated to mezes and a wine tasting, sampling the best wines of Turkey that was complimentary. Ezgi arranged that also and made sure we attended. Upon leaving she gave us her cell phone and conveyed to us that in traveling throughout Turkey if we needed any assistance to please call. The most amazing thing about Ezgi and the entire staff at the hotel was I never felt they were obsequious. I was struck and touched by how genuine they all were. The more we talked with them it was clear how they regard their work and the hotel guest. My wife and I were sad to leave this hotel. They set a high standard for the rest of our trip. The location of the hotel is perfect. It's an easy walk to all the major sites. There is a beautiful park next door to walk, run, or simply to hang out in. The tram stop is a 100 meters away. The hotel is on a side street so it feels private and away from the bustle of the city. The restaurants at the hotel are excellent. I'll save that for my review under the restaurant section. The room was spotless, quiet, and had a nice view. Breakfast: We could not believe our eyes the first morning we went down for breakfast. We got up late and I thought we had stumbled into lunch or a special event. The spread was out of this world. There were cereals, fresh fruit, eggs, a variety of meats, yogurt, veggies, breads, croissants and the list goes on. The staff were super attentive. My coffee cup never reached empty. In summary, I highly recommend this hotel. This was our first trip to Turkey and we were a bit nervous. Staying at a hotel of this caliber quickly relaxed us and gave us a wonderful taste of Turkish hospitality. I think many people from the U.S. have a negative preconception of Turkey that despite the guide books is tough to get past until they actually visit. Having a warm, welcoming hotel that picks you up at the airport upon arrival quickly put us at ease as I am sure it would do for others. We look forward to returning to Istanbul and we would not even consider staying anywhere else. In closing, I have to say I would have enjoyed meeting the owner. It's clear to have a staff this brilliant, competent, and caring he must be a very special person. I know that leadership sets the tone for this kind of exemplarily service.

Although the hotel is situated on a side street, its location is ideal as it is within walking distance to all the major sites. We decided to walk instead of taking the tram and we ended up walking everywhere, even to Ishtikal Street in the Taksim area (we were on a cruise prior to this and wanted to walk off the pounds we gained). We had a deluxe room on the top floor and would definitely recommend this. The room was spotless and tastefully decorated with a balcony overlooking the Gulhane park. You can see people strolling in the park as well as birds nesting in trees while sitting out on the balcony. We were happy to find the room spacious and the bathroom had a fully enclosed shower on one side (not one of those half covered shower where water gets splattered all over the floor) and a bathtub on the other. Shower water pressure was great and temperature control in the room worked fine as we like to keep the room at a cool 21 celsius. Breakfasts (included) came with a wide variety of choice and included a spread of home made breads, fruit, meats, eggs, cheeses and cereals besides some local items. Since we stayed 3 nights, we had a free dinner at their restaurant as well and it was good. Although it was available every afternoon, we never made it back to the hotel in time to enjoy their free afternoon tea and simit sandwiches. We had dinner one night at Imbat, located on the rooftop of one of their sister hotels, and it had a gorgeous view of the city and the Bosphorous. Food was quite good as well and came with a 10% discount as the hotel was part of the Sirkeci group. Dinner on the third night was at Sofali G in the Taksim area. That area is just hopping and we had a fun time people watching. The best part of Sirkeci Konak is the staff. Ezgi, the guest relations member, is an absolute sweetheart. She is warm, friendly and very helpful. When we first arrived, she sat us down and provided us with refreshments and all the information we needed on the major sites to visit including a tourist map and tram line guide card. She made dinner reservations for us, arranged for a taxi to take us to the airport and made a point of chatting with us whenever we run into her.

After my card was blocked so it could not be used, the hotel staff offered complimentary refreshments and I eventually felt composed enough to continue sightseeing. You do not receive this kind of personal attention in many hotels. I was very grateful to the reception staff. Theft happens anywhere and everywhere and I still think Turkish people are extremely good. The rest of our stay was wonderful. The position of the hotel in a quiet street was perfect. We were given a tourist map on arrival and realised all the major sites could be reached on foot and the tram stop was about 4 minutes walk from the hotel. With helpful advice from Guest Relations we were able to see all the other places we wished to visit. Breakfast offered a wide variety of choice and I sampled and enjoyed some different tastes. Late afternoon after a day of sightseeing we would enjoy a relaxing drink on the roof top terrace overlooking the park. We ate in a number of local restaurants but by far our favourite meal was in the Neyzade Restaurant in the hotel where once again the service was excellent without being obtrusive. I read other Istanbul hotel reviews but definitely made the right choice with the Sirkeci Konak.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monza, Italy", "Title": "\u201cWelcome & Kindness\u201d", "Author": "LadyMT", "ReviewID": "UR66332832", "Content": "I stayed 4 night between the end of May and the beginning of June.

From the very first minute we stepped into the hotel my husband and I felt we were greeted as members of the Sirkeci family and not as any kind of tourists. The hotel is very professionally run with the Front Office Attendant, Okay, and Guest Relations Team (a special mention to an adorable young lady called Ezgi) always at hand smiling and warm while not obtrusive at all: unlike other hotels they never try to sell you expensive trips, or send you to their friends\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shops; instead they organize free activities in and out of the hotel: they took us to the less well-known Fatih market and had us tour the Greek High School (not open to the public), all the while discussing Turkey with us and answering all our questions in the most clever way. We had a cooking lesson in the cook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immaculate kitchen one night and a wine- and cheese-tasting session on another night, all thiat free of charge. The location is absolutely perfect in a small non touristy quiet street, within walking distance of the big Istanbul sights of Haghia Sofia, the Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace and the Grand Bazaar, and close to a tram line that can take you anywhere in town across the Bosphorus. The hotel sorted out taxis and airport shuttle for us (the driver will be holding your name as you walk out - the airport shuttle and the first three-course dinner in their restaurant were free of charge: the latter idea is excellent when you get there at night after a long trip). They booked all the restaurants we asked them, found out the location of the medical lab we needed during our stay, printed all the necessary maps for the taxi drivers to take us there, always explained them how to reach their destinations. The spotless, well-decorated room with the balcony overlooking Gulhane park will long be remembered as well-as the rooftop terrace with its elegant resin deckchairs. The breakfast buffet was excellent and plentiful. We had free tea & snack in the afternoon. We had dinner several times at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fish restaurant and enjoyed delicious grilled sea-bass (the fish restaurant is very well rated in town). What is more, the free wireless Internet connection allowed me to continue working mornings and nights and never lose touch with my kids back home. Both my husband and I enjoyed the Sultan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s massage in the hammam of the hotel and my only suggestion would be to have a hairdresser at hand in the hotel or - why not - encourage the installation of a hairdresser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close by. Because the volcano ash had prevented us to go for a week over Easter the first time we were supposed to only spend 3 nights at the Sirkeci Konak and then relocate to a lesser quality hotel close-by: Okay, the Front Office attendant went out of his way to accommodate us a fourth night. When we did leave for the hotel next door and found out breakfasts (there and the rest) were terrible they allowed us to breakfast for free and use all the amenities of the hotel, including the extensive rooftop terrace overlooking Gulhane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Park (the park around Topkapi), as if we had still been staying there.

I spent weeks on tripadvisor and hotels.com reading almost every review on about half a dozen well ranked hotels in Sultanahmet. I chose Sirkeci Konak and got in touch with them. They were overall prompt in getting back via email, and answered my questions in detail. I was EXTREMELY happy with our choice. I will lay out the details here: 1) Located in a very nice, quiet location so we got excellent sleep 2) Very close to all major sites: 10 min walk to Topkapi, Blue Mosque, Haghia Sophia, Grand Bazaar; less than 10 min walk to Galata Bridge, boat tours; walkable to just about anywhere....and we did! With a baby stroller nonetheless. 3) Tram is right around the corner. Although we walked just about everywhere from our hotel, this is a great choice if you don't have a baby stroller with you (it's very crowed inside tram) 4) Breakfast is to die for! Wonderful spread, and a hot breaktfast. Many hotels do not offer hot breakfast in the area. You don't need to eat anything until lunchtime if you do breakfast right. 5) Free 3 course dinner upon arrival 6) Free transport from airport (driver will be holding your name as you walk out) with a min 3 nite stay 7) Free cooking class with chef (a lot of fun) 8) 2 restaurants in hotel: both very tasty; highly recommended. 9) Staff is AMAZING. very, very warm and sweet and sincere. no fakeness. we were so happy with everything that we left a $100 tip for the staff at the end of our stay. from the guest relations team, Agah, Ezgi, Dilhan, as well as Biral and Sukru were wonderful and very helpful. food services staff and management consisted of Mohammed,Engin,Rukiye, Hakan, Zehra, as well as more individuals whose names I sadly forget. everyone always made time to talk and smile and even play with our son. we actually do miss them; they are good people with warm hearts. When needed, they would bring warm milk out for our son at night. our cleaning maid, Edibe, was very good...esp since we had toddler who would create mess in room; his cot sheets were changed just like ours. 10) I asked for discount b/c of our long stay: they gave 11% discount when we paid in cash, one night free, upgraded our room from standard to deluxe standard for free. This was very helpful if you have children and need a cot, and have a lot of luggage. make sure you know the size dimensions of your room; it is very helpful esp if you have much luggage or children. Some of the negative reviews posted on the website consist of saying that hotel is located near car auto parts. Not once did we hear any loud noises coming from that area. our room faced Gulhane Park. Helpful hint: when leaving hotel's main door, make a right turn and then you will get to busy foot traffic and tram, etc. If you make a left turn, then you will have to pass the auto shops, etc. you can easily walk around that by going right out of the hotel. it is NOT a major issue at all.

Expect better and more personal service than what is offerred on the Club Floors of your 5 star hotels. The hotel organised airport transfers which were excellent. Our driver greeted the 3 of us at the arrivals hall and we were promptly transferred to a large modern van (which would comfortably seat 8 to 9 people) and taken direct to the hotel (approx 40 mins). Our return transfer to the airport was a similar experience. On arrival at the Sirkeci we felt we were greeted by a welcoming committee. Luggage was quickly handled by others as we were ushered to a seat at the check-in desk and offerred refreshments and keys. We were then whisked away to the lounge by the wonderful Ezgi at Guest Relations who gave us a quick brief on the hotel and supplied us with maps, tram routes and information on Istanbul. Afternoon tea was then offerred, which was another complimentary service of the hotel. We were then ushered to our triple room which was beautifully fitted out and included wall mounted plasma and a bowl of turkish delight on the bedside table. The verandah off the room gave us a lovely outlook onto the street and the beautiful flowering trees in the Park behind. We could also glimpse the Bosphorous if we looked down the street. The bathroom included bath, shower and toilet and was of a good size for European Hotels. It was not of the marble and granite variety, but completely acceptable and spotlessly clean. The room was very comfortable, compared to what is considered 5 star in European hotels. With the location, being off the main thoroughfare there is no noise to contend with at night. A pillow menu is offerred, and the beds were the best of 5 weeks of travel, better than the Atlantis in Dubai. Location was sensational. It was less than 20 metres walk to the street junction which appears to be the main thoroughfare for the tram routes, restaurants, shops etc. A further 5 minute walk to the Palace, Aya Sofia, Cistern, Blue Mosque etc. In the other direction were more shops, ATM's, restaurants etc. I was travelling with my two daughters aged 15 and 11 and the hotel location, surrounding streets etc. were perfectly safe to wander at anytime of the day or night. We never felt threatened and the kids would even wonder across the street to purchase snacks. During our first stay at the Sirkeci my youngest daughter was ill and the care and assistance we were given by the hotel was unbelievable. Luckily we were able to extend our stay and returned to the hotel after our tour, for another two nights. The staff were all equally wonderful. We never experienced Turkish hospitality on this scale anywhere else during our 16 days in Turkey, and the Conrad's and Hilton's failed miserably in comparison. On return to the Sirkeci, we partook in the Turkish Cooking class, complimentary for hotel guests. This was a real treat, and the bonus was you got to dine on what you cooked in the hotel restaurant. Breakfast was situated in the restaurant at street level and was excellent. We also ate from the bar menu, the seafood and lobby restaurants and all meals were excellent. Free Internet was also available to guests. The guest relations staff were wonderful with confirming flights and assisting stranded guests due to cancelled flights from the Icelandic volcano or the strikes in Greece. I have never stayed anywhere where I have been so impressed with the total team effort of staff.

Lasting impression: warm welcome, ever helpful staff. Location: I had no problem with the location of this hotel. Yes, it is situated on what could be described as Auto Alley (there were spare parts shops nearby) but this was a quiet street. The only noises came from the maintenance work being done on the wall around the Topkapi Park across the street. Views depended on which side of the hotel you were on. My room was bright and faced the park, nice views. Rooms on the other side maybe not so good and the importance of that depends on how long you want to spend in your room. Remember that if you feel a bit confined by your room size there are other escapes. The roof top terrace -a word of caution here \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe elevator doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go all the way to the top\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is true in the literal sense as a flight of stairs stands between you and the great outdoors. For my last morning at the hotel- when I had it all to myself on a gloriously sunny day, there couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been a more delightful place in the whole city. In the afternoon when you are tired from a day of sight-seeing, retreat to a very pleasant reception room in which apple tea and sandwiches are served. By evening you will want to try out the relaxing Hamam downstairs. Sitting in a nice warm room, whether or not you opt for a massage or scrub is always soothing. Sauna also available, and if you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walked off all that naughty Turkish delight provided in your room, a well equipped gym for you to use. There is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcswimming pool\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but that is more of a plunge pool to cool off in after your sauna. Sirkeci Konak is very close to many of the cultural attractions that you will want to see, my elderly mother and I walked to all of them. The terrain is not flat and cobbles are hard on the feet, so sensible shoes are a must. Transport: The tram is very quick walk away. The system is easy to work out, and the helpful hotel staff will explain all about this on your arrival. Size of room: This may be of concern depending on how much luggage you are travelling with. I am sure there are hotels will more spacious rooms in Istanbul, so if space concerns you, get an estimate of room size first. I have to agree with a previous posting that the room may be small, but in days gone by I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in very expensive hotels in London that are even more cramped. Special touches: Look for a copy of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSirkeci Daily Express\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on your breakfast table to let you know about happenings in the arts, nightlife, ideas for a day out, a couple of Turkish phrases or words, weather and also to check on which museums are closed that day. Great innovations: In your room-key folder you find a small piece of paper with Turkish Cultural Activities run by the hotel, usually at 5.30pm. I highly recommend the trip to the Wednesday 10.30am traditional market tour: this is where the locals shop for their necessities, not for souvenirs. And do learn how to play backgammon- its fun! Free wireless internet: in my room I was always connected to the web. Breakfast: traditional Turkish breakfast plus a host of cereals, bread, jams, fruit and juices. Cheese and sliced meats provide plenty of energy for the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activities ahead. The staff at Hotel Sirkeci Konak are extremely welcoming and helpful but also very professional.

Wonderful buffet breakfast and the complimentary afternoon tea in the lounge became a ritual chatting with Faruk and his staff about our day and their recommendations for the next day. Meals in the restaurant were excellent and relaxed, we also ate at one of the hotels other restaurants, Pasazade and found the food and welcome just as good.

Tea became a no-miss scene with my group- the perfect time to plan the next day as well as try to figure out where to eat.

They gave us good recommendations for food and shopping, as well as seeming to be quite pleased when we enjoyed something. All the staff had great pride in their city, and their country, and this was evident throughout our stay. It is true, these are not huge rooms.

And we decided to travel to Istanbul for 4 days, along with 2 dauthers (21 & 11). We were searching many hours, reading lots of the Tripadvisor reviews. And wondering very high rating of the Sirkeci Konak hotel. Is it really true what people writing about this hotel? Anyway, they contacted very fast and confirmed the reservation by E-mail, we ordered then car to deliver us from airport to hotel. Our flight was late for one hour, but then everything went smoothly. Driver was waiting us with a sign and after 25 minutes we were in the hotel. Hotel staff was very cool, not as usually fake happiness faces. We had connected rooms with kids and very nice rooms, perfectly renovated, every millimeter was made with love and high skills, clean, fresh flowers in the both sides of the bed. Welcome note from the hotel owner with the direct phone number to his cellphone. Turkish sweets on the table...etc. So our stay in Istanbul started with pleasant stay in the hotel. Location is perfect, all the sights are on the walking distance away. We only used taxi once for driving to Taksim square and later back to hotel (10 euros one way). We used twice a hotel pool and sauna. There was also hammam - a turkish sauna. On the birthday evening we asked staff for some restorant with view to the city and sea, and they suggested for us nearby Sirkeci Group Hotel called Orient Express, and boy, it was really dining pleasure on the rooftop with the panoramic view of Istanbul, Bosphorus, Topkapi Palace and St. Sophia. Food was excellent and service superb. Such a good service is hard to find in the Europe and we have lot to learn from turkish hospitality. The best part was after dinner, when they suddenly turned off lights, and came to us singing \"Happy birthday\", with a cake and candles. We were very happy, everybody sang along and applaused. My husband was really surpirised and so was I, because I didn't wait that they'll come to the other restaurant to congradulate him. We were all very grateful for this kind of kindness. And when we went back to our hotel, a surprise was waiting in our room, more presents! We got turkish coffe-cups for 6 persons, and besides of that we felt that we are very appreciated and loved. Next morning, when the car brought us to the airport, there were three men from hotel personnel, waving us good-bye. :) That made us feel that we really want to go back. Amazing sincere friendlyness.

When we returned to the airport for our journey home we took the tram at a cost of 6 turk lira for the two of us. The tram stop is 50 metres from the hotel. It was very simple and i can give directions if you care to email me. I was rather apprehensive when the driver seemed to be going down some seedy backstreets and i wondered what kind of choice i had made but all worries evaporated when we arrived at the hotel, the pictures of which are so adequatley shown on this site. The welcome was warm and friendly and so very informative. There was a customer relations hostess on hand to help us with vital tourist info and she and her colleague were invaluable to us during our stay. They were around all day and would help with any query we may have had. They booked restaurants for us, booked shows etc. Our room was roomy and very comfy. We were greeted with a bowl of fresh Turkish delight and a note from our chamber maid to the effect that we can choose different pillows if we weren't satisfied. The room had:- tea/coffeee making facilities flat screen tv, free wifi (this was superb) mini bar that didn't charge everytime you opened the fridge unlike some 4/5 star hotels. (We like to keep our chocolate, fruit etc in fridge). free bottled water, safe, sewing kits, shoe polish, shower cap etc etc . There was aircon but we didn't need it. The room we had had a little mini balcony which when we opened the double doors gave the room plenty of air and light. These windows are double glazed which is good as not all need the 5am call to prayer and this is well muted. The hotel breakfast was just the ticket (incl in price). Fruit, cheeses, yoghurts, breads, croissants cakes, cereals, hot food, eggs, jams etc etc. We ate in the restaurant at night and highly recommend it. I used the Turkish bath and Sauna downstairs which was great. There was a tiny swimming pool and fitness area which we didn't use. There was also a rooftop area which we didn't use. A nice touch was the free late afternoon reception the hotel laid on each day. It gave us a chance to unwind, meet the other guests and chat with the hotel about where to go next and share our experiences of the day. The hotel owner mingled with the guests and was a delight to meet. The hotels location is superb. Quiet as not to disturb but literally a 10 minute walk to the main sites such as Blue Mosque, Aya Sofa, Topkapi Palace. The tram stop as mentioned earlier will take you to Grand Bazaar or across Galat Bridge should you wish to venture up to Galat Tower and Taksim Square.

The location is within the old city, within walking distance to major tourist attractions. The tram is a very convenient and inexpensive way to get to other parts of the city, and the tram stop is less than a block from the hotel. One note about the location: some taxi drivers did not know the name of the hotel or the name of the street, and at least one was unable to find the entrance even when shown on a map, presumably because of one-way streets and traffic patterns in the area. The breakfast buffet was exceptional, with a large variety of both Turkish and \"western\" dishes. Other than breakfast, we did not eat in the restaurants.

( It is very likely that the level of attention you will receive throughout your stay at the Hotel will make you feel a special guest right from the start; I felt it, and judging from the reviews, I gather this is customary, yet, something that is seriously undermined both at check-in procedures and thereafter in the majority of chain hotels.) The hotel is exceptionally clean and the room we were given, which was facing the back, was indeed very quiet. Having been accommodated in a twin room, I found the room spacious enough for two people. (I agree that this description is relative.) The bed was comfortable, if you do not like the pillow provided you will have an option to choose a pillow (from a range of pillows) and request one with a call to the reception. (Example photos of a room you see on the web are what you will see when you arrive there.) Both the bathroom and the bath tub are indeed spacious enough to accommodate two people, but you should not expect to be able to perform wrestling- free style... for that you have to get a room with a jacuzzi. Some soaps in the bathroom were natural and made of olive oil. Flat screen TV on the wall- of course, in the living room. (You may say \"this is standard\"... Surely not... Many rooms at a 5-star hotel \"Dan Panorama\" in Haifa, in Jun/09 still had 90s box TVs, the same goes for Holiday Inn, Place Wilson in Toulouse, France. I was in both of them.) Breakfast was truly exceptional!... You can assuage your pangs of hunger with one (or more) from an en-suite variety of fresh cheeses (white/yellow), choices of salami, olives, fruits, sweets, yogurt, and cherry tomatoes. You will also find a selection of fried choices: sausages; scrambled eggs; boiled eggs. The number of bread types will please bread-lovers, together with croissant and mini simits - sesame seed sprinkled Turkish bagle. There was even a honey comb on a frame (as if taken straight from the hive). So, whether you aspire for a quick (cereal) breakfast, a slimfood one, or one that will keep you full till the afternoon tea there is an opportunity for all. In the afternoon, from 16-18.30, at the entrance lounge, you will find free refreshments comprised of tea, Turkish simit -bagel- and apples. The fish restaurant is worth trying and it is renowned. There is a PC-terminal with a colour printer, both of them worked (and I used them) and the latter always had paper in it- a point I cannot miss! There is a swimming pool, if you fancy a stroke or two, but I did not have a time for that. The hotel is situated within a minute from Gulhane tram stop, and within a walking distance from the main tourist attractions, starting from the Topkapi Palace, about some of which you will be debriefed upon your arrival. The neighbourhood is safe, crowded well after mid-night, with quite a number of souvenir, carpet and gourmet shops within 1-2 min walk. All in all, a boutique hotel, which will raise the bar of your positive experiences you have modelled from your stays at hotels or, it will set an unreachable bar for some time to come for the hotels you are yet to experience. If you can (afford) it I would definitely recommend it. All staff at the reception were professional, approachable and accommodating, but I would single out, Agah Alkan, for a special cordial thank you. One final point, which pleased me immensely and gave me a taste that I am coming home, though an expensive one ;), every time I entered the hotel. A point that I found quite unorthodox, when compared with 5-star-hotel tradition. Essentially, the door at the entrance is not an automatic door, but a manual one with a handle. It is a stylish door. So you enter the hotel like you enter your house. That was a surprise to me, but one I really liked.

The rooms are reasonable in size, although we found the bathroom to be very small. The tram line and one of the main streets is just a block or two away. Unfortunately, to get there it is necessary to pass a carpet shop with a persistent and aggressive salesman who is always out front, ensuring that any foray into the city begins with annoyance. On the positive side, when he hassles you on the way back, you'll forget about it soon enough after you've passed under the warm and welcoming sign at the hotel's front door. The breakfast buffet is excellent; the staff graciously invited us to partake even though we arrived four hours ahead of normal check-in time (they had a room ready for us as well).

Reception friendly, with the welcoming Chai/Apple Tea & Dilhan gave us all the maps/transportation guide. Room booked was the basic Double but we ended up in a 3 bedded twin on the 1st floor, probably this was better as we had more overall room. Bathroom Size fine & had everthing in it. There is no real view from lower floors, just the old ramparts into the Park, & other readers are correct, the immediate vicinity is not inspiring. Room also felt hot, AC controls complicated, so we preferred to open the Windows to cool down the room. Beds were comfortable. The Sirkeci is a small Hotel but benefits from this by a more improved direct personal service that this enables them to provide. Being small they seem interested in how our day went & this type of dialogue/banter is welcoming. We wanted to go to Prens Leather shop, when we arrived some national holiday meant the Grand Bazaar was shut, however the Receptionist called to establish when they would be open & pointed their location on our Map. On our last day the Receptionist told us how to use the Tram/Metro back to the Airport (only 3 TL per person!) & checked us in for our flight home & made sure that the Seats we had allocated to us on SWISS were what we wanted. He also recommended the real old Turkish Bath for us to use, Cemberlitas Hamami nr the Grand Bazaar, & gave us the pamphlet.. We both had a great time, you must really do this providing you aren't too bashful, it's the one open from 1584, so I suppose they must know what they are doing by now! Have the fresh Pomegramette Juice afterwards, it's really refreshing. I had left my razor at home, & whilst the Hotel would have supplied me with one, I preferred to go to the Barber Shop across the Street for a proper Wet Shave. Great experience that one chaps! Ended up having the \"Full Service\" & hey ho I really enjoyed it, went back another time for just the shave (was in IST 3 nights) & ended up chatting with the Barber about Turkish Football, our English Premiership & life in general. For you Footie fans he's Galatasaroy...... We had booked a 3 nite arrangement & took advantage of the AP pick up, the free dinner, & the 11% discount by paying Cash on arrival. You only get this by booking directly with them on their Web Site so it's probably worthwhile doing this if your arrangements are 3 nites or more. The Dinner at the Hotel was excellent & good quality presentation. We did venture out the other Nites, Orient Express, again excellent is around the corner, & terrace restauarant was nice although the view was spoilt. Emminou perhaps better for more local experience, we went to a Terrace restaurant to Kebab Restaurant again with just superb views all over the Goldern Horn. The spa area we used for 2 out of our 3 nites, nice Turkish Bath, fit for purpose to soothe tired legs after all the walking around all the Sites. Breakfast Buffet was excellent, lots of Hot & Cold Choice, but I'm not a Hot Buffet fan, I'm sure the Cook would fry you some eggs, perhaps the Hotel could have presented this as an available option. Us Brits don't always ask! The location is the selling point. You can easily walk to Sirkeci & Eminnou (Ferry Stop) or up a small incline to Sultanmhet where the Cistern, Aya Sophia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi & Grand Bazaar . Everything listed here European side is a 15 min walk, Tram rides are (1.5 TRY say \u00c2\u00a30.80) so public transport is Cheap.

We were very disappointed. The Sirkeci Konak is more like a bed and breakfast establishment than a hotel. We were given a free transfer from the airport on arrival as part of the package we booked on the internet. I was told that a hotel representative would be waiting, holding a placard with my name on it, as we exited someone called my name, I answered in the affirmative and the next thing I knew this person took my bags and started walking as fast as he could with my luggage without introducing himself, if it were not for the fact that I was travelling with my husband and son in law I would have been terrified, he took us to an unmarked vehicle and then proceed to drive like a maniac to the hotel without uttering one word and ignoring our questions. This was a very bad and scary introduction to the hotel. Can the hotel not afford to get their own vehicles? On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by Pellin and given delicious apple tea while check in was organised, I had specifically requested rooms on a high floor, but the rooms we were given were on the second floor, the room was really small, one of the smallest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in, the bathroom was even smaller, there was no way my husband and I could fit in the bathroom together, the walls were paper thin we could hear every time the people in the adjacent room used their bathroom or toilet and all the sounds that go with bodily functions. The room overlooked the street below and from 6.30 in the morning the noise started, shopkeepers opening their shutters, the hotel is located in a very non touristy part of the old city, surrounded by shops selling motor car parts. This certainly did not put us in a good mood, having our sleep disturbed by the street sounds. At night if a rowdy group of people walked on the road the noise would disturb us. The choice of TV channels was pathetic as they were mostly in Turkish. The thin walls meant that everytime guests in the other room used their TV the sound disturbed us. The location of the hotel is not the best, yes, it is walking distance to most tourist sites if you are very fit, the walk to the Grand Bazaar is mostly an uphill hike, would not recommend the hotel to older guests. On a positive note breakfast was very good with a good selection of hot and cold dishes, however on an extremely unpleasant note, Dilhan who I am assuming is the guest relations manager would come into breakfast every morning and greet the guests, on the four mornings we were there she made a point of greeting all the guests except my family, it was extremely embarrassing for us, on another occasion when we wanted some help with regards to the Bosphorous cruise she was extremely irritated by my request and assisted us in a very rude manner. Was this discrimination because we were non white? Pellin and Yogi were wonderful, however Dilhan's attitude left a very sour taste in our mouths, would I return to the Sirkeci Konak? An emphatic no! Would I recommend the hotel to my friends and family and other members of tripadvisor?

The location is near all the main tourist sites. However the area is really old Istanbul and at night not great. The street is populated mainly with shops for car parts if that helps. The streets aren't threatening in any way but a bit seedy and lots (and I mean lots) of touts that can get pretty pushy sometimes for restaurants etc. The Taksim area would be a more cosmopolitan area to stay perhaps if that's what you want and the public transport system very easy to use to come over to the tourist sites.

These have terraces and views of the Bosphorus as well as the gardens. Rule of thumb guide - the lower the floor, the lesser the view. Dinner in the hotel, provided free on the first night, was really excellent, with no restrictions on what we could select from the menu. Turkish wine is quite expensive (high taxes), but we found the Egea Cabernet & Merlot to be of high quality. The room and (smallish) bathroom were both clean and very comfortable, with a choice of pillow types. There was free Wi-Fi - ask reception for the Code. The breakfast buffet was plentiful with a good selection on offer. Most of the attractions are within a 5 - 15 minute walk. We found the Topkapi Palace was the most interesting place to visit (but avoid changing currency at the entrance), followed by the Bazaars. Not much hassling either, but beware the usual 'Carpet traps'! If Marakesh scores 8/10 for hassling, then I would mark Istanbul at 2/10. The people are genuinely friendly for a city with a population of 17 million, and seem to want to practice their English, chatting to you in the street without any ulterior motive other than to be helpful. We found this a pleasant surprise, and one we did not expect. If you complete the sights with time to spare, ask reception to arrange a half day boat trip, which was well worth doing, providing a whole new dimension of interest. If you can arrange to pay your bill in cash, you can get a considerable discount. Our bill was shaved by 11%, which would be worth making a few trips to the plentiful ATMs. This was a highly enjoyable - even relaxing - stay at the Sirkeci Konak.

Beautiful tile work and furniture adorn their public spaces. Since we stayed more than 3 nights, we were able to take advantage of a complimentary ride from the airport to the hotel. Our plane was late in arriving, but our ride was there waiting for us. We also received a complimentary meal in the main dining room. There was just a short wait to check in, so we relaxed with cold waters that were offered to us, checked in, which went very smoothly, then taken to our room. Our room was very clean and comfortable- good beds and pillows, roomy enough. I would have liked the bathroom to have been a little bigger; it felt cramped and there was very little shelf space. The shower had good water pressure and the water was hot so that made up for shortcomings of the bathroom. The breakfast buffet was fully stocked with hot and cold choices of food items and it all tasted very good. I loved the rooftop terrace, not only for the views, but also for the dining experience it offered. They serve drinks on the terrace also. We had a seafood meal one evening which was very good. There was one computer on the ground level for people to use, but I never had a problem with other people using the computer when I wanted to use it. I liked the location of the hotel because it was near all the major sites and within walking distance. This hotel was a little bit of a splurge for us, but it was worth it to me. It's the little things that made it so- the staff offering shawls on a chilly night while enjoying the rooftop terrace- being so prompt in bringing us ice for our drinks- and not just a few cubes, the friendliness of the staff. They allowed us to leave our Istanbul purchases with them while we traveled around Turkey and we collected our things when we returned 10 days later. I liked the size of the hotel. It was a small, intimate place to stay in a quiet location, so it didn't have that typical hotel feel about it. I loved it here and would definitely go back for the comfort, great location, friendly and helpful staff, rooftop views and great dining.

Palin took a genuine interest in how we had enjoyed our day, and gave us enthusiastic advice about what to see and where to eat. She obviously enjoyed her job, and it was a pleasure to chat with her; her advice was excellent to boot. Twice a week, they provide a Turkish cooking class, gratis, to hotel guests.

My wife and I spent 4 nights here during our honeymoon and it was worth every penny! On arriving at the Ataturk Airport, a driver sent from the hotel was already waiting for us. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were sat down at reception and given the usual information and a handful of really good maps and brochures. Afterwards we were shown to our room, a deluxe room with a balcony (Room 1407). The room was absolutely immaculate. I felt like I was a Turkish movie star with a lavish apartment in the center of the city. We arrived late into Istanbul that night, but we still decided to redeem our free dinner coupon at the in-hotel restaurant. However, we didn't eat from all the courses as we weren't too hungry after all our travleing around. It was a wonderfully kind gesture that the people at the restaurant there allowed us to redeem the coupon at a later date when we would have more of an appetite. A few other pluses: --Breakfast was included with our room and has a very great variety, not just in foods, but in hours of service, as well. You could wake up at 1030am and still make it in time for breakfast. --Wireless internet was complimentary, the way it should be at a nice hotel. --Turkish delight, a fruit plate and bottles of water in the room, free of charge. --Free use of sauna, turkish bath, swimming pool and weight room. The staff--to include the housemaids--are extremely helpful and very humble, not looking down their noses at you like in some other European hotels I've been to. The location is second to none, within short walking distance of Topkapi Palace, Grand Bazaar, Haghia Sophia and the Blue Mosque. A good travel tip: If you follow the metro lines you won't get lost as easily. It's once you start wandering into alleys and side streets that you get disorientated. Finally, today we experienced the fastest, most efficient hotel check-out ever.

I'm glad he did, because the Sirkeci Konak proved to be a delight. (And they have testimonials from Trip Advisor posted prominently in the lobby, so we're obviously not the only people to think so). The room was air-conditioned, spacious, clean, and comfortable, decorated in a not-over-the-top Turkish theme, and looked out into the gardens of Topkapi Palace. The bathroom was modern and pristine. And the location is great; walking distance to all the \"usual suspects\" - Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, etc. But most of all, I would recommend the hotel for the warmth and helpfulness of the staff; the manager and the concierge were not only professional but friendly, and we truly felt like guests rather than customers. Other pluses: the hotel will arrange a pickup at the airport, for about 20 euros. For a stay of 3 nights or more, it's complimentary. Also, in the summer months, the hotel has a rooftop dining room specializing in local seafood; sitting up there, listening as the muezzins all across the city called out at sunset (it was Ramadan), watching the sun slide behind minarets...astonishing! And the food and service were wonderful. One more, unrelated Istanbul tip: we hired a private guide for a full-day walking tour of the city, to see some of the places we wouldn't be seeing with our cruise group.

On arrival we were offered drinks, we were given a map and shown exactly where all the sights, restaurants, boat trips etc were. The staff were very knowledgeable and pointed us in the right direction for everything that we asked about. We ate in the roof top restaurant on the first night which was really good, and set the standard for all the following nights food. It wasn't the most expensive restaurant we ate in, the 360O restaurant was, which was recommended by the hotel and was very good for a different flavour of Istanbul, very modern, quite hard to find, get a taxi there! We also went on a boat trip, we opted for the private boat trips which meant we could stop anywhere and they would wait for you, this again was advised by the hotel, we stopped at Ortakoy and had probably our best lunch in a restaurant called Poussin it has a roof top terrace which is just lovely looking over the harbour, highly recommended. The hotel has a gym, and a small spa which has a pool, turkish bath and sauna, we used these facilities and found it relaxing at the end of a hard days sight seeing. Another review points out that the hotel isn't in a pretty street, but we found the hotel to be in a great location, we didn't feel threatened in any way, and its just a short walk up the hill to all the main restaurants, bars and shops etc. , its just in a back street, it has a lovely Turkish delight shop opposite and a cafe, that sells the usual tea and coffee to the locals, who yes, sell car parts, but hey they live here! There was friendly banter by all the locals as you walk up the road, but nothing a smile couldn't sort out, and anyway what do you expect in Istanbul!! There is a tram stop just up the road from the hotel, and its a great way of getting around, and very cheap, they are also airconditioned. The grand bazaar is an experience!! the spice market is interesting, and the mosques amazing, overall we had a brilliant experience in Istanbul, and I believe it was due to the hotels location and the staff who were exceptionally knowledgeable and saved us a lot of time and effort in their recommendations.", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamburg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cOk, but not first choice\u201d", "Author": "ffd-travel", "ReviewID": "UR35951063", "Content": "I must say that I do not understand the rocket ratings that this hotel received here.

However once you get inside, the property opens up and you might be lucky enough to be greeted by one of the friendlier receptionists there. I can't remember his name but he had floppy dark hair and always seemed to be smiling. The rooms were fine for the three nights we were there, however my daughter had the misfortune to be next to the cleaner's cupboard. Now, I would hazard a guess that hotel cleaners ought to start work no earlier than 9am. I think that's a reasonable time, but not at this hotel. Daughter was woken two mornings by the cleaners banging around in their cupboard at 7am, which is taking enthusiasm for their to the extreme at the cost of guests' sleep. It's a shame that this enthusiasm didn't extend to their cleaning abilities; they did the absolute minimum, for example, we were given a glass of water when we arrived. We took the half empty glasses to our room and there they stayed for the rest of our time at the hotel - not touched or moved. It seemed to us that they just did the absolute basic and if they could start as early as possible, all the better. I know that one might expect to hear the odd bit of plumbing during a stay, but the sound of the room above us flushing their loo or having a shower did take us by surprise on the first night - it was so loud that we thought something had gone terribly wrong in our bathroom. The manageress greeted us on our arrival, then forgot us the next day and re-introduced her self. She asked if we had had a good day in the city but as we were literally mid-sentence she stopped us to greet new guests, fair enough but her manner was very rude and off hand. All that said, the food served was top-notch and the presentation was great, no complaints at all. A nice touch was a daily newsletter on your breakfast table with little announcements and facts. To sum up, if you want a great location and fab food but can put up with noisy waterworks, staff that are slightly remote and cleaners that have no concept of time, then get booking! As an aside, we loved all the sights Istanbul had to offer (who wouldn't?), but be warned, the Topkapi Palace is a bit pricey with an extra entrance fee for the Harem.

Our no hassle experience was worth every penny. We paid cash and received a discount on the room rate (150 Euros instead of 165 Euros). I have paid more elsewhere for much less! The staff is so polite, helpful and AVAILABLE. Room size average but spotlessly clean, quiet, modern bathroon with bathrobes and the twin beds were perfect. You even have a choice of pillows. The sheets and towels were changed daily. Many hotels don't change the sheets each day. The airconditioning worked perfectly.

Other touches that make the SK special are the free welcome dinner if you book over 3 nights and a free transfer to or from the airport, free tea in the afternoons in the lobby area, and the Guest Relations manager Pelin. All in all, the SK may not be the poshest or grandest hotel I have ever stayed at, but if I could have my ideal hotel anywhere around the world, it would be a copy of the Sirkeci Konak. I speak for all our party (my partner, parents and mother in law) when I say that what makes the Sirkeci Konak hotel truly stand out is its staff and the fantastic atmosphere they have managed to create. We would recommend it to anyone without a moments hesitation, you will definitely not regret it.", "Date": "June 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cGo yourself, and see why we all love Sirkeci Konak\u201d", "Author": "ccmanly", "ReviewID": "UR32339635", "Content": "This hotel really is special, and as so many reviews have noted, it is the people - there is a sincerity and generosity of spirit that makes guests feel very welcome.

It was such a nice experience, I have to write about it! The hotel itself is in the old town conveniently located next to a tram stop and walking distance to pretty much most of the attractions. I'd say its a reasonable size for the hotels in the area and is very clean, simple and traditionally decorated. We had a twin room which didn't have the best view but, had all the mod cons and the beds were sooo comfortable, I slept soundly on all 4 nights. We dined in the restaurant and had room service a few times. I thought the food was really nice, I definitely recommend the sea bass. Turker was a great host at dinner on our first night and also at teatime in the lobby where you could have snacks and tea and chat to the other guests and staff. I loved the Apple tea and Sedat was kind enough to give me my own pack! It doesn't taste the same when I make it though! Breakfast was also a nice affair, there was such a large selection of goodies and Mohammed and the girls were always on hand when you needed more tea. My only dissappointment was I was expecting to have breakfast on the roof terrace. The basement contains the fitness centre, sauna, pool and hammam and it was lovely to be able to go for a swim at the end of a hard day of sightseeing. It was very clean and well maintained. All the guys at reception, Okay, Gorkem and Serker were on hand to help with any queries and bookings for excursions and were just generally pleasant as were Birol and Engin and the other guys who's names I cant remember. This was one of the best things at the hotel, the staff are approachable and are really attentive without being overbearing. The jewel in the crown though, is Pellin. She is a real asset to the hotel and was so helpful. She made us feel really welcome and practically sorted our itinerary for us whilst we were there. Every hotel should have a Pellin! So, to conclude, If you look at the hotel in terms of walls and a place to sleep, its probably not very different to the other hotels out there. What makes this hotel is the staff, from reception to housekeeping, everyone did their best to make you feel comfortable and at home.

Breakfast was substantial with plenty of cereals, fruits, yogurts, hot foods and cheeses, the best we had in Turkey. Free internet access was a nice touch as was complimentary high tea in the late afternoon - sandwiches and Turkish tea.

We really liked the fact that this Istanbul hotel was in an area that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t chock full of tourists and heavily laden attractions. All of the attractions are within walking distance and our Istanbul hotel has a nice rooftop restaurant with some good food and a pub restaurant as well. The swimming pool is an indoor one with its own changing rooms, handy since I really hate walking through a nice hotel sopping wet. There is also a doctor on staff at the hotel and from what I could tell, the medical services were pretty quick to respond to a call as one of the guests twisted their ankle and needed it seen to. We booked our rooms online at www.istanbulbooker.com, and our flights at www.thy.com We enjoyed the Old City and the attractions there and we even ventured as far as the Galata Tower. Some of the museums are totally unique to this part of the world and no visit to Istanbul is complete until you visit the Grand Bazaar.

We were impressed as soon as we walked through the door. Our host, Pelin Nasoz (the Customer Relations Manager) welcomed us immediately and showed us to the lounge area where she sat us down and ordered tea and sandwiches for us while she took us through the checking in process, and then went on to provide a map of Istanbul, describing what we might like to do and where it all was. In the meantime, our cases were taken up to our room. Great start! The room was compact, although the bed was large. It was spotlessly clean and very comfortable, with everything you could possibly want including the usual complimentary tray, mini bar, dressing gowns and slippers (useful for the leisure suite). The bathroom was great too with underfloor heating, but beware that the showers are so powerful, it could almost blast you out of the bath! The location of this hotel was superb. The street it was in was fairly quiet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly at night as it is located more in a commercial area with a number of car spares shops around.

The hotel is also located a two minute walk from a tram stop, and 5 minutes from the railway station. Most of the main attractions eg Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar are easily accessible by foot. We enjoyed using the very clean leisure facility, comprising a fitness suite, swimming pool, sauna and Turkish bath. The meals were excellent. Plenty of choice for all tastes for breakfast, and the evening meals too were very enjoyable. There is a good selection of restaurants in the vicinity, including this hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sister (three minutes walk) which has a top floor restaurant where the views are quite good over the Bosphorous. Tip: The hotel offers an airport transfer service for 24 Euros one way. We were warned that some taxi drivers have an elastic interpretation of the appropriate fare; they should cost about 35TL \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so the hotel rate is very fair. To sum up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I could find no fault with this hotel whatsoever; highly recommended. I would not hesitate to stay here again .

Everything positive written about this hotel is true so I will try not to be redundant. Rooms: We got a very good rate on this hotel through booking.com. We stayed for 3 nights in a regular room and then were upgraded to the superior room simply because we asked. The superior room is on the top (5th) floor and it clears the bldg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in front. We had park views and a glimmer of the water. The room also has a king sized bed and large balcony. If you have a choice between the two- I would def pay more for the larger room. The standard rooms are fairly small albeit very comfortable. We were on the 4th floor in the standard room with a small balcony. It was an ok view but I would NOT have liked to be any lower than that. The shower pressure was great and the rooms were warm. I note that because it was freezing outside. I traveled through Europe in December and a lot of the hotel rooms did not provide adequate heat. Rest assured, you will be toasty! Location: Walk to all the historic sites, grand bazaar etc. The street the hotel is on is not pretty. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located across the street from Kamal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car shop. You will get over this though. One thing you should note before you go is that the hotel is hard to find. Every cab driver we had could NOT find the hotel- especially at night. After the second day or so when you have an idea of the area, you will be able to guide the cab drivers like we did. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually not hard to find but it seemed to confuse the drivers. Service: I need to comment on the service of this hotel because truly, in all my travels, I have never had such a warm and helpful staff. They were on a first name basis with us on day 2. Pelin is magnificent. If I owned a hotel I would want someone like her working for me. Food: Breakfast was amazing and we loved the afternoon tea time. Overall, I would advise to leave the Sultanahmet area at night (it was dead) and venture to other more lively neighborhoods for dinner. We had our best two meals at 360 restaurant and at Mikla (located in the Marmara Pera hotel). Both are chic restaurants that boast a stylish crowd. Amazingly enough, both actually serve fine food as well. I only say that because we were given restaurant recommendations that were not very good. Both 360 and Mikla give you the ambiance and the food. Also check out the Bebek neighborhood as it also has a nice scene at night. We had cocktails at trendy Lucca and dinner at Lulu. Ask the locals about Pelit. Its THE BEST chocolate place I have ever encountered. Better chocolate than Demel in Vienna. I only knew about it because my boyfriend is from Istanbul and his family requested him to bring chocolate back from there. The one we went to is in Yesikloy (near the airport) but there are others in Istanbul. I am pretty sure there is one in Bebek and also Levent. The chocolate covered Turkish delights are one of their specialties. What not to do: Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to the malls. It was pouring rain one day and I wanted to be indoors so I went to both Kanyon Mall and Cevahir Mall. There is nothing there that you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get in the US for cheaper. It was a waste of time! Safety: I was alone during the day while my bf worked. I walked to all the sites and yes, men did bother me but it was more annoying than anything else. I just ignored them. Always count your change. I gave 20 Lira to get into one of the sites and the cashier didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to give me the 5 lira back until I asked him to. Also many of the cab drivers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give you enough change back- they did this to us three times- until my bf asked for the change.

I will not further commend the excellent customer relations service from the collection at the airport to the meet and greet and the first class service of Pelin and her colleagues. They are great. However, I like to consider everything. Unless you are on the top floor of the hotel you do not have a view of Gulhane Park. The hotel overlooks several 'motor factor' distributors. At night they are all shuttered with blank facades. So unless you are on the top floor this is your outlook. As previous correspondents have commented the rooms are on the small side again the more exclusive rooms are bigger. The swimming pool is cold and unless a cold dip is required after a sauna it was not for me. I did not see anyone using it.

Not that inferior altered touristic food you can find easily everywhere. The Konak Hotel certainly contributed to a fantastic city trip! The Turks are very nice and warm people.

My focus, like other recent reviewers, will be on the absolutely phenomenal hospitality we were shown by everyone (repeat: everyone) on the hotel staff. From the time we entered and were offered drinks and food (the famous afternoon tea), to the time we left with our hosts waving to us from the front door, we felt like true guests, instead of like paying inhabitants that most hotels make one feel. While Pelin has, and very accurately, been singled out for compliments by other reviewers, she is only one component of a team that works hard, but seemingly effortlessly, to ensure that all guests not only enjoy their stay at the hotel, but also appreciate the majesty and history that is Istanbul. And the downright fun that is Istanbul, too. How many other hotel staff invite a guest and his wife to accompany them to an important football match (soccer game)? They not only did, but also gave them a lift in their personal vehicle and provided the appropriate club (team) tee shirts! My husband and I have traveled fairly extensively, both on business and for enjoyment. I cannot think of another hotel in which our stay was so absolutely pleasant.

I'm glad to say that my stay at Sirkeci Konak was wonderful. I am quite picky about hotels and the room they first gave me looked out onto some ventilation fans and hence was a bit noisy ( I am very fussy about noise, but I doubt anyone else would have noticed the fans). So I asked for a room change and the staff obliged immediately and transfered my luggage for me too. The staff are the epitome of Turkish friendliness and hospitality, they found out it was my birthday while we were staying there are they brought me a cake with candles and even a present! To top it all off, they took some photos and sent someone running to get them developed to be able to give it to me when we checked out (half an hour later). Location wise, it's very convenient and central. The rooms are beautiful and my friend raved on about the bathrooms for several days after! The breakfast buffet is good, the creamiest and best yoghurt I've ever tasted and the great thing is that there are many turkish specialities on offer too. The only minor downside is that unlike some hotels in Istanbul they don't have a terrace with a view to the blue mosque but they have a roof terrace which overlooks the palace gardens and will lend you binoculars to look over the golden horn. Furthermore for the standard of accommodation and service you get, I'm more than willing to have a drink somewhere else to enjoy the view of the blue mosque.

The Sirkeci Konak is more expensive than many of its Sultanahmet competitors, but we believed that we got our money's worth. The hotel's location is excellent. It is 50 meters from the Gulhane tram stop (on the main tram line), a 10 minute walk from Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, and the Archaeological Museum in one direction, and the Golata Bridge and Eminonu boat docks in the other direction. It is located on a quiet street (filled for the most part with auto part stores, which never seemed to be very busy) along the walls of Gulhane Park (the park that surrounds Topkapi Palace. You get a nice view of the park from the hotel's upper floors and rooftop restaurant. The hotel's rooms were not huge, but large enough and clean, with modern bathrooms, wood floors, cable TV, and Wifi internet access. The hotel has a very attractive lobby area, with comfortable seating and a small bar, where they serve tea and snacks every afternoon. In the basement, there is a small swimming pool, as well as a sauna, exercise room, and hammam (Turkish bath). Our daughter loved the swimming pool, which was very clean and heated. One of the hotel's most underrated features are its excellent restaurants, which we dined in multiple times. One restaurant specializes and seafood and is located on the rooftop in the summer, while the other restaurant serves a wider variety of Turkish dishes and is located off the lobby. Of the two, the seafood restaurant is more expensive. We actually preferred the food in the non-seafood restaurant.

I chose it because it had really good reviews on this site. As is usually the case, I found that the reviews gave an accurate picture of the hotel. The location is very good, within walkinfg distance to all the sites, even if the small road on which the hotel is located is quite drab (but you only have to walk two minutes on it). What I liked most about this hotel is the staff. They are all -without exception - extremely friendly and nice. They really give you personal attention and are very willing to help. I would rate the hotel facilities 4 stars. The common areas, while not being luxurious, are nice. I particularly enjoyed the wellness area, which has a beautiful, large Turkish bath all in marble, a nice swimming pool, and a fitness area that is definitely above average (very many four and even five stars hotels are deficient in terms of the fitaness room; not Sirkeci Konak). In October the rooftop terrasse was closed, so I tried only the ground floor restaurant. I ate there several times, it was good, and again, the staff are so nice that it's impossible not to like them! I had a standard room. It was tastefully decorated and the furniture was new. The bathroom was very nice. My only critique was that the wardrobe is a bit small, if you're travelling as a couple and have a lot of clothes, it might be a bit cramped. But these are small details. Breakfast is buffet, good quality. If I were to complain about something, it would be that during my stay, no fried eggs or scrambled eggs were served. However, I have not enquired, perhaps it might have been possible to order them. The breakfats included, among many other things, home-made tomato jam. Try it, it's really good. Another thing I would really recommend is trying the traditional Turkish massage, which involves an exfoliating scrub. Several people besides tried it and all enjoyed it very much and it's not expensive. You can ask the very pleasant and friendly young man working in the wellness center, he's easy to recognise because he's blond and looks Dutch or German (but isn't, he's Turkish). While staying there, the hotel arranged me a full day private tour with a guide (150 euro, very good quality) and booked a show (Dervish dance show - personally, I found it disappointing).

You can go to the last stop Kabatas and then take a bus and venture around. The people are extremely helpful if you are a tourist. To go to the airport..some take the Metro to the airport and if you take a taxi then it will come to around 35 to 38TYL. The hotel will organise it for you Beer (efes) usually cost around 2.5TYL and in Hotels/Restaurants costs about 5 to 7 TYL.The beer at the Hotel is reasonable The Spice Bazaar is great on pricing and if you are a cooking enthusiast then try kirkik ( red chilly) For turkish sweets there is one sweet shop opposite Park Hotel and its called Haci Bekir and they are supposed to be the best for Turkish sweets. A bit on the expensive side and try the double pistasio...ymmmm! By the way tasting is free. Try Kumpir their potato delight and is supposed to be best at a place called Ortakoy and nice place to walk around. In the afternoon there are cruises at Ortakoy ( behind the Mosque in the afternoon) and is only 7TYL per person for an hour and is worth it and then come back and try the Gozleme being baked by ladies. to go to Ortakoy..take the tram towards Kabatas, then from Kabatas catch the bus 22E or 25 to Ortakoy 61.

We returned on 18 September. First, location. The hotel is very close to the main sights (overlooks the gardens of Topkapi Palace) and you really couldn't be better placed for a sightseeing tour of Istanbul. It is only a matter of minutes to walk to the main sights, to the station (we arrived by rail), to the ferry terminal, to Sultanhamet square, etc., etc. The hotel itself is situated in a quiet side street, which is a bit scruffy looking, but no problem. The hotel itself is a haven of cool and tranquillity. Second, rooms. Do not book the Sirkeci if you want a huge room or are looking for the standard chain-type luxury hotel. This is very much a boutique hotel and the rooms differ in shape and size. Our two (we were two couples), were fine and overlooked Topkapi palace. We saw some at the back which did not have quite such a nice view. The rooms were spotless, and the bathrooms etc lovely. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. They even have a pillow menu for you to choose your own feather/down/foam pillow or whatever! The beds were very comfortable and the air-conditioning quiet and efficient. Third, food. We ate at the roof-top restaurant, which specialises in fish and which was lovely. We also ate at the restaurant downstairs on our last night and found the food there quite delicious, beautifully presented and was very Turkish rather than bland international cuisine. Breakfast was also good, lots of fresh fruit and cereals. Again, there was a real Turkish feel to the food, for example, fresh Turkish honeycomb, spinach tart. Fourth, customer service and general ambience. This is where the hotel is, in our experience, in a different league from other hotels we have stayed in around the world. The staff are all absolutely committed to ensuring you enjoy your stay in Istanbul. We arrived very tired from a two day rail trip overnight from Budapest. We were welcomed, offered breakfast (which we really needed!), then instead of checking in at reception, we were taken to the lounge where Pelin Nasoz, the delightful Guest Relations Manager, explained everything about the hotel. The staff went out of their way to get our rooms ready early (we checked in at 11.00 am, an hour earlier than we expected). Every afternoon tea, cold drinks and snacks are served to guests and Pelin asks about your day, and if there is anything she can help with. The staff are very knowledgeable and can help with all sorts of queries and book up trips, meals etc etc. It all felt very different from the usual, bland and rather faceless experience of major city hotels. To sum up, we would absolutely recommend this hotel, which thoroughly deserves it top position on Trip Advisor.", "Date": "September 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "silversurfer65", "ReviewID": "UR20146082", "Content": "Really lovely friendly hotel, great staff who were very welcoming and helpful in advising where to go what to see and how to get there.

The beds were large and comfortable and the rooms had all the usual things you would expect in a 4* hotel. One couple in our group did ask to change rooms as they were on the 2nd floor with not much of a view. They were moved to a higher floor the very next day as soon as a room became available, all done with a smile and no fuss. The food was lovely, a varied selection for breakfast ranging from toast and boiled egg, fruit, yogurt, sausage & scrambled egg, olives tomatoes, cucumber, cheese and fresh honeycomb. On our first evening we were entitled to free evening meal, which was great. I am a vegetarian (no meat or fish) and there was plenty for me to eat. The hotel provide tea in the afternoon when you are able to have lemonade and tiny sandwiches with either tomato and cucumber or soft cheese. Drinks were more expensive than in local bars, but that is true over here as well. The hotel is right in Istanbul Village with Topkapi, the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia just minutes walk away. 5-7 minutes walk in the other direction, past various bars and restaurants and you are at the sea front where you can catch a boat trip on the Bosphorus or just sit in a waterfront cafe and watch the world go by!

The breakfast buffet is excellent and should last most guests until dinner. The location is perfect.

The Grand Bazaar, the Spice Market and the Bosphorus ferries, while a bit farther, can be reached by foot in about 15 minutes. The nearest tram stop is only a five minute walk and we found that the easiest way to get to the somewhat more distant locations was to take a tram out of the congested areas and then get a taxi.

This hotel is ideally situated between the old city (Sultanahmet) and the modern city across the Golden Horn. The rooftop restaurant (good food) overlooks Gulhane Park and the walls of Topkapi Palace. The rooftop is a great place for a sundowner or alfresco meal. The complementary breakfast buffet offers plenty of variety, including Turkish specialties plus the familiar Euro-American standbys. On previous visits to Istanbul, we've stayed in pricier hotels, both Luxury category and \"Special\" category, but none offered better value than Sirkeci Konak. The rooms here are relatively small, but there is a significant difference between various rooms on each floor - when you reserve, ask for one of the larger-sized rooms. Bathrooms are modern, clean, and well-equipped. The hotel does not have an outdoor swimming pool, but there is a small indoor pool, a hamam (steam bath), and a massage studio (open by appointment only), so there are multiple options for relaxing and de-stressing in a clean, uncrowded facility. The hotel staff was extremely helpful and friendly (a characteristic of Turkey in general). We requested airport transportation with our reservation, and when we failed to find the expected driver at the airport (a traveling companion inadvertently \"stole\" our transport), a phone call to the hotel produced a fast solution: we took a commercial taxi to the hotel, and the hotel paid our cab fare on the spot, no charge to us. The hotel is on a little-known backstreet that cab drivers don't always know about; it's a good idea to carry a couple of the hotel-provided cards listing the address and phone on the front, and on the back a neighborhood map showing its exact location. On the plus side, neighborhood traffic is relatively light, especially after dark, so it's quiet and peaceful, by Istanbul standards, anyway. Even so, it's less than 100 paces from the hotel's front door to a major thoroughfare with shops, restaurants, ATM machines, foreign exchange bureaux, and even (if you insist) -- McDonald's and Burger King. Best of all, right on the corner is a tram stop that can take you (cheaply!) to the Grand Bazaar, Taksim, and many other attractions, in air-conditioned comfort.. Learn to use Istanbul's public transit -- It's a great way to avoid traffic jams.

It is also easily walkable to Grand Bazaar and the ferry terminals for crossing or cruising down, the Bosphorus. Although situated in a road where the Hotel seems at odds with what mainly seem to be car spare shops, this is not a distraction given the excellent position. The road is safe, clean (as was most of what we saw of Istanbul) and quiet. The Hotel itself is tastefully decorated, clean and with excellent facilities, including a terrace bar which was a haven both before venturing onto the streets in the morning and for a nightcap prior to retiring (look out for the herons in the park opposite). The (small but adequate) swimming pool was also great for a late afternoon dip to refresh after getting hot and tired from sightseeing. Breakfast offered a superb range of choice and for lunchtime or evening, the hotel's own restaurant offered better quality and value than many of the guide book recommended restaurants that we tried. Our standard room did not have a great view, but that was academic given that it was just for sleeping in. The room itself was spacious, clean and had all that was required. The bed was very comfortable and a choice of soft or hard pillow was available according to preference. All of the above notwithstanding, the Hotel's biggest asset is its staff. From arrival to departure you are treated like an individual and made to feel very welcome. Nothing is too much trouble and without exception, the staff are helpful, friendly, sociable and always smiling. I can best describe this as a \"happy\" hotel, which excels in customer satisfaction. We have stayed in many hotels in the course of our travels and in all honesty I can say that the Sirkeci Konak is up there with the best of them. The praise on TripAdvisor is well justified and I have no hestitation in endorsing the recommendations and looking forward to a return visit. Our only caveat , and this is not a reflection on the Hotel itself, is that when we last went to Turkey about 15 years ago, the cost of living was very cheap and you could eat and dine out for next to nothing. Times have changed and with the effects of inflation you can now expect to pay London prices during a stay in Turkey. However, this is not a reason to put off visiting this amazing city which has so much to offer with its history, culture and vitality.", "Date": "August 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel, Excellent Hosts\u201d", "Author": "adribaer", "ReviewID": "UR18775395", "Content": "We had a fantastic time at the Sirkeci Konak and recommend it to anyone traveling to Istanbul.

We started the trip with four nights in Istanbul at the Sirkeci Konak Hotel and it is clear to us why this hotel is number one on Trip Advisor in Istanbul. First we were met at the airport by an employee of the hotel who drove us back to the hotel in a car which had plenty of room for the four of us and all of our luggage. I had told my husband that the hotel was located on a small street with numerous shops selling auto parts, so we were prepared for the unusual setting of this otherwise elegant hotel. Like previous guests have mentioned, we were offered apple tea when we arrived and we checked in sitting on a couch. Pelin, the guest services employee, gave us a map of Istanbul and told us what attractions would be closed on which days. We then had a complimentary dinner in the downstairs restaurant with traditional Turkish food (there is also an excellent fish restaurant on the roof). The bedrooms and bathrooms were immaculate. The rooms have an Ottoman design, which reminds you that you are in Istanbul, not in some generic hotel room. The bathrooms were marble and were large enough to be comfortable. Complimentary tea is served every day at 5:00, if you are at the hotel at this time. There is an exercise room, small pool and steam room, as well as a Turkish bath and other types of massages offered on the premises. The Turkish Bath is an experience you must try, and it was very convenient to do it at the hotel, so we could stumble upstairs - all of our muscles relaxed - when we were done. The staff is extremely helpful, from giving directions, ordering a taxi, making dinner reservations, checking times of Bosphorus cruises, etc., etc. They also speak very good English, which is not always easy to find in Turkey. Pelin would check on us from time to time to see if we needed anything. The breakfast buffet is excellent, although it is of course Turkish food, not eggs, bacon and French toast. Of all the hotels we visited in Turkey, it had by far the best breakfast buffet. The fish restaurant on the roof - only open in summer - is really top notch. Not only is the food delicious but you also have great views of the Gold Horn. It is not inexpensive by Turkish standards, but we also ate more expensive meals in other parts of Turkey, which were not nearly as good. By U.S. standards, the prices were reasonable. There is also a comfortable lounge area on the first floor of the hotel, where you can take your tea or have something stronger. We spent an enjoyable evening in the lounge watching the Euro 2008 soccer finale with other guests from all over Europe. The only negative point (a very minor one) which is not the fault of the hotel nor within its control, is that our rooms faced a somewhat unattractive lot behind the hotel. You might request an upper level room facing the park. Finally, as previous guests have said, this hotel is very well-located. You can walk to most of the major sites very easily and the tram, which is very user friendly especially if you don't take it at rush hour, is a short block from the hotel.

We, who travel the world, found the Sirkeci Konak to be one of the nicest hotels we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in. You do not have to stay in a big, expensive 5 star hotel to be pampered and doted upon. The service is just as, if not more, important than the size of the room or elevator. The people on Trip Advisor who wrote negative reviews are either very fussy and hard to please or not world travelers. You have to remember, this is not America or the UK. From the minute we walked into this charming boutique hotel, we knew it would be great. By the time we checked in, the Guest Relations Managers , Ms. Menekse Goker and Ms. Pellin Nasoz came up and greeted us, gave us their business cards and told us if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anything we need to just let them know. Our private tour guide met us at the hotel and he told us he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never seen anything like it before. He thought it was impressive. Before we finished checking in, we each received a glass of apple tea \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which was delicious. Menekse noticed how much we raved about the unusual apple tea that, before I knew what was happening, she presented me with a packet of the tea to take home. The location is perfect \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nice and quiet. As we had a private tour guide, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about how to get around, but the hotel is near all the major sites that you can even walk to. Our room was just like the pictures we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen. Decorated lovely and with a welcome dish of Turkish Delight waiting on the bed for us. There was a little card on the night stand with a selection of about six or seven different pillow types to choose from, if we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like what was on the bed (it was a good firm pillow). The bathroom was very clean. You have to watch out, though, because when you step out of the bathtub, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a high step, so you have to hold on. But we found that most European hotels have bathtubs like that. There were also nice amenities in the bathroom. If you stay in the hotel for more than three nights, you receive a complimentary dinner. Well, we did, and it was just delicious. We had the typical Turkish meal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mezeh (appetizers), main course of lamb, which was soft as butter, and then a delicious dessert. Menekse and Pellin and even the owner of the hotel, Mr. Faruk Boyaci, came over and joined us for dinner. It was quite a treat! They were all so warm and welcoming. There was a huge buffet breakfast, consisting of a dozen types of bread or rolls, fresh and dried fruit, fruit juices (including cherry juice), a big bowl of Turkish Delight and Halvah, a selection of cold cuts, cheeses, fresh vegetables, a selection of olives, yogurts, jams, and the hot selections of either scrambled or hard boiled eggs, a vegetable quiche and eggs with vegetables, sausage and bacon, plus coffee and the famous Turkish apple tea. There is a little reception in the afternoon, but we were out touring and did not participate. The breakfast is served in the main restaurant, but there is a second fish restaurant, where you can pick your own fresh fish. It looked good, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to eat there. Even though we did not utilize it, there is a Turkish Hamam downstairs with a sauna, pool and fitness center. It looked very inviting, but there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t time. They even have complimentary internet service. When the weather permits, you can dine on the rooftop patio, which is charming. The staff was very nice and helpful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from the bellhops to the waiters. Everyone was so warm and welcoming they made you feel like family. We feel that we have made new friends in Turkey.

In addition, many of the staff speak very good english, which is invaluable when the turkish language will appear almost unfathomable to the average brit. We stayed over the Turkish GP weekend, and their ability to organise transport for us and other guests to get to the circuit, was a godsend, although tolerating the journey back in a minibus for 2 hours through some of the densest and most chaotic traffic I have ever seen was not an experience I would necessarily choose.

However, I would not want to miss recommending this hotel to other potential guests. I myself have benefited so much from user reviews. I booked on the hotel's webpage and received a prompt reply in a most welcoming tone. I knew immediately that I had chosen a very friendly place. Ms Petek Goker, Guest Relations Manager, went out of her way to help me finding the best connection from Istanbul to Bergama. We entered into a longer correspondence, and when I arrived I was welcomed with tea and like an old friend. The hotel is in a prime location, ca. 15-20 minutes walking from both the railway station and Topkapi Palace/Hagia Sophia. If you prefer taking the tram, the stop is 2 minutes from the hotel, and the tram will also take you directly to Dolmabaci Palace (30 min). Hotel rooms are super-clean and tastefully furnished though they could be better isolated. Try to get a room away from the cleaners' broom board, cleaning starts after 8. The hotel also has a very small swimming pool, sauna, and fitness room, all very clean. Breakfast is fantastic even though it does not change much. As long as you do not spend weeks in the hotel, you will enjoy. The main asset of the Sirkeci Konak is its staff, virtually everybody is most polite and friendly. The guest ifeels like a king, and this has become rare nowadays. Thanks to all staff. Advice: even Ms Petek could not find all the Bergama connections. I managed in the end, and you might find the following to be helpful. Do not pay a lot of money to take a flight to Izmir and a bus from there to Bergama. Avoid the sticky night buses that need hours and hours to just go around the Marmora Sea. Go to the Instanbul Gar (railway station) and ask at the counter (not the rather unfriendly tourist office) for a combined ferry-train ticket to Bergama. It is very cheap, but booking in advance may be useful. On the day of departure take a taxi from the hotel to the ferry port, cross the Marmora Sea with the early-morning speed boat (ca. 7 am). When you arrive in Bandirma, at the other side of the Marmora Sea, the train is waiting for you, 5 minutes from the ferry port. This train goes from Bandirma to Basmane (Izmir) at 9.45. However, you leave in Soma where it arrives at 12.45 (all times September 2007). The train will only stop for 2 minutes, so make sure you do not fall asleep. There are taxis and the cheap minibuses from Soma Gar (outside the small town) to Soma Otogar (bus terminal in the centre). From there you can take several buses to Bergama. You arrive after 3 and will have sufficient time to take a motorcycle or taxi ride to the top of the Bergama hill and visit the excavations. On the way back, take the footpath behind the Zeus temple and walk down through the ruins of the old city. Look for cheap accomodation in Bergama? Try the Athena Guesthouse. There are no proper hotels in Bergama. If this is what you want, then indeed fly to Izmir and take a day trip by bus.", "Date": "May 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "DrSD", "ReviewID": "UR15590143", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Sirkeci Konak Hotel from April 26-May 1.

Although we knew from the earlier reviews that one person had a birthday celebrated we weren't sure whether that had been a 'one-off' so were delighted when a cake and candles were brought out at the 5pm tea slot on the appropriate day, swiftly followed by a present each. A 50th birthday was also being celebrated by a newly arrived family so a second cake was presented! I was offered a dairy-free alternative to the cake when I mentioned my inability to tolerate milk: a delicious apricot and almond dessert. Breakfasts were excellent: I am often very restricted with what I can have, but with both fresh and stewed fruit and a range of hot dishes I was given plenty of choice (the waiters were very knowledgeable about the ingredients of dishes). We had one evening meal at the restaurant which was delicious. The bar area lacks the atmosphere of some of the sister hotels in the chain which we visited, but the floor area is quite small so it is hard to see what else could be done. The beds are quite hard (so often the case - we now carry a single bed foam topper which we spread across the middle of the bed).

The room we were given was quiet, as we had requested, clean and room service was prompt as well as friendly. Lovely. All throughout our stay the lovely Customer Relations Manager, Menekse helped us out with suggestions for places to visit and even joined us for some congenial chat over breakfast- we felt very welcomed and certainly the Sirkeci is an ideal location from which we could travel to all the important Tourist sites. We also enjoyed chatting to all the staff after a day out , sometimes recanting the adventures we had had in the city, with them. I personally, being a languages enthusiast, took every opportunity to practice a few lines of Turkish that I had learned much to the amusement and pleasure of all the staff. :-) We would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to ALL types of travellers, especially if you wish to sample a taste of REAL Turkish hospitality as opposed to Western-orientated 'tourist' hotels where you have all the mod-cons without the heart and soul! Also, if you appreciate Oriental Art you will not be disappointed with this beautiful, compact Ottoman designed hotel; the hotel lounge is a lovely place to sit back and chat with your fellow-travellers whilst sipping some relaxing Turkish Tea after a day sight-seeing as we both did; and finally: if you desire a peaceful and quiet atmosphere to retreat to after a long day shopping and sight-seeing.. then the Sirkeci will not disappoint.

I had a few queries about things to do in Istanbul and emailed them before I arrived to which I received speedy responses. Upon arrival, they greet you with apple tea and provide an orientation of the city. They ask you right away if you need help booking any activities or restaurants. I think it is great that you are so proactive in helping their guests rather than waiting for you to come to them with your needs. You were always greeted with a smile from everyone who worked there. The location of the hotel is also very good. All the sights of the old town are within walking distance. The tram station is also right outside the hotel so you can catch that if you do not wish to walk somewhere. There are many places to eat right around the corner and also a grocery store nearby if you want to self cater. The daily breakfast is not exceptional but was adequate for us as our first fuel of the day. In contrast, the free welcome dinner in the hotel restaurant was truly excellent and not that far off in quality from the meal we had at Tugra, which is one of Istanbul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most expensive restaurants. We really enjoyed the dinner and were pleasantly surprised by its quality. Our only complaint is that it was difficult to book appointments with the spa upon arrival. I would suggest that you book your treatments ahead of time to avoid disappointment. I tried a few times during my stay to book a massage but was never able to secure an appointment. I have no reservations in recommending this hotel to anyone who is visiting Istanbul. We were very comfortable here and liked the small, homey feel of the hotel.", "Date": "April 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cSirkeci Amazing Despite 2 feet of snow!\u201d", "Author": "Baglady_NJ", "ReviewID": "UR14582969", "Content": "We arrived in Turkey for six nights at the Sireki Konak ,as snow began to fall.

The hotel is located on the tram line that connects the city and all the historic sites and best of all the Grand Bazaar, which is covered. Perfect for a day filled with snow. When we got back, we took a cooking lesson with the chef and made our own dinner. Since the chef speaks no english we had a wonderful translator named Engin who is the restaurant manger. He was so nice. We invited him to join us for dinner and afterwards he taught us how to play backgammon. So much fun! I must mention the food which was wonderful. The breakfast included local foods such as honey (on a real comb), olives, figs as well as standard breakfast fare. The egg dishes were particularily good. Out of six nights, we chose to eat at the hotel not only because of the cold and snow but mainly due to the delicoius food and wounderful staff. They are opening a fish resturant soon that will share the hotels kichen so I anticipate it will be wonderful. There is also an outdoor area that looks lovely in the pictures.

I just got back last night from Istanbul where myself and my friends - total 6pp/3 rooms all stayed at this hotel and we were thrilled with the hotel- We could not have been happier! First off this hotel is not trying to be a Ritz Carlton or a Four Seasons as some past reviewers tried to compare it to so I will not be comparing it to any other hotel. PRE ARRIVAL: A few weeks prior to our arrival I received kind emails from the hotel offering any pre-assistance in advance for any reservations, restaurants, tours etc. I enjoyed this and it made me even more excited for the trip! It was as though these emails were a countdown to my trip! Thanks! LOCATION: The hotel is in the Sultamet area which was perfect for our needs. We were within walking distance to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Grand Bazaar, Spice Market, Ferry Boats, the Camerberlitas Hamam which is the Turkish bath we wanted to try, Toppikai Palace and many restauanats, stores etc. In front of the hotel there is a small store that sells sodas, water etc It is true that some of the stores in front of the hotel are rather odd like a filter store, metal scrap part store but who cares! Our entrance was charming! HOTEL OVERVIEW: First off- let me say that I booked our rooms direct with the hotel and I personally feel we got a great deal! 170 Euro per room per night included: Breakfast each day which was more than fine.. they had breads, eggs, dips, cheeses and all the traditional Turkish things. Welcome dinner per room (appetizer, main and dessert or main menu) Free airport transfers RT Cooking Lesson- We were all offered a free cooking class with the chef which was great fun and we learned a traditional recipe, not to mention that it actually became our dinner- so really we got two free dinners! CASH PAYMENT offered us a 7% Discount We were in Room 2204 and we had a cute balcony, CLEAN room, with mini bar and safe, air climate control system- which allowed me to make the room super chilly at night just the way I like, bathrobes, slippers, blow dryer, close up mirror, and desk. The bed was a queen size bed- which was yes made up of two beds pushed together but we barely felt the crack and it was fine. The sheets and towels in the room have a wonderful smell which I think is the OLIVE OIL SOAP that is sold all over the city... very fresh! The room had beautiful hard wood floors and a traditional Turkish decor. The bathroom was a beauitful tiled bathroom with a large sink and yes, with a tub and the typical European 1/2 panel glass. The previous reviewer commented on this and while I admit I am not a fan of these either- they are all OVER EUROPE, Paris, London, Berlin, Vienna so.... I think you just gotta get used to it. Ohh... the water pressure was amazing! The lobby isin't huge but is nicely decorated and offered just what we needed. We loved sitting in the lounge part after a long day on the town and having a traditional apple tea (Complimentary) The fitness Center, Pool and hamam and sauna down below are all great- we loved the pool and hamam. COOKING CLASS AT HOTEL: Included in our room rate was a cooking class with the chef. Don't miss it ! We got to dress up as Chefs, hats and glovers and away we went! Just another treat from the hotel. STAFF: As many have commented before- the hotel staff at at this hotel is wonderful. They truly go out of their way to assist with anything they can and make it a point to make you feel at home. The nice part of staying at a hotel this size is that you see the same hotel staff each day vs. different. ISTANBUL IN GENERAL: I loved this city quite a bit and having seen many places in the world this was my 1st. Muslim city and I was fascinated by all. I think it''s fair to say that the city is HUGE and there is a lot to see! We covered all the main sites and really enjoyed the charm, yet also the reality of the city and some of the impoverished parts. In terms of dining on two of our nights we went to two amazing places of which this first one is in my top 10 EVER Dining Experiences: 1. AL JAMAL- This is a swanky, trendy place that serves an all you can eat Turkish dinner with wine & beer included and a wonderful belly dancing show for a set price! We were only able to get reservations via a Turkish friend of mine since when each time I called they were sold out. In fact the place was sold out and the people there were primarily wealthly beautiful Turkish people. The cool part is that since they only have one seating we actually met some of the people close to our table. The atmoshere was graet, the food was amazing, the service was perfect and very attentive and yes- the belly dancers were HOT! Our reservation was at 8:30pm and we left the place at 2am! Everyone was dancing, and having a blast and our wine/beer glasses were still always being filled. The cost was $150USD per person- which for 5.5 hours of great food, wine, service, belly dancers and dancing with amazing DJ music- I think it was well worth it! 2. The 2nd. place we went to was the famous RAINA. This too is a hot trendy , swanky place with more Continental Food. The menu was wonderful, the food was great, the views were amazing and the decor was ultra sexy, red and just HOT. Yet the service was a tad so so. This place became an exclusive club after dinner and here too- the place filled with wealthy Turkish crowds all looking to dance the night away! I hope this helped you a little and if you have any questions let me know!

They are absolutely fantastic and make the service at this hotel more than 5 star. Right from the moment we booked I felt cared for by the staff personally. I brought my girlfriend to Istanbul for a special occasion and the lengths the staff went to to help was astonishing. They responded to my many requests promptly and made me feel welcome before we even arrived. Once in Istanbul I felt that every member of staff was personally looking out for us and focused entirely on making the stay one of our best ever trips and they succeeded and beyond. The staff arranged for us to upgrade for the final evening to a wonderful deluxe room. More than that, they arranged for flowers, rose petals, a CD player and more for the room, and managed to help me keep it all a secret so it would be a surprise for my girlfriend. They recommended a restaurant that had the most specatacular views over Istanbul and the food was superb.

There is a complimentary morning buffet full of Turkey's bountiful offerings, including an assortment of cheeses, cold cuts, preserves, pastries, quiche and fruits...far more delectable than your traditional continental breakfast. And during afternoon tea, the owner of the Sirkeci hotels visits with each guest personally. He shares with you his philosophy that each visitor to Istanbul is a student...of culture, of history, of life. There is a full library of books available to supplement your journey, and I truly enjoyed sipping my apple tea flipping through the glossy pages of a book on Turkish architecture. Finally, nothing makes a travel experience more enriching than meeting wonderful people. The staff at the Konak are beyond friendly. They always greet you with a smile and attend to your every need without hesitation. Menekse, the Guest Relations Manager deserves special mention. She was indispensable and truly became a part of our family. I can honestly say that the Konak was one of the most enjoyable and memorable parts of my trip.", "Date": "December 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLack of clothing space\u201d", "Author": "thumbelina2", "ReviewID": "UR11380239", "Content": "I was looking forward to staying at the hotel due to the other TA reviews. From my research it looked as though the Sirkeci would provide a superior stay to other hotels in the Sultanhamet area. STANDARD ROOMS The rooms are certainly newly done up but the standard rooms are very small. Approx 1 ft on one side of the bed, 1/2 ft at the end and about 3 ft the other side. For a couple it would feel very cramped. There was a small shelf on which one could fit one suitcase which halved the size of the corridor to the bathroom and a tiny cupboard with some hanging space and a safe. The only shelf was well over six ft high so not much help and apart from two small bedside tables there were no other drawers for clothing which wasn't helpful. The bed was comfortable with nice linen and synthetic pillows (other types were available on request) and a synthetic duvet. There was a small desk/vanity unit with a mirror and power socket and stool and a small chair and table and a mini bar. The bathroom was well appointed with a small marble surround for the sink and a glass screen on the bath so you could also use it as a shower. The flat screen tv had the Halmark film channel, BBC Prime and Al Jazeera (news) as the English language channels. The complimentary turkish delight was a nice touch but I was surprised to find out that the two small complimentary water bottles were for the entire duration of my six day stay!! Not particularly helpful when the tap water isnt safe to drink. Although the sheets were changed daily I noticed that bits of mud on the floor stayed throughout my stay! BREAKFAST The breakfast wasnt as extensive as I had been led to expect from the reviews. It was rather poor in comparison to other places I have stayed in. Slightly stale pastries, cereals with UHT milk, olives, yogourt, cheese and meats. I was longing for freshly cooked to order fried eggs. The only cooked breakfast was scrambled eggs with vegetables mixed in. LOCATION The hotel is down a rather decrepid side street but it is nice and quiet and only about 30 secs walk from the Gulhane tram stop. It's about 15 mins walk from the Grand Bazaar and 10 mins uphill to the Hagia Sofia and Topkapi Palace. The view from the bedroom was disappointing - straight out onto the back of another building. QUIET Fortunately the double glazing in the hotel works well and the call to prayer never woke me up although once during the day, when i had the window open, the noise was mind blowing! STAFF The staff were extraordinary welcoming and helpful. The check-in was very pleasant with a glass of apple tea and suggestions on what to see. As others have said, they treat you like family which is a nice change from other larger more impersonal hotels. Having said that, I had to wait for a week to get confirmation by e-mail that they had received my reservation. And trying to obtain confirmation that I could have a room with a bathtub instead of just a shower was a nightmare involving numerous emails, faxes and telephone calls. There is free internet in the lobby too which was helpful.", "Date": "December 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Hotel in Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "FriscoTripper", "ReviewID": "UR11214685", "Content": "Having heard of and read various horror stories of foreign travelers being hustled and mistreated in Turkey, I had my fair share of hesitation and anxiety upon my arrival in Istanbul for the first time. This wasn't helped by the fact that the customs agent who processed my visa at the airport reached behind her chair and put the money I gave her for my visa into her own purse and cheated me on my change. Oh great, I thought. I haven't even left the airport yet, and I've already been ripped off. How comforting it was then to emerge into the arrivals hall and see my name on a placard and a friendly smile greeting me. \"Mr King? Welcome to Istanbul. I am from the Sirkeci Konak Hotel. Your car is waiting for you. Please allow me to help you with your bags.\" Reaching the old town and seeing the ancient city walls, the towering mosques and blue waters of the bosphorus I began to get excited. Maybe I got off to a rough start, I thought to myself. But let's hope the hotel makes up for it. Boy did it! All my cares and concerns melted away upon reaching the hotel where the staff practically fell over themselves introducing themselves and welcoming me. The hotel manager, the guest services manager, the restaurant manager, the bellman, the front desk clerk --- all made a point of coming over to me and introducing themselves, making it very clear that they were here to help make my stay comfortable and personal. Disney should send people here to learn customer care. The hotel is great. It is an old building that has been completely transformed with all the modern amenities you'd desire, plus a few extras, especially the hamam (turkish bath and pool) downstairs where I had an amazing massage. All the jet lag started to melt away... Since I booked my stay directly trough their website, they treated me to a fabulous 4-course dinner on the house. I live in San Francisco, arguably one of the world's greatest food towns, but I am telling you the cuisine of the hotel's restaurant was unreal. The meal was so good I never ate dinner anywhere else during my entire stay in Istanbul. The rooms can seem a little small at first, but they are lovely with first rate baths and turkish touches like a brass dish full of turkish delights (little nut-flavored gum drops covered in powdered sugar that are totally addictive!). The bed is every bit as comfy as a Westin Heavenly bed and the brass lamps and chandeliers combined with the muted color scheme really give you a cozy, \"wow I am really in Turkey\" feeling. Extra touches include a big turkish breakfast buffet with exotic cheeses, yogurts and fruits, egg dishes and a plethora of baked goods plus afternoon tea. The hotel is located in a transitional area overlooking the palace walls, a stone's throw away from the tram and within easy walking distance of the citiy's principle sights. You can't go wrong with this place. I didn't want to leave. And I credit the hotel, and principally the staff, for making me fall in love with Istanbul. The only thing I would have liked to have would be internet in the rooms, but they did have WiFi in the lobby.

However, it's the personal service, fine attention to detail, and a mantra to make their guests feel at home that sets them apart from other hotels. When I had tea at the hotel (which occurs daily, for free!), the owner approached two of his guests and introduced himself. Not only did he try to get to know them, but when he learned of their itinerary, he got out maps and other materials to help them plan their time in Istanbul. It's a little sad to say that I am unaware of hotel owners who have that kind of initiative, interest, or pay that kind of attention to their guests.

Sailing the Turkish coast from Bodrum to Kemer and in this year to Cypress and back to Antalya I felt tempted to visit the approx. 3000 year old city Istambul something we had planned for years. This year we made it happen and my wife flew into Istambul from Germany to meet me for some 10 days \u00c2\u00b4stay in this fantastic historical place - once East Rome, then Byzantion, and finally since 1453 the Islamic Centre - one of the trade hubs of the world- a treasure of culture. The first contact after managing the transfer from the airport was the Konak Hotel where we were welcomed very cordially and extremely well serviced: All persons of the staff did a wonderful job to make us feel at home. In particular the guest relations manager Menekse Goker - a young lady talented to combine her oriental charme with an english style education gave us ample information and insight in the city and its historical and other important places. Given this chance we collected a multitude of experiences and dare say we got more than a first sight impression. We found it extremely nice and thoughtful of Miss Goker to present us with a cooking book of \"Turkish Cuisine\" since we showed interest in different meals of the local type - as we always do when abroad. Also- the top manager - Mr. Faruk - spared much time to indoctrinate us in so many interesting things of Istambul life. We appreciated the many talks we had together. And we followed the advices given to see museums, to do special tours etc. Not to mention that the hotel is excellent, the room, the facilities incl. a turkish bath .... and all persons of the hotel we learned to like very much. So this our first visit to Istambul was a real highlight -much of the glory goes to the hotel and we like express our gratitude. Thank you all! The next years we plan to come to Istambul with all our 3 daughters provided they accept our invitation and have no other plan. And then it is 100 % clear that we book your hotel again.

This involved a trip to the yarn district near the Spice Bazaar and then when they didn't have what I wanted, she spoke to the yarn vendors and off we on a tram to the industrial part of Istanbul.

But what makes your stay extremely special is that they have the best guest relations manager ever! Meneske, the guest relations manager, and Petek (the previous Guest Relations Manager) made me feel like I was family, instead of a guest. I had numerous questions and requests prior to arrival, and I got thorough detailed responses to each and every one of them in a prompt manner. Then when I arrived at the hotel, Meneske went out of her way to show me Istanbul \"off the beaten path\" - and I had a blast! Everyone else at the hotel was also committed to ensuring both myself and my mom were comfortable and taken care of. We had the hotel arrange dinner reservations and their recommendations were always fantastic. Lastly, they also offer a breakfast spread that is unmatched anywhere else, as well as tea and snacks around 4/430!
