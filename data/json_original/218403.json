And I would stay here again. The pros: 1. Price. 80 quid for a double room with free internet. For the location and hotel standard, the price can't be beat. 2. Owners: warm, hospitable North Indian/Punjabis. Attentive, caring, eager to please. 3. Location: Inverness Terrace is the street next to Queensway, and the hotel is right opposite Hyde Park. Central as central can be, and excellent public transport connections. 4. Rooms: Modern, clean, well-appointed with good daily room service. 5. Building: historic property with grand front lobby/entrance, lovingly maintained and restored (dark woods, old English portraits of royalty, mahogany leather couches, etc) The cons: 1. Hands down, the Eastern European front desk staff. Young, inexperienced, wooden. Not even able to smile back when smiled at. Automaton-like. Barely able to cooperate or service guest requests. Had to be pleaded with, and thanked profusely later - even that didn't bring forth a smile! 2. Rooms are small. Not only in terms of general area to walk around in, but also with very low ceilings. Since the building is a Victorian conversion, one assumes the floors were divided into two. Not for the claustrophobic, as upper floor windows do not even open. Thankfully, the ground floor has some windows that do. 3. Internet is free, but wired. Small inconvenience. However, I must add that I ended up getting a room on the ground floor (#034) which had wireless access. It should be added that emails to management prior to my stay were answered promptly and professionally, and I even received a call at my overseas number to ensure my queries were answered. I was quite grateful for this gesture. Also, I ended up having severe toothache the first night of my stay. The front desk staff responded caringly and amazingly. A young man named Ravi, who deserves special mention, sprinted out around midnight to the nearest pharmacy and brought back painkillers at barely a moment's notice. For this, I couldn't thank him enough. Overall, this was a great experience with initial hiccups during checking. I would definitely stay in this hotel again, and recommend it with the only caveat that front desk staff who check guests in be as warm and cooperative as the night-time staff on call at the front desk.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cVery nice little hotel\u201d", "Author": "Bea_7", "ReviewID": "UR126219322", "Content": "We stayed three nights in a deluxe double room.

Only booked a few days before the trip direct on the hotels website but when we arrived we were told that there was a problem in some of the rooms with damp and we were being transferred to their sister hotel down the road, the Shaftesbury Grand Royale. When we arrived at the sister hotel we were told that, due to the inconveience we would be given complimentary breakfasts but I actually had already paid for them so this was not the case. This hotel doesn't have some of the things listed at the originally booked hotel, restaurant, gym, room service, iron, ironing board etc and has a poorer trip advisor rating. Not sure if this is a scam or not on the hotels part but felt a bit let down after booking one thing and actually ending up with something else. The hotel itself if seeped in history and the staff were friendly, the breakfast was great but the room we had was so small it crazy. Very difficult to get ready, showered, dressed etc and the bed is smaller than a double. You have to sit on the toilet sideways as there isn't enough room to sit on properly. The view we had from our window was at the back of the hotel and not very nice and the window only stayed open by being jammed with a towel. The hotel is very clean though. We did talk to another couple on our last night who were not happy about the size of their room and demanded something else, they were given the bridal suite which was about 8 times the size of our room and that bathroom was out of this world.

I booked a \"Deluxe\" double, which was meant to be more spacious than a \"superior\" double. It was in fact the smallest hotel room I have ever seen. You cannot tell from the pictures on the site, but there is hardly any space around the bed. When I complained that this could not be a \"deluxe\" room, they said that in fact I had been upgraded to a \"club\" room that was even larger! Indeed as I saw in the fire escape plan behind the door, my room seemed to be among the largest. I sincerely fail to see how smaller rooms could fit beds in them (let alone luxuries such as space for your luggage!). Similarly, the bathroom was really tiny. You could only be in the shower or on the loo (sideways), no other space. So my first impression was very negative, as I feel that the representation of the rooms is not done in good faith.

We stayed for two nights back in July 2011 and I must admit chose the hotel for location and price but was really worried after reading all the negative comments on trip advisor. I emailed Paulo Goncalves obtaining his email address from this site and advised we were thinking of staying but were worried about some of concerns expressed by other travellers and could he ensure a quiet room and that we would not be moved. He replied that same day which was impressive and he also stated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will be glad to fulfil your request of a nice room in a quite area of the Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also assured us we would not be moved. We were due to stay five nights but had to depart to the next leg of our journey earlier than expected and now know we would have been most comfortable for the full five days which is great to know for future reference. The location and huge area adjacent to check in where there are ample complimentary papers is really nice, big leather couches and has a nice historical feel. We did not eat at the hotel and think that perhaps the room at the back where you can have afternoon drinks should be opened up to adjoin the huge area adjacent to the check (where the papers and computers are) as this room is just beautiful and has so much potential. I would love to have been able to have order a coffee to have here whilst I was reading the paper in this room. The location really is a highlight and two days was definitely not long enough. One day we hope to be back over the other side of the world and would definitely stay at this hotel again. Thank you. The staff were friendly and our room was great it was a good enough size, nice and bright and airy and was on the 6th floor, room 605.

Sure there are hot English breakfast options, charcuterie, cheese, fruits and yoghurt but I would be more interested if you have the option to ask for omelette, other cooked eggs... Perks: lots of shops nearby for food, groceries and you have Whiteleys shopping centre for nice restaurants and the cinema, free wifi and the airport shuttle pickup from hotel was great if you don't want to drag all that weekend shopping through the London Tube or Heathrow Express! Shuttle picked up other passengers in other hotels but that didn't matter.

The bedrooms are modern and well presented and the bedroom that we stayed in was a deluxe bedroom.

The hotel is in a fabulous location literally a few steps into Hyde Park and to the main Bayswater shops and restaurants. Transport links are also good just at the bottom of the road are bus stops and tube stations. The hotel communal areas and receptions are stunning with lovely wooden panelling. We especailly enjoyed the smell of fresh lilleys. It was so nice to stay somewhere which has real character. Our room (503) was exceptionally clean and modern with a good sized flat screen TV & a really comfortable bed. The bathroom was very small but very modern and it had everything needed. Another nice touch was there is a small fridge under the desk and the individual room climate was excellent so it never felt too hot or cold. Breakfast was a fair choice considering it was included in the price and the breakfast rooms themselves are beautifully ornate. A really nice environment to start the day. The best thing about the hotel was the way they have kept all the original features and character away from the modern refurbished bedrooms, you just enter them from the lovely sweeping staircase. There have been many bad reviews about the staff but from the moment we arrived Gagan and his staff were first class with their customer service. The breakfast staff were particularly nice. Ok so there has to be a few negatives to make this a balanced review, well there are but literally a few. The fan in our room didnt work and the maintenance call out was slow, but when they couldnt fix it we were offered another room. As it is a listed building the original windows do let quite a draught in but the room climate is so effective it is easily dealt with. One of the porters let the staff down as they really werent that interested in their job and it showed.

The bed was comfy and seemed wider than a standard single and the bathroom new and clean. My only complaint about the room was the noise, I can sleep through a rock concert but this place is opposite a hostel and there were people hanging around and making a lot of noise until 12pm when it seemed to settle down. The rooms also had like a bay window and being an old building this did let in a lot of cold air! The building is really beautiful though. Room was serviced adequately each day. The staff were just there, they were not pleasant or rude, I was aware they might try to shaft me off to another hotel so I emailed them before I arrived stating that if that was their intention they needed to let me know as I didn't have time to be stuffed about, no reply from them but I didn't get shafted like many seem to have been. Many of the staff seemed to struggle with English and the reception area always seemed to have too few staff, you always had to wait to speak with them and often they weren't very well informed. Their front line could certainly use some work. The location is great, 3 minutes to Queensway tube and almost across the road from Kensington Gardens where I picked up a blue bike and rode to Hyde Park and beyond. Notting Hill markets about a 10 - 15 minute walk away. A bus also runs along the main road straight to Oxford St and you are also 5 minutes in a cab to Paddington station to catch the Heathrow Express.

I was not impressed with the area at all. I had made reservations three months in advance as I was traveling from the States. When I arrived I was given a room in the lower ground, this is the translation for \"basement\". It is like a labyrinth, my room was all the way at the end of a very narrow hall, it is so narrow, that my small luggage could barely fit through; I had problems trying to open the door of the bedroom and turning my small luggage. The room was very small although it looked like if it was updated; the bedroom window was unlocked....and that terrified me, since it is wide and from the floor to almost halfway to the ceiling. The hallway rug was old and very tired. I decided to change into something more comfortable and go out to get something to eat, and while I was in my under wears, a man opened the door of my room and tried to get in!! I was terrified and screamed...he said in a very broken English, \"I'm sorry\"; he looked Russian to me with a very heavy accent. I got dressed right away and went out as fast as I could. I took my notebook computer and valuable items with me, just in case it would be stolen. I went to the Reception in the Lobby, with every intention of reporting the incident, but decided not to, afraid of some type of retaliation. As as I was approaching the elevator I saw the same guy again, and he told me \"I'm sorry\" again, apparently he is part of the staff and was going around changing the shower curtains, you would think that he would knock on the door before he got in with his master key...unbelievable!!!, I went out and walked around for a few blocks, and the area is full of very shady characters, just did not feel safe at all. As if this was not enough, there is Hostel across the street from the hotel, and in the side walk in front of hostel, there were a group of young people screaming and making all kinds of noises, as loud as they could be. I went back to the hotel and sat in the Lobby until around 7:00 pm and then went back to my room; I was really scared; I decided to put my luggage against the door and sat on the bed to watch TV until around 4:00 am, drinking tea, afraid of falling sleep, when I decided to check out. I had a driver schedule to pick me up at 5:00 am to take me to the airport and I preferred to wait in the Lobby for him...I have never felt so scared in my whole live; I am not a young person anymore, I have travel a bit in my life and I don't get scare easily, but this was a frightening experience. While I was sitting in the lobby at that time of the early morning, I could still hear the young people from the hostel screaming and horsing around like if they were drunks.... I can't believe that I paid $225 for me to have to go through this horrible experience. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone, for this price, you should be able to at least feel safe and be able to get some rest. The Victorian charm other people have written about is very old and tired, although, when photographed looks very luxurious. I have stayed in less expensive hotels in London, better priced and in better locations, were you can feel safe and the people look like normal people.

So he organized the taxi and without telling us where he's sending us put us in a car where driver tried to convince us we're going to a nice hotel next to Marble Arch. I asked the driver for the address of the hotel and it turned out hotel was on completely other side of the city, nowhere near Marble Arch. When we called the reception at the Grand Royale and asked them how's this near Marble Arch, he said it's near, it's 15 min by cab. I complained to the manager at the other hotel as I wasn't interested to stay at their hotel. He organized us a transfer back at the Grand with an upgraded room and breakfast. By this stage we already lost 4 hours of our night. Next morning, upon our arrival at Grand, as soon as the guy from the previous night saw us, he ran and hid. Very mature for 5 star hotel. We checked in and our room was not upgraded, but quite the opposite - downgraded. When we were to go to bed, we discovered a lot of dirty tissues under the bed cover as well as dirty bed linen. And the last drop was the transportation to the station was organized by hotel and as the mAnager assured me it was going to be free due to all the inconvenience, the driver asked me to pay.

Their management and service approach is better suited to a Youth Hostel. On the hotel website, they ask for estimated arrival time (\"Please let us know your arrival and departure flight details so that we can better prepare for your room arrangements\"). However, the 2 Romanians clerks (male and female) working at the Front Desk when I arrived made it clear that they were not interested in any preparation of room arrangements. They said no access to the rooms would be granted before 14:00. (If this is the approach, then please remove this question from the on-line reservation process because it creates unrealistic expectations and only results in frustration.) At 13:40 when returning to hotel, I asked about if they could assign me a room. The Front Desk clerk (the Romanian man) replied that it was impossible because the computer system would only be refreshed at 14:00 and he could not see which had be cleaned already. When I then asked kindly contact housekeeping, he said that this was also not possible. This is not the kind of response one should expect from a 4 star London hotel but obviously this was the best they could do.

We were told that they didn't have a room for us and would have to go elsewhere. I immediately demanded the manager and was furiously complaining. It would appear that it paid off after literally shouting, screaming and quoting Trip Advisor reviews to the manager and the staff. The many staff around simply held their heads down, you could tell this was commonpractice and happens often. But not to me. I refused to be treated like this and after the manager telling me to calm down, he headed to the computer and tapped about on it, eventually telling us that he HAD got a room on the 4th floor and that it was one of their club suites. We demanded to see the room before we paid and found a MASSIVE suite with 4 poster and huge bathroom with double sinks, wet room shower and standalone bath. It was beautiful. We had paid \u00c2\u00a3150 for our booking. We later found out the room was over \u00c2\u00a3400 that we stayed in. It pays to complain it would seem. I must admit, as I was ready for any double booking news, I was on the defensive and was ready to complain. I told the hotel manager (who was actually very nice) that I would not be treated like this and that the whole scam needs to stop! You cannot treat people like this, we had travelled 200 miles for this and whilst we were in reception, other guests heard me shouting and clearly some were also being transferred to a different hotel also. It was surreal to be in this very situation. I am so disgusted by this whole scam that I am complaining to Shaftesbury Hotels and will also be taking this to watchdog to see if we can get some TV coverage about this as it HAS TO STOP. There are people who will be staying at this hotel, oblivious to the scam and simply accept the transfer to another hotel without questioning. Also, on reading reviews, it would seem others who have complained have still been transferred. I was obviously raging enough for them to keep us quiet. Hence getting a \u00c2\u00a3450 room for \u00c2\u00a3150. My advice to people wanting to stay here is simple: THERE IS NO GUARANTEE that you will have a room here, if you've booked then be prepared to be told by some miserable Polish staff member that 'they have bad news'. What you do beyond there is up to you but if you complain hard enough, they will let you stay, but who would want to stay after that?! It ruined on our trip knowing that we'd been in this situation. No one should be subjected to that and I intend on getting to the bottom of this scam and fully exposing it and putting a stop to it for the sake of others. As for the room, it was beautiful but the furniture was tired and the cleaners attention to detail in the bathroom was a bit poor on the sinks. Didn't eat the food as ate somewhere else, did not want any other contact with the staff to be honest. We had an amazing night's sleep, average view.

After an overnight flight from the US via Iceland, we were tired, hungry & thirsty so the last thing we felt like doing was sitting in their lounge room waiting for them to sort it out - which took about 30 minutes!

I did not accept the internet excuse being offered as I also work in the IT industry. I then asked why we were not notified before arrival but got no reply, the receptionist was well versed and used to dealing with annoyed guests in this practice and gave us the same line on cancelling our booking and looking for accommodation elsewhere as was offered to other guests, also we were not alone on that day as there were other guests experiencing the same issue with some accepting the excuses readily. I then contacted DHR/JacTravel and informed them of the issue and they contacted the hotel and basically were informed we had no other choice but to stay the first night in the other hotel and move back up in the morning, this room was supposed to be a club room but as you will see from the attached photo it had two single beds pushed together. We did this and left our bags and checked in on the 4th of June to be given a tiny room on the 6th floor with a broken window catch and no room to open the drawer on the table at the end of the bed - the room was too small for the bed and our luggage so we rejected this and was relocated to another room which was slightly bigger. On the 5th of June we were contacted by reception about payment for the final night of our trip by a nice mannered male receptionist and we went down to reception to again look to meet the manager but again no one was available so we gave a copy of our pre-paid booking to the desk and informed him to advise that we would be lodging a formal complaint to the hotel board in due course.

On arrival, the entrance to the hotel is very impressive which further hightens your expectations for a comfortable stay in a nice hotel room. However, the room we were given (room 102) was so small, I do not feel it was worth the rates charged at all. The smal shower room was directly inside the main door to the room with a a smal fights of steps leading to a room measuring approximately 9ft square. The room really only holds the bed with a few pieces of furniture shoe horned in. It was not possible to sit on the chair at the small dressing table as it hit against the foot of the bed. It was difficult to walk up one side of the bed without triping on or getting tangled up in the curtains! The bed was exceptionally hard so I did not sleep well at all. I stay in London hotels every week and this room is in no way usual in terms of price (expensive), size or level of comfort. Besides breakfast, the only food available in the hotel is sandwiches in the bar (seemingly only toasted cheese and ham on the evening we stayed). You can get reception to order a pizza. We went out for dinner and decided to go back to the hotel bar for a night cap. Unforunately, we could not have the Irish Coffee we ordered as the hotel does not keep fresh cream (4 star?). There is no parking available so we were directed to a local car park which ost \u00c2\u00a325 for 24 hours. Overall, we were very disappointed with this hotel and left feeling that we had not received value for money! I really could not recommend it to anyone.

There is very little in London that is appropriately or realistically priced, but I got a superior double room at the Grande Royale for less than \u00c2\u00a3100 per night which was very reasonable when compared to others.

Interestingly, rooms were also being shown as available on other booking sites. We were offered alternative accommodation at a sister hotel, Shaftesbury Premier London Notting Hill. We made our way to this hotel and fortunately requested to view the room first. This alternative room which was described as their club room, was located in the basement level and was not what we would consider an upgrade, or even comparable to what we had expected at the Grand Royale. I agree with a previous review that the practices of the Shaftesbury Hotels are dishonest, misleading and not consistent with fair trade practices.

The staff are very friendly but didn't seem to have any local knowledge and over heard them failing miserably to provide people with local information. The next problem is the bar it's tucked at the back in the historic theatre bit but it is not inviting, has no atmosphere and service is terrible. Eg sherry served in a wine glass and filled up! And champagne served in without any proper wine glasses. It would be much better to move the bar into the main sitting which has more atmosphere but no centre point. They could then serve tea, coffee and drinks all day and this would create this desired atmosphere. Finally in my moans is just the general finish isn't up to standard.

I hoped they had sacrificed corridor space to make the rooms larger. Wrong. They were just as cramped and very basic. The view wasn't much to go by either. Considering the room i booked was given the name of 'superior double room' it was quite disappointed. there was no more than a 3ft gap from the end of the bed to opposite wall. I investigated the en suite & found that i could wash my hands while sat on the loo, you had very little room to turn around or put any of your wash things. The sink also rotated, which was quite concerning. Oh & if you want your bedside lamps on in the evening, you have to have your en suite light on otherwise they wont work. I met a friend on the friday evening & hoped for a few drinks in the Hotels bar only to find they had no hand pulled beers, only bottles & spirits. 2 half pint bottles of beer cost \u00c2\u00a38.

On the day we were due to travel I was contacted by the Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park Hotel first by telephone then a confirmation e-mail advising me that they had unavoidable maintenance problems and had made alternative accomodation arrangements for myself and my daughter at the Grand Royale London Hyde Park Hotel. Although not entirely happy with this myself and my daughter duly arrived at the Grand Royale London Hyde Park Hotel just before midnight (I wrote on the booking form at the ' that we would be arriving late that evening) and when we went to the desk to check in we were informed that this hotel, the Grand Royale London Hyde Park Hotel, had a broken boiler and therefore there were no available rooms. I should also point out that at no time during that day any attempt was made to contact myself to advise me of this probem prior to us travelling to London, also the staff at the desk said it had been broken since around 10:30 am that morning and we did not leave our house until 7:15pm that evening. After being told at check in about the broken boiler the hotel staff were basically dismissing any protestations that they had to find ourselves alternative accomodation of a similar standard, it should also be noted that there were also around a dozen other people as well as ourselves in the same situation, having arrived at that hotel late in the evening, after lots of arguing the desk staff contacted there reservation people and we were again informed that no alternative accomodation could be sought, and that we could, if we wished cancel our booking and find our own alternative accomodation, thus taking the onus away from the hotel to find us alternative accomodation, everyone effected by this pointed out that this was not acceptable and the hotel should find alternative accomodation, after another lengthy period of the desk staff calling their reservation people they came back and said all they could offer us was a two star hotel in Harrow which is in North West London or a Hotel at Heathrow Airport, neither of these locations would have been practical as we needed to be in Central London for my daughters University interview at around nine thirty that morning. At this point I personally managed to source a twin room at a hotel in Earls Court, which although not all that practicle I decided to take it, as at this point it was now around one forty in the morning of the 13th of April and we were both very tired. I should also point out that hotel guests who obviously had rooms were turning up and going to there rooms, when I challenged the desk staff asking why can these people have access to their rooms when there is no functioning boiler, his answer was that the broken boiler only affects some of the rooms, being cynical I would suggest that they were overbooking hoping people would no-show and they could charge twice for one room. All this time the desk staff were Rude, dismissive of the plight people were in and basically treating everyone, whom they could not find alternative accomodation for as a hindrance to them.

When the cab arrived, the driver went ballastic at the receptionist, protesting that it was just up the road and that he wasn't going to waste his time negotiating the one way traffic system! It became evident that this was not a private hire, but the hotel's own default shuttle system, a fleet of which was parked outside waiting to transport unsuspecting punters to other Shaftsbury accommodation. Of course, this unrequited outburst on the part of this employee was embarrasing, to the extent that I opted to follow his advice and walk the 50 metres. Only a few hours prior to arrival, The Grande Royale was still taking internet bookings. It is no wonder then that it needs a shiny fleet of silver, people carriers.

The rooms are as small as the other reviewers claim, and they are not for the infirm, the obese, or the spoiled and cranky. But just last weekend I stayed in a huge hotel room with two (American) queen-sized beds--in Melbourne, Florida, where there is nothing to do but go to a mall or--six miles aways--a beach with a CVS drugstore and a Wendy's. Believe me, I'd rather be in my tiny room at the Grand Royale and experiencing London, both inside and out. True, the Grand Royale IS in a touristy neighborhood, and not the swankiest one either. Though there is a Hilton around the corner, there is also an ill-kept hostel across the street with peeling paint and loud international teens. But the comparison that struck me most came on a misty Sunday morning as I cross the street for a stroll through Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. Paintings for sale lined the park side of Bayswater Road, and a series of elegant townhouses graced the opposite side of the street. It reminded me of a similar scene along New York's Central Park--only instead of staying in an outrageously expensive room on Fifth Avenue, I was staying in a modestly-priced room in a building designed by royalty and used by royalty as a pied a terre. When I returned from my walk, I would once again be ensconced--as were Lillie Langtry and future King Edward VII--in a lobby with gleaming carved-wood walls and furniture, beautiful windows, huge paintings, a fireplace and welcoming, comfortable leather couches and chairs. I would walk up an imposing red-carpeted staircase with painting ceilings in the stairwell to enjoy my English breakfast buffet in an ornate gold and white room, waited on by an energetic, competent, attentive and cheerful staff. But, unlike Lily and Edward, I would also have access to the hotel's computer and internet service, two tube stations within easy walking distance, a bustling multicultural neighborhood with great cheap restaurants, and every modern amenity in my room--which I concede might have been considered small even for a servant of Lily and Edward. Still, it was equipped with comfortable beds and linens, a fridge, slippers and bathrobes, a split of wine with wine glasses, and a selection of fruits and beverages. True, you need to aim the shower carefully to avoid flooding the room, but oh what a heavenly bathtub--just perfect after long days of admittedly tourist pursuits. The point I'm trying to make with my Paul Bowles quote is that if you measure the success of your vacation merely by the size of your room, you will not be happy here. I don't know how four-star ratings are achieved, but Grand Royale rooms are definitely not ranked for their spaciousness. And just so you know, my so-called \"spacious club twin room\" was just a regular twin room with the two beds pushed together, no space in between. The club treatment was simply the wine, robes, etc. Breakfast was also included with the club rate, and that rate was at least $50 USD less per day than any other 4-star hotel I investigated--and I checked out dozens. Many of the others did not include breakfast or free internet, both of which were important to me, but most of all, no other hotel was so uniquely and authentically English in its history and enduring charm. Other reviewers liked the hotel but faulted the staff, but I thought they were great. The hotel seemed full to me, but it might be overbooked in summer, so perhaps the staff has less attention to spare during those months. During my visit, however, everyone who helped me was exceedingly prompt, competent, and gracious. I did have to ask for a couple of things--the \"club\" treatment was missing from the room when we first arrived, and a curtain had to be re-hung when I accidentally knocked it down while opening the room's window--but these things were taken care of within minutes. To understand my high ranking of this hotel, please understand that it has little to do with its size or pretentiousness--it has very little of those things--and much to do with its charm, location, and history.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA complete con, don't be fooled by cheap rates\u201d", "Author": "Little_robbie", "ReviewID": "UR102497095", "Content": "Unable to really review what looks a beautiful hotel in an excellent location.

It was also slightly amusing to see three bellboys all taking more interest in their mobile phones rather than asking if we need a hand with our luggage, but nevermind! The room was a little pokey but very clean. The bed was a little too on the orthopaedic side, with possibly the firmest pillows I've ever experienced but we improvised by rolling up the counterpane which seemed to help. The evening reception staff struggled with our request for a bottle of water so we gave up and had tap water, but I guess they saved us a few quid so mustn't grumble! The breakfast was of a good standard and the serving staff very attentive. I'd also advise folks to check the Tube replacement program as the aforementioned Tube services were being fixed during the weekend we stayed there, resulting in a good half hour walk from where they terminated.

When he arrived after a long journey at 10.30 pm, the receptionist says they cannot provide a room as there is a \"maintenance issue\" & that they could offer another room at one of their sister concerns nearby, \"Shaftesbury Premier Notting Hill\" & provide a taxi to take him there. There is clearly a difference in rates between rooms in Shaftesbury Premier Notting Hill (SPNH) & Grand Royale, with the latter being more expensive. I had personally looked up & compared the rates of all the hotels that very morning, including SPNH before confirming Grand Royale. While Grand Royale was \u00c2\u00a365 single room only, SPNH was \u00c2\u00a352 deluxe single room & breakfast included. We were not bothered about breakfast & only the quality of hotel & hence booked Grand Royale. When my husband mentioned this to me while waiting for the taxi,I googled it on the to confirm it. The receptionist denied it & said that both hotels belong to the same class & hence their official website will state the same rates for both. The receptionist said that they will not refund the difference between room rates, nor would they give a complete refund (when my husband said that he would prefer to get his \u00c2\u00a365 back & book the same room at SPNH online for \u00c2\u00a352,which was being shown available at that very minute). As it was a long & tiring day, my husband did not challenge it further.The room at SPNH turned out to be alright,but the point is we could have got it by paying \u00c2\u00a352 from the start anyways.

Unfortunately, the best rate there was on offer was over \u00c2\u00a3240, so we decided to stay here as it looked so great on their web site. We had booked a superior room with breakfast for \u00c2\u00a3175 and, on arrival, were delighted to learn that we were being up-graded to one of their premier Club Rooms. When we opened the door we were amazed at its \"rabbit hutch\" size. Everything looked nice, but oh so claustrophobic. The shower room was remarkable. You could not stand anywhere in the shower cubicle without the shower curtain hanging against your body (and I'm thin). The toilet pedestal was also very cleverly located in a tiny corner by the shower and with the wash-hand basin directly in front. Quite novel - going to the loo and washing your hands at the same time. In this quality (price) hotel, you also expect some decent soap, shower gel and shampoo, not something non-descript, bearing the hotel group's name. and 'Made in China' on the bottles. Bed softness/hardness is mostly a personal preference, but ours was hard, high up and with excruciatingly solid polyester-filled pillows. Why oh why can't hotels get right the fundamental reason for staying with them i.e. a good night's sleep, like being at home? Our Club room (#214) faced out over the back yard to the Westminster Council-operated car park. That was fun, with all the comings and goings. Finally, our room had ceiling to floor sloping windows, each with semi-opaque fabric concertina blinds (you know, the sort you put in conservatories to cut down the sun). Well they weren't much use at cutting out the external light, so our room remained well illuminated and contributed to our fairly sleepless night. Breakfast - absolutely nothing of real quality here - fruit juice, cereals, TINNED fruit salad, and for the cooked option - soggy bacon (I hate this and Americans won't tolerate non-crispy bacon), gristly sausage, a fried potato triangle, over-cooked baked beans and rubberised scrambled egg. The croissants were stale. Not quite the \"greasy spoon\" but far short of what should be be provided.

It was not fit to be described as a double room, the bed appeared to be approx 4ft wide (which really is only suitable for single people), the bed was hard and uncomfortable as were the pillows. Bathrobes were supplied without the sash to tie around, so pretty useless really. The bathroom was bijoux - and actually quite dangerous as the bath was quite high to climb into with only a small gap between the shower screen and the basin stand - which incidentally extended so near to the edge of the bath which resulted in injury getting in and out as it was impossible to do without knocking against the sharp corner of the basin stand. There were other minor issues but not worth mentioning in detail - attention to detail - repairs etc. Breakfast - well that was an experience! We arrived at 9.30am (breakfast was until 10.30 am) and numerous people arrived after us. There were no glasses for fruit juice - and after making a request it was 15 minutes before they arrived. A good selection of food was available, although limited quantities. There were hot plates for the cooked food, but no cold plates for cold food. When we asked for a plate that was cold, we were told that only 'cereal bowls' were cold, and the only plates they had were hot ones. We did not want cold ham, cheese or fruit on a hot plate or in a cereal bowl. We even had to ask for cups for our coffee, as once we had sat at the table the waitress went off and started laying other tables before finishing ours. Very badly Managed, no organisation and very little concern towards the guests requests. The Reception and Bar Staff were very polite and courteous,check in and check out was quick and efficient, although we noted we were not asked if we had enjoyed our stay, we wonder why! We have stayed in numerous hotels in various destinations and have found the most comfortable beds and decent size rooms with good service and breakfast facilities and for less money are in America and Canada. The UK Hotel Industry could learn a lot from them. We were very disappointed as it took the edge off what was otherwise a very enjoyable weekend.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kettering, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing and still no response from 'Customer Care'!!\u201d", "Author": "MNickerson", "ReviewID": "UR85035162", "Content": "We went to this hotel for my birthday, and have to say I'm glad we didn't need to stay in the hotel that much.

It is ideally located, near Hyde Park for sunrise strolls, easy to hop on a London Tour Bus, walking distance to a variety of restaurants and shops. The grandeur and history that still remains for hotel guests to admire what was once the place of residence of the reknown British actress, Lilly Langtry - a gift from Edward VII as a token of affection whilst their romance was all a whirl for 3 years (1877 to 1880) is an added bonus! What truly makes you as a guest most welcome is the hotel manager, Justin, and his wonderful staff. They exude warmth, sincerity and care in their professionalism and are very attentive to any request a hotel guest may have - that indeed is rare to find in London these days. Such hospitality made our time spent even more special and we sincerely thank them all for it. The hotel room is clean, comfortable and, if you appreciate the preservation of history, it is then a pleasure to see all efforts being made to retain the glorious craftmanship you will see around you. The beautiful staircase with wood relief carvings of dogs hunting for deer in the forest tells a story of its own if you allow your eyes to let you see for yourself. The paintings from the ceiling were brought back to it's glory once the black paint that horrendously used to cover them in the very early years took time to remove and achieved magnificiently. What now is the breakfast room also retains it beauty of yesteryear where ballroom dancing once took place on the very polished wooden floors we walked on and the trio of crystal chandeliers above our heads. The full English breakfast was superb and we recommend you book it to start your day right! It is important to bare in mind that this 150 year old building is a \"grand old lady\" still standing proud and, therefore, requires the continuation of conservation projects and that takes time and money which we've been informed \u00c2\u00a36 billion has been poured into in order to carry out the projects. So, yes, the rooms are small as most London hotel rooms are but these rooms are clean, air conditioned, tranquil and well maintained by the staff and we slept extremely well. If there is any problem, you can rest assure that Justin and other hotel staff will tend to solve it for you immediately and that says more to us about \"quality\" than anything else which is superb. We highly recommend staying at this hotel if you truly want a warm, friendly and attentive hotel staff to make you feel welcomed. They take pride in being of service to all hotel guests and it shows!

When we did get seen only one of the 2 rooms that I had booked were on the system so frantic telephone calls to the central reservation personnel ensued. A mistake was acknowledged and a basement room with no natural light was allocated to my travelling companion - who just happened to be my MD! The receptionist then insisted we pay for our room for the entire stay upon registration (we were told \"its company policy\") before we had even seen the rooms - now I know why. I opened the door as far as I could (it was prevented from opening further by the hand-rail) and started walking into the room sideways (with a suitcase in each hand) as I had to because of the resitriction. Unbeknown to me - as it wasn't mentioned at check-in - I was entering a room that immediately led to stairs going down into the room without any form of landing. I lost my footing and dropped one of my suitcases down the stairs as I grabbed the handrail to stop myself falling. When I got into the room it was tiny. I tried to hand my clothes up in the wardrobe and it was so short my clothers didn't hang properly. You couldn't work at the desk sitting on the stool as there was not enough room - I had to sit on the bed. You couldn't walk around the window side of the bed as there was not enough room between the bed and the radiator. Sleeping in the room was extremely difficuly - the air conditioning worked on 2 settings only very cold or off! I had to turn off the air conditioning and opened a window instead. This did improve the room temerature but the noise coming from across the street at the Youth Hostel and the residents watching TV outside on their verandas until 2.30am meant that it wasn't too quiet! In addition, the internet connection was very patchy only working for a couple of minutes before it dropped out which became very annoying. I arranged to meet my colleague in the \"bar\" for a drink after checking in. There was no beer or lager on \"tap\" - it was all in bottles with a very short paper menu showing what was available. A bottle of mixer sized Coca Cola (or it may have been Pepsi) at \u00c2\u00a32.50 was a rip off. When I asked about this the barman didn't understand English - in fact I cannot remember during my stay talking to one member of staff where English was their first language! The best part of the stay was the breakfast which was a very good \"help yourself\" style which had a very wide selection. As we had been made to pay for the stay at check-in there was not need to check out but I thought it was interesting to observe that as we waited for our taxi there were even more people at reception complaining about their room / air conditioning / shower.

Stay away!!!! It is more than obvious that the Shaftesbury hotel chain has established a strategy of overbookings. If they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have sufficient rooms and they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly care about some clients, they move them from one hotel to another, they allocate them here and there. Pure fraud! We had booked 2 double rooms for the Grand Royale London Hyde Park in June. After a quite long journey, we arrived at the hotel, hoping to have a quick shower and relax at our nice hotel before going out. Unfortunately the Shaftesbury hotel chain thought differently\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Upon our arrival we were informed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there was a problem with the airconditioning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and we had to be moved to another hotel. We were firm in not being willing to move to another hotel since this is the hotel and the area we have booked. We also said that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind about the airconditioning. After a while another lady came along at the reception and informed us that there is a safety issue due to the airconditioning problem and there was not other choice but to move at the other hotel in Paddington. She said that the other hotel is better than Grand Royale , it is arranged that we would have very nice rooms but we had to pay the rooms to her because if we paid at the Paddington hotel we would be charged more\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. She also said that the hotel is close to Lancaster Gate. When we said is that we should have been informed about this before at least by phone she said that the booking company does not give to the hotel client information. The only reason we had agreed into moving to the other hotel was that we were too exhausted to argue more about it and we wanted to end this and finally have our rooms. She then informed us that a taxi has been ordered for us and it will soon arrive. We went outside of the hotel and waited more than half an hour with our luggage but noone arrived. After several complaints she called the taxi company again to find out that the driver came and left and we had to wait another fifteen minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 As soon as the taxi took us to the other hotel we saw a place significantly inferior to the hotel we had booked and we were taken to two rooms that were nothing bigger than the size of the bed with no view at all (all we could see was an iron plateau right in front of our window). Of course, the closest station was Paddington and not Lancaster Gate. When we asked to be moved to bigger rooms they said that they could only do it the day after. Needless to say that we have lost almost all of our first day in London (we would stay only two) and that we were too exhausted to do anything after that. To summarise I would like to say that not only were we not treated well and did not take what we have booked but also we were deceived and lied to as if we were stupid! When a person books a hotel he wants to stay at this specific hotel, if he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind, we would book a cheaper one. What is most important is the lies that we have heard: -The airconditioning problem\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. Ok, if there was an airconditioning problem why were there clients in the hotel? We are talking about a central ventilation system and not separate units. -The fact that we would move to a better and more expensive hotel. The other hotel appeared to charge 105 pounds per day at the Shaftesbury website while the Grand Royale London Hyde Park was 129 for the same type of room! -The fact that the booking company did not give them our details so that they could inform us in advance. Another lie. We had made several other bookings for this same trip and all the hoteliers called us asking for details etc.. -The lie about the location which was by far Paddington and not Lancaster Gate although this is the less important\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 After we returned to Greece we sent a complaint letter asking for compensation and we received a reply, repeating the same lies and offering us a room at a discounted rate for a stay in the next 6 months (not stating the duration of stay nor of course the price). How generous of them! The company must derive from Scotland definitely\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. To conclude: Do not book the Grand Royale London Hyde Park!

The air conditioning in the room was very noisy but had no choice but to put it on as you were unable to keep the window open as they were weighted so that they shut if you tried to leave them open.

(Why did they not call us, they had our home and mobile numbers). We where asked to pay for our stay before they would book a taxi to take us to the our new hotel. We were not told the name of the new hotel or its location, just that it was about a 10 minute walk away. The taxi turned out to be a mini bus, which we think belonged to the hotel, as it was not marked as a taxi. We were then taken to the new hotel and dropped about 50m from the entrance. The driver pointed to the hotel and then was off, no chance to say no take us back. The Grand Royale is a very old hotel and in its day (1850'ish) would have been called Grand. We had booked the Shaftsbury as we like hotels with a modern interior. At reception they informed us that they knew we were coming but our room was not ready so we left our bags and went for a walk. On returning an hour later we collected our key and were told where our room was (not shown). The maid was still cleaning the room and we had to wait for another 15 mins. THE ROOM!! We had booked a Superior Room. Good points - yes it was clean, yes it had a bed and a TV. Bad points - The bed was a small double, we can't remember the last time we had a hotel bed this small!!! There was about a foot of space on either side of the bed, infact it was so close to the wall that my partner stubbed his toe on the radiator during the night. Looking on the bright side there was no chance of falling out of bed - there was no room!!! The bathroom - Yes it was new but very very small. Infact I am only short (5'2\") but I could touch both walls both width and depth ways!! The last time I was in a bathroom that size was on a caravan holiday. The side of the bath was also very high which made it hard to get out of. The shower panel was so small that the bathroom was flooded when you used it. We were in room 311 at the back of the hotel, our view was of the back of flats and shops and the rubbish bins. So closed the curtains and didn't look again. Now to breakfast. We had breakfast on the first day but did not bother on the second. Most of it was cold, the fruit juice had run out and we had to ask for them to refill the containers. Watch out!! We had paid for breakfast at the Shaftesbury but when we checked at reception they said we hadn't, we had taken our booking paperwork with us which showed breakfast included. The receptionist said she would take this off the bill but when we checked out we were still asked to pay for it. Also the bar was closed during our stay. Overall we were very disappointed this was not what we would have expected in a 4 star hotel and would not book with Shaftesbury Hotels again.

However reception informed us they were aware that it was a special occasion and that they had a lovely room for us, we thanked them but still not convinced until of course we went into the room, when we entered we were faced with 2 doors off a small hallway we entered the door on the right to be faced with what I can only describe as a suite, it was fabulous - we had a four poster king sized bed at least that's what it seemed like it was certainly bigger than the double bed we have at home, there was a hugh sofa and 3 large comfy chairs another 2 small chairs, a huge marble mantel & log fire which was serviced by gas (not sure if it worked as I didn't try it) beautiful built in wardrobes with plenty of storage space, we went back into the hallway to enter the room on the left, this was the bathroom and what a bathroom the bathroom also had a built in wardrobe, it had a beautiful huge bath (I think it was a double) with a shower over and the bathroom was nearly the size of the bedroom, I wished we had been staying longer we could have easily been happy staying in this suite for two, three or more weeks. I shall certainly stay there again but I would request the room number we had which was on the 5th floor as I did hear a gentleman complain while I was standing at reception about the size of his room he was not happy. But I can only say I am pleased I did not change the hotel and that I did voice my concerns about the problems, as perhaps this helped with the room I was allocated. Susan and Davey.

He said it would be ok and did not suggest alternative garaging. When we returned that evening we had a parking ticket. My furious husband tackled the reception manager and was told everyone!!!! knew not to leave a motorbike on the pavement?????? And none of his staff would have advised us so. So ok a mistake could have been made, but he then added insult to injury by laughing in my husband's face about what he thought was his stupidity for leaving the bike there.

Frustrating, but the worst was yet to come. instead of the twin room, we were given a double room with an extremely uncomfortable \"day-bed\" in the corner of the room that was lumpy and about three inches off of the floor. We were also on the second floor, but the elevator did not go to the second floor for whatever reason. We were told by staff to check back in two days to see if a twin was available. One the third day of our stay, my sister saw not one but two large black cockroaches in our room. I thought she was kidding, but upon seeing them myself I immediately called the front desk, who was not surprised. A porter was sent up an could not capture the insects, and told us verbatim that this had happened \"two days earlier,\" and that \"if there is one, there are definately more\". I went to the front desk and demanded my money back so we could check into another hotel, but was told by the person in charged that he didn't have clearence to refund my money and that his manager would be in the next morning at 7:30. I asked that the manager be called at home, but this evidently could not be done. Of course my sister and I wanted to be moved to another room, but the only double room available was located in the basement--as the building is has an infestation problem, we refused. We were then offered two sinlge rooms, one on the third floor, one on the fifth floor--as we did not feel comfortable being so far away from eachother we refused. We were then offered two single rooms back on the second floor--where we saw the roaches to begin with. We agreed to take them though they were around the corner from eachother and not \"right across the hall\" as we were told. One rooms had an pungent sewage-like odor coming from the bathroom. We went back down to the lobby and told the staff that the room was unacceptable. As there was nothing else they could offer my sister and I spent that night in a single room that was so small we could not open our luggage at the same time, and we slept in a single bed. The next morning we were at the front desk at 7:30 am and were told the the manager was ill, and would be out for the day, and that another manager would be in at 9:00 am. We waited until 9 and were told that this manager would now be in at 10. We asked the staff to call the manager, and were told that the manager was aware of the situation, but they could not give us a definative time of his arrival. When the manager still wasn't there at 10 we went back to our single room and waited. The manager arrived at about noon, apologized and offered us a complementary breakfast which we quickly declined due to the roaches on the premesis. The manager offered to comp us for the previous night, but we insisted upon compensation for the last two nights of our stay as the last two nights were ruined due to the situation with the insects and the lackadaisical manner in which the situation was handled by the hotel management. The manager said that he was only authorized to comp one night, and asked us to write a letter to yet another manager to provide \"back-up\", so he could request compensation for two nights. We agreed despite the fact that we had spent our last full day in London waiting for a manager to show up and writing a letter explaining our situation to yet another manager. We gave the letter to the manager with his word that the two days comp would not be a problem. The next morning we checked out and spoke with yet another manager who at first said she was not aware of our incident, and told us to \"contact hotels.com for a refund as this was a last minute reservation\". I referenced the conversation with the first manager, and she was suddenly aware of our situation and agreed to put in writing that we are to be comped for two days or our immense inconvenience. When I arrived back home, I contacted hotels.com, explained the situation yet again and was told that I would be comped for the two nights. I appreciate the representative from hotels.com's willingness to correct the situation with far more effort that the hotel management, but I do not know if I will book hotels through any third party vendors as this horrific experience should not have accured in a four star hotel.

They looked after our bags whilst we were away. That's the good bits over with! When we returned we were shown to our room and I was expecting it to look a bit like the one on their website (foolishly) and couldn't believe my eyes when we saw our room. It was the smallest hotel room I have ever seen. It had 3 steps up to the bed and the wardrobe was on a sort of mezzanine level between the bed and the bathroom, speaking of which had no bath and could only fit one person in at a time. You had to lean up against the toilet to shut the door behind you! I immediately complained about this as it wasn't at all what I was expecting and was moved to another room which had a bath and was on one level. Again, this was a small room and wasn't at all how their website has you thinking it might look.

When I went back to Reception to ask what they had done I was told by their female Receptionist that there was nothing they could do about the floor, fridge or sink so offered me another room in the basement. The porters took our bags and we went to take a look at our 3rd room in the space of an hour only to find that this room had a window that was sealed shut, but otherwise seemed fine. We began to settle in and get ready to go out etc when we discovered that the TV didn't work so I called Reception who said it was probably the batteries in the remote so they sent a porter to change them over but that didn't work. After about 20 minutes they finally gave up and said it's broken. By this time I had had enough, I rang Reception to ask for a room with a dry floor, a fridge that worked, a sink with a plug, a TV that worked and a window that opened (by the way, this hotel is boiling hot all the way through for some reason so you NEED a window that opens) and we were told the only room that fitted this criteria was the first one we went to one 2 levels. We gave in and moved right back to where we started! All in all, a real disappointment! I was actually looking forward to this weekend away in a 4* hotel but came back VERY disappointed.

Other hotels charge a fortune for using the internet in the rooms, so this was a BIG positive; The staff at the front desk and porters are fairly friendly / helpful, although check in / check out can get quite hectic - and we had to sometimes wait awhile to have queries answered as there were people everywhere and only 2 people on the front desk; Its a great location next to Hyde Park, and close to both Queensway and Bayswater tube stations; Now for the negatives, which I must say were mainly to do with the housekeeping rather than the front desk / porters: We tried to check in at 9am on the Saturday and the room wasn't ready, which was fair enough.. so we left our luggage with them.. which is all ok. The negative was that we came back at 1.30pm and it wasn't ready, then back at 2.15pm and it wasn't ready... it wasn't until 3pm that it was ready because housekeeping were behind in cleaning the rooms; On the last night, housekeeping had not replaced our bathroom with 2 large towels (only small towels were replaced). At 9pm I called reception and asked for 2 large towels and was told they would send them up. At 10pm I called them again and they apologised that the porter was busy before and will send it up now. At 10.30pm my husband called them AGAIN and they said they will send them up right away. We finally had someone at the door only to tell us there were no more large towels left??! So he gave us 3 smaller towels. I didn't really enjoy drying myself from the shower the next morning with a face washer!! There was some problem with the laundry that day or something. The only other grumble would be that I found the housekeeping most days to be overall sloppy. One day we were out of tissues and it wasn't replaced. The bath/shower wasn't cleaned very well. That's it. We didn't use the restuarant / bar at the hotel so I can't comment on that. There are lots of restuarant / bars around Bayswater anyway.

The reception staff especially where second to none and our cases where stored \"FREE OF CHARGE\" till 7.00pm on the day we went home even though we had checked out of the hotel at 10.00am.

Upon arrival the hotel had never heard of me. The hotel manager was working on reception (no badge) and berated me in front of other guests for not having a printed confirmation. It was 7pm, so I failed to reach anyone at my office. The hotel people told me I was going to have to wait until their agents searched about 200 web sites to find my booking. After half an hour and watching other people go through reservation problems, I asked for the manager, only to get the same rude woman. She continued to berate me for 'assuming it was their fault', and told me that she was not responsible for my travel agent messing up. She was being rude and loud, and it was impossible to have a normal conversation. I am a very patient person, and would have had a sense of humour about sorting out the booking issue the next day, had I simply been given a room in the meantime. I was given the option of waiting indefinitely in the lobby until they found my booking, or paying in advance for two days as a walk-in booking and cancelling the travel agent booking. I couldn't cancel with the agent, as it's pre-paid, and she told me over and over again that I could not 'confirm a past booking' and get a refund. Eventually after about half an hour of wrangling with the manager, she agreed (visibly angry) to put me in a room with me paying up front on my card, and that if I came in the next day with my confirmation, she would refund the charges to my card. It therefore took me an hour of discord to get into my tiny, semi-functional room. The a/c problems mentioned in previous reviews are still happening, and my room was hot. The windows cannot be wedged open without stuffing the curtain behind, and doing that made light shine brightly into the room. The hallway to the bed was claustrophobic, and I couldn't move past the ironing board once I set it up. It was dangerous to iron my shirt because I couldn't move safely around the ironing board. The corridor absolutely must be a fire hazard. No water pressure. Next day I came back with the confirmation, and she was on the desk again. She told me that they had received the confirmation that morning, late, and that it was the fault of my travel agent. She agreed to refund my card, and continued to tell me it was my fault. I noticed that the confirmation had a 'hotel confirmation reference', including a staff name. I told her what it was and she confirmed that this person worked in the hotel reservation department, meaning that they did indeed confirm my reservation with my travel agents on the day it was booked, but didn't enter it into their system. So I had long, multiple conflicts with the hotel manager because they messed up, and they took their mistake out on the customer over and over again. Completely unacceptable. The last day, I had problems checking out, because they tried to charge me for the first day's breakfast (pre-paid inclusive by my travel agents), and again demanded my confirmation. She said I had to pay, and I had to ask her to read the confirmation again. I managed to get it sort out, but this delayed my departure.

Booked through hotels.com as a four star hotel, got a good price for a triple room. Thought it would be a nice hotel newly refurbished and newly open (since April this year). The lobby was well decorated and clean. So I thought, so far so good and I was actually starting to look forward to my stay there. Upon check-in the young woman told us that they did not have a deluxe triple room in the hotel so they were going to send me and my friends to another hotel. I asked her if it had the same star rate as this one, 4 star. And she said YES. They arranged for a taxi for us and they paid for it. They have probably overbooked pretty well because I heard her on the phone say: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a transfer, yes another one. OK. The taxi took us to Bloomsbury to a hotel called Euro hotel. The frontside was not promising but we decided to give it a chance and went in. There we found out that it was a 3 star bed and breakfast!!! They sent us from a 4 star hotel to a 3 star bed and breakfast! How is that possible? Usually when hotels have overbooked they send you to another 4 star hotel or upgrade you to a 5 star hotel, but they sent us to a bed and breakfast. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong the bed and breakfast was very nice, it was clean and small and the staff there was very helpful, but not what we had booked and not what we wanted. The lady who owns this bed and breakfast was very helpful. She showed us the fax that Shaftesbury had sent to Euro hotel. There it said please do not disclose rate to guests. But though for them we had already paid for the room and so we knew the price. So according to this fax, Shaftesbury was going to pay for our room at Euro hotel but was going to take the rest for themselves. The Shaftesbury was about 200 pounds but Euro hotel was about 90 pounds. We also called hotels.com and we were furious. They found it also very strange that the Shaftesbury hotel would downgrade us not upgrade. So they said that they were going to refund us these 200 pounds and also the 90 pounds for Euro hotel, as a compensation. I would not recommend this hotel Shaftesbury to anyone, unless they want to be treated very badly, because obviously the staff doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know anything about customer service.

When we arrived, there were two porters there who were more interested in chatting to each other than help us with our bags. At the reception desk, there were at least 20 people waiting to be checked in, some had been waiting for at least 30 minutes. When we were finally checked in, we were shown to the two lifts which looked like as if they were from Churchill's days. One of the lifts did not work so we had to wait 5-10 minutes for the other lift to come down. Meanwhile, the porter who took our bags was busily trying to sell us the various tours / taxis that he's affiliated with. Our room was on the ninth floor but we had to get out on the eighth floor to walk up two additional flights of stairs. When we opened the door, we could not believe our eyes. The room was the size of a closet. It was literally, as one of guests eliquently described it, \"a bed surrounded by four walls\". There was no room to move and the only window was a tiny porthole that is smaller than ones that you would find on Greek ferries. The water trickled out the shower and bath tap and the toilet leeked water constantly. We immediately asked for room change but were told that the hotel was fully booked out. The next day, they managed to move us to a slightly larger room which was one floor down but still in the roof attic of the building. The room overlook Inverness Terrace which is one of the noisiest streets in Bayswater. Opposite the hotel is a backpackers hostel and all through the night, we could hear shouting and police sirens. To make matters worst, at 5:30 am, we were woken by loud bangings on our door. It turned out that the fire alarm has gone off (not that we heard it in our room) and that we needed to evacuate the building. We quickly dressed and walked down 9 flights of stairs and out to the street only to be told that it had been a false alarm. Had it been a real fire, we would have been roasted alive! Unbelievably, we struggled on and stayed in this hotel. The next day, the air-conditioning in our room broke down. We enquired politely only to be told that the whole building is without air-conditioning and that there's nothing they could do. We asked when it will be fixed only to be told again that they do not know. At no stage did the receptionist or the duty manager apologise to the guests about the condition of the hotel. We constantly overheard guests complaining about the heat and the various problems at the hotel. Being in the attic, the room was unbearably hot. We continued on like this for 2 more days. When we finally complained, they provided us with a fan but it only blew hot air around. We finally had enough after 7 nights in this hellhole and decided to cut our losses and move to another hotel. When we told the duty manager of our decision, he said that air-conditioning is not advertised on their website. I said to him that it was on there when I booked our room and he reluctantly admitted that it had been removed recently. This hotel has potential but they have completely stuffed it up when they decided to open without the basic infrastructure in place. The staff (from the duty manager down to the cleaners) have not been trained probably. An example of this is the constant knocking on our doors by the cleaners in the morning despite that fact that there was a \"do not disturb\" sign on the door. The cleaners do not speak and read English so that could be the reason why the \"do not disturb\" sign has to no meaning to them. Even so, basic training could have solved this lack of English. Not once during our stay did they vacumm the floor, change the sheets or wipe the bath down. One time, they even left our door open after they finished so we were totally shocked on our return in the afternoon to find our room completely open to the public. There is no service lift so the cleaners and the bags and bags of used towels occupied the only working lift, making it a good 10 minutes wait for the lift each morning. We have stayed at numerouse hotels around the world from hostels to 5 stars. You get what you pay for but if the hotel advertises itself as a 4 stars, it better has the infrastructure in place to back it up. It does not take much to make a hotel stay enjoyable. Clean room, sheets, towels and toilets are the basic ingredients. Next comes the overall well being of your guests (eg. running water and room temperature) and then the attitude of your staff towards the guests.

This is dirt cheap for central London at this time of year. Remember while reading these reviews, you get what you pay for. Back home this amount of money would get a real 4 star hotel, but in London, it does not. Things are more expensive here. If you want a room in the style of a US Hilton, you won't find it in London for under \u00c2\u00a3200. However, if you want somewhere nicer than a youth hostel for not significantly more than the cost for 2 people, this is the place for you. I would stay here again. The rooms are small by comparison to american hotels, but not by comparison to other London hotels. The photos they show on the website are much bigger than the one you will get if you book online. Maybe if you pay rack-rate you'll get one of those nice big rooms with big windows, but we sure didn't. We ended up with a basement room. The window lets in enough light, and is well enough secured to protect valuables. The entryway to the hotel is lovely and edwardian, and there's a red carpet in reasonable condition leading up to it. The rooms have been refinished beautifully into a dark modern style. The in-room internet works as advertised (seems to be about 8M/1M speed) and is free. And frankly, for me, these things are what matters. One comes to London to admire London, not spend time in the hotel room. That being said, it's not perfect. Most importantly, THERE IS NO AIRCONDITIONING. After verballing the manager, he admitted to me that the feeder cable from the power company cannot handle the current draw for all the airconditioners at this time of year, and the air-conditioning has been turned off to keep power supplied for everything else. He claimed work would commence in the next week to upgrade this cable, but since I won't be here, I wonder his sincerity. It's a reasonable excuse, especially since the air-conditioners were only installed this year, but still, the end result is no air-con in sweaty humid London. This is not the place for a romantic get-away at this time of year, unless you like being really hot and sweaty. Secondly, while there are nice 40 inch plasma TVs in the room, they seem to have a policy of not replacing lost or stolen remotes. Maybe there were never any remotes in the first place, I don't know, but this means all these \u00c2\u00a31000 TV's do is make a good clock (there is a small clock in the TV's frame). It seems insane to leave a \u00c2\u00a31000 TV dormant for the want of a \u00c2\u00a39 remote, almost as crazy as the notion of stealing remote controls from hotel rooms, but maybe I just don't understand people today. The staff suggested I buy one from a retailer in Oxford St if I wanted to watch TV. I passed them up on this suggestion, so sorry if you get my room next. There is no remote. Thirdly, and finally, we come to the bathroom. A frosted glass door assures that your choices for use of facilities at night-time are to light up the entire room, to your partner's chagrin, or remain in darkness, to your peril. There is no door or curtain for the bath/shower, nor any extractor fan. Additionally, while the refit was only finished in April (or much later, if other posters are to be belived), there are brown stains in the ceiling of the bathroom of my room. The powdery nature suggests mould to me, but the pattern looks like a leak from above. Either seem feasible. The staff seem reasonably helpful, although the first three of them I spoke to had never come across the concept of an extractor fan in the bathroom and management were less than forthcoming over the exact cause of the lack of airconditioning, but they did have someone to help us to our room with bags. Again, if you're from north america, you probably won't like the staff, but don't worry, it's nothing personal, they're just not fishing for tips like many you've met back home. I haven't checked out yet, but I assume they're not going to try to trip me up with some hidden charges. They do seem honest enough.

There was no possibility to close that window with a curtain or anything similar. Top floor had no access to the elevator, small steps to climb and small floors. Nothing you want to do with luggage. Didn't seem the Hotel has any Bell Boys available to help the hotel guests . What a horrible stay, not to mention, that the Hotel had no Bar, no Restaurant and no Minibar in the room.

I had to haul heavy luggage up a narrow flight of stairs instead of taking the lift as advertised. Ah well, I thought at least I could pop some ice in the fridge and have a cold drink - however the refrigerator did not work at all. The hotel room smelled wretchedly of rotting mildewy carpet and mould due to overflow from the ensuite soaking the bedroom carpet. This was impossible to avoid, as the entire ensuite (including toilet, hand basin and shower) was approximately 1x1m wide and the drain didn't - even after a shower the night before and in 32 degree heat, the entire floor was still awash with water the following morning. It was actually not possible to stand crossways in the shower area without one shoulder touching the wall and the other hip hitting the basin. Even the window could not be opened properly to provide any sort of ventillation to the room. Other problems: no informaiton in room so you can't telephone reception; no newspaper, trouser press or hairdryer as advertised; poor cleaning (stained coffee cups, half-used shampoo bottle from previous guest left).

For the occasion of my girlfriend's birthday, it seemed right to make it a bit special. So I booked a 'superior' room well in advance to ensure it would be a good one. We arrived in the morning and found the hotel without a problem. It was a little disconcerting that when we arrived at reception, we had to wait to check-in behind two groups of people, both who were complaining about service and hotel conditions. I hoped their experiences would be a one off. Sadly they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, and at every subsequent journey past the hotel's reception, I witnessed another guest making a complaint. We were forewarned that the room we were given was 'quite compact', but air-conditioned. We were given the option of leaving our bags and coming back later in the afternoon, whereupon we could have a bigger room, but one without air-conditioning. Due to the workmen outside the hotel not holding back with their pneumatic drill, and a preference to keep the windows closed and air-con blasting (it was a very hot weekend), we opted for the 'compact' option. On the 9th floor. This involved carrying our bags from the lift on the 9th through very narrow corridors, and up a flight of stairs to the floor above (in the eaves) which must have been the servants' quarters, back when the building was a home. I had my fingers crossed that 'compact' was an exaggeration. Sadly, it was a rather generous description of the conditions. The double bed was just about the only thing that could fit in the room, with perhaps, 1 foot clearance at the sides and foot of the bed. There were bedside cabinets , a table with tea and coffee making facilities, a small wardrobe, and a very smart HD ready LCD TV on the wall at the foot of the bed (which had to be carefully navigated when attempting to get to the far side of the bed). This meant there was nowhere to store luggage. Sadly even the LCD TV was unnecessary as the signal being piped into the room was so poor, that most channels were unwatchable, and the rest with a degree of imagination. The bathroom was small but functional and everything was very clean and tidy - the cleanliness cannot be faulted. We decided to keep the room, on the basis of 'better the devil you know', and at least it was cool. It was after we had spent the day visiting the sights that we returned to the hotel and found the bathroom's flaw. The shower was barely a trickle. The power was so low that the water just followed gravity, and tilting the shower-head made no difference to the direction of the water. This, sadly, is not a feature I appreciate in a hotel room, and one of the biggest frustrations. On leaving the hotel (we'd checked out in the morning and left our bags with them for us to collect before catching the train home), we had to wait 10 minutes just for our bags to be returned to us, but were provided with a very prompt taxi back to Paddington. All in all, it was a trying stay, and if we were staying longer, with more luggage and without the ability to return home and get a proper shower, I would have made my thoughts known to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management. However, it seems my two-penneth would have been surplus to requirements as the complaints of the other guests covered all of mine and more. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a delightful building in a great location, and as stated above everything was kept very clean and tidy, and the staff were polite.

There is a reason why this hotel offers such great reductions and the reason is because it is possibly the worst hotel (for the money) you can stay in when in London and has clearly built up a reputation as such. Here are the reasons you should not stay at this hotel, even if you get a great deal: 1. On checking in we had had to wait over half an hour to be seen while staff dealt with complaining guests. 2. There was no record of our booking 3. We were booked into the wrong room on two occasions 4. We got stuck in the lift for 10 minutes while inept staff tried to get the doors open (no sign of any maintenance staff.

We were on the 8th floor of the hotel and had to use the stairs (see above) although we did get help with our bags from a porter (eventually) 6. We had to avoid mountains of rubbish and laundry in the corridors, which apart from not looking very appealing is a fire hazard. 7. Our room was less than 3 metres by 3 metres in size (this is a deluxe double room remember) and the bathroom door could only be opened half way because it hit the bed. 8. Although there is hot water the water pressure is so low it makes the bath and shower almost redundant (it looks nice though) 9. The air-conditioning is unreliable or just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work 10. Check out took 45-minutes due to complaining guests. On a more positive note, the cooked breakfast was very good (although it was stone cold) and the breakfast area is well decorated apart from the big water leak in the ceiling which drops onto the floor in the middle of the restaurant.

Without asking or saying where this sisterhotel was or that we agreed she started to call for a taxi to bring us there. After making clear we had no intention to go anywhere else we were put in front of a senior (also poorly English speaking) Russian looking lady and after some discussion and outed frustration from our part we were finally offered the two double rooms we had booked for in this hotel. Note: The following guests that arrived got exactly the same treatment! After this we were finally guided to our rooms by a very unpolite Kazachstan monkey looking male type asking us unusual questions what we were going do here, where we were coming from eaxctly, etc.. in a Russian KGB style. Once he showed us the storage place they called our room we were shocked. The bed was sitting tightly sqeezed in between the two walls by which we couldn't even pass the bed. Only by crawling over it with our luggage to get to the other side where the tiny bathroom was located with a small window that had no opening. The storage space we were sitting in had no ventilation just an airco that was recirculating the air in this cramped space. It was awful to be sitting in let only to sleep here! This counted for both rooms we got. Complaining at the reception about this storage space offered by them didn't give any reaction whatsoever besides saying that this is how this hotel is made. Note: You are being fooled by letting you believe from the images they show from their hotelroom that the spaces are according to standard. They aren't at all ashamed to put you in a cramped storage space. The next thing we got to hear is that we had to pay an extra charge for the breakfasts because it wasn't included in the booking we made. I got very angry that they asked for my credit card to charge if we want this against an additonal 20 British Pounds per couple. I had all the details of the booking with me which mentioned breakfast included. but the shear attempt to let us pay again extra is one of having no manners or understanding at all in what role they were as speaking to their guests. We stayed there for two nights: The corridors in this hotel are long,warm, smelly and very narrow. There is no ventilation or easiness to find fire-escapes (there are but only at the far end of each long corrider!). So to us this was also a scary and dangerous place to stay in, in case something would happen. The Kazachstan personnel that came in the morning to clean the rooms had to sit on the laundry lying on the floor otherwise we could pass them to go out! The first evening we come back the hotelcard given to us to open the roomdoor wasn't working. We were sitting on the ninth floor. When we wanted to go back one of the two elevators was broken. When after long waiting for the remaining elevator we got down to the reception to receive a new card. When we wanted to go up again the remaning elevator was also broken. Not wanting to go up nine floors late in the evening in a sweaty hotel we had to wait for a technician from outside to come and repair the elevators. 40(!!) minutes later and many other also waiting guests were able to go up again Conclusion: For a newly recently opened and refurbished hotel this is a nightmare place which is beyond any imagiation or belief in a place to stay for a visit to London. Therefore I do not understand that e.g. the British Tourist Organisation or any other authority can approve of such a place offering these low standards of services and at the same time charging these rates.

Once in our room (after finding only 1 key card worked!) we were pleasantly surprised as it was actually really quite nice with a very comfortable bed, lovely bathroom and large plasma TV. However, the air conditioning was on full blast and it took us a while to figure out where the controls were as there are no instructions of any kind in the room! We guessed that reception was 0 on the phone so called down to ask someone when breakfast was and to ask about the extrememly poor picture on BBC1 - the studios of which were in shouting distance! Someone did come up but couldn't do anything so we attepted to watch the World Cup later that evening and make guesses as to the goal scorers through the fuzzy diagonal lines travelling across the screen! The next morning we packed our things and headed out of the room for breakfast. I pressed the down arrow button on the lift and we waitied, and waited, and waited! it was only when I got fed up and pressed the up arrow as well that the doors opened and we found the lift had been waiting there all the time! It was about this point that i tripped over something, only to discover it was a plastic plaque lying on the floor telling you which way your room number was! We both agreed it hadn't been there the day before! We had left ourselves 25 minutes to have breakfast and check out but when we got to the restaurant there was a queue of around 7 people, the first of whom had been waiting for over 10 minutes already just to be seated! We decided that we would never get seated, served and eat in time so left and checked out.

Yes, the location near Bayswater tube station is great (which serves the Circle line that runs around London; the Queensway station that is even closer on another line is closed until next year), but I would never have dreamed of staying at such a dumpy place. I think there were even better places on our block, so look into those maybe. I could be wrong though; the place was pretty full with visitors from the Continent and the US.

A very interesting site in a good location, but as a hotel...? It was built by King Edward for Lilly Langtree with lavish wood carvings, beautiful outdoor stonework, and stained glass windows but the royalty stops at the creaky elevator. The rooms were parcelled out on the smallest possible scale. It was like staying in a closet. The beds were not comfortable though the linens seemed clean. The bathroom was amazingly small and you had to be an accomplished gymnast and contortionist to take a shower without turning the floor into a duck pond. The general decor was neo-classical dinge. Though it was summer, I am convinced that the heat was turned on. The hall was hot and the public toilet near the dining room was a sauna. Totally unusable. The dining room was only good if you sat next to an open window. The help was friendly but clueless. A girl in reception lost an incoming phone call to me. Harry, the assistant manager from Cyprus was a very nice person who gave us some good tips. They also have nice hard candies at the desk. Breakfast was continental. The juice was passable. The rolls were OK. The croissants ran the gamut from microwaved to inedibility to pretty good. The add-ons to semi-English breakfast were also pretty good. Bacon and eggs or sausage and eggs for 2.50 additional. A breakfast like that kept us going til the afternoon. The second night we ate dinner at the hotel because we were too tired to go out to Queensway. Only two of the many tables were set for dinner. We had to rouse the Spanish waiter(cook?) from his evening newspaper and convince him we wanted dinner. Even he couldn't believe that someone actually wanted to eat there! My wife had roast beef and I had roast lamb. My plate of lamb looked exactly like my wife's plate of beef and tasted suspiciously the same though the waiter swore it was lamb. The food was was the best that comes out of a can! And of course the room was insufferably hot. The location was good, 5 minutes walk to the Bayswater tube station. (Beware of long lines at the beginning of off-peak time at the station.) Queensway, a 3 minute walk from the hotel has more mediocre restaurants per square inch than any other place I've seen. We ate at a bad Chinese restaurant (recommended by hotel people) the first night and didn't get too adventurous after that. One morning we beefed up our continental breakfast with an egg McMuffin, a cheaper alternative than the in-house add-ons. My overall impression of the hotel: we were able to put up with it because London is such a cool place and we only slept there. It's no resort hotel, just a crash pad with the trappings of Fawlty Towers. Only John Cleese was missing! A more interesting hotel at that price is probably difficult to find but abandon all your hopes of comfort at the door.

The room was tiny, the bathroom can only be entered sideways. That bathroom - in fact the entire hotel - needs a thorough cleaning and modernisation. The room itself was just about adequate, and as we were both shattered, the fact we had two twin beds was bearable; certainly don't plan a romantic weekend in this one. The TV was tiny and antiquated and had only three - obviously terrestrial - channels. The lift felt cramped and unsafe, the garderobe (luggage room) was minded by an asleep off-duty barman, and a cockroach met us as we came out of our room. On the plus side, the check out is a very sociable 12 noon, and late check outs are available at a price. Breakfast - continental - is provided in the price which once again was acceptable for the location at \u00c2\u00a360 for the night, although as we didn't get up for it I can't comment on the food! The hotel's location is another positive point, between Bayswater tube station and Kensington Gardens so it's handy for exploring.

Even in no-star hotels in continental Europe, \"continental breakfasts\" are better in every point of view. And an english breakfast here would be expensive, if not dangerous. Nobody tries, anyway !

The subway from Heathrow is about $7.50 US and takes about an hour. We suggest getting an all-zone pass like we did so you can use it all day (about $11US). The staff was kind and stored our luggage in the bar and allowed us to register, but had to wait until after 2:00 to get a room. We had a train pass and had no trouble checking in at 7:00pm on the 8th floor. Yes, only one elevator worked, but we rarely used it because our room was next to the wide staircase which is all handcarved and carpeted. The staff gave us anything we requested. The room was big enough and we had a full-size bathroom. Hotwater was hard to come by. We were charging our camera in the hall for two days until we asked about an outlet. You had to move the bed to get to it. There are no tea/coffee pots in the rooms (as stated on their website). I did hear a man ask the frontdesk for a hairdyer and he got one for a deposit fee.

Certainly the room was not as large as we would expect to find in the states, but it was acceptable. Now the bathroom was another matter....it WAS tiny, a large person would find it totally unusable, but we simply found it funny. You could sit on the toliet and your legs were under the sink. We had plenty of hot water and our room was well heated, to the point we left the window open during our stay. The bed was a little lumpy, but not so bad that it was uncomfortable. We saw no mold in the bathroom, nor cockroaches, mice or any other vermin during our stay. The lobby area IS beautiful and did not seem dingy or dirty to me. It IS old but I found it to be quite interesting. They were putting up the Christmas tree when we were there (late November 2004) and it was lovely to see the lights on it through the beautiful front windows at night. The staff was either friendly or cold, but never really rude, although not one of the staff I encountered was english and they all spoke with very heavy, hard to understand accents. It is odd they make you turn in your room key everytime you leave. There was only one working elevator and as mentioned before, it always seemed to stop on one floor although no one had rung for it....maybe the hotel is a bit haunted? The location couldn't be beat, a few doors down from Hyde Park and Kensington Palace/Gardens. Around the corner was the Queensway tube station. We felt very safe walking around this area, even coming back late at night there seemed to be quite a few people still out on the streets. Just around the corner was a very good pizza joint, seems to be a chain in London that was just like eating pizza back in the states, good to know if you're traveling with teenagers or young children.

As with the lobby the lounge, bar and main staircase were all breathtakingly beautiful. I've never seen anything like it, not that I've stayed at many hotels, but this for me was perfect. Our room was small, but it was fine for us. I mean we had a small bathroom and a double bed, a closet and a small TV and that was all we needed.
