Stars Inn is one of those secret gems that you only tell your close friends about, and I am definitely planning on staying on my next visit.

He then offered me one last room, and since it was better than the first 2, and it was getting later in the evening, I took it.

I wanted to stay in a place close to Beverly Hills and yet would not be expensive. Searching through the internet, I found the Stars Inn. Making a reservation over the phone was easy. The rooms ranged from $60 to $90 plus tax. I chose a room with a queen size bed for $60 plus tax. The manager did not get a deposit nor my credit card information but assured me that the room would be reserved on the days I specified. Indeed, when I arrived at the motel, room 1 was reserved for me. The place was surprisingly quiet, considering it was along Santa Monica Blvd. It was only a 3 night stay but I could say it was a pleasant one. For $60 the room was fairly clean, with a refrigerator, a microwave, cable TV and wireless internet ( I paid $5 to use the internet). I was even surprised that the room had space for a small dining table. It had a small kitchen counter, too. The bed was comfortable but I could not sleep well with only 2 pillows, so upon my request, the manager gave me an extra pillow. I was delighted to see that the motel was located just across the street from an upscale mall. And I would drive just 10 minutes to my business destination in Beverly Hills . One or two rooms in the motel were being renovated when I was there but convenience was not compromised. I would be staying again at the Stars Inn when I go back to LA in December and bring my younger sister with me. The place would be ideal since I would be taking my sister to see Universal Studios Hollywood and take a tour of the city of LA.", "Date": "July 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chennai", "Title": "\u201cSafe Stay\u201d", "Author": "Jyotish", "ReviewID": "UR15377812", "Content": "Had to stay in Century City for a 3 month assignment.

Would not stay here again!\u201d", "Author": "mcombs", "ReviewID": "UR8823579", "Content": "My husband and I had to attend a reception and film screening at the Century City Mall in Century City, so I did a Google search to see what hotels were close by, since we preferred something within walking distance. The Stars Inn popped up, with two flattering reviews here on TripAdvisor. So I called to make a reservation (it was a bit difficult finding their phone no.). The lady I spoke with just took my name but not my credit card number, so I was a bit perplexed about that. I told her I needed to have confirmation so she suggested I email them and they would email back a confirmation, which they did--but there was no confirmation number. She said they would hold the room until 4 p.m. and quoted me $70 for one night. When we arrived, around 1:30 p.m., before I could say anything, the man at the desk suggested we take a look in room 20, upstairs, which he said was their best room. We did a quick glance around and told him it would be fine. He said it would be $90, and when I told him I had already reserved a room for $70 and showed him a printed email copy, he then said we could take room 14 downstairs for $70, or have room 20 for $80 (plus tax, so it was $91). We decided on the upstairs corner unit since it seemed a more secure location. Well, for $91 it was NOT a good deal. It would be worth about $65. Although spacious, with working window air conditioner, ceiling fan, telephone and color TV (I had to ask him for the remote), the shower curtain was filthy, as was the cabinet under the bath sink. The ceiling of the bath was dirty and needed painting--as did the room ceiling, which had patches. The room had two armchairs, queen size bed (no blanket), old desk, dresser, end tables with lamps, microwave, refrigerator/freezer, kitchen counter, two bar stools. Two lights were out in the bathroom (no bath window curtain if you wanted to have the window open). There was no shampoo, much less a hair dryer (luckily I packed one)--and just 3 tiny bars of soap. If we hadn't had to attend an event across the street, there's no way we would have stayed here. This motel may be ok for younger people, but I was also a bit concerned about the security. The people next to us in room 19 opened and closed their doors often late at night and very early in the morning, making considerable noise. The outside doors could use some paint, too. The bath and room were clean but not THAT clean. With a bit of upgrades, the place could be so much nicer. The Century City Mall is so handy, this motel would be a great place to stay for a weekend shopping excursion. We have traveled the world, and I have to say this was one of the worst places (if not the worst) we've stayed. Especially for $91!! I plan to print this out and email it to the owners.
