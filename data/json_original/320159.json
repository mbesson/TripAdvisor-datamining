My EIGHTH visit to Venice for Carnevale 2012, took an old mate and his lady and they were happy enough. Our rooms were adequate, warm ever this time of year Feb 17th - 21st, and the beds comfortable.

This is your typical small and privately owned European hotel of which many are to be found in Venice. Location: This is one of the stronger points of this hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a short walk from either the train station, bus station at Piazzale Roma or from the water bus stop. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not far from the Grand Canal and has excellent access to local shopping and restaurants. If you come from the airport, take the ATVO bus to Piazzale Roma and then walk across the bridge. The bus costs 3 Euros per person and is much better than the public bus that runs the same route. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 10 minute walk from the bus stop to reach the hotel and its much cheaper than a water taxi from the airport. The hotel is off the main streets so it was quiet in that area at night. We heard very little noise from either outside or inside the hotel. Check-in: We greeted by a friendly front desk person. Our room was already assigned. There are no elevators or lifts to be found so you will have to haul your luggage up the stairs. We were on the second floor so that was manageable. The staff will assist with luggage if you request it. Room: Small but typical of a European hotel and especially in Venice. It was actually larger than I expected after seeing the rooms on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any strange smells but it could have used a good cleaning. The ceramic tile floor was very dirty as were the curtains which were full of dead mosquitoes. It seemed as though the housekeeping staff just makes the bed, wipes down the bathroom and takes out the garbage. We had a double bed which was two single beds pushed together. It was comfortable so no problems there. The bathroom was small but well designed. The shower was small and the water pressure fine. The problem was the water temperature. There was no way to control it and keep it at a steady and comfortable temperature. It would be boiling hot one moment which forced us to make it colder. That worked for a little while but then it would turn freezing cold which forced us to make it hotter again. The solution was to turn the water off after getting wet and than lathering up and then rinsing off. That worked better for us. Make sure you leave the bathroom door open when you leave the room as there is no other ventilation other than doing that. There was a small air conditioner in the room. This didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work all that well. I set it to the lowest possible setting and this set off a trickle of cool air into our room. The good part was that it did go towards the bed but still wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a total relief. On our first night, we tried to counter this by opening the window. That backfired as were literally attacked by mosquitoes in the night. The next night, we tried sleeping with repellant but that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very comfortable due to the smell of that. Provided that the housekeeping staff didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn the air conditioner off, the room was somewhat comfortable when we got back in the evening. We managed and adjusted by stopping at the room in the mid-afternoon to make sure the air was on in the room. This way it was somewhat comfortable when we got back in the evening. We had a small television that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. We asked the front desk who said that they would check it but it never was repaired. It only shows local Italian television anyway so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss much. Staff: Overall they were pretty friendly and helpful. My wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s luggage did not make our connecting flight to Venice. It was delivered to the hotel the next day and the staff kept an eye out for it while we were out for the day. We were in our room when it arrived and they brought it right upstairs to us. Make sure you give them your room key when leaving the hotel. We did not know this until our second day and got a bit of a friendly lecture from them. This is how they keep track of if you are in the hotel or not. The key is attached to a very heavy key chain so you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to carry that around anyway. The front door is closed and locked between 2:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. so you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to get into the hotel during those hours. The staff speaks at least decent English. There is an apparent rift between the front desk staff and the housekeeping staff as we saw them arguing quite often near the lobby. Breakfast: We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t qualify for it as we had a room only reservation. This was fine as we heard from other guests that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that great. Finding a place to eat was not a problem in that part of town. The breakfast room itself is small and there may be a wait when you get there. Other comments: The building, like the rest of Venice, is very old. This hotel is showing a lot of wear and tear. There were numerous scratches and nicks in the walls. The common areas and hallways really needed a good cleaning and perhaps a coat of paint wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurt either. This is a basic, no frills hotel. There are not many amenities to be found here. I did find a small vending machine that sold water, beer and sodas. That was all. Overall, not a bad stay. The location can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beat and the adjustments we made to the issues we encountered made our stay better. Considering how much we paid, I am not going to complain about too much. Since we were in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend much time here other than to sleep and shower. I suggest everyone else who stays here does the same! The price is good and if you are looking for a place to stay without breaking the bank, this is a good choice.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Merida, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cNot bad...\u201d", "Author": "El-Yuca-Ingles", "ReviewID": "UR66555484", "Content": "Stayed one night here; excellent welcome from friendly receptionist when we arrived late morning; although the room was not ready she let us leave our stuff, and we went out to explore.

If considering this hotel bear in mind it is mostly young students who can be noisy so if this is a problem book elsewhere. Very good location close to the station and vaporetto stop. Good selection of shops and restaurants practically on the doorstep.", "Date": "September 21, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Atlantide", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d320159-Reviews-Hotel_Atlantide-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$79 - $256*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Cannaregio375 / A</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Cannaregio</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30121</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "320159", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/6f/ca/6fca231f024a13b608e553cbb1df31683large.jpg"}}
