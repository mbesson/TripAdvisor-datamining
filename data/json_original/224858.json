The parking lot was a disaster - 24 hours after the snowfall they still hadn't cleared even a walking path to the front door. Getting into their parking lot, on a hill, required 4-wheel drive. The rooms were just OK but an up-grade is needed. Service was very poor - when we returned from our flight we had to phone three times for pick-up.

This hotel is falling down around it's occupants. Had we not gotten to the place so late, we definitely would have gone elsewhere. This place should be condemned. We kept our shoes on the whole time and did not let our baby off of the bed. They told us they had a crib, but when then brought it down, it was broken on one side and the plastic covering was half way torn off of the pad, if you could even call it that. I wouldn't dare put my child in it, so he had to sleep with us. They failed to give us the wake up call we requested, their courtesy number didn't work from the airport, the place was horribly dirty. Should I go on? The place is so outdated it has baseboard heating and reeks of mildew. My husband went down the hall to find an entire hallway with insulation falling out of the ceiling and buckets of materials strewn through the hallway. OHH..and yes there were still people staying in that hall! I would venture to guess this is a place where tricks are turned.

Instead of the charge agreed for all, they put the same charge through twice. July 28 and again August 9. We contacted the hotel and followed their directs to get this corrected. So far, we have called them every week at least once if not 3 times to get this sorted out. All we have heard for the past 7 weeks are excuses and claims that their written accounts do not show the double payment and apparently they do not think the VISA bill may be more acrrate. Now just when they say they wil fix it cause they agree to the mistake, they up and loose our paper work so won't be doing. Tis is followed by another excuse about time and too much paperwork. I demanded this be fuixed with 48 hours. And I was hung up on by the manager.I now see that others have claimed similar stories about poor service and billing problems. BBB has a file on them. The manager lacks customer service and appears to not care about fixing their mistakes, or is intentionally keeping the moeny. Unclear which is correct. Perhaps both.

Their website looked decent and we were lured in by their cheap park 'n fly rates. We forgot our confirmation number at home which caused some confusion at the front desk. Once it was cleared up, they arranged for a shuttle to take us to SeaTac. Our car parked in their lot for a total of 5 days and there was no damage or stolen items from it as had happened with some of the other reviewers.One friend had an earlier flight back to Seattle than the rest of us so she went ahead and checked in first. According to her, there was a strand of hair found in the bathtub that was definitely not her own and at one point when she was lying spread out on the bed, resting from her flight in, the door to the room suddenly opened and one of the male staff walked into the room. Needless to say, she was shocked and told the man calmly that our room was already occupied. Apparently the man had problems with english and somehow managed to relay that he was there to check the smoke alarm. The door was quickly locked and bolted once he was done.This hotel is also apparently in a seedy area of Seattle. There is a subway about a 3 block walk down a fairly busy road and when she walked there later on in the day to grab some lunch numerous cars drove past honking their horns at her and some men even yelled out lewd comments as they drove past. Dressed in jeans and a hoody my friend was made to feel like a hooker and ended up staying in the hotel (motel??)for the rest of the day until our flight arrived later on that night.The 'non-smoking' room reaked of stale smoke. We opened the window to air the room out a bit, but there were no screens and we were at ground level so did not feel safe leaving it open during the night. The room itself was very spacious though. It had 3 double size beds as well as a couch pull-out, a kitchen with microwave and full sized fridge and stove, and a small eating area. The bathroom was really small in comparison, and the toilet was crooked and not quite leveled. Shower pressure was on the light side and there weren't enough towels to use despite us telling them that there were going to be 5 of us there.There was a free continental breakfast provided. I didn't go down because I happened to be the last of 5 to use the bathroom in the morning so I didn't see what the conditions were. My friends brought me up some toast with peanut butter and a cup of apple juice. After reading the other reviews here, I'm just glad I was able to eat my breakfast in ignorant bliss.Overall experience, I'd hate to say this is the worst establishment I've ever stayed in, but it would be very close. It was a one night stay and I don't think we would've stayed another night if we had to. The rates were cheap and would be great for those on a budget, but I'd definitely splurge more for a more restful night at another hotel the next time I'm in the area.", "Date": "Sep 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR820885876", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "En_000"}, {"Content": "filthy and a broken shower There are no screens on the windows.

Just a reminder to those using this service, please remember to tip the shuttle driver. I saw this young man loading and unloading luggage and not receiving a tip from most and I personally saw this as an insult.
