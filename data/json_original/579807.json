We have also visited the melast Spa at the front of this hotel and found that to be great too.Not sure if we just got a crap room but hopefully this will save other people from the same dissappointment.", "Date": "Jul 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR424262503", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "cralinz"}, {"Content": "Still Loved the Melasti Bungalows!       dinner at bubba gumps!", "Date": "Oct 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR859509709", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "taga"}, {"Content": "\u9289\u253f\u5046\u9289\u6825\u4ef9\u93b8\u85c9\u6d16   showReview(21123114, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR267842431", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "jagat"}, {"Content": "\u95c8\u6b0d\u4eb1\u9287\u0446\u60e4\u9287\uff04\u6f43\u9287\u6219\u4ee7   showReview(19171560, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR274502406", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u93c3\u30e6\u6e70\u6d5c\u6052\u4f05\u704f\u6219\u4efe\u9287\u52e9\u5127\u9289\u55d0\u5137   showReview(19169819, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR390628955", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d579807-r23280117-Melasti_Beach_Bungalows_Spa-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "579807", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
