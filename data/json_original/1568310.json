We had a family room, two rooms with a door connecting. The space was very small, there was little room to walk around the bed to get to the bathroom or to set a suitcase. Also, the noise was incredible - the hotel is on the main route leading into Sultanahmet, immediately next to the train tracks. Between the endless traffic on the road and the trains passing by late into the night sleep was a challenge. The staff was very friendly and accomodating which was really the only redeeming characteristic. Definitely recommend staying a bit farther up the hill, away from the immediate street and train track noise. Check out Flamingo Apart - similar price, but great big rooms on a quiter street just steps from the Blue Mosque, etc...

We had what I believe was one of their 'premiere' rooms which is basically bigger than the standard room- I saw one of the standard rooms and they are very small. It was a nice size and had good facilities, with a little balcony and view of the sea. Also very clean and the cleaner changed our sheets and towels every day which was an unexpected bonus. The road outside is very noisy and busy during the day, though with the balcony doors shut you cannot really hear very much- in the winter this is fine, though in the summer it could be a problem. The manager was very helpful and hospitable, the other staff were pleasant. The hotel has a resident parrot! which is entertaining though quite noisy at times- we could hear her from our room on the top floor! we did not mind though this may not be the case for people who are not too fond of parrots! The breakfast was nice though the same every day, the managers wife (I do not know her name) makes delicious scrambled eggs! It was a little strange for us as we were the only guests for the 1st 2 nights so it felt very much that the staff were 'waiting' for us to vacate the room for cleaning each day, and for us to have breakfast. On the 3rd night some other guests arrived and were put in the room right next door to us- one warning- the walls are very thin and the tiled floors are very noisy with other guests around- these particular guests were very noisy and we could hear everything (!) I have worked in the hotel industry for the past 9 years and felt that as the hotel only had 2 rooms occupied, it seemed a bit silly to put the new guests right next door to us where they could be heard by all. it was my birthday on our day of arrival and the manager kindly gave us a complimentary bottle of wine. The hotel has a 'mini bar' in the bedrooms with soft drinks. I believe the hotel has a bar on the roof terrace which I assume is open during the summer months. We brought in our own alcohol and got told off by the female receptionist for requesting a cork screw- which was actually to open the wine they gave me for my birthday! so we just bought our own bottle opener from a local shop and kept it to our selves! A couple of small niggles- The manager made a reservation for a local fish restaurant in town which he personally reccommended saying it was owned by a 'friend' of his. We had somebody from the restaurant pick us up to take us there... The restaurant was right on the water front in town, though when we arrived we felt it was fairly impersonal and lacked atmosphere. The wine was very expensive (cheapest bottle was around \u00c2\u00a340) and the menu was not very varied. We are not cheapskates though are always looking for something 'different' and this was not our choice. We politely left money for the bread and olives we were given on arrival and made our excuses and left, the staff seemed a bit upset by the fact that we weren't impressed, though we tried to reassure them that it was not their fault- This is just a cautionary word to anyone who stays at the harmony hotel and is reccommended this restaurant. There are so many restaurants in Istanbul with alot more character and variety- wine is generally quite pricey in instanbul....maybe in england we are too spoilt with cheap booze! Also the manager booked us on a day tour which both myself, and my boyfriend understood to be priced as turkish lire... it was actually in euros and we swiftly got off of the coach when we realised and did the tour ourseleves for alot less money- the hotel is brilliantly conveniently situated for all the main attractions for sight seeing in Istanbul. The free airport transfer was a great bonus and the manager offered us the room untill 3pm on our last day without us asking! though the hotel was empty so I guess that is why he was so generous. I would reccommend this hotel to people who are easy going and like a friendly service without any fancyness and too much expectation, this way you will be pleasantly suprised!", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHarmony hotel manager and staff excellent\u201d", "Author": "186338Sunshinekenbar", "ReviewID": "UR87701881", "Content": "We stayed in hotel for 1 month in january 2010 the manager Selcuk and staff were friendly and helpful, excellent service, we will be staying there again in Decembe this Year 2010 the Hotel is clean, and breakfast excellent, large TV, comfortable room , we were made to feel like part of the family, we were very happy there we recomend the hotel for family and every one .

So we found the amazing 'Romantic Hotel', charming room, lovely lovely staff - and paid for two night s(which is all they had available). When we arrived back on the second day to collect more of our stuff, having spent the night at the Romantic, they did seem genuinely upset that the state of the room made us pay for a separate hotel, and moved us to another room for two nights - but it was in basement, there was no air, no view, it was better but not good enough. So we still stayed in the lovely Romantic Hotel, went back to basement room for one night, and then was upgraded for our remaining two nights. This room, was not great either - tiny, leaky shower, the noise from people coming up and down the stairs (tiled, not carpeted) woke us on numerous occasions.
