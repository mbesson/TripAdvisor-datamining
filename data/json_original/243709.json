I gave more weight to the reviews that were recently written by travelers with several reviews who said it was decent, but was sadly disappointed. I don't expect much from a Motel 6 and am usually happy with stays at their motels, but this particular motel fits the stereotype of bad Motel 6s. When I checked in, there was a policeman there talking to a guest at one of the rooms. Not a good sign, but every motel has had the police show up for some reason or another, so I let it go. Check-in was quick and my room was in the very back facing an apartment complex. The outside garbage cans were full with 3-4 bags piled up beside it (and it wasn't housekeeping's trash.) And the parking lot had obviously not been cleaned up in a while. My room had that typical musty smell that many Florida motels have. Hairs in the shower and a clipped nail on the telephone. Yuck, but the bed and linens were clean and I needed to meet my friends so I left. That night, the garbage was still piled up at the outside cans at the stairs. In the morning, there was no hot water for my shower. I was gone all day and when I returned around 5, there were two police cars at the motel! Police two days in a row - definitely a bad sign. My room had been \"cleaned\" - they had replaced the towels which I had neatly hung up but left the used washcloth in the bottom of the tub. And they obviously didn't vacuum. New garbage was now piled outside one of the garbage cans. I took a quick shower and headed back out. Later that night, the TV was out for a while due to heavy rain - guess that is pretty common with satellite TV. I told the employee at the counter about my complaints when I left, and she apologized profusely, but that was it. Although the police were there twice, I never felt unsafe and there seemed to be a lot of families at the motel. Had I more time to find another motel, I probably would have spent some more money to stay elsewhere. But at $28/night, it was too tempting to take the risk so I could spend my money elsewhere.

The rate was just $30, and we had a clean room with two double beds. Despite the late hour, the front desk clerk was friendly and efficient. Our room was clean, the sheets were fresh, and the bathroom was well maintained. The rooms here are small and lack many of the amenities of more expensive properties, but if you just need a place to shower and sleep, this Motel 6 is a great deal. The exterior of the motel definitely needs some work, but we weren't there long enough to care! It's less than a mile from World Drive, so access to Walt Disney World is a snap if you have a vehicle. A couple of tips: there's no resort fee - hooray! There's also no shampoo in the rooms (BYO), but there is soap.

There were many cars in the parking lot, but we hardly saw any people; just 1 woman walking her dog. This is in stark contract to the Motel 6 EAST Gate which had lots of freaks / druggies / scary people roaming around. We tried getting a room by the East Gate / Old Towne area but were scared off by all the noisy / drunk / unsavory type people. The West Gate area is much quieter and seems much safer. This West Gate area is just west of I-4 on hwy 192 (Irlo Bronson) . There were many hotels and restaurants in a few short blocks. There was a Perkins restaurant right in front of the motel and a Denny's, McDonalds, Shoneys, Ihop, Waffle House, Golden Corral, Bob Evans, and more just a block or two away. Pros: - super cheap ($35) - very clean - new paint and carpet (in room 245 anyway) - good breakfast places nearby - no bugs - quieter area (compared to EastGate and I-drive) - pool looked very clean Cons: - very small room (barely fits 2 double beds) - no shampoo, only 2 tiny bars of soap - sink and tub drained very, very slowly - it's a 2 story motel with outside walkways, not a hotel", "Date": "January 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cGreat-Until we found the bugs!\u201d", "Author": "Juboo16", "ReviewID": "UR4600584", "Content": "Stayed in this Motel for 2 weeks and everything was going great, the staff were nice (well most of them, one woman was quite rude), the loaction was great, right near Disney and a Golden Corral!

Its located in the heart of tourist town, not far from Disney, etc. Tax, tag, title, out the door, I paid $28.32!!!!! I actually had a confirmed price of $34.19, but when I showed up, they said it was cheaper! It was quite clean other than the carpet perhaps being a bit warn. No hair dryer, no refrig, no iron or ironing board, no clock or radio. Although I didn't use it, the pool looked quite inviting. It sits back from the road a bit so there's no traffic noise. Be cautioned that there are two Motel 6's on this same stretch of highway, they're about 6 miles or so apart; I went to the first one I hit and they sent me to the other one, but would have put me up there and canceled the other reservation, but only had a smoking room. They may not have king beds, double check if this is important to you. I had two fulls. When her husband is out of town, I travel to Kissimmee to visit my girl friend, and will continue to take advantage of this great bargain when I do.", "Date": "November 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Breda, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGreat place!\u201d", "Author": "Corretje71", "ReviewID": "UR3528292", "Content": "This place was a great place to be for us!
