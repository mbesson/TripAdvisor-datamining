{"Reviews": [{"Content": "great for its price my friend gelo whom we met in macau suggested new king's hotel to stay, i checked in with my friend for 3nights from oct 14-17,2008. the room is small but clean, bed is not that soft but could be a refuge after a day's tiring tour. toilet is clean with bathtub. the receptionists are cool and always ready to be of help for directions, limited english though. our room was daily fixed. the most advantageous part of the hotel is its location. convenient stores around, bus stations steps away and the yau ma tei mtr is just 2mins walk. for me it was a blessing i discovered new king's holtel, surely i will be back there.", "Date": "Oct 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR573160009", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "glengonz"}, {"Content": "Too good to call hotel!! Last month, I went to hongkong with my boyfriend for 3 nights. And we decided for a budget hotel that location is near MRT. So most of hotel that we looking for is on Nathan. After checking in the internet, other hotel like YMCA and Evergreen is full and others also up price during the trade fair so I look into the discoverhongkong website and found this budget hotel New Kings hotel. For the price and location is match our situation.We went to hotel by bus from the airport , and the bus stop is just right infront of the hotel just only cross the Nathan street. After we saw the hotel sign and turn right at the corner we so surprise for the size of the hotel that so small. After check in we get to our room on 8th floor. The elevator is very small just only 4 pp maximum. The size of the room and bathroom is more shocking!!! Its very tiny we cant bary move or walk in to the room.The room quite old and a bit dirty. Only good thing is location only 2-3 mins to Yau Ma tei MRT and 7eleven just outside the door.I recommend to find a hostel for H$450 to stay rather than stay at here I think its only 1star hotel for me......", "Date": "Sep 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR407429090", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "piggypuffgirl"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d456267-r21019668-New_Kings_Hotel-Hong_Kong_Hong_Kong_Region.html", "HotelID": "456267", "Price": "\" id=\"hotel_456267\">"}}
