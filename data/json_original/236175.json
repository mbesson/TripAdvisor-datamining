I have stayed twice at Homs after trying a few other hotels in Rome, although others are more luxurious, but for the sake of my work trips I know what I am looking for and I found it at this hotel: very friendly and helpful staff, excellent wifi, clean room, good service, fine breakfast, and ofcourse the location is very good, a few steps from the Spanish Steps. The rooms are small but convenient, and do not expect anything out of the ordinary. The TV did not work good, for those who care about that it might be a problem; it is not something I care about in a hotel. This is Rome, so if you want to stay in the city center, expect some noise! I have stayed at two different floors, once on the first floor, and I felt that the noise was more substantial and I felt like the walls separating the rooms were a little thin, but here is a tip- never travel without ear plugs to urban centers! As for the breakfast, the highlight is the cappuccino! The restaurant is good, the bar is nice, and I recommend this hotel for those seeking a convenient hotel in the center of Rome. One last tip, the hallways are long and there are many steps between the different sections of the hotel, pack light!", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago USA", "Title": "\u201cPrimo Location, Comfortable Stay\u201d", "Author": "GlobalConsultant", "ReviewID": "UR121932441", "Content": "I was \"walked\" here by the sister hotel, Villa Morgagni, and not happy about it after a long day, but the Homs proved to be a very nice property.

It's steps away from the Spanish Steps (in one of the most fashionable areas in Rome--think NYC's 5th avenue) and blocks from the Trevi Fountain. We quickly learned that Rome is a completely walk-able city and we were in the heart of it. The hotel is on a busy, well-lit street and we always felt safe walking there, even at night. And even though the streets below were always bustling, we never heard any noise when our windows were closed. From the moment my fiancee and I checked in, Francesca, at the front desk, took care of us; booking restaurant reservations, recommending tours, and making sure our stay was comfortable. Our room was pretty small, but cozy. There was a tiny entrance way and the entire main room was taken up by the bed and 2 night stands. We were able to peek inside other rooms and noticed that ours was definitely one of the smaller ones without much storage space. We had to put our clothes in every little nook imaginable, and we stored our luggage under the bed, as there was no real closet, but we made due. The room was very nicely decorated with a very clean, bright, modern bathroom. The reason I didn't give cleanliness a \"5\" is because the shower had slight signs of age and what could have been small mold stains on the shower floor. The water pressure in the shower was great though! I also really didn't like that the entire bathroom sink was made of glass, which showed spots and messiness very easily. The room was cleaned every day though and never felt messy or dirty. The bed was large and very comfortable. There was a safe in the room, a fridge, and a flat screen TV.

Also, noise from toilet for a long time after flushing (a member of staff stopped it immediately by pressing the flush a couple of times - told this was a temporary fault).

You are Kidding Hotel Homs\u201d", "Author": "Worldtraveller2569", "ReviewID": "UR117844299", "Content": "First of all-to make the things clear-It's difficult to judge where the hotel rating comes from and the system used to reward it but it's DEFINATELLY NOT A 4* HOTEL. Nowhere nearer it in fact! 2+ at least unless one believes they are still living in 70's. I can imagine hotels have some freedome in labelling themselves with stars. However I wonder why websites and travel agents including leading, well known companies keep advertising the place as 4* while it is very obvious even for a diletant that it's not! Let me start with positives and there is only ONE-the location. It's a definate advantage of the establishment. About 50metres from Spanish Steps, Via Condotti (where many designer shops are) plus Piazza del Popolo, Trevi fontain, presidential palace, Forum, Capitoline Hill all within easy reach. It is even more difficult to overlook the hotel location when compare it to Termini station (not very pleasant and unwelcoming area) where a large number of hotels geared for tourists are situated. Now to negatives-as with majority of hotels in Rome (and Italy) the average quality and standards of accomodation are somewhat below of that found elsewhere in Europe. There is a continuos inflow of tourists to Italy guaranteeing bookings to owners and it seems that very little efforts are put to update hotels to comtemporary standards. The rooms in Homs are extremely tiny, more like student sleep place than a 4* HOTEL. Public areas look old and in desperate need of refurbishing (although a bathroom in my room showed some signs of being partially upgraded). It seemed that reception staff had no training of dealing with visitors whatsoever-upon my arrival there was no greeting, no smile-in fact one of the ladies at the reception had such an expression on her face as though she were about to punch someone on the face...One would get a feeling that hotel employees treat visitors not as guests deserving at least basic level of service but rather like unavoidable inconvenience. I guess one would have difficulties to believe that in high season that establishment charges well over \u00a3100.00 for tiny room! Needless to say-breakfast not included. I would say that the place is only good for those who simply wishes to use it as a base for exploring many magnificient monuments and sites of Rome. For all others who also look for a decent service, care and confort the place should be avoided. One more word of caution-there is a cafe on the corner, 10m away from hotel entrance (to the left) the same way leading to Spanish Steps. Avoid it at all cost! Can't even be called a tourist trap. It's much worse than that. Prices for drinks and food in central Rome are not particularly cheap. However in that establishment they will charge you twice of already highly inflated prices (i.e. 550ml bottle of Coke costs \u00a32.50 on average, you will pay \u00a34.50 there for pleasure to be served by a cashier who tries to deal with customers while chatting to some one on mobile)... To conclude the hotel is a very poor value for money with employees who hardly cares about visitors. On another hand Rome is a great city to visit, where history awaits you on every corner. Also perhaps sunny, blue skies and warm weather make it so much easier to forget negatives of Homs and remember the Eternal City.

Alright onto the review: we visited Rome as part of our Honeymoon tour from Northern Italy all the way down ending in Rome. I booked Hotel Homs because the reviews were all so positive and I really wanted to cap off the trip in a wonderful, luxurious way. Instead I got jack hammering outside my window until 4am, no joking. Let me start with check in - we arrived to the hotel after walking from the train station (not advisable, but we were happy doing it) and since we were back packing it, we clearly had big ugly back packs on. The hotel front desk actually made fun of us for back packing on our honeymoon. Really?! The room was spacious and clean but the paint was all marked up and uncared for, the bathrooms weren't clean and the shutters were broken. The room was a smoking room and we're non smokers so we noticed an unpleasant odor right away. The walls were also paper thin and we could hear everything that was going on in the LOUD room next door - I believe every screaming child in Rome was in that room. Yay honeymoon! We were on the road for 3 weeks so naturally I wanted to touch base with family and friends on the Wifi only to discover it cost 5 euros/hour!?! When you advertise wifi available it should be free or reasonably priced! It was also a bummer to realize that when they said breakfast available it wasn't part of the package like they made it sound. Their breakfasts started at 20 euros each. When you're paying as much as they cost, that was a shock. We decided to go out and check out the sights right away and asked the front desk for advice - she circled one district on the map and sent us on our way - really, there's only one area to see in Rome? good thing we had a good travel book with us. That night we went down to purchase some internet time only to discover the night clerk didn't understand English. I know it's not expected - but in a 4 star hotel I thought we would be pretty safe to bet english would be spoken. The next night is when bad went worse - construction started outside our window. No joke they were jack hammering directly below our window all night long. When we went downstairs to ask what time they were expected to stop the front desk clerk said 2am ish and that it wasn't his fault. I understand they have little control over it - BUT they should have warned us when we checked in! OR since we were a honeymoon couple who booked ages in advance maybe put us on the quiet side of the hotel?? Not just say not our fault... it's not like we were saying it was... we just wanted to know if there was light at the end of the jack hammering tunnel - which btw went on until 4am for three days running - we had little to no sleep the entire time we were there. For $200/night I would expect to 1. be able to sleep at night, 2. have access to the internet, 3. have a little help getting orientated in the city and a nice to have would be at least a coffee and pastry in the morning. Oh well, you live, you learn - cheap sometimes is the way to go!! OH and airport transfer is $50 euros! Ouch!

NEARBY: Just step outside, and you are in one of the most charming streets/arias of Rome. Small restaurants in the streets, so narrow cars have to bend their rear view mirrors just to get by.

The first night we checked in the air conditioning in the room was broken. When we called down to the reception desk, their response \"the windows won't open?\".

In fact, when we arrived our air conditioning wasn't really doing the trick - and the porter came up immediately and fixed it for us! First off, location is fantastic. You honestly could not pick a better location. Our room, # 101, was convenient as we did not have to take the Lift (it fits only 2 people) instead we were able to take the 1 flight of stairs (a plus!) Only negative is that we had a luxurious view of an air conditioning system and alley way. Which normally I would not want, but we were out walking around all day, home to shower and sleep, and that was it! So, I wasn't missing the view. Plus, even the rooms with a view only looked out onto a narrow street with nothing remarkable to look at. Trust me - you're not missing anything if you don't have a view. Plus, if you go to the top floor of the hotel, there is a public outdoor area were there are tables to bring your own wine/food and sit for the night and relax. The room itself was comfortable. Bed was cozy and comfortable. Small office/changing room. Bathroom was large (this is room 101), although it does have a narrow-ish hallway within to get to the toilet and sink. But, this actually makes your room feel larger. Shower had excellent water pressure! There was a flat screen TV, but unless you plan on only watching MTV in Italian overlayed over English speaking people you may not want to turn it on. We listened to a LOT of Italian... which did not help our Italian while we were there though! There is no English channel on the TV, and at first I didn't mind, but once we continued on our travels elsewhere I realized how nice it was to hear your own language when you are in your room! A PLUS... the breakfast bar downstairs. I think I had the best cafe latte's of my life down there! And trust me... I know good coffee! I'm borderline obsessed! Also, they do have an option for breakfast in the morning from 7 - 11 as part of your hotel deal. We did not do this, as the breakfast bar allowed me to get coffee, fresh OJ, and a pastry every morning. This is not a place for a full breakfast of eggs, toasts or even fruit (not really an option anywhere in europe actually). I ended up buying yogurts at local markets and fruit to alternate with the constant pastries being consumed. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel.

I dropped my car off in Rome the day we got there, so I'm not sure what parking arrangements could be made, but I know that street parking in Rome is out of the question. This hotel was very, very nice. Clean, well appointed, with wonderful bathroom and showers. A/C was perfect, and the beds were wonderful, or, we were just tired and slept well. We had a triple executive room. It was ample size with a pull out chair hide a bed for our son, we had plenty of room even with the bed made up.

The room was not spacious (but not many hotels in Rome would be, I suppose!), especially with the rollaway bed, but the room was decorated nicely and was clean... and since I slept in the rollaway bed, I can say it wasn't terrible, although I wouldn't have wanted to sleep in it for more than a couple days. The bathroom seems to have been recently renovated - stylish and clean, but a bit cramped. The hotel staff were average - not rude, but definitely did not go above and beyond to impress us. The hotel has a small cafe/bar attached to the lobby, where we enjoyed a capuccino one afternoon. The best thing about this hotel is its location - just around the corner from the Spanish Steps, close to the metro to get around the city, but also lots to discover on the side streets in the area.

The major problem was that the A/C throughout the hotel was not activated. Thus, I had to sleep with the window open. The nighttime noise was mostly from feral cats carrying on and from a loud TV from an adjoining building; it kept me up most nights. When I complained about the lack of A/C, the manager told me that \"none of the hotels in the area\" had their A/C systems activated due to some governmental regulation about electrical capacity. It sounded like BS. I stopped in at two other hotels in the area and both had working A/C! When I reported this to the hotel mgr, he admitted that \"some of the hotels in the area\" indeed had their systems on. I think the hotel owner was just trying to save on overhead expenses and deliberately misrepresented the hotel on the Web. I could have changed hotels, but didn't want to take a half day out of my typically busy tourist schedule to do that. I just had enough of the sleepless nights, left a day early, and ended up getting one free night as compensation, which in my opinion was totally insufficient.
