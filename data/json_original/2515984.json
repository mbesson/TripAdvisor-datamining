Before the refurbishment, it was fantastic.

Bear in mind this is one of the livelier nightspots in town at the weekend, so don't be surprised to find the hotel lobby full of people having fun as you return on a Saturday night! The cool corner rooms are excellent value, and the furnishings are superbly in tune with the Californian vibe.

I was greeted with TOP NOTCH FIRST CLASS SERVICE. 1) Before I could get out of the taxi cab, someone was there to take my bags. 2) The Front Desk Rep checked me into my room promptly. I was wondering if my previous request to change my room from a double bed to a king size one would be honored. Guess what? I did not have to Wonder or Ask. I was placed in a King Size Deluxe Room on the 29th floor. The room was very CLASSY; contemporary, beautiful, accommodating and relaxing.....my kind of style for sure!!! 3) Before I could walk away from the Front Desk a gentleman with a GREAT PLEASANT smile greeted us with 2 tickets for free cocktails at the Bar. WOW!!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!!! 4) Concierge was very informational regarding entertainment, food and transportation. We used the complimentary ACURA service; this was very thoughtful. We were able to save money spent on a taxi, and used the money instead to give the Acura driver a BIG TIP!!! I'm in the market for a car. The W may have sold me on buying an ACURA. The marketing strategy worked. 4) Oh, YES!!! I loved the Trace Restaurant. The breakfast and dinner were SUPERB!!!! Happy Hour at the BAR was the BUM!!! The room decor and ambiance was just so appropriate. My partner almost missed his flight because we were having such a great time. 5) Overall, my words cannot express how much I loved staying at the W Hotel. My stay was short, but the next time I will plan to stay longer. This was a very romantic trip for my partner and I.

Overall, W is great for the short-stay business traveller. On the flipside, W turns into a party hotel at night which, although energising, is quite hard to get away from if you just require a quiet evening by the bar. However,on the upside, Bliss spa, on the fourth floor provides a welcome haven albeit limited in terms of opening hours.

Why they put anyone so close to one of the construction rooms I have no idea! I Travel often and stayed in many hotels where rooms were being renovated, but I have never experienced this volume of noise! I find it more then unexceptable that any guest would be placed so close to that construction noise. When I complained I was \"upgraded\" to a corner room on the 24th floor. I still had to pack everything up in my room and drag it o a new room. The night prior I had blood stains on the sheets about 1 inch below the bottom of the pillow.. If the maid missed it, she was blind. She also didn't restock my shampoos and conditioners for 2 nights in a row. My first room and my second room both had stray hairs in very visible locations in the bathrooms. I would say the maids have miss interpreted the \"whatever\" slogan incorrectly! The correct responses were given when I complained about the blood stains on the bedding, having run out of shampoo and conditioner, and when I was awoken from the very loud construction. \"I'm very sorry,\" seems to have replaced the, \"Whatever, Whenever\".

It was part of a group discount so the rate was much lower than normal. The W is conveniently located to the convention center and other hotels, so it is ideally situated if you are here for a meeting. It is also close to BART and MUNI so you can get around the city very easily. Also, there are lots of restaurants and shops very close by. Yes, the rooms and lobby are not as vast and expansive as other hotels, but if you are willing to look past that, the rooms are quite comfortable. As mentioned in the other reviews, the decor is chic/modern--this is obviously not a hit with everyone. However, I thought it was a nice change of pace compared to your typical bland colonial hotel room, though it did get a little over the top sometimes, like the keywords that are used to label the kaleidoscope and the color changing Buddha (not kidding, they're in the rooms!). There are all sorts of little perks in the room (most not free!). The built-in desk is great for working on your laptop, with a great office chair and two charging stations, and there's an ipod dock and foot massage mat. The beds are very comfortable. Because the hotel is relatively new, everything is very clean. One thing that is unusual is that there are lots of things in the room that can be used for a charge--much more than other hotels. For example, they have a liquor cabinet (full size bottles), snack cabinet, and other things like shopping bag, bottle of wine, bottled water, that will incur a charge (the fee is always prominently displayed, which is good). So, if you are good at ignoring these things, it's not much of an issue. Also, internet access is not free. Use of the gym is free, and it was nice and well equipped. My interactions with the staff were very positive--everyone was very helpful, and check-in/out was very efficient.

Instead the decor at the W was dark and more 1990's black with hits of primary colours. Certainly not what I expected for a trendy hotel, but certainly not a deal breaker either. Decor aside, the check-in was fast and efficient. The decor of the rooms was much nicer and brighter. However, I was disappointed by the size of the beds. I have stayed at other Westins in the past and have always looked forward to their \"heavenly\" beds. This time the bed, which felt a tad smaller than a double, was far too small for two adults and my husband and I both woke up with knots in our backs. As well, the walls between the rooms were quite thin as I could hear the conversations of my neighbours as well as their music quite clearly. Fortunately, they went to bed around 1 am so I did not complain to the front desk. The fitness room is quite well equipped and the pool is a nice size.

Luckily, they had a standard room available at $179 but it was for double beds. I called the Starwood hotline asking for a king bed and actually ended up reserving a 'cool' corner room for $40 more with their AAA rate. I've stayed at this W in SF and New York and knew what to expect: a really hip hotell. Our room was just as described, cool. It was on the 12th floor with views of the Moma.

I really was kicking myself and wished that we stayed Friday night as well. My fiance loved our room; it was his first time staying at W. The area is convenient. We walked to Union Square on Sunday afternoon and as mentioned we had reservations at Benu on Saturday night. The two things that we did not like: 1) the wall was thin; we could hear the room next to us partying. We didn't mind as they were having fun but it was a Valentine weekend getaway. 2) Parking rate at the hotel was expensive. We found street parking near the restaurant and it worked out that Sunday is free street parking day in the city (most neighborhoods). We had a drink at the bar after dinner. It was definitely hip, crowd. We stayed for one drink as it was 1 am and everyone else in the bar/lounge area was pretty much drunk, except us.

The staff has been extra attentive, always friendly and really sensitive to every small request / detail. During my rather long stay I contacted both Whenever/Whatever and the front desk numerous times and constantly got very helpful reply, real interest in helping me and very friendly stuff.

The room was large and had truly wonderful views of the city (see the pictures). Also, the staff was generally helpful throughout our stay including the next morning when my girlfriend was suffering from an upset stomach. We partook of room service the next day for lunch and the quality was above average for American hotels but certainly not at the same level as the Mandarin in San Francisco or other \"5-star\" locations. The service staff was a bit intrusive, especially the cleaning lady who kept insisting on coming in despite the fact that we had arranged for a late checkout. The lobby/entrance of the W in San Francisco, like all W's, doubles as the main bar. It was a Thursday evening so the crowd was a bit older and not very heavy which was perfectly fine for 2 severely jet lagged guests. I would say that the San Francisco lobby is not quite as stylish or clubby as the W in Chicago by comparison. It was also overrun by a group of extremely drunk folks from Ireland who were friendly enough but seemed to have trouble avoiding other people. Location-wise the W hotel is ideally situated for people looking to shop (say at the Westfield Mall) in the Union Square area. Certainly, its closer than other hotels like the Mandarin and 4 Seasons which are located in the heart of the business district. As a result, the guests tend to be more along the tourist lines and the hotel clearly caters to them (with only perfunctory business services and amenities) - that may be something other people need to factor in.

Instead of telling me where the drug store was, he asked what I needed. I showed him my list, he reviewed it, and said \"yes, I have this; yes, I can take care of this; and yes, I think I have this in my first aid kit.\" He inquired how my girlfriend (name redacted for review) was feeling, what he could to assist, and said, \"here at the W we take care of our guests. In which room are you staying? I'll have my staff deliver your request immediately, I'll alert them to be on the lookout for any additional needs you may have, and allow us to attend to the bill.\" Less than fifteen minutes later, F&B Dir. knocked, directed his colleague to place the beautifully arranged tray (cf. attached) on the table, and again asked after my girlfriend (name redacted). There are and were no words to express my appreciation. While there are many who talk about service, and even a few make a valiant effort, fewer still go beyond that extra step to not merely answer the question rather to understand the true need. F&B Dir. did that, and more. Please pass along my deep gratitude for his kindness and generosity. Please know how deeply touched I was by his action, the server's room service delivery, and your kitchen's presentation.

The W theme gets old fast, but that's a minor detail. Example - instead of garage they call it Wheels. The button on the phone reads Whatever, Whenever. You get the idea. I was put off when the check-in agent asked if I would like to forego maid service in exchange for having some nominal number of points deposited into my Starwood account. This is ostensibly an environmental initiative, but to me it smacked of cost-cutting at the staff level. Given that California has a 12% unemployment rate, I don't want to be responsible for a hotel maid losing her job, especially at the corporate rate of $319 a night for a regular room. Decor is West Elm meets Anthropologie. Cute little light-up Buddha in the bedroom, nice windowseat, well thought-out built-in desk with lots of compartments, funky headboard, decent bed. Bathroom has glass door, which is a trend I abhor, though I was traveling alone at least. The glass is frosted but still - not enough privacy when traveling with someone else, at least to me.

Later, when we checked our bill, we had a $48 charge on it for a bottle that was supposed to be in the room when we checked in.

I decided to stay at the W on this trip back for a friend's wedding. The W has retained its modern and cool feel, however it does have some draw backs. First the check in area is quite small and can get congested. I know the decor is supposed to be contemporary, but it's a bit too black and dark. Also at least on this trip, they pumped the dance music a bit too loud in the lobby/check-in area. I think it's primarily because of Oracle World this week... but still, the music volume is a bit much. Although others have mentioned security at the hotel entrance, the elevators do require a guest card to access it. The rooms decorated with modern furniture and do feel \"cool\", however they are a bit on the cramped side. The property is showing a little bit of age, but the room that I stayed in is clean (King bed). The rates were a bit expensive relative to what you get (I had to pay +$600 for corporate), however I think it's because of the Oracle World conference. The bed sheets could be a little more comfortable for what your paying, but they're acceptable. The +30\" LCD TV is acceptable for the room size and the entertainment selection is very good (on demand movies, all high def cable, etc). The work area in the room is great for business travelers. The desk has 6 power outlets within easy reach, a dedicated ethernet cable and of course wifi (if you pay for a day, you can connect up to 3 devices). I would say the direct ethernet connection is better vs. wifi...as I found the wifi performance a bit spotty. If you're a Starwood Gold member, you get a free Fiji bottled water with the room. Room service is good and the services is pretty fast. The breakfast I had was excellent. The location of the hotel isn't bad if you're spending time downtown or in SOMA. You're pretty much within walking distance of shopping, food and major public transit. If you're looking for a high end place that is modern to stay in the same general area, I'd recommend the St. Regis or the Intercontinental over the W.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay at this hotel\u201d", "Author": "naomifl73", "ReviewID": "UR118671312", "Content": "My husband and I love W hotels and have stayed at several locations across the country.

Maybe I should tell you that the W hotel San Francisco used to be one of my favorite hotels in the city. The rooms were stylish, sexy, comfortable and the public areas were lively, clean and attractive. Not anymore. It\u2019s a design disaster! The second thing you should know is that the hotel is undergoing major renovation \u2013 major. A fact that we were never informed of at any part of our reservation process. There is no lobby and the makeshift check in area is truly deplorable. There are work lights, tarps, paint and pathetic \u201coops\u201d signs everywhere \u2013 letting you know that acknowledged that problem. Maybe they could tell you about the problem before you book the hotel. If the lobby wasn\u2019t enough reason not to stay here \u2013 the remodeled guest rooms definitely are. The rooms are now a disaster of crappy furniture, white walls, tan carpet and broken plastic Buddha\u2019s. As a designer myself, I have fallen in love with many W Hotels\u2019 designs in the past\u2014I understand and appreciate good design. This is not good design. The room looks like someone made a last minute dash to a Japanese version of IKEA and slapped crap on the walls, put together cheap furniture and left before it was finished. The room d\u00e9cor is a disaster. It is also pathetic to see remnants of the old d\u00e9cor still pathetically left behind: a dark wood headboard, a sink, a mirror, drapery tracks on the ceiling without drapes. None of it works. It\u2019s hard to choose the worst element in the room. The freeform mirror glued onto the old headboard? The plastic Japanese \u201cart\u201d pathetically installed on the wall? Or maybe the random lamp balancing on the edge of the desk that obviously didn\u2019t fit into its nook? The new disastrous design also makes its way into the W restaurant Trace. Before I tell you about the restaurant, let me say the staff at the restaurant was excellent and the cuisine was very good. The restaurant is also a design disaster. If the challenge was to take a great space and break it into 17 cramped and uncomfortable areas\u2014mission accomplished! The cheap looking d\u00e9cor looks like it came from the same Japanese IKEA and someone has the novel idea of making black wood cages in which to place the tables. Even the waiters complain about navigating the maze of cramped tables and black wood crates. There is also a \u201cdot\u201d pattern on the wall and windows, a theme that permeates the new areas, and it is annoying, tedious and already dated. Whew!

The sliding bathroom door with no way to secure it made me very uncomfortable and lacked privacy.

To start with the building works; the hotel really should have closed during the reconstruction as there is absolutely no lobby or bar space and it feels more like a low costs lodging room building - but at $300 a night rather that $30. Short-term just don't stay here, long-term this decision to stay open is going to hurt the W's reputation a lot. Even if the building was in perfect nick, the pretentiousness would still be truly gag-inducing. Ask for bell-boy to bring a coffee machine to your room (shouldn't they be there anywhere in a a 5*?) and reception will announce that they are sending up their \"room stylist\". There is a lot of \"sending up\" going on at this hotel but mainly of the guests. Reception desks are labelled \"Whenever\" and \"Whatever\" while the door guys wear T-shirts asking\"What Next?\". When Apple does this in its stores it is somehow ironic wit. When the W does it it comes across as a crass attempt at being cool that is actually just irritating. But nothing beyond the superficiality of slogans and a rather noisy air conditioning system supports the hotels supposed chilled status. The rooms are OK, but little more. The location is all right, but then so are the St. Regis, the Westin and the Four Seasons. My final gripe is the ease with which you can spot the reviews on tripadvisor that have clearly been written by the hotel's staff or its PR agency. Take a look, they are quite easy to spot (they start with something that established credentials - \"staying here on a business trip\" for example, then heap praise on location, facilities and comfort and end with a round of applause for the wonderful staff).

The W San Francisco hotel has some construction taking place on the ground floor. However I believe it is completed at the end of September.

Not a major remodel. Does not affect rooms or noise, in my experience. Check in : Very quick and friendly, however there was no :\"preferred\" line for SPG members. It was very busy, but the staff was moving as fast as they could. Room: This is my 3rd stay at this hotel. Room is on the smaller side, but very cheery. soothing walls with added pops of color, art, and accessories. Accessories need to be noted as they are things like little lamps, a Budha nightlight (that changes color) books. staggerd shelving, vases. I had a corner room and the corner couches had decorative pillows with a round coffee table. It made for a nice sitting area and overlooked the city. Windows have nice wide shutters. Location: Located 2 block South of Market Street. A less than 10 minute will have you enjoying great shopping, or easy access to the BART system. Room Service: Food was excellent. Ordered what was recommended. Local salmon cooked to perfection, one of the best I have had. Arrived in less than 30 minutes, with a smile. Bath: Large Bathroom with a tub/shower combo. Lots of vanity space and shelving to hold extras. Robes provided and plenty of towels. Bath line is from \"Bliss\". What I find interesting is that you can go shopping without leaving your room. Room is stocked with items for sale such as wine by the bottle, hats, robes, Ipod docks, candy, nuts, chips, first aid kit, tote bags, and items for \"adult safe encounters\".

I called down to have the shirt cleaned and a new ironing board sent up. When I returned to the room, the shirt was gone to the cleaners but no new iron / board.

Really, who wants to get dressed and put on shoes to go fetch their own coffee in the bustling lobby? And I don't particularly like opening the door to room service in my PJS.** We paid a little over $250 a night for a double room with a high floor city view. We were traveling as a family with our 13 and 1 year old daughters for 2 nights. We are from the South Bay, wanting just a couple of nights in the city to celebrate our 13 year old's birthday. She chose the W based on the modern & whimsical decor. It was our first stay. W Wheels: We drove into the city in our car. The turn off for valet was a sharp turn down a narrow covered alley. We had to lap the block because we missed it the first time, no big deal. Valet were helpful and polite. Parking is expensive, I think I overheard $48/day with in-out privileges. This makes one cringe, but it is standard in an old/crowded city like SF and we knew it would be a hefty fee to park the car. The Lobby was under construction during our stay so it was very cramped, but again, we knew that in advanced from the hotel website. It wasn't an issue and although our stay was over the weekend, we never heard any disruption evident of ongoing construction. Staff at the front desk was efficient and courteous. We did not utilize the car service, bell service, concierge, fitness, spa, or room service during our stay. Oh wait, I *did* use the fitness room - I refilled my water bottle from the cooler there. Why? Because the FIJI in the room was $6 for a teeny bottle. Go to one of the many many many Walgreen's within walking distance and buy your own water bottle(s)! Previous reviewers noted that the key-card elevator was complicated, but we didn't find this to be a problem (at least worth mentioning). (Weird, but given the clubby feeling to the downstairs, I can see them wanting to deter too many non-guests from the upper floors.) However, they'll just clomp up and down the metal stairwell (see below). The room decor at the hotel is light and airy, the view was great. The condition was fairly clean, good condition, minor wear and tear. My husband who travels for business felt that the desk area had a bit too much clutter for his taste, I thought it was cute and it had a lot of plugs. I was more concerned about the idea of a community wooden foot massage under the desk...maybe ok for home, but at a hotel? No thanks! But moreso, it prevented the desk chair from being pushed in all the way and the room is a bit tight on space! Lots of good adjustable lighting in the room, very bright, or soft and dim. The lava lamp buddha was noted as \"cool\" by my 13 year old and husband. (Same husband who felt the little organized paperclip, notepaper and pencil holder on the desk was cluttered, actually LIKED the bright glowing Buddha that prevented the baby from going to sleep, lol!) Beds were comfortable with a feather top and nice sheets and pillows. I do my typical \"bedbug\" check whenever I get to a hotel and pull up everything. Let's just say that housekeeping doesn't check the mattresses very well - could've used a good vacuum. Lots of feathers from the feather bed, some random hairs (eek), a few crumbs, and on one bed, a yellowish stain - leaky diaper, I imagine (hope). The feather bed topper and the linens were all crisp and spotless. And I supposed the feather bed was a decent barrier from said stain... Behind the headboard, they could use more attention with the vacuum - lots of dust and feathers back there where the vacuum can't reach. Great choice of carpet color/texture - no visible stains. I know hotel rooms are dirty from use, but it makes me feel better if I can't SEE any actual stains, even if they're there. :) Small room, but I don't do jumping jacks in my hotel room, so it was ok. We even had an umbrella stroller sitting in the room by the window and it was fine. 4 people in the room had plenty of space. Average room size for SF. Bathroom decent size as well. The window seat was comfortable. The cushion had some signs of wear and tear, the walls had some nicks from people being careless with the shutters, but the view was great - what stains? What gouges in the drywall? View made up for it. Comfortable enough to fall asleep on! The closet was fine, kind of tight on space, but doable. I never use the hotel bathrobes, but there were two. Slippers would have been awesome...or even flip flops! How hip would that be, W? Purple flip flops? SUPER cheap way to impress guests. The bathroom - I really like the light blue walls and the glass surface. The toiletries were plentiful and I particularly appreciated the face wash. I often forget mine at home and hotels rarely offer this! The shower/tub combo had the curved curtain which seems to be the standard now. The toilet paper seemed to be awfully far from the toilet, but I'm short and I guess my arms are as well. The roll had the annoying metal flap on it, too. Toilet paper needs a mudguard like a 4x4? I didn't like it. For a double room, I could have used more towels initially (4 of each), however, housekeeping did a very good job. They came while we were out (not too early, not to late) and did a great job refreshing the room. Linens were changed, toiletries were restocked, towels were replaced and everything was dusted and vacuumed. It is always pleasant to come back from a long afternoon to a fresh room. Worth not getting the $5 credit. I also like that if connected rooms are requested, rather than a door in a wall, they have the outer door to connect the rooms. So if you book two rooms together for a family, you almost have a little (dark) foyer. The not-so-perfect: we were located near the stairwell and it got SUPER noisy very late at night. Stairs in a hotel are bad enough, but we're talking about the W and that means herds of girls wearing high heels clomping down metal stairs. As each herd trundled down, it sounded like steel drums...we were watching a movie with the volume pretty high and the noise in the stair well was so loud and startling, it took a moment to register the cause of the noise! The walls are also very thin so it is quite noisy. There were some hooting and hollering guests in the distance. It didn't last particularly long (maybe someone complained) but it was pretty loud and let's face it, it's a hip party hotel for special occasions - parties, etc. We knew this going in, so we were ok with it. However, if you like a nice sleep and are a weary business person or a couple looking for a romantic trip - this might not be the hotel for you. If you are a family and you and the kidlets can't stay up past 8pm, this might not be the hotel for you. Families and peace & quiet seekers, be forewarned. It's like: don't go to Disneyland if you don't like kids. Don't come to the W San Francisco if you're a curmudgeon. So yes, I'd probably stay here again if traveling with my family. Nothing really pulled me in enough to say, \"OMG I'll always stay here every time I come to SF,\" but if the rate is reasonable and it's the best option, I'd do it. There was nothing unpleasant about the stay, it just didn't WoW me. I'd say about average; not the best, not the worst. If I were to travel without kids, as a couple, I wouldn't stay here. I'd pay a bit extra and opt for the St. Regis (around the corner, also a Starwood property) or the Four Seasons to feel really relax and enjoy. And yes, my coffee maker came as requested and promptly. The front desk made sure to follow up just to be sure it arrived on time. :)", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "tgrame", "ReviewID": "UR114842683", "Content": "Great location for the Bay to Breakers.

Also, just a note to those thinking of visiting San Francisco. The city seems to have a major problem with homelessness and drug addicts. Living in London this is something we are use to seeing but nowhere near the level that we saw in San Fran. The locals seem to ignore them which was just really sad.

A coffee maker in a room is standard in the US and, although you probably want guests to linger in the lobby and purchase expensive drinks there, its not cool to have to request to have one put in the room......and to wait for 6hrs to actually get it.....and to not have the coffee packs refilled the next day. Thirdly, the cleaning staff were forever opening and closing doors all day along our floor thus disrupting my sleep (I was not on SF time zone as would be most guests). Could you ask them please to wedge the doors open when entering a room to clean it as it was annoying to get some rest anytime between 8am and 8pm.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Felton, California", "Title": "\u201cI LOVE THIS PLACE\u201d", "Author": "stipefreak", "ReviewID": "UR98733014", "Content": "This is a very upscale elegant hotel.

The W in SF is extremely stylish - very unique and very different from what you are used to from the large hotel chains which all remsemble themselves so much that it does not really make a difference where you stay. The W has more of a european style, bright pastel colors and lights in the rooms simplicity and yet a lot of nice details like a lit buddha. The have a great bench by the windows with a perfect view of SF. The amendities are samples of the BLISS Spa products and a I only used the face wash (the first time I got that in a hotel) and the liquid sopa but they were great. The lobby is darker, with a turntable for lounge nights and psycadelic wall pictures. Valet parking is available with very nice staff ( they gave us water bottles for the drive home). Pretty pricey with $48 plus tax per night, but parking in SF is always quite a pain. This place probably does not appeal too much conservative travelers who enjoy the dark wood and fabric style, but it is ideal for those who want their eyes spoilt and like something special. A few minor thins that could be improved: We had reserved for two but there was only one bathrobe. Just a detail but one that should be taken care of. Also, our rooms have not been cleaned when we returned around 3:30pm and I called the lobby and asked them to send someone after 8 since we wanted to take a nap. 30mins later we had the roommaid knock on our doors, of course while we were sleeping.

I LOVE this hotel. From the moment we enter the valet, we feel pampered. It seems that the W, a Starwood property, has thought of everything. Let me count the ways... The valet - though we often drive up in a gigantic Ford F550, dually, dump truck totally covered in mud, the valet is always accommodating -- more than accommodating, actually. Our truck in the W valet is a hilarious sight, and I love that they welcome us so heartily. The front desk - We've stayed at the W at least 10 times over the years. We have only had great experiences checking in and out. One morning we were leaving to catch a flight before anything (Starbucks, Pete's - anything) opened, and the woman that checked us out went out of her way to get my husband coffee and tea for me. What service! The room - We usually stay in a corner suite. I love these rooms. The bathrooms are very well lit -- perfect for putting on makeup (this is something that's often overlooked by other hotels). The products are wonderful, and include not just shampoo and soap, but also wonderful conditioner and the BEST lotion. The bathtub is deep -- perfect for a relaxing soak. I sleep astoundingly well in the W beds. I love that the duvets are crisp and white and the pillows are squishy and down. The W rooms feel clean, fresh and new. This is a small thing, but my husband and I don't have a TV at home, and both of us really enjoy watching HGTV and the Food Network when we go to a hotel. The last three, very wonderful hotels that we've stayed in have not had those channels. The W does. The restaurant - I've mostly eaten breakfast at the W. I've only had good meals there, and I believe everything they serve is organic, which I appreciate. The bar/scene - The W bar scene is hip and fun. If you're up for it, the bar is generally going off most nights. You can hang at the tables in the bar, upstairs or on the couches off to the side. On the weekends they have a DJ, and it gets pretty riotous. Fun! Pets - My husband and I had to pick up our new dog at the SF airport, and stayed at the W that night. A dog bed, organic dog treats and food bowls were waiting for us on our arrival. Finally, the W uses all eco-friendly cleaners and detergents. Another small, but significant detail.

Room service, in room movies and a lot of sleep. The W changed my entire impression of the city and Starwood Hotels. From the time of arrival and our short 3 nights in the hotel it was nothing short of a perfect stay. Everyone from the doorman, to the room service attendant was courteous, punctual, and went above and beyond the call of duty. The W's tag line, whatever, whenever truly holds true at this hotel. They continually did everything in their power to make me feel like royalty. Maybe they knew ahead of time that I was not a big fan? I don't know what it was but the managerial team should be commended on their leadership. I learned a long time ago that people and customer service are never perfect, but when things go wrong, how does the service provider recover from the mis-hap? That everyone, is a true sign of a good General Manager, Department Manager, and training. On one occasion, I specifically asked for Tabasco with our morning breakfast. The room service attendant came upstairs, politely set the table and as I was signing the check I asked him where the hot sauce was. He immediately apologized, and left to retrieve the sauce. That would have been enough, but upon his return he also brought us a very large bottle of Fiji water. What a great surprise. He must of seen the thirst in our eyes. This small gesture was only the first of many great experiences with the staff. Also take advantage of their free Acura MDX service.

We'd been travelling around California and this was the last hotel we stayed at before flying home. I paid nearly $400 a night for a 3 night stay in a 'Fabulous' corner room, and I felt a bit ripped off. The hotel markets itself as a boutique type hotel with a cool vibe, but to us it came across as snobby and unwelcoming. We're a professional couple in our 30's and we love to travel, which I would think is the target market for the W and we've stayed at several before, so it's not like we just 'don't get it', but we feel that at the end of the day the W staff are in the hospitality industry and the coolest thing they can do is to look after their guests well and at this W they really don't. Pros: 1. The porters were great and out of all the staff these guys were really helpful, and the only ones who seemed to care about the guest experience. 2. The location is great for SFMOMA and Market St/Union Sq restaurants, bars, sightseeing, and shopping. Cons: 1. The front desk staff were really snooty, uninterested and unhelpful. 2. The hotel charges premium prices for *everything* on top of the already fairly high room rates. 3. The 'fabulous' room is just OK. OK view, OK size, adequate sound proofing, decent bed. Hardly 'Fabulous' and personally i found the quirky room decor more than a little garish and tacky. 4. The area seems to be a homeless hot-spot, and there were usually several people begging right outside the hotel every time we went out or came back. It seems the numbers of homeless people increases every time we go back to San Francisco, especially in the Market St/Union Square area, and seeing people who are clearly mentally ill, disabled and/or old living on the streets and rifling through bins is something we can never get used to (Not the W's fault of course, but as it's rife in the area then it'd be remiss not to mention it). 5. The concierge was constantly busy, and when I did wait long enough to get to speak to her it felt like I was an irritating distraction for her.

These may be small items, but my expectations are high and these small items should not occur at a W property. 1. Check in. The person assigning me my room made it a point to let me know I she gave me an upgrade. I asked her what that was\u2026she said she put me on a higher floor. Well, for one, I am a Starwood member and am automatically placed on a higher floor and second my co worker who is not a member was put on this same floor just as a matter of assigning her room. Just put me in a room, but don\u2019t tell me I am getting some kind of special upgrade when really, I am not. 2. Bath amenities. My co worker received makeup removal cloths each day, I never received any. If I have a sink and a bath, I appreciate 2 bars of soap so I am not moving them back and forth. To only get 1 bar, and then the next day not be given another for the tub is not appropriate. Additionally, on one of the days when my room was made up, they did not give me any washcloths! None. Now yes I can call housekeeping, but at 6 am I should not have to wait to get in the shower, potentially causing me to be late to my meeting, in order to wait for housekeeping to bring me washcloths and then provide a tip as well. 3. Desk outlets. The outlets on the right side of the desk were dead. When charging laptops, cell phones, etc. it was inconvenient to only have the 2 outlets on the left side of the desk working. 4. Bed, sitting on the edge of the bed the mattress coils stuck out, and the mattress was definitely compressed on the side nearest the window . I would say if the mattress is that old, it should be replaced. 5. Coffee\u2026 boy. On the morning of the no washcloth situation (already in a bad mood) I went downstairs to get a cup of coffee.. .this is about 6:30 am. The coffee had been set in the lounge area the previous 2 days. I went there only to see no coffee, so I trek to the check in area, a gentleman there is draining the very last of the coffee there\u2026.arrgh. I really need some coffee. Finally find someone only to learn that the coffee is now kept around the corner in the dining room, its only in the bar on busy mornings. I suspect if you are not going to offer in room coffee you can at least make it clear to guests where they can find some without searching for 10 minutes or changing the coffee location based on criteria that I am not privy to. 6. I am supposed to get the paper at my door each morning. Did not, so spoke to the front desk and that was rectified. But I was told on check in that I would be getting the paper, I shouldn\u2019t have had to ask a second time. I will say the Acura car is nice to have, and that worked out well for us.

I'd describe it as casual/chic. Really comfortable seating in the \"Living Room\", good DJ on the weekends in the bar area, good food, great mixed cocktails. Used the Acura Experience to get to some of the local attractions. Had the same driver 3 times - Phil - and he was a fountain of knowledge and gave us lots of tips about places to eat, things to see, etc. Front desk staff so nice - the names that stand out in my mind are Sophia and Ceasar, but really everyone was very nice, always had a welcoming smile. The doorman Dustin was really great - we had a problem with one of the tour operators that we booked through the hotel - he had the concierge follow-up and sent us a \"little something\" to the room with a very nice note. (He did this all of his own accord, and followed up with us the next time he saw us.) The hotel had little touches which meant a lot - like complementary coffee in the am, water or light lemonade in the afternoon/evenings, apples everywhere for you to munch on, and biscotti in the morning and cookies in the evening. Sometimes there was fresh fruit or nuts. The rooms were nice, small but expected for a city hotel. Loved the bathroom, lots of light, liked the cube seating and the amenities were really excellent. The room, as I said, was very small but the view made up for it - we were room 2307, had a great view of the Bay Bridge. If I had to pick one negative, it would be the lighting in the room - it was very poor. I am a reader, love to read at night for 20 minutes or so before I go to bed and with every light on in the room, it was pretty dim. But I guess those rooms are not made for the studious reader sort, given the chic reputation of the hotel. Used the gym, thought about using the pool but didn't (it was a very cold 5 days, highs were in the 50s so I didn't feel like swimming.) Gym was more than adequate for my needs, used it 3 times. Almost used the spa but they didn't have availability when I wanted it - and I asked at the last minute so that was my fault. However, it looked nice and smelled wonderful. Oh that is another thing, the smell in the hotel was great! They had fragrance sticks in the elevators but it wasn't overpowering, just added to the overall atmosphere.

The location is really ideal for conferences at the Moscone Center, but also for people in-town just for sight seeing. We were able to walk to the BART ($8.10 and 30 minutes to get to the hotel from the airport on it), cable cars, buses, etc and also used the free Acura car service for a ride to brunch in the Mission. People said the area shuts down on weekends, but we found MANY places open to eat/drink at over the weekend within a few minutes walk.....and you MUST check out Samovar, a great place to eat, have tea, and relax at across the street at Yerba Buena Gardens. I'm in love....such a great little spot. We had a corner king room on the 16th floor. The views are OK, not breath-taking. The room was a comfortable size and the furniture was not nearly as IKEA-like and cheap looking as the photos make it look. The little \"window seats\" were great for relaxing and reading on. The bathroom is nothing special and personally, the shower could use some more pressure, but the Bliss products were a nice treat. My 1st day, the hot water went out, but it was fixed very quickly. There's not really a dresser to put away clothing in either, but there are some window ledges that can work as shelves. Our room was full of natural light which we loved (although the shutters didn't really seal the light out if you want to sleep in either) The gym is small, but very clean and modern. It's attached to a small pool/spa which is indoors, but has tons of natural light. We relaxed down there a few times. The spa jets were not working one day, but they quickly fixed it. Had a oxygen facial with Kim in the spa and it was divine. My skin looked fab!! The spa is really not a place to hang out at, but the treatments are good & they give you little snacks which is a nice touch. Room service was prompt, but the food was nothing to write home about (except the plate of cookies....those were GOOD). We spent a lot of time meeting with clients in the hotel lobby bar which always seems to be hopping. A nice, mixed crowd, but an overall very trendy and cool vibe. A nice place to hang out and free wifi in the lobby is an added bonus. Drinks are pricey, but tasty. I wasn't all that impressed with the bartenders....they seemed a bit spacey and not on top of their game (which they should be for $12+ cocktails darn it). Service was good and staff are friendly & polite. They have a little computer in the lobby to print airline boarding passes from and also let us have a 4pm check-out without any cost which was GREATLY appreciated. Overall, we enjoyed our stay & would stay again. Although the place is not 5 star luxury, it has many pluses and the hip and trendy vibe worked well for us (early 30s professional couple).", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redwood City", "Title": "\u201cLots to love at the W\u201d", "Author": "LasMuchachas", "ReviewID": "UR67299980", "Content": "We were allowed to check in at 11 am without hesitation and then we learned that they have an \"Acura Concierge\" where they can drive you to a nearby location.

I later found out that this was Alex, the \"manager on duty.\" He said that since the hotel didn't have any rooms comparable to mine to move me to and that the only ones are on a low floor with 2 twin beds or handicap rooms. Yet, again, another employee with non-genuine automatic responses. I could tell he was phrasing his responses in a way to get me back up to my room so he could move on to someone else.

But that is the price of being in a place everyone wants to be. The great news is that once you are there, the staff really finds a way to care and deliver quality. I was extremely impressed with the personal effort being expended by so many of the team members at this property. The rooms were very comfortable (some with great views) and I had a really memorable stay - the phrase 'whenever, wherever' is true. They make it happen here - no matter what you need - even at 3 in the morning. Amazing food quality at room service. And fast. Wow. This is all about staff effort. On the negative side (nothing to do with the SF property) I don't like the W policy about charging an arm and a leg for internet service in the business center. This is just too greedy and reminds me that I'm in a major city where a company is out to make a buck - and it is a jarring jolt from the oasis that is the rest of the W experience.

Acknowledged my advanced request for a quiet room. Even better, they delivered one. Room: Clean and comfortable. Great room d\u00e9cor, as expected from a W. Window seat is a nice touch, but you can\u2019t sit in it with the shutters open. Shutters on the windows seem a strange choice to me. They did fine blocking most of the light. There is also a sheer curtain, so you could have the shutters open for light and still have some privacy. The desk was groovy and well appointed with Ethernet and six outlets. It\u2019s not the most ergonomic workspace, so probably not the best choice for someone working in the room for long hours. The room was big enough for two, but would be cramped if you tried to fit a family of four into a double. Lighting was a bit skimpy. If I was in the room during the day, I opened the shutters for more light. Noise: Hallway noise was fairly typical for a hotel: you hear door slams and people in the hall. I heard almost no street noise\u2014quite impressive for a downtown hotel in a major city\u2014from my room facing towards the Bay Bridge. However, you should note that the south side of the hotel is next to a firehouse. I\u2019m guessing rooms on that side will hear the sirens. I could hear toilet flushing/showers, and muffled TV from the room above, but did not notice any footfall or conversation noise. Bed: Quite comfortable. They provide a generous 4 pillows per double bed. Location: ideal for conventions at the Moscone Center. This was one of my primary considerations. It\u2019s also an easy walk to BART and the shopping district at Market St. Restaurants and a movie theater are also quite close. Sustainability: I took the no-maid-service option at checking. I don\u2019t need my sheets and towels changed every day and I didn\u2019t figure I\u2019d generate much trash either. I have found that at hotels that say they don\u2019t change and wash your towels everyday upon request, they actually do. Security: elevators require a key card to ascend above the 5th floor. Food: Pricey, but in line with this class of downtown hotel. Breakfast was better than I expected. Dinner was just OK. Technology: In-room internet was $16/day. Not cheap. If you want internet access included with your room, go to a hotel that offers it. I\u2019m certainly not going to complain about a charge that I knew to expect. Nice HDTV with actual HD content. The clock radio is a stylish Tivoli and had an ipod dock connected. It struck me as impractical to go with the high style radio then cobble on a dock that either has to sit on top of the radio\u2019s speaker or take up more of the limited bedside space. Parking: I didn\u2019t park at the hotel. It\u2019s an easy walk from BART. Service: Employees were eager to help. Late on the second day, water started to gurgle up through the shower drain. I called it in and was told engineering would be up to fix it. However, they quickly called back and offered to move me to another room (on a higher floor) and comp me a breakfast. Unfortunately that floor had a group that was up all night moving from room to room. The next morning, I asked to be moved again and was given another room. It was inconvenient to have to move, but they were clearly concerned about my comfort and safety. Spa: I did indulge in a massage my last night there. Facilities were quite good, especially for a downtown hotel (as opposed to a rural, desert location). My therepist, Angeles, was great. One of the best massages I\u2019ve had. Overall I was very pleased. I was worried based on some of the complaints I had read.

I was denied check in because the room was under my husband's name. I told them that I will give them my credit card to guarantee the room and showed them my ID that had the same last name with my husband. They still denied me check in stating that the name of the reservation has to exactly match the id of the person checking in. After arguing back and forth they finally changed the check in under my name and took my card saying...\"but your husband cant check in when he comes'. Why would he have to check in again ?. I'm checking in now and I can leave the key for him. She did not reply. This whole check in fiasco also happened to a bunch of my friends who were also traveling separately from their husbands. you can imagine the hustle. this ruined the entire experience for me from the start. I stayed in a suite that cost almost 1100 dollars a night. it was huge but had really plain furniture with holes in them. Somebody must have left a cigarette burning I guess. It took me an hour to ask for a shower cap and even in a 1000 dollar suite, they did not supply any free fiji waters and charge 6 dollars for each. When a friend of mine lost her key, it took forever to get a replacement because she was sharing the room with another friend and the reservation was under her name. they would not allow her into the room until the other friend came back to show her ID. When my husband forgot some money on the table after check out it took forever to get back into the room. He had to be escorted by a security guard who kept asking him for his id.

I went to the front desk and requested them, they stated that they don't have movies anymore because no one returned them.

Once a trendsetter in popularizing boutique hotels, W is now on the tamer side of progressiveness, but don\u2019t tell that to the mob in the lobby. While some hotels are conceived as a home away from home, I think of the W as a nightclub with beds upstairs. From the moment you walk in (and regardless of the hour) you\u2019re enveloped by the thump-thump-thumping of music, an organic lounge seating area that begs you to check out who\u2019s who, and no shortage of hipsters who collectively turn and check you out as you pass through the door and then dismissively return to their small talk. You don\u2019t get that at the Westin across the street. In San Francisco, the W will always be relevant because of its location. I stayed there because it was directly across from Moscone, and for a convention there\u2019s simply no better place. The dichotomy between badge-wearing conventioneers and twentysomethings is a little awkward, but it makes for interesting social mixing. If you\u2019re going boutique, I\u2019d put the W SF several rungs below the Hudson in NY or Delano in Miami Beach or any of their brethren. It remains more homey, however, than the stark modernism of the new St. Regis next door or Intercontinental one block down. The room worked for me. Smallish (no surprise), it was more residential and quirky than I expected. I liked the playful accessories \u2013 the foot massager under the desk (every hotel should have one), the glowing Buddha, the kaleidoscope, the bench running the width of the room along the window with the block of wood as a step, the wealth of stationery and things with clever phrases on them. The bathroom was fine \u2013 I like the Bliss products \u2013 tangy without being silly. The bed was heavenly as expected. On the other hand, the plantation shutters make absolutely no sense in a city hotel \u2013 you\u2019re stuck with them blocking your view in the middle of the window if you open them, they don\u2019t black out the light, and they\u2019re a pain if you\u2019re sitting on the bench presumably trying to look out the window at the fantastic skyline. The clock radio was too cool for its own good \u2013 I prefer digital clocks with the correct time that I can read in the dark instead of a 50\u2019s style form-follows-form piece. The room was too dark and turning the lights on (and the Buddha off) required more reconnaissance than necessary. And finally, the $14.95 for internet access in Downtown San Francisco is frankly insulting to Steve Jobs and everyone else who made Silicon Valley what it is - even a B&B in Vermont gives it to you for free these days. Guys, charge another buck at the bar if you have to. Downstairs, the food was good in the restaurant and the prices reasonable, the fitness center serviceable, the pool a welcomed surprise and their kiosk to print out boarding passes very handy. The service was fine, nothing exceeded my expectations but no disappointments either. The free Acura shuttle was perhaps the most memorable part of my stay, they swept me away to an outstanding Greek restaurant for dinner - Kokkari Estiatorio \u2013 splendid lamb chops. My one recommendation to W is to change up the music in the morning so that it doesn\u2019t feel like I have a hangover in Vegas when I\u2019m coming down in the elevator.

They don't seem able to muster their pleasant and agreeable service. The front desk staff acted disheartened to see me, or maybe anyone, when I arrived to check in. I went downstairs to the lobby on my first morning and the front desk staff (a different one) seemed annoyed and diffident when I asked where I could get a cup of coffee since they don't have any in-room coffee and none is made available for guests until at least 7am, i.e., he couldn't care less that coffee was important to me -- it wasn't important to him or the W. Things are beginning to look worn, smell old around the hotel and in the rooms. ROOM: My room was clean and tidy, but surprisingly small for a supposedly 400 sf. Apparently some \"cool corner rooms\" are smaller/bigger than others which equals overpriced when you're getting stuck in the smaller ones. Maybe their new motto could be \"everything for a price\" from the $45/night parking and charges for in-room wi-fi (seems an odd charge when marketing yourself to the hip). FOOD: I dined at the Cafe and ordered room service. Service was spotty in the Cafe. Room service dining was inconsistent from night to night. If you fell in love with a dish or meal one night; don't expect to get the same quality the next. YUCK: Probably the worst of the stay was the smell of vomit in the lounge area on Sunday morning.

We looked at quite a few hotels, as never had stayed in a hotel in SF since we live so close and decided to splurge on this one. The W chain is well known and caters to the younger affluent business/party goers, which is evident when you walk into any of their hotels. Rude and arrogant, but decorated in a funky way. We arrived 2 hours ahead of check in (3pm) and called to let them know that we were going to be there early. When we got there they told us our room was not cleaned and we would have to wait in the lobby. Where they had free internet which is nice (but they don't provide wireless in the rooms, interesting isn't it. It is like 15-20 to actually get internet in your room). They want you to hang out downstairs to give that trendy vibe so people come out and hang out in their bar. Anyway the front desk guy was rude. Took our cell phone number to let us know when it was ready. There were maybe 30 people waiting for their rooms, and at 3 pm magically they were all cleaned. Basically they didn't want anyone to check in ahead of time, even though everyone knew they were done being cleaned. We had a Fabulous room on the 24th floor, which had a king corner view. The view was AMAZING. But we were paying a lot for that view so it was expected. They had a cute sitting corner and it was nicely decorated. However all the decorations were covered in dust (the frames, fake tree branch, games, books). The TV was oddly small and in a weird position that hurt your neck when trying to watch. The bed was comfy, however the sheets (which are supposed to be one of their trademarks) were not Wonderful. They had obviously been bleached and it doesn't matter what your threadcount is if you bleach it ever wash, it is no longer soft and luxurious. Also the room was not \"clean\" feeling as I would expect for the price that we were paying. THe bathroom was very nice but you could tell that it had been used A LOT. Overall the hotel is just okay. I am sure when it opened it was great, but it seems a bit worn around the edges for the amount of money you are paying. If you like the W hotels by all means stay here, but I feel that in a city like SF you can probably find something a little bit different and definitely cheaper. It was a disappointment to us.

There were so many things that were wrong about this hotel that it surprises me since I tend to travel to California quite often. 1. When you pull into their valet, it is an extremely narrow space. I wasn't even sure I was supposed to pull in there even though the sign indicated that it was the W Hotel Valet. 2. The front desk agent was fabulous when I arrived. She informed me of different aspects of the hotel like the spa and fitness facilities. She welcomed me to the hotel and offered me a room on a higher floor with a phenominal view since it was my first time staying at the W Hotel. The room was not ready but it had been vacant and all they needed to do was to get housekeeping in there to clean it. That was fine as I had some appointments that I needed to get to anyways, however, what I didn't know at that time was that my room would not be ready until almost 2:30 p.m. (5 1/2 hours later). 3. When you step outside to catch a taxi cab, there is no one there to call the taxi cabs. You have to walk down the side of the street yourself and either flag one down or find one yourself. 4. When I finally got into my room at 2:30 p.m., I wanted to take a look at the items in the cabinet (i.e. the mini bar with snickers, mints, etc). I tried my best to open the cabinet but could not get it open. I called the \"whenever, whereever\" button to see if I could have someone assist me. It rang, and rang, and rang... with no one to pick up. So I hung up the phone and dialed again... no one picked up again... the third time finally someone answered the phone. I told them that I could not open the cabinet and she said that someone would be up to open it for me.. 5. My room smelled terribly of smoke... this is a non-smoking hotel so when I get into my room, I expect to have a non-smoking room that does not blow you away with smoke smell from the guest before. 6. My tv did not work properly. I would select a channel and then a few minutes later, I would get previews for movies that I did not wish to purchase. 7. They give you one bar of soap... so if you stay at this hotel, be prepared to bring your own soap. 8. One of my lights did not work at all.. too frustrated to call anyone to fix it. 9. I called room service around 8:15 p.m. for just a light dinner. I ordered my dinner and then the room service operator informed me it would be 45 minutes for my peanut butter and jelly sandwich and popcorn... 45 minutes to make that? 10. In the hotel's information directory, they state that guests should leave 30 minutes before departure in order for your car to be brought around to the front - FYI.", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frisco, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWanna go back\u201d", "Author": "linda.cloudnine", "ReviewID": "UR32497741", "Content": "We Loved the W Hotel.

We stayed four nights in a room on the 23rd floor. Elevators were readily available and fast. Room was small but hip and lovely -good bed, large flat screen TV, bed side radio/alarm; view of the Bay Bridge, Embarcadero and downtown was spectacular. Downsides - room was adequate but on the small side, and there were only three shallow drawers to stash clothes in. They were assigned to my wife, and I crammed whatever I had on the shelves in the bed side table. Likewise the bathroom had limited space to put things out of the way. Bliss products were good and replenished regularly. As others have noted - there was no coffee pot in the room - but when we asked, one was delivered to the room along with packets of good coffee. My wife enjoyed a decent - but not great - overpriced massage at the Bliss Spa. We also found the exercise area well equipped and useful for our work-outs. The hotel has an arrangement with an Acura dealership to provide taxi service by prearrangement in the evenings. We found this a most useful, convenient, way with congenial drivers to take us to our reserved dinners on successive nights - from Slanted Door in the Ferry Bldg complex one night to Gary Danko's down near Fisherman's Wharf area on another. High speed internet connection is available in the room for a daily fee - but free in the lobby areas. An unexpected surprise was a ringside view of the annual \"Bay to Beaches\" race and sort-of-parade that unfolded down Howard St the morning after we arrived. I managed to get a snapshot of my wife - arm in arm with one of the more colorful men parading with nothing on but his ten gallon hat and boots. As I said - great location.

We drove, so we had to pay for 2 nights of valet parking, which ended up being $50 / night. Check-In was uneventful and we were on our way to our 20th floor room. The bedroom was very functional and had a few special \"W\" touches, but nothing that really stood out as trendy. A call to the front desk gets you a \"Whatever/Whenever, What is your wish\" greeting. We had extra towels, robes, and some toiletries delivered several times without much fuss.

The bar/lounge guests were in their mid 30's to early 40's, a bit older than what we were hoping for, nonetheless, the music was spot-on; the atmosphere was almost clublike. We did not end up drinking at either bar because we were looking for food. At 11PM, the XYZ restaurant was closing and our only option was the 24/7 room service. 2 orders of fries, a creme brulee and fried calamari were about $50, all inclusive. We must have also ate a few snacks from the in-room pantry, as 8 oreo cookies cost $9; $12 for 4 oz of cashews, etc. Not a big deal, but the pantry seemed more like a business opportunity for W than for our convenience.

In the past I stayed in W Los Angeles on Hilgard Avenue and it was superb so I decided to stay in W when I was on my business trip to San Francisco together with my two friends from Canada. I prepaid my room through Travelocity ang got the rate of approximately $250 Canadian ($200 US) per night. I have seen a lot of hotels in my life but this stay was the most horrible one account for the amount I paid for the room. First of all the hotel lobby is converted to a bar, which attracts so called \"fashionable\" San Francisco individuals. In reality the bar is full of punks enjoying themselves listening to the ugliest and loudest music I have ever heard. You can be sure that you will have a chance to listen to those musical masterpices from your room. In the evening of the second day I encounterd a live cockroach in my room. This fellow came out of the gap between the wall shelf and television and rapidly proceeded to the work desk in the direction of the window. What an opportunity to have such a wonderful neighbour for only $250 a night! It took me five minutes to chase and execute my guest. Next morning I reported this incident to the front desk and it seemed to me that their receptionist was not surprised at all. I suspect that the whole building is infested because cockroaches usually do not come alone. The receptionist assured me that the hotel would perform disinfection of my room and issue an official apology. Certainly no special cleaning was done apart from regular room service and I am still waiting for that promised apology. After we had checked out one of my friends discovered a charge of $75 applied to his account for drinks in the lobby bar he has never visited. Since it happened last week he still keeps calling the W trying to get his $75 back. The other friend of mine who also prepaid his room discovered a charge equalt to 8 cents (EIGHT CENTS) on his account when checking out. According to the hotel they made a mistake when giving a quote for his stay so the actual rate was eight cents more than the one my firend has prepaid. This EIGHtT CENTS charge was applied to his credit card. I can continue sharing my experience relating to this W hotel but I assume that what I have already mentioned herein is enough for a prospective visitor to San Francisco to make his decision about this hotel.", "Date": "February 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cW let down\u201d", "Author": "JKlondon09", "ReviewID": "UR23859813", "Content": "The culmination of our recent 3 week roadtrip of california and arizona was in the W san fran.

The W has all kinds of cutsie nonsense that gets in the way of comprehension. The operator answers with \u201cwhat is your wish.\u201d My wish of course is that she would answer with \u201coperator.\u201d The Internet service costs $15 a day but it stinks. Much better speed is available for free at any $150 a night motel. It would not run consistently faster than 200 kilobits per second which 20 or 30 times slower than a typical home DSL line. My slingbox would not work and it took forever to download files. W Internet is a small step above using a phone modem. Apparently the W is on an insane drive to save electricity. The room lighting is terrible. I happened to have a light meter with me so I took some measurements. At the work desk the illumination was 22 lux. There is no lamp or light anyplace near the desk. 22 lux is considered to be a light level suitable for inactive areas of warehouses. Offices work spaces are supposed to have 500 lux. If you want to read in bed at the W the light level is about 90 lux, a low but not impossible level for reading. The window benches have their own light which is so dim as to provide only 15 lux. The only place in the room with decent illumination was near the bathroom mirror where it reached 400 lux. The telephone in my W room started beeping at 3 AM for no apparent reason that I could discern even after several minutes of deciphering the instructions on the telephone printed in tiny, low-contrast type. Yes, I had my reading glasses on. It wouldn\u2019t stop beeping even when I unplugged the connecting wires. I called the \u201cwhat is your wish\u201d lady to ask what do to. She didn\u2019t know but offered to send someone to the room. Apparently calling the operator stopped the beeping. My next step would have been to put the telephone in the hall.

Stayed there on an almost sold out weekend of 6/28/08 for one night. As a plat member, was upgraded to cool corner room at the checkin (which is more spacious, got an extra window balcony to sit on). However, was travelling with friends so I requested a fabulous 2 doubles instead, no problems. Lobby: The staffs were friendly and efficient, the lobby is very hip/chic just like what you would expect at the typical W hotel. I like the hotel ambience espcially at night, so pretty. You'll see many people hanging out at the lobby XYZ bars at night time (There's a DJ there too). There's an Acura MDX Experience counter available from noon to 7ish at night everyday which gives you an one-way ride to most of the places in SF area (except airport, of course) and we did take advantage of it during our stay. The drivers are friendly and no sales pressure which is an added bonus. But due to the popular demand, I recommend reserve your time spot early! The Gym: Very nice, with complete sets of eplical machines, weights, and the swim pool /jacuzzi is right outside of the gym (which is very hip looking too). The gym opens 24/7 but the wet area only opens from 4am to 11pm. Bliss Spa is right across from the gym which is very popular for girls to have their mani/pedicure and other services but I did not get to try it out so I am not going to commend on that. The Room: Some room can be quite noisy at night since they are right next door to a firestation (so for those who hates siren at night, you should request a room away from the firestation). Good AC (very quiet), and the lights in the room are very nice too. The bed is the typical W bed, not as heavenly as the Westin Heavenly Bed but certainly better than Sheraton Sweet Sleeper and other competitor's bed. I actually bought the pillow and the mattress topper home after I stayed at this hotel since it gave me a really nice sleep. That tells you how much I like their bedding. The room is towards the small size (~300 sq ft?) but still plenty of space for you to store ur luggages n stuff. The shower pressure is good, not strong like rainforest but enough to wash you clean. Toiletries is the standard Bliss Sinkside 6 (lemon sage scent) which is one of my favorite hotel product. One thing, the bathroom door has no lock and its very clear/see thru!! so be prepared if you are not comfortable with it! This is one of the thing that annoys me the most at this property but hey, its W so you need to be more open minded about it. Turndown service available on request every evening. Parking: $42/night, 1/2 off if you drive a hybrid. Since its SF, I did not drive, its just so much easier to travel with their convinent subway system isn't it? Also, internet (WiFi) are free at the lobby so you'll bump into many people with their laptop throughout the day. Overall: This is a good, well maintained hotel and the renovations gave the room more \"freshier\" look instead of the dark depressing color. Some people liked it, some don't. Of course, the price can be high for most people (at least 200+/night) but if you want to have fun, meet people or just want to enjoy the W scene, you should give this property a try.

The decor is bright and friendly, and I really enjoyed the fact that I could close the mirrored doors over the TV and not have to see it. The beds are very comfortable, and the bathrooms come stocked with Bliss brand toiletries. (I usually snag a couple of the soaps to use at home.) I had need to use room service quite a bit. Breakfast was super-expensive relative to what you get, and not as nice as the other meals. I paid $44 for an omelette, toast, home fries, orange juice (not fresh) and coffee, and the eggs were rubbery, although the potatoes were good. Still, $44 is a heck of a lot of money for breakfast, so most mornings I hoofed it over to the Peet's on 3rd and Mission for better coffee. Lunch and dinner choices were better - the Cobb Salad was especially good. Still, an entree and an iced tea tended to land in the $35 range. I realy enjoy the ambience of the lobby bar. It's trendy without being snobby, and the service is very good even when the place is crowded. If you can get a weekend deal here, it's certainly worth it. It's walking distance to the ballpark, BART, right next to SFMOMA and it's easy to get pretty much anywhere without a car. All in all, I always enjoy the San Francisco W.

Places to get some food within a block; Ferrari's Italian Deli ($$, but great sandwich, cheese and crackers selections), a Starbucks on the corner, a Chevy's (Mexican) Grill next to it.

If you need to take a shuttle back to the airport, try \"Go Lorrie's\". It costs the same as the other shuttles (all of them are in the $15-18 range to and from SFO).

BED - I guess one of my biggest disappointment is the W BED or lack there of? W is known for the W Bed (Fluffy White Cloud bed you just sink into it) So when I got to my room in SF for a business trip, I thought the bed was very typical, not the fluffy type bed at all. I didn't think much about it, since I haven't stay at a W for awhile, maybe they changed the bed. Then I actually looked at the mattress, it was a Sealy Beautyrest (Starwood). W Signature Bed is made by Simmons [--] I talked to the front desk, the supervisor assured me that was the W Bed (Simmons), but then changed her mind when I told her about the Sealy mattress. Then the guy do room setup told me that Sealy is the W Bed older version and they are in the process of updating to the new W Bed (Simmons) within the next 3 weeks. They offered to add a feather bed to make me feel better. So just to be sure, I called W SF again and asked them about the W Signature Bed, the guy confirmed with me that ALL the rooms have the LATEST version W Bed (Simmons). Well...I was going to buy W Signature Bed in SF. I guess I won't be buy it anymore. I wish they can all stick to one story, maybe I won't be as mad.

Nothing in my account yet. -Room-There was water dripping in the bathroom, they said the bathtub upstairs didn't work, that why it's leaking to our bathroom. ahhh---I feel much better now. I'm sure I sound like a real drama queen. I hope no one has to go through the same thing! At the time of check out and my many complaints, front desk person said she will credit my account with an additional HALF day worth of points (Why Half a day of points...I have no idea...Do they actually want me to stay again at a W for half a night? or they hope I will never stay at a W again?) 7/24/2007 - Called back to the hotel front desk to find out why they never credited my account with the additional points...manager said he will call me back in a couple days after he follow up with the individuals. But I never got a call back. At this point, I'm not sure if I really want the point to stay at a W Hotel again. 8/14/2007 - Called back to the hotel again, spoke with guest relationship manager, and explained to him about my complaints. He was extremely nice to listen to me blah blah blah. He said he will follow up with his staff, and he will credit my account with the additional points.

The hotel was good, but has a few flaws - mostly service-related. I've stayed at many Starwood properties, but this was my first stay at a W. We used the BART system from SFO International to Powell Station. The ride cost $5.15, and it's about 4-5 city blocks from the station to the hotel. We checked in around 8pm, so it' wasn't busy. The process was reasonably fast, but not particularly friendly. They said all the right things, but I got the feeling I was talking to a robot, not a person. As a SPG gold member, I was upgraded to a 30th floor corner room. It was very nice, but a little on the small side. The bed was probably one of the best hotel beds I've ever stayed in. The down comforter was really nice too. The banquette in the corner was a nice place to sit while I reviewed paperwork; I would often look out the window to enjoy the view. There's a lot of nice little things like the W Music in the CD player, the Etch-a-Sketch, and current magazines (like Wired). One bad note about the room -- the noise. Eventhough we weren't adjacent to the elevators, we still heard them operating all throughout the night. It was difficult to sleep at first, but we got used to it eventually. Maybe the most obvious thing to point out is the glass window bathroom door. It's not completely transparent like a regular window, but it's not as translucent like frosted glass: it's something in between. Refer to the attached picture as a sample. All I can say is that I know some people will appreciate it, but some people will not. The bathroom itself is fine. Concierge service was disappointing. My wife asked about booking a tour to Alcatraz, and they simply provided her a website address to book. She assumed we had Internet access and didn't even offer to book for us. I thought that was odd. When I asked about breakfast recommendations, she gave two: the XYZ Cafe and Mel's (which is about 3 blocks away). They were both terrible. The XYZ is the hotel restaurant. Service was terrible; the server was grumpy, she was slow, and she didn't bother asking how our food was. The food was bad. I didn't bother going back for dinner. The W Cafe Lounge is okay. I got friendlier service there, and it becomes a hot spot at night. There are a lot of great places to eat in San Francisco, so I wouldn't waste your time at the XYZ. If you want a really nice dinner, I would suggest going to Ame, which is in the St. Regis, one block away. The hotel is conviently located across the street from the Moscone Center, and is right next door to the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA).

We've stayed at this W property around 5 times now. When greeted at the front desk upon arrival, the clerks are always pleasant, but this time there were probably 4 other groups of people checking in at the same time we were (around 4 p.m. on a Friday). The only problem is that everyone standing near the front desk heard every bit of everyone else's business, including room numbers and other stuff. It was kind of uncomfortable, and I'm used to a more professional check-in environment at the W. Upon getting to our room, we had an upper floor room designated for a bay view. Well, the bay view is disappearing fast with new big buildings being built in downtown San Francisco. One high-rise in particular has blocked a huge section of the view now so it's not the same as it used to be if you haven't been there for awhile. A couple of years ago, we had the \"city view,\" which is nice, especially during the holidays when the nearby park close to the Metreon is lit. The rooms are always nice and the W hotels always have a signature smell inside, which is wonderful. I have no idea what fragrance they use (and I was told by one of the clerks in the Bliss Spa on site that it is indeed a signature scent that is not sold anywhere on the property). This was the first time we ever noticed thin walls between rooms at the W. Either the rooms next to ours in the past were unoccupied or the people were extremely quiet. This time, we could hear actual conversations in the room next to ours and it was uncomfortable to say the least. One bad thing (or good, depending on how you look at it) is that the hotel is often a \"party\" type hotel, where you have a number of 20somethings who can be very noisy. Now that we're in our late 30s, it's beginning to get kind of annoying. :-) We heard a lot of door slamming and a lot of loud laughing in the halls at times like 3 a.m. and stuff like that. The Bliss Spa on site was very nice and the staff there was excellent... helpful and friendly and I'd give them an A plus. Some drawbacks are the ridiculous prices for the honor bar in the room. A $5 Reese's peanut butter cup? Are they kidding? And there are no soda machines anywhere on the property. We called their \"whatever whenever\" number at the hotel and were told that we could order room service if we wanted a pepsi or something similar. Ugh. We ordered breakfast from room service one morning and it was pretty standard fare... good but certainly not outstanding or unique in any way. Overall, it's a very nice hotel and you can't beat the location. The rooms could use some tweaking though. There wasn't even a sleep timer on the TV, and it wouldn't hurt the W to begin investing in plasma TVs. They want to be considered upscale yet they stick with older television sets, which is kind of strange. Their bathrooms are well-designed and very nice.

The management had the brilliant idea to staff only two bartenders at each location to serve the 300-400 people that came out for the bar scene on Saturday Night. One of my friends (a very attractive girl who one would expect might get immediate attention from a bartender) asked how much longer it would take to get a drink after she had already been waiting for twenty minutes.

If you have never stayed at a W hotel, you might be in for a suprise. This hotel pretty much embodies the W brand concept. As expected, the location was awesome (right next to all the shopping/dining). The checkin was flawless and we were given a room with unbelievable views on the 25th floor. The room was very nice, and had satelite radio, CD player, etc.. There was also a great big window seat you could stretch out on and peer out at the great view. Overall the rooms are great (they are upgrading them next year as they are 7 years old, but they are still in good shape). As for the service -- the common areas are very cool, with \"chill\" music playing and a dark, sort of club like atmosphere. The concierge (which W refers to as Whatever/Whenever) is top notch. They can do just about anything, just ask (like get us into the fully booked resturaunts, find an ENT doctor lickety split, etc..). They're just quality conierges, and W prides themselves on that. Now, here's where your parents might get a little freaked out. At about 8PM, the large lobby area which is scattered with lots of cool seating arrangments (which W calls the Living Room) changes into a club. So, say you go out for dinner and come back to the hotel at 10. Open the doors to the hotel and you are in a fully packed (with beautiful 20/30 somethings) \"living room.\" There is a DJ playing chill type music. There is a large bar that is full, and hopping. There are people mingling, eating (from their XYZ resturaunt) which is very good. Overall, just very busy. I like that -- you may not. To summarize this, we went out one night and talked to some locals at a club. They asked \"Why are you HERE if you're staying at the W?\" We proceeded to all go back to the Hotel to party. Take from this what you want -- there's another door you can enter to skip the nightly parties. But they're fun and very professional.

Ray also arranged our car rental to drive to Napa Valley and addressed any issues/questions during our stay with professionalism. We suggest future visitors to NOT rent a car during their stay in San Fran. due to parking rates. It is more cost effective to rent a car daily (which range b/w $39 - 59) so not to pay the $45 parking fee. Our rental was dropped off and picked up at the hotel, which was very convienent. The rooms were very clean, quiet and comfortable although a bit small. We enjoyed the location, away from the busyiness of Union Square (and, the homeless people) though within walking distance. It was great walking into the market area after eating dinner. The Farmer's Market at the Ferry Building was well worth visiting. We found the Fisherman's Warf very touristy.

From the time I arrived at this hotel until the time I left I was comfortable. And thats about it. Our taxi drew up and the first thing that strikes you as you walk in is the pleasant smell, and cool, dark atmosphere. Now when I say cool I don't mean it in the Fonz sense. The crowd was \"ageing businessman\". What I mean is the temperature was cool and refreshing. Check in highlighted the first major problem. Parlez anglais? My partner and I are British. We speak clearly, we have no funny accents or colloquialism's yet everytime we approached the front desk we found ourselves repeating everything we said. No where else did we encounter this problem except at this hotel. I can only think that they weren't listening the first time round....needless to say this was tedious and made the checking in process drawn out. Our room was on the seventh floor, just above the pool area. Not a bad location and the sound proofing was good. The room itself had two double beds, a large TV with CD player etc, coffee maker with selection of Tazo teas and W blend coffee, a large desk area and a comfy day bed. Here there were some nice touches; quality dressing gowns, Bliss spa products in the bathroom (and the Maids replenish generously!), a good selection of pillows on the beds and a day bed by the window to relax on. It is all very comfortable and I had no complaints. Ok, so the phone didn't work properly. After a protacted exchange with the front desk, where we had to repeat had to repeat had to repeat what we were asking for, it was fixed within a day. Now for the rest of the hotel... Both of us wanted to check out the gym and were pleasantly surprised. The emphasis here is on cardio. There are about 4 treadmills, all fitted with tv screens, a couple of bikes, crosstrainers and a selection of free weights, yoga mats and ab balls. Jet lag meant that we were down there at 5am. It seemed to get busy at 6am so time your visit carefully. Bliss is adjacent to the gym (both on the fourth floor). Now I am not a big Bliss fan but I did try and find out if they had any massage appointments available and they didn't. If you feel like spending $120 on a facial then make sure you book ahead. We didn't eat in the hotel for dinner but we did have breakfast in the XYZ (gettit?) restaurant one morning. I was thoroughly underwhelmed. Ordered cappuccino which came in a cup that I can only describe as Dolly sized. The fruit salad was okay but anyone can chop up melon, drizze Vanilla yoplait over the top and charge $13+ can't they? Mentally decided never to bother with that again....as an aside they have a less format buffet just outside XYZ and this looked better. Muffins, cereals, bagels and a barista are on hand to deliver a quick breakfast. The hotel is located in a decent area. They are lots of casual dining options nearby, you can walk to Union Square in less than ten minutes and it feels safe round there. Plus art lovers will love the fact that Moma is next door. Now to the rating. The W is a good hotel - but its not great. It charges high prices and bills itself as a cool hotel. But the fact is, it just misses the mark.

From start to finish my stay was superb. I arrived on an early flight and got to the hotel at 11:00 AM. Rather than take a cab I used the BART this time from SFO. It took about 30 minutes, cost $5.15 and if you get off at the Montgomery station it's only about 2 blocks to the hotel. Even though I arrived early it was still no problem getting a room right away and I was placed in an amazing Bay view room on the 25th floor. The room was typical for a W although it was fairly large. The list of amenities in the room was substantial. Bliss bathroom products, teeth whitening kits, mini stereo with Sirius satellite radio, big TV, big work desk, very comfortable window seats and fantastic in room coffee to name just a few. The room was spotless and also very quiet. For other reviewers who mention the price of parking or mini bar items, this is simply true to any hotel in the prominent locations of a big city like SF. As I walked around the area I noticed all hotels were posting $40 parking. For breakfast each day they set up an amazing spread in XYZ. Each morning I would grab a jumbo muffin and some fresh fruit for only $5, a bargain for hotel prices, and then make coffee in my room and enjoy reading the paper while being distracted by the beautiful view. The W has a very nice feel to it, extremely comfortable and friendly. On my last day there I needed the business center which happened to be closed as it was MLK day. No problem at all, the front desk sent someone with me to unlock it and give me access within 2 minutes of my request and then they didn't even charge me!

Its very clean and there are tvs at alot of the machines. There is free cold water and nice towels. - The room was what you can expect from a W - modern and a bit worn. The TV was a flat screen. The bathroom is very average. The Bliss products in the room are a nice touch. - The doorman and the front guest employees were upbeat and professional. The room service was OK but pricey. - THE WORST THING about this hotel is the very eery Spa. I booked a massage the first night I was there and when I got down there to check in I wanted to run the other way. The entrance to the Spa is lit with hideous and very COLD colored lights - flouresent. The mood is rockin and cold. The music is technojazzy - not slow and spa like. So I decide not to run the other way - but just to keep an open mind and get my massage... The locker room was worse than my high school locker room - chilly and brightly lit and, again, COLD. The waiting room was COLD, the massage room had lights that shined in your eyes.... the place has a huge hospital vibe to it. I have been to spas all over the world and this place was WIERD. talk about feeling like you are in a dressing room and the lights are making you look bad. It was hard to relax.

The Living room was filled with cool and sophisticated furnishings and contemporary art. At night, the Living Room was filled with a mass of people at the bar and all over the Living Room. You felt special walking through the crowd to go to the elevators. Elevators and Hallyway: The elevator was dimly lit but in a cool, fun way. The elevators were very quick and very large. When you get off the elevators, the carpet reads Welcome!. The Hallway was lit by blue lights and spotlights on the art. The hallways smelled like new carpet. Room: We booked a 2 dbl. bed, non smoking, Wonderful room. When you first walk into the room, there is a little area with a bench and 3/4 full length mirror/ The bathroom was to the left. You continue walking in and there is the 2 dbl. beds crammed into the room. A built in Tv cabinet that felt like it would fall on you! A Desk with leather chair, a nightstand with some San Francisco Magazines and a W Hotels Book. The Desk featured Bliss, The Spa catalouges, the hotel directory, and some paper and pencils. At the end of the room by the windows was a large window seat with 4 brown square pillows and 2 neckrole pillows. There was a dark blue throw on the window seat. The coushin was stained with white and red staines. I suggest that be recovered. The Beds we're so comfortable, I slept like a rock. They had 4 down pillows, a down comforter with a brown duvet cover. The duvet covers we're both stained and were pretty gross. The headboards we're really cool: They were big slabs of wood that stoped just before the ceiling. For the long morning sleepers, there were wooden shades that kept about 3/4 of the sunlight out. 3 complaints: 1. The windows DID NOT OPEN. 2. The windows we're terribly dirty and hard to see out of 3. You needed to keep the shades on the windows, if you try to move the middle ones to the center of the seat, the window seat is unuseable. And if you want to move the outer wooden shades, there we're 2 wall sconces on each side so you could'nt put them on the wall. I agree with the previous reviewers that some of the furniture was a little shabby and scrathced and probably needed to be replaced in the near future. The Artwork was black and white pictures of San Francisco. There was a 27 inch tv, a dvd player, a CD player, the W CD, and the mini bar, which was terribly overpriced. The carpet was brown and was alittle worn. Bathroom: The bathroom was pretty awesome! The sink faucets came out of the wall and the sink was metal. The shower head was great! Is almost massaged you. The shower curtain was clean and had the W on it. 1 complaint: The door was a glass slider and it didnt work well. The glass was not opaqe but ribbed and you could see in easily. It also didn't slid very easily. The robes were great and were 100% cotton. Sweat/Wet: That is W's pool and fitness center. Sweat: The fitness center looked pretty well equiped with alot of machines and quality machines. Wet: The pool was dissapointing. It didn't have WET on the bottom which wasn't a big deal but it was tiny. There was a family with about 2 kids and it seemed they took up the whole pool! The tile around the pool was also outdated. Whatever/Whenever: That was their service to their guests which was pretty efficent. I called down and asked for extra towels b/c our got wet and they we're there in about only 5 minutes! Great! To rap it all up: We had a pretty good time in SF and at the W, but it was not perfect. The rooms need to be changed a little bit and the pool updated.

As for the room, it was smallish, as was the bathroom, but quite comfortable and well-appointed. It also had a beautiful view of the Bay Bridge. There were two outstanding things about the room, though: 1. The most comfortable bed in the known universe (which, incidentally, you can buy from their website). I travel a lot and have been tortured by mattresses and pillows across the country, but this is simply superb sleeping. 2. It had a window seat. This may be just my own personal preference, but there is just somethig so appealing about sitting in a window seat on a cold, misty night, propped on nice soft pillows, looking out at the Bay Bridge, listening to good music and reading a good book.
