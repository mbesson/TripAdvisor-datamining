WRONG! We had better meals at more local restaurants where we were the only non-Romans! We had said to the concierge that we wanted a really local place but sadly this was very over priced for below average food.

As other reviews state , this small boutique hotel is owned by the prestigious Hassler Hotel located nearby. Having stayed in many 5 star hotels , I thought this was a great alternative. We requested , and were given apartment 4 which is effectively on the top floor - on the same floor as the restaurant and under the rooftop bar. I will come back to that later. Check in was at the Hassler and was seamless. The Hassler is located at the top of the Spanise steps on one side , whilst this hotel is located at the top of the Spanish Steps on the other side. It is a walk of about 50m. The room was the size of large standard room of any 5 star hotel. It was absolutely spotless clean , had a walk in robe , plenty of hanging space and a bathroom of very generous proportions , including a large bath and separate shower . The bed was very big and comfortable and the room was cleaned and towels changed twice per day. There was a table and chairs with windows opening with a terrific view of the Spanish Steps . You walked out of our room , up several steps , to an outdoor restaurant. The staff there were always friendly and even though we did not eat at that restaurant , they were always courteous and friendly towards us as we would walk past several tables and then up another flight of steps to the rooftop exit ( where there was also a bar ) and then out onto the top of the Spanish Steps. Exiting this way was much easier than getting the lift down to ground level and then walking a circuitous route. The rooftop bar only opens at 5pm and is a great place to chill out at the end of the day. It is not cheap for a drink as a standard beer was 9 Euros. The bar is open until around midnight. I was concerned that there may have been a ot of noise from the restaurant and bar filtering into our room at night but was pleasantly surprised that this was not the case. The only noise I heard one night was when the rooftop bar was being cleaned after closing and there was a sound of chairs being dragged across the floor. That only happened on one night. As it was so hot , we had to sleep with the windows closed and the air conditioning on. The room felt like it was soundproofed and the air con was extremely efficient. Breakfast was at The Hassler and included in our room rate of about $350 Euros per night. It was a standard continental breakfast . Beware if you ask for anything cooked , you will be charged up to 20 Euros. There are complimentary pushbikes and one day we cycled around the nearby park which was a great way to spend several hours. The hotel is very centrally located and is walking distance to most of the attractions and some great restaurants - not to mention the shopping. Before coming to Rome , we had been in Positano and Capri where the hotels cost double that of Il Palazzetto and as such , I thought it represented great value for money. I found the staff at The Hassler to be friendly and courteous as well and certainly do not agree with some of the comments expressed in other reviews. Would I stay in this hotel again - undoubtedly yes. It is a great alternative to your traditional large 5 star hotel , which I think can be quite impersonal. If possible , I would suggest you ask for room 4 as this is the only room on the top floor.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Room, but Will Not Stay Here Again\u201d", "Author": "cg0994", "ReviewID": "UR74367997", "Content": "We returned last month from our amazing 16 night trip to Italy. Our home for our last 2 nights of this trip was il Palazzetto. Check-in at the Hassler Hotel (the sister property, where you check in if you are staying at il Palazzetto) was smooth, and we were shown Room 1, a nice sized room with a view overlooking the Spanish Steps. The becolumned decor was luxurious, featuring a spacious armoire stuffed with amenities at the foot of the enormous and comfortable bed, big bathtub and separate glass-doored shower. We had breakfast at the Hassler, which is included with the room when you stay at Il Palazzetto. The Hassler is pretty fancy, and the service inattentive, bordering on snobbish, a big change after all the enthusiastic service throughout Umbria and Tuscany on this trip, but breakfast itself was fine. At some point on our second day, we made the mistake of trying to print out our boarding passes at the Hassler. We had asked the front desk at the Palazzetto how to get our boarding passes printed, and she said to go to the Hassler's concierge, and he would print them for us. Not so, as all he was willing to do was point us to the main desk to ask for a key to the business center. The \"business center\" turned out to be a closet with two computers and a printer, which, we discovered upon trying to print, was out of black ink! After first calling back down to the front desk, then my husband actually GOING back to the front desk, they told us in their perfect English that a technician would be coming by to resolve the issue. The man they sent, though, spoke no English, and was NOT a technician of any sort we could determine. He spent some considerable time randomly clicking around in Windows, as if to discover the root of our problem, while the print queue (and the printer itself) flashed the answer at him in his own language! Sadly, we didn't know how to say \"black ink cartridge\" in any way that made sense to him, and he couldn't, ultimately, help us! So we went BACK to the front desk, where THEY were unable to print out our boarding passes, because, on the airline's website, it thought they'd already been printed!!! We walked away with no boarding passes. It was very frustrating, and between the indifferent attitude and the incompetence, we will not stay there again. (As far as we know, the legendary Hassler Hotel, favored stay for world leaders and movie stars, at the top of the Spanish Stairs since the 1800s, still has no black ink in their printer. Good luck.) While in Rome we visited the main sites, and ate at two very good restaurants, Sangallo and La Tavernetta.

The Hassler is classic and posh - not somewhere I'd favor staying- which made it perfect to visit and sleep in the more modern less stuffy Il Palazetto. Since our stay was in August, we actually had to check-in at the Hassler and use their concierge services because the wine school and front desks in Il Palazetto were closed for August. This wasn't a problem at all since The Hassler was so close by. The bars in both hotels are beautiful in your own right (you can get on the roof of the Hassler for a great view of Rome). The room in Il Palazetto was amazing. Spacious, plush, plush bed. Great tub. The window in our bathroom overlooked a side area on the Spanish steps. You could hear the heartbeat of the city if you wanted or close it if you wanted. It was so fun to sit on the steps and be part of the action but even nicer to sit in Il Palazetto bar and people watch. Stay here! We got an amazing deal in August!

We arrived a late (after 11.30pm) and as mentionned in the email confirming my reservation, we went straight to the Hassler to check in. We were greeted by Manuel who was charming, welcoming and very helpful. He took us to our room and made many excellent suggestions as to where to go for a drink and where to go for dinner the next day. All very positive. The room was fine, nicely appointed but no view but that was made clear at the time of booking so no complaint there. Our issues were really when we tried to ask the Palazzetto staff anything - e.g. recommendation for a restaurant: they could only be bothered to recommend a couple of abvious ones and in very touristic locations which is exactly what we did not want. The very annoying part came at check out. We left our room on the third floor and took all our luggage to the reception to be told that we could not check out at the palazzetto and check in and check out were only at the Hassler. When I questionned this and said they should have told us earlier, the lady at reception then replied very aggressively that it was in the confirmation email I received (I checked and it was not) and that it was very clearly stated on the 2 pages of hotel information left in our room and it was really our fault and we should have read all the information received (!). Now ,we are on a weekend break with lots to see and do and I do not spend my spare time reading an A4 sheet of paper left somewhere in the room. What we especially disliked was the aggressive and patronizing tone used by this lady and the way she kept arguing with us, including with my boyfriend once I had gone all the way up to the Hassler to settle the bill. Clearly this is not a behaviour I expect or find acceptable in a hotel of such standard. This was made even more confusing when the charming staff at the Hassler told me I could have checked out at the Palazzetto...

Try to get one of the two rooms that face the Steps on the third (?) level. Although right on the Steps the rooms are surprisingly VERY quite.

The staff were all very helpful and every morning we had a lovely breakfast at the Hassler Hotel, just up from Il Palazzeto at the top of the Spanish Steps. Unfortunately the restaurant at Il Palazzeto was closed for the August holidays, but we were still able to enjoy a drink on the rooftop bar and terrace. This was truly an experience in relaxed indulgence. Sitting up on the terrace in the early evening, sipping my Campari and soda and watching the crowds exporing the Spanish Steps below. I had the whole terrace to myself for most of the time and sat on the comfy red upholstered cussions along the marble parapet and soaked in the atmosphere. (sigh....). It was a blissful way to cap off a day of exploring Rome. My only word of warning is about catching taxi's from or to the Hotel Hassler. I imagine that once you tell a taxi driver that your destination is that hotel, they decide to see how much money they can get out of you. On the trip from the train station to the hotel we were charged 30 euro. Upon reaching the hotel, the driver let us off on the other side of the road from the hotel, rather than dropping us off at the entry. The hotel staff told me that he did that because they want to avoid the scruitiny of the doorman as the fare should have been around 15 euro. On a trip from the hotel to Campidoglio, the driver did the old trick of switching a smaller note for a bigger one. For a 13 euro fare I gave him a 20 euro note, asking for a 5 back. As I looked away to collect my bag, he said I had only given him a 5 euro note, which he held up to me. I wasn't in for an arguement with an italian taxi driver and wasn't completely sure that I hadn't made this mistake he said I had made. So I just gritted my teeth and paid him the rest. That was the only negative experience I had in Rome and it didn't affect my overall postitive experience of the city and of Il Palazzetto. One last point to mention. They were working on the plumbing at Il Palazzetto during our stay and we did have a few occasions where we did not have either cold or hot water, mostly in the afternoon. As compensation we were granted our request to use the shower facilities at the Hassler Spa the evening of the day we checked out. This was prior to our 24 hour plane trip back to Sydney and made such a difference to us. The Hassler staff was very accommodating and we were given as much time as we needed to freshen up.

This hotel is affiliated with the Hotel Hassler, one of Rome\u2019s nicest and most expensive hotels, but we were able to stay at Il Palazzetto and get what I assumed to be comparable service, at a little bit more affordable price. We stayed in one of the rooms looking out to the Spanish Steps. It doesn\u2019t really overlook the Steps, but just kind of looks directly out to the Steps at eye level. The room was enormous and beautifully decorated. The bathroom had a lovely, large bathtub, as well as a stand-up shower. The bathroom was stocked with shampoo, lotion, and bubble bath, but only 1 bar of soap for the sink. Our bathroom also had a window overlooking a side street, and it was nice to open that window and let some cool air in and listen to the hustle and bustle of Rome while relaxing in the bathtub. The main room had a large bed that was very comfortable, and a nice flat screen television. There was plenty of space to store our luggage and also walk around the room without bumping into things. We were not able to control the heat, and the room got really warm at times. Not a huge problem, we would just throw open the windows. When the windows are open, it is noisy from all the people on the Steps. So, if you want to sleep, keep the windows and the shutters closed! We also heard lots of noise from the staff upstairs in the morning cleaning the rooftop terrace and generally getting ready to start the day. The sounds start early in the morning and are basically heavy chairs and tables being dragged across the floor, which echo down into the rooms. You will hear this noise throughout the day from people eating on the terrace, but we never had any issues at night. Of course, we never got back to our room until midnight or later, so I can\u2019t really say what the noise level is like in the mid to late evening. The noise didn\u2019t bother me too much, I would just put in my ear plugs when it would start up in the morning, and I could keep sleeping. But, be prepared. Breakfast was over at the Hotel Hassler every morning. Our 1st morning, we ordered our cappuccinos, and headed up to the buffet tables for eggs, baked goods, cheeses, meats, fruit, etc. To our surprise, we were handed a bill for 80 Euro! 40 Euro per person they charge for this breakfast buffet. We called our server over and questioned about breakfast being included with our room rate. Turns out \u2013only baked goods (no fruit, nothing hot) are included with the Il Palazzetto room rate. Not one member of the hotel staff ever discussed this with us before until this incident happened. When we entered the main dining room, they have all the breakfast foods mixed together on 2 different tables, so we had no idea. We thought it was just a general buffet, and that we were free to eat whatever was available. They did end up taking care of the bill, and at that time explained to us that we were allowed baked goods only with the room rate. We were very disappointed with this news! I\u2019ve read other reviews on this site that discuss all the items available for breakfast, and so I\u2019m thinking that maybe they just recently made the change for the Il Palazzeto guests to not have the entire breakfast buffet included with their room? This is very disappointing. Our room did not come with direct access to the Internet as advertised. We were told that if we wanted to use the Internet, we could do so in the business center of the Hotel Hassler. We never inquired about this again, but their website does state that each room is equipped with \u2018direct access to the Internet\u201d. We weren\u2019t provided with that, but maybe that comes down to the lack of communication on their part again? The staff working the front desk was friendly. However, they were not able to provide us with good information on places to eat and drink in the area. We asked for recommendations of enotecas, and we were given information that there was one down the street about 2 blocks, but they didn\u2019t know the name of it. Oh well, we found many delicious places to eat and drink on our own in the area. It\u2019s Rome, after all! Big umbrellas are available in the lobby to guests, and that was a nice touch. The staff at Hotel Hassler was stuffy. I guess that is to be expected. Overall, we really did enjoy our stay at Il Palazzetto, but I think that the communication and service from the hotel staff could be improved. This never put a damper on our trip, but for the amount of money spent on a room and the affiliation with Hotel Hassler, we expected much more. We would probably consider staying here again because the room was so spacious, and the location was wonderful, but we would just have to settle on lowering our expectations of the staff and general amenities.", "Date": "April 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jersey, CI", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Location\u201d", "Author": "Orm-1", "ReviewID": "UR10941425", "Content": "My husband & I spent 5 nights at this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed it.

We wanted to splurge on our last night, and while we couldn't afford the Hassler, we could afford it's smaller sister hotel next door, Il Palazzetto, which sounded perfect for us, as it overlooked the Spanish Steps, had a terrace to sip wine on, and seemed, based on the website and reviewers' photos, quite luxurious. However, upon arriving at the Hassler for check in after a frustrating four-hour drive from Tuscany into hectic Rome and much in need of R&R, we were stunned to hear that despite our confirmed reservation, our room at the Il Palazzetto was not available due to a plumbing problem. Instead of being provided lodging at the Hassler, as one would assume, we were told that there was no room at the Hassler for us. However, they could put us up across the street at the Scalinata di Spagna, a small hotel we were unfamiliar with. Best of all, they said that they would comp us for the room charge. While we were disappointed with this news, as we were greatly looking forward to our stay at Il Palazzetto, it sounded fair considering that the room was free. We had little option but to accept the offer. Unfortunately, the room at the Scalinata was dirty, dingy, and reeked horribly of cheap perfume, perhaps from some type of carpet deodorizer to mask the smell. We tried airing the room out but it was futile. This is not somewhere we would have ever chosen, even at a great rate, and clearly it was not comparable to Il Palazzetto. Yes, the Scalinata had a semi-private terrace with a rooftop view of St. Peters in the distance, but we weren't sleeping on the terrace but in a dirty, smelly, tacky room. So while it was free, it still came at a price: our comfort and enjoyment. Again, we were willing to pay for comfortable accommodations, but the Hassler seemed more concerned with dumping us somewhere to solve their problem than making sure its guests' needs were met. We were looking for more than a place to sleep. We were looking for a four-star experience. On a side note, The Il Palazzetto offered to honor our complimentary breakfast at the Hassler, which unfortunately we could not enjoy, as we had to fly too early the next morning. The Hassler's room manager also offered to upgrade us from Il Palazzetto to the Hassler the next time were visiting Rome, but as it took us years to save for this trip and we live so far away, I'd be surprised if the hotel will actually honor this upgrade should we return some day.

Another great thing going for Il Palazzetto is its affiliation with the Hotel Hassler. Make no mistake, the Hassler is a grand hotel, as grand as any, however, there is a very real warmth there. The staff I thought were excellent. The ladies that run the breakfast are delightful - very friendly, but a little cheeky with it which is great fun! The breakfast spread by the way is impressive - something for everyone from fruits and cereals to hot scrambled eggs and bacon. Yum! Giovanni on the front door will work tirelessly to get you a taxi, and again, is a real delight. Andrea in the lounge bar is great fun, and extremely friendly, but also excellent at his job - he should be treasured by this hotel as a credit to their industry - he makes wonderful effort on behalf of his guests. His bar colleagues too are first class. Now for the but, and its big! Il Palazzetto is extremely noisy! They have spent a fortune on keeping the outside noise down to almost zero with great windows and shutters, which are very necessary as the Spanish Steps are RIGHT outside and are crowded all day and night, but the inside of the building is made of marble, and the sound literally reverborates so that even a whisper on the ground floor, is like a scream by the time it reaches the rooms at the top. The staff are up and down the stairs all the time, and obviously have a chat as they go, but the resulting echo means that you will hear everything! The biggest problem however is the noise generated on the rooftop. The tables and chairs are cast iron, and at 7am the cleaning and waiting staff are preparing for their day, and these tables and chairs are dragged across the roof, and the noise that comes into the room is deafening. You will not sleep later than 7am for sure, and will not be able to go to bed until at least 10pm at night when again, the terraces are being cleaned, and the tables and chairs are being dragged. After long days on the hoof, your room is where you go for some quiet sanctuary, but this is not possible here, not at all. Saying that, if you don't plan to be in your room during these times, then this review shouldn't put you off. There is plenty to recommend about Il Palazzetto, and if not for the noise problem, I'd have rated it as excellent, but after a long year and a real need for relaxation, I did have a problem with not being able to sleep at least a little longer.
