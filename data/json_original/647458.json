Whilst there is nothing around and nothing to do in the immediate vicinity, the hotel itself is lovely. It's modern with good facilities albeit we were frustrated that the was was shut at 10.30pm on the Saturday night! There's a great little bar about 5 mins walk called Ranquilla 17 - turn right outside the hotel and then left over the bridge towards the metro station. Metro into the centre of Madrid (sol) took about 20 mins - it's all air conditioned, very quiet and a pleasant ride - unlike the London tube! I'd recommend the hotel but if you're going to see the sights and stay here then be prepared for a few metro journeys.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Herts.

It is located in a residential / office neighborhood. There is nothing to do anywhere close to this hotel. If you are looking for some nightlife / weekend fun while traveling, move on down the metro a few stops to Goya and stay in that area. It is a 10-12 minute walk to the San Lorenzo metro stop, so be prepared for a hike each time you want to leave unless travelling by taxi. The staff here is wonderful. Keep in mind, this is Madrid not Paris or Berlin, so the English is not spoken extremely well. Some basic Spanish will go a long way and will be appreciated. The mini-bar is free. It is limited in terms of its stock. Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, Fanta, and water plus 1 regular beer and 1 non-alcoholic beer per day. However, it is quite large so one can stock the fridge with other things like leftovers or beer from the grocery store. The gym is small, a treadmill, a bike, a few free weights and a bow-flex universal lifting machine. However, there is a TV, a stereo system and unlimited free individual bottled water, so its not too bad. Wish they had a pool. The room is nice and modern with a comfortable bed. Typical European hotel room, it is small. Breakfast is great. They have a buffet, but they also have a \"made-to-order\" menu with \"huevos fritos\" (fried eggs) and various cooked meats. Fresh squeezed orange juice and wonderful breads from the buffet make this a great breakfast. The only major negative is the wifi. It is free in the lobby but requires payment in your room.

An unexplained heat source behind the bathroom mirror made the mirror too hot to touch and heated the bath room all night. At the same time the room A/C system did not respond to the wall mounted thermostat. It went on to lower the room temperature to that of a fridge. The only option was on or off. Breakfast was buffet style with sufficient selections for everyone's taste. We did not eat dinner in the restaurant, but enjoyed very good Italian cooking in a reasonably priced neighborhood restaurant: A'Fenestella 100 yards from the Mar de Crystal square and subway station, or a short taxi ride from the hotel. Walking to the San Lorenzo subway station was an 8-10 minute affair, and from there downtown Madrid was reached in 20 minutes for one Euro with one change of subway lines along the route, not exactly the ideal but definitely an option for someone to visit Madrid' s downtown sights, all of which are near a subway exit.
