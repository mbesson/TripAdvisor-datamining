It was raining and once the taxi came, the driver was not sure where the place is on the street. Not to lose time, Ali took his phone, directed him first to the street and called him afterwards to direct him as we drive. I thought that was wonderful.

The only small downside was the complexity of the taxi driver to choose the right turn when coming back to the hotel.

Two swimming pools and a spa to boot.

It is an experiment to try to bring \"luxury\" into a remote area of Istanbul that offers no aesthetic surrounding whatsoever. We were at the Divan Asia for the Formula 1 Grand Prix, because of its proximity to the Racetrack. Some of the top-VIPs of F1 stayed at the hotel during the same time. The proximity to Sabiha G\u00c3\u00b6kcen Airport may also bring business to the hotel, but there are other options like the Airport Hotel itself. The roof terrace of the Divan Asia is probably its nicest feature. In the future, I'd rather stay in a hotel in Istanbul proper.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel, friendly staff, but the location?\u201d", "Author": "drhako", "ReviewID": "UR52565748", "Content": "We stayed this hotel for my daughter's birthday past weekend.
