Helpful and friendly staff who found us two rooms to check into at 8:00AM, as we came in on a 7:00AM flight. The rooms & baths were decent size and very clean. Breakfast was typical European cereal, fruit, bread, croissants, yogurt, juice, coffee, etc., all good but not outstanding.

On the positive side, there is a metro station just outside the door and the ride into the centre of Madrid is very easy, quite cheap, and only takes 15 minutes or so. We were a bit concerned about the possible noise from the nearby bullring as we were staying during a festival when there were bullfights every night, but in fact the ring is designed to keep the noise inside the stadium so there was no outside noise at all. And the 25000 spectators who appeared every evening at 7pm had all vanished again by 10pm with not a hint of noise or bad behaviour. The hotel is on a busy road - if that's likely to be a problem for you, you can do what we did and ask for a room at the back, which had no traffic noise at all but also didn't have much of a view. The advantage of being on a main road is that as well as the metro, there are also buses going into central Madrid from just outside, and also it's very easy to hail a taxi from right outside the hotel. We were impressed with the reception staff - the ones we spoke to all had good English, and were very knowledgeable and helpful. We went for the all-you-can-eat buffet breakfast, which was OK but a bit disappointing by Accor/Novotel/Ibis standards - there were pastries and juices etc but not much in the way of cooked food beyond Spanish ham and cheese. If you want sausage and eggs for breakfast you would be better going to one of the cafes up the road - there are several quite basic cafes, bars and restaurants within walking distance, and a decent Turkish cafe across the road. There is a nice tapas cafe 5 minutes walk away in Manuel Becerra place. There are also a couple of small supermarkets below the hotel which sell snacks and all kinds of drinks. The room we had was clean and comfortable - not surprising as the hotel is very new - and although the room was quite small, it was about what you'd expect for an Ibis. All in all, we were pleasantly surprised by the hotel - but not too surprised, as we've stayed in a lot of Ibises and always found them to be good value and reliable. There are two things I would criticise this particular hotel for: there is no tea-making facility in the room (you can order room service but that isn't cheap); and, even by modern hotel standards, the sound insulation isn't great, so if you're a light sleeper and you have a noisy next-door neighbour, you could be in for a broken night's sleep. Some people might also dislike the non-central location, but that wasn't a problem for us as we very rapidly got to love the Madrid metro system. If only London's was as cheap and efficient!", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNew Madrid hotel in quiet central location\u201d", "Author": "NileCrocodile", "ReviewID": "UR131847346", "Content": "Only opened in 2012.

The hotel staff are friendly and they speak English.Our room was neat with a nice bed and a clean toilette.There was a television, hair dryer and writing desk. The hotel gives you one hour free WiFi but you have to ask for it in the reception.Otherwise they charge 5 euro per day for internet facility.You can pay and have breakfast. Just around the corner of the street where the hotel is located, there is a nice Open Car grocery store which is well stocked with daily needs.You can get cheaper drinks and ready to eat food. Overall, we had a memorable stay and it was pocket friendly as well! I recommend it for others who want a budget stay at a good location in Madrid.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat new hotel\u201d", "Author": "Barnstones", "ReviewID": "UR127553312", "Content": "Stayed 3 nights at start of April 2012 in a family room.
