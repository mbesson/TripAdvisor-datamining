It makes for an odd mix of guests. During our stay there were a couple of seminars or courses going on in the meeting areas, so the lobby was typically quite busy. That said, parking was never an issue over the 6 days we were there. The staff were very friendly and helpful whenever we had questions or requests. The weather wasn't the greatest when we were there, so no comment on the pool. Wi-fi was free and generally worked well, although they did have a system issue the morning we left. The location is fairly central to many attractions in the San Diego area. We found that we were about 25 min from Carlsbad/Oceanside, and 15 min from Downtown/Balboa park. 10-15 min to La Jolla. About 5 mins east of the hotel there are a couple of shopping centres with decent restaurant options and places to get provisions. It's close to Miramar, so we often saw and heard military aircraft, although the noise didn't interfere with sleeping at all. The rooms are basic but clean, roomy and comfortable, easily meeting the expectations of the star level of the property. In my opinion, they represent good value. Our room had a small fridge, a microwave, and a mini coffee maker. The breakfast buffet is more than a continental, and the offerings rotated throughout our multi-night stay. There were often eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, etc. There's also a waffle maker that is a high-demand item. The food quality is decent but not fantastic, but seeing as it's included in the stay I thought it was excellent value. They also have a little refreshment stand by the front desk, which was nice to grab a drink or fruit/cookie on the way in or out. *note* - management actively solicits Trip Advisor feedback via email after your stay, even noting that they've targeted you because you have gave good review to their internal survey they send out via multiple emails post-stay.

Upon calling the front desk we were told the hotel was out of cribs. Prior to our arrival we had rented a baby swing and some other gear, the front desk informed is that they has not received any deliveries, after calling the company we rented from, they told us it had been delivered and was in a closet by the front desk. Suddenly the front desk was able to locate the swing, etc. We were told room service began at 5. We called at 5 to get some milk for the kids and no one picked up and we kept being transfered to the front desk. The \"resturaunt\" only had one person working. The front desk suggested we call back in 15-20 mins. After the long, difficult day we had had, we need to get the kids in bed. We had to make our way back downstairs to get the milk.

I felt bad for the staff when I saw front desk agents, cooks, and bellmen bussing tables, and refilling food and beverage stations with only one server on duty. The rooms were average, nothing special, and the bathroom / vanity area fits one person only. If we weren't so tired from our San Diego activities, the sound of a bathroom fan like ROTOR originating from behind the headboard would've kept us awake all night. To satisfy my curiousity, I stepped into the guest hallway and heard the same sounds coming from every room all the way down to the elevator landing at 2am in the morning. The hotel has two elevators, but only one was working, so on a sold out weekend, we had the unfortunate task of having to stop at every floor, and watch families get stuck hoping that the next elevator would be able to accomodate them. As a former hotel employee of ten years, I recommend future guests to always ask reservations staff what the hotel occupancy will be in order to avoid situations like these, so if price is your goal and you don't mind being in a full house, this is for you!

We booked because it was a decent hotel (not a motel), lots of free parking and because of the free breakfast buffet (GREAT value for families). It was the only one I could find in this price range that had a pretty full buffet - they always had 3 hot dishes (eggs, bacon, sausages, has browns, etc). It was fairly booked up so the breakfast timing was fairly important if you wanted the waffles (bit of a line-up!). They had a sufficient amount of fresh fruit at breaky for the healthy conscious. They also had a jar of apples or cookies depending on the time of the day near the check-in desk. Rooms were quite spacious...something you notice with 4 people, even if 2 of them are of the short version. Pool looked fine but we didn't have time to use it. Counter staff were great.

The rooms are of a very good size, nicely appointed and clean. The same goes for the bathroom, which left a very good impression. There was an AC unit outside our window which came to life every once in a while and rustled for a few minutes, but otherwise it was very quiet. The free WiFi worked great.

We had forgotten a laptop charger at the hotel and I called them to days after - I was not actually expecting much of a chance since often hotels are not overly interested in helping in these matters and was very surprised by the positive reactions of the staff - they called me back as promised, found the charger and shipped it. Very nice and unexpected - a big thumbs up! Positive: - Room (esp. bathroom) I would not have expected - they simply lacked the 'cheapishness' often found in non-luxury chain hotels.

Free wireless in our room was great! The registration staff were courteous and well informed about San Diego. Breakfast was good, with eggs and sausage as well as the usual continental. The second night there were some loud young people banging doors at about 9:00 pm but hotel security quickly came up and quieted them without our having to call. Location wise, it is north of the city itself but highways are easily accessed. It took us about 20 minutes to drive to the Embarcadero, for instance.

Even though the area wasn't that great, we loved the Country Inn. From the moment we walked in, we felt very welcome. When we needed a place to stay in, or near, San Diego, California, and we discovered there was a Country Inn in the area, we jumped at the chance to book it. Check In was fine, one of our rooms wasn't ready(We had booked two rooms) but it wasn't a big deal. There is a Chili's right across the parking lot so we ate there while we waited. The woman at the front desk that aided us in check-in was very nice and polite. I think her name was Joyce. Our room (617) was nice. We had a king size bed(which was verrryyy comfortable!) with a desk, tv, chair, and a decent size bathroom with ample amenities. We had a view of the office buildings across the street and a side view of the pool which wasn't so bad. There was no funky odor in the room, nor did I find any un-cleanliness. Even though the pool could've been a bit warmer, it was pretty large and was clean. The jacuzzi was good too! I didn't use the exercise room, but it looked fine. Breakfast: Awesome! I'm a big breakfast person, and when it comes to breakfast, I'm very picky. I loved the fact that they put out Dannon Lite & Fit yogurt, along with muffins, pancakes, sausages, eggs, potatoes, juices, coffee, cereal, toast and a waffle maker. It wasn't gourmet, but it was pretty good; and the best part is it's complimentary! I loved the lounge area by the bar. At night, there were always people hanging out, watching tv, or just doing work on their laptops(lots of business folks stay here). Overall, I loved my stay at the Country Inn & Suites. The staff was friendly and helpful, our room was fine, and the hotel itself is well kept(Cleanliness, landscaping, decor, etc.) I definitely recommend this hotel!!!", "Date": "September 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guelph, Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery Good Experience\u201d", "Author": "sb_tor", "ReviewID": "UR8722986", "Content": "Difficult to put this hotel down.

The best part was the complimentary morning breakfast. The selection was huge. Being a business district, the area is nice and clean but nothing nearby. You will need a car, and you will have to drive a bit see the sights. The hotel has a room service menu. There is also a chili's restaurant next door, which is quite good. welcome change from the other 4 star hotels we stayed in during the trip where nothing was complimentary (parking, internet, breakfast, business services like printing).

The toilet was filthy, room wasn't cleaned well, mustard packet lying on the floor of the room, there was no soap in the toiled, and there was an opened shampoo bottle on the bathroom floor. We had already hauled our baggage up to the room and were too tired after our long drive, to change rooms. The next morning we discovered that the water was clogging in the tub.

The staff is great and always ready to help. One warning though. We arrived late and they only had smoking rooms left. I was told that if I wanted to switch rooms the next day to just let them know. Our room did not really smell like a smoking room, so we decided to not go through the trouble of switching. The problem came when the people moved in to the room next door (7th fl is the smoking floor). Can you say Chimeneys?

The hotel is located off the 805 fwy and is close to many dining and entertainment facilities that can be reached by traveling east about 4 miles on Mira Mesa Blvd. For those who like to get to a mall there is the University Towne Center or UTC that is 4 miles south via the 805 fwy.
