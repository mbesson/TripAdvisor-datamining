It is very convenient to the Chinatown MRT station and many shops/restaurants. The hotel is located in an old Chinese opera house and its decor reflects its history (lots and lots of red). \u00a0The entrances to the hotel are on Smith Street and on Temple. There's another Santa Grand (Chinatown) on the same block. We stayed in one of the deluxe rooms overlooking Smith Street. As Smith Street is one of the Chinatown food streets, rooms on that side of the hotel are very noisy until around midnight, but relatively\u00a0quiet after that and in the morning. (The rooms on the other side of the building or on the alley may be quieter.) No refrigerator in the room, but they are available; there is good free wifi. Good shower, but it flooded the bathroom every time we used it.\u00a0 Staff is generally very helpful and friendly, but told us that couldn't change our room upon request because they were fully booked. We've also stayed in the Porcelain Hotel in this neighborhood. The rooms at Santa Grand are larger and more comfortable, but noisier.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mudgee", "Title": "\u201cOn the food street of China town.\u201d", "Author": "Titania2000", "ReviewID": "UR126480487", "Content": "Good bed and shower excellent pillows.

The rooms are compact but very comfortable, good quiet AC, flat screen TV, safe, and excellent wifi included. The room had glass French doors and shutters opening towards the street, nice in the evening to get some fresh air. The floors are polished wood, no carpet!

The bathroom was very modern but the shower does get water all over the floor. The room had a flat screen TV in the bed \"chamber\" -- lots of English stations. The a/c was great -- I had just spent a week in Thailand and compared with there, this room was like a freezer. The bed was rather hard, but this is typical of Asia. And the free wifi worked very well. I found the staff to be very helpful on check-in, and the bellman took me up to my room and explained the amenities. There is free tea down the hall.

It is a cool little hotel in the middle of Chinatown, with fantastic prices in overpriced Singapore. Or, the hotel\u2019s rooms are shoeboxes, barely bigger than my walk-in closet at home. Both descriptions are correct. The hotel is located off Pagoda Street, right in the center of Chinatown, a short distance from the subway station, financial district, etc. Red is the predominant color \u2013 practically the only color all the way to your room, in what is a former Chinese opera house. The rooms are basically a bed and the space to stand up next to the bed. I was upgraded to the double, from a single, and I hate to imagine the size of the single. So know that \u2013 if you need space, don\u2019t stay here. If you read the other reviews, you are forewarned. But if you are ok in a small but well-appointed, modern room, with a surprisingly roomy bathroom, given the size of the room itself, you will like this place. My bed was comfortable, the A/C was blasting but the down duvet and pillows were wonderful. Everything very clean and new. Wi-fi works well \u2013 I am writing while in my room, downloading a movie or two. They have BBC on the TV. What more could I ask for. And did I mention I only paid 65 dollars for the place, including taxes.
