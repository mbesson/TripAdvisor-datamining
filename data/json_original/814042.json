{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Perfect for the frugal traveler During my two weeks' trip in Japan I needed a place to stay in Tokyo. A friend of mine tipped me on the Toyoko Inn chain of business hotels: comfortable, clean and easy on the wallet. Booking a room through their website was a breeze.My stay at the Tameike Sanno branch of Toyoko Inn was very pleasant. I made two visits, for a total of three nights. The staff was friendly and we managed to get by in English. Don't expect any luxury though, as the breakfast served is Japanese and quite spartan. Tip: if you're looking for a decent meal, there's a Coco Ichibanya curry restaurant around the corner. Tasty!", "Date": "Jul 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR198199421", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Cailin_Coilleach"}, {"Content": "Great Value I have stayed at Tameike Sanno Toyoko Inn for 6-7 times, each time for 3-4 days. (Once, for two weeks) In addition to the great features of this big business hotel chain (see their website and read reviews for other Toyoko Inn hotels), I like its location- Across from Prime Minister's residence, away from noise and chaos, beautifully renewed subway station one min away (its building has restaurants, bars, delis, convenient stores, Maruzen bookstore for English books, foot massage place, ATMs, and Starbucks) In a word, this neighborhood is much cleaner and sophisticated than those of other Toyoko Inn locations in Tokyo and it's hard to find a hotel of this quality at this price in the area. I will continue staying at Tameike Sanno Toyoko Inn for a few days stop in Tokyo before going to see my family.", "Date": "Dec 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR475386965", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "catsinbrooklyn"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066443-d814042-r18199021-Toyoko_Inn_Tameike_Sanno_Eki_Kantei_Minami-Chiyoda_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "814042", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
