Its not close to town, but only a 15-20min metro ride to Gran Via. The room was spacious, but had one major flaw, the design of the shower. Its about half and inch off the floor, completely flat, with nothing preventing water from spilling out. My wife showered and water was ALL over the bathroom and hallway.

We were pleased that we booked earlier as there were 8 of us going at 7.30 to airport and the reception staff made a point that only people booked in advance would be offered the place. We also booked our room in advance choosing the price with breakfast included. However it turned out that at weekends and on public holidays breakfast would be available from 8 am, there was no chance of even a cup of coffee.The receptionist charged full amount stating that as we chose with breakfast we had to pay for it. Logical? Not a big deal but poor PR for Santos Hotels ,which we had used happily in the past. We had a snack in the Cafe of the hotel in the evening as there are no restaurants around apart from Chinese one. It was ok but pricey for what it was.

When returning to the airport, I took the Maydrit's free shuttle which came on time and took me directly to the terminal in less than 10 minutes. The Maydrit is not on the same Metro line as the airport. It was very easy to take the Metro downtown for a day of sightseeing. However, the trip was about 20 minutes. The Maydrit is not set up for tourists. They have no brochures or maps and although reception desk personnel spoke English, they were not able to give any information (i.e. what time does the Prado open/close on Sunday). So, you must relay on other sources for tourism. The television menu said they had a few english speaking channels such as CNN, but it turned out that was not true.

They have a courtesy van, although it seems as though you can only summon it by calling the hotel directly (i.e. no kiosks at the airport). There are no clocks in the rooms (or alarm clocks or clock radios). I don't think I've experienced this in even a cheap hotel, much less an airport hotel. The hotel, although seemingly empty, was strangely noisy, because for some reason doors of other rooms opening and closing echoed throughout, very loudly. As well, a TV on in one room could be heard in another, apparently because of the echo effects in rooms without carpet. The view is of an overgrown, trash strewn, vacant lot, but the hotel seems to be beside a nice neighborhood area. The only restaurant is understaffed, presumably because the hotel is not much used. It is lit like an army cafeteria, with bright lights. It is very unwelcoming, in that it is so stark. The staff (there was a single person when I was there with a colleague), was nice, but oblivious to the concept of expeditious service. The food was fine. The beds are new and OK, but nothing great. They use the Scandanavian approach of no cover sheet, but rather a sheet-wrapped quilt. If you like that, it's fine. I find it uncomfortable because to regulate your body temperature, you have to either lower the temperature of the room or stick parts of your body out from under, so parts are cold and parts are hot. Bottom line, this hotel has things to offer and things to avoid. The only reason to be here would seem to be an overnight near the airport. My sense is that if it were busier, it would be noisier. A less sparkling or new hotel might be more desirable, but I do not know what the competition is like.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Maydrit Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d1153301-Reviews-Maydrit_Hotel-Madrid.html", "Price": "$72 - $106*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Piragua 1</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28042</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1153301", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e9/e7/20/piscina.jpg"}}
