But I think what really changed the hotel from being a nice, good value hotel in a lovely location to somewhere I know I will never return to was the toilet arrangement. The toilet and shower were behind a glass partition, which didn't reach the ceiling. Not great! I can cope with being on display when on the loo, but hated the idea of stinking out the bedroom. We took to using the downstairs loo if we needed to make a smell, and it seemed quite a few other people were doing that as well. Other than that the hotel staff were very friendly, and the bed was AMAZING!! We ended up sleeping in on both occasions. The breakfast was delicious and there was a massive choice. And the location was pretty good, a wee bit out of town, but we hired bikes and could be at Leidesplein within 10 mins, and the tram from there was even quicker. So overall if you can handle the bathroom situation I would recommend this hotel. As we couldn't I won't be going back.

The hotel is modern and the rooms are quite comfortable and luminous. The bed is amazing and the pillows are very comfy as well. We were disappointed with the bathrooms (are almost incorporated in the bedroom, only separated by a glass wall): the shower didn't have a curtain so it got the whole bathroom wet and there wasn't a fan to take odour out so the whole bedroom would stink after using the WC. Also, the lighting was a bit poor, especially if you like reading a book at night. There were some minor maintenance issues as well, like water leakage from the window, ripped carpet, and clogged sink, but were fixed quickly. Breakfast is delicious and in winter they have a especial for 13 euros, which is very convenient since it has everything you need to keep you full for hours (eggs, croissants, salmon, bacon, cappuccino/hot chocolate, cereal, fruits, etc). There is no restaurant in the hotel to have dinner, the bar only serves tapas and they are very expensive, so just walk a couple of blocks and go to \"Tapa Feliz\" or \"Serdegna\" where they serve great food for a very good price.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSmall rooms but comfortable\u201d", "Author": "ctanski", "ReviewID": "UR123864643", "Content": "We took the train in Amsterdam to the main station, then took a tram from the station, it stops directly infront of the hotel.

In keeping with the artsy decor of the lobby, the hotel is only a 15 minute walk from the museum district, or you can take the number 2 tram, and continue all the way through the city center to the Central Station. We booked through Hotels.com, and unfortunately, they did not show the breakfast plan which was available by booking directly through the hotel. At first the price of the breakfast buffet seemed expensive, but if you drink 3 or 4 cups of coffee at breakfast like I do, and given the 3+ Euros per cup which most restaurants in Amsterdam charge (without refills), than it probably pays for itself. My only objection to this hotel was the so-called coffee maker which they advertise in the rooms. It turned out to be nothing more than a hot water heater with packets of instant coffee.

Our rooms were the same - both clean and had everything we needed for a 48hour trip - tea,coffee,info books on Amsterdam and a very clean bathroom - the glass door is not as bad as i expected as it was round the corner from the bed/desk area!

On are last evening - after being extremely knackered we ate in the bar - this was great - very stylish and again the staff lovely. The menu was basic - burgers/chips etc but im sure when the main restaurant is open there is more choice! Amsterdam is a crazy city - it seemed even busier as it was new year - 24 hour fire works - some beautiful and some dangerous - bangers going off next to our feet down every street, as long as you kept an eye out it was ok - funny really ( if in england it would have been classed as a riot) police were cool about the situation. Personally we all loved our trip - being young enjoying the bars/coffee shops and shopping (although most shops closed new years day which was a shame as us 2 girls had decided that would be our main shopping day)! We walked alot to find our way around but when we did take the tram it was very easy 1,2 or 5 (not 125 that we first thought haha) took us back to the hotel and it was about 12 minutes.

Not knowing this part of the city and reading varying reviews we did not know what to expect. The hotel is located about 15mins fom the centre by tram number 2 that runs to Central station. The best thing to do if you are there for a few days and the weather is not too good is to get a daily or 2 day tram card which is good value and you dont have to worry about always having cash on hand as no journey is less than 2.60 euros no matter how short.yes the trams can get crowded but they are ferquent and as long as you are careful with your belongings, as in any other major city ,it is the ideal way to get about . We had an executive room with views of the park.The bed was huge and the walk in bathroom is in a glass cubicle so it is quite unique.Shower is good and there are bathrobes and slippers. In the room there is also a nespresso machine but I prefer a kettle.My only criticism is there is only 1 small mirror in the bathroom but i mentioned this at reception and hopefully this will be sorted in the future.Sometimes the housekeeping was a little strange and no tea and coffee was left and sometimes only 2 towels and 1 bathrobe but this was immediately sorted with a call to reception. The reception staff were lovely and friendly and offered advice when it was needed. Our deal included breakfast which was excellent and varied with quality ingredients and lovely bread and pastries as well as a hot section,fruit and yoghurt and even smoked salmon. The decor of the reception and bar is modern but comfortable and everywhere is spotlessly clean. I wouldnt recommend the hotel for dsiabled guests as there are 2 seperate buildings and a number of steps.There is no evening restaurant in the hotel but bar snacks are available and there are restaurants within a 5 min walk. I would recommend the hotel for a nice city break in a safe area with pleasant staff and nice bar and breakfast room.Any one that can find a better hotel for the price at this time of year would be lucky and hopefully the next time we visit the city we will be able to stay at the Park Plaza Vondelpark.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suffolk", "Title": "\u201cGreat place\u201d", "Author": "alanandcaz", "ReviewID": "UR121697675", "Content": "We were more than happy with this hotel, set away from the hussle and bustle of the centre, which is easily accessible using the nearby tram stop.

The mini-fridge was another welcome surprise. I gather from reading other reviews that we were fortunate to have had such a pleasant room--some of the others sound deplorable. Staff were enthusiastic and welcoming. After calling reception to ask whether an iron was available, I was surprised by a knock on our door within 5 minutes: not housekeeping staff, but the actual reception agent herself, iron and board in hand. We appreciated the proximity to the tram stop (Emmastraat) and the village-like feel of the neighborhood. Being a few minutes' tram ride from the center was not a negative for us. Would have loved exploring the park, but a lot of rain and too little time made that impossible. A propos of the rain, sloshing around in it all day long made the hotel bar area with its gas fireplace a cozy retreat in the evening. We also enjoyed the hotel breakfast--quite extensive, in my opinion, and presented in a comfortable, colorful atmosphere. The setup made for good traffic flow around the various stations, a feature which we also found to be somewhat unique. I had one negative comment to make upon checking out, which concerned a spot of mildew in the corner where wall met tub. It got a little worse every day we were there, and was maybe size of a US quarter coin after 3 nights. The desk agent made note of the room number and indicated it would be addressed immediately. Even realizing we may have had one of the few large, bright rooms in the hotel, I would still recommend this property and will stay there again without hesitation.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for seeing Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "HJCLondon", "ReviewID": "UR118063821", "Content": "We had a wonderful weekend at the hotel.

The replacement room in the annexe was certainly more superior and was both peaceful, spacious and comfortable. However there were no real tea bags supplied with the kettle and we had to request further shower gel on the second day. Why wasnt this automatically replaced? The washbasin was situated in the bedroom itself and its surrounding wood was both warped and the veneer surface was missing in places.

Tram #2 goes directly down Koninginneweg, the stop for Emmastraat / Koningslaan is closest to the hotel, I believe. Our room was not in the main building, but in the building next door.

The hotel is maybe a ten to fifteen minute walk to the Van Gogh Museum, and a little bit longer to Leidesplein where all the restaurants are. We walked everywhere, even to the Anne Frank House, but we did take the tram when returning to the hotel (lots of rain!).

My concern was justified when we checked in and were shown to our room. The carpet had disgusting big stains all over which was not acceptable. We asked to be moved, and were given another room, again with stains but smaller ones this time. We were in a triple room and the staff said there are not many of these at the hotel, so we accepted the room as the best available. The rooms are generally a bit scruffy and in need of TLC. Only a single rather lumpy pillow is provided and the duvets were similarly very lumpy and uneven. The brochure we had booked through rated this hotel as 4 star which one would hope would feel at least a little bit luxurious, but sadly no. I got the impression from reading on this site that the new block is perhaps better - we were in the old block. All the carpets in the corridors are also stained really badly and I did not feel the general standard of cleanliness throughout was that good. There seemed to be no attention to detail at all. All seemed a bit soul-less and unloved. You just sort of got the impression no-one really cared about the place or the standards. The bar and breakfast room are very trendy (my kids loved them) but it is very superficial and certainly the rooms we were in were not modern or trendy. We were also woken at 4.30 a.m. by the TV switching on automatically and were surprised to find at breakfast that the TV in my parents' room down the corridor (we were having a 3-generation trip!) had also switched on at the same time. When we enquired at the desk we were told it must have been an incorrectly programmed wake-up call. They were not at all apologetic though. In the main the staff were helpful but you did feel they perhaps were good at dealing with complaints because they got a lot of them. Very noisy at night - the doors bang so if anyone was checking out early then it woke me up. Disturbed more than once each night. On the plus side - nice breakfast with lots of choice. Overall - if it had been cheaper or rated lower, would probably have thought it not so bad - but having booked it as supposedly very modern, 4 star then could not fail to be disappointed.

The hotel is very clean and modernly designed, and located in a nice and quite neighborhood near the park and not far from the city center. However, as for the service - this is not a 4-star hotel at all. To begin with, we had to take our luggage ourselves to the room - to get there we had to pass through a steep staircase until the elevator. The room itself was extremely uncomfortable. The bathroom and bedroom were in fact a one space - highly inconvenient for a couple. Furthermore, there was no mirrors in the room (other then one tiny mirror inside the closet), and the sink was situated outside the so called bathroom. when we got to Amsterdam it was already cold at night, however the central heat system was still set to summer mode, meaning that it was quite cold in the room. On top of that, we were equipped with two single and relatively thin quilts, although the room was ordered for a couple. It took us 3 days before we got a descent quilt, and the heat system was not set to heat the room throughout our stay, even though we asked for it repeatedly. And to top that, the hotel staff lost one of my girlfriend's shoes!! When we approached the hotel staff with that issue, nobody believed us. It got to the point where the hotel manager itself accused us of having an unusually untidy room, and that the shoe must be inside the room. When we checked out we insisted to be compensated in some manner, and about an hour after we left I received a phone call from the manager that the shoe has been found. The manager promised to send the shoe to our next destination via express mail, however, the shoe had reached that destination only 8 days after we left Amsterdam - we were already back home by then, causing us further inconvenience in our attempts to get the shoe back.

All the rooms seem to have a smallish bathroom with a shower and a toilet. Note, the sink is on the OUTSIDE of the bathroom. This leaves no privacy for doing your personal hygiene stuff, you are inside the hotel room itself and it would feel awkward for me if sharing the room with another person. The products supplied are not many - a bar of soap, body lotion, shampoo and body wash, all of average quality. The aircon worked well, but was of the kind which never shut off and was constantly on. The thermostat was not correct, when set to 25C it was about 20C but you can work your way around that by just setting a higher temperature than you require. If opening the window please be aware that there can be some noise from the goings-on outside, there are some restaurants and bars in the area and sometimes some noise from people leaving these, you may also find that the tram trundling past creates noise which may prevent you from sleeping. However, when closing the window I heard no sounds from outside. No minibar, but they do supply a small fridge. Safe. Internet access in-room expensive, but free in the lobby. No ironing boards/iron, but you can request these from housekeeping. BREAKFAST is of average quality, but the standard varies. Sometimes the croissants were burnt, and sometimes there was no fresh bread. Some items were not available on some dais, so it's clear the selection of items varies. The scrambled eggs were obviously steamed and tasted a bit odd, but the bacon and sausages were fine. Otherwise, there are standard breakfast items like (mature) cheese, a few different types of ham, chorizo, and salami. Few items suitable for vegetarians. There is also youghurt, fruit salad, cerals, and of course hot and cold drinks. A nice touch was that they provided fresh mint leaves for making tea. LOCATION This hotel is not centrally located. However, it's right next to a big park, which is great for a stroll or a jog in the morning. It is also very near the Emmastraat tram stop. However it's a good 15-20 minutes on the tram going into town. Taxis rarely pass by outside so you can't just step outside and grab a taxi, but they can call one for you and they are usually very quick to arrive. SERVICE This is the only hotel I have ever stayed at which seem to have what amounts to a Service Level Agreement. Maybe it's not that formal, but when requesting something they will tell you that it will be available \"within X minutes\". They stand by their word, if you request an ironing board and they say it will be within 10 minutes or less, that is what will happen. The staff is obviously dedicated and very accommodating if you need something. In fact, when there were no taxis available the staff took two of my colleagues in a private car and drove them to their destination - saving my colleagues a very long wait for a taxi. That shows dedication. Note, there is NO room service at this hotel. Also there is NO laundry service on a Saturday - even though the piece of paper you fill in for your laundry indicates this is available, for a 50% surcharge.

It is just behind the Vondelpark, which is a 15 minute walk to the leidseplein (a buzzing part of Amsterdam with loads of eating/drinking places). Alternatively you can take tram 2 into the town centre/central station. The Vondelpark was always buzzing, even at 12-1 am, when walking back to the hotel, which was good to still feel safe even at that time of night. If you like live music, there are several jazz clubs in the city centre which are really good. When paying the bill in the hotel we had to pay tourist tax which was 10euros. The Wifi is very expensive in the hotel and there's no free points in the hotel. However if you go to Hardrock cafe (in leidseplein) there is free wifi there!

Our room was on the 4th floor and spacious. The bathrooms were clean as well and the housekeeping staff were very friendly and efficient. The beds are fairly comfortable (the same can't really be said for the pillows) and we appreciated plopping down in front of the flat screen TV after a full day of walking around the city.

The rooms are pleasant and comfy with good equipment (including free Nespresso coffee machines, flat screen tvs with a good number of english channels and modern decor). There is a problem which some people would find unacceptable; the bathrooms have transparent, see-through walls so if you will be sharing with someone that you would be embarrassed to see (or hear!!) you using the toilet or shower, I would look elsewhere. The lobby is a little less impressive but still good, with friendly staff and a free internet computer. The rooms are individually designed as the first room we were allocated had a double bed whereas we needed twins and the second room had a totally different floor plan and layout. The twin beds themselves were not that great as they are just single beds. The location of the hotel is pretty good, in a nice quiet residential district on the edge of the city centre about 2 miles south of the train station (which is the at the heart of the city) and a 20 minute walk west of the Van Gough museum and the Rijks museum.

We booked 2 superior doubles, and were allowed to check in 2 and 1/2 hours early which we were pleased about. However, it was only after our friends contacted reception as their light switch was hanging off the wall and they were subsequently moved to a 'superior room' that we realised we had been given standard ones initially. Our friends had to argue their case to change rooms as reception were not happy to move them, so we decided to grin and bear ours. The bathroom situation is pretty undignified, and only the centre section is frosted, leaving very little to the imagination. There is also a large gap at the top of the glass, which allows bathroom noises etc to be fully heard! Not exactly suitable for a romantic break, and pretty humiliating for your other half! Our room was on the 4th floor, and there does seem to be a foul smell of drains/mould permeating throughout, which never really went away. The towels were changed regularly, and overall the beds and facilities were fine. This hotel is easily walkable to Leidesplein, where we chose to head for New Year, but would be a struggle for Dam Square etc as the trams stopped at 8pm. Having been to Amsterdam before and stayed at the Bellevue which was great, I would say that overall this hotel is average, and would probably be fine if travelling solo, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it to a new couple or those who value their dignity!

In reception I confirmed that we had booked a double bed, they had no record of this so I pulled out my email to confirm their response. We got to our room which which was in the building next door to the main reception and found that it was a twin, I took us back down to reception and requested another room, we then went up to this which was in the building adjacent to reception, this room did have a double bed but reeked of block drains, back down again to reception, the duty manager then personally took me to another 2 rooms and I was upgraded to the business suite which was absolutely fantastic, I have to say that getting a double bed was an issue and when you do get one there are 2 twin duvets on the bed, according to the manager this is throughout the hotel. Despite requesting room changes the management were friendly and professional throughout and fantastically accomodating. I do think this had a lot to do with the fact that I had proof that they had let me down initially. So my advise is that if you do confirm anything via email print it off.

Had one of the executive suites which was located in the building next door, these are probably quite different from the rooms in the main building. The room was large by European standards, and yes we had the frosted glass wall separating the bathroom from the rest of the room. Can't say it bothered us particularly but I can understand why some would find it a little offputting as very little is left to the imagination. The water pressure was excellent, and it's probably the most powerful shower I've come across in our travels around Europe. The tub, while not jetted, was a very nice size. Nice firm bed, it was two twins pushed together though. Don't get too excited by the cooler you'll find in these suites, they aren't particularly effective and if you want to chill your drinks you'll be needing ice, which you get direct from the bar when it's open, otherwise the front desk staff will get it for you, to my knowledge there are no ice making machines. The breakfast was included in our hotel rate, and is nothing special, but is an OK way to fill up for the morning. If you leave it too late though you may find that the selection of warm food is limited...and even then the warm stuff isn't exactly piping hot. I have nothing but praise for the front desk staff, any questions we had were answered in a very friendly and efficient manner, and we were always greeted with a smile. One note of caution, when you arrive at the hotel you will notice the only way in is via a couple of staircases which is a bit of a pain when lugging suitcases around. Location wise if you plan to walk to the attractions this hotel is not very convenient. I would guess it's about a 20 - 30 mins walk to the main museums, which is fine if the weather is good, but not so fine if it's cold and wet. It would be a good idea to master the tram system as the number 2 tram runs pass the hotel, the nearest stop is less than 5 mins away. Bear in mind though that if you plan on staying out late, the trams finish up quite early, then you'll be looking at the expensive taxis. The area around the hotel is very residential and you will find a few restaurants/shops in some of the surrounding streets, overall though it is very quiet.

We had a superior twin room, apparently, although I think this actually wasn't the case. The hotel is located a short 2 minute walk from the tram stop at Emmastraat, which is served by tram 2. Or, if you walk to the other side of Emmastraat, you can catch the line 16. The trams are generally every 10 minutes throughout the day. Beware, if you need to be at central station early on a Sunday morning to catch the train to Schipol, the first tram then is at 07:05. We had a rush to make it for our 8 a.m. check-in! Check-in is strictly at 2 pm. We arrived slightly early and waited in the comforatable lounge area, where we watched the Flintstones on the TV. The lifts in the hotel are small, but being on the 2nd floor (actually the 1st floor as far as I could tell - it was the florr above reception!) we hardly used it apart from taking luggage up to the room and bringing it back down again. There is a computer with internet access, but this is generally taken, whatever time of the day or night (even at 2 a.m.!) you try, so I would suggest you bring your own laptop and take advantage of the free wireless internet. The room was very small with 2 single beds next to each other. So near to each other they were touching. As two friends travelling together, we had to rearrange the room slightly so that we weren't essentially \"sharing a bed\". The beds were comfortable with one pillow and a duvet. The room had a bowl of fruit and two bottles of water, which was a nice tough. There was also a kettle with a selection of teas and coffees. The hot drinks were topped up sporadically over our stay, although the maid for some reason seems to think that I like earl grey, as she kept leaving more and more of it, even though I never touched it! The TV in the room is wall-mounted and the main channels of interest to an English-speaker are BBC, BBC2 and Comedy Central. It is a little high on the wall, however, and you do end up with a crick in your neck from watching it. The air conditioning is a godsend and was lovely after a long day sightseeing in the clammy heat! The bathroom has a frosted glass door, so make sure you're aware that people in your room could see you sitting on the toilet! Shampoo, showel gel, body lotion, soap, etc are provided should you need them. The towels were replaced every day if needed. The shower had a gap down the middle of the door which meant that the bathroom floor was permanently swimming in water. The whole 11 day stay, the bed linen was not changed once. The pillow was plumped and the duvet folded, but the actual duvet cover, pillow case and sheet were left. The hotel is 2 minutes walk from Vondelpark, which is a must. Check out the free classical concerts on a Sunday afternoon. You can reach Leidseplein in 7 minutes on the tram and Centraal Station in 14. There are lots of restaurants near the hotel on Emmastraat and Willems Parkweg, but we didn't try them, preferring instead to eat near Leidseplein. Be aware that if you are out late at night, the last tram is around 00:30 and after that the night buses takes over. If you take the night bus, I would suggest the 358 and getting off at Museumplein, which is the nearest stop to the hotel (and a 12-15 minute walk at that, but it's a very safe area). If you decided to get a taxi from Centraal Station / Damrak / REd Light area, expect to pay around 14 euros at least....", "Date": "August 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devon", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location\u201d", "Author": "Pickywitch", "ReviewID": "UR37146813", "Content": "Hotel is situated in a quiet upmarket residential area a short tram ride to the main attractions, trams are every 10 minutes or so and the nearest stop is less than 5 minutes walk from the hotel.

Amsterdam is an expensive city, moreso due to the poor GBP - Euro exchange rate (a pint of Heineken and a pint of lemonade was over 10Euros!) and finding a reasonably priced hotel was tricky. Vondelpark Park Plaza fitted the bill. We arrived in Amsterdam by train and purchased a stripenkaarten at a newsagent at the Station Centraal. Taking tram 2, we alighted at Emmastraat, the nearest tram stop to the hotel, and walked the 100metres or so to the hotel. We were warmly welcomed at the hotel and our luggage deposited at the left luggage room as we had arrived before check-in. We took a walk into the city centre, walking as far as Leidsplein, which took around 30mins at a reasonable pace (so i assume that Station Centraal would have been another 15-20mins walk). Plus points about our room + satellite tv (although limited channels) + comfortable bed (two twins pushed together, which allowed us to feel that we were not in the same bed) with comfortable pillows and douvet + window that opened + clean Negative points - ineffective air conditioning (minimum temperature of 18C) - excessive street noise due to tram line outside window (trams run from around 6am to just after midnight) - poor blackout effect from curtains - ineffectual double glazing We did not eat in the hotel restaurant for any meals. There is a computer for guest use in the hotel lobby, but neither of us made use of this, so I am unsure of any expense to utilise it. With regards amsterdam, it is possible to book tickets for many museums online (including the Anne Frank, Van Gogh and Heineken museums) which is recommended as the queues can be lengthy to purchase tickets, especially at the Van Gogh museum. We did not eat at any recommendation worthy restaurants during my trip, but did make use of the supermarkets (Albert Heijn) for purchasing cold beers, soft drinks, snacks and items for picnics. Stripenkaarten are also available at the tobacco kiosks in the supermarkets. The red light district made for an interesting evening stroll / window shopping, although there was more than just an occasional suspicious character hanging around, so I would only take essential items, avoid taking bags and keep things in front pockets. With regards stripenkaarten, they cost 7.30Euros for 15 strips and provide better value for money than buying individual tickets for each trip. To use the public transport it costs one strip plus one strip for every zone you are travelling in (eg travel within one zone costs 2 strips per person, travel within 2 zones costs 3 strips, etc). 2 strips gets you around most of amsterdam on all forms of public transport (metro, trams and buses), including from Station Centraal to Emmastraat, and can be used throughout the country, as we managed to use it in Eindhoven at the end of our trip. Multiple people can use the same stripenkaarten as long as the appropriate number of strips have been stamped for each person travelling (ie 4 strips for 2 people travelling within zone 1). The strips allow you unlimited travel within that zone using as many forms of public transport as necessary for a 1 hour period.

This is a great hotel if you're on a budget, or even if you're not, and staying for some time. You get the nice, quiet streets after a hard day of sight-seeing and noise. Skip the breakfast or any food the hotel serves. There's a fantastic supermarket with everything you will need only a 7-minute walk away. Also, great restaurants on that same street that will do take-away. Get some groceries and some salads, etc. at the take-out places and store them in the mini-bar. A good plus is that you can check your email and surf the web in the hotel lobby for free. The hotel lobby will also arrange for transportation service to the airport or call a cab.", "Date": "January 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Sussex", "Title": "\u201cLove this hotel\u201d", "Author": "Fuzzo68", "ReviewID": "UR22611830", "Content": "This is a great hotel, with the tram stopping right outside you are in a great location away from the hustle & bustle.

If you want to walk through the Vondel Park there is also a cafe next to the film museum that serves breakfast.

The hotel staff was extremely accomodating and everything was clean! We booked a double room and were initially given 2 beds. When we called the front desk to move us to a room with one bed, they did so without hesitation and upgraded us to an executive suite. That's always a plus! The only weird thing, which I had read on other review sites, is that the executive suite has a very non-private bathroom. True! There is no door that actually closes you off from hearing and partially seeing your suitemate use the facilities. Not my thing. Apart from that the beds were very comfortable which can be a hard thing to find in Europe, in my experience. The staff was always attentive and quick. I paid 100 Euro per night on average for the time we were there though that didn't include breakfast. We were happier eating out in whatever cafe we found. so I don't know how the food was there.

Be advised there are two small draw backs with regards to this hotel. The location is not central so there is little to do in the evening. If you want to go out you have to go to the city centre. It is easy by tram but trhe trams stop running at midnight so you need a cab to go back and they can be difficult to obtain at night. Second, acces to the lobby is not easy.

The entrace door is 5 stairs above the ground and you have to carry your baggage up to the stairs (no ramps or elevators, etc.). The first thing that i noticed when i entered the lobby: the horrible smell of cigarrates, which was always present both in the lobby and the hallways (even the hallways of non-smoking floors). the receptionist lady was nice and helpful. there was free wireless interent in the lobby but not in all the rooms. i asked to see if they had a room with wireless access and i was told that the rooms on the second floor had wireless, so i asked to be moved to the second floor and after 20 minutes of wait, they gave me a room with wireless access on the second floor. it was worth the wait. my room was facing the main street infront of the hotel and was terribly noisy. i could hear the cars and the tram passing by all evening. also, the doors of the rooms didn't have slam stoppers so each time anyone closed a door, you would hear a big slam, day and night which was very annoying. the bathroom was renovated and nice and clean although very small which was ok for me. the room was clean although the carpet was not new and had some spots on it. there was no iron in the room and i had to ask the reception to give ma an iron and ironing board. there was no fridge or microwave in the room. Not even an alarm clock so i had to request wake-up calls from the reception. So, overall, i would say that the hotel was quite average if it didn't have the noise problems but with all the noise, i have to say that it was a bit below average. There was a shuttle to and from the airport which costed 13.5 each way. to get to the airport from the hotel you could book the shuttle 2 hours before your departure time. it was a very good option.

Also, the hotel had one public computer in the lobby for guests use. The room was typically small twin bed in the European style. When we walked in it did have a funky mildew smell to it although it looked nice. the room did have a bathroom and a shower although it was unlike anything I had seen before. The bathroom and shower were enclosed in a frosted glass next to the bed and there was about a 3 foot gap between the top of the glass and ceiling. Nothing horrible, however if you shared the room with someone it is not that private. Didn't eat in the hotel because it was $16 euros for breakfast when you could make a right out of the hotel and go to the bakery a hundred yards down on the opposite side of the street for a much cheaper option. There was a vending machine near the elevators which ahd candy and sodas for $1 euro a piece. Getting around Amsterdam was easy because the #2 tram Emmasraat stop was about 50 yards from the front of the hotel and the museum square area was about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The only drawback was that the tram stopped running after midnight however there are night buses that run on the main street just south of the hotel and stop at Emmastraat.

It was also quite a reasonable rate for Amsterdam. Arrived in Amsterdam from Toronto at 6am on a Saturday. We had requested early check-in, and I was very skeptical that we would get, but to our delight, our room was ready. The one thing that did stand out to me was that as we entered the front lobby of the hotel, there was an overwhelming stench of urine, however it must have been dealt with shortly thereafter, because that was the one and only incidence. Based on others' reviews and tales of small, stuffy rooms and poor air circulation, we had also requested a room with AC in the 'new' or 'renovated' part of the hotel, which again, to my surprise, we were granted - and the AC worked wonders. The room itself was TINY! (Rm.526). A double bed pushed in the corner and about 2-3 feet to walk around it on either side. But we were not planning to spend much time there anyway. No complaints about the washroom - small, but not terribly tiny - excellent amenities - modern, clean, good water pressure, good hair dryer and a mirror spanning one entire wall of the washroom. (Girls, the corridors of the hotel have full-length mirrors up and down them as part of the decor, so I would sometimes pop into the hall for that final outfit check!). Mattress was a bit hard (my husband complained about a sore back), but not terrible... we definitely had a number of good night sleeps! Overall, it was better than I was expecting and we were happy to return to the Park Plaza for the final 2 nights of our stay in Amsterdam! Location is good - very quiet, but definitely not central. We had perfect spring weather so we chose to walk a lot, but that is also a great way to explore the city. It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseums; 30 minutes to the Leidseplein. The hotel backs onto Vondel Park, so we also got to explore this beautiful, picturesque park. We enjoyed our walks, but it was also easy to jump on the tram (#2) to take you to the Centre. We did this to go to Central Station one day, then made our way back through the city, ie. through the Red Light District, etc. I think I would stick with this location next time, maybe a tad closer to the centre would be nice, but the peace and quiet was just right.

We ended up booking the park plaza through expedia after a lot of to and from with booking sites offering unbelieveable deal on the 5* hotels in AMS that were then not available due to 'technical issues'...... Getting there: Having read reviews about the taxis being a ripoff, we decided on using public transport. it took a while to figure out and we eventually made it to the hotel after going via the central station. Despite speaking/reading German it wasn't that obvious how to get there, but various passers by were able to give direction in English. In hindsight, I think I'd just negotiate a deal with a cab at the airport as the trains took at least 90 mins by the time we figured them out and did everything we needed to. By contrast the cab back took 15 mins!!! Location: The hotel itself is in a great part of town, right next to the Vondelpark and in easy walking distance of some top spots for breakfast or if you want to eat on the hoof, theres a beautiful patisserie about 10 mins away (walk 2 tram stops back towards town, turn right and keep going - patisserie is on the right - theres also a launderette and a chemist around there). Its an upmarket area, quiet and clean. Rooms: We got a room the far end of the hotel #351 - that is to say we were in the building furthest from town. \"Good enough\" would be the summary I'd give them. The bathroom did it's job, towels were clean, shower worked well, even if a bit temperamental about whether to run hot or cold! The hair dryer was a bit puny (girls, bring your own if you want dry hair). The decor was rather..... orange...refurb needed in terms of style but in upkeep it was OK. You get a teeny telly, who cares about TV when you're on holiday though. The mini bar was empty, but again, who cares - you're on hols, go to a bar if you want a drink! One gripe that I share with other reviews is that the beds are singles pushed together so not exactly comfortable if you want to curl up together of a night. The other moan with the beds is a common one in European hotels - the pillows are useless and you only get one. We requested extras (3 times) and got them immediately after snapping at reception on the phone. Service: apart from having to ask several times for extra pillows, they were great. I bought a huge Vanda orchid in the flower market which they put in a safe spot for me when we left our luggage. We were able to borrow umbrellas from them for no charge - just as well since it pee'd down when we were there. Local knowledge was good, directions accurate. nothing to complain about really. General things: Don't bother with the airport shuttle, it didn't show up for us either - we got a cab to take us both back for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25 so that was a lot better. Not the hotels fault, but worth a mention. Public transport is great in AMS, we went all over the place on the trams and by buying the strip tickets it was a doddle to hop on and off, not that we ever worked out the charging, but at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.50 a strip we weren't fussed. Most of the time we just walked around and soaked it all up. The town itself can be a bit confusing to get around so pickup a decent map from somewhere. Coffee shops - actually its not so easy to find one that just sells coffee. Most of them are full of smokers! if thats what you want, you'll be spoiled for choice all over town. If you want a sit down coffee and cake experience, you'll need to keep your eyes peeled a bit more! might seem an odd statement, but thats how we found it. Red Light District: an odd place and well worth a visit even if just to satisfy your curiosity. Keep your guard up, your purse closed and your wallet in tight pockets - you know you're being watched by the pickpockets and 'unsavoury characters'. Night time is most interesting as you can wander through the groups egging each other on, the blind drunk moaning that they wasted \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 as they couldn't perform and watch the girls working hard to draw in the punters (competition is strong so they'l put on a performance). Canal trips: We did a day one as the heavens opened upon us and wished we'd done the night trip too. Due to where we were in town at the time we ended up on the TUI one right by the main station. there was commentary in english and they tell you a lot of facts. Quite interesting all in all. Crossing the road: Good luck! between trams, \"psycholists\" as we ended up naming them, and cars, crossing the road is a lottery. The bikes were the worst as you don't hear them coming - stop, look, listen! Diamonds: Interesting to visit the diamond workers/show, but don't buy from them. You're paying extra for the nice show they put on for the hundreds of others who don't buy anything. Gassan was the most interesting and they show you some stunning stones. We were shown a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac92,000 2carat rock and even I, who is not jewellery minded was drawn to it. They offer a shuttle bus service and the reception in the hotel will hand you a leaflet Enjoy amsterdam, its a very cool city :o)", "Date": "May 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Horsham Sussex", "Title": "\u201cTerrible room\u201d", "Author": "passwordprotected", "ReviewID": "UR7555359", "Content": "Our room was small and incredibly dated.

Upon arrival, the customer service, while attempting to be helpful, had a very curt mannerism. Despite this, we were told that we had been \"upgraded\" to the \"residential building\" which is right next door to the hotel. This turned out to be a pleasant suprise... Rooms: The room was very nice. The only American channel provided on the TV was MTV, but you don't go to Amsterdam to sit in front of the TV. Unfortunately, the double bed is just two twin beds pushed together (as others have mentioned). While we encountered this in other hotels, Vondel Park Plaza seemed to be a little worse because for some reason the bed was more mobile than the others, and the twin beds were easily seperated. This was the first time that my husband had to wake up in the middle of the night to push the beds back together. The bathrooom was also very nice with a seperate tub and shower. However, the outlet in the bathroom was not able to support the adapter so we ended up having to use the desk outlets so we could place a book underneath the adapter to support the weight. So for all you curling iron users - be prepared to curl your hair at the desk without a mirror! We stayed in Room #1 in the residential building and it is a nice room - definitely recommended. Location: Vondel Park Plaza is in a quiet, safe residential area. The tram stop \"Emmastraat\" is a five minute walk from the hotel and runs from about 5am-1245am. It costs about 1.60 euro each way per a person to get to city center. The Van Gogh museum and Richt Museum are within walking distance (about 15 mins). Also: There is a bar/resteraunt with a lounge and fireplace near the reception desk. There is one computer with free internet for use BUT it is stone aged and very slow. Despite some nusances - I recommend this hotel because it is a nice location (I would not stay right in city center) and a good value. Tips on Amsterdam: Anne Frank house and Van Gogh museum is a must see! The canal rides are lovely (8 euros/pp) - but make sure you do a night one. My husband and I did it during the day and we both concluded that it would have been more lovely at night.

It seems nothing in Amsterdam is cheap and after months of trying to lowball Priceline for a 4-5 star hotel, I finally upped my bid price and dropped a level in quality which is how I ended-up with 4 rooms at the Vondel Park Plaza. Part of my disappointment is due to my own stupidity, aka cheapness, in deciding to haul our suitcases from Schiphol to Central Station via the train. From there we had to wrestle or bags over cobblestones and tram tracks to catch the #2 tram which took us eventually to within just a few feet of the hotel. Neither the train nor the tram are conducive to this type of activity - nowhere to safely put your bags so you're stuck standing next to them the whole way. It was another hassle dragging the bags up 7-8 steps (no handicap ramp) to the hotel entrance. Inside, the lobby is rather small but clean and comfortable. The staff was very professional and helpful. In fact , even though it was only 10:30 am when we showed-up, we were given rooms. And we were assured that even if the rooms hadn't been ready, the hotel would let us leave our bags while we spent the rest of the day sightseeing. The rooms were on the 4th floor but two elevators made access easy. The rooms were on the quiet back side of the hotel, overlooking the park. The rooms themselves weren't anything special, and were actually rather small. But they were clean and in good repair. My single bed wasn't as firm as I would like nor was the comforter anywhere near as plush as most, but I still ended-up well-rested. The bathrooms were small, but the plumbing worked well with plenty of hot water and strong shower flow. I might have called this hotel above average had they thrown in a free breakfst, or if it were closer to the Damrak area or if the rooms were spectacular. I found nothing particularly wrong with the place but two years ago I paid $20 a night less for rooms at the Amsterdam Renaissance which was an infinitely classier establishment.

Didn't have breakfast at the hotel, went to nearby Leidisplein for this where you will find a plentiful supply of restaurants and bars. Tram is only 2 minutes walk from hotel and will take you through Leidisplein and all stops past Dam Square to the Central Station. I would advise getting the'STRIP' pass for the trams, well worth the money(you can purchase this at the ticket office across from the Central Station for around 11 Euros)I have to admit that we walked almost everywhere without a problem, just watchout for the Bike riders, they take no prisoners.

Avoid the breakfast at all costs unless it is included in your room rate as it is not worth the money.
