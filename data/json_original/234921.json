We were in a huge room with four single beds. Our room was clean and had lovely white bedding. We always strip the beds when we are leaving and the mattress and pillows were spotless. The breakfast is very good with plenty of choice. The location is great across the road is Charlottenburg S-Bahn station, which once we got the hang off the time table it was great. We bought the tickets from the hotel reception, the staff were brilliant and very helpful one night we decided to have a drink in our room and decided we would like some nibbles it was about 10.00 we went to the little bar that is in the hotel and was told they did not have any but with in 30mins the room phone rung and they had got us some which was really nice. The only thing that I did not like was the shower it was lovely and warm but you had to step up in to it which was quite high and when getting out it became very slippery we would go back here again. And It was great value for money.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eindhoven, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff, comfortable hotel\u201d", "Author": "supersharma", "ReviewID": "UR122171021", "Content": "Located right next to the Charlottenburg S-Bahn station, as many have noted, this little hotel is worth the money you spend on it. My wife and I stayed here for three nights and loved it. The first day, we were given a room with separate beds even though we'd asked for a room with a double bed. But they apologised for their mistake and, the very next morning, put us in a huge room with a king-size bed. Our room was very clean and well-maintained. The breakfast is standard and decent. And the owner (I presume) is a really nice lady who was really helpful and cheerful (perhaps due to Christmas?). The location is great. Berlin's main station is a couple of S-Bahn stops from here while Kurfurstendamm is less than a kilometre away. You can also get to important locations like Alexanderplatz, Potsdamer Platz and Friedrichstrasse very easily. You can buy day tickets for public transport, as well as the Berlin Welcome card, at the hotel reception itself. Very close to the hotel, there are Turkish eateries open till midnight or so. Also, there's a 24-hour supermarket on Lewishamstrasse (a few metres away) that seems to be owned by Russians and you can get everything (except decent chips/crisps) there. I would go back here again. Great value for money. It's in a calm place but you can easily get to the hustle and bustle of Berlin Mitte.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "h\u00f6rby", "Title": "\u201cWe\u00b4ll come back again! :-)\u201d", "Author": "acquarius_69", "ReviewID": "UR116690233", "Content": "Charming little hotel, nice & friendly staff and reception 24h/day.

It is very very convenient with the S-Bahn station (You can get almost anywhere on it.) across the street and the 109 airport bus at the corner, and a busy taxi stand at the same corner. My room was very clean and had a cable t.v. and telephone. Husband and wife owners are warm, friendly, very helpful and eager to please within reason, of course. Because there is no elevator, they helped me up the stairs with my luggage. I requested a quiet room with bath and toilette in the room (cheaper rates are available if you opt for a shared toilette in the hall) and they accommodated my wishes. The breakfast buffet (cheeses, deli meats, rolls, bread, cereals, yogurts, coffee, tea, juice and more) is set out every morning at 6:30. Everything is fresh and tasty. A two-block walk from the hotel are great Charlottenburg cafes and restaurants. In the other direction is a street-mall area which has excellent shopping only five minutes away including: Karstad, C&A, shoe stores, bakeries and even a terrific Woolworths for toiletries, cosmetics, and so on. I will book this hotel again next year and recommend it to anyone except perhaps for someone who needs an elevator to get up the 20 stairs from the ground floor to the reception area and another 20 stairs if your room is on the next floor.", "Date": "June 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cCity Pension Berlin - A bit of a Surprise!\u201d", "Author": "irslestravels", "ReviewID": "UR7685571", "Content": "Tried to book a few weeks in advance to stay in Berlin and started with those hotels listed in our tour books or recommended on tripadvisor. The more interesting looking and recommended hotels on this site were booked. We came upon some positive reviews on tripadvisor regarding City Pension Berlin so we took our chances with it, thinking the $$$ was reasonable and reviews favorable. However that was prior to the posting by MSKIM enlightenening all to the fact that the shower is located smack dab in the middle of the room, a standalone, not even in a separate room. Since I am one of two women travelling together we would prefer our privacy and were somewhat taken aback by this. The area does seem a bit dodgy area (some of seedy bars etc) but no evidence of weirdos on the street. The hotel itself looks dodgy from the outside, and dated inside, the reception area looks a bit rough. There is a nice market with fresh fruit just a 1 minute walk from the hotel and the Schloss Charlottenburg was a 30 min. walk from the here. Also there was a reasonable internet cafe just a 1 - 2 min. walk from the hotel. Lots of conveniences with quick and easy access. The room was large, with high-ceilings however there was an occasion we did have trouble unlocking the door and had to solicit the assistance of the staff to help get us into the room. And remember the shower is a stall in the middle of the room with absolutely no privacy, while lying in bed you are looking at the shower stall! While the Charlottenburg S-bahn stop (above ground) is just across from the hotel it was noiseless. As a matter of fact the room was very quiet as well as very clean and functional. We did not book an ensuite but the bathroom was right outside our door and although we had to share it, for the most part it felt private and we never heard any noise of others in the bathrrom when we were in our room. Bathroom itself was clean but dated. Again, for a cheap room, you can live with this. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, which was another PLUS for this hotel. Breakfast was OK - pretty standard for a German hotel, we've had better, but it sufficed and we didn't book the hotel for the breakfast. The hotel is situated about a minute away from a U-bahn stop in one direction and a minute away from the S-bahn stop in the other direction. Charlottenburg S-bahn will take you direct into the heart of Berlin in 10-15 minutes e.g. Hauptbahnhof, Hackescher Markt etc. Truly convenient to access the S-bahn & U-bahn, and a big PLUS for this hotel. While the $$$ was certainly reasonable, I would prefer not to stay here again. Nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised and I know it could have been a lot lot worse. Not a bad choice if you're stuck or attempting to hold down the budget.", "Date": "May 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cShower Stall Right in The Room!\u201d", "Author": "MsKim", "ReviewID": "UR7671816", "Content": "If you like privacy taking a shower, think twice about this hotel. We knew the toilet was shared in the hall and the room included a shower and sink in the room. I guess I was expecting a walled off room for the shower, not an actual shower stall right in the room. I traveled with a friend and we were both shocked when we saw this. I'm not really found of having a friend right in the room with me while I am showering. We did make it work, but I probably would not stay here again (unless I was in a room by myself). On a positive note, the room was clean and the location was very convenient with great access to the S-Bahn. Breakfast was nothing extra, but it is nice to eat something and have coffee or tea before venturing out for the day. If you don't mind the shower stall in the same room you sleep in, then stay here. If you like a little privacy, think twice or make sure you are getting an ensuite room that includes the toilet.

First of all, it's literally right across the street from the Charlottonburg S-bahn stop (2 stops from Zoologischer Garten). Second, it was clean, quiet, and private. After staying in a youth hostel in Amsterdam, it was super-nice to get our own room and shower. In a pension, you don't feel like you have to lock all your stuff up in a little locker for it to be safe; you just put it in the closet. And having a shower was nice - you don't have to run down the hall wearing only a towel. (Note about the shower - you have to push the red button at the shower base for the water to drain.) This pension was cheaper per person per night than our hostel cost us. And to top it all off, the people at the desk are ultra nice, and they serve a quaint yet ample breakfast with fresh flowers and good lighting.

The Pension website makes clear that some rooms have a toilet and some don't. This was also made clear in the email that was sent to me by City Pension. We took a room with a toilet, and looking at the toilets along the hall, I'm glad we did.......... The room we had was spacious, with very high ceilings with 19th century ceiling rose and cornices. There was an alcove jutting out into the street which fitted the third bed so that the floor area was not cramped. A small bathroom was built into a box in the inside corner - very small and basic with sliding door that just maintained a deal of privacy. The bathroom was adequate and cleaned OK each day, but cramped and the heat of the hot water went up and down like a yo-yo. City Pension is clearly used by a lot of Germans visiting Berlin for 1-2 nights. Breakfast was nice, continental of course, with fresh rolls. As we were on the next floor up from the reception area/breakfast area, noise was not an issue for us, but we did note that there was a large internal door between the breakfast area (which can be used as a bar at night) and the bedrooms. This would keep any nighttime noise away from the bedrooms - nice. We liked the TV in the room as it was a normal set (not a hotel special), which meant that it had AV inputs and we could connect up our portable DVD player. Berlin itself is not a particularly attractive city, but well worth visiting for things like the bust of Nefetiti, and the Permagon Museum. Also, take enough time to explore KaDeWe - what a Department store should be. We were on a touring holiday and thus needed to park our car. Street parking in the area is available, and the City Pension can provide (at 5 Euro/night) a card to put on the dashboard entitling the car to park in the street outside. The only problem is finding a free spot - we were lucky in that someone pulled out just as we arrived. The location of City Pension is very convenient, being close to both U-Bahn and S-Bahn stations. City Pension is one of those places that could be an absolute horror, but is saved by the care and attention lavished on it by the managers (owners?). If in Berlin again we would certainly consider the City Pension again, but would also look at other places to perhaps get a different aspect to the city.", "Date": "June 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, Scotland", "Title": "\u201csmall, but great hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3473503", "Content": "City Pension Berlin is situated just off Kurfurstendam within one minutes walk of the S-Bahn and U-Bahn.
