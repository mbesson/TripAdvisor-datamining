We had a store owner next door call Mauro, the owner. He sent a lady who didn't speak any English to meet us. We then entered and went up the tiny elevator to see the room, which looked like a Hostel. It smelled, nothing matched it was gross. They wanted 59 euro for this place. We had booked 6 nights but didn't stay 1 night. We went around the corner to a \"Hotel\" instead. Maybe Mauro is a nice guy but the place is a shanty in a horrible area near the Termini train station. You can find something for 10 euro more thats much better. Oh, and by the way, he charged my credit card for 3 nights because we canceled. Don't stay there!!!!!", "Date": "December 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon", "Title": "\u201cA disappointment\u201d", "Author": "guitarsny", "ReviewID": "UR41717822", "Content": "We stayed here the very last night of our trip through Italy and France. There were four of us (2 married couples), and our room was 105 Euros. It consisted of 1 double bed and 2 single beds. We started our journey in Rome and stayed at another hotel, but we just needed to stay here one night before we flew out the next day. When we arrived, it was like we were just showing up at a guy's apartment. The guy, Mauro, was actually really nice and helpful. The room itself was fine, but it was a warm night and we had to pay 5 Euros extra for the AC. We thought our room was already a bit overpriced for what it was, so we were a little annoyed at that. As far as the bathroom, the towels were these weird little sheets, and the shower water was cold in the morning. So if you stay here, take your shower at night. Mauro showed us how to serve ourselves breakfast in the morning (it really was like were were staying at his apartment). He said there would be 10 pastries delivered in the morning, but when we came out to eat breakfast at 8:30 am, the other 2 guests had eaten all ten pastries. I mentioned this to Mauro, but he didn't seem too concerned. The only other breakfast available was stale cereal and sour milk. So, needless to say, we left there hungry. The noise outside was very loud, and the hotel is in a somewhat sketchy area. It is a close walk to the Termini station, so that was a nice feature. I think there are a few simple steps Mauro could take to make the hotel more professional and overall experience here better for his guests. He seems like a really sweet guy, but I think he missed the mark on this one.", "Date": "September 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prostejov, Czech Republic", "Title": "\u201cIt was nice place to stay..\u201d", "Author": "Doudasek", "ReviewID": "UR35860871", "Content": "The staff was really helpful.

I stayed with my mother for 4 nights and he was friendly, easygoing and welcoming. We initially booked Domus Romana but was recommended to this place as there is a lift us so my mother did not have to climb stairs. Mauro gave us good recommendations on where to eat, directions to places and helped us arrange for a taxi to the airport. There is also free wifi. He was also accommodating with our request to leave our luggage in the living room after we checked out and gave us separate keys to get into the apartment since we had returned the room keys. On first impression, the decor of the place is not very attractive but for less than 60 euros a night for a spacious double room, it is definitely a good deal. The location is great since we were just a short walk away from the station. I would recommend this place for people who are looking for a value for money B&B with good vibes (its more bed than breakfast though...) that is safe and convenient.", "Date": "June 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201calmost a shanty.. yuck!\u201d", "Author": "nandyk", "ReviewID": "UR30388349", "Content": "Traveled to Rome and booked this hotel / room for four of us (2 bedroom) for 4 days and was promised as a bread and breakfast.

The bed and breakfast soon turned to an apartment. no breakfast, no amenities (towels, soap etc).. The owner did renegotiate the rate, but thats besides the point.
