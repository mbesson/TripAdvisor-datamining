Santa Monica was the first choice but hotels there are very costly so I decided for Venice beach. The best thing about the hotel is the location. It is right on the beach front and major attractions at Venice. It is also close to Santa Monica. I chose the half seaview studio and it was ok. It had everything and the small kitchenette and utensils provide is a nice touch. The bath room is on the small side and bath amenities are basic, So best bring your own. The room was clean and bright. I had some problems with the TV though. I did not seem to get it to work. There is no car park at the hotel so you will need to park at the open car parks near by. There are a few and the charge around 20 dollars for overnight parking. A good option is you want to experience Venice Beach stay and something different.

My wife and I arrived very late at night and found a letter from the staff with instructions on how to get into the hotel and our room since no one was around. So first lesson here is that the office is open only from 9am till around 8pm so if your going to arrive late make certain that you call before hand and get all the necessary info. This was an error on our part so I thought I should make that clear. If you have a car than take note that there is no hotel parking lot but there is a lot two blocks away that you can park that will charge $15 a night but if your a seasoned traveler you can find a place to park in the area around the hotel for free. The neighborhood is dark and silent at night but I felt safe in it so I'd say check in get the wife and kids situated and go park that car in the neighborhood and just walk back to your room and save yourself some cash.Now on with the review...after we got our instructions and got into the hotel the first thing we notice is the lift. Now my wife and I have stayed in several old buildings in Europe so the lift was not a shocker for us but if your used to modern places you must remember that this is a century old building and the lift was designed for this place. It is a birdcage type of lift that requires that you open the outer door then the cage. After you enter close the outer door and cage and that's it. Make certain that when you get to your floor to close the cage and the lift because if someone else wants to use the lift on another floor it will not work until you close the door so be courteous to others. Now the lift is a little bumpy so don't be alarmed by the ride because its perfectly safe. Up to this point nothing about the hotel had surprised or disappointed me until we got to our room. Now as I said it is an old building so of course the room is old but that wasn't the part I was disappointed about. We had paid a little extra for an ocean view but what we got was a parking lot view of the dingy apartments next door. You can see the ocean to the right when your in this room so I won't say that we didn't have a view of the ocean but in all honesty the only rooms with a true ocean view are the rooms at the front of the hotel and not the sides so I didn't think we should have paid extra for the \"apartment\" view. Ok enough with that and back to the room. The room size is fine for two travelers but I think the hotel could use updated furnishings.The floors were hard wood and the tub was the old porcelain kind with the clawed feet. Overall everything was clean and ready for us and worked as it should. There are lots of places for food and drinks nearby and a small convinence store a few blocks away so anything you need is close by. Being right on the boardwalk was very convenient for beach lovers but remember that it is non stop street noise all day so if your expecting peace and tranquility than the Venice boardwalk is not for you but if your expecting a very lively scene with a big cast of characters than you'll enjoyed it all immensely! All in all I would stay here again.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBest location & best service\u201d", "Author": "Shanearn", "ReviewID": "UR123616381", "Content": "OK, like everyone else has written, you can't beat the location of this hotel - it's right on the boardwalk! This means you can walk out of your hotel and straight into the action that provides Venice Beach its attraction. My wife & I stayed here for 4 nights in January and at times found ourselves just sitting at the front of the building watching all the characters passing by. There are some great characters on the boardwalk. The rooms are quite small by comparison to almost any other hotel but nontheless well appointed with complete kitchen including fridge, coffee maker, cooking facilities and even the kitchen sink. The bed was very comfortable and the room provides quite a lot of storage space for hanging-up your clothes. Be aware that this is a boutique hotel, meaning that daily room cleaning is not provided so you need to ask receiption for new towels each day. The TV was ancient but provided more channels than you will ever need. If you're watching TV you're wasting time and missing out on the real attractions of Venice Beach! Above all else, including the location, is the excellent service provided by all the staff. From the time you arrive Andy (and the rest of the staff) make you feel like you've arrived home. I can honestly state that the genuine hospitality of everyone was the most generous we have received anywhere. The hotels goal is \"to exceed our guests' expectations at every opportunity\", and they certainly do. It's probably the only place we've ever stayed where you feel like giving the staff a hug, not just a handshake, when leaving.

I also seemed to have some wifi hic-cups and rather than blame my computer (which was probably the problem) they simply gave me the password to their office wifi so I could get on to that as it was less busy. I thought they were completely fantastic. The room was comfortable and homey and clean. I had everything I needed. They've made an attempt to funkify the bathroom and the kitchen was well stocked. I booked an Ocean Front room and had a 2nd floor perfect view of the beach. I was brilliant. To top it off they told me next time I come and stay to ensure that I tell them I am coming from Australia as they always try to organise early check in for Aussie's and Kiwi's coming straight from the plane.

The people talking isn't the bad part, it's the stereos and shops with music all mashed together that is a little unnerving. The parking situation is HORRIBLE. There is no parking for the hotel at all. To check in you park in a dark alley behind the hotel to drop off your things and then you have to go on an escapade searching for street parking, which in LA is almost impossible to find. I got 2 parking tickets the last time I stayed here because a parking regulation sign was missing (stolen maybe?) and the other ticket because it was dark and I was tired and I didn't go searching for the parking regulation sign that was probably at the end of the block. Expect to walk at least 6 blocks from where you end up finding parking back to the hotel and possibly getting up at dawn to move your car depending on street sweeping schedules.

It is not for everyone, but it can be a unique experience. The location is great! Right on Boardwalk. Many conveniences - restaurants right next door, shops, performers. Walking around Venice beach you find it is such an active place! basketball courts, skateboard park, outdoor gym, 'tennis looking' paddle sport, sand volleyball nets, bike paths! Beautiful beach right out front, for sunbathing, surfing and swimming. (looks like the hotel have some equipment you can borrow as well.) Staff: We only talked to and dealt with Lewis and he was great and very friendly. In Summary: It is not a fancy place, small (bathroom very small), old, but clean, well equipped (microwave, stove, frig), great location for the beach and many conveniences near by and with a helpful/friendly staff. No A/C but it was comfortable for us in mid July. Parking is difficult during the day, but there are plenty to do within walking distant. You can plan your stay to go to places that you need to drive and coming back around 6-ish when the day tourists are leaving and you should be able to find free street parking for the night.

It was clean and offered everything that we needed. The rooms were spacious and offered \"efficiencies\" (fully equiped kitchen). They were in fact mini suites or \"condos\". The bedroom was spacious with a comfortable bed, good lighting and effective window blinds as well as plenty of closet (wardrobe) storage space and furniture. There was a ceiling fan and tv with dvd player and free local call telephone. Also complimentary (100% free wi-fi Internet access). The kitchen had microwave, fridge, cooker, etc and a dining table. The bathroom was spacious.

Just minutes from LAX airport and easy to find if you are driving. Very close to Santa Monica and handy for Hollywood and downtown. It is safe and relatively inexpensive.

The carpet was stained and a little grungy looking (it's on the beach after all) although everything above that looked newly painted and the furniture was great - I thought the arm chair was amazingly comfortable for a hotel room.

The TV and the refridgerator were working. Our complaints stem from the facts which I will list: 1. I was charged over $700 for the three-night stay. 2. We had no parking at the lot I understood was used by your hotel for sending customers to; we were bluntly told, \"I have no parking for you. Come back in an hour.\" This was after traveling from Sacramento from the airport to check into a hotel. Come back in an hour? That was ridiculous. Needless to say, with the guy's attitude and smug arrogance, I didn't give him a dime, during our stay, for parking when there was room. I parked at the lot adjacent to it. 3. There was not a system for garbage disposal, despite there being a kitchenette. We had to call for our garbage to be taken out. 4. The burners did not work on the stove. 5. The water glasses had a rank odor from being left on a rubber mat for so long, they took on the mat's smell. 6. Our room's floor was covered with sand and being there was no maid service the entire time we were there, stayed there until I used a hand towel to mop with (there was no broom or mop available.) We only strolled briefly on the beach and there wasn't sand on our shoes. 7. We had to call for new towels, washcloths for each day we stayed there. We are clean people and we bathe every day. We expected to have daily bath linens provided without having to call for them. 8. The venetian blind on the ocean-vew window would not close completely to allow sleeping in without bright sunshine.

Just make sure you move the car on a Monday/Tuesday between 10am-12 noon, as we got a ticket..... ($50). It's worth hiring bikes (boardwalk) and cycling to Santa Monica along the bike paths, loads to see.", "Date": "April 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cA Gem!!\u201d", "Author": "2CITALL", "ReviewID": "UR14766206", "Content": "This little hotel tucked into the \"middle\" of the boardwalk of Venice Beach is a hidden gem in a truly amazing area.

We discovered it (actually our friends did) about 2 years ago. If we had the time and money, we would make the 6 hour trek from Phoenix more often! The hotel's location could not be better. It is right on the boardwalk (promenade) -- in fact, right in the heart of the action. The rooms overlooking the boardwalk (and beach/ocean) are more expensive, but worth the splurge in my opinion. (I have to admit there is a selfish side to me that wants to keep this a secret, so the rooms will more likely be available next time I want to book them!) The rooms are sufficiently clean and the kitchens are well-stocked. A couple of years ago, there were some minor repair issues, but the owners seem to be on top of things now. Besides the ideal location, the other wonderful thing about Venice Beach Suites is (are) the proprietors, or office staff or whatever they are. I just know that I have repeatedly interfaced with the same three people in person or on the phone, and all have been great. They go out of their way to accommodate their guests. Plus there are nice little perks, such as a bottle of wine in the room. We even got a follow-up thank you card after our first visit. I notice the vast majority of the reviews of this place have been very positive. There were a couple of negative reviews also, and I cannot help but wonder whether the reviewers knew what they were in for. I should point out that Venice (and the hotel) are probably not for everyone. This will not be your pristine Sheraton-on-a-quiet-family-oriented-beach experience. This is Venice Beach. It is crowded, especially on weekends, and parking spaces are at a premium. (The lot won't accommodate big vehicles, and you may have to drive a while before you find street parking. But once you park your car, you can relax and enjoy the rest of your stay on foot.) There are bums and loonies on the boardwalk and beach. Also entertainers, vendors, and people who dress funny. The stores are quirky, and sometimes risqu\u00e9. Venice Beach is a little less clean than neighboring Santa Monica, and a lot less commercialized. (You'll find very few chain restaurants in Venice.) This is its appeal. I have not known it to be unsafe (I think the police crack down on locals who bother the tourists). But it's also not a sheltered slice of Leave-It-To-Beaver America. To summarize, Venice Beach is a funky, crowded, noisy adventure (at least from late morning to sunset).

Room 108 was large and had a more modern shower, but was inside the back door and had a lot of noise of people coming in and out the door. There was no view from this room. Room 207 was an OK size room with a ball-and-claw bathtub. It also had no view. They could improve this hotel significantly just by replacing the sheets, towels and bedspreads and adding a few coats of paint. Bigger bathroom sinks would also be a plus. The manager, Teri, was so friendly, informative and hospitable, that it was easy for us to ignore some of the hotel's shabbiness.
