We know we were in trouble when we saw this. See some of my misses below to explain: Hits: 1. Great location. You can walk 3 blocks to the \"L\" or 3 blocks to Michigan Avenue shopping. Tons of restaurants in the vicinity and even a whole foods about 5 blocks away. 2. Very nice breakfast included with the room. Served Canadian bacon and eggs one morning and had an oatmeal machine...(didn't like the start of breakfast at 7:30 though, too late for us early risers). 3. Great rate, we paid around $100 a night which is great for the area including the breakfast. 4. Workout room is great. Tons of equipment, modern and very nice room on the 27th floor. 5. Horrible parking fees, but what do you expect in Chicago. 6. Nice to have a mini fridge and microwave, but the fridge never really was cold and did not have temperature control. 7. Thermostat controller was great in the room, we had air condition on since the room was very warm for some reason even though the outside temps were in the 30's. 8. Room was very clean. 9. Great wireless internet connection. No issues and worked great. Misses: 1. Yellow bag of liquid outside the room one morning. Gross and disgusting. Pizza boxes were also scattered outside our room door. 2. Asked the front desk for a quiet room, never received one. 3. Asked the front desk for some extra shampoo, never received it and they just couldn't give it to me when I asked for it in the lobby. 4. 2. Pool is too small to swim, whirlpool was small and old. 3. After an early breakfast, we returned to our room around 8:30 AM and the maid was already in our room? Why they couldn't plan to clean the rooms that checked out first? We had to wait in the hall. Yes, we didn't place the \"Do not Disturb\" on the door, but we returned to the room by 8:30 in the morning. 4. Room was very small. It is called a suite, but very small. 5. Room only had a shower, no bathtub. 6. Water pressure in the sink was horrible. Takes double the time to shave due to low and controlled low water pressure. 7. Too much noise in the halls from the kids and the pool area was always packed. The small pool is shared by the Residence Inn which is attached to the SpringHill. 8. Never received my bill under my door on check-out day. I expect this from Marriott's so I don't have to stand in line in the lobby. I had to stand in line in the lobby. 9. Too few towels. Only two sets of towels were provided. I requested more towels from the hotel, still waiting for the towels. 10. Needed to print out airline boarding passes. Had to go to the lobby which had 1 printer and 3 computers, 1 of which was down. Computers were used by the students most of the time that I observed so I had to return to the lobby numerous times until I could gain access. Once I did, I couldn't print since the printer had a margin issue and never was able to adjust the margins. Had to waste time and print boarding passes at the airport.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "traveljenChicago", "ReviewID": "UR125862879", "Content": "I stayed at the end of February and enjoyed the hotel.

Walking distance to Millenium Park, State Street, Mag Mile, and the great restaurants on Ohio Street which we could see out our window. It truly was a great home base to do so many things in Chicago. On top of that, the value was incredible and the room felt like a mini studio apartment that took advantage of the space so well that I felt like we were in a James Bond lair on a Blimp. The mini living room & desk were separated from the bedroom area by frosted glass panels that could slide open or closed. The TV swiveled so you could watch it from the couch or bed. The shower was the best (but no tub - so ask for that if you want one). There was even a wet bar, fridge, microwave, coffee maker etc. for the price of a value hotel. Not to mention real mugs/glasses in the room instead of plastic cups. Thank you, too, Marriott for limiting the styrofoam at breakfast by having paper plates and paper containers for the awesome oatmeal bar. Please consider paper or other eco-friendly options for the cereal, coffee & tea. (We brought down the mugs from our room.) The lobby and breakfast area were spacious and comfortable.

I pushed for this hotel since I had stayed at (and loved) the adjoining Residence Inn a couple of years ago with friends and loved it...however, our room at Springhill Suites seemed a bit inferior and was cramped for us. The fact that this hotel had a sofa bed as well as the king size bed was a selling point for us, but the sofa bed wound up not being used - we unfolded it and discovered the mattress couldn't be more than 3-4 inches deep, and would definitely not be comfortable to sleep on, so we slept on the couch instead. Another issue we had with the room was that, despite having the air conditioning on and set at 68 in December, the room was still quite warm, mostly due to the fact that there was only one vent that we could find, and it was way over by the window, not allowing for adequate air flow. Breakfast was delicious, convenient and filling - if you got down there early enough to not have to spend a lot of time in line or trying to find a place to sit. The fact that there was an indoor swimming pool at this hotel was also a selling point, as it is hard to find downtown Chicago hotels with one, but when my family went to the pool to swim, they couldn't stay in the water longer than 10-20 minutes because it was so cold. The location of the hotel was excellent; there are 2 Starbucks within a block and a half radius of the hotel, several sit-down restaurants (including Harry Caray's and Rosebud Trattoria on the same street) and a few casual dining places nearby as well. The red line is a few blocks northeast and you can get on the purple and brown lines a couple of blocks west. The Magnificent Mile is not a far walk to the east, either.

I was in town on business, with a full day of behavioral field research ahead of me on a Sunday. I needed a quiet place to keep well on Saturday night. Instead, after dodging loud kids in the elevators and passing many loud rooms, I thought my room was safe and quiet. Nope, I had to call security Saturday night at 1 a.m. when the college-age girls in the room next door to me returned drunk and decided to have a shrieking, crying, \"You slept with my boyfriend, you [insert explicative of choice]!!!\" knock-down, drag-out fight complete with the sounds of furniture banging. To the hotel's credit they sent security up immediately and I didn't hear anything afterwards. On Sunday morning, the hotel was teeming with families trying to check and the elevator literally stopped on 19 of the 22 floors on the way down, with no one able to fit after 3 stops. After 10 minutes of riding the elevator, the breakfast room was so crowded with what appeared to be nothing but kids in the 10-22 year old age range and a few parents, I gave up and went to Einstein Bagels next door. What knocked this down from average to poor for me is the odd shaped room and terrible lighting, especially the glaring fluorescent light over the bed. I ended up awkwardly moving the desk lamp over to the bedside table so I could enjoy bedside lighting more appropriate for reading and unwinding. Things were better after the weekend when all the kids checked out, but pay heed to all the terrible/ poor/ average reviews by folks who weren't in town for a special shopping and theatre (or bar hopping) weekend in Chicago. I'm sure if you're looking for a good value for a family-friendly place, where you plan to stay out late, be noisy, order pizza and watch TV this is a good value for the price, but I won't be letting my company book me here again - I will try a different Marriott brand if I end up in Chicago again.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cChicago Family Vacation\u201d", "Author": "IndyAdam", "ReviewID": "UR121919329", "Content": "I traveled in Dec 2011, with wife and 4 kids, 10 and under.

I booked Springhill suites a week before and after reading all the reviews, i was so excited to get there! I requested an early check in time(which we got A+ there) and also a high floor room. Upon check in, we were told that the highest floor they had was the 5th floor. Keep in mind that i upgraded to the Corner Suite. I figured being in the fall, they tried filling up the first floors first. after we got settled in, we found new friends in the elevator and said that they also booked a week before and got a corner suite on the 18TH FLOOR! I don't know if it was because me and my girlfriend were only 21 and the hotel thought they could put us anywhere just because we were young or what. Also keep in mind that i am a full time college student working 30-35 hours a week just to support my girlfriend and i. Later that night i checked my bank account and THEY CHARGED ME $120 MORE THAN WHAT THEY SAID THERE WERE GOING TO WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING IT! i complained at the front desk and they said they took extra out because that if i charged anything to the room, then it would taken out of the extra charge amount and that they would credit my card a couple days after i checked out. I have never heard of this from others hotels. This is where i really lost respect for this hotel. I have a student loan i pay monthly and being that they took the extra $120 out, i spent the weekend calling friends and family seeing if they could loan me the money until Marriot credits my account back. I will never again stay at this hotel or any other hotel owned by marriot because of what they have done to me.

First, let me say the location of this hotel is great. It's right on Hubbard where you will find numerous bars, nightclubs and high-end restaurants all within a short walk. Michigan Ave is a medium walk or short cab ride away. The hotel itself is clean, and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. The rooms are nice. For a 3.5 star hotel the rooms, in my opinion, are just as good if not better than some of the 4-star hotels I've stayed at in the area. They call it a suite, but it's really a queen bed on one side, and couches on another that are separated by a work desk with sliding glass (see pics), but the nice added feature is the 'wet bar' or kitchenette. It includes a microwave, sink and small fridge which you don't usually get in a 4-star. Public transportation is also a short trip in any direction. CTA bus stop is a block away and will take you way North, and Red Line stops are a short walk if you're going to the Cubs or Sox game. You can't beat the nightlife this is near. It's located in the heart of River North. If you are looking stuff to do, you can't go wrong here. If you're going to hang out north of here, say Gold Coast area, I'd recommend getting a hotel further north, but for Loop/River North access, stay here. Overall, this is my new favorite River North place to stay. Oh, and by the way, this hotel works in conjunction with AAA. The money I saved booking a two-night stay at the AAA rate was enough to pay for a one-year single AAA membership. So I've already broke even and I still get to use the AAA rates throughout the year.

While the city's Cub's have not hoisted a trophy in more than 100 years, others teams have been champions and anyone staying at the Springhill Suites has picked a winner. First, the location is great. Going by subway or train was an inexpensive $2.50 each way as opposed to $40+ by taxi. Although a couple of blocks away from the station, with roller bags as common as Michael Jordan t-shirts, the few blocks are not a hassle. Besides, a taxi is just a few bucks from the subway. But once inside the hotel, the place delivers. Arriving early at Marriott properties usually is not a bad idea, but coming in on the Sunday of the Chicago Marathon, meant that many people elected for late departure. In fact, the hotel accommodated those who ran the race with even later than usual check-out. That's a great service and the hotel is commended for it. As a guy who has run a couple of marathons, but finished hours after the winner, the chance to grab a hot shower is welcome. The main level has a series of large windows facing south that let in a plenty of natural light and comfortable chairs if you're just hanging out or waiting for someone. For families with kids who like the Wii, there is a game in the lobby. When I walked through Super Mario was being played. I had a King Suite room. The bed was good -- not great, but more than adequate. The lighting in the room was solid, but could have been better placed. A plus was a clock radio that let me plug in my iPod and use my own play-list to wake up. Nice touch. The TV swiveled great for bed-time watching, but it was a bit off-kilter for watching from the room's couch. Overall, the King Suite was a winner and would have been four stars if not for the TV angle. As with most SpringHill properties, there is free breakfast in the morning. Canadian bacon, or sausage, scrambled eggs and the ever-present waffle maker were the hot choices along with cold cereal, english muffins, mini-pastries and a pretty decent hot oatmeal. I had dinner at Hub51, the restaurant right next door. A meal outside with a mild breeze blowing and air temps around 70 degress was slightly chilly, but the turkey meatloaf was seasoned well, and the fries reminded me of Arby's curly fries. Get the green tea to stay warm. As a runner (although not in the marathon during this visit) a joy of this hotel is that it's less than two miles from Lake Michigan. A dawn run to the lake was great. The sun peaked over the horizon a few minutes after I got there, an early sweat on my brow. The hotel is two blocks from the Chicago River if interested in one of the many floating tours. I hear that they're enjoyable, but I didn't have the time. I heard that the in-house gym at Springhill was pretty good from a guy on the elevator, but I can't be sure.

Just before I arrived in Chicago, in fact, I was in Toronto's Eaton Centre hotel, where I had a fantastic 3-day stay. Everything about the Springfield Suites was stellar: the location could not be beat --it's not just close to the classic Lou Malnati's pizza but my favorite Mexican restaurant in the country, Frontera Grill, is a block or so away. While the weather was pretty hot outside, I could always count on a clean, fresh, made-up and comfortable room. The breakfasts were awesome and you guys should hire me as a line waffle cook, since I was so adept at making them. The hot foods were good and everything was refilled and kept delicious. Yes, there were many guests and it was hard sometimes to attend to everyone, but your staff was simply first class. They would come up and ask us how everything was. I liked that there was free and problem-free wireless Internet access in the rooms. Excellent. The coffee was plentiful and nice and bold. Oh and I must mention a staff member named Veronica who went far and beyond the level of service. Veronica normally keeps up the breakfast room, along with the other staffers. I came downstairs around 11 am on Thursday morning (July 21), just as the staff was cleaning up the breakfast room. I asked her if they had taken down the big ice water dispenser that is normally put out for breakfast. Apparently they had. I had my empty water bottle with me and I had planned to simply fill it up as I prepared to tackle the hot downtown streets. Veronica insisted on helping me. She took my bottle and disappeared into the back. It took her a little bit of time and honestly I didn't know where she had gone. In about 5 minutes she appeared with my bottle full of ice water. I'll repeat that again: ICE water. I have no idea she was able to get ice cubes INTO my bottle. It was just the thing I needed because that water was kept colder longer. She went out of her way with effervescence and enthusiasm ---she really wanted to exceed my expectations. As an ebullient representative of the Springfield Suites, I felt she made your hotel shine that day. I know it doesn't sound like much but she really deserved some mention.

I basically ended up here based on a combination of availability, price, and location. Regarding location, visitors to Chicago should seriously consider River North as a good base to center themselves. Close to everything. The River North area also has a great variety of restaurants and pubs. Look at a good map and do the research. The Springhill Suites shares the building with its sister brand, Residence Inn. Lobby registration is on the second floor (enter on Dearborn); walk left off the elevator to the Springhill registration desk; walk right to the Residence Inn registration. The north side of the building is the Springhill Suites. From the outside, the building isn't architecturally pleasing; but the interior is very pleasant and exceeds expectations. The lobby is complete with fireplace and comfortable chairs and sofas. There is a Wii set up for those into gaming. The free breakfast area is in a large area off the lobby. While we're talking about breakfast, no complaints here. Slightly better than average eggs, sausage, oatmeal, waffles, fruit, baked goods, etc. that you usually see at these types of hotels. Check-in was efficient and friendly. Also, the front desk person was very helpful to me by printing out public transportation schedules. I should mention that the Lake/Clark subway (L) station is a short 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. For those who don't mind walking and public transportation, this hotel is served well by public transportaton. I stayed two nights in a room on the 8th floor. Top floor is the 27th, the location of the pool and workout center. Even at the 8th floor level, the view is decent of the John Hancock building, Wrigley Buildin, and other views east. My floor only had a few rooms; perhaps 10 or 12. Not sure if all the floors are like this. It's nice that you don't need to walk far to your room from the elevator. I believe all rooms were occupied and it was very quiet. Either solid walls or quiet people! My room had a King bed so it was more spacious than the rooms with two double beds. The Springhill Suites have a semi-partioned area that serves as a sitting/work area with a desk and sofa (with attached chaise). There is also a sink, mini-fridge, and microwave. Free wired Internet connection (not sure if they had wireless). The bottom portion of the window had two smaller windows that can be \"popped\" open slightly to get \"fresh air.\" Nice idea, but it was too nosiy to keep them open (despite good weather). When the windows were closed tight, outside city noises were held to a muffled din. City noise was really not an issue for me. The bed was extremely comfortable. Shower water temperature and pressure were very good. Maintenance and cleanliness of the bathroom and room in general were first class. As long as the cost remains competitive, I would definitey consider staying here again during future trips to Chicago.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cTerrible service and auto break-in spoils stay\u201d", "Author": "sjukone", "ReviewID": "UR110628511", "Content": "I recently stayed at this downtown hotel, over the labor day weekend. Upon arrival, we were quickly greeted and assigned a room, despite being early. This was great and we were thankful.

Unfortunately, we did not find out about the break-in until Sunday afternoon. After speaking with someone from the garage, a police report was filled out. Nothing further could be done, due to the garage manager being off for the long weekend. I proceeded to speak to the hotel manager, Sean. He refused to do anything to help me or compensate me for my situation. Upon insistance, he did refund the price of the parking, but would do nothing else other than offer a beer. I assume the alcohol was to make me forget what had happened. I live 6 hours away from the hotel and know nothing about the area or possible places to have the window replaced. He would do nothing to help, but argue it was not the hotels responsibility and I parked there at my own risk. I later found out 3 other cars had been broken into that day. He knew nothing of this and insisted it was my problem to work out with the garage...that he says they dont own, but their name is all over and they charge guests to use. The following morning, I spoke to another staff, who did find an extremely kind custodian to clean out the broken glass from my car, but I drove home without a window. Luckily, it didnt rain. I would never stay at this hotel again, due to the poor service I received and lack of compassion by the management staff. Further, if crime is such an issue at that garage, they should warn guests prior to them checking in.

Keep in mind that if you're driving, you're paying at least $38/day to park your car (self park, $48 for valet), but that's typical of any hotel in downtown Chicago. This does give you unlimited in and out service during your stay.) I'll get the only real \"knocks\" we have against it out there first. And both are admittedly very neglible. First off, if you're on the lower floors, especially weekends, you will likely hear sirens, horns and such from time to time. We were on the fourth floor. But it never bugged us. But, if you're a light sleeper, it's something to consider. Never heard regular traffic noise though so that's a big plus. The other is only a personal perspective. Due to the easy access and relatively low cost, there were a lot of FAMILIES over the weekend with kids. And not all people control their kids the best. But during weekdays, it's almost exclusively business travelers. Lastly, room storage was pretty minimal for clothing and the likes. One small \"closet\" and two small drawers that aren't very deep front to back. We had booked a room with two double beds since we were travelling with friends for a concert so the point was literally just somewhere to sleep for two nights. When we arrived, they had overbooked but very quickly fixed it by giving us two separate King rooms which was a nice added bonus. The staff was helpfull and polite. The rooms were very simple but clean and functional. The bed isn't the most comfortable you'll find out there, but they are still very good beds (we just have a very nice one at home). If you're coming in from 90/94, it couldn't be easier to get there and out. It's pretty much a straight shot! If you want something a little bit nicer overall, it's attached to the Residence Inn for Marriot and that's about $20 more a night. In our opinion, the location of the hotel was incredible! For starters, you're in River North. Business is right across the river for that. But if you're going to see/do Chicago, you can't beat it. So many restaurants, parks, museums, etc all within excellent walking distance (we consider that to be up to two miles).

They are widely published elsewhere, even by the property itself. Let me isolate some concerns i have about this hotel that the hotel itself might consider rectifying to enhance its hospitality: 1. I realize that hotels thrive on groups, but during my recent visit my colleagues and I had to navigate the lobby and breakfast areas that were filled with sports teams and bridal parties. It might be helpful to encourage these groups not to congregate around the elevator or other passable areas. Too, guests should not be permitted to be playing the Wii or even in public areas drinking beer, no less in bottles! Another way that crowds might be ushered along is to have employees clear tables in the breakfast area. The staff seems to be hidden and could be better utillized. 2. While I appreciate the security the hotel has to access higher floors, I have two concerns. First, what made the hotel designers think it was a good idea to have the security card insert so close to the floor. When you have things in your hand and have to do so much negotiation, it becomes quite an adventure. Secondly, unfortunately, security measures are in place on the \"lobby\" and \"ground\" floors, but there needs to be more monitoring of the noise and rowdiness on the upper floors. 3. My colleague and I are Platinum members of the Marriott rewards program. Both of us, to the shagrin of our families, spend over one hundred nights at Marriott properties. Many properties acknowledge our loyalty by a welcome word of gratitude and offer us an upgrade. The front desk staff at this property was interested in finding out what brought us to town rather than acknowledging our loyalty.

On our first attempt at opening the sofabed, there wasn't enough room to open it all the way, since it bumped into the desk and the desk was attached to the wall and couldn't be moved. We eventually had to rearrange the furniture to reposition the sofabed so that it could be used. Long story short, it made for cramped quarters.

Everyone in the hotel seems happy to be working there, I've been to lots of hotels where that isn't the case and the service suffers. At Marriott you never feel like you're wasting their time. The hotel itself. Residence Inn and Springhill share the same building. Normally I stay at Residence but it wasn't available. The SH rooms are quite a bit smaller, and they face away from the lake, so even on a high floor the views aren't spectacular. But they were more than adequate. The pullout was comfortable. Lots of storage. Somebody had mentioned the firehall. It is quite close, and you do hear a lot of sirens, but noise pollution in Chicago is extreme anyway. We laughed and noticed it quite a bit at first, but quickly got used to it. Breakfast was good we did the Residence breakfast and the Springhill, and they were the same, the one on the Residence side was a little more spacious, they served the same food. No bacon, and very little fruit on either side, which was disappointing. Wifi was easy to use and the lobby even has a wii, so, no kids running around underfoot! The 27th floor pool was tiny, but with gorgeous views. Gym was quite large, as was the laundry room. There was a patio, but it was always locked. Elevators were confusing, as they weren't labeled for which hotel you were going to. Make sure you get back on the one you got off! All in all, a fantastic trip.

If you are using public transportation to get into Chicago its 6 blocks from Millineium Station and 2 blocks from the \"L\" Blue Line. The room's are excellent. We had a 2 double suite with a fold out sectional couch. The rooms could be a little bigger, but we had 6 guys staying in the same room. On a side note, there are 2 hotels in this building and they share a common lobby; Spring Hill Suites on the left and Residence Inn on the right. This can become confusing if you have a had a little too much to drink and end up at the same room number but in the wrong hotel. The staff was excellent and will help you in anyway possible. The breakfast was fantasic and had just about everything you can think of. I will definately stay at this hotel again when I return to Chicago.", "Date": "May 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bahamas", "Title": "\u201cI am ready to go back!!!\u201d", "Author": "Compleks", "ReviewID": "UR28018817", "Content": "I highly recommend this hotel and Chicago in general to everyone.

Red line tube stop is also a couple of blocks away. Staff are welcoming and friendly, and the room was ideal for us - a good size, with modern fittings and free wi-fi. The king size bed was comfortable, and it was nice to have that little more space than you normally get, as all the rooms are actually suites with a sofa area and sink/fridge/microwave. Good shower too. Breakfast was fine, although we did get a little bored of the same selection - not a problem if you are staying for a long weekend. At the price we paid, the fact that we had one at all was a bonus. Waffles were good, but they did seem to run low on fresh fruit during the mid week. We used the pool and hot tub and found both to be clean and very quiet during our time there. The pool isn't great if you are planning on swimming lengths (it's very small), but the gym is there too, so fitness fanatics should be fine. Our one small issue would be with the lifts, which use a really annoying access card system to prevent non-residents from getting onto floors.

You can pretty much walk down that street and find a good variety of pub-type places as well as Brasserie Jo (very good French food). Ruth's Chris and Harry Caray's, both higher-end, also nearby. Plenty of retail in walking distance as well in case you forgot anything. One minor complaint was the elevators, which required the use of your room key before they worked.

I found it through Expedia and it seemed to have glowing reviews, but I was suspect what the downside might be as I had never been to the area or Chicago before. Getting to the hotel was reasonable from Grand station on the red line subway and was probably a 5-6 minute walk. The area itself is filled with late night hot spots and restaurants, though I feel the younger set (under 35) will be most pleased. The hotel entrance is unusual in that you walk into a lobby with elevators which you must take to a second lobby with the actual front desk. Odd, but possibly an advantage in some ways and keeps the check-in area free of chaos. The hotel service/staff is excellent. very friendly and helpful-although very young for the most part. They seem to try hard and smile whenever you cross their path. The rooms blew me away for value: very nicely appointed with a flat screen TV, king bed with different types of pillows, excellent shower with good hot water and pressure, and very clean. This site lists this as a 2 star hotel, but that's not possible, I'd say 3 at least given the room and decor. My favorite part of the room was that it was quiet-no street noise, no neighbor noise, no noise period (I was on the 19th floor I should point out). The breakfast buffet in the morning was nice as far as hotel buffets go. Some of the options included eggs, sausage, piping hot oatmeal, cereals, English muffins, white and wheat bread, juices, waffles, etc. It would be great if they added hash browns or potatoes-it would have felt complete. In summary: an excellent experience in a hotel that felt very new. I didn't have time to visit the pool or exercise room so I can't comment on it however.

It's a very cute concept, with rooms similar to a Hyatt Place in design. We had a big king bed and really comfy seating area separated by a desk and frosted glass slidable window-like partition. Loved the wireless internet (also wired, both free); as well as the beverage chiller (like a mini fridge but not quite as cold) and the microwave. But the room lacked storage despite lots and lots of empty floor space in the sleeping area. Oddly our bedroom area was huge, while the sitting area was partitioned off in a small and cramped area next to the door. The hotel size swells 4x on weekends according to the desk clerk, and it shows. Weekend breakfast is mobbed and there aren't enough seats, although the attendants do a terrific job keeping the food stocked. And with groups of 4 and 5 crammed into rooms meant for just one or two, the hotel is showing a surprising amount of wear and tear for being so new. These rooms just weren't designed for heavy traffic, which is a shame because it's otherwise a nice place to stay. Our room had a nasty stain on the floor near the door, a lighter stain on the sectional couch, some peeling laminate on the microwave counter, and a hole in the desk chair's woven back from it hitting the edge of the desk. Weirdly, the hotel doesn't iron its linens (the front desk clerk said they \"don't have a presser\"), so the sheets, comforter and the decorative thingie on the foot of the bed were a wrinkled mess (not very reassuring to crawl into wrinkled sheets; we just crossed our fingers the linens had been changed since the last guest). The shower (no tub in our room) also didn't look super clean, but front desk assured us this is just a cosmetic problem from the laminating and that it's a problem in all the rooms. The upside: great location, super nice desk staff, free Wi-Fi, and it's sort of sweet to see kids in pajamas at the weekend breakfast, which lent a friendly family feel. But it would be nice to see the rooms better maintained -- and maybe some limits on the number of people the hotel allows in one room, especially since it shares space with the Residence Inn, which is really better suited for quad and quint parties sharing one room.

While some have posted criticisms about the room sizes, we felt the design of the rooms was so smart that you didn't need the extra room (drawers inside a closet actually works very well). There were 4 of us in a room with 2 double beds and sofa sleeper, and we were fine. In fact, we ordered take-out dinner and sat very comfortably in the sitting end of the room. The rooms were exceptionally clean, bright, and we appreciated the modern style. One of the most important things about a hotel stay is your ability to actually sleep. Our beds were extremely comfortable, and even though the hotel was full during our stay, we didn't hear any noise when we were in our room. As others have stated, the staff is very friendly and helpful. We had not been in our room long when someone from the hotel knocked on our door to make sure we had everything we wanted. Finally, I just want to add that the hotel does not scrimp where many in its price range do. The towels are very good quality, and the shower is great, and as I've already stated so are the beds, and wall thickness.

They have a very good free continental breakfast with hot eggs, waffles, and the usual cold foods. There is free internet in the rooms.

Our room had two double beds (no queens ever available--every room same, single king or two doubles plus pullout sofa) and a pull out sofa. It has a small fridge, a microwave, a desk and chair, and is very neuveaux in design\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsee many tripadvisor photos of the rooms. The rooms are very long and narrow, and although there is a nice floor-to-ceiling window view of the city (higher floors better\u00e2\u20ac\u201d26 floors plus 27th fl pool), the rooms feel startlingly tight. If one is looking for spaciousness, then these rooms are not it. The dresser is inside the closet, you will stumble across the pull-out bed in open position, and the bathroom with sink outside it is tight and has a walk-in closet feel. These rooms are great for two people; four is tight. The fridge, microwave, in-room free wifi and free local calls are welcome touches. The staff is extremely courteous and helpful, right from check-in. The mornings have a free breakfast of simple eggs, sausage, oatmeal and the like. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at any Marriott Residence Inn or Fairfield Inn, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s similar, Make your own waffles, that sort of thing. But nice, and free. I did not use hotel parking to comment on it, but driving in Chicago is horrendous in general, and I lived here for five years. Merchandise sales tax is\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhold your breath\u00e2\u20ac\u201d10.25% as of this writing. So, buy your camera, batteries, film, underwear and other non-grocery items at home before you get here. Wondering if the Mob still runs Chicago, because I need to find a loan shark just to afford the sales tax. Hotel tax similarly criminal. Chicago Restaurant tax nearly 11%! Includes Mickey Ds and any eatery. The Springhill lobby is decorated with funky, modern minimalism and is pleasing\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthis hotel is in the same building and shares the same entrance as the Marriott Residence Inn Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsee reviews of that hotel and pick the one with the best deals/rates when you stay here. Same building. I would do plenty of rate shopping as, in this area, this hotel is not as nice (although newer) than the Marriott Renaissance on One Wacker Drive up the street\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut in general that hotel is pricier. So, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting this one at full price and that one at a discount, that one is better. The swimming pool at this Springhill Suites is, in a word, abysmal. A backyard pool is larger, and it plus the hot tub had more people than I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen in a pool in my life. For the number of rooms in this building, the pool was a complete disaster, loaded with peeing children, stressed parents, and littered with towels and trash. Some people would go to a city hotel for an indoor oasis in the wintertime\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthis is not the place for that. Every night, same scene. I honestly wonder if the building fire code is broken with that many screaming people in a pool the size of two king sized beds. There is a workout area adjacent to the swimming pool with LifeFitness brand elliptical trainers and treadmills, TVs and weights which is serviceable. Better choice, run along the Chicago lakefront. There are 9 coin-op laundry machines ($1 wash, $1 dry) right next to the gym area. The key feature of this hotel is its location: 2 blocks from Harry Carey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Restaurant and House of Blues, within 4 blocks of Hard Rock, Rock N Roll McD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Sportsmart, Chop House, and Michigan Av. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a CVS two blocks away and Walgreens four blocks away and Navy Pier is about 8 blocks away. It is, in a word, the quintessential location for all of your Chicago activities if you plan to walk. Eateries are all around this place within a couple blocks\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddozens and dozens\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand the area is safe. Blues on Clark, other clubs and bars are two blocks away. Watertower Place 6 blocks away. The only area slightly further\u00e2\u20ac\u201dabout ten blocks-- is Millennium Park and Grant Park, so if your whole vacation is being there and seeing the museums and Soldier Field and theater district around those parks, then you should stay on the south side of the river (e.g. One Wacker Drive Marriott Renaissance is closer). Or take the bus or shed some shoe leather (go on, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for you) from Springhill Suites. Frankly, as any Chicagoan knows, staying in the area right around Grant Park on lower Michigan Avenue is not desirable, particularly at night: desolate, more vagrants selling Streetwise, that sort of deal. But Marriott Renaissance is fine as it is on the river. So, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be better staying here on North Dearborn at Springhill for most of the tourist attractions in Chicago. For singles or those \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on the prowl\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the Dearborn area is superb as you can walk to the best clubs in all of Chicago (e.g. Excalibur, The Redhead Piano Bar) and there are three adult bookstores within eyeshot of the Springhill Suites. There is a Starbucks and an Einstein Bagel one block away. Suggest www.maps.live.net and placing address 410 North Dearborn in and checking a birds eye view and you will learn plenty about where this hotel is located. Very sweet. So, all in all, I like the newness, but can see that this hotel will someday become dated and worn by travelers who tend to slam bang around in the tiny rooms.. The rooms are claustrophobic, and I know, we all say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153well, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just going to be sleeping there, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but in the end, size does matter. I urge you to grab the book or the laptop and simply, as I am doing while I write this review, sit in the lobby and enjoy some light and space. All that said, the rates are good, the location is premiere, and the staff is very friendly. With the room amenities such as microwave, plus the wifi and continental (mostly) breakfast, the place is strong. It is the future for hotels, in small ways, such as no ice vending machines on the floors to save space and noise, to large ways such as middle priced rooms, with amenities (fridge, et cetera) but very tight rooms to fit as many lodgers as possible in the hotel. A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153city\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel by any standard, not a resort, not overly posh, but for now, hip and trendy (cues from The Standard in California). Just leave your swim trunks at home. Plenty of others have added photos of the rooms, so I added some of the exterior and the lobby.
