As soon as I checked in I was presented with the bill and asked to pay. No problem, I'm happy to conform with their policy. I was given the key to my room (N\u00b027) and went to find the elevator. Couldn't find it so asked the man at reception who informed me that they didn't have an elevator. I suggested that as it was room N\u00b027 that it would be on the second floor. No, he said, it's the 6th floor. OH! Soon I'm going to be 70 years old but off I went with my luggage to get up to the 6th floor. Luckly I'm fit for my age. It took awhile to make it but I got there. I passed, on the stairway near the 4th floor, a youngish woman who had checked in before me who was trying to make it with her luggage to the 5th floor. I offered to help her but she thought she'd eventually be able to make it alone. I gave her the number of the emergency ambulance service in Paris in case she needed it. I have noted that another reviewer medtioned that this is an overpriced hostel. Now I know what they mean. I realised when coming back down the staircase that it is steep, dangerous staircase. You need to keep one hand on the handrail as if you trip, you'd have a long, nasty fall. And you need to bring your suitcases down one at a time, with one hand on the handrail and the other with your suitcase (of course you have to walk back up 6 floors to get the other/s). The room; an attic room, small and not well sound proofed. Cheap hostel type furniture. Water had come in through the roof and the ceiling in the bathroom had bad paint damage. Worst of all was the toilet. If the management of this hotel would like to walk up the 6 flights of stairs and take a look at the toilet seat in room N\u00b027, thay will find it is chipped, cracked in two and unsuitable for use from a hygiene point of view. In future, when I'm asked to pay up front on arrival for a room I'm going to insist that I see the room first. BUT, if you say no, they'd probably debit your credit card as a 'no show' as they have all your details. You have very little room to negociate once they have your credit card details and I now understand why this hotel wants you to pay up front. Nowhere in any publicity have I found any mention that there is no elevator in this hotel.

When we asked to be put in a different room the front desk worker said he had other rooms available but he would not change our room for us.

We booked directly through their website and had a last minute rate of 59 Euro which was fantastic. The young man was welcoming when we arrived, readily attempting to speak English to us in spite of our efforts to speak French. Our room was unique, in our experience: two narrow rectangles, the first being the room's entry corridor, that was flanked on one side by a small bathroom, and a separate shower stall. Both were very modern, had sliding glass doors, and were newly tiled and outfitted. The chandelier that divided the first rectangle from the second rested partly on the shower and was unavoidably knocked when I opened the tiny armoir unit. But is was fun and delightfully odd to even think of keeping the chandelier in there! The second rectangle accommodated the double bed and that's about it. The TV, which we did not use, was suspended from a ceiling bracket. The ceilings were high so we didn't feel closed in. We had one window into the centre courtyard/ shaft. No view. The room was very clean. The sheets were immaculate. The bed was comfortable. The whole place was loaded with character and quirks. The staff was very helpful the following day, keeping our luggage until late afternoon. I would stay here again, for a short stay, but I would not centre my Paris holiday around it, because the room was too small - no where to unpack, really. But that's just me, being used to more space. The area is fantastic, safe, and vibrant. No noise at night. I recommend this as an affordable, clean and friendly hotel where guests should not expect 5 star comforts - stairs and tiny spaces abound - but good conscientious inn-keeping is evident.
