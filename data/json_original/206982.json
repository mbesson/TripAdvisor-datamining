The staff are helpful but the thing that really lets the hotel down is its lack of facilities. There is no bar or restaurant, although there are some good tapas bars nearby so this is not a major issue. 'Room Service' is essentially a pizza delivery menu so you cannot bill to your room. Essential items to the business traveller such as an iron to iron your shirts are not available, not even from reception. The beds are hard and uncomfortable and the pillows are hopeless. On the plus side (yes there are some), the hotel is cheap and clean.

It's about 25 walk from Puerta de Alcala and we found it practical to get to various sites around Madrid where we were meeting friends. The room was quite large, and the fact that it was an interior room meant there wasn't much natural light, but was wonderfully quiet. If you're visiting Madrid you're not in the room much during the day so light wasn't a big issue, but quiet always is. No noise from neighbouring rooms or cleaning ladies in the morning which is always a good thing. We got a great rate which included 2 nights breakfast, free mini-bar and 5pm check-out on Sunday for 190 Euros. Breakfast is always wonderful at NH hotels, variety of freshly cut and beautifully presented fruit, various fresh fruit juices, variety of breads, cakes and pastries, Spanish tortilla, cheese etc. etc. For someone very picky about hotel breakfasts, NH always get top marks. Like most NH hotels they have an agreement with the local Telepizza for room service, which is fine (and fun) if you just order it once or twice during your stay. All in all, just what you expect from an NH hotel, and comparing with other hotels I've been I think this one deserves 4 stars.", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and wonderful receptionist called Evie\u201d", "Author": "Kim-Boz13", "ReviewID": "UR132887897", "Content": "Well located hotel, very close to the Metro- Nunez Balboa, and easy access to and from the airport.

Great Rooms - clean comfortable and tidy - nice bathrooms - overall good service Breakfast - really great - lots of choice and good value for money - fruits / cheese / meats / drinks and lots of food - replenished every time by the chef. Location - Salamanca area - really smart area - many restuarants and shops nearby - easy walking distance to the main centre - or you cna take the Metro form Nunez Balbao - very close indeed. We arrived at the airport - had two choice - either take a Metro - line 8 to Nunez Balbao - cost \u20ac2.50 - ( changing in May 2012 ) or a bus No 200 to Av De America - \u20ac2.00 - and last stop and then 10minutes walk. For a good value - get a 3 day pass which works out cheaper currently \u20ac13.00 - individual day pass is \u20ac6.00 - the pass finishes at 1.30pm at night - so the 3 day pass would be good option. If you get a good price for this Hotel - take it - its not in the heartland of the \"tourist spot\" - which is nice - as the area is really smart. The only point which was annoying is that they have a WIFI in the lobby - Free but did not work and the reception was not very helpful in sorting this out.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood Spanish Suprise\u201d", "Author": "RicardoAssef", "ReviewID": "UR120633781", "Content": "The hotel rate is affordable for similar hotels in the same area.

They are always nice and you can rest assured you will get a nice room and a good meal. The problem is that NH has expanded so much in Madrid that they will turn anything into one of their properties. This is the case here. The building is not new and that you can tell as soon as you go past the Lobby (which is fairly nice, as is the bar/restaurant area). Facilities are old (we got stuck in the elevator in between floors however we got moving again soon!), rooms are darkish and they need refurbishment. Location is OK. Maybe a bit too quiet meaning that there are not that many nice places to go for a bite or a drink. Breakfast is very good though. That remains within the NH philosophy!

We experienced something which was rather disturbing during breakfast: We entered the restaurant and there wasn't anyone who would tell us where to sit/took our name/room no. We sat down to a table which was for three people. We where asked to move to a table for two in the corner as the waiter said this is table for 4 (it was clearly laid for three) and 2 minutes another straight couple sat there and they were not asked by the waiter to move even though there were tables for 2 available.
