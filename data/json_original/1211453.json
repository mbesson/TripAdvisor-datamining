The apartment had everything I needed including washing machine, dishwasher, full kitchen (except stove) and microwave, etc. Daily cleaning was nice, as was free coffee and bottled water. The apartment was quite large. The location is not perfect, though it is fairly practical. It is 7-8 minutes from Termini on the back street, and right beside Castro Pretorio (two subway stops from the Coliseum). The apartment are a good five minutes walk from the main hotel. If you have free breakfast included in the morning, you do need to get to the main building. The location is safe and the steet well-lit at night, and the apartment was very quiet. I was always well-served by the front desk in the main building; they, for instance, printed tickets for visits. In fact, they seemed genuinely willing to help and wanted to please. To be picky, the television had satellite with almost all stations in Italian, but it did not have CNN International or BBC World News. Next time in Rome, I will go back in an instant.

Another lil gem is the addition of a Nespresso Coffee machine. All kitchen cookware are there along with a washing machine. Overall, we had a very pleasent stay with friendly staff who helped us alone the way during our first visit to Rome. Pros: - Very friendly and helpful staff - Nice buffet breakfast to start the day (Variety is the same everyday however) - Large rooms with nice little extras such as coffee machine, washing machine, etc - Great place to stay if you are expecting visitors as there is an additional sofa bed in the lounge room - Wi-Fi Internet available (Was complimentary during our trip) - Large fridge and electronic safe in the apartment. Cons: - 10-15min walk from Termini Station, although close to the next station up on the Rome Metro - Hot water system was a bit off the mark. Hot water on the shower ran out quite quickly and it was hard to regulate to the right temperature - Walls are slightly thin. Could hear the young kids from next door.

When we arrived in Rome airport- we followed the signs for the airport shuttle bus (TerraVision) to the Termini main station. It cost 6 euros for a single. 40 minute journey into Rome. The bus drops on Via Marsala (which is the East side of the termini) Walk north, up the road, turn right on to the main road, and follow it down past the Conad Supermarket, then turn left on to Via Castelfidardo and the hotel is on the right, about 8 mins walk. Once at the hotel we were greeted very warmly, and our bags were carried to the apartments. There is another small supermarket on the way, and it is literally 5 mins walk away from the hotel. The apartments do have a crazy 70's lift- which is completely safe, tiny and fun. We were lucky, everyone closed the doors while we were there so we never had a problem. We had an apartment without a balcony (which was fine as it was October, although it was 22c!) If you want a balcony, it would be worth calling ahead and requesting one. Our apartment was compact but not small with dishwasher (tablets were left by cleaning lady for us) fridge, cooker, microwave, fridge and freezer, washing machine (no powder), iron and ironing board. safe (not big enough for lap top) Storage was great. No English channels on TV- but that\u2019s half the fun. There is washing up liquid, clothes and tea towels also. Coffee machine- with free fresh coffee every day and free bottled water. Beds were comfortable, had air con. As two girls travelling together we felt very safe- there is a telephone and you can ring the hotel is you need anything. The area is very safe. We went to the Italian restaurant next door- it was ok, not amazing but suited us well for one night as we didn't want to go far. There are some lovely cafe for breakfast and take away pizza slices around the corner. The metro is 3 mins away. You can walk everywhere in Rome, but We wanted to save our feet so used the metro to the Vatican, and to the Colssium station. Buy a 75min single ticket when you go there for 1 euro. This will get you to where you want to go. Buy the all-day travel card for 4 euros, if you\u2019re doing more than 2 journeys. Rome is very expensive! So having an apartment was fantastic as we could cook. Buying Wine and beer etc. is cheaper in the supermarket, and you can cook on the cooking hob or microwave. We made fab pasta dishes, bread, cheese, meats; take away pizza with salad and bottle of wine! Fraction of the cost from the restaurants. This made our entire holiday much cheaper than normal city breaks.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Gem\u201d", "Author": "AdelaideVera", "ReviewID": "UR120179489", "Content": "We stayed 6 nights in the apartment wing of Hotel Crosti.

We checked in at the Crosti Hotel who gave us some maps and guides, and also showed us the best Metro stops for the major tourist sites in the city. We were then taken by a member of staff to the apartments which was maybe 5 minutes away. She showed us how to use the lift which, as commented on by other reviewers, is tiny. We found the lift fine (and quite endearing) but it's worth noting that if somebody goes up in it and doesn't close the door then it won't come down so you would need to take the stairs. I think this happened once while we were there but if you can't go up stairs if necessary then this could be a problem. The apartment was very nice. It was made up of a kitchen/living area with sofa (which can be converted into a small bed), table and chairs and kitchen area with hob, large fridge, microwave, kettle, toaster etc and also had a door which opens onto the terrace. Not all apartments have a terrace, but 616 and 720 certainly do. 720 is on the top floor and has a huge terrace with views out to the mountains. The bedroom was a decent size with wardrobe, safe TV and another door to the terrace. There was also 1 pair of slippers (the disposable kind). The bathroom was spacious and very clean. In the bathroom there were towels of various sizes and a hair dryer. The apartment was cleaned every day and complementary bottles of water were left in the fridge which was a very nice touch. Breakfast can be had at the Crosti hotel for 5 Euros (as we booked room only) which was very nice indeed. It includes cereals, dried and fresh fruits, bread, pastries, cakes, fruit juices and hot drinks. The location of the apartments turned out to be fantastic during our short stay. The nearest Metro station is on the blue line (Castro Pretorio, I believe) can take you to the Termini station or you can follow it all the way to the Colosseum. It is just round the corner from the apartments. You can easily walk to the Termini in maybe 10 minutes, which can take you to other places. There are lots of little restaurants, cafes and pizza shops nearby to eat at/from as well as a couple of supermarkets where you can buy food and drink to have in the apartment. Other things worth mentioning: -We had WiFi internet access available which we bought at 3 Euro for 24 hours. 24 hours in this case is actually 24 hours of use as long as you remember to log out of the system as opposed to 9am on one day to 9am the next. -There is a phone in the room which is connected to all the apartments, the Crosti Hotel rooms and the hotel reception in case you need to ask anything. -If you have no outstanding payments (eg WiFi) you can leave the key in your room and don't have to check out, or at least you could when we stayed. -Some people we travelled with stayed in the hotel at the same time. I had a look inside their room to compare it. I'd say the quality of finish was slightly better in the hotel although obviously there wasn't the living/kitchen area. The water in the fridge wasn't free, but breakfast was included and you have the reception/staff available at the bottom of the stairs. I'd happily stay in either the hotel or the apartments again. -We didn't see the staff that much because we were so busy, but whenever we did they were always polite and helpful. All in all, this was a superb stay and very reasonably priced. The quality and location of the apartment were outstanding for the price paid, and the staff were all very nice. I would definitely recommend the apartments to anyone, with the possible exception of people who can't stand a tiny lift/can't manage lots of steps because you'll need to negotiate at least one of them.

Loved the space, kids loved the space (very important!), small market just down the street, restaurant (very good) right beside apartments. Everything all the reviews said.

We rented 2 that had adjoining terraces on the 6th floor, the view wasnt all that great but the fact that we could sit out in the evening and enjoy the great weather we had was wonderful. The terraces provided plenty of room with tables and chairs, flowerboxes with fresh flowers. The apt I had was huge for 2 people, it had 2 bedrooms, a large bathroom, and pretty big living area, which itself included a TV and DVD with a large selection of movies. The area that the apt is at, is perfect for getting around the city, Termini is 4 blocks away, and the metro is just a block away. Theres a bank and grocery 2 blocks away and 2 internet outlets very close as well. And as far as food and beverage, multiple choices within 2 block area, and 2 just right outside the front door of the apt. building. Or of course you could prepare your own, you have a kitchen, fully stocked with china and utensils. I did a whole lot of research before our trip, and location and price was high priority to our booking, and i tell you that if you have multiple people or even a couple, this place is a steal during the off season, you'll get twice the amount of room and a terrace if you choose for the same amount you would pay for almost any other hotel in all of Rome central. Book directly thru Hotel website, cut out the middleman, the staff at the Hotel Crosti are friendly and professional, and will give a discount coupon to a nice local restaurant nearby. P.S. The Hotel Crosti and the Crosti Apts. are managed by the same people but are 2 different locations, only separated by maybe 4 blocks, dont get confused during booking. If in an apt. you'll eat your breakfast over at the hotel, which was nice. And not all of the rooms at the Crosti Apts have terraces, just the top floors, so also be specific when booking on your preference. The hotel staff answered all my emails quite promptly. stickyTex", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sleaford, Lincolnshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value, good facilities, good breakfast\u201d", "Author": "TomSleaford", "ReviewID": "UR82354855", "Content": "We stayed for 5 nights in August and got the special rate of 100 euros per night for three in the apartment with Breakfast.

Originally the trip was only going to be two of us (myself and 13 yo daughter), but at the last minute, some friends decided to join us (another 13 yo and her mom). Since the apartment we had booked slept four, they joined us at the Crosti. Well, we had a blast and the Crosti apartment was perfect for us. The bedroom had a kingsize bed and the living area a double pullout sofabed, kitchen, and dining table. With two always-hungry kids in tow, we made good use of the kitchen! We also had a very nice outside terrace area that was perfect for evening meals/snacks and just general relaxing. The apartment was very clean and even had a washer in the bathroom. As others have mentioned, the apartments are a short walk away from the hotel and breakfast, as well as convenient to the subway, buses, and train station. There are several markets, banks, restaurants, laundromats, etc. in the area as well. We loved the small market just down the street from the hotel -- we bought wonderful cheeses, prosciutto, bread, wines, and olives there several times during our stay. If you stand in front of the hotel, with your back to the main entrance to the hotel, walk down the street directly in front of you and the market is just a block or two on your left. Highly recommended! It was so nice to have an apartment to return to after long days of sightseeing and the Crosti apartments are within easy reach of all the major sites. We had booked online and paid 120 euro/night which included breakfast. Also would like to mention as 2 women traveling alone with two teen girls, we felt safe and secure in the neighborhood, even when returning late at night, usually walking back from the bus stops at the train station. Would also like to give a shout out to Rome by Segway on Via Ostilia (near the Colosseum). My daughter and I had taken a Segway tour in another city and she was dying to do it again. Both girls (and moms!) had a great time. Check it out.

Negatives The apartment is in a building of various hotels apartments. The lift needs all doors closed when leaving or wont work (no sign saying this) so after a regular 6 flights of stairs to get to the apartment because the lift was unavailable I would not like to be ederly or have an injury. Such a simple thing as a multi laungage note would fix. Noise. Not external as its well sound proofed but internal from the stair wells and other apartments. Unit 16 has a \"door\"between it and apartment 18 that is only ply board thick and all conversations and particularly music could be heard from our neighbours and I assume from us.

That was fine with me although at first I wondered where the bellman was taking us. Up seven floors in the smallest elevator I have ever seen and into a little haven away from the hectic streets of Rome. We were so tired from the train ride when we got into Rome when I stepped out on the patio I was so glad to have a place to relax, and the weather was perfect too! The apartment suited the needs of my husband, son and I with a separate bedroom, kitchen area and living area. There is a grocery store, and I mean a big grocery, down about two blocks and you are a half- block from the metro. The building is safe and quiet. And it had a washing machine, no dryer but after being on the road six days that was a treat. A small drying rack on the patio, dried everything by the next afternoon, mind you our weather was perfect for 6 days in Rome!. I didn't think I booked with breakfast included but they said breakfast was and we did have our cappuccino and toast every morning but they had a full italian breakfast buffet. We bought our Roma pass right at the desk a must for the metro, bus, and skip the lines. And the internet was 3 euro for 24 hours usage, not a 24 hour day but a total usage of 24 hours which lasted my son the whole trip. Overall I loved the apartments and would definately do it again! My guys found this Ethiopian restaurant down about 3 blocks and they loved the Asmara, not me so much but hey I was in Rome!

What a GREAT stay and what great value! We really, really enjoyed our vacation. Although the apartment is situated around the corner from the actual Crosti Hotel itself (they own the top 3 floors and the building's lift), we had a very spacious room on the 6th floor which had a large kitchenette/sitting room area, very large bathroom with an average sized shower, but which had hot water on demand, and there was a lovely large double bedroom (with a double bed, NOT 2 x single beds shoved together). The lift worked very well, but be warned, it literally only holds 2-3 people, maximum, and is quite narrow. We took the express train from the airport into the Termini Station in Rome and the apartments are just a 5-10 min easy walk away. There are at least 2 supermarkets in easy reach of the apartment, and a really wonderful cafe/restaurant across the road that did a fantastic lunch for around 7 euro a head....tea and cappucino's were 1euro each, and a glass of wine with our meal was only 2.50 euro. Our stay in the apartment included breakfast at the main Crosti Hotel each morning, which was a lovely contintental breakfast consisting of cold meats, hard boiled eggs, cereals, cheeses, breads, croissants, fruits, etc. and a selection of cakes to choose from. We walked almost everywhere, it took about 25 mins or so to get to the Colleseum, and/or spanish steps, etc. but taxis were cheap...so when we got tired we just hopped in a taxi and it usually only cost around 4-7 euro...the most expensive taxi we took was from the Vatican back to the apartment which was around 12 euro. The Hotel is only open a few years, but they also own a family-run restaurant called \"Da Vincenzo's\" which they have run for 40 years, and is very large, beautifully decorated, full of atmosphere and was full of italian locals (always a great sign!)...and we had a great night there.....it is what I would consider to be mid-priced and we paid around 93 euro + tip for a 3 course meal, nice bottle of wine and coffees... We would highly recommend this restaurant, even if you are not staying at the Crosti! Da Vincenzo's is closed on Sunday nights and the Concierge recommended a nearby restaurant, which was absolutely gorgeous as well, however it only seats around 40 people, so unless you are eating out early, you would need to make a reservation. Everywhere was spotlessly clean, with our apartments being cleaned daily, with fresh towels etc. every day. We had such a great time during our stay in Rome and would definitely stay here again.
