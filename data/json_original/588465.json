{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Never again We stayed in Dewi Sri only because our dive shop operator included it as part of the dive package. I guess this is because its cheap and this is reflected in the quality of the rooms.When we first checked in, we were put in a ground floor room. The room is small and the toilet is dirty. The door to the toilet is not painted and it looks unfinished. The toilet bowl is dirty and the sink wouldnt drain. Worse, the water from the tap is grey/brownish. Only water from the basin is dirty, but the shower is OK. Whats more, the room is infested with mosquitoes. We killed about 8 but more kept coming. We asked for mosquito coils but they dont have that so they gave us insecticide instead. The mosquitoes were coming in from a gap under the door so we stuffed it with towels and sprayed insecticide on it and the mosquito problem stopped.The only redeeming factor of this place are the friendly staffs, but it couldnt make up for the awful 2 days we spend here.For this price, I believe there are better options around and I will definitely give Dewi Sri a miss the next time I am in Bali and I would not recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "Oct 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR923498408", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "brokenonends"}, {"Content": "rough diamond Stayed with daughter and granddaughter in June, nice grounds large pool but in need of some TLC.

I wrote a positive review after visiting this hotel last year and so much so that I made another reservation on my recent trip. Well, this time wasnt so pleasant. The room they put me in was very dirty. I thought I could stick it out but after finding out my tub wasnt draining at all, I just could not bear it anymore. I could have asked for another room but I could not stomach what I already experienced. I guess with this hotel, it is hit and miss depending on what room they put you in. While I was checking out after one night of stay, there was a someome from Sweden complaining about not having any hot water. The staff told her to leave the water on for 10 minutes. I am not sure about you, but no hotel is cheap enough for me to leave the water on for 10 minutes in order to get hot water.", "Date": "May 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR919884530", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "chungt79"}, {"Content": "Dewi Sri makes Bali Bagus Fourth time back at Dewi Sri.

Althought the hotel is not 4 or 5 star hotel, still, the friendliness, the personality service from the staff and the well location really worth for any of you to go and try.The 1st day when we checked in, quite surprise that the front desk staffs, Agung and the other male colleague, could speak very fluent english. And, after we saw the room and requested to change (due to the location), still, they were so kind to change for us immediately. (even though, at last, we still choose the first room that they reserved for us, ha..) And, on the 2nd day night, we decided to go and see the sunrise on the next day morning. Agung, so kind of him to arrange for us to go by the hotel transport in the early morning, 4.50am, drived by his the other male colleague (Of course, we got to pay a bit, but, we were so happy for it...) and we were really impressed for all the excellent service that they provided. Especially, when we were about to checked out, busied for shooting photo for each other, the staffs there were volunteer to take photo for two of us. it was not only one staff there, about all the staffs who passed by, were volunteer to help us. If you happen to stay there, feel free to send my regards to Agung and his male colleague there.

What a great place to stay and what a sobering thought, in all the hustle and bustle of Kuta, walking out on to Legian St every day and passing the monument to those who lost their lives, we are so glad we stayed there.It has got to be the best 3 star hotel in Bali. Our family of 6 + 2 friends stayed in Sept 2005 for 2 weeks. Why go to Bali for less than that.My wife and I had a huge family room with a king size bed with 2 of our girls in the other room separated by sliding doors, right up on the top floor. Make sure you get the bellboys to carry some of your luggage.The rooms were all great and the bathroom was a good size but it looked like it had been left to fend for itself.The rest of the group stayed in standard twin rooms which was very comfortable accommodation for them. Don't try and get an extra bed in the room as it gets very squashed.The restaraunt/pool area is great but can get a bit crowded sometimes, depending on the amount of guests but generally, you have no trouble getting a table or deck chairs.You walk up an alley way to get to Legian St and it has numerous stalls along the way, which will give you better prices the more you get to know them and they don't mind you stopping for a talk.The hotel is situated centrally to Kuta  Legian and most places are within walking distance if you want to, but taxi's are cheap and a good way to travel. Pay by the meter, don't barter a price.We are hoping to go again in 2007 and if we do, we will definitely stay there.
