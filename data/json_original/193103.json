She made the arrangements for where we would stay and the agenda of visits we'd be making to prospective Market research companies. So when she said we were booked into the Selfridge Hotel. My thoughts in order were, \"Wow thats cool\" and \"I'm glad I'm not paying\". Well after the trip I was 50% right, I was glad I didn't have to pay out of my budget, but \"cool\" it wasn't! First shock was car parking - I got directed to the adjacent multistorey, and paid around \u00a370 to park my car for 2 days! Then, when I went up to my room, having seen the rack rate, I thought, surely there must be some mistake and by accident somebody has given me the keys to a cupboard where they keep all the worn out discarded furniture! I checked again, and the number on the door was the right one. The room was tiny, and I can only describe it as grotty. If you've read any of my other reviews you'll know I'm not picky and am realistic about what to expect from a cheap hotel. Well, even if this was cheap I might have been a bit downhearted. But of course it wasn't cheap, it was VERY expensive, especially for what it was. My colleague told me her room was similar, and I had to assure her that wasn't typical by UK standards, and I also felt ripped off. I filled in the \"comments slip\" and handed it in when we checked out, but looking at other reviews on tripadvisor, it looks like nobody read it! We did however have a good time, the business side went well, and we selected a MR company that did a good job for us, and in the evening we just stayed in the vicinity of the hotel, ate at the Spaghetti House Restaurant just over the road, which was nice, and did a bit of local pub crawl (Jan wanted to experience some British pubs), and we ended up in a pub with kareoke. Very amusing! I was also impressed by her capacity for beer, especially of the warm British variety! So, we had a good time and profitable business trip despite the hotel. Read my other reviews, I seldom give bad ones, but this really really was not value for money, or even pleasant but expensive, it was expensive and disappointing!", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "ireland", "Title": "\u201cterrible, faded, must have been nice a long time ago\u201d", "Author": "travelingdd", "ReviewID": "UR25160318", "Content": "Nice lobby but otherwise very scruffy and a bit grubby-our curtain fell off on the first night.

Only to find out that our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready! After waiting for 15 minutes we asked again and were told that they were quite busy tonight but they would soon get us a room. 30 minutes later we were told that they were overbooked and doing their best. 45 minutes later they promised to get us a room in a hotel in the area. An hour later they got us a room in Hilton Tower Bridge. They were willing to pay for the cabs that would take us to Central London and back everyday, but this was out of the question! After a huge argument we accepted to stay at the Hilton for the night and then get back to a junior Suite at the Selfridge! The time was some minutes after 7 and my mom had a business appointment at 7.30 near Piccadilly Circus, which of course she missed! Anyway, we took a cab to Hilton, had dinner and went to bed quite tired, disappointed and frustrated! The next day we checked in our Junior Suite. It couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be more Junior! It was as spacious as a standard room in Hilton Metropole or Thistle Marble Arch! There were complimentary slippers and bathrobes which weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed during our 6 nights stay! There were also more toiletries than in a standard twin room, which makes me wonder: do people who stay in standard rooms need less soap??? The central heating wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working and there was a portable radiator that was supposed to heat the room (yeah, right)! There was a quite noticeable leak in the bathroom!, two of the lights in the room weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working, the space in the closet was taken by a portable air-conditioner and the mini-bar was empty (and stayed that way because we were unwilling to pay to fill it up)! Also, there was no kind of soundproof and we could hear everything that happened inside the room (and bathroom) next door, on the street (although we were on the 7th floor) and the construction works on the building across the street! Breakfast: Nightmare! For 6 days I ate half my breakfast with no toast and no coffee! We asked politely, we asked rudely, we yelled, we screamed, we begged, we pleaded there was no way we were getting our toast and coffee on time! Also, the restaurant where breakfast is served is too small and there is always a queue! This queue on Saturday was that big that we had to wait for 40 minutes to get seated! By that time there was no white bread, and our toast wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just late, it was not what we wanted either! At that day, we got up to take some more juice and when we returned we found a waiter taking our plates, although our things were still on the chairs! The funny thing with breakfast was that every day there was something missing! First day it was butter, the next it was ketchup, another day it was raspberry jam, then fruit salad and white bread, one day it was even Cumberland sausages! Reception: Maybe they were doing their best, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even close to enough! They weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to neither understand nor speak English! Once, I asked for a piece of paper and it took them 5 minutes to get me one! When we checked in we were promised a late check out. When we mentioned it the day prior to our departure there was no knowledge of that fact. After a small debate, a very rude and unpleasant girl said ok. The next morning, when we finished breakfast and went up to the room, our key cards weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working. When we went down to the reception we discovered that the same rude and unpleasant girl had cancelled our cards. Housekeeping: Does anybody speak English? First of all I must say that our room was always clean and tidy and it was the only good thing at this hotel! BUT, there was no way to communicate with housekeeping staff! On the first day I had to pretend I was brushing my teeth to get them to understand I was asking for a toothbrush! On the third day, a young girl asked me \u00e2\u20ac\u0153would you like your room serviced now?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and I answered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Could you please come back in one hour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? Guess what she replied!!!! \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No English\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd! If someone spent some time to teach her to ask a question (the answer to which she wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to understand, unless it was yes or no) couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they at least teach her to say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am sorry, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak English\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? Room Service: Is anybody there? We used it twice. The first time it took them a while to answer the phone. The second time, the phone was ringing, then the line went straight to reception and I was told that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we will try to locate them\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd! It took them 30 minutes to locate them and it took us 30 minutes to find out that what we wanted wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available (it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t white toast and coffee, in case you wonder)! Porter: Nice decoration! They opened the door for me twice, although almost every time I was carrying bags! Not even once I got asked if I wanted them to get my bags up to my room! Overall, the only good thing about this hotel is its location! Another plus was housekeeping but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how that would be if we were staying in a standard room! And, in case you were wondering, of course we complained about most of the things mentioned above! I even gave them in writing the problems of the room!

Reception staff were surly but to the point, and we got served pretty quickly. Then we found our way to the room. Oh ..... my .......god! Small is not the word, it hasn't been redecorated since the 80's, no central heating, bedding was awful, but the bathroom was the worst. A light fitting was hanging out over the bath and the grime was so caked in you'd have to remove all the fittings.

It is well located just off Oxford Street, about 10 minutes walk from Marble Arch tube station, although I had a little difficulty finding the hotel as from the outside it is called The Selfridge Hotel, with no reference to it being part of the Thistle Hotels group (my reservation stated: Thistle Selfridge). Once inside, I had to wait about 10 minutes for someone to attend to me at Reception, but was treated very well once someone appeared. Having supposedly being booked a double room by our company agents, Russell Hotel Reservations, I was a little dismayed to find that I had a single room. On returning to Reception, I was assured that I had only been booked a single despite the fact that my reservation form stated a double \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not sure who was to blame, but the hotel did instantly offer me a free double upgrade, however it never materialised as none were available. (I know this was true as another guest had the same problem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c moral here is, I think, to check a couple of days before you arrive to confirm the room of your choice is as booked!). Next issue for me was the room lights. Once in the room, there are two light switches by the entrance door, one is for the entrance lobby and one is for the bathroom; however, with the room in virtual darkness, I could find no switch for the rest of the lights! After calling Reception (there was a phone in the bathroom), I found the switches on the front face of the bedside table, not \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcusual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 place (moral here is to get shown to your room by a porter!). I used Room Service for a meal (\u00c2\u00a35 service charge!); food was ok, although it could have been hotter. Selfridges Food Hall is next door which offers several eating places and there is a large Marks and Spencer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 store opposite which sells food and alcohol. Whilst all this sounds a little negative, the air conditioned room was very comfortable, clean and well equipped. WiFi Internet access was available at cost. Breakfast was served in the light and airy Orchard Terrace; very nice, except for rather watery orange juice. Additionally, I thought milk for cereals was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, pleasingly it was replaced instantly, without question, when I mentioned it to waitress. Check-out was ok; but when I wanted a taxi, the Concierge, who had earlier boasted he could get a taxi in 1 minute, was no where to be seen; flagged down my own in the end.

I have never been impressed by the Thistle chain, but as this is attached to the upmarket and stylish Selfridges store, I hoped it might be different. It wasn't. I stayed here on business with two colleagues and we were all seriously unimpressed with every aspect of our stay. The rooms were very tatty, with wallpaper peeling off the walls and threadbare carpet. Most uncomfortably, all rooms were incredibly hot. We complained to reception and were offered other rooms with temporary air-con units, but we were warned that these would be very noisy as the pipes from the units had to feed out of the window. One colleague opted for noisy over hot, I went for a fan and some complimentary water and our other colleague checked in too late to be moved. He had to go for a walk around the block at 1am as his rooms was just too hot to sleep in. We arrived late and so (against our better judgement) decided to have a drink and a bite to eat in the hotel. The bar seems to have been refurbed more recently than the rest of the hotel, but there was still brown sludge all over the windows and burn holes in the furniture. The bar is very limited in choice and is as overpriced as the hotel in general. My drink was served complete with a long, curly hair and when I pointed this out to the barman, and he simply smiled and fished it out with his fingers. He looked at me with amazement when I suggested that maybe he'd like to provide me with a fresh drink, without hair. The restaurant looked a little better than the rest of the hotel, but the food was decidedly average and very expensive for what it was. The wine was awful. The staff were rude and unhelpful. When we spoke to them about the fact our rooms were very hot they said 'yes, well we don't advertise that we have aircon'.

When I found out where I was staying, I checked online for reviews and got very nervous after reading several on this site and others, but since I had already paid for 7 nights, figured I was stuck. So I was pleasantly surprised when I got to the hotel. Check-in, concierage and room service staff were all very courteous. I was put in a room with two twins instead of one double, but booking on Priceline I never requested one or the other. Room was a bit on the small side, but what room in a European hotel isn't? Room and bathroom were impeccably clean and well-maintained (no mold like other posters claimed - maybe it's been repaired or maybe I got lucky), halls were well maintained and looked updated enough (I was on the third floor) and everything was quiet at night, nice Thistles bathrobes waiting, good enough selection as far as TV channels (basic five UK stations, CNN, a 24hr BBC news and a couple others as well as some pay per view movies). I did have a portable air conditioner which took up space and didn't work so well. It was hot one day and I put it on - the heat exhaust in the back seemed to counteract the cool air in the front - but otherwise there was no need to use it (if you go during the summer I'd be careful and request a room with central air if there are any). Winter all should be fine. Plenty of closet space, safe for your valuables, and excellent location (minutes walk to Bond Street or Marble Arch tube stations, Hyde Park, and plenty of buses running along the main artery of Oxford Street). As I said, I only paid $95 (50 quid or so) using Priceline. Obviously its central location makes it worth more. Had I paid the published rates of >115GBP, I might have not felt so good about the place. But I always feel it's the small minority that have bad experiences who post on these sites.

When I telephoned and booked, I asked about parking and was told that although the hotel did not have parking, there was an NCP next to the Marble Arch Thistle at which all Thistle guests got cheaper parking. When we arrived we discovered that this was not the case and had to pay the full price. I had booked a basket of fruit and wine for arrival, however arrived to neither. I had to telephone reception 3 times before it arrived and even then there was no corkscrew. There was also only one bathrobe and despite my extensive requests over the next day, another one never materialised. The room was meant to be an executive deluxe room but was no better and was probably even worse than your standard bed and breakfast. The bed was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in, and was certainly not deluxe. The room was old and tired and not that we were there to watch tv, but the channel selections were poor. We were also told when we booked, and this was backed up by the hotel documentation in the room that there was a fully stocked mini bar. When we arrived it was not stocked and despite requests, we were told that this could not be done. We therefore had to order drinks from room service with a service charge attached, or go to the bar to buy drinks. Again, this was not what we expected. The breakfast in the hotel is definitely not worth hanging around for and would suggest that you give it a miss. Although we arrived in plenty of time before breakfast ended, the pastries and bread were stale and nothing else looked particularly appetising. The staff were also extremely rude. I would also not advise ordering room service. Having arrived back at the hotel after a night at the theatre, we did not expect to wait from 11pm until 1.10am for a very basic snack. Even though we chased the room service people, after 12am they stopped answering the phone and this was unacceptable. When the food did eventually arrive, it was nothing special and my lemon tart was missing. When we finally checked out on the Sunday I was very glad to leave. Although it was not the most expensive hotel I have stayed at, it was certainly far to pricy for the service that was received. However, to give Thistle credit, I did complain about the weekend and they wrote an offered a weekend staying in one of their suites with a complimentary bottle of champagne - not sure whether I'm going to take them up on their offer but goes to show that if somethings not up to scratch its worth commenting on it.", "Date": "July 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cGood for Spring\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5039217", "Content": "When we arrived, our room was not ready; we were told they needed 20 minutes to prepare the room!

It is in Central London, a few blocks away from the Bond Street or Marble Arch tube; getting around was quick and easy. The area, Oxford St, is like 5th Ave in NYC; full of dept stores, very touristy and crowded, but a few blocks away is some peace and quiet and lovely shops.

As we hadn't visited London previously, and after combing through an overload information on other places and not being able to make a decision, we decided to take a chance, stay at the Selfridge and see what happened. Our flight was scheduled to arrive at 5:30am so we booked a room for the previous evening so we could have a room as soon as we arrived in London (could not normally check in until 2pm). We had confirmed that we would not be arriving until the morning after the evening we booked. We confirmed this at least three times. With our 16 month old son (yes - a toddler on a long haul flight and he was amazing!) we arrived at the hotel after a 35 hour door to door trip. We were tired, really, really tired. And we were told that our room booking was cancelled since we hadn't arrived the night before. I started crying, the baby started crying and husband was stunned. They quickly arranged another room for us and I think they sped this up as sobbing Australians in the foyer area was not a good look for the hotel. We got to our room and crashed, slept through until the next day. The bathroom door didn't shut and the king size bed was actually two single beds pushed together, not practical for a distressed toddler who would most likely need to share our bed in a strange city. After explaining our needs the next day, staff at reception performed absolutely outstandingly! They booked us into the best room in the hotel for our entire stay, it was three times as big as the current, and we were more than happy, we were thrilled! Even if we had to stay in the small room, we would have managed had it only been the two of us, sure it was small, but clean and quiet. Overall the staff were so very friendly, quick to our room for any requests, always smiling and polite. Oh, and breakfast was great! The host in the restuarant at breakfast was a lovely fella and we really looked forward to seeing his happy face each morning. He always made us feel at home and that the food spread everywhere afterward by our toddler was no problem whatsoever. And the restaurants behind the hotel - absolutely fantastic: Indian, Thai, French bakery, Italian, English, so, so much! The smoking in restuarants threw us a bit since this is not allowed in Australia. Marks and Spencer across the road and the Selfridges deli next door with amazing food to take back and eat in your room for a quiet night in. Actually, the Selfridges store could have taken the entire week to explore itself. So much to do within Oxford street and pushing a pusher (pram) around the streets no problem, could walk to the palace, wax museum, Hamleys, Picadilly etc most famous landmarks.

My understanding is that having reception open for 24hrs is in itself enough to earn you one star; as does having a bar. The stars do not relate to the quality of the furnishings or the standard of service. And this is where the Selfridge falls flat on its face. To me, 4 Stars should smack of high quality, and you have to hand it to the Thistle group, they make the very most of the categorisation - whilst offering very competitive rates. We paid \u00c2\u00a380 for a double room on a B&B basis, which is great value for London. The problem is, they raise the customer's 'expectation' via the four star status.

The general feeling is that the Thistle Group purchase decent hotels but have nothing left in the coffers (or cream it all off as profit) to spend on general repair or maintenance. Presumably business is good enough to allow them to ignore any attempts to attract repeat bookings. The room we were allocated was 211. The bathroom, although clean, was in a very poor state of repair and the shower didn't work at all. The bed was large and comfortable, but the noise from outside kept me awake all night.

The food at the Selfridge was great, including breakfast, and dinners. But this is a personal \"tasters choice'. I happen to like plain food.

The rooms are small, and you should upgrade to business class. As with any standard room, in any country, let's just say the rooms are not always that great. The location is fantastic. Trust me. When you can't get a taxi or bus back from the theatre, you will be very happy the hotel is within walking distance, albeit a little far, but managable, even if you are out of shape. My room had a mini refrigerator, but you must remember, in Europe, a refridgerator is considered a cooler, not like in America where you can set it to zero.

Our experiences were not much different than others have reported. The hotel was a quick ride from Paddington Station. Check-in was smooth and efficient. The desk clerk had a great sense of humor and actually smiled when joked with. We were assigned a room on one of the \"Business Floors.\" The front lobby of the hotel is small with only two pairs of chairs. It's not a good lobby to use as a meeting point. The hotel's elevators seem to be possessed by a playful spirit of some kind. The doors close quickly, the doors open before the vertical movement has stopped and they seem to sometimes head in a direction other than indicated. We noticed that the 1st floor carpet and furniture in the lounge was somewhat worn. The bar (Stoves) was utterly charmless with only Boddingtons and Stella Artois on tap. Happily, the appetizers we ordered (Garlic Bread with Cheese and Onion Rings) were fine although not gourmet. The restaurant looked awful and the menu was filled with items that seemed more adventurous than the setting dictated. The tea in the lounge seemed really popular and the lounge also did a brisk business in coffee in the evening. Our room was small. We have come to expect this in London hotels. We had a room facing the inner courtyard, so there was no street noise. We had a non-smoking room but the smell of smoke would often come through the ventilation system. Our room had a completely redone bathroom, which was done to a fairly high standard compared to others I have been in. All black and white tiles. There was little counter space but the quality of light was excellent. We particularly liked the large and plentiful towels. This was a welcome change from some other hotels. The room's closet was less satisfactory. The closet had fixed hangers and these were a bit worn-out, so the heavy coats kept pulling the hangers off the bar. The double bed was comfortable and the linens seemed fresh and new. The pillows were a bit flat but were feather pillows. The room was provided with a safe, coffee/tea tray and kettle, and a small refrigerator (formerly a mini-bar). There were hairdryers in both the bathroom and the dresser. Drawers were in short supply. The TV worked fine but had very few additional channels (5 broadcast stations, 4 pay-movie channels, Bloomberg, News, and some radio stations). The housekeeping staff was good at making the room up IF you remembered to put out the \"Service Room\" sign. The breakfast room was very crowded and they were not very attentive about coffee/tea/toast or about refilling items on the buffet. On the plus side, there were both scrambled and fried eggs, bacon and sausage, grilled tomatoes and mushrooms, yogurt, cereal, fruit, multiple juices, ham and cheese, and a few other items. It was a robust and filling breakfast. The best thing about the Selfridge is the location. The bus lines are all right there for getting to wherever you want to go.

From the moment I arrived at the Hotel the problems started. Two receptionists were on duty and both ignored me, then one looked up and asked the other to help me - the other said she would be a few minutes as she needed to finish something. When she eventually served me she said that although I had booked a double non-smoking she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any but could give me a smoking room - eventually I got a twin non-smoking. The check in procedure took much longer than necessary as she kept wondering off to do other things and then forgot she had asked me for my credit card.....The room itself was small but okay with dated but adequate decor and it was clean. Bathroom was tiny but clean. I then had to leave the Hotel to go out and asked the concierge to get a taxi for me - he disappeared and never came back so I found one myself. On my return to the Hotel I ordered room services which was fine and came within half an hour. The bed was one of the most uncomfortable I have slept in and I had one of the worst nights sleep ever in a Hotel. Someone, at 2am in the morning, was ringing the doorbells on my floor on and off for about 10 minutes. I then heard security come up onto the floor and the ringing stopped but this together with an uncomfortably hot room made for a terrible nights sleep. (There is aircon but the control was broken). The last straw was when my room service breakfast didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t arrive! I checked out and came to work for breakfast!

We were 10 mins early for check-in and other guests were being told their room wasn't ready - we checked in and were immediately given a single room - not what we'd requested! I'd already confirmed a double room beforehand so after a quick check the receptionist gave us a key card (no wait for us!) to a room on the business floor. The room itself wasn't huge but it was comfortable and clean. The bathroom was spotless - not a mould mark or broken plug in site (as per some photos on here).
