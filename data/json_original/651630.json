The room was a bit on the small and basic side but it was functional, clean, quiet and the beds were very comfortable. What really made the hotel was (a) the very helpful staff (b) the excellent and very reasonable restaurant with the most fantastic views of the Bosphorus and (c) the view from our small but perfectly formed balcony. Would definitely stay there again. A ferry port at Besiktas is a fairly short (but steep) walk away, about 20 mins, and the fantastic area of Ortakoy where there are numerous restaurants etc, is also within walking distance - maybe 35-40 mins. Taxis are OK price-wise but the traffic most of the day is unbelievably heavy so journeys can be extremely slow. Great shower and good wee hairdryer. Mini bar prices are reasonable. The local area is very residential and there is a mosque at the end of the road so you get to wake up at about 5am to the sound of the call to prayer. We loved it. A couple of things would make this even better - tea/coffee making facilities in the room would have been nice, and a couple of small chairs on the balcony would be the icing on the cake.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maastricht, the Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel in residential area\u201d", "Author": "RobertRx", "ReviewID": "UR115345246", "Content": "We were here with a group of people who came to Istanbul for a congress and business meeting. All of us liked the hotel. Human scale, friendly staff, restaurant view a great view, and excellent food. The location on a rather steep hill keeps visitors fit. What could be improved: baby crib and chair. All in all, a very positive experience.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Starbucks", "Title": "\u201cGem of a small boutique hotel.

The service was wonderful. The staff was great and very personable. I went to Istanbul with a little concern about this hotel, since I have never stayed at a small hotel, but this was worth every penny. The front lobby staff was courteous and friendly. They did exactly what we told them to do. They helped us with any language barriers and communicated efficiently. The hotel is located on avery steep hill and can cause a little pain but the taxis were able to access the hotel without any problems. The view from the terrace is AMAZING. Great photos and worth a visit. Breakfast was decent but the same for daily routine. ighly recommend this small and cozy place. The beds were also very comfortable. A big shout out to all the staff including the following members - Nur, Ipek, Irem, Haydar, Nuh and others. Nur speaks english and is very friendly and courteous. But generally, all were amazing staff.", "Date": "May 11, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "La Maison Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d651630-Reviews-La_Maison_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$158 - $236*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Muvezzi Caddesi No 63</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">C&Auml;&plusmn;ragan - Besiktas</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34349</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "651630", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/70/fe/70fea5437eeb4bbae6f8776381dd60f71large.jpg"}}
