Very close to SL Train station which is ideal when you arrive late at night by train and have to drag your case to the hotel. It was very very easy to find. From there it's then easy to get round Venice from Arcadia. There is a water bus station nearby or you can easily walk to S Marco which I would highly recommend. On our second day we decided to go for a stroll along the Grand Canal, ended up wandering down some lovely little alleys and before we knew it we were back at our hotel. It was a very enjoyable and beautiful walk. The hotel is open 24 hours so very convenient. I should imagine that the bedrooms would get very hot in Summer as there is no air con and only a fan in the rooms. We were there in September and with the temperatures at around 28 - 30 degrees it was bearable - any hotter and you could find it a bit uncomfortable. The rooms were basic but spacious. The bed was a little tatty but comfortable and clean. The bathroom was a good size and clean. The hotel wasn't too noisy at night, we had a room just down from Reception and it was a bit loud when the phone rang or when people arrived - but this didn't really trouble us during the night. Best part of the hotel has to be the breakfast room. It was amazing. Beautiful Venetian room and to top it off probably the best breakfast we had in Italy. It was a help yourself buffet of cereal, coffee, croissants and breads/jams etc and as you could take as much as you liked we found it filled us up for the day.

The room is certainly big enough and perfectly adequate with a good bathroom. The hotel is clean and although it doesn't have aircon, we found the fan in the room was absolutely fine - and Venice was really stinking hot when we were there. The breakfast is typical continental style with breads and yogurts etc, but more than adequate to start the day, and served in an absolutely beautiful breakfast room, really reminiscent of old Venice.

The water buses run from around 6am to midnight, and tickets were: 6.50 Euros for a single trip, 16 Euros for 24hr use, 21 Euros for 36hr use, etc). Either the No1 or No82 water buses took us to the San Marcolo stop. Even though it was 11.30pm it was very warm.

The hotel reception is open 24hrs, the keys were waiting for us (ask for a safe key at reception free of charge).

A market was right outside the hotel selling fruit & vegetables. We explored the area before hitting the Grand Canal & it was so beautiful. I will leave you to explore the fasinating city of Venice & you will not be dissappointed. The Murano water bus also left from around the corner of the hotel at the Guglie stop.
