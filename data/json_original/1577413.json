The bathroom was also a fine size with a great shower with always hot water and beautiful tiles. The breakfast was fine, but they need something more then just eggs. Music was played till late almost every night, but you know that before you stay there. . The roof top has seating and a shallow pool if you prefer rather then the beach, we went to the beach daily. We went to Kool Beach Club next door to Mamitas on 28th and the beach, a close walk. Only problem is at 1 they play loud techno house music and if you want silence forget it. A few nights some people that left the bar late were yelling to their friends and that woke us up. The darkening shades made it easier also to sleep. We slept well most of the nights and we are light sleepers. The management was really nice and Dave took care of anything we needed. They had beach towels for us and everything is really close by. I would stay here again and found it to be very reasonable since we did book it through Orbitz.

Rooms were clean and tidy, breakfast was good and the staff very nice and professionnal. Only downside to this hotel is the lack of sleep...

The bar on the main floor has a great atmosphere and good music, and the rooftop patio has a beautiful pool with parties on Sundays where ladies get free drinks. The overall attitude of the place is very laid back, and we felt completely at home. This is a perfect place to stay if you want to enjoy the night life in Playa del Carmen - it is right in the centre of the main strip - just look for the glowing red building.

The whole hotel is decorated in reds and deep wood finishes. It looks really cool. They play DJ dance remixes throughout the public spaces during the day. At night they have live dj's playing the \"lobby/bar\" area. The main floor of the property is sprinkled with comfortable couches and beds. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Most guests get the free breakfast which is fine for the money. Don't expect much, but it is fine. I had a jr. suite which was of good size. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was a bit small, but ok. The best part of the room was the bath amenities of organic soaps and shampoos made with bee honey. Smelled great. And the mini bar filled with waters, juices, and lots of Red Bull (all free). Nice sized flat screen TV, but only 4 english speaking channels, but its Mexico and the networks are for the locals. Free wifi throughout the property was nice. Good views from the rooftop pool area. The bad: None of the red lights in my room worked and the maintenance guy could not fix them. No big deal as I probably would not have used them, but they should work. The pool on the roof which looks like a lap pool is actually only a foot deep for 3/4 and then only about 3 feet deep at the far 1/4 deep end. Bar on the roof only open when they have parties going on, but you can get drinks from the lobby bar and bring them to the roof yourself. On the weekends they have a rooftop party which is cool, but the music plays until 3am and the bass reverberates through the walls into your room. So unless you are up on the roof it can be hard to sleep. On the main floor the floor itself is actually elevated above a water feature that flows underneath and into small pools and fountains. Sounds great right? Well it wasn't working and was mostly drained and has become a mosquito breeding ground. I killed four mosquitos one evening as I sat and drank a beer and three more at breakfast. I have a ton of bites on my legs and arms. I did not see or swat a mosquito anywhere else in Playa del Carmen. General: The location is good, a few blocks from the beach. If you go to the beach go to Mamitas beach club. For a small fee you get a towel, lounge chair and umbrella. They have good food and service for all your needs with very clean bathrooms and a pool. The hotel is right off 5th avenue, the main tourist street with most restaurants and nightclubs. There are better hip hotels to choose from so if this hotel interests you please compare to Deseo, In Fashion, and Mosquito Blue. All are within the same area but are a bit nicer.
