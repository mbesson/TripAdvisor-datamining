{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Baleka Beach Resort- July 2008 i read the reviews already posted before i went to bali (to the baleka) and am now posting my impression of the hotel.My boyfriend and i went with two other couples(all between the ages of 20-22).We had originally booked two standard and one superior room for two weeks. When we got there, there was only one standard and one superior room available ,so my partner and i were upgraded for the night to a deluxe suite.(which was fine by us!!!)We checked the rooms, and i' m not sure if they just gave us the bad rooms, but i would NOT book to stay in the standard rooms!We had twin single beds, it was pretty dark, it smelt and the bathrooms..well not a pleasent sight. We booked budget and expected budget but didnt expect that.!. The superior rooms are pretty good.. And the deluxe suites are really nice!!!!!!!!!!we ended up paying more money  shared a deluxe suite with another couple for the whole time..plenty of room  modern(bali modern)The staff are very nice..One review said they tried to pick the locks of there bags, i dont think they would have done that.. we locked all our valubles away too most of the time on occasions we didn't and not one thing went missing....But to tell the truth i dont really think the front reception knew what was going on half the time...Whilst we were there, two other parties didnt even have rooms to come over to.  About the pool and i found it beautiful  clean..True the swim up pool bar doesnt have an attendent at anytime of the day( i think it didnt even have drinks behind it..) but all u had to do was ask at the bar behind it, or catch a hotel staff and ask them.. it wasnt a big deal..The only thing that annoyed me sometimes was fellow travellers who put there towel on a pool chair in the morning then leave for the day so they had a chair when they came back.(as there is only 20 odd chairs available)there are no bed bugs????? there were mozzies though so take RID!I only ate in the resturaunt once.the free breakfast is pretty average.(if you really want to try only get you eggs scrabbled )once was enough. but there are plenty of better places to eat-try the outrigger hotel on legian beach!...the beach really isnt that far away, there is a alley way that is a shortcut if u just ask someone it does cut the walk down quite abit..overall if i would stay here again(which i wouldnt- purely as i would be to nervous before knowing if they have us down to check in or not..) i would ONLY stay in the superior/deluxe suites and please check - even RING the hotel yourself and make sure they know your going.!!!!!.. Be sturn and get it across that you expect your room ready....Then all i can say is pray it works out......I hope this helps someone, we read many conflicting reviews before we went to bali, i understand everyone has their own opinion so here is mine... free for your use!p.s you should try to go to nusa lembongan island (use the fun ship for transfers) and stay at coconuts resort, its not that expensive but definalty worth it!!!!!!!!!!!i will try and post pictures asap...Courtney", "Date": "Jul 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR159590370", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Kiesha59"}, {"Content": "Hated it.........
