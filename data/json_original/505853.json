{"Reviews": [{"Content": "simple, sensible - and cheap! I've stayed here many times, since it was almost new. The rooms are tiny, so for a westerner with some luggage I'd book a semi-double not a single. The bathrooms are unit baths, prefabricated shower/bath/sink/toilet, very common in Japan, like 'em or hate 'em. They have clever toilets, again very common in Japan, to which my butt is seriously addicted (hot water at high pressure, shooting up....oh, never mind). Tea making facilities in the room, good free internet. And cheap for what is a very uptown location. The staff are, well, Japanese - polite, efficient, helpful, but inflexible (don't try to check in half an hour early, or ask them to send a letter for you...)Apart from the size, the downsides are few, except that the hotel's not well maintained. It was simple and clean and fresh while it was new, now it's simple and clean but a bit scruffy, and deteriorating rapidly. It's not unpleasant, but no longer a treat to stay there. And given the glut of hotel rooms in Tokyo, for 20%-30% more you could find a hotel of international standard equally centrally.There's a restaurant attached to the lobby, but don't bother. In the evening you've dozens of local places that are cheaper, better, and nicer, within 5 minutes walk, and for breakfast, the family restaurant (Denny's?) between the hotel and Hiroo underground station is much better, and better value.However if you're on a really tight budget but you need to be somewhere respectable and central (well, West, actually, but that's where a lot of what you're likely to want to do in Tokyo is located), this place will work. It's a chain, BTW, so you'll find the APA experience in several Japanese cities", "Date": "Aug 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR486365873", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "hoboesque"}, {"Content": "DO NOT STAY HERE! This hotel is not suited for people who have large families or who have more than one small luggage! This hotel is located in downtown tokyo, but it's extremley small! There is no room for any luggages here..it's for people who don't need space. I have no way of explaining how small the rooms are here. All the rooms are one size and it's so small that you think the bathroom is the one on the airplane. i am being serious. The tag on the shower says Please Do Not Leave The Bathroom Door open Because the Steem Will Set Off the Fire Alarm!! The rooms are so small that the steem could set off the fire alarm. I could tell you something though this hotel was the funniest part of our trip! My husband and I only stayed here for 2 nights and then when to the Royal park Hotel which was amazing! I think i will talk about this hotel for years to come.The hotel does have a fridge, a TV, and free internet access, i don't reccomend this hotel unless you really don't care about space.", "Date": "Nov 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR955690739", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "alig016"}, {"Content": "Typical Tokyo Hotel This APA hotel was perfectly adequate. Air conditioning did work, hi-speed internet access was free, clean pj's provided daily. Only complaint would be the dirty carpets in the hallways and rooms.

The Apa Hotel Nishi Azabu turned out to be an extremely pleasant surprise. It really portrays an image of what Tokyo is all about. Let's start by the location. First of all i'd like to say that it's kind of hard to define downtown or city center in Tokyo, because the city really has many of them (Shibuya, Shinjuku, Roppongi, Ginza). Being that said the hotel is located in NIshi Azabu which is about 5 minutes away from the Tokyo metro station of Hiroo. Roppongi (one of Tokyo's main areas of interest)is a short walk away (i'd say 10 minutes) and if you feel like walking a little bit more you can easily make it to Aoyama (Omotesando) in about 20 minutes. The hotel is way better than any 3 star hotel you'd get in Europe or in the U.S. The staff is friendly and helpful, the rooms are extremely clean, provided with internet connection, tv, dvd player etcetera. There are only two minor downsides about the hotel. Number 1 is that the rooms are really really small, and if you have heavy suitcases with you it might be actually quite hard to move them around your room. But then again hotel rooms are small in Japan (unless you are staying at a 5 star). Number 2 is that if you check in before scheduled time, they will charge you about 2000 extra yen, even if the room is ready. Not a big deal but it's worth a mention.Overall this hotel is a gem and i honestly recommend it to everybody visiting Tokyo whether on business or on a vacation. I loved it and i will be back.", "Date": "Dec 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR303642472", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Ichiban80"}, {"Content": "\u6e1a\u57ae\u57c4   showReview(23282428, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 5, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR786058678", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ayuuuuuuu"}, {"Content": "\u7ed4\u5b2a\u6e74\u9287\ue1ba\u5027\u9288\u5a3f\u4f00\u9287\ue21a\u7568\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(19074304, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR645574845", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "FLPJCF2M"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066451-d505853-r19452394-APA_Hotel_Nishi_Azabu-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "505853", "Price": "$192"}}
