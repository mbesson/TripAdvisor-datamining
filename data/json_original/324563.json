Breakfast was your normal continental affair but well presented, with lots of coffee available. They have evidently learnt from past experience as food was well covered up and moved. Rooms are what you expect for a budget city hotel, reasonably large and quite comfortable with a very crowded bathroom. Beds were very good although sheets were a bit strange at first. The quality of workmanship was poor, with holes and wonky sockets, but it doesn't affect the room really. Only real downsides were lack of extra pillows that made sitting on bed difficult, and erratic heating. TV is very small and high so you would need to lie down to watch it, not that we did.

They were more than willing to help us find stuff to do. *Price wasn't that reasonable, but understandable I guess given location & season *My favorite part: going downstairs @ midnight to by a \"Coke Light\" from the receptionist, who was sleeping across three lobby chairs w. a little blanket ! *My mom called the hotel to talk to me, prompting the receptionist to run up three flights of stairs to bang on the door w. the cordless phone in her hand =) The room: small beds, looks like the kind of place someone might off themselves in .. otherwise, liveable --- but the view is a brick wall thru metal bars; the bathroom door hit the TV, & you have to sit on the toilet sideways. The view from the lobby, however is quite nice. Also, a pigeon went on & on for awhile, & we thought it was the people next door having sex. Oooops.

I was glad I secured lodging at this hotel while staying in Amsterdam. Plan ahead, because Amsterdam is a hot-spot for people to come to. Since I traveled in July, vacancy was almost non-existent everywhere I looked. This hotel is very, very accessible to the tram system because it's on Rokin downtown. My friend and I arrived in short time from the Central train station and found the hotel with no trouble. At the time, the Euro was 1.37 to 1 US Dollar. The cost of the room was about 150 Euro per night and a 2 night minimum was required. This hotel is situated upstairs from the shop below. When they say \"Dutch staircase\" they mean it. It's a small staircase that ascends straight up; I'm not joking, straight up. So, lugging big bags will take some strength. Once you are inside, the owner and staff are very nice and casual and love to chat you up and tell you where to go. The main office serves as the common room and the breakfast room. This room has a nice view of the downtown area. At the time, there was a lot of construction going on right across the street. My friend and I rented a small room with a double bed and bathroom. The rooms are small and compact. Don't expect to lay out your stuff. The bed is in the center of the room with nightstands on either side. The bathroom is also compact and reminded me of an RV bathroom. There was a peculiar mold smell in our bathroom and a pigeon serenaded us in the hollowed out once-was-a-bathroom-vent space outside. The bed was comfortable and a TV is attached to the wall. There was even American shows and movies on their stations. Overall, our room was clean. The staff came everyday to make the bed and put out a fresh bath towel. Remember this: having towels of any kind in Europe is a luxury, so bring at least a face cloth and a bath towel, because some hotels do not even supply them for you. The hotel was very secure. They had security cameras down the halls and at the Dutch staircase. The room doors had to be unlocked with keys and relocked from the side you were on. The staff also holds your keys when you leave the building, so you don't lose them. On our stay, it was also very quiet. The noises you heard were the dinging of the tram system outside and the passerby people. Breakfast was included in the price of our room. It consisted of two kinds of cereal, breads and jams, hard-boiled eggs, sliced cheese, assortment of sliced hams, tea, coffee, milk, and juice. Light by American standard, but still good. Since this hotel is situated downtown, it's in prime location to everything. The locals walk and ride bikes, but you can get just about anywhere else from the tram. If you are extremely picky, don't stay here, but I'm pretty laid back and I would recommend this hotel to people I know traveling to Amsterdam; and I would personally stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "October 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna", "Title": "\u201cMore a warning than a recommendation ...\u201d", "Author": "Reviewer085", "ReviewID": "UR7852965", "Content": "This was one of the most ugly hotels I have ever been to!

Not the most appealing of sights when you've lugged your bags off trains and trams from Schiphol, and if you have the misfortune of staying on the top floor- as we did- you have twice the climbing pleasure. Yes, buildings in Amsterdam are tall and narrow, blah blah blah, but tourists have suitcases, and the Ajax would do well to recognise that. The rooms themselves are, in a word, horrible. Even with the lowest of expectations, having read some of these reviews beforehand, I was still shocked. Only one of the lights in our room actually worked, and it wasn't the one in the tiny, cramped bathroom either. The rooms have neither air conditioning nor even simple air circulation, meaning that when temperatures were fresh outside, our room still felt like a sauna. This also means that if you like to apply make-up or style your hair in the morning, you may as well not bother; I had to give up and go au naturel for most of our stay. Only one of our three windows, covered with grubby net curtain, opened properly, and when it did, we were treated to the noise of building works on the street outside. The walls were dirty, and both the shower curtain and at least one of the towels provided were riddled with mould. I did bring along my own bathtowel, but this was promptly lifted by room service- presumably by mistake- and never returned. The icing on the cake was the surly night reception girl who made us stand for quarter of an hour one night waiting for our room key without acknowledging our presence while she dealt with an irate customer on the phone. (Evidently his client 'wasn't happy with his room' - no kidding) Suffice to say we didn't sample the all-inclusive breakfast. If this is the only hotel available during your stay then you might want to consider postponing your visit to Amsterdam. Seriously.

The staff I must add was receptive and welcoming but really it ends there. And another factor was the unusually warm weather in Amsterdam when I stayed there (31 C). But the excuses stop there. No elevator so I do not recommend those who cannot walk up steep flights of steps to stay there. The rooms (and I stayed in two) were clean but it seemed like not much was done to make the traveler comfortable (for reference see Jan Vermeer's \"The Milkmaid\" for a visual idea of the room I stayed in, not the one posted on the web site, that must have been one of the suites). No air conditioning or fan for that matter (see technological advances in the 17th century and see if you can find air comfort systems), the view I had the first night was of the tile rooftop and pigeons giving me a wake up call at 5:00 AM. Some paint peeling off the walls (again for reference see Dutch master paintings from the 1600s and observe the walls in the paintings). The other person who was with me had another room and had a view of a narrow alleyway where no one could walk through. The bathroom doubled as a sauna (with no intention to double as one). The shower head had a crack and water spewed in a spray at the shower curtain making water shoot out of the shower a bit. Now for the toilet, as far as I could tell they'll put one anywhere and when I tried to sit my 6'1\" frame on the seat I could not put my legs where they \"should be\" in front of the toilet. For amusement I took clean pictures of that incident. The room and top floor for that matter appeared to have been in the process of falling apart (i.e. sheetrock walls crumbling where I did not see it earlier, the wire housings coming apart from the wall). Breakfast the next morning was fine, typical Dutch. The other room I was expecting more out of but was disappointed, the T.V. in that one didn't work and looked like it was made in the mid 1980s, someone before us who stayed in the room decided to place decals on the door, not very professional and family like, and again no air conditioning, a breeze sometines entered the room, we were in the gabled room and could see the gable hook from out the window. The website mentions a DVD player I did not know who had it, if they had more than one, or if you had to rent it for a fee, but I believe that's false advertising and I entered three rooms and did not see one. All in all, the people were nice but I would not recommend the hotel if you are going to take the wife or husband on a trip or if you are taking children. Definitely not worth the price of 119 Euros for a four person room, for that price in the states you could get a room with air conditioning, elevator, bar service, comfortable bathrooms and a decent view. Now I know why that milkmaid in Vermeer's painting looked so miserable in the room she was in. The hotel would be great for friends who do not look so much for the comforts of a hotel but a place to lay their heads down after going out all nights to the bars. My opinion only.", "Date": "July 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brizzel, Oxon", "Title": "\u201cDeath Trap\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2770420", "Content": "Well located but that is the single advantage of this place.

You can arrive there by tram or walking from Amsterdam Central Station. It won't take so long. Because it is close to the tram stop, you can hear noise made by the tram.
