{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Our Favourite Hotel of our Entire Stay Our second day in Japan we travelled from Nagoya to Tokyo via Shinkansan. The Strings was basically attached to the station. It was a little confusing that reception was on the 26th floor of Shinagawa East Tower, but we managed it none the less. As soon as we stepped off the elevator we were greeted by friendly and helpful reception staff. Checkin was quick and efficient. The lobby of the hotel is spectacular, fantastic modern architecture with a true Japanese feel. The rooms were also amazing, the best rooms we stayed in our entire stay. Everything was modern and of exceptional quality. The hotel had a gym and steam room which were great. The buffet breakfast was great, wide variety. The Guest Experience Manager is a true asset to the hotel, Ben Johnson was very helpful with local sights and attractions. Ben even rang ahead to our next hotel (ANA Intercontinental Tokyo) and ensured Us that the Guest Experience Director there would look after us during our stay. Which he did indeed.Anybody who stays at this hotel is sure to love it...ENJOY this hotel, its expnsive but well worth it...", "Date": "Oct 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR882183413", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Niquei"}, {"Content": "Perfect time - perfect place       Cherry Blossoms", "Date": "Aug 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR154427115", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TraveltheworldDude"}, {"Content": "Check-in Nightmare I've stayed in many I hotels in Asia, this is likely the worse check-in experience I've ever had (luck of the draw I guess). I'd reserved a double single bed, upon arrival, I re-confirmed with the check-in girl if the room was indeed a double single bed. She said 'yes', I got to my room it was a king size. Obvious I was not a happy camper. I called them to change, they didn't apology just ask me to WAIT. The front desk was not informative at all, it took 35 minutes to iron things out and finally get the room I reserved. This is totally an unacceptable standard for any I' hotel.

But I can guarantee that I will be returning to this hotel.The hotel itself is a stones throw away from Shinagawa Station (literally a 1-minute walk under a skywalk). The signs from the train station lead all the way to the hotel entrance. And for those unfamiliar with Tokyo, Shinagawa Station is equidistant from both Shinjuku-Shubuya Stations and Tokyo CBD Station. In other words, Shinagawa is the PERFECT central base-camp if you want to see Tokyo.The hotel staff at the Strings are always switched on, particularly the waiting staff in the two restaurants The Dining and China Shadow. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND OPTING FOR THE BUFFET BREAKFAST. The quality of the food at The Dining is absolutely world class and the buffet breakfast (served between 6:30am - 10:00am) is no exception.I had read previous comments where travelers had felt underdressed in Japanese 5-star hotel foyers and restaurants. At first, I thought they were being silly - but you soon realise that jeans and t-shirts just do NOT cut it in Tokyo. Do yourself a favour and bring a couple of nice dress shirts and a jacket/blazer (for guys) or a nice evening dress (for women). The hotel restaurants are constantly frequented by suited-up Japanese businessmen and by Tokyo's young  socially hip, so you need to fit in with the crowd. So when you dress for dinner, think James Bond coming downstairs for cocktail hour. And the end of the day, you could wear jeans if you really wanted to, and no one would treat you any differently, but trust me - you'll feel like a fish out of water. And besides, its nice to get all dressed up once in a while.TIPS: - There is NO swimming pool, so don't bother bringing your bathers.- In case you get peckish and don't want room service at night, the Dean  DeLuca at Shinagawa Station is open until 11:00pm almost every night and they serve the BEST gourmet salads and pastries. Always good for a nightcap.", "Date": "Apr 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR595851614", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Dorham"}, {"Content": "High Quality Small Hotel Not sure if I've ever stayed in a hotel with a reception on the 26th flor of an office building.

My husband and I decided to book the Strings as our honeymoon hotel. We can honestly say it was fantastic.

We arrived at 10 in the morning but the staff still checked us in even though it was not meant to be until 2pm, as they said they could tell we were tired from our journey. Its a great base to see the city from as you are right by the station and on the Yamanote line.

I've been staying at the Strings for a few years now. When they first opened, the place was amazing. Contemporary elegance without the hype. A refreshing hotel in an otherwise hectic place.Over the years and my many stays though, the quality has started to decrease. The rooms are looking warn (especially the carpet) and more times than not they screw up my room rate. I work for a major Japanese company and the rate is supposed to be the same each time I stay but that never seems to be the case lately.That said, I still give the place 4 stars.. for now. That's because I've had lots of good stays. I'll be back again in June and if things haven't improved, I'll be downgrading them to a 3, not to mention looking for a new hotel in Tokyo.If you're going to stay, I recommend a corner room. Rooms are a bit smaller but have much better views. Great if you've got a date, too. =) Skip the breakfast unless it's included in your room rate. Bar is okay and wine/scotch selection isn't bad but it's certainly not a place to hang out and meet people.

The good: - Modern rooms in contemporary design. - Nice daybed, big windows, bright and spacious rooms- Impressive, lofty lobby and restaurant- Small but nice Gym with view over Shinagawa/Roppongi- Good (roofed) access to Shinagawa and Yamanote-line- Good value for money (especially if you book early enough)- Free minibar in Club Rooms- Stunning view over tokyo bay (in 25% of the rooms)- Very impressive junior suites- Star Alliance miles - Comfortable bed, LCD-TV with free movies, nice bathroom- One of the best breakfasts in Tokyo (priced at 2800 Yen)The bad:- Not so quiet rooms if you are on the Shinagawa side.- No view at all if you are on the south side.- Limited choice in restaurants nearby- Shinagawa is a business area that's dead on weekends- The limousine bus stops a 3 minute walk away from entrance- The limousine bus does not leave as frequently as usual- Not so easy to find if you are visiting for the first time- There are only 2 restaurants inside the hotelAll in all, the Strings is an excellent hotel with only very minor flaws. The atmosphere is great, and the rooms are well appointed. It may not be a perfect 10, but quite close. At rates between 18.000 and 30.000 Yen, you get more than you do at other hotels at this price range. It is fully booked accordingly, so make sure you book early enough. If you can afford it, try the suites and you will not be disappointed. They have corner rooms with nice furniture and the flair of a well furnished, modern and stylish apartment.

The room was very nice, and I slept very well. Great Tokyo location. I would stay here again in a minute. The Fitness Center has a wonderful view of Metro Tokyo.The only faults are when selecting a room, ask reservations for a room on the other side of the train station. You will hear the trains all night. Also, the pillows were a tad uncomfortable. Finally, the two onsite restaurants look very nice but they are expensive.

I'm surprised Strings Hotel isn't further up the Tokyo hotels list. I wanted to book Park Hotel, having stayed there before, but Strings was agood second choice and in the end slightly more enjoyable/more convenient.I stayed here with my s/o for two nights over the weekend. We were in Tokyo specifically to go shopping and found the Strings' position - right near Shinagawa station - to be ideal. Being right on the JR Yamanote line, we could access Harajuku, Ginza, Shinjuku and Akihabara all within 25 minutes. Shinagawa is also on the Narita Express line from the airport, although we preferred the hotel's shuttle bus and airport limousine bus.The rooms were compact but not at all cramped - and seemed spacious and light. The bed was like sleeping in a cloud, the water was hot, there was a cute love seat, a scattering of expensive coffee table books to read, the furnishings calm and zen-like, not sparse or tacky, a cd player with a cd of ambient music - it was all very well thought-out and welcoming. Service was great and we booked through Tablet, so got free breakfast and afternoon tea/lunch every day. Getting food of that standard - 5* restaurant - for free was amazing to us, since the meals were worth about 7000yen.Other hotel patrons included rich japanese people there for shopping, families on holiday, wedding attendees (there were 2 weddings while we were there) and hip young couples (like us, of course).

While the overall design and location are excellent, this hotel was a real disappointment.Our executive room was probably 250 sq. ft. In fact these so-called club rooms and non-club rooms are on the same floors. The only difference might be the view? Non-club rooms are closer to elevators though. There is not a club for guests staying at club rooms. So everybody has breakfast at the same place. To be honest choice of food was very limited.One night after turndown, a cup, teabag and note were left behind. It was thoughtful indeed. The only problem was that there were two guests in the room!We had to take an evening flight back home. Surprisingly our request for a late check-out (2 or 3pm) was declined because their rooms were fully booked. I booked our room less than 36 hours before our arrival and there were still plenty of rooms to choose.Finally when I asked about frequent flyer mileage at checkout, I was told the promotional rate of US$350 per night was not eligible. It would be perfectly OK for them to tell me that only ANA frequent flyers would be able to collect miles since this was a property operated by ANA.

The hotel is connected to the Shinagawa JR station -- so it is very easy to get to the hotel from Narita (Narita Express stops at Shinagawa) -- The Shinkansen JR Lines -- and easy connections throughout Tokyo Via JR. I never had to take one Taxi the entire time -- the station newly updated and is very easy to access. The Hotel is just amazing. Upon arrival from the Train Station -- you take a private elevator up 26 floors to the lobby. The hotel is an open air atrium style (floor 26 and above) and has an amazing gym, business center, and even a stream running through the lobby. The rooms are extremely comfortable with amazing views. Each room has its own LCD TV -- separate shower and bath. The rooms are also equipped with Toto's electronic toilets which just incredible. The staff is beyond friendly and speaks manageable English. The only downside of the hotel is the food prices. You will be looking at close to $30 USD for a chicken sandwich and good luck finding a dinner entree for under $40. The good news is that there are tons of reasonable restaurants in the Shinagawa area and they are all connected via elevated walkways.
