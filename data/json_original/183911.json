{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Okay, but staff kind of rude I am a fairly seasoned traveler. I understand that this is a bare bones hotel and was prepared for it. Bring mosquito netting if you want to keep the windows open, FYI. And do not expect quick maid service if your room is located on certain levels of the floor. I'm not sure what they do each day, but the maids are slow. Also, do not ask for extra towels. This essentially assures you will not get your room cleaned that day!!! Apparently, this is not the maid's fault, but was ordered by the front desk.  The food in the hotel restaurant was okay, but the service was excellent- the waiters really were very nice. The front desk people were another story. You never knew if they would be civil, or incredibly rude. And they smoked like chimneys so that the hotel constantly stunk--this considering the fact that theoretically, there is no smoking in Mexico City. The smoke would frequently drift into my room and make it smell awful: and I'm a SMOKER!!! Go figure.When it came time to check out, the bill was a bit of a mess. Nowhere on it was the total amount tallied up. Not a problem for tourists, but for anyone having to submit receipts for reimbursement, a minor pain considering I'd asked them repeatedly to do this for me in advance. At that point I just wanted to leave. It was not a terrible experience, just not a great one; but it is an inexpensive hotel. Make sure you ask about wireless internet. They have it in the lobby, just not advertised!Oh, and if you're a tourist that doesn't speak Spanish, do not even consider staying here (or in this area for that matter). I would probably not stay here again.", "Date": "Aug 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR420958785", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "michele_sooners1977"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d183911-r19330846-Hotel_Antillas-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "183911", "Price": "$25"}}
