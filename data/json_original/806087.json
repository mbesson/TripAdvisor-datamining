Swift check was excellent. Room 12 (on top floor), which I was assigned, was a nice room although, some minor issues - also, I was advised in e-mail, when originally booking, that this room had a nice view - however, this was not the case. Very noisy at night (due to windows being open, because of the hot weather), also the street being constantly busy (and noisy all night - also, the sirens from the emergency services). I was disappointed however on Saturday afternoon, whereby I had to ask at reception for replacement teabags/milk/sugar, etc - the cleaner had been into the room, and tidied the bed (which didn't need much done, as I had already tidied this), but forgot to replenish these items. Also, the table at the side of the bed was holding \"old\" water below the plastic, which I had to dry with a towel - I am not sure what had happened to this, prior to me having the room. At breakfast yesterday, I did ask for boiled egg and bacon - but only got the boiled egg, so don't know what happened there!

First, the good points: a) The location is fantastic - a short walk from Euston station, very central in London. b) The price is very low for central London (\u00c2\u00a355 p.n. for a single room). c) The staff were excellent - very friendly, helpful and competent, with a very good standard of English. d) I had requested a quieter room when booking, and was given a room at the back of the hotel, which was indeed nice and quiet at night. e) The staff promptly replaced a lightbulb (in the shower cupboard on the top floor) and installed a new roll of toilet paper (in the toilet on the top floor) very soon after being notified about these matters. f) Free wi-fi Internet is available throughout the hotel. Now the less good points: a) The bedrooms were very shabby and not particularly clean (though probably just about adequate), and were rather small. b) The shared toilet on the top floor was in a really tiny cupboard. A large person would probably not be able to use it. (However, there are other shared facilities on other floors, which have much more space). c) There was only one pillow on the bed, and no spare pillow or blanket were provided in the room. The chambermaid provided a second pillow when I requested it, but I found it strange that only one rather thin one was initially provided. d) Although I am able-bodied and had no problems, it should be noted that this is definitely not a hotel for the mobility-impaired: there is no lift, and breakfast is served in the basement. The trek up to the the third (USA: fourth) floor from the basement is a workout in itself. A fellow guest told me that the hotel is in the process of being re-branded to \"The Prince of Gower Hotel\", and indeed the staff were sporting sweatshirts with that name on. Apparently this will include a complete refurbishing of the rooms - so it may well improve in the near future.

The other items of furniture shoe-horned in were a rickety pine wardrobe, 2 chairs and a desk/dressing table. The room was far too cramped for us and our luggage. We found the room to be relatively clean and tidy, given there wasn't a lot of floorspace to mess up, but the ensuite facilities are old and in need of a visit from Kim and Aggy to remove some of the ancient limescale and mould. The shower tray was springy underfoot and was so worn in places that the white enamel had disappeared in parts allowing the black underneath to show through.

From some of the other reviews I thought it might be noisy. I had a street-facing room on the top floor, and from there the traffic sounded very distant (and there wasn't very much of it). What woke me up in the mornings was the sound of birds chirping -- absolutely charming! The walls are thin so if you had noisy neighbors it could be a problem -- but all of my neighbors were quiet and polite (I was the only American there -- the others seemed to be French or Italian, or Brits). The rooms had a hot water heater with tea(hooray!), a telly, and plenty of closet space. Yes, the building is older, but well-kept and clean, and a very typical older London row house (by the time I visited Dickens' house it seemed very familiar!). The staff was very helpful to me, particularly on the first day when I was still fuzzy from my flight. The rooms are small and basic, but who in their right mind is going to go to London to sit in a motel room? The shared bathrooms were close to the rooms. I never had to wait for other people to finish and they were kept so clean I never had a perception that I was sharing them with other people.

Our room didn't have an ensuite so we had to go up two flights of stairs to the toilet and shower. That shower didn't even work though (I gave up after about 5 minutes of trying to get a temperature that wasn't scalding or freezing, and the hose pipe is broken anyway so most of the water dribbles out before reaching the showerhead. Next time I tried the other shower, which was another couple of floors up, and that was slightly better but still terrible and disgusting with the same leaking pipe issue. All the pipes were rusting, the paint is peeling etc. Our room was just big enough for a double bed against the wall and a sink. The bed was terribly squeaky so you couldn't move without waking your partner. The worst part though was that after staying there, I woke up with about 15 \"bites\" all over my body. Had checked the room for mozzies before going to sleep and again in the morning, and slept with the window closed, so our best guess was bed bugs or fleas.

It is a basic budget hotel and in early 2009 cost \u00c2\u00a365 a night for a single room. There didn't appear to be a reception area. Instead you just ring the bell upon arrival and after you're given your room you get a key that opens both the main door into the building which is closed off-hours (from approx. 10.30pm until approx. breakfast time 7.30am) and an indoor hallway door that leads to the rooms. There was a member of staff in the basement on the one occasion I went there off-hours (about 6.30am) so it seems there's always at least one member of staff in the building. (All staff I encountered were friendly). The room itself was very basic. For the price you're not going to get an attractive room in this location. I thought it was a bit cold during the night- it was the middle of winter. The heat came on about 5am and there was usually just enough warm water for washing in the morning - though it sometimes took a while to get that warm water. The room was spacious enough with small colour TV (terrestrial channels), desk, closet, and several lights. Everything was very basic budget quality - the room, bed, shower, bathroom, etc. The main problem with the room was noise from all night traffic on Gower Street, including a bus stop right outside the hotel. I was in a front room so ask for a room facing the back if you're a somewhat light sleeper. There is no lift/elevator but there aren't that many floors and the stairs aren't steep, like in Amsterdam, so it won't be a problem unless you've got mobility issues. Breakfast was served in the basement. You could have bacon & eggs or a poached egg plus cereal, toast, tea and coffee. It was better than most budget hotels I've stayed in. The location is excellent. Gower House is on the same street as the British Museum, close walking distance to many of London's main attractions, and within 10 minutes walk of several Tube stations. There are very few shops on Gower Street itself but nearby (less than 5 minutes walk) Tottenham Court Road has plenty of shops (ie Tesco, Boots, fast food restaurants) and a couple of pubs. Next time I'm in London I'll stay in the same area but Gower House won't be my first choice. That said, it WILL be one of my alternatives if I can't get my first choice.
