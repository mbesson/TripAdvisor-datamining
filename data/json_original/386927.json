This hotels strongest point though is the staff. firstly when we got there, we were very wary as a cab driver had just robbed us of 20 euros whereby we gave him the cash and he very quicky changed a 20 into a 5!! however we went into the hotel(an were 2 hours early for check in), we gave the guy our name and he said that our room may be ready but if not he would get someone to sort it for us straight away- which I thought was really good. all staff on reception had good english and if u had any questions about how to get to places or what buses to catch, they were very very good and even stood there talking you through it on a map. spanish steps are 5 minutes and the other sites arent far either", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio de Janeiro, RJ", "Title": "\u201cVery Good location, but the hotel is old.\u201d", "Author": "Ondina30", "ReviewID": "UR126305504", "Content": "hotel with excellent location with a very tasty breakfast, located on a terrace with a beautiful view as well. however, the hotel needs maintenance. we stayed three days with the air conditioning does not work. complain many times but nothing was done.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aurora, Canada", "Title": "\u201cparking nightmare\u201d", "Author": "Marg T", "ReviewID": "UR125086157", "Content": "Our experience almost 2 years later was more than a disappointment.

Both hotels are in a great location and walking distance to everything. Anyway, the Concordia was the second of the two hotels, being the top side of the Via de Tritone and near to the Spanish steps.

But this was not a pleasant experience. On the first night I realised that the air-con wasn't working. The room temperature was over 24 degrees and it was stuffy. If you know central Rome you'll know that opening a window isn't an option if you want to sleep! Eventually I went downstairs (early hours of the morning). It was explained to me that the Italians didn't think it was hot, and that the air-con wouldn't be turned on until the 15th (a couple of weeks time). After a short discussion (which I had to do in Italian as the person downstairs at that time of morning couldn't speak much English) he decided to turn on the air-conditioning. Sadly he didn't know how, but at least he tried. The next morning the air-conditioning was working and although I had to tell them to turn it on again the next evening, it did stay on for the rest of the stay. The rooms are noisy! Very noisy! You can hear whenever a room nearby turns on it's taps, shower, or flushes a toilet. Don't expect to get too much sleep! The room was clean and nice, the bathroom was okay.

I had forgotten to ask for a double bed in the request form on their site when making the reservation but my husband and I decided to just keep the room without asking for another. it was a very small room but we were already expecting it to be because I know most European hotel rooms aren't large like American chain hotels. although the room was very small, but we managed just fine. there is a closet to hang things and we left our large bag at the foot of the bed. if our bag wasn't so stuffed it would have fit under the bed just to save some room. the lift is teeny tiny but we had the porter bring the bags up for us and we just went up the stairs since it was only one flight. the bathroom is a good size and very very clean. the shower is on the small side, but it was just fine. the service was great.. the hotel staff are very friendly and the breakfast was very nice to have included in the room rate. it is a very simple breakfast, some bread, pastries, cheeses, jams etc... but very good. I brought my own travel iron and just ironed on the small desk in the bedroom. some people might get annoyed having to do this, especially if you have items that you have to spend time ironing with, but for our clothing I managed just fine. I am not sure if they provide iron/ironing boards at the hotel so that is why I brought my own iron. while researching areas to stay in, we had first concentrated around Termini station, but after reading info that there are shady areas there, we decided to go toward the Spanish steps. Hotel Concordia is just a short walk away from the Spanish steps, Piazza del Poppolo, and also the Trevi fountain. we took the double decker bus to the Colosseum, but on new years eve we walked from our hotel to the colloseum, and it isn't that bad of a walk.. it felt good to walk in the cool weather since we come from such a hot country. we went to the Termini station a couple of times and walked around outside and we were very glad we decided to go near the Spanish steps instead... they also give free internet access... but only in the lobby of the hotel.. we tried in our room anyways, and lucky us, the wireless worked in our room :) so that was another plus of being on the first floor. before I go--for the double decker buses... we got the one named \"Panoramic Tours\". the bus itself was nice, but every time we went to a stop to wait for one, we saw a couple other double decker bus at least twice in the time we stood waiting. one is one that has Rome as the name and Ciao Rome.

I read that many hotel's room in Rome have a problem of noises from the street, however the street of the Concordia is a small street and just a few cars were passing by during the night so this was not so bad. In the room we have a mini refrigerator with beverages in extra charge, a safe that is locked with a key, not by a digital combination lock, a small old TV with several channels but only one channel in English that was the CNN.

The front desk staff was exceptional, very kind and considerate. Oh so friendly and professional. They wanted to make sure that we were safe, used the security box for valuables, had an address card before venturing out, knew our location on the map, etc. We felt very well taken care of. We were given a front room (facing street) on the second floor (203). The room was indeed small, but the bath was large, with lots of shelf space. The room and bath were very clean/fresh. On the second floor, not only did we hear ample street noise (is this the street of sirens and car alarms?), but we also had a tap dancer of sorts upstairs. Given that the rooms were small, we didn't know how one person could walk around so much. Luckily, we laughed about it. Also, the walls must be thin, despite the age of the hotel. At night (around 10 p.m.) we heard the t.v. from the room next door (behind/above our heads). I never thought much about a quiet location or room, but I guess I'm getting more persnickety with experience and age (especially when the dollar is weak and thus, I'm spending so much more.) The breakfast in the sunny yellow breakfast room downstairs was fine and dandy, with cappuchino and pastries, some meats and cheeses, yogurt and fruit. Service was very efficient and everything was clean and well presented. (However, this wasn't the best breakfast I've had at a boutique hotel.) Overall, we had a very nice stay, but still I'd go elsewhere next time because I'm interested in exploring more options in Roma. Suggestion: If the other reviews convince you that this is the place for you, ask when booking about a higher floor or a \"back\" room for less street noise.

He is rude, unhelpful and has no customer facing skills. While I was trying to explain to him that there was a problem with the noise in my room due to the work being done on the roof he first lied to me to say that the work was next door and then accused me of being the only person to complain about the noise as no other quest has complained. Of course no other quest was staying on the 4th floor at the time. 2.The roof that is featured on the website is currently undergoing renovations and will not be finished for another few months. So if you are unlucky enough to have a room on the 4th floor you may expect some noise 3.Breakfast is the most measly I had in Italy.

He claimed to have discussed the situation with the owner and I was told they *must* honor the reservation *they* received and not the one I made, despite them absolutely acknowledging that there was an error made. The good news is that their double bed is more like a queen and it wasn\u2019t so different from their twins as their twins are pushed together (almost functioning as a double) anyway. Not much separation while asleep regardless! I was also shocked at how small the rooms were\u2026 all three! When I say \u2018small\u2019 I actually mean not much room to even walk.

It's also fair to say that the breakfast is basic even for Europe - one type of meat and the rest is the usual bread, jam and cheese fare. That said, the staff understand the importance of boiling water fo tea, and that cold milk, not hot, is also important! The other observation - when the postings talk about small rooms, they REALLY mean it. But I have to tell you - all the postings about the friendliness of the staff are absolutely true. In addition, I have never stayed in a room so obsessively clean in my life, and I've stayed in the best hotels in Europe. I have a back injury at present and spent quite some time flat on the floor, so trust me, when I say it's clean I really know. Finally, thank God, it's true, the air conditioning is \"proper\" air conditioning, not a gasping box in the corner like so many Rome hotels. It is preset at 19 degrees, which might be a problem if you like it REALLY cold, but the contrast between 19 degrees and the outside makes it a liveable temperature. Ultimately would we recommend it?

The people at the hotel are great, the rooftop breakfast was beautiful, and the location is fabulous. As well, they didn't charge us for the couple of beer we had from the mini bar, which was a welcome surprise (the clerk said since we paid s much for the room... which was true at $230 Euros per night!). Where my expectations were to high was the room itself - having been in Capri the few nights before in a suite overlooking the ocean, I was somewhat depressed by the typical teenie-weenie hotel room that plague Europe. The room was so small I don't think we could both stand up to leave at the same time. But there was a window that opened and a tiny balcony, of sorts. And they still turned down thebed each night even though I'm sure that must be hard to do given the proximity of the walls to the bed. All in all, it was a pleasant stay. My husband would not recommend the hotel again, but I definitely would. In fact my parents, in their 60's, stayed there last month and loved it. They appreicated the location and friendliness of the staff.

As all Trip Advisor reviews say, I agree this is an exceptionally clean, well positioned and friendly hotel. We flew with Ryanair and were sold tickets for the Terravision coach from the airport to the Termini station. I had thought that there was a station at the airport, but apparently this is not so. It was about a 40 min trip for 8 euros each which was not a bad price. We took a taxi from outside the Termini station, but just make sure you have the address of the hotel. I just said it was near the Spanish Steps, but the driver professed not to know it. We were dropped off at the Piazza Spana and asked about three different shop owners and some policemen and nobody knew. I then went to an exchange shop and it was literally a three minute walk and around the corner. If you want a bath, take your own plug as the only bath is on the fifth floor in the three bedded room which was very comfortable and a reasonable size compared to the doubles. Although there was a bath we were told that due to another couple flooding the place, there was no plug to avoid this happening again. Bubble wrap under the plughole perforated cover did the trick once the water pressure is enough. When you have walked for 8 hours you need a long soak. Weather was 75% rain but was sunny on the morning we visited the Basilica. Although it did rain, and at one stage after a horrendous thunderstorm, hailed like I have never seen anywhere before, it was still relatively warm. Wear layers in March. Advice given to us paid off. Go earlyish in the morning to the Basilica to avoid the crowds and don't go up to the top if you are claustrophobic as it got quite narrow and sloping at times. However, the views are worth it and I fought my fears. Coming down did not seem as bad for some reason. We only ate in one restaurant as it was close, good, and suited us. If you turn left from the hotel and go straight for about 5 minutes you get to a restaurant called Pizza Ciro (I think that was its name). We had three very good meals from pizza to steak (excellent fillet) and all for around \u00a330 including a bottle of chianti and coffees. Ask Tony where it is.

The problems: - We had interrupted, uncomfortable sleeps for our whole stay - there were a number of reasons for this. The walls are very thin and you hear everything around you, above, below, outside. The bed and pillows were so uncomfortable, we both got sore backs and necks. There is no Do Not Disturb sign on the door so we were woken by housekeeping on a couple of occasions.

We had a fabulous time. We stayed at the Hotel Concordia, which is very conveniently located between the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain. It's also quite close to two Metro stops. We were within walking distance of almost all the major sites. We even walked back from the Vatican one evening, which was probably the site furthest away from our hotel. The staff of the Hotel Concorida was very friendly and extremely helpful. My favorite part of the hotel was the breakfast on the rooftop every morning. Our room was very nice and clean. We had our own bathroom and AC. We saw many sites that were incredible. Our favorites included: The Colosseum - we picked up a guided tour outside of the gate. Well worth it for both the information and the ability to skip the long line. St. Peter's & The Vatican Museum - The climb to the top of St. Peter's is well worth the view and the Sistine Chapel was amazing. But just about everything was amazing in the Vatican museum. But be ready for some big crowds in the museum and watch for the Tourist Trap restuarants outside the Vatican. Trevi Fountain - This fountain was on of my favorites, squeezed into its plaza was amazing. Although crowded, it was a relaxing place to sit and relax. The Pantheon - This is truly a mavel of construction, and I really liked the neighorhood around this. A lot of good places to eat or snack. Catacombs - We toured the Catacombs of San Callisto. We took a bus (only about 20 minute ride) from the station near San Giovani. It was fairly easy to get to. Just seeing the catacombs themselves and learning what early Christians went through to worship were both amazing. Roman Forum - This was fun to see and try to imagine what things were like 1800 years ago. Highly recommended to either get a guided tour (if you can find one, we couldn't) or get a highly detailed guidebook fo this area, as we tried to use my Rome guidebook and couldn't figure out what was what. Churches - Just about every church we stepped into was amazing. Some of my favories were St. Paul's (outside the walls), San Giovani, and St. Peter's. But many of the lesser known churches are amazing as well. For the most part, we ate very well. Some of our best bargains for sit-down meals were at wine bars that had tables in the back for eating. There's a lot we missed, so we'll have to go back.

We agree with almost everyone on this site, this is a terrific hotel. Our room was air conditioned, smallish but totally practical and like the rest of the hotel immaculately clean. I cannot understand what the traveller from New Zealand was expecting when he complained about the breakfast amongst other things. On the continent it is normal to have a cold breakfast, especially as they eat quite late the night before. Anyway, the breakfast consisted of croissants, Danish pastries, bread rolls, three kinds of cereal, biscuits, rye bread, cakes, fruit, orange juice, tomato juice, yoghurts, still water, sparkling water and coffee and tea \u2013 and that\u2019s just what I can remember. Again it was served on the immaculate terrace apart from one day when there was a spot of rain in the morning. I\u2019m glad of that because it gave us a chance to eat in the cellar room \u2013 you must see it. We had a wonderful time in Rome and like most other people we walked everywhere and the Concordia couldn\u2019t have been better situated. Five minutes from the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps from where you can get the Metro to the Vatican (Ottaviano) one way and to St Johns (San Giovanni) the other way. The Pantheon and Piazza Navona are 15 minutes walk away. The designer shops of Via Condotti lead off from the Spanish Steps and though we can\u2019t afford to shop in Armani and such, there are lots of other affordable specialist shops and a great many restaurants too \u2013 seek Roberto\u2019s recommendations. Another thing about this area is that it is very safe. There are many government buildings and embassies and there is a constant police presence. If you want a brilliant cup of coffee, carry on down the Via Condotti into the Via Borghese, past the Spanish Embassy, no sign outside but always a Carbinierri with a sub machine gun, past the little book and print market and just after the computer games shop on the left is the Caf\u00e9 Nicosia on the right.

Many... 1) Good location: Via Capo Le Case is between (almost equidistant) the Trevi Fountains and Spanish Steps.

The staff is helpful and friendly and will help you out with information, directions, getting a cab, etc. They even helped me get a decent bottle of Grappa. 3) Decent breakfast. I usually expect a continental breakfast to be a scone and coffee. Their spread, granted not homemade, was rather good. I dont eat too much so I didnt try everything they have. 4) I got it at a good price. I dont know what was the occasion, but I got it for around E 175/night.

The shopping is fantastic,such a selection to suit all tastes.Our 18 Yr old son and twenty yr old daughter had a ball buying at the shops as there is a great selection of shops to suit every pocket.We only needed to get a taxi twice and that was from the Termini Station to our hotel when arrived on the train from the airport and going back to Termini to get the train to the airport.It's so easy to take the train into Termini Station in Rome from the Airport ,10 euro.
