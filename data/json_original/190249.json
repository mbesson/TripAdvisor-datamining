{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good hotel, clean, great location We stayed at the Admiral hotel in Frankfurt for 7 days. The hotel is well located and in walking distance to the famous shopping mile Zeil Strasse. The metro station is just around the corner of the hotel and there are also a lot of restaurants and bars nearby.The hotel is clean and the breakfast is also good.The hotel service ranges between very nice and very bad. It just depends on the person you are dealing with. Some employees of this were very nice and some of them were pretty unfriendly. The room was ok. For 10 \u9227?per stay you can have WiFi in your room which worked pretty well. For 10\u9227?day you can have a parking lot, a not very big one, but at least you don't have to worry where to park your car.", "Date": "Nov 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR185642505", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "globetrottr"}, {"Content": "Good Value and Location Rooms are quite small, but clean and comfortable. The bathroom was taking some getting used to as it was also compact, but the price and location were worth the price and small rooms. The hotel is off a side street from the zoo and was very easy to reach from the airport as the train station is literally steps from the hotel. This was our first trip to Germany and we just looked at signs and followed bahn routes and found the place easily. It's about a 10 minute walk to Zeil street in a safe neighborhood which we walked with our 1 year old. The baby slept in our bed with us, but we intended this anyhow, so it wasn't a problem with ordering a baby bed. The staff were very nice and provided hot water for our baby food runs several times daily and in the evening. Even the cleaning ladies said hi and were chatty and friendly. Were booking again for a few days in December.", "Date": "Nov 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR805101953", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "expatriotmonster"}, {"Content": "Sleepless in Frankfurt We chose to stay in Hotel Admiral because we were traveling with an infant and we wanted to be near the zoo. In that respect it was perfect. However just to warn other travelers with children that this hotel doesn't own a cot!! We had 2 sleepless nights with an excited toddler in our bed. I asked various staff for a cot in case the first lady didn't understand me but they all agreed that there wasn't one in the Hotel. Our room was also quite small and not much room for a toddler to spread out their toys, fine if you don't need to spend much time in your room. In other respects the hotel was good. The staff were very friendly and helpful, one man in particular ran around after me warming milk! They served a nice selection of cold meats, breads and cereal for breakfast. It was also very near cafes and restaurants for lunch and dinner.", "Date": "Aug 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR324149102", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "spannz"}, {"Content": "Excellent 3 star hotel This is a 3 star hotel and it seems only fair to assess it on this basis. I have stayed in Frankfurt many times, although this was my first time at The Admiral. I have stayed at better hotels - and some worse ones - but this one offers a high quality experience and is the best value for money that I have come across.For its class and its price it is excellent value. It is well fitted out in a modern style, all parts of the hotel were clean, the staff were very helpful and spoke good English. The breakfast was served in a pleasant room and although there wasn't a wide variety of food it was quite adequate and fresh. The bedrooms are well decorated, with modern fittings (although not air-conditioned). The beds were very comfortable indeed; single rooms have a large bed; double have two single beds which although you could put together were not guaranteed to stay together!)The bathroom was compact ( roughly 1+ metre by 2) but the fittings were very modern and the shower powerful - with lots of hot water. There were fresh towels every day and both the bedroom and bathroom were cleaned very thoroughly each day.There is no bar or lounge area although it looked as though you could buy some drinks at the Reception.The location is fine. Very close to the entry to the Zoo; several cafes nearby and just a short walk to Zeil the main shopping street. (There is an excellent ice cream shop on the way!)The U-bahn station is just a few yards from the door to the hotel and gives you immediate access to lines 6 and 7. You are also just one stop away from the S-bahn at Konstablewache. (This also gives you very easy access to Terminal 1 at the Airport.)A very pleasant 5 night stay which I would be happy to repeat.", "Date": "Jun 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR594719894", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Olderguy"}, {"Content": "Very nice, quaint. Well worth the money First off, this is not the Ritz, and it doesn't pretend to be the Ritz. It's a nice, slightly above average, hotel. It's just off the beaten path (just across the street from the Frankfurt Zoo). But with the wonderful German mass transit system, it's very easy to get to. The subway stop is less than a block from the airport; from there, it's an easy connection to another train to the airport.The rooms are small, but clean. The blankets are actually comforters...warm in the chilly German November evenings. The bathrooms are very small. It was hard to take a shower...but I managed.A free breakfast was included with the lodging...but it wasn't your typical contenental breakfast of just coffee and donuts. Not only was their an assortment of rolls, shortcakes, juices and coffee (I just remembered...no donuts), their also had several assortments of cold meats and cheeses as well as hard-boiled eggs. We did not leave the breakfast room hungry.For the cost (we spent about $75/night for our room), it was well worth it. Definately a pleasant experience, and if we're in Frankfurt again, we'd stay there again.", "Date": "Nov 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR838522609", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "LadyBeBop"}, {"Content": "Value for money We stayed in the Admiral Hotel in early May for 3 nights. The hotel was located in a very clean, quiet and safe area of Frankfurt. The tram and train stations were only less than 2 minutes away. The zoo was also only across the road. There were a few cafes and restaurants in the area as well. To walk to the centre on Frankfurt only took 10 minutes. The rate included a buffet breakfast each morning that consisted of a selection of cold meat, cheese, bread rolls, yoghurt, fruit, jams, hard boiled eggs, cereal, juices, tea and coffee. The room was very clean and spacious. The room also had a small tv, telephone and small wardrobe. The bathroom was small but was also very clean and soap and shampoo were provided each day. The service was excellent. The staff at the fromt desk spoke very good english and always tried to help as much as they could. We payed \u9227?65 for 2 people for 3 nights which I think is excellent value.
