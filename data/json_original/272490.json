We stayed for 3 nights January 2011. Marconi hotel itself is in a great location only about 10 mins walk from the Colleseum. The room was fairly big and clean but could have done with some general cosmetic work and the view from the window was a wall and someones parking space but then again the location more than made up for it. Tea and coffee making facilities (kettle and fridge) were a nice touch but the mini bar was very expensive, there is a shop less than a minute away from the hotel where water etc is only 30p for 2 litres rather than the 2 euros for 500ml (hotel price). We only stayed bed and breakfast and found the choices available for breakfast very good, cereal, bread, pastries, eggs, sausages, chips!!!!!!! lol fresh honey (you cut it off the honeycomb), fruit, yohurts and juices, coffee, tea etc. The tranfer from the airport was about 100 euros return (i think that the hotel is about 30 km away) and the taxis do appear to have set prices. Sight seeing- Rome is not a very well signposted city but a map was available free of charge from the hotel. As the weather was nice we walked to the Vatican (it took about an hour) but there were lots of things to see along the way. The Trevi fountain and Spanish steps should def not be missed and the street entertainers on a night were fantastic. I would recommend taking a DVD or book to unwind with after a day of sight seeing as although the hotel has sattelite TV with over 300 channels there was only 1 english speaking news channel (CNN i think) and a couple of music channels. A new charge from the government came in last summer and a charge of 2 euros per night per person is payable on check out.", "Date": "January 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Patras, Greece", "Title": "\u201cjust a great choice ...\u201d", "Author": "8sagittarius", "ReviewID": "UR62005209", "Content": "we are a group of 9 people and all of us are of the opinion that this hotel was an absolutely right choice.

The hotel's web site notes that every room has air conditioning and an internet connection. The hotel has NO internet connections in ANY room. The receptionist noted that each room has a phone jack, from which you can \"connect\" to the internet. I do not believe most people consider a phone line as an \"internet connection\". If you do, then disregard my comment. If you don't, then disregard this hotel! Secondly, I never experienced any air conditioning, despite several requests. Finally, about my third inquiry, the reception noted that the air conditioning was controlled centrally and only operated for a few hours. . . I believe he said 3-5 pm, 11:30 pm to 1:30 am, and 6 to 8 am, or something like that. However, even during those hours, there was no cold air coming out of my vents. Fortunately it was not extremely hot outside, but it was uncomfortable. Finally, the reception was simply not polite. Before any problems arose, there was never as much as a smile. That's no big deal, but the people were down-right rude once I complained about the room being very hot and there being no internet connection. Location was decent, and there were no major cleanliness problems, although there was a musty smell (especially in the hallways) and the hotel has an old feel to it.

We booked with Hotel Connect and got 5 nights for \u00a3240.00 (bed and breakfast at Marconi) - absolute bargain. The hotel is about a 2 minute walk from the termini and 20 minute walk from the Colossuem. We hardly ever used the metro as is was so nice to walk everywhere. The Marconi was very clean, and the staff very helpful when we asked any questions. The room was not too small either and the bathrroms looked quite new. It has tea/coffee making facilities, a safe, a hairdryer, TV, radio and a mini fridge which is a great touch - we bought drinks from local stores and stored them to keep cool. the drinks they supply in the mini fridge were about 2 Euro each - which actually is not bad considering prices in Rome generally! The air-con worked and there was plenty of wardrobe/drawer space for clothes etc. Beds perfectly comfy and we never had any problems with noise from other guests or outside. Also they supply great maps of Rome for free in reception- better than any of the ones the guide books we bought had.
