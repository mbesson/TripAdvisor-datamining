As to food, if you discount the vending machine in the bar which never opens, I suppose that a chocolate bar is the same anywhere in the world - the \"sweet and salty\" food at breakfast (bad translation from the Spanish \"salado\" in some of the reviews by somebody claiming to be British and Australian - I suggest that Tripadvisor check who really wrote those reviews) there is no food available - we all ended up buying doughnuts from a corner shop. All in all, if you want to actually stay in a Hotel where sleep is possible and where they are even interested in knowing what the word \"service\" means, go somewhere else.

First the good news - the rooms seem to have been renovated fairly recently (probably last few years), although there are the occasional defects (mould on seal around bath, etc.) and it faces the Royal palace, so a great position for tourism. Now the bad - I stayed here with a group of work colleagues - all of those who had rooms on the back of the hotel slept like a log - without exception, those of us on the front of the Hotel got a maximum of 2-3 hours' sleep. The basic problem is that the Principe Pio sits right on top of a major road, so when the traffic is moving, there is a wall of noise which hits every room on the front of the hotel, no matter which floor you are on (two of us were on the 5th. Floor) - the only time that sleep is possible is when the traffic dies down (between around 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. - after 5 there is an odd effect - there is a rush of traffic, then silence for a few minutes, then another rush of traffic - basically the silence is when the traffic-lights are on red ! It is clear that attempts have been made to rectify this problem - the windows have some of the biggest double-glazing units that I have ever seen, which originally must have had metal shutters in the middle of the two panes, presumably to cut down on light and noise - those shutters have since been removed and all that the large gap between the panes seems to do is to amplify the noise. The hotel could, of course, fit heavy, thick curtains to try to reduce the noise, but the curtains they have are some of the thinnest that I have seen. We did, of course, try to change rooms, but not surprisingly, all of the rooms at the back of the Hotel were taken for the whole of our stay - when telling us this, the receptionist had the strangest of wide smiles !!! We had planned to use this Hotel as the standard base for our regular visitors to our Madrid Head Office - instead, it will be placed on the growing black-list of hotels never to be used under any circumstances.

The Easyjet flights from Bristol were straightforward and we found our way to the Principe Pio hotel by using the Metro. Madrid's Metro system is extremely efficient and easy to use. Single journeys to any place in the city cost 1 euro but to get to and from the airport costs 2 euros. The hotel is within a reasonable walking distance of the city and all it has to offer if you are wanting to explore on the way. There is a Haagen Das shop en route which we rarely passed without tasting something!! My husband says that he would have preferred to be more centrally placed if we went again for a future visit and we enjoy walking. The hotel room was comfortable with an excellent en-suite which included a bidet. The shower was excellent and there was always plenty of hot water. Tap water was cold and safe to drink and tasted like ours at home. We took a travel kettle and a supply of teabags and coffee which we were really glad to have. There is no fridge in the room but all milk is processed so our container lasted well throughout our stay. My great disappointment was due to the one pillow we were each provided with; they were hard and uncomfortable. I decided to purchase a pillow and found one shop that sold them but at an ehorbitant price! I noticed that the Spanish in this region only have hard pillows and I couldnt find a feather pillow or cushion. The double bed was also of an inferior quality but not too bad for our short stay. The hotel had at least 5 floors accessed by very efficient lifts and our room looked out onto the central area at the back so the nights were very quiet. It is true that the walls are fairly thin and we were kept awake by some noisy Spanish youngsters at times. The Spanish are very loud talkers - be warned!! Our towels were changed even though this was unnecessary. The only other thing I would say to would-be travellers is that English is not very widely understood in Madrid. We took a phrase book and managed reasonably well but I am sure we missed a lot by not speaking any Spanish. We came home dying for fresh salads and our own cooking after eating in little cafes and restaurants. The diet in these was mainly sweet : breakfast was thick hot chocolate and cold 'churros' (doughnuts) that you dunk. There are always french bread rolls with cheese or meat in them.

The inside is much nicer, however, and everything conforms to my expectations of minimum standards. There staff were helpful in giving directions and restaurant recommendations, and making wake-up calls on time (not a machine). There is ample space in the lobby, with a large area for meeting clients or socializing. The hotel has two lifts, the second being rather small. My room, on the fifth floor, had two single beds, a small desk, closet with safe large enough for a laptop, and a view toward the royal palace. There was ample lighting, all controlled by wall switches. (Thank you for not making me try to find the switch on all of the lights and lamps!) The carpeting and furnishings show a bit of use, but the room was quite clean. The only downside to the room itself was the bright blue light emanating from the front panel of the TV. It made the room rather bright at night, and some people may choose to unplug the power. The bathroom was a good size, with full bath (half-sized shower panel kept most of the water in the tub). The soap and shampoo were of good quality and the towels were of high quality. Daily room service was quite good. The included breakfasts featured plenty of options--meets, cheeses, fruit, breads, yogurt, juice, coffee, and tea. No complaints here. I did not try the hotel restaurant (closed Mondays). The main problem that affected me was the quality of the in-room wireless. Kudos to the hotel for having a router on every floor, but the service was spotty and under repair for several days during my stay. Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the Principe Pio. For my standards, anything less would have been unacceptable.

Or you can walk down the hill to the Principe Pio Metro and upon your return get off at The Plaza for the short walk down the hill to the hotel. We (4) utilized a Taxi to get around most often to the sights. It cost about the same (4 - 9 E) as the Metro. The Metro is not confusing to use. The Metro map is very very easy to read. It just takes time to get your barrings. We took 3 day trips outside of Madrid and utliized the Renfe rail service. Again, easy to use. The hotel itself was very clean, the staff accomodating, the rooms large, the bath large (compared to many hotels) and plenty of food with a large variety of items for breakfast. The lobby is very large, two elevators, a downstairs breakfast and banquet room. There is a bar area between the lobby and first floor.

Its a slightly dated hotel in terms of the decor, BUT, you cant fault the location. Its about a 5-7 minute walk to the station (there are 2 stations within walking distance), the Royal palace is near by. If you dont mind walking you could very well walk to many of the other areas from the hotel, (Sol, good for bars and resturants, Plaza de Mayor, to mention a few). If you can get a room at the front of the hotel you'll have amazing views of the Royal palace.If you end up with a room t the back of the hotel its alot less ... glamouous. The Bernab\u00e9u (Real Madrids stadium) is definately worth a vist, you'll need to go by train, but its so easy to use their underground system (the last station on any line tells you direction of travel, and its fairly cheap, 1 euro for a single trip to anywhere in the main areas). I wouldnt recommend a tourist travel card it works out expensive. Also, If you dont mind discovering Madrid yourself you'll find loads to see,especially if you walk (but take good walking shoes)) and in my opinion you wont really need to go on the bus tour guide. Really the only advantage of this is that you find out the history of the places you see but you could get a travel guide book which would do the same thing.

Although, if you do prefer the tube, it's in between two stations so allow 5 minutes walk, at least, to either of them. The surounding area is not particularly great (8 lane carriage way, very busy all the time although barely audible from the rooms) but not particularly bad if you like to go out at night. The approach to the hotel is not particularly nice either. saying that, there are some nice little cafes a few yards away if you fancy breakfast or a coffee. The parking is nearby and for Madrid is a reasonable rate per day if you are staying in the hotel. The staff are very nice and very polite, they really make you feel welcome. We stayed in the 3rd floor. The room was very old in every possible way, from the carpets to the wall paper but not in a glamorous way. There were signs of old wet patches on some parts of the walls and ceiling. Two beds seems to be the standard rather than a double. The bathroom was newish and clean but the shower handle was broken and it took a few attempts to get the water running into the shower rather than all over the back wall. Sadly, on the second day we were there, we got some guests staying in the room above us who decided to have a shower at the same time as me. Somehow, their shower/bath water was comming in like a water fall over my head thought the grid in the ceiling and what an unpleasant experience to get somebody's shower waste all over your head, bathroom and the corridor. I'm not sure where the water came from but I have convince myself it was the shower or sink rather than the toilet! We were leaving that morning so we reported the problem but don't know if they fixed it or somebody else got a \"niagara\" experience also.
