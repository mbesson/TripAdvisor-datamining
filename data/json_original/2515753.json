My friend and I were there for 3 nights, 2 queen beds. No bugs. Room was cleaned nicely each day. On the downside, it can be noisy when people are coming/going, there's only one person in the office at any time, and you need to go to the office to retrieve anything extra you might need, like towels. It took 30 minutes to check out because there were 2 people ahead of us and only 1 employee. You get the usual tiny soaps, so we were glad we brought our own. The coffee tray in the vanity area was refilled every day, and the pot cleaned. Yes, it's near the \"adult\" entertainment section, but there are many hotels in this area. It's a popular area due to the proximity to the bay. The wifi was up and down. Inconsistent. Saw people in the pool, but we didn't use the pool. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but I wouldn't stay to avoid it either. If you're on a budget, this place is okay.

We just got back from staying here and I was very wary of the place based on previous reviews. Really, it is not that bad. No, it's not a 5-star hotel but what do you expect for the price? There is a lobby where you check-in during normal hours - the glass window is for late check-ins which is pretty standard at a cheaper hotel. Our room was clean and had the added bonus of a fridge. The breakfast was a variety of pastries which were ok. If you're travelling with a dog you can't beat the location as it is sooo close to Fiesta Island (amazing off leash dog park) and just across the street from Camp-Run-A-Mutt for doggy day care (if, like us, you don't want to leave your dog in your room all day while you do things without them). The only thing is it is hard to find information on their pet policy online which makes it seem like they don't charge for pets - they do, it is $15 per day. The location is not at all sketchy, I saw one review where the person complained about the number of RV's parked on the street. That's because there's an RV service garage just around the corner from the hotel! I did not observe any drug related behavior from anyone in the neighborhood - the hotel is right next to an 'active seniors' condo complex! I felt pretty safe while staying there and I am 6 months pregnant so do take extra precautions.

Rooms were fine but sheets were a little dirty ... No internet access available but a little complementary breakfast (coffee,tea and some bakeries) is provided. There is also a pool but we didn't try it. A large free-parking was also available.

Heritage Inn San Diego The place can be good or bad depending on what you are looking for. Although the hotel itself is okay...its the area that surrounds it that makes it....eerie. Right across the hotel..there is a grassy area...near dennys..and well..lots of bums in the street and weird people talking to themselves hang out there. But in the 4 nights i stayed in the area...and DO take note that i walk to and from the area Every night ALONE around 11pm....nothings happened to me. Its just really creepy when you have to pass by a bum in the street whos talking to himself. Looking at the hotel itself...its pretty clean..no complaints...Staff are VERY nice and helpful. Area is superrrrrrrr great! near the beach...near bus stops....and not too far from gaslamp quarter which was hella fun. And it is VERY affordable. I kinda feel sorry for this hotel actuallly...because the hotel itself is not bad..and the location is good too. But its the area surrounding it that makes it creepy. Rest assured though..the cops are DEFINITLY on watch. i saw the police come by the hotel TWICE! One guy was caught getting a hooker. Tips if u decide to stay: 1. Get a room that is on the lower floor..Because the elevator is CRAP! it smells like pi$s...the lights flicker..and its superr slow. (think horror movie elevator scene) 2. If u want to avoid the creepy surroundings..just mjake sure u have a car. Theres no where really to hang out at night anyway in that area. 3. Its cheap..so dont expect 5 star cleanliness. There was NOTHING dirty about my room...but obviously it doesnt have that spark nice hotels has. 4. IF you are truly on a budget..go for it. But the holidayy inn express right beside it doesnt look so bad either. Have fun! SD is my favorite place in the states!", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kettering, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood Budget choice\u201d", "Author": "Ellis40", "ReviewID": "UR19114213", "Content": "For San Diego this Motel gives you good value for money. Its clean, the rooms have fridges, it provides a little breakfast (if it hasn't run out!) and is convenient for Sea World (5 minutes drive away) and the Interstate (just off I8). It also has a reasonable sized pool. The area has quite a few restaurants nearby. The only downside wasa very stroppy man who checked us in. Even though it said 3pm check in and we were there at 3.10pm he got stroppy with everyone in the line and just said he was not checking anyone in until 4pm. I think he was a little stressed as he had been let down by the cleaning staff and others who worked there, however he shouldn't have taken it out on us! We had just had a long drive from Palm Springs. When we returned at just after 4 he was very cheerful pleasant and polite so I guess something really had upset him earlier", "Date": "August 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood Location with a good price\u201d", "Author": "canada75", "ReviewID": "UR12416966", "Content": "Booked this hotel because it has a good location and was one of the cheapest rates I found in all San Diego. I was using public transit while in town and the Premier was just off a bus route with frequent service throughout the day ( route 8/9 get off at the Red Lobster past the Sports Arena) This made it easy to get to Mission Beach, Lo Jolla, Sea World, Old Town and Downtown or even Tijuana on the Trolley from the nearby Old Town Station. Many fast food options and supermarkets nearby. The hotel itself is nothing special, smallish room, spartan appearance, only two small pillows on the bed - but nothing to complain about for the price. The only thing I did find annoying was that when a neighbor's door slammed shut it shook my room too. For the budget traveler looking for a basic place to stay I would recommend the Premier Inn Sports Arena.

After staying here for 3 nights with my 21-year-old daughter, we both agreed we'd prefer staying here again over the Hotel Circle facility stayed at 3 months ago (which was slightly higher in price). Depending on what you're looking for in a room, the price cannot be beat for what you get (comparing it with San Diego's high prices) -- a clean, comfortable bed (pillow-top in the upgraded rooms); clean room; manicured lawn; and a central location with quick access to/from I-8. Be aware, however, that small amenities are not provided in room -- coffee pot, hair dryer, or iron/ironing board -- so either bring what you can from home or borrow from the office. Noise level (next door neighbor's t.v. or maid's cart wheeling by on sidewalk) was dealt with by turning on the heat/air conditioner unit, which runs constantly while on ... a benefit! ... (versus the \"on-and-off, on-and off\" type of unit which can disturb your sleep). We'll definitely consider staying here again on a return trip. I chose to rate it \"above average\" WHEN COMPARING IT WITH other hotels at the same price ... due to the PLUS factors (comfortable bed; clean room; central location). It's otherwise just an average motel ... nothing fancy. If you're looking for atmosphere, check elsewhere and pay the price! I'll spend the money saved on healthy, delicious food!", "Date": "January 10, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Heritage Inn - Sea World San Diego", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d226601-Reviews-Heritage_Inn_Sea_World_San_Diego-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$56 - $103*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3333 Channel Way</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92110</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515753", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3a/81/3a81bf366d0a16ec9f990abd427de4894large.jpg"}}
