The hotel and room was very clean and comfortable. The cleaners did a brill job tidying the room, each day was as if it was the first day we'd arrived. Nice bathroom with good sized and quality shower. Staff friendly and helpful. The breakfast had a great range - cereal, toast, cake, coissant, fruit, yoghurt. No kettle in the room, but a vending machine in recpetion which sold drinks including water and some snacks at a very reasonable price to set you up for a days sightseeing. Also computer and printer available to use in reception. The location of this hotel was brilliant for our sightseeing. It is located near to the end of Diagonal, you can see the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya from the hotel. The best thing is it is 5mins walk from the metro station Glories. We found travelling around Barcelona so easy on the metro. A T10 ticket suited us, you have 10 rides (one ride includes changes so until you resurface) and it cost under 10euros, so this is less than 1euro per ride. So cheap to get around and its quick and easy to do! The hotel is in a fab situation for visiting up (Sagrada Familia and Parc Guell) across (Casa Mila and Casa Batllo, La Rambla) down (beach). If you want to stay out of the hussle and bussle of La Rambla, the hotel felt like it was in a calm and safe neighbourhood.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riga, Latvia", "Title": "\u201cgood value for money\u201d", "Author": "Evijaab", "ReviewID": "UR123266651", "Content": "Was in Barcelona between Christmas and New Year 2009.

The cost per night was actually pretty high, it averaged at about $225/nt. which I think is way too expensive for the quality and location. The hotel is a bit far from all the main attractions, city center, and the metro is about a 5-7 minute unpleasant walk. It is directly adjacent to the theatre so I thought that there would be at least some nightlife or activity around. But there is nothing nearby, not much restaurants, and the markets nearby seem to open at will. I guess that is why they provide free breakfast at the hotel. They also provide free wifi, but it expires every 24 hrs of use, so we had to ask the front desk every night for the new password. The hotel is a new remodel, so there is not a lot of wear and tear. However they cheaped out on the building material. The walls are paper thin and you can hear the adjacent room clearly. The passthrough door between rooms are also not the most secure. The locks are flimsy and the doors are low quality and they seem like you could very easiiy kick through them. The rooms are pretty spacious for Europe. The bed was very uncomfortable and I could feel every spring in the mattress. The mattress was thin and there is no box spring. It felt like I was sleeping on someone's foldout sofabed. All the furniture and accessories came from ikea. There is a glass writing desk near the window with a desk chair. As a small functional desk, it served its purpose, but be careful of those sharp chipped edges, kinda dangerous for the careless. There is a fold out plastic chair in the closet if you wish to put out another chair. There are no safes in the rooms which is a little annoying because who in their right mind would carry their valuables with them in Barcelona? So we decided to opt out of room cleaning for the 4 nights so that the maid won't come in and rummage through our things. Overall, I think the location was a bad choice. I would advise others to spend a little more money and stay closer to the city center, dining out was always a hassle.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aalborg, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cNice place in OK location\u201d", "Author": "nicomorix", "ReviewID": "UR119848321", "Content": "The hotel was in a quite good location, not very central, but not too far (but not too close) to 2 metro stations and at a walking distance (15 mins) from Sagrada Familia.

We chose it to because it is a block away from our friend's flat. Most likely you 'll need to take a taxi or bus here and there, for a short drive. It is an older building totally remodeled as a new minimalist , modern hotel. However I agree with a former report that the mattress should be changed, not terrible, but could be better. The rooms are a little crazy, ours and most of them are the same, had a very nice modern, big bathroom, but the sleeping area was enough only to put the twin beds in it, the TV Screen had to be hanging from the wall. The floors are nice: floating parquet, the bed covers are white and it gives a good feeling of cleanses. HOwever I noticed that the maids, not Spanish born did not clean as good as most Spanish women do. A notch behind.It seems to me that the housekeeping fails by not checking enough. The bathroom and sleeping area are glued together by corridors, which makes the whole \"room\"a little unusual. The breakfast was nice, and they have a nice touch, no matter at what time you leave they manage to give you a juice, a coffee and a croissant or brioche . Very nice. This hotel belongs to the SM Hotels and follows the policy of changing constantly the rates for each single day, so I found myself with a reservation with higher rates than the one offered two weeks later. I cancelled and reserved again, but it left a bitter taste.

How I wish I had paid more attention to the others! While the location is convenient (i.e. within a few blocks) of several Metro stops and a couple major attractions like the theatre and the Monumental bullfight arena, it is in the middle of a short block and over a mile from Las Ramblas and quite a distance from Sagrada Familiia. The rooms are tiny and odd-shaped, and the flat panel tv is 6 feet up on the wall and all of 19\" on the diagonal. That's right, just slightly bigger than your laptop. That's ok though, because the 2 feet or so of space beside the pushed together twin beds will have you screaming if you are claustrophobic, and shaking your head if you are not. Look at the pictures closely, because what they show you is all there is to show. Sleep on the 5th floor was generally good except for when the band practiced in the building next door, or when school was in session (also next door). The bathroom was \"different\" with a sliding glass door but ok; there was no tub and the shower closed via two sliding glass doors that formed one corner. Housekeeping was decent but stingy with soap and toilet paper. The breakfast is continental and basic, consisting of croissants and a few other loaf type breads, fruit, yogurt, juice and milk. The coffee, a decently flavored espresso sort of brew, is brought out individually like it is rationed. There were also slices of one ham-type deli meat and one cheese , and 3 kinds of bulk cereal (not individually packaged). All for 9 Euros ($11) per person per day. And if you think the breadfast is included with your stay as we did, you had better ask up front so you won't be surprised with the bill at checkout, as we were, when the reservation did not match what we had been told our package included. Most of the staff tried to be helpful, but they are not truly multi-lingual and struggle to understand and answer even basic questions. One day-time staffer was downright rude. The hotel does not cash traveler's checks, the \"safe deposit\" is the room behind the front desk, and the internet access is a single computer by the front desk. As in, two steps from the front desk, where they can keep an eye on what you are doing. This hotel is S-M-A-L-L. Lobby furniture consists of 2 loveseats and a chair. I also did not like them calling across the lobby to ask our room number as we were leaving the building, sometimes while other clients were lounging or being helped by the desk staff - it's generally not a good idea to advertise that you're not in your room. I wish I could give you an alternative hotel in Barcelona, but we traveled to Valencia and stayed at the spectacular Westin there.

The hotel looks new (has either been completely refurbished a year prior to our arrival or it was brand new), the rooms are nice, very clean, with new bedroom and bathroom appliances. Because of its location on a quiet street (Calle Ribes), we were able to get rested very well, which was one of our most important aspects in selecting it in the first place. The rooms located towards the front side of the building seem to be the more quieter. According to the web site, the BW Del Teatre Auditory hotel is located in the Eixample area, close to \u201cBarcelona Nord\u201d Bus Station (Girona Airport Bus Stop). For us that was a perfect location, which is close enough to the Sagrada Familia Cathedral, the Ramblas and to the public transportation system, as well as to other points of interest, including the Teatre Auditori (right behind the hotel). There is a bus station on its street (c. Ribes) and the Glories Subway station is only 5-7 minutes away walking, which also makes the hotel very easily reachable from the airport without taking the taxi (by train to Clot, then back one stop to Glories, by subway). Walking to city center (Placa Catalunya/ La Rambla) takes 30-40 minutes (or 3-4 metro stops away from Glories), and half that time to the Sagrada Familia. If one has the Barcelona card, which gives unlimited access to the public transportation system, it would take less than 20 minutes to reach the city center. The subway is running 24h/24h on weekends. The special room price available on BestWestern.com was very good at \u20ac59/night which included a buffet breakfast for two (normally 9\u20ac/pers), great for saving time in the morning, since we would have otherwise spent approximately 15-20 minutes to reach an outside restaurant from the hotel. The food was good and included a large enough selection of choices (several types of cereal and yogurt, milk, various fruit juices, fruits, hams, croissants, cheeses, jams, honey, coffee and tea, bread/toast etc.). The rooms are medium size, with comfortable, clean beds, LCD TVs, A/C, a closet and large windows that could be opened for fresh air. The bathroom was very clean, modern and stuffed with everything normally needed. There is a computer connected to high-speed internet in the lobby, free to use for all guests. There is no safe in the room, but one could leave valuables sealed in an envelope and locked in the main safe at the office, which is guaranteed and worked for us. Last, but not at all the least, we were pleasantly surprised with the friendliness of all the staff during our entire stay. They were very nice, eager to help and accommodated all our requests (thank you!). We received from them valuable information about the city, country and its culture as well as information on restaurants, site seeing, transportation, cultural events, tips. They eagerly helped with our special meal requests and on the day of arrival we received a room with a double bed at no extra charge. Overall, we consider that the Best Western Del Teatre Auditory hotel and its staff fully deserved an 'excellent' rating for a 3-4 star hotel.
