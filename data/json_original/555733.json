While the room was quite spacy and well-decorated, it took me a couple of minutes to work out how to turn the lights on (it was evening - no lighting in the corridor - and had to find an invisible card slot to turn on the room lights) and even longer to work out how to turn them all off when I went to sleep. It would have been nice if the staff had helped with this (they were not particularly busy). The mattress was as hard as wood and the pillows made of lumpy synthetic material. I ate breakfast in the hotel, including what was meant to have been a hard-boiled egg, but was actually soft-boiled. I didn't have lunch, but had a light dinner in the hotel that evening. I was suffering with severe gastric problems for almost a week afterwards. I've no evidence that this was the cause of the problem, but it was the only food I ate and I only drank sealed mineral water, so I think it's reasonable for me to query whether there is a causal link (hence the question mark in the title). The Italian restaurant food wasn't great. The final insult was an attempt to extort \u00e2\u201a\u00ac40 for a short journey that actually cost under TL20.

We were totally amazed by the size of the rooms. For the price, the room quality is absolutely brilliant. The rooms in itself are done up really well and even though the hotel is 5 years old, it feels like it has been constructed just yesterday. The staff is extremely helpful and the they will get you whatever you need. Now, we had 4 rooms, thats why I am able to say this - amongst all the rooms, I liked 310 the best. It has some huge windows and has a good view of the Bosphorous as well. I can imagine that 410 will be even better. The other rooms, i,e. 101, 201, 301, etc. are street facing and I particularly felt a little weird even though the size of the room is really good. But then again thats a personal choice. If I had to stay there again, I would choose either 310 or 410 to stay in. 510 is the penthouse suite, which has the most stunning view, but I found it to be really expensive. Apart from this, one thing that needs to be borne in mind for this hotel is that their toilets wont impress you as much as the room. Now, don't get me wrong - they are really good, but out of the 4 rooms that we had, 2 bathrooms had major problems in them. One of them was really stinking - i think it was room 101 and one of them - 501 - had a clogged drain. I guess the hotel has every other staff, but a plumber is desperately required. Make sure that you choose a room which has no problems in the toilet. Personally, a good bathroom is really important to enhance the staying experience and the Bathrooms didn't really impress me. But i guess, the room makes up for it. Just make sure that there are no major problems in the bathroom before you check into the room. As far as the location goes, you couldn't get any better. The hotel is located just off Istiklal - which is the liveliest street in istanbul. Even then the hotel has some really peaceful surroundings. It has easy access to Tunel station from where you can get connecting trains and trams to all across Istanbul. The location could not get better for a tourist.

The bathroom was spacious, with amenities, bathrobes, and luxurious towels. A very wide person could have a problem in the stand-up shower compartment. Water pressure was strong. The kitchenette was equipped for two people and had a fully stocked mini-bar/refrigerator and a dishwasher. The free WiFi had a strong signal. The included breakfast downstairs was a real sit-down breakfast: omelettes, cold platter, bread, coffee, juice. The owner was charming and gracious and the small staff friendly and extremely attentive. They all couldn't have been better. The restaurant downstairs is excellent. There is a small Dia supermarket about a half block away. The only minor negatives I can think of are that there are no blackout curtains (it still gets dark enough), that the rooms tend to be a little underlit, and that the door could have a more substantial lock (not a big concern).

Internet connectivity was free but a little spotty, especially at night. The location is not all that bad across the Golden Horn near the Galata Tower. A problem did come up when I went to pay my bill. Because I had already had a few scam issues come up in Istanbul I was a little gun shy, I was kind of worried about the bill. I booked for a room at one rate for three nights which meant I would get a 10% discount, as clearly advertised on the web site and through e-mail correspondence. When I arrived I was upgraded to a better quality room because the room I booked was not available but it was clear I would pay the same price as my original room rate. It was great to get a better room with a better view for my original rate. It seemed like it was a forced upgrade, but in any event it was nice to get the upgrade. When I went to pay my bill I was told that the 10% discount only applied if I was paying in cash. I know this scam because it had already been tried on me twice in restaurants, i.e., can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take your credit card because the purchase price is to small (actually the game/scam is to act like your credit card doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work on those neat little \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcat your table\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 credit card processing scanners). The gentlemen at Ansen kept telling me that I got such a great deal with my upgrade that the full price was really fair, which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anything to do with paying cash. After going around and around for a while Ansen 130 Suites won out and I paid the full price with a credit card and no discount. Another Istanbul lesson learned. Count on some sort of scam for just about everything.

We've found so much helpful information on this site before we went that we want to pay back by posting our experience. LOCATION: Great. It is within walking distance to Istiklal Caddesi and many busy restaurants. STAFF: Very friendly. They always try hard to get what you need. However, they do not speak any English. I communicated by writing the words down on paper, and they looked them up on the online dictionary. ROOM: Sleek decor but a bit clostrophobic. We stayed in the Executive Suite on the top floor. The fixtures throughout are very modern and of high quality in general. The room has 3 small round windows and 2 skylights. The square footage is great, but we felt there was not light and air coming in. When we notified the staff that one of the skylights' blind could not be open and the light bulb in the kitchenette went out, they could not get anyone to fix them. The elevator is very tight as well. RESTAURANT: Fresh ingredients and tasty. Breakfast is complementary. We really liked the foods. We wish we could have had more than 1 dinner there. Of note, we tried the Thai restaurant next door (because we had had Turkish foods x 10 days before that). We were the only 2 customers for the entire night. The meal cost $90 USD without alcohol. You can get the same food in California for $20. We would not recommend them. TAXI: Easy to get. The staff can call the taxi center which is 2 minutes away, across from the Petra hotel, and a taxi will show up in front of the hotel within 5 minutes. If possible, get a taxi that works at a hotel. They use the meter and state the hotel name on their business cards. It seems that there is a process they must pass before they can work in front of the hotel. If you take a taxi at one of the touristy sites such as Grand Bazaar or Blue Mosque, expect they jack up the price or not use the meter.", "Date": "July 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, friendly staff and excellent location!\u201d", "Author": "RobbieDubai", "ReviewID": "UR17015227", "Content": "We stayed at the Ansen Suites for 2 nights and had no complaints whatsoever.

The decor is very nice with some modern and vintage art displayed in the reception. The staff were very helpful and gave us honest reccommendations on restaurants to visit which were excellent. The location is also excellent and right opposite the hotel is a cobbled street full of nice cafes and restaurants. It is also a 5 min walk to Istikal Caddesi - the main shopping street of Istanbul.

We were impressed by the place and had a great stay there. (We negotiate a pretty decent rate too so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t settle for the list price unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in peak season.) First off Istanbul is a dirty, polluted place. The food is plain (and mostly bad) and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get a better kebab in Islington than even the best rated ocakbasi we went to (Timeout and HG2 recommended). The people you are most likely to meet are dodgy \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwheeler dealer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sorts (although not threatening) and you have a good chance of being palmed off with counterfeit notes! I have always wanted to go to Istanbul but frankly places like Rome, Madrid, Venice, Prague etc. had somewhat more appeal for me personally. I can say that whilst I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rush back, it is worth braving the negatives for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is if you have an interest in the history and want a break with more to it than caffeine laced art galleries. The Ansen Suites is a good boutique hotel for the money, by any city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standards. We stayed in 2 rooms, being upgraded on our last night to the penthouse. Both were facing the ancient city, looking out over the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGolden Horn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (the channel of water dividing the European side of the city) to the Blue Mosque which made for great views. The Penthouse was identical to the first room we had except it had uninterrupted panoramic views and a small terrace. In all other respects the rooms were identical. D\u00c3\u00a9cor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c modern and stylish; facilities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c broadband, satellite, hotel bar etc; bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shower (no baths) but very modern and with designer soaps etc.. The staff were friendly and helpful (and even (genuinely!) invited us to a very lively private party they had one night). Situation is pretty good, near the main shopping street and close by to quite a few of the best rated restaurants (although as I mention good food is hard to come by in Istanbul). It's a short (<5min) and hairy taxi ride from the blue mosque and the main sites. If you want to brave the pollution, dodgy dealers and pitiful tucker of Istanbul definitely stay here!", "Date": "May 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hartford, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cSerene oasis with great space, food and service\u201d", "Author": "jeanspot", "ReviewID": "UR4468296", "Content": "The Ansen Suites is a respite in a busy but exciting Istanbul.

Our rooms were really large suites with full kitchen, sitting areas, beautiful furniture and well appointed bathrooms. Impeccably clean. Large space. The views are not terrific because the area of the city is being rehabbed, but that didn't matter to us. The value was tremendous considering the cost of regular rooms in even higher star hotels. Great beds, fresh linens, amenities. Staff English is mixed but we got our points across. Either room service or dinner in the charming restaurant or bar was excellent. Deliciously prepared foods with large portions. Tremendous responsiveness to our needs. We would stay here again any time and recommend it without reservation.

After reading about it in the NYT and checking out their website, I gave them a call. The reservationist gave me a discount on a suite that made it affordable. The suite was large and lovely. The hotel is a renovated Ottoman era building and the rooms are done up in a modernist style. Nice marble bathrooms, kitchens, sitting area, and comfortable bed. My room looked onto an old Ottoman building that is falling to pieces: it was great fun to look at (see picture below). The location is a great quiet side street in Beyoglu--though no taxis have heard of the place and you'll have to use nearby landmarks (like Peri Palace) to find your way back home. It's a 2 minute walk to the Bosphorus, a 5 minute walk from Istiklal and a short cab ride from Taksim. It was a great spot for visiting the meyhanes & galleries of Beyoglu. The only down side to this hotel is its staff. The manager/reservationist who works late afternoons and evenings is wonderful. The rest of the staff was quite new and unsure how to get things done. Room service always sounded a bit surprised when you rang. (I ended up making my own coffee in the morning and heading to the Marmara hotel up the street for breakfasts, from where I could easily catch a cab as well.) If you're in the city for business, you may not get the kind of support you need. But if you're a tourist, they couldn't be nicer and they'll make every effort to help you get what you need (so long as you aren't in a hurry). It was a long but interesting cab ride to the Sultanahmet area where I saw the sites (the Topkapi is a must see)...and I was so glad not to be staying at any of those hotels. I'll definitely stay here again when I return to Istanbul.", "Date": "August 24, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ansen Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d555733-Reviews-Ansen_Suites-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$138 - $314*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Mesrutiyet Caddesi NO: 70</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Tepebasi Tunel /Beyoglu</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34430 </span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "555733", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/2b/a7/6d/penthouse-suite.jpg"}}
