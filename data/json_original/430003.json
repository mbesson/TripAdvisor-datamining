I wanted a really cheap accommodation since we were actually booked in a decent (though a bit more pricey) hotel for the rest of our stay in Singapore and this was just a meeting place for me and my husband anyway. However I didn't want to stay in Geylang (where all the cheap hotels are) mainly because I would be solo for a few hours and was not comfortable checking into a seedy albeit affordable hotel or inn alone (though I know SG is a safe country). Thus I had to find alternatives, and after much research I decided on Asphodel Inn. Admittedly the reviews made me a bit wary but I thought I'd suck it up for one night. After all the rates are the same as Geylang's. Getting to the hotel was a breeze; I just gave the zip code to the cab driver. I was actually surprised with the chic exterior though small lobby of the hotel. I noticed right away that it was situated in a residential area with temples beside it, and a hawker nearby which was good. I specifically requested for a double room on one of the top floors AWAY from the elevators or groups since I read in the reviews that the walls were too thin and you wouldn't be able to sleep with all the noise especially if your room is near the lifts; and my request was granted thank God. Rooms were ok, actually better than I expected. It was clean and well-kept. The bed was big enough. There was a TV with cable channels. Restroom was small but again, expected (though clean in my opinion). There was a closet for your stuffs with hangers and all. The room also came with coffee sachets, a kettle for hot water (very important for me!), 2 bottled water, and toiletries as well. Fresh towels were provided. The only pet peeve I had about the room itself was there was no blanket (I don't know if that was really the case but if it is it's UNACCEPTABLE) and I had to call the reception THREE times to ask for one coz I was freezing. That's the other thing, receptionist could use a bit more customer service (though he was not rude just acted like I was a bother to him when I was asking for my blanket, duh!). They brought me the blanket 30mins after my last call grrr... And it wasn't a very good blanket as well; not thick enough. Anyway I decided to walk around a bit after check-in since I need to buy an SG sim card for making calls. The nearest mall is City square mall, it's about 10minutes walk from the hotel. That walk was fun since I got to see a bit more of the area and found the nearest MRT (Farrer Park) just opposite the mall. So I can honestly say transportation is ok if you're looking for a decent but accessible inn NOT in Geylang. Though I would imagine getting to the hotel with your luggage from the airport might not be so easy due to the walk; just a warning. My husband got to the hotel fine at around 2am and we checked out that morning fast and easy. By then the (younger) receptionist was more hospitable and a lot nicer. All in all I would definitely recommend this inn for those looking for cheap alternatives to Geylang hotels. I am actually considering it for my next SG trip soon.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Herts, UK", "Title": "\u201cRooms need an update\u201d", "Author": "mandaland", "ReviewID": "UR119250165", "Content": "The external and communal areas of this hotel look great - but the rooms unfortunately are not.

The Hotel is at the top of Racecourse road on that map, not at the bottom! Even more confusingly, Racecourse Road is in two sections. It is recommended that you print off a google map of this area before you travel. If you turn left out of the hotel and past the temples you head towards the MRT and shopping Mall, turn right (and right again at Ballestier Road and then continue to walk on Lavender Street) to go to the bus station, (where you can catch the bus to locations in Malaysia), and a superb food hall more or less opposite the bus station (Eminent Plaza) where you can have dim sum and Chinese noodle soup for breakfast and a dazzling array of other Chinese food in the evening. LIttle India is close by, but on the MRT side of the Hotel. There is good shopping to be had and interesting places to eat in Little India. There are multiple exits at the Ferrar Park MRT (stop NE8), it is worth checking the map at the station so that you can orientate properly to get back to the Hotel. If you are up for walking, rather than taking public transport, it is not too much hassle to walk all the way down into the financial district, but bear in mind that Singapore is equatorial and so it gets dark at around 7pm. Day Tickets on the MRT are more cost effective than single tickets and you can get back the S$1 deposit on your rail ticket by feeding it back into the ticket machine. The hotel itself was adequate and clean and our triple room was a bit cramped, but there was no chance of a lie in because of temple building works opposite. The location is not the most up market, but we found it clean especially when compared to KL. Access to the room was at 1pm, but you can leave your luggage there when you arrive if that is earlier.

I paid S$60 the first time and now it is S$90 so the value was really not very good. I would have rather paid more for a place with better amenities and a better location. The staff is about as unfriendly as it gets without being rude.

Thats it. I still not say that it is a value for money. It is not fair to term this place as hotel.. as they provide absolutely no service except the rooms which are very tiny and badly orgainzed. Whole hotel and lobby smells bad. Bathrooms has hot water showers but bathroom hardly has space to stand and take shower. No soaps or shampoo just a liquid soap dispneser installed in your bathroom having poor quality of liquid soap. We stayed there for 5 days (three rooms) and every time we came across to reception there is a new male face on reception but all are rude and mannerless. No exceptions. They behave badly and erogantly. TV is useless in the room as it does not have any channles that can keep you or your child busy. Bathroom water heaters are strage and you can only have shower in lukewarm water. Airconditioners are of lowest quality without remote and Elevator (lift) has problems. They claim to provide hair dryers and Iron but you will never get it as they will say that other guest has borrowed it. No tourist information available. Nobody will pick your luggage to your room. You have to do it yourself while checking in and checking out. And the guy who comes to clean the hotel rooms and lobby is the worst of all not readly to listen to you but always ready to shout on you and he keeps smoking in your room and lobby while cleaning despite of the \"No Smoking\" Stickers everywhere in the lobby. Beds are very small as the rooms. They give two 500 ml Water bottles everyday which ofcourse is not enough and when we ask for water they tell us to drink from toilet tap or wash basin tape. Isnt it ridiculous ? I will never stay at this place again and advice you also stay away from here. If you are looking for cheap accomodation better stay at hostel than this hotel.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "penang", "Title": "\u201ci never stay at this kind of hotel before \"teribble\"\u201d", "Author": "saira119", "ReviewID": "UR13417085", "Content": "i don 't like this inn .it is smelly and dirty. the reception is very rude(man),they are not friendy , not answer for our question and need properly.i feel very bad to stay there .", "Date": "February 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cMeager, but clean\u201d", "Author": "steve15182", "ReviewID": "UR11958549", "Content": "This was not my first choice of hotel by any means. I spent hours online trying finding a room for less than SD$100 on Christmas Day and couldn't get much of anything in the city and I refuse to stay in Geylang. The popular hostels were all booked solid and most hotels have raised their rates considerably in the past few months. Expedia had a reasonable price and the reviews here weren't horrid, so I went ahead and booked it. Asphodel Inn's location is pretty inconvenient with the exception of the Farrer Park MRT station (5 min. walk). The surrounding area is close to Little India, but that's about it. (15 min. walk to Bugis) Sheets were very clean, bathroom was clean and TV had HBO. Shower was part of the rest of the bathroom as the drain was on the opposite side near the toilet, but I just thought of it as character. There wasn't too much hot water coming from the heating unit in-line to the showerhead. No frills at all, but the lock on the door worked and the staff was friendly which was all I was really looking for. A paint job and some interior decorating wouldn't kill anyone and would help justify the price.. But, Do I wish I would have splurged and gone with a modern and more convenient hotel?
