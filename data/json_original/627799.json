For me, is only a place to sleep in at night after going out during the day. At least there is hot water during the morning and night time. The size of the room is really small, so do not bring a big luggage.The ventilation and aircon is a bit rundown but room is clean, with new towels supplied everyday. Comfortable beds and pillows.I booked 2 rooms directly with the hostel. I had some problem with the room lock for one room which I managed to get the staff to change a new room for me.I stayed in the main building which is ard 27 storeys high. Waiting for the lift takes some time but is still ok for me.", "Date": "Dec 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR425859565", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Kaypoh"}, {"Content": "Worst stay ever! My Wife and I have just spent 2 nights at this hotel. We really hated it, the room was not small, it was tiny! The WC which was attached to the room was also very small and doubled as the bathroom, the shower was actually above the toilet so you have to do some sort of tribal dance to take a shower, oh and i should mention the fact that when you get out of the shower you are greeted with any of the belongings you managed to place on the tiny floor space, floating toward you! The double bed was only slightly bigger than a single and was made out of bits of wood nailed together with a thin mattress on top, comfortable it was not, and staff wanted an extra $50 for a second pillow! The lights in the room did not work and the staff were not helpful. From what i gather the hotel has 4 rooms per floor and is 27 floors high with only 1 lift (yes it is a small lift) 4 people max. We could hear people coming and going at all hours too. To sum up, i would only reccomend this place to you if you are very small and have spent the best part of your life couped up in a small cell and you are looking for somewhere to stay with a homely feel!", "Date": "Dec 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR481889371", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "w1johnston"}, {"Content": "Very Nice and Convenient Place       Dim Sum", "Date": "Dec 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR543475121", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Samcrane"}, {"Content": "Not a Bad Choice for Budget Traveler       Cosy Corner Outside the Room", "Date": "Oct 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR433301878", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "CKew"}, {"Content": "Tiny rooms... Most of the twin rooms are about 100 - 110 sq. feet. It was fitted with 2 small single beds, a small bathroom, and a small space on the side that acted as a dresser/ closet. To be fair, if you're traveling alone and do not intend on buying much (i.e. no large luggages with you), then this might not be a bad choice if you can get the room at their low rates. If you're traveling with family, and/ or intends to shop, then do not stay in this hotel. The space is extremely limited and you will find it difficult to put your luggages inside the room. Overall, I would say this hostel is suitable for travelers who simply want to experience Hong Kong (e.g. probably backpackers).", "Date": "Oct 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR372911353", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "tintong1"}, {"Content": "still ok       room", "Date": "Oct 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR820924647", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "R7Lover"}, {"Content": "Poor choice for us. Have just spent 8 nights at this hotel with my husband and daughter. We're from Australia and although it was very cheap, very close to transport and the Temple street markets, would never recommend this hotel or stay there again. The rooms are so small you can't turn around. There is nowhere to put your luggage and the hot water is very spasmodic. The bathroom and floors were never cleaned and even the cups and glasses were not cleaned.We should've taken note of the pictures on the website and been warned but thought at least it would be clean. One positive was when we went to breakfast there was a lady in the restaurant who was extremely friendly and nothing was too much trouble for her.", "Date": "Sep 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR716190228", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ToshHusky"}, {"Content": "Photos can be deceiving... It's a really hard one this place because my terrible experience was probably influenced by the area. First off I got lost trying to find the place for 30 mins in the rain. Hard to say if it was the directions given or my own stupidity.The surrounding area (Kowloon) is so run down and dirty. It put me off of Hong Kong straight away, I couldn't breath (However note Hong Kong Island is much better).The hotel was not much better. I took photos of the room before I left but it doesn't look much worse than photos I saw on websites before. Just looking at photos the room doesn't seem that bad, but it's just a feeling you get in there, it just feels dirty. And there was obvious dirty parts of the rooms, mainly hairs on things including the shower. I didn't even use the shower while I was there, paid for one at the airport instead. The air quality, like outside was poor. There's is a decent LCD TV in there though but that's about the only positive of the room. The room is tiny, but that didn't phase me too much.Watch out because they ask for a deposit, so make sure you keep the deposit reciept and ask for it back when you leave or you might not get it back. If you want cash up front for your deposit back, make sure you pay for the deposit with cash. I paid for the deposit on credit card and they said they would not give me cash back, instead refund the credit card, so while I did get the refund later on, it was a nervous wait to see on my credit card account if I would get the money back or not.I guess if you want a no frills dirty experience, then this might be the perfect place. It is like only 2 minutes walk away from the Temple Street Night markets which is convenient. As long as you don't get lost there is a train station a couple of minutes walk away so that's convenient. What's not convenient at the nearby station is no elevator or escalator to take your luggage down into the train station (I had about 40kg luggage I had to lug down step by step down a big stair case at the train station by myself).I've given it two stars because I haven't stayed anywhere else in Hong Kong so it's hard to compare. If I had stayed elsewhere there's a possibility I would give it only a 1 star. While not expensive compared to a real hotel, it was really bad value compared to all of the places I stayed in Japan which cost about the same, yet people would say Japan should be more epensive.I would not stay there again, however maybe Bridal Tea Houses in other areas would be better. I'll definately be stayin in another area if I come back to Hong Kong in the future. I'm from Australia for your reference.", "Date": "Jun 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR689456178", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "mr_zark"}, {"Content": "Over priced Hostel I find it very difficult to call Bridal Tea House a hotel (and a three star one at that). One may argue that you get what you pay for and, in this case, you get incredibly small rooms, tiny beds, (in the case of my particular room) a bathroom in which the toilet is only three quarters open (it's encased by two walls on each side and a sink directly in front) so you are sitting in the 12 o'clock to three o'clock position, water in the shower being too hot to use or too cold, a refrigerator that only works while you are in the room, and paper thin walls. On the plus side, it is near an MTR stop, they have friendly staff, and it's clean.Why I rate Bridal Tea House so low is the cost. For everything you get get above (good and bad) you get with hostels in Mong Kok or Tsim Tsa Tsui at half the price. I don't think a painting on the wall and flowered curtains on the windows turns a hostel into a hotel.", "Date": "Apr 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR870473754", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Blimey_GZ"}, {"Content": "nice hotel for a budget trip in hongkong       my son in the cr", "Date": "Mar 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR362970414", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "joan_tweetypie"}, {"Content": "Convenient, Clean and Absolutely Affordable       Twin Bed Room", "Date": "Mar 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR454207038", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ship001"}, {"Content": "\u7039\u5908\u4e9c\u9287\u6219\u5022\u9287\u2541\u7568\u8e47\u51a9\u5285\u9287\ue1ba\u4e97\u9288\u5b2a\ue196   showReview(20919254, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR212394538", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "33chan"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d627799-r23248860-Bridal_Tea_House_Hotel_Yau_Ma_Tei-Hong_Kong_Hong_Kong_Region.html", "HotelID": "627799", "Price": "$36"}}
