It was booked by my family in Berlin andit turned out to be a little gem. Situated in Spandau it was central for both bus and Ubahn travel to the centre of Berlin. Hotel was clean,well maintained and comfortable without being in the luxury class. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is taken in a small room but there is plenty of food and staff will cook eggs on request. There is nothing which detracts from this lovely place - great value for money. We'll be back!", "Date": "Jun 14, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR649573769", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d596278-r16830047-Herbst_Hotel-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "596278", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
