We were lucky to find the Staybridge Suites. But let me elaborate on the dual meaning of this sentence: the hotel is perfect for the type of quick and simple stay we needed. Large and clean rooms, with well furnished kitchenette and all basic needs of a tired family duly covered. Excellent breakfast (nice surprise!) the following morning. But trying to find the Staybridge at night upon arrival at Miami Airport was a very complicated task. If you miss the entrance (marked by an unlit sign that is difficult to see) you can wander for hours until you find your way to it. Also, sometimes it may be difficult to find a parking place in the hotel's lot, shared by patrons from a noisy bar in the vicinity. Our rooms faced the parking lot, so we had a peaceful sleep, but I imagine that whoever faced the bar may have had a difficult time trying to sleep. But let these details not miss the basic virtues of the Staybridge: more than reasonable rates, clean and spacious rooms, very polite staff, both at the front desk and at the breakfast area.

Called the hotel upon our arrival at the airport and they said a shuttle would be by to pick us up in 15 minutes. Well, 15 minutes later the shuttle came, which was a pleasant surprise given the fact that the hotel usually only does pickups once per hour, on the hour. Hotel is located 10-15 minutes away in a quiet area next to a Holiday Inn Express. Was greeted by a friendly front desk clerk who provided us with a welcome bag of water and chips for belonging to their reward program. N/S Room was huge with a kitchen area, sitting area, and a king bed. There is a great restaurant bar located just outside the hotel and the complimentary breakfast offered in the hotel is more than adequate with both hot items (eggs, some spam-like hash, waffles) and cold (yogurt, cereals, breads/pastries, fruit). Finding free tables was not a problem. Free internet is also available on 2 computers in their business centre. For those looking for an inexpensive, yet quality, place to stay short-term near the airport, this hotel is perfect. The free airport shuttle is convenient and cost-saving, and the taxi to the cruise terminal was less than $40 without tip.

The breakfast was very generous and continually restocked with hot and cold items -eggs, a meat, 2 kinds of fruit, muffins, donuts, toast, bagels, yogurt, cereals. Breakfast was very busy, and all the seats were full, so there was room but just enough room for everyone. It is far from any tourist sights and is even a bit of a drive from the airport.

We found Trip Advisor invaluble in all our choices when planning our whole trip. We stayed in this hotel for three nights after flying into Miami from the UK, before heading down to the Keys. The check -in was swift and efficient with personable and helpful staff. We had our 22yr old son with us too, the suite had a seperate bedroom with two double beds and TV. The lounge/diner /kitchen had a sofa and further TV. We could not fault our stay, the suite provided ample room for us all to relax and had masses of storage. Storage can be a problem in some hotels of this type as they are often aimed at the business/shortstay traveller, but we had a lot of belongings due to our total17 day trip and this was accomodated very well. The suite and its contents were immaculate in every way, the beds particulary , were very comfortable with quality bedding. The lift requires your room key to operate and the corridors were also immaculate and welcoming. The location worked very well, we used a sat nav to direct us in our hire car and still managed to miss the entrance- but we were tired. The hotel is set well back from the road and is behind the Holiday Inn, so is not immediately obvious. I understand there is also an airport shuttle service. We visited South Beach, various malls etc. all within easy travelling by car, the location was very convienient for our needs. There is a Doral Ale House restaurant in the grounds, where we had an excellent meal and then walked the few yards back to the hotel. We were reasurred by the security man in his golf buggy, but to be fair we did not ever feel in any way unsafe. The breakfast of both hot and cold items was very good indeed, the quality of the food and variety of choice was much enjoyed. We have had many trips to the USA over the years and this was by far the best complimentary breakfast we have experienced.
