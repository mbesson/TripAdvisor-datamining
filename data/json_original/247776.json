We looked at most of the hotels in the Wailea - Makena area and chose the Hotel Wailea for the price and room size. We were not disappointed in any way. The room was very spacious and clean; we did not encounter any of the problems others have reported on this site. The pictures of the rooms on the hotel website are very accurate so there were no surprises. We loved the large tub and shower, and found the kitchen small but adequate. The bed's pillow top was a little too soft for our liking, but few hotel beds compare to ours at home. We selected a panoramic ocean view room and the view from our lanai was spectacular. We had great ocean views, and overlooked half and acre of the grounds and garden. We watched a chef pick fresh vegetables! The hotel grounds are beautiful and expertly maintained. The gardens and fountains are wonderfully relaxing and tranquil. The breakfast buffet was as advertized, and we supplemented it with yogurt we bought at the Safeway in Kihei. We ate breakfast one morning at Sarento's and highly recommend it. All of the staff members were warm, friendly, and eager to help. The valets gave us several rides to the beaches and restaurants in Wailea, and we never had to wait more than 10 minutes. We learned that the hotel was originally built as condos exclusively for Japanese vacationers, and turned into a hotel about 3 years ago. That explains the phone instructions in Japanese in our room. We walked past the Four Seasons and through the Grand Wailea. Both had hundreds of guests \u2013 many, many more than the Hotel Wailea \u2013 and walking through the Grand Wailea was like walking through a combination Las Vegas casino and Disney World. Everything was way over the top and miles from anything else. We ate at Capische the night we arrived. We ate at the bar and enjoyed the meal; the only critique was that the by the glass wine prices were very steep, especially for the wine offered. The Hotel Wailea is perfect for those that don\u2019t have to be on the beach and want a quiet, peaceful, large room with amazing views.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, MO", "Title": "\u201cBest Possible Honeymoon!\u201d", "Author": "Eric S", "ReviewID": "UR125891011", "Content": "My wife and I went to Hotel Wailea for our honeymoon last May and we decided we would never stay anywhere else on Maui. We loved that it didn't have a normal hotel feel. Rather than being door to door with your neighbors, there are four rooms per building. You cant just walk out of the hotel and be on the beach, but it was so much better just being by ourselves. ZIts probably a 15 minute walk to the beach but it just takes a second to drive down there and the bellboys will always be willing to take you down in the shuttle for free. (which is an escalade btw) The hotel premises are awesome. The pictures really dont do any justice. We had an amazing view of the ocean and the crescent island from our room. Every bit as good as oceanside IMO. The grounds are covered with native plants and flowers. One day we even went out and picked fruit with some of the staff. Depending on the season, they have mangoes, avocados, bananas, and apple bananas among others that can be picked. The staff at hotel wailea couln't have been friendlier to us. They were all just super nice and always had a genuine smile on their faces.They would ask us what we've done so far and what we liked as well as tell us what they recommend. They were also very helpful in telling us where to shop and get good local deals on food. While we were in Wailea, we went to the marriot for a luau, the kea lani, for a meal at the fish market, and walked by several other hotels on the beach front, but there is no where we would rather stay on maui than hotel wailea. Plus, hotel wailea is among the least expensive hotels in the area. Assuming your in the market for the same things we were (quiet, beauty, fun, comfort, relaxation), you would be foolish to go anywhere else.

The tile in the shower is painted and the paint is peeling. There was a section of base board trim that had been torn off. The bottom of the doors were chipped. The bracket on the bathroom door was falling off. The light in the living room was too dim to read by. The safe was in the bottom of a cabinet so I had to get on my hands and knees to use it. We returned from a day at the beach and found our back door standing open. If you are in a unit at the bottom of the property you will awaken to traffic noise. The parking spaces are very narrow and require passengers to get out before parking. The koy pond at the bottom of the property is very shallow and full of moss. The flagstone in the lobby floor is painted black. Breakfast was bagles and banana bread. All of the reviews that are a 4 or 5 either minimize or don't mention these features. And a few personal observations; Last fall when I booked this hotel I did so because the reviews on this site were consistently positive. Just prior to my vacation I returned to this site to see how reviews were running. I want to acknowledge my appreciation for those reviewers who commented on the same issues I listed above and offered ratings of 2 or 3. Had they not I would have felt set up and misled by the reviewers who failed to comment on these concerns. Its very apparent to me that these reviews reflect a very broad range of standards. So if you book a room here be aware of that. Needless to say, my wife and I were disappointed with the room. The comments of the manager, in reponse to the same concerns raised by previous guests, feels weak and manipulative to me in veiw of the conspicous level of disrepair of the room we stayed in. Overall the interior spaces were just off. Painting the flagstone in the lobby or the tiles in the bathroom is like something I would expect to find in a motel in the Ozarks. I will say however that the grounds (other than the koy pond) were very nicely done.The exterior of the buildings were nice and I enjoyed walking through the property in the evenings when we returned from dinner. The shuttle service to the beach was helpful and the drivers were friendly and courteous. Having access to beach chairs, towels and dining at the Grand Wailea was also very nice. I visited West Maui during the week and was glad that I had chosen to stay in the Wailea area. Its also fair to say that by staying a few blocks off the beach we probably saved $2000. So at this point I would not recommend staying here. But if the rooms were renovated, the paking issues addressed, the koy pond filled and attended to, the lobby redesiged and the breakfast made more adequate I would. TRIP TIP: I highly recommend a raft ride with the Pacific Whale Foundation. it was the highlite of our trip. Staff was friendly and informative and being in a raft is the way to go. They cautioned people with back problems from going in a raft. My wife and I both have moderate back issues but neither of us had any problems at all.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Moines, IA", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable resort\u201d", "Author": "DSMtravel", "ReviewID": "UR125572258", "Content": "The facility is less expensive than the resorts on the beach.

The Hotel Wailea never pretends to be a beach hotel. It is a retreat. When the bellhops/valet personnel drive you to your unit, you will notice several acres of flora and zen-like streams. And in your room you will find huge space. If you are intent on cooking in the unit, please notify the desk before you arrive. There is virtually everything that the desk personnel will provide. We asked for and received a microwave along with enough dishes and cutlery for a quick meal. Because the unit is also equipped with a stove top, you might wish to ask for a pan and a knife and spatula. We noticed several guests bringing back juice, fruit, breads to their unit to enjoy on their lanai. With cereal and yoghurt purchased from any of the stores, a sufficient meal is made. I particularly like the General Store in the Shops of Wailea for its freshly made meals. For our first night, we purchased a Bento salmon and chicken along with a bottle of pinot grigio. This was a wonderful first night's supper. The shuttle drivers are all too eager to drive you to the Village or anywhere in Wailea. We took advantage of this service almost every day--sometimes twice--and left our car in the lot. With gas approaching $5 a gallon, it makes sense to use the car only when leaving the area. Since this service is included in the resort fee, tipping is entirely optional. One never \"had to tip.\" Many activities are planned each day, from a fruit picking walk on the premises to yoga classes, the guest can do as little or as much one desires. The pool area is safe and well stocked with towels and complimentary cabanas. Although not entirely connected with the hotel, Capische? offers each guest a complimentary appetizer at the bar. We highly recommend the bar not only for the appetizer but for an opportunity to sample local dishes at great prices. House wines are a bargain at $6 for red and white (a chianti was poured one night, a pinot grigio another). Those who blanch at $200-300 tabs can sample the fare at the bar during happy hour (5:00-6:30) for a fraction of the cost at the restaurant. If you are indeed fortunate, you might run into a supremely gifted hoteliere, Ann Ikuta, who works at guest relations and just about everything else. In fact, it was she who caught us exactly a year ago exploring the grounds. She offered to show us a unit, the only one not occupied at the time. It was a partial ocean view on the ground floor, but it was still wonderfully spacious. Her kindess convinced us to reserve a week this year. And we are still smiling! There is only one thing I would change--immediately--and that is the choice of newspaper. We come to Maui to escape the Wall Street Journal. We implore the management to at least have the Maui News as an alternative. After all, if one wants to learn where Willie K is performing or what the local weather will be like in a few days, the local paper is the better choice. Of course, we \"used\" the shuttle drivers for our daily paper run in the Village. Yes, rooms are indeed being renovated and more will be updated in the future. But I would rather stay in a place that has heart and soul than in a place in which one remains a number.

The lobby was beautiful with an open-air reception area and a breathtaking view of the water. The room, however, was a bit disappointing. We were expecting a boutique hotel-quality room when what we got was a converted condo. The bedroom was nicely decorated, but everything else needed a facelift (peeling paint, dated fixtures, a shower with a hose that eventually gave way mid-shower). We were also disappointed to see that although there was a large sliding glass door in the living area, the only window in the bedroom was a small, square panel that resembled a drive-through window (which is what we called it throughout the trip). You couldn't even see the ocean from the bed. We also had a bad experience with the ocean club. The Hotel Wailea doesn't have direct beach access, though they will gladly shuttle you to an area of the beach that is directly behind the Grand Wailea. So far, so good. What didn't work, however, was the communication between the hotel and the company they have hired to manage their beach service. We only had one afternoon to go to the beach during our stay, and when we got there, the company that was supposed to provide us with towels and boogie boards was closed, about an hour before they were supposed to be. BIG bummer because by the time we figured this out, the hotel shuttle was long gone. When we mentioned it later to a couple different hotel employees, their reaction was less than satisfactory. We have discussed our complaints regarding the hotel and ocean front with the manager and were satisfied with his response. It's just disappointing that Hawaii doesn't seem to offer any small, modern, trendy boutique hotels. We have been told that the hotel owners in Hawaii don't need to modernize their hotels because many of the people that go there don't care about modern amenities, and those who do still seem to go anyway.

Great banana lilikoi bread, papaya, pineapple, juice, bagels, coffee, etc. Since this hotel is not on the water, but just a couple short blocks up the hill from Wailea, they provide a free shuttle service down to the town of Wailea. This worked out perfectly. We called from our room, walked up to the top of the property, and the cadillac escalade was waiting for us. Also, included in the price (which includes a resort fee) is the use of the beach in front of the Grand Wailea (chair, umbrella, and water by an attendant). Perfect :-) We will be coming back to Hotel Wailea", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anchorage, Alaska", "Title": "\u201cNeighborhood Boutique..Service above and beyond!\u201d", "Author": "CindyH38", "ReviewID": "UR123950002", "Content": "My husband and I very much enjoyed that this boutique hotel was set in such a nice neighborhood setting.

Our only location request if we were to stay again, would be to stay in one tier higher building, as ours was on the front, closest to a somewhat busy street. Service is what sets this hotel apart. We couldn't ask for a friendlier, more helpful staff during our stay. They all became fast friends, remembering our names, sharing recommendations, asking how our adventures were, and genuinely expressing their joy in what they do in contributing to their guests stay. The rooms/suites are large and comfortable, linens divine! Loved the large open shower and could see all they way out to the ocean while washing my hair!..Updating is needed in the bath (stained) and kitchen (only 1 burner worked), but I hope they don't change the layout. Grounds are absolutely lovely and even saw a nene strolling in the yard one morning. Never swam in the pool, but the area looked comfortable and inviting. We did enjoy the unusual, but not-to-be-missed spa after the long \"Road to Hana\" and again our last day on the island to freshen up after we had checked out before our late flight home.

In terms of positives, the location is just fine, the grounds were pretty and the unit had a small screened patio with two chaises and an incredible, elevated view of the ocean, including Molokini, with amazing sunsets. (The hotel is not beachfront.) The units seem to be primarily condo style, with four to a building. Now about the space. While there is plenty of room, the decor is very tired and the carpeting and furniture are worn. The combination kitchenette/dining/living space had inadequate lighting - ceiling fixtures only and no lamps. In fact, it was too dark at night to read while sitting on the sofa. There was a mini fridge sufficient for holding sodas and some orange juice, but not much space for anything else. There was a bar sink, and an old electric burner stove. We were hoping to cook some local fish, but there was no way given the size of the kitchenette and dearth of kitchen equipment. The bathroom, while comprised of a large shower and tub, a separate toilet, and a sink area, was also very dated. There was a really weird, large attachment to the toilet relating to water flow with instructions in Japanese. Although the bath area had a large closet, the configuration was such that it felt pinched, with too many doors. The lobby area was almost always (oddly) vacant. There was no \"nightlife\" during our stay - not even a bar for a drink in the evening as the restaurant was closed for renovation during a good part of our stay. The complimentary breakfast was comprised of stale bagels and an urn of not so great coffee. The pool area was small, but nice and also quiet. The pool area bar was not open at all, so no tropical drinks by the pool. There apparently is beach access near another oceanfront hotel, and although the staff touted \"signing privileges\" at that (unrelated) hotel, one must pay a fee for recreational activities and spa access privileges. We had ongoing difficulty with wireless access. This place is a good value for anyone not wanting to be cramped in a hotel room, but it felt akin to camping.

Our friend got married in Maui. It was such a highlight that the room didn't matter, but one couldn't help but notice a few things... What you see on the website is not what you get. There is a reason why they don't have more pictures of the rooms. I don't know how everyone rated this hotel as excellent. They call it a Luxury Boutique Hotel. Yes, some things are what you would consider luxurious, like valet, bathrobes, nice bed linens, and a very well manicured property. The rooms are far from luxurious (aside from the size) - the bathrooms are not luxurious at all - the shower head went up to only half my head so I had to dunk in order to wash my hair. There is no chance I would ever use the bathtub...it was stained and uninviting. The Aveda products are the simplest Aveda products, in fact not very good for my hair and very small, if you have long hair, you better buy some of your own. We didn't mind that, but again it's about being luxurious. There were stains on the carpet (which was gross by the way), there were stains on the couch, the terrace door didn't lock, and both, the doors and screens are very, very old. The lounge chairs on the terrace are extremely old, the whole living room is old, the closet had a different carpet than than the regular carpet, even worse looking and smelling. We seem to also get water bugs in old rooms that are not well kept. This time we found 2 of them! They are huge! We had ants in the bathroom, I think that's enough, really! We had the Panoramic view, but didn't really get a view as there were so many trees blocking it, not worth it! I think 'panoramic' is a misrepresentation of what it actually is. Our teenage kids were in the room below us and they had the same problems with ripped couches and rust...to mention a few. I rated cleanliness as average because of the state of the rooms, there is no way that carpet was clean.... The good - the bed, pillows and linens were fantastic, hence I gave the room an average review! The grounds were nice as well. Beware, there is Nothing going on at the hotel, it is very quiet, I think the bar closes at 10 or something like that. Spend a little more money and stay somewhere else. The chances are you won't spend that much time in the room, but when you do, wouldn't you want to feel comfortable? we didn't feel the luxury unfortunately as, among other things, every time we went to the bathroom in the middle of the night, we had to turn on all lights just in case there was a bug around, so that we don't end up stepping on it...not very pleasant. This spot has so much potential, if they were to renovate the rooms and incorporate some fun music at the bar and actually create a night life for their guests and atmosphere, it would make such a big difference, and we would pay more to stay there.

It could be so much better than it is. It should be better. Hotel Wailea has many things going for it: excellent location, beautiful grounds, private beach access (access to a private section of a beach with generous public access), spacious and quiet rooms (many with knockout views), a Japanese-style \"hot spring\" spa, friendly staff (if not quite enough of them). With the suite-style units, you get the feel of staying in a high-service condo, without the usual crowding or pool party scene. You have access to beach services -- and a hotel bathroom, which is a huge plus -- without having to stay at the massive, crazy-busy, noisy, beachfront Grand Wailea Resort. Unfortunately, my husband and I encountered some issues. The bathroom in our unit was split into a toilet room with a door, a sink area with one door and an open side, and a tiled \"wet room\" done in the Japanese style where the hand shower is mounted on the wall next to an extra-deep tub. There was no door on this, which led to both privacy and moisture problems. The unit's only closet was directly across from this bathing area -- in the same room, if you consider a pass-through area to be a room -- and the back wall of it showed signs of extensive mold. A slapdash attempt had been made to disguise the damage, but the paint was bubbled and peeling, badly patched, and falling off in bits onto the carpet. The carpet in the closet did not match the more recently installed carpet in the rest of the unit, and was dirty and not vacuumed. There was a plainly visible hairpin on the floor in there when we checked in, and it was there when we left. (Yes, I keep tabs on things like that in hotels). In the kitchenette, the drain in the small sink had slime in it, as did the bottom of the drain plug. The coffee machine smelled sour. Ants appeared. I rewashed all the dishes we used and scrubbed out the coffee machine myself. The Japanese-style spa was both the greatest surprise and the biggest frustration. The facility is fabulous, but there is no attendant and no posted instructions on how one should bathe before entering the soaking pools. People will behave badly when given there is no one around to keep them in line. We saw people bypass the bathing stalls and go straight into the water. We encountered a couple who were soaking naked (forbidden), and we were forced out one evening by a rowdy group of guests who decided to party in there. But where the lack of an attendant was most evident was in the mess thoughtless guests left behind. Used towels were strewn about, used soaps and their wrappers were left in the bathing stalls (in the waterfall shower, many days-worth of old soaps were stacked on the divider). I went around and collected dirty towels and put them in the baskets before I soaked just so I wouldn't have to see them. Some spa features weren't operational. The general impression was \"deferred maintenance.\" Definitely not what you want to see in a spa. It could, and should, be so much better. Hotel Wailea is showing its age, but a hotel can age gracefully, or at least try to. I left there feeling that management was taking shortcuts.

We very much enjoyed Hotel Wailea. It's better, I believe, for adults, as opposed to families with younger kids, because the Hotel itself, other than a modest swimming pool, doesn't offer much to keep young kids happy--that's what the beach is for; or if the kids would prefer a big resort with sprawling pool, slides, etc., this is not the place for that. The grounds are immaculate, the property is quiet, and the views are wonderful. When you're on the upper level of the two level units, the lanais offer a beautiful view of the ocean in front of Wailea Beach--a wonderful way to wake up, have your coffee, and plan your day. A tremendous feature of the place is the shuttle service to anywhere in the Wailea Beach area, from the beach access to the Shops at Wailea. We never had to take out our rented car (and if I'd have known this, probably wouldn't have rented a car--just taken cab to/from Kahului Airport). But we chose not to travel the island (since we'd been there before). Obviously if you choose to ascend Haleakala, drive Hana coast, visit Lahaina, Kaanapali, Kapalua, etc., you'd need your own rental car. But if it's the beach and the Wailea area you are interested in, it's much more convenient to use their shuttle service and avoid the parking hassles. They would meet us to take us back to the hotel with virtually no wait time on our part. The rooms themselves are spacious--our king-suite had a separate seating area, large bathtub, separate shower, and separate sink area and closed-off toiled. There is also a kitchenette with burners, sink, and small fridge. Good for basic food storage, not heavy food preparation. Wi-fi in rooms is included, as is use of fitness center (somewhat limited in terms of number/type of machines/equipment, but awesome view), and sauna/jacuzzi/spa. The staff was very accommodating. I called the front desk when I couldn't get my wi-fi connected to my iPhone. Within a couple of minutes, I received a call from their local Time Warner carrier to walk me through the issue. As for beach use, the Hotel has an arrangement with the Wailea Beach Club to use their location (directly in front of Grand Wailea hotel, mixed in with their residents), beach chairs, and umbrellas, and you can charge food/drink at the Grand Wailea to your Hotel room if you desire. This served our needs perfectly each time we went to the beach. Although there was some limited space/umbrellas/chairs, we never observed anyone not able to get chairs and umbrellas. You can also rent water services/sports (snorkeling, kayaks, canoes, etc.) from that Beach Club. It seems the main issue to me are the following choices: is being beach-front a necessity (ie, the ability to walk downstairs and out of your hotel onto the beach)? If so, Hotel Wailea won't work for you, but you'll pay perhaps twice as much to get that in the Wailea beach-front hotels. The second issue is that some areas of the Hotel Wailea could use some modernization/sprucing up. For the most part, I was fine with the \"dating\" of some of the features (such as parquet wood floors in rooms and common areas, and the classic designs of some of the common spaces, such as cocktail/breakfast area--oh yeah, they offer a modest but tasty and adequate breakfast included...something you won't see at many places). But some of the areas could use updating, like the toilets in the rooms and showers in the spa/sauna area. However, these were not significant issues to us considering the vast different in price point between Hotel Wailea and the Wailea beach-front properties. It comes down to what is most important to you. There are many nice touches here--the beautiful fish pond as you enter, and the excellently groomed grounds and flowers, for example. I would definitely choose this hotel again, OVER the mega-resorts in Wailea, because I prefer the quiet and groomed grounds to the long walks at the mega-hotels, and because I really valued the shuttle service. Also, the restaurant at the hotel, Capische? is reagarded as one of the best in Maui. We ate there and had two of the best fish dishes we've ever eaten anywhere.

We have stayed at full service 4 and 5-star hotels and condos and by far this was at the top of our list and will definitely return. The Hotel Wailea is located away from the busier hotels at Wailea Beach up the hill just a short drive to the beach. Our family of 4 arrived a day late due to our airline and also had problems with our rental car (having accidentally locked our keys in the car). Needless to say this wasn't the best way to start a vacation, yet the staff at Hotel Wailea (Meegan, Emily and others) were very accommodating upon check-in adjusting our reservation, allowing us to check-in early AND greeting us with a complimentary meal and drinks (service recovery for something that had nothing to do with their hotel is certainly a step above). We stayed in 144 which is on the second level and on the edge of the property with beautiful views of the Pacific, Molikini and Lanai. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious. As mentioned in other reviews, certain elements of the room could use some updating (countertops, modern toilets, etc). The kitchenette is small but adequate for beverages and light snacks. If you prefer shopping at grocery stores and cooking every meal on vacation this isn't your place. BUT if you value privacy, quite and beautiful setting and top notch staff then look nowhere else. During our visit, we enjoyed the pool and spa on different occasions and felt like we had the place to ourselves. At most we saw 2-3 other couples (honeymooners) and one or 2 other families with small children. The Japanese style spa is a definite bonus with a large hydro-therapy jacuzzi pool with beautiful views of the ocean and Northwest Maui -- again we rarely ever saw anyone else using it. The pool is smaller but offer complimentary cabanas and a bar -- complimentary mai tai happy hour on Tuesday. The beaches at Wailea are just a short shuttle or drive down the hill from the hotel. If you are a family, inquire with the bell staff as they provided us during our stay complimentary boogie-boards, umbrella and beach buckets for our kids (leftover from prior guests) -- well worth the tip and saves a trip to the ABC store. The large 5-star resorts at Wailea sit on the beach and Hotel Wailea has a beach club (which we never used due to crowds) and signing privileges at the Grand Wailea. My only problem with these hotels are they are very crowded and you have to walk forever just to get to the beach and to/from your rooms. Its hard to feel like you're \"getting away from it all\" with all of the commotion, towel carts, fighting for chairs and umbrellas, etc. It was simple to drive our car to the less crowded section of Wailea beach closer to the Four Seasons or Polo beach near the Fairmount (public access with free parking). Complimentary breakfast at the hotel is catered by the Aloha Coffee shop in Wailea (fresh bagels, breads, fruit and coffee). We ate at the Monkeypod kitchen, Pita Paradise and Cafe O'Lei in Kihei -- upscale casual restaurants recommended by the hotel and all excellent. The hotel has a 5-star restaurant onsite (we never ate there) but it looked excellent and has received numerous awards.

First of all, the room is HUGE--I know that they're all suites but I found the floorplan to be much more open and spacious than other suite-type hotels, eg embassy suites, etc. The decor was modern, the bedding was luxurious, the bathroom was also huge with a jacuzzi type tub as well as a shower which had three knobs, one that regulated flow, temperature and pressure. We did not use the kitchenette (there were no pots or pans--they probably need to get some if they expect ppl to cook). The view was stunning, as we had a relatively large balcony with a view of the ocean. The staff was super-friendly, accommodating and helpful--and they don't treat check-in like a cattle call like some other resorts do. They took the time to explain all the amenities the hotel had to offer e.g. morning yoga, free drinks on Fridays, etc, where the beaches are, etc. The lobby was breathtaking--open air with a view of the ocean, waterfalls, koi fish ponds. They have continental breakfast every morning which is basic but has little touches that make it good like their fresh baked breads and guava juice. You also see the attention to detail like orchids placed around the property and staff constantly cleaning throughout the day. The pools--clean, not a lot of people and very quiet. This is very different than the Grand Wailea where there are a ton of people and just too much stimulation. My daughter loved wading in the pools here without having to worry that another kid was going to knock her over. Probably not a place for big families as my 3 yo daughter was the only child we saw the whole time, but she is relatively quiet so it was fine and this environment definitely suited her (and us, the parents) better. I could see how we might feel self conscious if our family was louder. Saw a lot of couples.

The hotel grounds are perfectly manicured, fresh flowers lining pathways, stairways etc. I even made my wedding bouquet from these freshly picked flowers. The hotel is quiet and peaceful, we often had the pool or spa to ourselves. The Grand on the other hand looked like a zoo filled with children running around. We were treated by the staff on a personal level, not as a number like some big chain hotels. The rooms, massive!!! Living area with a big lanai equipped with sun loungers. The living area had a sofa, tv, dining table and coffee table. The kitchen had a fridge and basic cooking facilities but with all the fine dining options in the area; who wants to cook anyway? The bathroom was fantastic, huge walk in shower, big deep tub. Previous reviews have complained about the privacy of the bathroom as it is open but you can shut it off from the main living areas so not a problem. There is a separate toilet. Also a huge sink area with mirror for getting ready. The wardrobes are massive too. We had 2 large cases and 2 small ones and could easily store them inside. The bedroom also has lots of draws for storage, a tv and the most comfortable big bed I have ever slept in. We had a seaview, well worth the extra money, the sunsets from the lanai are amazing. I was getting married whilst staying at the hotel and they were very helpful with anything I needed. Some previous reviews have also complained about the breakfast. Well let me tell you, it was fabulous. Fresh coffee, tea and juice, Banana bread, mango bread, a choice of several different types of bagels, toast, fresh fruit, jams, phillidelphia etc. We ate late most mornings and they were continuously restocking the food as it ran out. The views from the lobby area were the perfect Way to start the morning. There is a $20 a day resort fee but I think this is standard for the area. But this includes a shuttle service anywhere in the area ( which we made full use of and was very prompt every time) wifi in the rooms, breakfast and valeting. I didn't mind paying for it as wifi alone in some hotels can cost $10 a day!! Trust me I experienced this during our multi destination trip. Parking is also free which can cost in hotels. The pool area was great, with big comfortable cabanas, which were always available. The spa was refreshing at the end of the day and the gym adequate. But if you are a fitness fanatic then the grounds would make a lovely run. I would definitely stay here again, it was a perfect wedding / honeymoon destination. Don't get why others have said they would rather stay at the Grand Wailea. Oh nearly forgot there are complemantary sun loungers, towels and water on the beach down at the Grand Wailea but there are nicer quieter beaches around, hire a car and enjoy the drive around the coastline!! We did the sun rise Haleakala tour, which was out of this world, the road to Hana, which is unmissable and drove to Lahaina, which was well worth it. Didn't rate Capische but other restaurants in the area are Gallons and Joes for fine dining and even Matteos for a budget dinner! This hotel provides a quiet, romantic, beautiful location not directly on the beach, but the views make up for it. If you want the hustle and bustle of a bigger resort and the beach directly outside then stay some where else!

First, let me start off that we are both big fans of the Aqua hotels group, and have stayed with them in several different locations. So much so that a few years ago, when we were married on the beach in Oahu, we all stayed in the Aqua Aloha Surf in Waikiki. For the uninitiated, the Aqua formula is simple. They take great properties that are usually getting on a bit in age, and transform them into unique hotels and resort properties. Some of the other reviews here make comparisons to the Four Seasons or the Grand Wailea, but it is apples and oranges. If you're looking for a self contained resort, where you can arrive and stay on the property for a week without running short of things to do, then no, this hotel may not be for you. On the other hand, as a quiet home base from which to explore Maui, the Hotel Wailea was exactly what we were looking for. The Hotel Wailea is another fine example of the Aqua formula. A former club catering to Japanese tourists, the hotel is very spread out, which makes it seem that you might have the whole property to yourself. Several times my wife and I wondered aloud whether there was anyone else in the building with us. For those of you coming to Maui to escape the crowds, Hotel Wailea may be the answer. Each of rooms has a small kitchenette area, with a fridge and two burner stove. On request the hotel will bring a set of pots, pans, dishes, and a microwave. For those of you planning a long stay, the fridge is a bit on the small side; we used it to keep some eggs and juice handy for our in-room breakfasts. While we are on the subject of breakfast, there is a free continental breakfast in the lobby, fruits, bagels, toast, and the all-important coffee. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is a basic breakfast, which is why we paired it with some freshly scrambled eggs and juice back in our room. I could probably write an entire review just on the restaurant, Capiche? Now, as an Italian, I am wary of restaurants with funny Italian names. My fears, it turns out, were completely unfounded. The food was all good, however the best parts were the appetizer and desserts. Not that the entree was bad, it's just that it didn't stand out as a meal I would remember for months after eating it. The pumpkin gnocchi and creme brulee, on the other hand, are out of this world. The hotel is up the hill a bit from the much more developed beachfront, and I would venture to say it is out of reasonable walking distance, however there is a free shuttle that is on call to take guests around to the beach or pretty much anyplace in town.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cI wouldn't stay here again\u201d", "Author": "travel_london_se1", "ReviewID": "UR116960565", "Content": "There are so many great things about this hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but, unfortunately, there are more things which are pretty bad.

As a middle aged couple it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter to us that the hotel is not right on the beach and we loved sitting on the huge balcony, stretched out on the loungers and enjoying the fantastic view over the ocean. After we did a whale watching trip we discovered that we could easily see whales from the balcony! The room was very spacious with a little kitchenette, a dining table with four chairs, and a large sofa. The bathroom was large with a bath and walk-in shower with the toilet in a separate room. The public areas are beautiful but essentially useless. There is tons of space but nowhere that you would want to sit. Now for the problems. We had a kitchenette with a sink, a small fridge and two rings to cook on. There were plates and cutlery but no cooking utensils. Why bother to provide cooking facilities but nothing to cook with. Oddly, when we rang to ask for a few pots and pans they said they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know whether they could find any. How odd. We were told that a free breakfast was available. Well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sort of. It amounted to a trestle table set up in the lobby with some thermos flasks of coffee plus a few bagels. It looked as if someone from town was coming in to earn a bit of extra money. When we checked out we discovered a $20 per day \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd charge added to the bill. What for? They said it was to cover the cost of parking, internet, breakfast, the shuttle bus, etc. etc. The receptionist said, first that there was nothing they could do about it and then that most hotels in Wailea impose this charge. I found this charge to be underhanded and very bad practice. If they had just charged me $20 a day more for the room and given me \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd internet and shuttle bus (we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the parking or the shuttle) I would have thought it was great. However, by trying to hide this charge I was furious when it suddenly appeared on the bill. For people on a budget who may have chosen this hotel based on price this could be a very nasty shock. Looking online it could well be true that this is common practice in Wailea. In that case, my advice is enjoy Maui (which is fantastic) but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay in Wailea.

The refrigerator was tiny; enough to keep a few groceries, and some drinks, but you can't stock up on groceries for the week. The beds were small, and somewhat uncomfortable. The room includes an odd layout. There was no door between the shower and the bedroom; not a big deal, but at times, was an inconvenience. 2. The pool - very very average. Just a basic, average-sized pool; no waterfalls, slides; nothing special. We didn't use the pool during out stay. 3. The gym - included a bow-flex with missing parts, and an elliptical machine. Not a big deal, since we snorkeled and hiked for exercise, but was expecting a bit more for a resort-type hotel. 4. Location - about 1 mile from the beaches. Our balcony did have a partially blocked ocean view, which was nice, but it would have been nice to be a bit closer. Aside from the restaurant in the hotel, the closest places to eat were about 1/2 mile away. Very very quiet location. 5. Breakfast - a nice touch, but only bagels, banana bread, sliced pineapple, and juice/coffee. Got old by day 3.

It is not as convenient as staying on the beach itself, but it's about half the price so if being on the beach is not the priority, this will cost you about half as much as the hotels on the beach in this area. They serve a continental breakfast which is okay.

This property was much more quiet and quaint than our previous accomodations. We planned this to be the \"relaxing\" segment of our trip. Free Mai Tais by the pool. We met the owner on our first day, who just happened to be in town visiting the premises.. He was very cordial and friendly, asking the bartender to pass out another free round of Mai Tais.. ;) This used to be a private country club, so the grounds are spread out. Accomodations consist mostly of \"quad style\" condo units. Our bathroom was huge; the living area faced the ocean, and we had a small kitchen and patio area where we could watch the sunset. The \"free\" breakfast consists of bagels, fresh breads, coffee and juices.. Plenty to eat, and completely satisfactory. We ate at their restaurant, Capische, one night (DELICIOUS truffle risotto!!).. A romantic view from the outside area is prime.. Get reservations! Good service. We enjoyed a day at the nude beach several miles down the street (great people watching, btw).. Had some issues with neighboring guests who were staying in a room below us. I called the front desk to complain at least 3 times btw 2-4am because the guests were loud, playing music and yelling during of the early morning hours. I assume the front desk eventually took care of the problem because we never heard anything more about it. THE MOST WONDERFUL thing about this hotel that I can report is: I accidentally left a beautiful, new bathing suit in thier spa area after taking a shower the day we flew back to the mainland.. I didn't realize it until the next day when I was unpacking. I called the hotel, and thankfully, they had found it! More than that, they immediately put it in the mail and returned it to me in North Carolina.. For this reason alone, I will revisit this Hotel when I return to Hawaii in the future. I was really impressed with the customer service.. We thought the price was very reasonable for Hawaii.. The units are a tad dated, but completely clean and satisfactory. If you want to pay $800/nt for complete luxury, stay at the Four Seasons down the street.. Otherwise, Hotel Wailea was fine.

But since it is no longer focused on the Japanese market some things are missing. The washing stations at the onsen mostly didn't work, and there was no stool or bucket to sit on; plus most westerners don't know to wash before entering the bath. Also, the water temperature was only lukewarm, probably another concession to western tastes. The pool was a favorite hang out with comfortable cabana's.

There was a collection of dust and debris along the wall mouldings and behind where the end tables were. Our bed sheets had some stains on it, but I am assuming they were clean sheets but the stains didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come out from cleaning?! The amenities in the room such as free internet, Aveda bath products, and free bottle water upon arrival in the room, and bathrobes were nice touches. The fans and air conditioning were well appointed and the bed was extremely comfortable. The kitchen area was a waste of space in our opinion. The overall room was very spacious and quiet (top floor room). The fitness center equipment is in need of updating. Two of the machines (elliptical and treadmill) weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fully functional. I brought it up to an attendant that happened to be there and he said that both of the machines are working now and then left. The elliptical machine by the window was still out of order and the treadmill defaulted to a set program that you needed to override every few minutes. Regardless I still appreciated having some fitness equipment then not. It was also nice that they had a fruit infused ice cold water cooler available for your workout. The pool area a good size, and the pool chairs and cabana beds were comfortable and well maintained. The complimentary shuttle services and daily activities they offered were great. It was nice not to have to drive after dinner especially if you want to have a few glasses of wine and cocktails. You may have to wait 10-15 minutes for your shuttle to pick you up, but it is better than waiting an hour or two until you sober up to drive. We enjoyed the Honolulu coffee and continental breakfast items (bagels, oat cakes, juice, and fresh fruit). If you have too many choices and overabundance of items to choose from, people will generally eat too much and waste food. This will keep you waste line trim for the beach!

The landscape, lobby, and views are gorgeous. The property has lots of flowers and waterfalls everywhere. The bellhops are genuinely nice and will engage you in real conversation about Maui if you show an interest. The front desk folks also had a great attitude and good sense of humor. The rooms? It depends on what your expectations are. We had a \"renovated\" room with a kitchenette. It reminded me a little of a budget ski chalet rental. The carpet was clean and free of tears, though it was a kind of low-knap industrial weave. The view out the window (especially the sunset) was amazing, and you have your own terrace. We had a large, open shower and separate bathtub and, in a separate tiny room (Japanese style) the toilet. Everything worked great. That said: A close look at the sink showed its finish was peeling on the inside. The landline phone didn't seem to work (though who uses a landline anymore?). The cable TV had \"blank\" channels on it (so I re-autoprogrammed it). There was a kitchen, but the fridge was so small that we couldn't fit a half-gallon tub of ice cream in the tiny freezer. The floor-length accordion shutters over the sliding glass door didn't shut all the way because of a protruding screw. The room was also a bit removed from the main area with the lobby and the parking lot. Not horribly so, but just enough to be slightly annoying. But it has to be that way when the hotel consists of quad-plex townhouse-style clusters, instead of a giant tower served by an elevator. And the bellhops do have golf carts. But the bed was great. The shower was great. It was quiet (other than the noise one morning from a street-sweeper truck driving on the small street along the back of the resort). We had the kitchenette there, should we have chosen to use it. (Fair warning: It's not much more than a tiny sink, a hot plate, and a dorm fridge. You can get them to deliver a microwave. No idea why they don't just leave the microwaves in the rooms. Maybe they're low on microwaves.) Don't know about wi-fi, but they have a free business center where you can print your boarding pass. And best of all, the price of $140/night via Jetsetter was fantastic. It's the only reasonably affordable option in Waliea. We were a quick drive from several beaches. The pool had plenty of shade and nice pool furniture, and they even showed a movie there on Saturday night. (Alas, it was \"Rush Hour.\") Is there a lifeguard? No. You should know how to swim or stay out of the water. It's a pool, not the ocean. I will say that management should give strong consideration to turning that unused kiddie pool into a hot tub. There's a small on-site laundromat right by the pool; I loved being able to wash clothes on vacation. Really lets you pack lighter. I loved being able to park our rental car--and on Maui, you NEED a rental car unless you want to spend your entire time at the hotel. Hotel Wailea does have a few reserved umbrellas at the multi-hotel Wailea Beach. It's a quick ride on the hotel shuttle. Once you get there, you have to go to the correct beach stand to ask for towels and then go to the right area. But Big Beach, a short drive from the hotel, is much less crowded and low-key. By the way, If you stop at the fruit stand near Big Beach, ask for prices first! I paid $10 for a coconut. Speaking of overpriced food: We skipped eating at Capische, because I'm not paying $40 a plate for Italian food. And I'm not eating at a restaurant whose name is an expression used on Jersey Shore. It's true that Hotel Wailea's free breakfast is nearly the same every day--but hey, it's a free breakfast! And it was pretty good: bananas, pineapple, papaya, coffee, a couple of kinds of juice, banana bread, several types of bagels--all included. What are people expecting for free? An omelette station? Steak and eggs? Come on! Keep in mind that at the $400/night Grand Wailea nearby, breakfast is on your dime. If you go in expecting the sheen of the Four Seasons, Kimpton, or W, you're going to be disappointed and angry. If you have read my entire review and can handle the quirks--if you value the money-saving amenties over a sense of luxe poshness--then Hotel Wailea is for you.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burr Ridge, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cParadise NOT found!

Previously, I had stayed for two weeks at the once amazing Renaissance Wailea, which no longer exists. If you aren't aleady aware, Wailea is a very exclusive resort area, and in my mind the beaches are second to none in Maui because they are protected coves with great privacy, excellent snorkeling, and less intense wave action than some of the other beaches. Other hotels in the area include the elite Four Seasons, the grandiose Grand Wailea, and the beautiful Fairmont. In all fairness, I had no expectations of the Hotel Wailea being close to the above three, since its nightly rate was about half of the others, but was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. My wife has been to Hawaii nearly twenty times, and stayed at many of the notable hotel/resorts, so I really hoped the Hotel Wailea would be a nice surprise. Initial Impressions: Easy to find, beautiful upscale Wailea area, nice private drive and easy parking. Nice breezy and island modern architecture of the main building with its open floorplan and scenic rotundas. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful. Bellhops were friendly and available, and drove golf carts to ferry guests and luggage to their rooms. Very good initial impression. The grounds: On the way to the room, one had to admire the beautiful grounds. Not so well maintained as the other big hotels, but very nice with waterfalls, wooden bridges, streams, hedgerows, colorful crotons, hibiscus, and other tropical foliage giving a very naturalistic island feel. Cut flowers were strewn everywhere, literally on every step on the staircases. The room, initial impression: At first, the room appeared very nice. It was on the second floor of what were essentially four-unit bungalows facing the ocean, on the manicured grounds. Nice direct ocean view from the lanai, but since the hotel is not on the beach, but a few blocks away and up on a hill, it was a bit distant and obscured by trees. The room appeared clean, but the furniture and fixtures were pretty old and a bit shabby, clearly close to the end of their usable life. Aveda bath products. Overall, passable at first impression, but buoyed a bit by friendly staff and the pretty landscaping. Restaurant, Capische: The Restaurant was interesting: only open for dinner so no lunch available (except room service), small (basically just a long balcony), five star prices ($40+ for any entree, a la carte), they are not kidding about the romantic view at sunset (amazing!), poor service with somewhat disorganized college kids?, bartender was very friendly and efficient, food was somewhere between a strong good and very good, but not excellent. On our walk from our room to the restaurant, there were no signs on how to get there, so just followed the pathway up toward where the restaurant was. In doing so, we accidentally entered the first floor, looking for a stairway or elevator, but instead found an empty second restaurant (Japanese) that was no longer in business. Beautiful empty room, but adjacent to this was a private dining for Capische, with tableside hibachi grills (their advertised private event space, apparently). What was pretty off-putting was that the private room was full of dirty dishes and a mess from some previous party, and no one to clean it up. Major thumbs down for cleanliness there, but this was not intended for our viewing - though no signs directed us to the correct pathway up to the restaurant. Prior to the setting sun, we noticed that bar area was slightly run down with peeling paint. Our waiter was in a hurry, unhelpful, and had no interest in making our experience special. I must say, however, the table next to us had a great waiter, and we listened to his descriptions of the entrees to order. I had the pork chop, wife had the chicken with ratatouille. I must say that I would give the restaurant a 3/5 only due to its good food, and view; however, with the strict note that cleanliness is very suspect, but mainly due to its association with the hotel. The Chef, if a rising star as claimed, should find a new location independent of the hotel. Later impression of the room, the next day: After more time in the room, the initial impression wore off and we started noticing the hallmark feature of the Hotel Wailea, poor maintenance in every way. The restaurant hinted of that, but now we were sure. The linens were old and stained, my wife would not sit on the couch because it looked really worn and old (think college dorm), the TV while new hung crooked on its bracket (and could not be straightened), and the large room was only cleaned enough for a first impression - it was actually pretty dirty, and not acceptable for longer than a one night stay. The shower was totally inoperable, and a large patch of black dirt was on the shower floor, uncleaned. Upon close inspection, the room was outdated, furnishings and fixtures were old with worn finishes, and overall the room had a grungy feeling that creeped my wife out. My wife, an early riser, received an angry call from the neighbors after making a cell phone call from inside our room, to be quiet - obviously the walls were paper thin. Some of the other guests looked like they were attending the local Harley Fest, with head to toe tattoes, not exactly the typical Wailea resort clientelle. Post-initial impression was of poor maintenance. Breakfast: Cream cheese, bagels, and banana bread kind of like the continental breakfast at a Motel 6. Coffee was not even warm, but cold. Bad coffee, in Hawaii? (This explains a lot about the place). My wife got food poisoning shortly after eating the banana bread, and was really, really ill for most of our second day in Hawaii. The only places we had eaten were Capische the night before, and she ate the \"breakfast.\" Avoid the breakfast like the plague. Park at the Shops at Wailea and grab a bite there or walk to the Grand Wailea for a five star breakfast. Work-out room: My wife, who works out a lot at Lifetime Fitness, tried to use the beautiful workout room, advertised as \"new\" on the Hotel's web site. The machines were almost all non-functional, including a treadmill that mysteriously would increase speed from 1mph to 7mph in order to try to introduce your to the wall. Another guest from NY was there, and could not use the machines either. False advertising here, broken machines. Staff: Like a ghost town, there is almost no staff to speak of at all at this hotel. Either they don't exist, or they were hiding. Front desk good, bellhops great (friendly, fast, and helpful), restaurant waiters average, and no other employees seen anywhere during our stay. Spa: Spa looked huge and nice, but again looked a bit run down with some tiles coming off the wall. It was totally empty the three times we entered to check it out. Pool: Looked beautiful like the pics on the web, but was not maintained. No pool staff at all, no lifeguard. Pool furniture was nice, but starting to look a bit soiled. Many, many tiles were missing from the pool (a shame since initially it had those beautiful Italian glass mosaic tiles), and a huge black bug hung under the lip of the pool near the drain, making my wife cringe. We were at the pool for maybe three hours. The pool bar had no food menu, nor was any employee staffing it, except a girl who we some enter the bar toward the end of our time there, but never saw here again. Looking behind the bar revealed no beer or wine, taps, or anything else besides some towels and a single Igloo cooler. Bar: Restaurant Capische has the only \"real\" bar in the hotel, besides room service, and its only open for dinner. The pool bar was no bar at all. Public restrooms (pool, lobby, restaurant): horrible, as dirty and run down as high school or roadhouse restrooms, shameful of a hotel in this area. Inexcusable and disgusting. Maintenance: despite what was already mentioned, from which you should get a good idea on why to avoid this place, it must be said that during the time we stayed at the Hotel Wailea, one day and part of another (mostly staying on hotel grounds), we never saw any maintenance personnel or management at all. No maids, no groundskeepers, no serving staff cleaning up the private dining room, no janitors, no security, no pool cleaning, no tower person, no nothing. Either the hotel has laid everyone off, or Management has decided that the slow decline into a skeleton staff and increasingly obvious poor maintenance and facility damage were a good selling point for repeat guests. Conclusion: The biggest tragedy about the Hotel Wailea is that the property is a million dollar gold mine of beautiful vistas, already-there landscaping, and nice architecture - why Management is throwing that all away and wasting its amazing potential is beyond me. I did see two new Cadillac Escalades in the parking lot to be used as guest shuttles. Whoever decided that Aveda products, Escalades, flowers everywhere were enough window dressing to merit guests repeating their stay ... that person cannot see the forest for the trees! Advice: Avoid for a better hotel, and certainly don't stay long - one day was too much for us! If you can grab a discount rate at the Fairmont or Hyatt (wife later found out rooms were similarly priced here, and hotel was beautiful, restaurants very good too).", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cDoesn't live up to the hype\u201d", "Author": "ChicagoGirl30", "ReviewID": "UR115031306", "Content": "I was very excited when my husband planned a surprise trip to Maui.

Which leads to my next suggestion, update your gym with machines that work. I am a marathon runner and work out everyday so I was excited to use the hotels facilities. Only problem was that only 1 machine worked. Also the pool was nice but needed some fixing. It was missing many tiles.

We were really excited given the excellent reviews here on Tripadvisor, but were disappointed about the value we received for our money - which was next to none. We had paid for a partial oceanview room, and the first room we were given had a view of the back of a row of hotel units and no ocean was visible. We requested a change and were moved to the only other room they had available - it was a lovely gardenview room, and had the tiniest glimpse of the ocean between a couple of palm trees. At least the well-manicured grounds were lovely to enjoy. The room was very clean and huge. As we were out sightseeing most of the time, we barely used all of the space. We had very little and then only intermittent hot water in the shower. The pool area was also very nice and we enjoyed it often. We had a rental car and so did not use the hotel shuttle to go to the beach, but found that while the hotel setting was beautiful, the beach felt far away. That being said, driving to the beach was easy, there was lots of parking available, and we really appreciated having the beach chairs and umbrellas available to us. The beach was gorgeous and was a highlight of our trip. It would be walking distance, if you had time and could stay out in the sun for long periods of time. Another disappointment of staying at the Hotel Wailea was the breakfast. It consisted of the same two kinds of fruit, banana bread, and bagels every morning, with juice & coffee to drink. There was no variety at all. Given that the main staple was the bagels, we had to take to eating elsewhere as the bagels were just too heavy for us to eat every day, and the fruit was not enough. I suppose it depends what you are used to eating every morning, but we were surprised not to see a tiny bit of variety introduced (no muffins, cereals, breads, other kinds of fruit, nothing at all!). We highly recommend splurging on the breakfast at the Grand Wailea, which is delicious and set in a beautiful open-air terrace - well worth the extra money! Also we found the service to be excellent at that resort. That brings us to another surprise - we did not find the staff to be very warm. No one acknowledged our honeymoon, in spite of us mentioning it at the time of booking, and upon our arrival. We realize that most clients staying in Maui are probably on a similar vacation, but while it may not be special to anyone else, it was important to us as we only get to do it once! Nothing about our stay was made to feel \"special\". While we were treated with courtesy, there was only one staff member, who was previously mentioned in the reviews below, who did behave very proactively to try and make sure we had a great stay in Maui. The other staff at the front desk were less than helpful when approached, and we seemed to always get someone different. We do have some general advice for those of you considering this hotel: - If you want a room with a view, pay more for it and request to be on the upper floor of the vacation units. - If you are staying on the upper level, please be considerate that there are people below you who also want to have a great trip. The buildings are absolutely not soundproof and we were kept awake by some very loud television and party sounds coming from those above us on a couple of nights. The area is very quiet at night, so you will sleep really well if not for loud neighbours. - There is only one bar, on the pool deck, and though it had hours posted, they only opened when there were lots of people enjoying the pool area. Often it would not open until mid-afternoon (sometimes hours later than posted). Be aware that there is room service during the day, but it is really expensive. The restaurant is only open in the evening. - Wailea is an extremely expensive area. Be prepared to pay a lot for your food as well as accomodations. We found that some restaurants were tasty (we loved Pita Paradise) but they were overpriced for the amount of food you received. Capishe, which is located in the hotel, was a lovely evening's experience, but we were disappointed with a very bland main course after enjoying a delicious appetizer. (Being of Italian background, we may be spoiled with better home cooking than most, however). Our advice would be to stay in another area of Maui to try and get better value. We felt that we overpaid for a very mediocre experience. Given the nature of the other hotels in Wailea, we felt as though we were staying at a budget hotel in a 5-star area - not a nice feeling to have on your honeymoon! We felt misled by the Tripadvisor comments: this hotel is NOT a luxury hotel, though the area is a luxury area.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arnold, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cHoly SPA!\u201d", "Author": "travelingprincess3", "ReviewID": "UR113524124", "Content": "We arrived at this hilltop resort and immediately fell in love walking to the open air lobby. I think we could safely judge this book by its cover. We only booked this resort for 2 nights, spending the majority of our time on a different area of the island.

The grounds were immaculate\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6waterfalls, bridges, lush foliage, and pretty flowers were along the path the golf cart took us to our room. Our building had 4 units, ours on top with a very nice spacious balcony overlooking a pond. We had a one bedroom (with pull out couch in living room), small kitchenette, dining table, and spacious bathroom with a large soaking tub and huge shower. Our room had vaulted ceilings with ceiling fans in both the living room and bedroom. This bed was so comfortable; it was hard to get out of it when the alarm clock went off. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was updated and the unit was very clean. The pool area was a bit more upscale with the white wicker loungers and 4 poster wicker beds with canopies around the pool with Tiki torches. The best was yet to come\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the spa! We all wanted to quickly take a peek at the spa before cooling off at the pool. We ended up spending the rest of the evening at the spa. I even heard a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd out of my 5 year old niece. We initially had the entire facility to ourselves before others found this little piece of heaven. After walking through the modern vanity and massage rooms, we made our way back to the open air cylinder shaped room containing the huge 3-part spa with waterfall, about 15 open shower stalls along the cylinder walls, and rain shower\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.Holy Heaven, I could live here! Starting off in the mosaic spa with mosaic beds, we relaxed our muscles before hitting the rain shower. The rain shower had two mosaic benches to sit while the strong pressured stream massaged your back. This entire are first reminded us of the Turkish bath we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve experienced in Istanbul. The absolute only thing missing out of this area (besides the masseur in their underwear) would have been the heated marble slab to have made this a Turkish bath. We all ran around trying everything as if we were children who just arrived in the North Pole. The next room over contained some very intriguing showers that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve yet to see similar to a car wash. The water pressure and 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of jets looked incredibly relaxing, but we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure out how to heat the ice cold. We all washed our hair in both the rain shower and in one of the hand held shower heads located in the spa area just to hold on to the smelly good mint shampoo that they had out for the guests to enjoy. We did not eat at the restaurant for lunch or dinner, but did have the complimentary pastries in the morning on the one day we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave before it began. They had a very nice spread of pastry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, bagels, fresh fruit, banana bread, juice, and coffee and it was delicious. The only downfall, if you could call it that, is that this is not a beach front property if one is looking for that. However, you can catch the complimentary transportation to the beach at the Grand Wailea. I would highly recommend this resort. You would definitely need a rental staying here as there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything in walking distance.

We got a great deal on a panoramic ocean view suite. At check-in, we were told that we had been upgraded, which was odd since I booked the panoramic view suite originally. It seems they may say this to a lot of the guest based on past reviews. The nice receptionist stated we were getting one of the recently renovated suites. It definitely was nice, but based on the hotel's description of the room we were supposed to have 180 degree view of the ocean. We definitely had a great view, but some our view was over their gardens. In addition, I would have preferred to be on the second floor because the sunset view from our lanai was obstructed by a street light. That was kind of a bummer! The bathroom setup was a little odd like other reviewers stated, but we enjoyed the open shower because it made it easy to spray off our feet after the beach. Bed was very comfortable and we slept great. Kitchenette was a microwave and a small refridgerator. One thing that really bothered me though was one of the main recess lighting in our living room buzzed like a insect zapper. We reported this the first day and they said they'll fix it, but it never was fixed. So we just didn't use the light! It had to be a known problem, but would've involved replacing the recess lighting. As for the the hotel staff, they were all very friendly and accommodating (except for the light issue). The pool area was great place to relax with music, drinks, towels and nice cabanas to nap in. A perfect place for couples! The beach accommodations at Wailea Beach were very accessible; they always had an umbrella and lounge chairs available. The hotel itself is not on the beach, but very close to everything in Wailea, plus there is the nice shuttle service with the hotel's Escalade. We went to the Irish restaurant Mulligan's on the Blue and saw their dinner show featuring Willie K. It is a must do in my opinion! The hotel's restaurant Capische was outstanding, but be prepared to pay for it. Make a reservation close to sunset and you won't be disappointed. As for in the future I would definitely stay here again because the price was much more reasonable than other resorts. If you are travelling with kids this wouldn't be the ideal place because there isn't much for them to do.

After doing a lot of research, Hotel Wailea seemed like the ideal spot for our needs, and it did not disappoint. After a 14 hour travel to Maui, they made things very easy upon check in. A cool towel and bottle of cold water was available. We got to our room and unpacked right away. The room was in great condition. The only downside was there were very small ants in the bathroom sink. I am not an outdoors person at all, but this didn't even bother me. They weren't all over, just in this one area. The maid service was great. I think they only didn't come one out of the six days we were there. We didn't need anything that day, but the front desk was always helpful, and I'm sure if there was any needs (towels, etc), they could have helped us for that day. There's a mini fridge which was okay for our needs. Mostly used the fridge for water and left overs. We didn't really cook anything in the microwave in our room, other than a cup of mac and cheese. We ate out the rest of the time, I'm on vacation, I'm not into cooking which I do the rest of the year at home. There is room service which was way too expensive for my tastes for what is on the menu. The hotel restaurant, Capishe, is close but expensive. This is a true high class restaurant, which means small portions, big price. I'm not that high class myself to appreciate it, I'm more comfortable at Red Lobster. If high class is your thing, Capiche is for you. We split a meal and I had a couple drinks all for $100. Glad we decided to split the meal! The grounds are beautiful, the koi pond is relaxing, and the pool is never crowded. The lobby has a simple breakfast every morning. It was perfect for us, as I'm not into stuffing myself the moment I crawl out of bed. It filled us up enough to start the day. As I mentioned before, the staff was very friendly and helpful. The last day our plane didn't leave until 10PM. We could have had a late check out, but our room was already reserved by another couple so they offered to store our luggage in their office. We left for Lahaina and came back around 6PM and picked up our luggage with no problems. The only thing I would do differently is get a less expensive room. We had a full ocean view, but were rarely in our rooms. We were always on the go. Our room was great and so was the view of Molokini. I feel I wasted the view since we were only there in the morning and late at night. I would go back in a heartbeat. Perfect for couples who want peace and quiet. You're far enough away from the crowds and the beach is still close by for a shuttle or drive. We were there during the Tsunami scare, and I slept through the sirens. We were far enough inland and high enough were we were not evacuated. They did take some other people at other resorts into their lobby that had to evacuate, so we had a few other guests for breakfast. This shows how inviting and friendly they are at this hotel. This ends my review of Hotel Wailea....below is some info for those looking for what to do while there: Everything is close by. My GPS (TomTom) did not give very good directions when typing in an address. The address system is off in Maui or something, I was always directed 2 blocks north on Kihei Rd when typing in an address. Once I got use to this, it wasn't that bad. The restaurants were okay, some better than others. In Kihei area, I'd recommend Da Kitchen, PuPu Lounge, and Fred's Mexican Cafe. The only beach in the area we went to was Wailea Beach, so I can't comment on the beaches. Lahaina was nice. I wouldn't mind staying in that area with kids, it is more crowded than the Wailea area. Lot of shopping, not cheap. Cool Cat Cafe was great, and so was the Old Lahaina Luau. The one place I would say stay away from is \"Bubba Gump Shrimp\". I felt this was a safe pick for our last day on the Island. The food was pretty average at best, but the service was aweful. Some of the worst service I have every had in my life. I think it was just us. Everyone else seemed to get good service around us. We were seated and I asked that we not be by the \"window\" because we were suffering from a bit of heat stroke and wanted to be in the shade. They seated us and after awhile of waiting, others got seated after us and drinks served before anyone came around to take a drink order from us. I eventually stopped a waitress who said she wasn't our waitress, but I got her to take a drink order from us and food order while we had someone's attention. A second person served us the food which was pretty bland. No one came by to fill up drinks or see how we were doing. The other tables were treated better than us. After eating, I eventually flagged down a third person to see about getting a bill. A fourth person brought us a bill and said to pay it at the bar. I brought it to a fifth person at the bar who was surprised I was bringing a bill to them. They asked why I didn't pay my waitress and I explained I don't even know who that is, and I was told to bring it here. I paid the fifty dollar bill and left very unhappy. I am glad to say that this was not a common experience on Maui, but I personally will never go to this Bubba Gump again, and probably never another one. For the Road to Hana, I suggest doing it backwards. We approached Hana from the south. There was barely any traffic, and the views were 10 times better than the northern half. We got the the Sacred Pools and took the 2 mile hike there towards the waterfall. One of my favorite things, but make sure you have some comfortable sandles or watershoes. The path is filled with roots and rocks and there's a couple streams to cross that regular shoes are not an option. Hana of course is not as impressive as the drive. We spent too long at the Pools and by the time we made it to Hana, all the tour buses were already coming the other way. The tour bus drivers are A Holes, especially on the narrow roadways where they rather run you off the road than share it with you. As for shopping, I suggest going to the Swap Meet in Kahului at the Community College.

Slightly annoying to deal with the big hill up to the lobby but the pool and lobby were great. Breakfast was good continental and really good juice and coffee. Got a nice deal from otel.com which I'd never heard of but worked out great. This hotel is not on the beach. It's only a 3 minute drive down the steep hill to Wailea Beach and the hotel has a deal so you get beach chairs and umbrellas. Not bad for a place not on the beach. Unfortunately, it ends at 3pm which isn't great if you want to relax and watch the sunset after a morning journey. If you're looking for hawaii beach time, i think any hotel in hawaii not directly on the beach may not be the way to go. It was a bit cheaper, yes, but I was jealous of everyone who had walk to the beach access and chairs and towels past 3pm. Wailea is great. The paved path around is great for running and all the beach areas provide great swimming. I think in the end I wouldn't stay here again only because it's hawaii, and I came to be near the ocean. Since you can't walk there, parking and dealing with being wet and getting back in the car weren't ideal.

This hotel is really best suited for travelers that are more independent and interested in exploring all Maui has to offer versus those who want a full resort experience... if you want to just walk out of the hotel and onto the beach, this hotel is obviously not for you. There really is not way to walk to the beach from Hotel Wailea -- well, there is, but the route is indirect and the walk is long. The hotel is set up like a condo -- four suites within one \"house\" structure. I actually loved that because it meant we could come and go without having to pass a ton of people, the front desk, etc. It's just perfect for people who really appreciate privacy. I thought the housekeeping was not too thorough and the times they arrived seemed inconsistent, but that's not a huge deal for us. The ability to park our own car versus use valet (we hate waiting for someone to fetch our car) was a HUGE PLUS! I won't complain about breakfast as a lot of other people have. I considered it a \"plus\" versus an entitlement. We only went a couple times and it wasn't great but that's no big deal. If you want a real breakfast, just head to any number of fabulous Maui restaurants. One disappointment was the beach, which I kind of anticipated from some of the reviews here. The Hotel Wailea shares the beach (all beaches are public anyway) with The Four Seasons and Grand Wailea. It was hard to find the Hotel Wailea beach service -- it's actually outsourced to another company so that was a little confusing. I think it was called \"Ocean Adventures\" or something? They just hand you ONE white bath towel (no beach towels?!) and tell you to find your own lounger under an orange umbrella. Here's the problem: there were only 5 orange umbrellas on a beach (when we went) packed with blue umbrellas from the other hotels. I have no idea why they don't set up more loungers. If we planned to spend more time on this particular beach, I'd be more disappointed but it's not a big deal since we prefer to be at a new beach everyday. I will stipulate we only went to the Hotel Wailea beach a couple times, so maybe on other days they actually did set up more loungers. I think the hotel has some kinks to work out in terms of process -- for some bizarre reason, our check-in took 15 minutes because the guy at the front desk had to explain to us every little detail of the hotel, its spa offerings, its activities during the week, etc. I really am not interested in any of that after a very long flight from Chicago -- I can figure it out for myself later and would prefer if someone just checked me in quickly and got me into a room ASAP. That say, we LOVED Ayumi at the front desk who is just excellent. I think some of the negative reviewers here must've gone to Hotel Wailea expecting a five star hotel experience akin to a Four Seasons or Ritz, or a resort. There is a reason the Hotel Wailea is priced MUCH more reasonably than the Four Seasons or other nearby resorts -- but I think overall the value for the price is great. This is just not a resort hotel, which was actually a huge plus for us since we don't spend much time hanging around a hotel anyway. There's not a lot to do on the grounds besides sit around the pool (which is pretty much a slightly larger version of a swimming pool in a California suburban home). The restaurant, Capische, is very small and definitely not priced to eat at daily. The room service is extremely limited to a handful of pastas and maybe pizza? Unimpressive but again, no big deal since Maui has tons of great restaurants. I would recommend getting a panoramic ocean-view room (if you care about the view) because the ones that are just ocean-view seem to have obstructions. Luckily we were upgraded but our original ocean-view room had its ocean-view blocked by someone's house! The suite was large, very comfortably furnished, attractive, etc. The bathroom situation was a little unusual, as others have noted, but perfectly comfortable and serviceable. We really appreciated the free internet access from our room. The view was great. We could see Molokini! While this would be a great place to stay for small families (I think all suites are just one bedroom?), I just want to note that I appreciate how ADULT the atmosphere is. There weren't tons of kids running around, which as a couple on vacation without children, we really appreciated. Now that we've seen what an utter playground the nearby resorts are, we would not consider staying there until we have kids of our own.

If we did it again we would get a full ocean view because the panorama from the front buildings is that beautiful. The suite was large and very clean. There is a bedroom separated by wooden screens which can be pulled shut, which allows one to get up without disturbing the other. The bathroom is a little different too. The toilet is separate and enclosed. The tub is sort of open to bedroom, though, as is the separate but adjacent shower. It works fine for couples, but perhaps not for others. There is a kitchenette consisting of a mini fridge and 2 burner stove top. On check in, we were told that we could get cooking utensils but without much enthusiasm. In the end, we ate cold food there, but it worked well enough for our needs. There is a dreaded resort fee, which has been reduced from $25 to $20 they said. This included parking, and the breakfast, so it wasn't as bad as it might seem. The pool area is nice, and rarely crowded. We went at in the evenings at had it to ourselves. If you hate getting into a cold swimming pool, this is the place for you, the water was near bathtub temperature. I've seen criticism of the continental breakfast in reviews. We found it to be very adequate for what it is. There are apples, grapes and pineapple; bagels for toasting, and a variety of banana bread type loaves. We were at the coffee place at the tony shopping centre down the hill, and saw the exact same items for sale, and weren't cheap. Finally, there is the landscaping. Acres of flowers, ponds, an orchard and expansive lawns. A great place just to wander around. Of course, nothing is perfect. At least with an iPhone, wifi was weak and unreliable.

Although the hotel was sold out, we didn't notice. As opposed the the hustle and bustle at the Fairmont, the Hotel Wailea was quite and charming. The room suite was comparable as well, spacious with a great view of the ocean. That said, the bathroom and kitchenette could do with an update (although the shower was great). We had the best meal of our trip on the deck of Capiche, the onsite restaurant. I would definitely recommend a reservation at sunset. When making this reservation we were hesitant about the fact that the hotel does not have direct access. What we found was that the hotel beaches were overcrowded and not nearly as impressive as the other beaches in the area. Like most visitors to Maui we had rented a car and the hotel is a 5 minute drive from Big Beach, a far more enjoyable setting than the hotel beaches. For those looking for more amenities, the hotels escalades run regular shuttles to and from their own private area on the Grand Wailea Beach.

We were upgraded upon arrival to a suite and our rooms were a bit dated but very comfortable with kitchen and huge bathroom area; each function of a bathroom having its own room. We slept incredibly well, almost too well bc we missed some of our planned activitoes, in the king sized bed and blackout curtains. Breakfast was disappointing as it was mostly every possible kind of bread item one could think of and not much else. The juices were great, though. At the time we went, there was no pool side service and the restaurant was only open for dinner but that wasn't a problem for us as we were always at the beach, traversing the perimeter of the island by car or on a whale-watching excursion. Oh, yes, we would watch for whale tails from our balcony, and being the mating season it was like a game of connect-the-tails and make up a new constellation. It is up on the hill, on the non-beach side of the main road (main road in Wailea is rather pleasant and doesn't really seem a road to city dwellers like us) but the hotel provides free shuttles service to & fro ( fyi...the fro part is not like clockwork) the nearby beaches which belong to the big resorts but we often walked and considered it our vacation exercise.

The bed was large and comfortable and overall we had a very relaxing time. However, we had issues with the hotel and the room. The issues with the room were niggles rather than major, but could easily be sorted out. Examples were that there was a small kitchen in the room. Only one of the two rings worked and the warmer did not work. The TV in the lounge is too high and to the side on the wall when viewing from the sofa. The room was great during the day with the views, but once the sun went down the room was rather bland and lighting was poor. The issue with the hotel is that it charges a 'resort fee' which is on top of the room tariff - we were told that the fee was to cover the continental breakfast, the shuttle service, valet parking, the beach area and free local phone calls. There was no option not to pay so if you did not use these services we resented having to pay a fee for items we did not use when there was no possibility of opting out. We assume that the hotel does this so it can advertise a lower tariff - which is a bit cynical. The hotel has a restaurant which is a high class Italian style. This is great for a special event, but not where I would want to eat every night.

Arriving late evening after nearly 24 hours in airports, we were greeted enthusiastically by friendly, professional bellhops. Throughout the entire rest of our stay, they made a point to greet us by name and go out of their way to offer assistance. When we checked in, we were given cold bottled water and some wet towels for refreshment. Our vacation got off to an incredible start when the front desk worker noted that not only was our request for a renovated room honored, but we were being upgraded from a partial oceanview to a panoramic oceanview at no charge! Room: -Incredibly spacious!!!! -Fresh flowers were left throughout the room. -Beds were very comfortable. -Showers were slightly different as others have mentioned, but it didn't bother us at all. -Kitchen didn't have many utensils, but when we requested a knife from the housekeeper via a note, it was left for us. She was also kind enough to leave us little pumpkin baskets full of candy on Halloween! -The room wasn't the fanciest I have ever stayed in, but it was clean, comfortable, and very spacious...and THE VIEWS!!! -The views from Hotel Wailea have to be the very best of the island. We spent nearly every early morning on the lanai watching the sunrise and hurried home at the end of the day to catch the sunset with some wine before getting ready to go out for dinner. It was breathtaking and definitely one of my favorite parts of our trip. Breakfast - We couldn't understand why any previous reviewers would have complained about the breakfast. We loved it and missed it on the days we had to head out early! -Fresh breads, muffins, fruits, juices, and coffee. The bread comes from a local bakery, and the banana bread is the heavenly kind you imagine when you think of Hawaii. Oh what I'd give for a slice right now:) We always left full and ready to take on the day....without the feeling of heavy bacon, eggs, and potatoes! -Breakfast is served in a second floor, open air lobby that plays host to an incredible panoramic view of the ocean. Waking up doesn't get any better. Grounds -Absolutely gorgeous. Extremely well-kept. -Each day new flowers were put out throughout the hotel...on walkways, staircases, towels, chairs, etc. -In the evening, candles and torches were lit throughout the grounds and walkways, creating a romantic atmosphere -My favorite spot after dinner each night was definitely the poolside canopied sun bed. Surrounded by island foliage and tiki torches beneath an incredible starry skyscape, this was our nightly stop between dinner and bed. -Tried both the gym and spa facilities. Both have amazing views!!! Gym could use better equipment but it was well-kept. Enjoyed the spa, but it's difficult to understand unless you read the material in the hotel room book. Overall Hotel - Capische? Restaurant is unbelievable in views, food, and service. See my review for details. -Every staff member went out of their way to create a memorable guest experience -A select activity was offered each day (yoga, manager's reception with drinks and live music). We really enjoyed the fruit picking mission with the groundskeeper. Had an awesome time picking our own fruits on the grounds, and they were kind enough to bring some more fruit to our room later that day. That's just the kind of place Hotel Wailea is! -You use the same beach as the Four Seasons and the Grand Wailea! It's just a few blocks down the road. As for those who made previous comments about the beach chairs, we used them and thought they were fine. Apparently, we didn't look too out of place because several guests of the other two hotels tried using HW chairs! -Catered primarily to couples or adults. Didn't seem to offer kids activities and general structure of suites are not conducive to families A few suggestions for HW: -Rooms could use better towels -Renovate the lobby restroom. It's out of place with the beauty throughout the rest of the hotel. -Keep it a small boutique hotel. That's it's charm:) Bottom Line: Hotel Wailea is a gorgeous boutique hotel with less than 100 rooms. It may not have all the amenities of the larger hotels, but it more than makes up for in charm. A true Hawaiian gem. Friends could not believe our pictures (some of the shots taken from our lanai looked fake!), but what really shocked them was the price - approx. $150 per night (via direct booking/special offer)!!!

I was a little hesitant initially because the property wasn't directly on the beach, because, after all, we were visiting Hawaii(!), but the website seemed to indicate that it wasn't far, other reviews were good, and the price was reasonable, at least compared to other \"luxury\" hotels, so we went for it. We were not disappointed: from the moment we arrived, until we left, we were continually impressed The grounds were beautifully landscaped and maintained; the rooms were clean and luxurious, with a large, nicely appointed bathroom and a small fridge, stove and kitchen sink, which was very handy, although we never actually cooked there(!). Our room overlooked a road but it wasn't heavily trafficked, and beyond the road, the view encompassed luxury homes and hotels, with the Pacific on the horizon. Very peaceful, and we enjoyed a couple of evenings sipping wine on the balcony. However, and this leads me to my only complaint, the photos on the hotel website, which seem to me to be all young, \"beautiful\" people, many of whom are on the beach, are both misleading and a bit off-putting. First, the hotel is probably a mile from the ocean. Perhaps a relatively easy and pleasant walk (although we were too busy with other activities to actually test that assumption), but definitely NOT on the beach. (The \"amenities\" section on the hotel's website does indicate \"shuttle\" service to the beach, which implies that the hotel is not on the beach, but the photos, IMO, are still misleading a bit.) Second, the images of young people laying around in swimsuits did not seem to convey the actual feel of the place (at least not when we were there). I have nothing against younger women laying around in bikinis soaking up the sun(!), but we DID see that type of scenario at another large resort we visited briefly to have a drink, and that hotel radiated a very different atmosphere: LOTS of people by the pool. sipping drinks, talking, music, hustle and bustle, etc. The Hotel Wailea was nothing like that, and in fact, that's one reason we enjoyed it so much: it was just...peaceful. Of course, it may be different at a different time of year, but still, I'm a little puzzled by the hotel's Marketing folks: I would think they would want to emphasize that serenity, while at the same time, targeting a broader mix of potential guests. So, website photos aside, if you're looking for peace and quiet; comfortable, clean, luxurious, and roomy accommodations; a pretty decent continental breakfast; and a convenient location from which it's not too far to get to nearby restaurants and shops and to hiking trails, parks, snorkeling areas, and other activities, I would highly recommend this hotel.

I deducted a star on cleanliness because I noticed that they didn't vacuum or mop the floor in our unit for the duration of our stay. Although they might have swept the floor with a broom - I'm not sure on that one. Sorry I'm a clean-freak I'll admit it myself. There were also little ants in our kitchenette even though we didn't leave any food out of the fridge. They really didn't bother me though but I thought I'd mention it and let you guys know. They serve a continental breakfast every morning which is relatively healthy and fast so you can get on with your day.

We took advantage of the advance purchase option on their website and got a really great deal for an oceanview room. The service is fabulous at this hotel. We did not encounter a single person on their staff that wasn't extremely pleasant. The beds were SO comfortable! We really enjoyed having so much space, and the kitchenette was really helpful for storing our own snacks and beverages. I e-mailed the hotel in advance to request a \"kitchen set\" with extra pans/plates/utensils for the kitchen (learned about that from a review on Trip Advisor) and also asked for a DVD player. Both were in our room when we checked in. The pool is really nice and it was never a problem to get a covered cabana. We went into the spa as well and LOVED the hot tub. It's HUGE, so it's not uncomfortable at all if others are in there. We ate at Capische our first night, and it was excellent as well. It was always easy to get our car from the valet. We left too early each morning to take advantage of the breakfast, so I can't speak to that. We also never took advantage of their beach shuttle - we just drove to the beaches on our own. There were a few negatives, but I still think the hotel is an excellent value and would definitely stay there again. When we first arrived, there were quite a few ants in the kitchenette near the coffee maker. We called the front desk and they sent someone to deal with it while we were at dinner. Never saw them again for the rest of our stay, so in my mind this is not a big issue at all. Just wish they would have caught it before we did. One thing that did bother us was the carpet. There were quite a few very large and obvious stains, which made the room feel dirty. This is my biggest complaint, and it definitely wasn't the best thing to see right when you walk in the door. If they would fix this, it would really improve the perceived quality of the room. The pool bar was closed while we were there, but there was a sign instructing you to call the front desk if you wanted to order something. The service was kinda slow, but not a big deal. I was just happy that we didn't have to walk around trying to find someone to give us a drink! The most impressive part of our stay is this. When we left the hotel, we forgot to get a large sum of cash out of the safe. REALLY stupid move - I thought my husband got it, and I thought he got it. We were at another hotel the next day when we realized it. We called Hotel Wailea and they immediately knew what we were talking about. They had tried to call the only cell phone number they had for us (which was dead) many times, and were so worried that we had gotten on a plane back to the mainland without our cash. When we went to pick it up (and they asked to see my ID - thank you!), they told us the story of how worried there were about it, and you could tell they were sincere. I checked my voicemails for the cell phone that was dead, and sure enough, they had called us before we even realized the cash was gone. Very impressive!

That is high praise and anyone who has travelled through the Greek Islands (Mykonos, Ios, Santoini, Naxos...) knows what I mean. the room was large, comfortable, clean. The grounds were amazing. The spa (free outdoor pool, indoor hot pools...) were awesome and perfect at 9:00PM before a drink and socializing with friends.

This Hotel cost 50% per night than the hotel Wailea and it was a huge diappointment. Noisy, busy and quite unfriendly. Hotel Wailea included free wifi, parking, breakfast and shuttle service. At Royal Lahaina they wanted $10/day internet, $10 per day parking and $20 for breakfast. Looking back, I wouldn't have minded those extra charges at the Hotel Wailea because it was just that good, but Royal Lahaina - not. the other thing to consider is that by end of October, Lahaina and Kanapali get windy and rainy so we ended up driving to Wailea to go the beach everyday.

The beaches are a short drive, which is fine as the less touristy beaches (Big Beach or Makena Beach) require a short drive anyway. The morning breakfast is a big step up from what one normally gets as part of the stay as it featured delicious bagels, muffins, fruit, fresh juices, good coffee, etc. The rooms were quieter than some of the pricier locations on the beach, as the place has almost a condo feel to it, albeit one in which the guests are relatively quiet. There is a nice little pool for taking a swim, and a fine dining restaurant on the premises. The grounds are also scenic in their own right, and a walk around them gave one a glimpse of nature as there is a stream and an array of fish and birds to see.

My wife was in charge of the wedding and I was in charge of the honeymoon. So, months before the wedding I began researching hotels on Maui. My parents had always stayed in Lahaina and recommended we do the same, but for some reason my search always ended up in Wailea. Hotel Wailea was a fantastic choice. For the price of a week stay, it cannot be beat. When you first arrive you are greeted with the most spectacular view of the ocean from their lobby. The staff was also extraordinary. From the receptionists to the valets, everyone was super friendly. We had a partial ocean view suite, which means we were on the first floor. The hotel is unique in that there are multiple buildings with each building having 4 suites, 2 on top 2 on bottom. The rooms were huge for just two people. You walk in and there is a little kitchenette (sink, stove top, mini fridge, NO microwave). We only used the kitchen for the fridge and dishes, which were cleaned by the housecleaners. No pots, so if you wanted to cook pasta or something I think you have to bring your own. Connected to the kitchen was a large family room with a pull out couch and flat screen TV on the wall. This room also led out to the lanai (ours overlooked a koi pond). Off the family room are sliding doors that lead into the bedroom. Huge Bed (super comfy), flat screen TV, wifi, iPod dock, very nice room. Connected to the room is the bathroom. While it is true that there is no door that closes off the shower/bath from the bedroom, my wife and I could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cared less. If you are staying with friends or other couples just close off the sliding door the room and you will have no issues. The bathtub was awesome! Huge and deep, perfect for two! The shower was also huge and spacious. The toilet is in its own separate area with a door. I cannot say enough about the staff. Every day we talked to the valets to ask where locals eat, which beaches they go to, and where are the best spots for snorkeling. (Eat at \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDa Kitchen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Kihei, about 7 minutes drive from hotel, huge portions and great food) We stopped at Costco right after we got off the plane and bought way too much stuff and ended up giving what was left to the valets. Also, if you want to go anywhere in Wailea use the shuttle! The shuttle is a Cadillac Escalade, so you know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice. Might as well use the shuttle even if you have a car because you are already paying for it with the resort fee. The grounds were immaculate! The pool was small but perfect for adults. If you have kids you might want to consider the grand wailea because there pool area is phenomenal. The hot tub area was very unique, very Japanese. They had soaking tubs and a waterfall and a hot tub. It was really nice and relaxing. Overall, our trip to the Hotel Wailea was awesome! Perfect way to start off our marriage.

We spent hours researching hotels and eventually settled on Hotel Wailea. (Last year our fall trip was to Greece and trip advisor was so helpful in selecting perfect accommodations, we felt the reviews were probably pretty accurate for Maui as well. If you ever visit Greece, I highly recommend Esperas in Santorini!) As everyone states, Hotel Wailea is quite a bargain compared to the other resorts in Wailea. The grounds are beautiful, the staff is friendly and most accommodating and the shuttle service is easy and quick. That said, our problems started with a room that was less than desirable. Our full ocean view was overlooking a pond. After calling the front desk it was eventually resolved, but we wasted an hour on something that should have been in order before arrival. (I even confirmed the room by email twice prior to arrival after reading a few negative reviews) Our new room had a wonderful view, but the view was the only thing I can brag on. The furniture was very outdated and the kitchen was really just a waste of space. The shower/bath was also a little awkward with no door or curtain. Luckily we didn't spend much time in the room, but I can assure you I would be disappointed if I was on my honeymoon and not a girl's trip. The other big let down about Hotel Wailea was the beach setup. We were so excited to spend a day at the beach so we took the shuttle to the drop off and began to look for someone with umbrellas. After much confusion we learned that our hotel's umbrellas and chairs were quite embarrassing. The chairs were absurdly uncomfortable and outdated and the umbrella made us stand out like a sore thumb. The standard issue beach towels were also very different than all of the other sun bathers surrounding us. We were given short white bath towels! To make matters worse, they kicked us out of our chairs at 3 p.m. sharp (note - this only applies to Hotel Wailea guests). Let's just say we didn't visit the beach again. I also must mention that the complimentary water they highlight is nothing more than a water cooler with small cups for self service by the umbrella kiosk. On the flip side, dinner at Capishe? was outstanding. Yoga by the pool was an unexpected treat and the front desk staff was extremely helpful. Breakfast was just average - you'll be sick of carbs by day five! We also enjoyed meeting several other guests around the pool. Looking back I would prefer to spend a little more to stay at a different resort and enjoy the beach and updated room accommodations.

They even have toasters to toast your bagels with. This is an upgrade to what they had last year (and we loved their spread last year).

Check In - Simple and efficient. Cool cloths and cold water at the check-in counter after a day of travel was a welcome surprise. Counter staff were very friendly and confirmed they had placed us in a room that would meet our needs. The check in area is a beautiful open air building and is really spectacular. Room - We requested a room on the 2nd floor to obtain the best views and were provided this. We also asked for a newly renovated room and were provided this. Rooms are a good size (about 900 sq feet) and has a separate bedroom area. Living room has a couch, a small table to eat at, and a small kitchen area with sink, fridge, and 2 burner stove. Nice size balcony that fits a couple lounge chairs easily. Overall, room was good for the price. Biggest negative is that the rooms can feel a bit dirty and grungy in some areas. We had to keep our flip flops on most times as our feet would get dirty easily. Rooms could do with a major cleaning effort and overhaul to remove some of the grunge. They just feel a bit old and dated. Grounds - The grounds of this hotel are very nice. You feel secluded and there are lots of little out of the way areas to explore. It almost feels more like a condo development that also has hotel amenities. We did a grounds tour with a couple staff members and together we picked a variety of fruit right from the trees. They cleaned them for us and later we found a nice basket waiting for us in our room with starfruit, spanish mangos, lemons and sunkists. What other hotel can you do this at in Maui? Amenities - The pool is small, but very nice with a variety of loungers, chairs, and beds surrounding it. We went to the pool every day and had no problems finding space. Only complaint is that there is not always service available for drinks as it is dependent on # of guests. But it is easy enough to bring your own beverages to the pool. The spa is also very neat and is apparently a japanese style spa. I know there have been some complaints with it, but we found it to be very relaxing. We would go there either every morning or evening and relax in the soaker pools, hot tub, waterfall room or sauna. No extra charge to use and we missed this luxury during the remainder of our stay at other hotels. We shuttled to the beach one day, but found the exercise a bit strained. Umbrellas are limited and the chairs feel very dated. But at least you have the option for beach access. Breakfast - The hotel provides a simple continental breakfast as part of the room charge. Coffee, juice, bagels, pastries, and fruit. Again, I know that some people have complained there is not enough food variety and that food can run out later in the morning. We found the variety adequate and had no issues. During our stay at the Westin later in our trip we were entitled to a big american style breakfast buffet each morning and found we missed the simplicity of the Hotel Wailea offering. Restaurant - We ate one evening at Capische and enjoyed the meal. Yes it is a bit pricey, but it is a somewhat fine dining experience. The risotto and gnocci appetizers are excellent. Ask the server what they recommend for entree and they will also steer you in the direction of what is best at the moment. CONCLUSION - We will definitely go back to the Hotel Wailea. We found it to be a nice option between a big beachfront resort and your typical condo complex. * Check out my reviews I will be doing of the Fairmont Kea Lani and Westin Resort for comparatives.", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Stay at Hotel Wailea.

The hotel suite we stayed in was very clean and comfortable. It was a large suite with a living room, mini kitchenette and large walk in shower. There is a coin-operated laundry service for $2 per each machine. The hotel grounds are beautiful and peaceful. Because the hotel is nestled up in the hills, the view was spectacular. We had the opportunity to watch the sunset every night from our lanai and deck chairs. We emailed the hotel in advance to tell them we would be arriving later in the evening and asked for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kitchen set\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to be delivered to our room. The set consists of extra plates and pots, plans, knives, cutting board, and glasses. Since the kitchenette is normally equipped with just a few plates and glasses, this was a good tip that we learned by communicating with a fellow Trip Advisor contributor. The hotel promptly wrote back and said everything would be ready. Upon arrival we received water and cold towels which was a nice touch. There is a $20 a night resort fee for several services including parking, morning coffee and pastries, wi-fi, fitness center, business center (has a printer for your boarding pass), yoga sessions twice a week, and a shuttle that will take you anywhere within Wailea. We choose to use the shuttle to take us to dinner spots and to take us down to the beach every morning. The beaches are not connected, so you cannot walk continuously along the beach, however, the paved walking path was a great way to see the scenery and get in a walk. We started at Polo Beach (access near the Fairmount Hotel) and walked down toward the hotels and shops \u00e2\u20ac\u201c about a mile. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beach towels and chairs are located at the beach at the Grand Wailea Hotel, where you can also eat in their restaurants and charge to your room. There is a beach-side stand next to the Grand Wailea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beach services cart to accommodate you. We did not know until we go there, but there are two restaurants at the hotel. Capische and Il Teatro at Capische. If we had understood that better we would have made reservations at both places. However our meal at Capische was the best meal we had on Maui. They catch their own fish every day, make their own pastas and ice creams and offer a wonderful view of the ocean and sunset, or have tables in their garden area. We made reservations in advance of our trip by using OpenTable since we learned it is a popular place and can be hard to get in on short notice. We used the hotel site to book the room and because we booked in advanced, the price on their site was better than any other Internet price. The staff went out of their way to assist us and to ensure we had a great stay.

We spent so much time beforehand researching which hotel to stay in, and after seeing all the others we were very pleased with our choice-(Well, our first choice would have been the four seasons but our budget didn't quite reach!) This hotel is truly a hidden little gem. No one seems to have heard of it, and up until a year ago it was a japanese only resort. There are Japanese traits everywhere-beautiful japanese gardens and waterfalls. But very small showers and strange bathrooms layouts. This hotel is slowly undergoing significant changes, and i give it two years before it's much more advertised and busy. We were told it was at 100% capacity and most days we had the entire pool to ourselves! This is definitely not a place for children. In fact, they should officially make it an adults only resort because there only seemed to be couples there, and there was one family with kids who i heard changed hotel as the children were so bored. This hotl is all about the peace and quiet and that's what makes it so amazing. We walked past the hotels down on the beach and they were so noisy in contrast. The Grand Wailea looked like a circus! Kids swinging from ropes and the pool smelt of urine-awful. Going back to Hotel Wailea was serenity. The breakfast was OK, but only OK. It could have been so much better and they don't need to do much to improve it. A bit more choice of fruit would have been nice, and they'd often run out of jam or juice at 8am- breakfast is 7-9am so it's not very hard to make sure they have enough supplies. The bagels and muffins were lovely but sometimes a choice of cereal or something a little lighter on the stomach wouldn't go amiss. The rooms were really big! It's your own little apartment which is perfect if you want to store drinks/food in the fridge or eat in some nights. They are crying out for a makeover, but i did hear that they will all be updated in the near future. Again, if they just re-carpet and re-upholster the furniture then they'll look brand new! The beds are super comfy. The free shuttle down to the beach is fantastic- not a shuttle at all, a lovely escalade! And the boys who dop you off and pick you up are fab- look out for Max he's just brilliant, as they all are (and they tell you the shuttle finishes at 10pm but the boys said they'd still collect you up until 2am!) It's only a 3 minute car ride to the beach/shops or 20 min hilly walk. We didn't get round to eating in Capishe? as we didn't like the look of the menu- but it's a big deal in Wailea. Apparently Adam Sandler was eating there a couple of months previously! And it has a killer view. The hotel offers free wifi and parking too! All in all we had a lovely relaxing holiday here and if it stays the secret it seems to be then we'll definitely go back!", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport, South Wales", "Title": "\u201cSome great points - Some poor points.\u201d", "Author": "CocoSianElle", "ReviewID": "UR81645810", "Content": "My husband and I were booked at this hotel for the last part of our honeymoon via a company we used for a multi centre honeymoon. I will start by saying that the location and grounds of the hotel are lovely. However their are a few things that are letting this hotel down. When my husband and I arrived we were shown to reception whilst our bags were loaded onto a trolley. The receptionist took our details and advised us that we would need to pay a resort fee. This was something that we were unaware of so questioned it, however we were advised it must be paid. After a long day of travelling I didn't really want to stand around and argue so we paid up. Now my issue with paying the resort fee is that the hotel sells itself on offering so many of is services 'free' or complimentary but I cannot see how when you are paying $20 for these 'luxuries'. The 'fee' included breakfast which you have to get there early enough to take advantage of. I agree with other comments made that their is not enough variety and it would be nice to see more yoghurts and fruits (we only had yoghurt on 1 day out of 7). My other issue with the breakfast set up is because a local company supply it, they bring in their own staff and one of them was rude to me on one of our last days. My husband and I arrived for breakfast at 9am (it closes 9:30) and their was only 1 bagel left and a hand full of pastries. I questioned the man serving and his response was \"Well breakfast closes at 9:30\" to which we replied that it was only 9 and was told they bring so much food and when it's gone that's it. So because all the food had gone, we had to miss out on something that we were paying $20 per day for! I then went to get a drink of water and found that their was none there. I asked where the water was and was told that he had already cleared it away. I asked him politely if he could return it as breakfast was still open for another half an hour. Whilst he was clearing up my husband and I had to make do with the left overs. I returned 5 minutes later to find no water. I did complain at reception and our resort fee was reduced for that day. This hotel either needs to restrict people to what they can have, order more food or simply just serve their own breakfast. Another perk of the fee is the use of the beach area at the Grand Wailea. Our first full day this was where we headed. We were taken down in the luxurious shuttle transport and was told to walk around the sea front. So we did this and arrived at the pool for Grand Wailea with the beach just in front of it. We spent a few minutes looking to see if there were any spare loungers on the beach but there were not. Just as we were about to lay our towels on the sand we noticed some hotel staff bringing loungers out for people so followed them back to find a stall with people queuing up for loungers and towels. When we got the the front of the queue we advised we were staying in the Hotel Wailea and was told we would need to go to the stall next door (which was actually renting scuba gear?!?). So anyway, told them we needed two loungers and two towels - We were advised to go to the beach and pick our spot and they would bring the loungers down. Now all of the other loungers were as you would expect - fabric to lay on, steel frame and the top and bottom areas adjust so you can lay dow, sit up, etc and a nice cream parasol. The 'loungers' that were brought out for us looked like something from the 50's. They were more like deck chairs as they had a wooden frame, dirty multi coloured fabric and the part you would put your feet on was a completely separate piece that had to be hooked on, also our parasols were blue and obviously very old. This was the one and only time we went to the beach as we both felt embarrassed as it was like we were singled out as staying in the 'poorer' hotel as the old and dirty equipment really made us stick out. Because of this we spent the rest of our holiday next to the pool. One good part of the fee is the spa and seemed to be a hidden gem. We were told about it when we booked in but it is not sign posted and is out of the way. But it really is beautiful and spotless. My husband would go in here for an hour or so everyday and there is always drinking water and cleaning products readily available which is obviously restocked numerous times through the day. The next thing is the rooms, I'll start by saying the bed is probably the most comfortable I've slept in for ages. Also the bath/shower room is an odd set up but because it was only my husband and I were staying we didn't mind it at all. Was always clean and in a bathroom that is important. The rooms do however require some updating, new carpets, sofa ect. The kitchen does seem a bit pointless as you haven't got any utensils (knifes, forks or pans) to use in it. On the website it states if you are a honeymoon couple you get some extra goodies - we did not receive any of these. I think in a year or so this hotel could potentially be superb but they definitely need some improvements. The grounds are beautiful with fresh flowers every morning, the spa is lovely and the pool is nice but we did have some let downs.", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plano, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel with outstanding service!\u201d", "Author": "Leki", "ReviewID": "UR81138640", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from a week's stay at this property.

It was a beautiful, restful retreat. The staff are amazingly friendly and helpful, especially Emily at the front desk. The only issue we incurred during our stay was when we first checked in we were given a room that did not have the panoramic ocean view we booked that we were expecting from the pictures on the website. We were told there were no more rooms like that until the next day, so we stayed in that room for one night, and then they moved us to a better view room the next day which was a little inconvenient, but not a huge deal. Also, I want to mention that the first room had stains on the carpets, and the couch in the living room was disgusting with large, HORRIBLE looking stains. There was an ocean view, but in my opinion it was not \"panoramic\". The second room had a much better view, newer carpet and only minimal stains on the couch. The couches are white so perhaps they have been cleaned but the stains are not removable. Be sure you ask for a room that has had the carpet upgraded and the couch is clean. If you want to really cook, do not be fooled by the kitchenette they advertise. One other negative thing I will mention is that the cooking equipment is minimal. We ordered a \"cooking set\" ahead of time as my travel agent recommended. This only included one very large pot and a very small skillet. No measuring cups, spoons, strainer, etc. The beach in Wailea is very nice, but crowded so it was wonderful to come back to the Hotel to the peace and quiet in the afternoon and watch the sun set from our lanai.

To begin with, we stayed at the Four Seasons directly beforehand and probably were just a bit tainted by the experience, but the deficiencies at Hotel Wailea were so obviously weird, our stay just left us with questions about how the management spends their money and efforts! Cons: - Carpet had HUGE stains EVERYWHERE. We're not talking about the occasional \"went hiking and walked a bit on the carpet.\" These were black-holes of stains all over the place... why wouldn't they change this? When we complained at front desk and asked if we could at least have a pair of slippers (they do have a fully operational spa ... I'm sure slippers could be arranged), they told us they had none but would wash our carpets to make sure they're clean. We decided against this ... it wasn't dirty; it was just old. - The furniture in the place is at least 20 years old. This would have been killer in the 80's, but time for a major facelift. - The bathroom was the weirdest setup ever. This bathtub had a shower stall (with the dirtiest tiles that had paint and caulking bits coming off from the force of the water) directly beside it, then a little hallway leading to the rest of the bathroom, but no curtain in sight. No idea how this is manageable to the general public... - On our last night, a little cockroach fell out of the lampshade. I know we're in a tropical country, but in another resort we stayed at they had a small can of RAID to help with such situations. Pros: - The grounds were beautiful ... they must have some of the best gardeners in the area, because they do beautiful things with their flowers and make a nice little community of waterfalls and bridges on the grounds - But ... forgive me for putting a con in the pro section, but I'm just seething here ... the very fact that the grounds were so immaculate was even more of a turn-off that they couldn't do anything more with the rooms; changing a carpet would have cost a fraction of what they probably do every day on those lawns - Capische is a nice restaurant on their property. Granted, we didn't really love our meal at all, especially for what we paid<!>, but this may have been just what we ordered Overall, the place was really unclean, and out of date inside. As a place for a honeymoon couple, I'd really recommend against this if you have other options. There are just so many beautiful hotels nearby that with some savvy Hotwire searching you can find others. Especially for a honeymoon, you most want a comfortable place that you can come home to, and have a romantic intimate way to unwind. The grossness of the room pretty much killed that buzz right away.

It will cost you less, and you will get the entire Maui spa experience equal to none versus the dark small massage room of the deserted spa at Hotel Wailea, which is surprsingly more expensive than the Spa Grande.

We stayed in a second level room, and our view from the balcony was perfect because we had a panoramic view of the ocean. We could see the neighboring Hawaiian islands, and each evening we watched the dramatic sunset. The view form the balcony also included a large pond with coy fish (the pond is located just outside of the building and from the balcony you look down directly at the pond) and we could see the large, upscale homes across the street from the hotel complex. However, not all rooms have this view. We really enjoyed our view and spent much time in the late afternoon and evening on the balcony. To the left of our balcony, we had a nice garden view with trees and flowering shrubs/landscaping. The neighboring room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balcony was directly to our right, but fortunately the room was not occupied, so we had privacy when we sat outside. We would not have been happy with neighboring balconies on both sides of our room, which is the layout for most rooms at the hotel. The room was large, but the overall d\u00c3\u00a9cor is dated. At first we were disappointed with the d\u00c3\u00a9cor, but then we did not mind much after we saw what a great view we had! The room was partly renovated with a new stone floor in the entrance area and the walls were freshly painted and we had new bedding. It seems as though the remainder of the renovation is due soon. The kitchen area includes a small sink and a refrigerator, which was great to have. The lobby area is very nice and also had a great view of Maui, the other islands, and the ocean. We went to the Friday evening manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reception and stayed for happy hour, which was a nice evening. The continental breakfast is also held in the lobby area and it included bagels, muffins, fresh fruit, coffee, and juice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were pleased with it for being a contenential breakfast. The pool area is also very nice and has a contemporary feel to it with new, modern patio/pool side furniture, and the pool bar recently opened and only serves soda, juice, and beer. We enjoyed the pool after a long day at the beach! The hotel restaurant, Capische, is completely overrated. However, we do live in a large city and have access to best restaurants as we please, so perhaps this is why we were not overly impressed with the restaurant. We sat in the bar area one evening and watched as the server and bartender attempted to exhaust a flamb\u00c3\u00a9 dessert that was accidently set on fire \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they really need to be careful during the flamb\u00c3\u00a9 process to ensure that it done correctly and not to set desserts totally ablaze!! Regarding beaches, the hotel is located a short drive away from many smaller beaches in Wailea, which is great if you enjoy going to a new beach each day. We only went to Wailea Beach on one day, but we did not like how crowded it was \u00e2\u20ac\u201c several large resorts are located there and therefore it is a very busy beach area. We did use the complementary beach chairs and umbrella, and these were great to have access to since it is hot in the sun. But, if you do not like large, busy beaches, be sure to drive to the smaller ones in the area.

Basically a large, very hot, hot tub, 1 working shower, a very very hot sauna! And a rain type shower. It seemed as though they were renovating this when we were there, but definately needs the update. - Breakfast. This has to be sorted out. It is served in the lobby, its not really an appropriate space to eat, not enough chairs and tables. We would suggest moving it to either the restaurants or downstairs there seemed to be deserted function room of a perfect size. The breakfast itself is out on a table with zero presentation.

We had read the many reviews and were prepared in advance that it wasn't on the beach, that the pool was small, etc. etc. I was actually questionning some of the reviews for this place and wondered if they were....ummm...fake (they aren't). The staff were great and I can best describe the whole atmosphere there as laid back and chill. For example, in the mornings I would drive my car up to the valet turnaround while we ate breakfast and just leave it there. The valet guys would say: \"no problem. Take as long as you like.\" Contrast that with the Grand Wailea valet parking zoo/circus, and you'll understand what I mean :) Grounds: Beautiful. Many posters talked about the flowers everywhere, and we watched a man cut flowers from the grounds and place them ALL over the hotel each day. We saw the same man sweep them all up at the end of the day and start all over again the next day. We loved walking with the kids on the paths and stopping to play croquet or bocci ball. The kids also loved feeding the KOI each day. Breakfast: Catered by Honoulu Coffee Company. Breakfast was fine. Decent scones, bagels, etc. and POG. It wouldn't hurt them to throw a papaya in once in a while, but whatever. If you tried to feed your family of four at the actual Honolulu Coffee Company store at the Shops in Wailea, it would easly be $20-30 per day. Other Food: We didn't eat in the fancy restaurant. They now offer poolside and room service picnic items which I thought was a good idea, though we didn't take advantage. Sodas were a dollar at the pool. A dollar. Nothing costs a dollar on Maui. Give points to HW for listening to their customers and offering new services. Pool: It's fine. it's wet and clean. The benefits, especially after visiting Grand Wailea, is the calm and peace in the pool area, even with kids. Our kids had a great time in that pool, and we loved that fact that we could hang out in a sheltered day bed for FREE. We felt like we had the place to ourselves, even though we didn't. Spa: Quirky little spa that was cool. It's now coed and despite rumors, bathing suits are required. Sitting in the large hot tub and looking out over the ocean. Nice work if you can get it. While we were there, they were rebuilding the gym area, and according to Hotel Wailea Facebook they had just opened it...only they didn't...cause we were THERE, and trust me it was NOT open. A little advance marketing is ok, though we were laughing at the time reading the post. Room: We had panoramic ocean view room and it was great. We used the little kitchen and had no issues. The bathroom is big, but my only complaint is that it's open to the bedroom and offers little privacy for a family of four trying to share. Our view was gorgeous. We'd watch the sunset every night and almost NEVER saw another person on a balcony. We loved that feeling of peace and quiet after exploring the Island all day. Overall: I think under current management this hotel is really trying hard to please its guests. We had very little to complain about and thought it was a great base of operations. We surprised the kids with a one night visit to the Grand Wailea in the middle of our stay, and after two days of \"Vegas on Maui,\" were were quite happy to return to the serenity of HW. Suggestions: 1. Get some fruit for breakfast. It's Hawaii for cryin' out loud 2. Finish the gym (ok...check) 3. Don't promote your hotel too much. We like the balance of you staying in business but being a hidden gem (selfish much?) 4. Keep your rates reasonable (we'd like to come back) 5. Keep doing what you are doing Tips to travelers: 1. READ the reviews. It's not on the beach. If you want on the beach, go elsewhere :) 2. See breakfast notes above. If you want bacon and eggs, cook your own or head down the hill. There are plenty of places willing to take your $$$ 3. Take advantage of the \"chill\" attitude. One night my wife and I went up to the spa in our hotel provided robes, and then we marched straight up to the lobby for a drink. They were happy to see us and even though they were closing the bar, they stayed open just because we were wearing our robes :) Too fun.

The staff is friendly and helpful, our suite was spacious and airy and had a fantastic view. The price of the hotel is great in comparison to others in the area. But the hotel is not for everyone, and we would hesitate to recommend it to some people we know. If the hotel is for you, stay there. If it isn't, then think twice. The Location The hotel is up the hill from the ocean, so if you like having the convenience of being on the beach, the place is not for you. They do offer transportation service to the Wailea beach and elsewhere in Wailea, however. The valet/transport staff were very friendly. You can walk downhill to the beach in about 15-20 minutes, but it is steep, and coming back up will take much longer and I would only recommend it if you are in shape. Not what you would want to do if you have beach stuff with you. There are also public parking areas at a couple of the public access areas to the beaches, so if you have a rental car, this is a good option. The Suite The suite was large. We had two beds and one sofa bed which made this practical for us and our two older teens. The sofabed mattress was not great, but this is not surprising. The bathroom is odd: It was practical having a separate toilet and a separate sink area. But the shower/tub area is connected to the bedroom and there is no door. This was a bit inconvenient traveling with the older kids. There is a nice small kitchen area with a fridge and a few plates, glasses, and forks, etc. Though there is a two burner stove, there are no cooking utensils, so unless you bring your own, it is not so useful. (We managed to use it to heat up some leftover pizza wrapped in foil.) There is no microwave. There is a nice patio looking out over the ocean. Unfortunately, our unit was close to the road, and it was annoying to be in such an otherwise tranquil place and to hear the locals (I presume) driving by early in the morning. This was one blemish to the suite experience. The Hotel There is a nice balcony area where continental breakfast is served from 7:30 to 9:30. There is an excellent choice of bagels, scones, muffins, breads as well as yogurt and whole fruit, coffee and tee. We found that the some of the items ran out before the breakfast ended at 9:30. The balcony area turns into a lounge in the evening with nice live music. We did not try the restaurant at the hotel. This is not a resort, and most people seem to use the hotel as a base, leaving for the day at the beaches or for exploring the island. The nice pool area was very quiet all the time. There is a small kiddie pool that I never saw used. If you wanted a small pool for toddlers and a tranquil environment to relax around, this would be a nice place, as long as being at the ocean is not a priority. Kids older than toddler age would probably go crazy with the lack of activities. There is also a Spa area open from noon to 10pm. The area includes showers, sauna, jacuzzi, soaking pool, etc. This area seems to be undergoing some renovations, but it was open.

We had the luxury condo which had the absoloutly beautiful panoramic view over the ocean. We had the Ocean view originally which would have been on a slightly lower level but we're surprised to find we had been upgraded which was great! We ventured to the cafe Capiche which is very overpriced but you will be gaurenteed out standing food and service and if you order one entree between two and an apertizer that can keep the cost down. We had the Lobster and seafood special and the risotto which was very tasty. We also got a complimentary 20% discount for staying at the hotel too which also brought the price down. We did have a one night splurge there and it was worth every penny. One major thing we noticed dure in our stay was how quiet it was. It seemes most people don't venture to the spa or know it's there but my wife and I went every evening and we only saw another soul in it once or twice.

The room does need some spiffing up of details related to age but nothing really detracts from enjoying the facility.

Ayumi at the front desk, and Manny, and Max out front were simply amazing!

Rooms need some minor \"refreshing\"....my suggestion to management was to either trash the carpeting and tile the floors, or get new carpeting...looks like they are preparing to do just that. Its not that the rooms are in bad shape, but a stain on the carpet in one room, or some thread fringe on a carpet in another, were visible, and I could assuredly see how some folks might not rate them as highly as others (self included). I have said this to the many folks who reached out to me last year, and will say it agin to anyone else who wants more info: This is NOT the Kea Lani. Its not all marble and granite; not trendy and flashy, not beachfront. Its also NOT $450 a night for a decent room there. We had a great deal by dealing directly with the resort and paying 60 days in advance, and shaved off a little more than $300 per night from what we paid at the Kea Lani.

We wanted to get off the beaten path and get as far away from the glitzy hustle and bustle of Wailea Town. It's only a 3 minute drive from Wailea Beach (where Hotel Wailea guests can get free beach service, umbrellas, towels, etc), but its location situates it perfectly slightly up the hill and away from the tourist traps below. The views are spectacular. Our room had a panoramic view of 3 islands (Kaho'olawe, Lanai, Molokai). All rooms are suites and all appear to have equally beautiful and private sweeping views of the garden grounds and the ocean and neighbor islands. The rooms are laid out such that you aren't aware of your neighbors and nobody can see into your room--all you see is garden and ocean. The Japanese-style Onsen (Furo) was the highlight. This is a big coed hot spring-type spa with all kinds of relaxing water treatments. Of course this is at no charge. There's also a mini-furo in the suite itself, but the spa was uncrowded and we used it a couple times each day. Outside on the pool deck, we relaxed in what can only be described as 4-post beds with sofa cushions and awnings. On the pool deck! These provide ample sun protection and are comfy enough to chill out in all day, while viewing the neighboring islands and the garden grounds. The pool is heated, too. Of course, drink service is available by the pool and drinks here are remarkably well priced (couple bucks for a beer--not like how the big resorts usually rip you off at the pool bar). Other on-property amenities include hammocks, little hiking and walking trails, and a free shuttle to and from the beach. The Concierge was well-trained and well connected and helped us make reservations for fun things to do around the island. We had our big night out at Capiche, the on-property restaurant. It was a 1 minute walk from our room (and the spa) which was good since we drank a bunch of their amazing wine over a leisurely dinner. The food was unequivocally out of this world. Italian cuisine taken to a new level, with classy service, an impressive wine list, and a waiter who knew lots about the food and the wine. We mostly had what the waiter recommended and it was all most excellent. We were full after 3 appetizers and one entree. Free breakfast each morning consists of pasteries, fruit, fresh coffee and juice. Having breakfast provided takes a lot of the frustration out of travel and helped us get on with our day without wasting time figuring out what to eat in the morning. Overall, this has been one of our favorite trips and our new favorite destination on Maui. Word is it's a happening place during the Wailea Film Festival. We can't wait to come back.

I was so overwhelmed by the different hotels and variations that I finally just settled for the hotel that had the most consistent reviews within my price range. I can't even begin to explain how lucky that was. 1. The Room: We had booked a \"partial ocean view\" room. The hotel is situated in 4 room villas, the top 2 rooms had the ocean view where the bottom 2 had a view of the gardens (more on that later). The view we had from the lenai was incredible. Because the hotel sits up on the volcano a bit, we were able to see almost the entire coast of the island. The beautiful ocean was bookended by two mountains. I can't imagine what the view would be like from an ocean view room. What a beautiful way to wake up. The room itself was pretty sizable for just the two of us. We had a small kitchenette, a table, sitting area with the door to the lenai in the one room. And then it opened up to a master bedroom, an open shower/tub area and a bathroom. The room was very clean. A lot of the reviews of this place talked about the furniture being outdated. The couch could benefit from some reupholstering.. but then again, so could mine at home. 2. The grounds were amazing. Everytime I walked around the place I caught myself admiring the meticulously cared for gardens and scenic design. The lobby area was the perfect spot for the continental breakfast that was served fresh daily. The pool and spa were also impeccable. 3. The staff was friendly and helpful. Everyone seemed to genuinely enjoy working for this hotel and helping us out when needed. Hotel Wailea only has 72 rooms and provides a very intimate atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this for couples who are looking for a quite/relaxing trip. There were very few families - so no kids. We found this a huge plus.

The grounds are absolutely beautiful, the pool area is stylish and comfortable and the spa has a huge stone soaking pool that is as large as a small swimming pool and slightly cooler than a standard hot tub. It is open to the outside on one side with a great view of the sun setting into the ocean. (They really should market this point - it's gorgeous.) Our little boy actually enjoyed the tub a great deal. There was also a 'baby pool' by the main pool that he enjoyed dabbling in. People have mentioned it is not suitable for children, but I saw at least half a dozen other families with children while I was there. The room was large, clean and comfortable. Very private and quiet. The kitchenette was a bit sparse but functional, the huge bath tub was very relaxing and the bed and bed linens were actually quite excellent. The maids washed our soiled dishes for us every day. We booked the garden view and got a free upgrade to a partial ocean view and were very happy with it. The lanai overlooked one of the koi ponds and our baby enjoyed feeding the birds that hung out near the pond. Negatives - There was a coffee stain on the carpet and the lighting in the bathroom and at the spa were dim and a bit outdated. There was a temperature control knob missing off one of the hotplate burners. The breakfast was basic but fresh - bagels and baked good, coffee and juice. We recieved good service from the staff whenever we dealth with them. We dined at Capiche, the restaurent, for dinner one evening. Fine italian dining with an incredible sunset view. The beef carpaccio and the truffle risotto were delectable. I picked up a cheap cooking pot locally and we cooked in for at least one meal a day. Apparently pots are available from the hotel for a modest rental fee.The resort should really should consider providing a pot free with the dishes in the kitchenette. It's an annoying point that everyone picks up on that surely wouldn't be a huge expense for them to accomodate. The major drawback to this resort, is that it is not on the beach and it is a bit on the quirky side with it's somewhat austere japanese styling. (The baths are now co-ed and non-nude, by the way.)

I brought a sharp knife from home to cut the apple with, as well as to cut up other fruit we picked up from roadside stands that included pineapple (fabulous!), mango and papaya with lime. The hotel provides shampoo, conditioner and soap from Aveda. Towels were plentiful in the rooms, by the pool, and at the beach. The beach chair, umbrella, and towels were a huge benefit! They were comfortable and we loved having this amenity. We found it confusing at first. You need to follow the paved path from the Wailea Beach public entrance to the Grand Wailea. Continue down the path until about 1/2 past the pools and you'll see 2 stands for water activities. They can help you there. You can have the hotel take you and pick you up at the Wailea Beach public access - just remember to bring a phone and their number to call them. We used the Hotel to start, but then found it a bit more convenient for us to drive. We loved driving on the island in our Jeep, so driving up and down the hill to the hotel was fun for us. We also kept our snorkeling gear in the car and found a good snorkling spot to the south of Wailea Beach. The hotel is very quiet. We never heard or saw our neighbors in the 4 unit building. The beach however was littered with kids on Spring Break. We drove down past Kihei 1 day to enjoy time on a quiet beach. You will also find quieter beaches south near the Fairmont.

I would not recommend the hotel for people who don't get around well. We did not cook anything (no microwave in the room), but found very reasonably priced and convenient places to eat. We'd recommend WokStar, Cafe Kiehi for breakfast, and Pupu Lounge Seafood & Grill - go before 6pm for happy hour drink specials ($2 large Mai Tais and dollar off beers) and get the fish and chips - ask for the organic side salad and get the fish grilled. The tempura fish was good as well, but the grilled was more flavorful and healthier. There is a small refrigerator where we stored drinks. It didn't feel cold enough to store milk in. The ice machine is up by the pool. We got plenty of beach time and so not staying on the beach was not a problem. We did a lot of driving to other towns, hiking spots, including a 12 hour trip to and from Hana. We went to Lahaina for the Old Lahaina Luau which I would highly recommend. Where else would I like to stay? Maybe next time at the Fairmont or Four Seasons if we could afford that, a condo in Kehei would also suit us nicely. I'm not familiar with the other parts of the island to make any determination.

Yes, they aren't all modern and refurbished but the current owners only took over a year ago. The gardens are immaculate and there are amazing ocean and sunset views from the lobby/restaurant and spa. Staff-extremely helpful, the shuttle guys are great. Always picked us up within 5minutes and even came out at midnight to fetch us from the shops! The spa and pool area are heaven after a long day driving/walking. You can buy a $1 bag of fish food from reception to feed the lovely koi carp. Improvements: They could do with a hotel brochure in the room. There is no information about opening times etc so we had to ask all the time. The restaurant, although nice enough food was way overpriced and closed at 8:45! There is nowhere to buy snacks or a shop on site. There a $1 soft drinks in a barrel by the pool until 4pm daily. We, a young British couple, thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would definately return.

The grounds were beautiful, the staff was extremely gracious, helpful, and friendly. My room was clean, spacious, and comfortable. I agree that I wouldn't consider them having a 'kitchen'-there was no microwave, and I had little use for the 'hot plate' like burners that were in the rooms. There were no utensils, pots, pans, etc to make use of anyway. However, the restaurants on the island were so good, I don't know why you would want to cook anyway (I would have liked a microwave to warm up my leftovers, though). The breakfast consisted of only pastries, no protein but I luckily packed protein bars after reading the previous reviews. The gym was closed and the 'business center' consisted of only one computer (and they were thinking of charging for its use in the future). The spectacular views from my lanai, the gorgeous grounds, and the ultra relaxing, quiet environment was really all I wanted and well worth the price I paid (including getting 2 nights free for paying for 8). I visited several resorts while in Maui and was so pleased that I chose Hotel Wailea instead of a busy, crowded, tacky beach 'resort' that was full of loud tourists. I will only pick the Hotel Wailea for my future stays and can't wait to take my boyfriend on my next trip to Maui--the boutique resort is perfect for couples-extremely relaxing and romantic. I recommend a rental car (and you'll need one anyway for the drive from the airport).

The rooms could use a bit of TLC (there was a small rip in the couch), but we didn't care because we didn't spend much time in our room. They were clean and comfortable (the bed was incredibly comfortable!) and had everything we needed. We had no stains on our carpets and never encountered a cockroach. We got an oceanview room which had a wonderful lanai and we were able to watch whales spouting and breaching right from our room. The washroom was large and comfortable, with a huge shower/bathtub area and a separate toilet. Breakfast is included and is basically what others have written: bagels, muffins, scones, banana bread, a bit of fruit, tea, coffee and delicious passion-orange-guava juice. Personally, we are cereal people, so we just bought a box and some milk at the local supermarket (go to Foodland in Kihei and get a savings card) and supplemented it with some of the pastries, tea, coffee and juice provided by the hotel. We grabbed the tray that is in the kitchen under the coffee maker and brought it up to the lobby everyday to get our breakfast and then ate on our lanai overlooking the ocean. You really can't get much better than that! As for the location, we thought it was perfect. It is not on the beach, but whenever we wanted to go to the beach, one of the staff was there promptly to take us (in a Cadillac Escalade, none the less), and picked us up right when we asked. You can get beach chairs and umbrellas from the Grand Wailea, which we never had a problem with. And after going up to the north and seeing the hotels at Kaanapali and Kapalua, we still felt that Wailea was the best place to stay. We would agree with some of the other people who have posted reviews that it would be nice to have a casual snack/lunch place to grab food at. But we were rarely around the hotel for lunch since there is so much to see on Maui, that it didn't really effect us. And there are tons of options in Kihei or at the beachfront hotels in Wailea to choose from. The hotel was pretty quiet, which we loved, but if you are looking for action, this is probably not the place for you. There is no bar/nightclub, and we found guests pretty much kept to themselves.

We literally felt like we stepped onto the set of The Golden Girls, and I expected Bea Arthur to pop out of the lanai wearing a hawaiian shirt and sipping a glass of Ovaltine. The carpeting was stained-not just a couple of stains here and there-but huge brown stains that resembled a blowout from a baby's diaper. The couch was at least 30 years old, with yellow spots. They tried to make it look better with some new throw pillows, but as the saying goes, \"you can't polish a turd.\" I looked in horror at the bed and noticed a dark spot that was MOVING under the duvet cover. Yes, it was a cockroach, and that does not include the one my husband stepped on in the kitchen while he was barefoot. Oh yeah, kitchen it is not. There was one plate and two scary burners with white residue on them. Yes, I love to cook and was planning on making meals, but no, I do not want to get swine flu or warts from this process. Next let's talk about the \"spa.\" The water looked so inviting until we both stepped in and it literally scalded our feet and legs, hence our nickname for the remainder of our trip \"red pants.\" The only good feature was a water pipe that slammed water onto our backs like a weird massage. When we asked about the burning water, which several other guests also complained about, they told us it was \"standard temperature.\" I guess \"standard\" means fire of hell in Maui. But doesn't the room come with breakfast, you ask? Oh yes, it comes with bagels, muffins, pastries, and more carbs. No choices other than that.

I'm a little dubious of some of these reviews though, reading them now after we just checked out - some seem a little too good and off the mark. Here's our experience: Pros: - The location is spectactular. Too much of a premium is placed (in my opinion) on being *on* the beach. In most beach hotels, your room is far from - and it's a decent walk to a beach you want to be at. Being up on the hill, as HW is, you get an AMAZING view - you could enforce Federal laws on boats getting too close to whales from up there - a view I never had from the Kea Lani or Grand Wailea. The best beaches in South Maui you have to drive to regardless - Big beach, little beach, etc. Wailea beach is pretty weak, and Polo beach isn't exactly walking distance from anywhere other than the Kea Lani. The HW also offers a great shuttle service - never waited more than 10 mins for rides to any of the Wailea resorts or the mall. - Our room was great. It seems they have upgraded and non-upgraded rooms from aksing around - ours was upgraded, and it was perfect. Great balcony, two flat screens, little mini-kitchen, new carpets, nice bed, free internet. - The grounds were specactular - very well maintained. The Cons - This used to be the Diamond Walilea resort, a Japanese hotel aimed at Japanese visitors. In and of itself, no problems, but the spa is a traditional Japanese one - not the kind you might be used to. Much of the staff is native Japanese-speaking as well - requring some patience. Overall, no problems though. - The Pool is ice cold. Seriously - like they have to cool it to keep it that cold. The guy at teh front desk told us it was \"semi-heated\" - not sure what that means but I think I saw a polar bear swimming around in there. We love hanging around by the pool, but realized this trip that hanging around sucks if you can't get in the actual pool. - There is no real bar - they have a temporary set up on Fridays and Saturdays in the lobby, but it misses the mark and has no food. You also can't get a drink by the pool. (The pool attenednt, also the activities coordinator, told us that drinks would be availiable by the pool \"later\" - not sure when that meant...) - The restaurant Capiche?, has some great reviews, but we were never in the mood for Italian. Too bad that's the only restaurant - no pool fare, no lobby stuff - just that one restaurant. All in all, I'd reccomend this to a friend wanting to get a great bargain, who was OK sacrificing some of the hotel experience.

The rooms come with a \"kitchen\" but really the come with a small (hotel sized) refregerator and a cook top, but nothing to cook with or put food on.

The shower and bath are very nice and spacious also. You can see the Japanese influence in the bath area with the deep spa tub and the bidet toilets. \"Breakfast\" consists of bagels, scones and coffee and tea. If you want something more, you will have to travel to a restaurant or shop at the local Safeway (and check out the kitchen supplies) from the front desk. The shuttle to the beach was a nice feature, but they only have one cart and it needed recharging after a few trips, so they then used a very old and worn van that was held together with duct tape....another cart would be very helpful here. The spa was very nice, but we really didn't use it much. They have a large spa with a small waterfall, a steam room and a nice dressing room with all the needed necessaties.

When we first arrived and were looking for the hotel we became concerned since no one we asked knew about this hotel. When we found it we were in a pleasant surprise. Wailea is a beautiful area of Maui. This hotel reflects all the positive sides of Wailea: beauty, peace and perfection. We stayed in a room with an ocean view which was wonderful. We got to see the sunset every evening right from our room. The hotel is close enough to the beach yet not right on the beach where all the crowds are. The hotel offers shuttle services to the beach at Grand Wailea where you can get a place to sit and towels. As a guest you are allowed to charge to your hotel account for expenses at the Grand Wailea but are not allowed to make use of the pool.

The rooms had high speed wireless which was great to be able to use while sitting out on the balcony in the mornings or evenings. Another great feature was that there was always parking available and the daily resort fee ($20/day) wasn't outrageous like we found it to be in Oahu later on our trip. Plus, you get so much included for that $20 -parking, breakfast, high speed internet, beach transportation/amenities, etc. We didn't use the pool (went to the beach instead) but it looked like a very nice pool.

It had a very large tub and a large open shower. The shampoo products were Aveeno (love it). The kitchenette was a little small but I only used the sink.

You need to make sure to walk around the pathways after checking in. I didn't discover just how amazing they were until the day before I left. There was a stream with benches and walks along the side. And a little foot bridge that crossed the stream. I also noticed a banana tree with banana's on it. The front desk had a bowl of star fruit that they said were picked from a tree on the grounds. It is a quiet and private location but if you want activity the personnel are extrememly attentive and will give you a ride where ever you want to go in Wilea. I called for a ride to go to the Wilea shops and was picked up at my door in an electric cart and then taken up to the hotel van for the ride to the shopping center. When I called for pick up I was surprised at how fast they showed up. The hotel also has access to the beach in front of the Grand Wilea, where you can use their towels and chairs. They also give you a card so you can charge drinks, food, etc. to your hotel room. I didn't try it but bet it would be wonderful. I can't say enough nice things about the employees. I was treated well by every staff member I dealt with. And was greeted by name by many of the them. I was especially fond of the valets, who were particularly warm and friendly. In addition I would highly recommend eating at The Wok Star. It was a little hole in the wall place across the street from the beach in Kihea and was delicious.

The grounds are lovely and well taken care of, and the sweeping views are fabulous and can't be beat. There are two things you should know. One, the hotel isn't on the beach. Rather, they're a half-mile up the hill, which explains their amazing views. However, they have a speedy shuttle service that whisks you down to their own little section of Wailea Beach, and considering the size of some mega resorts, you may find you're at the beach quicker and with fewer steps than if you were paying a small fortune for that oceanfront location. Plus there are so many special beaches on Maui, and we wanted to visit them all, that we ended up driving to different beaches around the island anyway. Second, the rooms are a little tired.

As far as the room goes it was basically fine. There was a slight musty smell upon entering which disappeared as soon as the windows were opened and wasn't a problem the rest of the stay. The only thing that could be considered dirty was the carpet with a few stains but it wasn't bad. The only thing that should have been fixed or replaced was the shower nozzle which leaked a bit. Everything else was clean and functional. Since this is a hotel and not a collection of separate condos I can't imagine a room being too bad, if it is I'd ask for a change and they hopefully would comply. The views are great. Most rooms have a deck though they are not private, you'll be looking at neighbors and all walking by. The grounds are very well kept. According to the GPS it is 330 ft. above the beach. They have a shuttle to the beach. If you want to walk it's a nice walk on pleasant streets. It takes 15-20 minutes to reach Polo Beach and an additional 15-20 minutes to reach the place at Wailea Beach where the Diamond has a place where you can get a beach chair, towels and umbrella. The pathway along the shore appears to be unlit past Polo Beach at night. The one place where they've dropped the ball is the kitchen. They give you a stove with two electric burners, a small refrigerator and a small bar sink. But all you have to support that is 4 coffee cups, 4 spoons, a small assortment of glasses, a Japanese tea set whose small cups can be used for cereal bowls in a pinch, a wine cork remover and a bottle opener. Anything else you bring yourself. I see others have requested a kitchen set from the office, no mention of that was ever made, if it was the pasta and other items brought would not have been left over. As other have mentioned just a small improvement in this area would be welcome. The room did have Japanese sleeping mats stored away for use if wanted, along with Japanese style bath robes, a combo bath-shower area and a toilet with various spray controls and heated seat...

I called the desk directly and they quoted me a higher rate but then when I told them what Expedia was offering me, they matched it. Because I was getting such a great deal, I upgraded to a \"Deluxe Ocean View\". We had a king, non-smoking, and it was upstairs. I'll post a picture of our view ....180 degree view of ocean and we could see Molokini crater where we snorkeled! The grounds were very beautiful and quiet. Many wonderful flowers. We noticed that the staff would purposely walk or take their golf carts another direction rather than enounter you on the path to disturb you. The places are really 2 story mini-condos....large bedroom, kitchenette, small eating table, microfidge, living area, and lanai (balcony) complete with lounge chairs and flip flops. The bathroom was interesting - a toilet room with a Japanese style bidet; a shower room that was reminiscent of a college shower with a hand held nozzle...and a bathtub in that area also. The shower was probably my least favorite part of the room...they could have cleaned the shower door mildew a little better, but it was clean enough that I didn't hesitate to go in barefoot. The water pressure and hot water were great so I had plenty of long showers. There were terry robes in the closet. The closet also had extra bedding (for the sofabed, I assume), 2 large umbrellas and 2 beach towels (bonus!).

The bed was very comfortable. The sheets were crisp and smooth. We only ate at the Italian restaurant. We went the first night we were there because it was easy. We sat on the balcony, enjoyed the sunset and listened to their live music playing below. I think the prices were a bit higher than I'd have liked (30 -50 range), especially since I didn't much enjoy my meal that well, but others really liked theirs. My veal parm was a slab the size of Texas, but the pasta with it was really salty. The quail appetizer someone had was very flavorful, but $19 worth was 1 little bird..no sharing there!

(BTW, when I bought it, Hotwire was advertising car and hotel, but it turns out that was just a come-on to buy both, so I ended up having to book them separately at extra cost. I contacted Hotwire about the misleading headline and I notice it is not there now.) Nevertheless, even on Hotwire, the price was not cheap, so I was a little nervous, since I thought with a 4 star hotel in Wailea, I would get oceanfront, although not the Four Seasons or Grand Wailea. It turns out the hotel was up on a hill behind the oceanfront resorts. I read the reviews on Tripadvisor extensively and really liked the one who called himself Diamond Guy. Anyhow, these are my observations once I got there: 1) Very easy to find and very easy to access all of Wailea and Kihei for shopping, eating, and beach. 2) The valet service and all other staff were beyond friendly and helpful. 3) We were upgraded to ocean view which was lovely to watch the sunsets each evening and sit and read. 4) Property is beautiful and unbelievably quiet. 5) Went to the pool for hours everyday and saw almost no one else at the pool or on the property. 6) The spas are separate for men and women and don't believe that bathing suit optional stuff - they are not optional! I only went once to the women's and there were several others there, but it was still quiet. I did not partake in in any of the extra spa activities. 7) Never ate at the restaurants, but the Italian restaurant looked packed all the time and seems to be very popular for all visitors to Maui, not just residents of the hotel. 8) Now the room - a) the bed, as mentioned by other reviewers, was the biggest bed I have ever seen. We had our adult daughter with us and told her to just stay in the bed also since it was so big, but she decided to stay on the couch in the living room and we closed the doors between the two rooms (not too sound proof though). I never heard another sound in any other unit, but I think we were the only ones in our building (4 per building). I like that instead of putting everyone together in one part of the resort like some hotels - they spread guests all over the resort. b) The bathroom was pretty cool. The huge tub and shower are together behind glass doors with a little stool for the shower, so one can hold the shower head in your hand and bathe like the Japanese (there were many stations like this in the spa area too). The toilet was in a separate room all by itself, which was nice for the three of us to be able to use it without getting in anyone else's way. c) Kitchen is not full, but frig was big enough for us to keep adding soda pop, snacks, milk (and especially lots of poke if you like that sort of thing - great poke from the deli dept. at the local market in Kihei). No microwave, but a little sink and burners (which we never used). The kitchen is not stocked with dishes, etc., but we called and the supplies were brought to us immediately for the duration of our stay. d) I guess the only complaint I have about the whole resort was that the room was not as immaculate as I would have liked. I am a mirror fanatic and I could tell that they did not clean the mirrors regularly. They did clean everyday - kind of late, and we often had to call - but still no mirror cleaning. The rest of the room as cleaned though. On our last day, they were having a bug cleaning service come in which is apparently something that needs to be done frequently in Hawaii. We only saw a couple of bugs - and neither of them freaked me out. 9) Bottom line - I would definitely stay here again.

The lanai was fantastic and the view of the ocean was fabulous. This resort is at the top of a hill and is not right in the middle of the beachfront hotels. We didn't really think this was much of a problem because the walk wasn't too far for us. Most people would probably take a car down but we just walked. We were often times the only people at the pool and hot tub. The pool is small but heated and relaxing. There was no competition for lounge chairs or shaded tables. We are beach people and took the short drive to Big Beach/Little Beach which is only 5 to 10 minutes. There were plenty of towels and it was nice to come back and use the pool for a bit. The Japanese baths were included in the price and worth every cent. We went at night and after 30 minutes were relaxed and ready for bed. This is an overlooked amenity. We researched the proper process on the web and had no problems. We purchased the breakfast option and it was worth the extra money. You could choose from the Japanese style breakfast or American breakfast off of the menu. No buffet or food that was prepared hours ago. There were several choices and it was all quite good.

We stayed there (Sept 25-30) for my sister's wedding (which took place at the Four Seasons - about a 5 min drive) in an ocean view suite on the 2nd floor (Rm #163). -------------------------- Pros: -------------------------- - Price ($209/night) - Complimentary valet and parking - Quiet, beautiful location set on top of a hill - Spacious condo (~900 sq.ft.) with kitchenette (mini fridge, hot water dispenser, stove, sink, complimentary tea) and balcony - Japanese style bathroom (walk-in shower room with tub). This was convenient for rinsing shoes, snorkel gear, swim suit, etc.. - Sliding doors to separate bedroom from living room and doors to separate sink area and Japanese style toilet (another fun feature!) - great for privacy if you're sharing the room with friends - Free broadband (can borrow a laptop from the front desk) - Free use of the Japanese bathhouse spa (12pm-10pm). Never crowded. Had full use of their hot water spa and sauna. All the amenities are already in the spa (ie: towels, toiletries) so all you need to bring is your room key to access the spa. There are no attendants in the spa; only guests. We opted to keep our swimsuits on but everybody else tended to go naked. - An extraordinary amount of towels provided for you in the room (in all sizes) - Complimentary Neutrogena toiletries - Japanese breakfast ($15) at Restaurant Taiko. Recommend the Grilled Fish (mackerel/salmon). Came with rice, miso soup, pickels, shredded turnips and hot tea. A tasty and light way to start your morning! - Free shuttle service (can arrange at the front desk) - Short drive to Makena's Landing (less than 15 min) which is the starting point for most kayaking tours - Efficient cleaning staff (our room was always cleaned by the time we got back to the room) - Friendly, helpful front desk/valet staff - Close to the airport (30 min drive) -------------------------- Cons: -------------------------- - No HBO - Pool looked a bit outdated - Parking spaces were made more for compact cars (we drove a Dodge Avenger) - A bit of a drive to get to the more \"festive\" areas of the island (Lahaina: 30-40 min) - Need to call a dive shop to book water activities since there are no water activity operations located directly on the beach (such as in the Caribbean). Most activities start early (7am) since the waters get too choppy the later it gets. Recommend booking thru the Maui Dive Shop (8 locations throughout Maui). They booked us on the 2.5hr Turtle Reef Intro Kayak/Snorkel Tour (thru South Pacific Kayak Tours) for $65. Had a great time (fun guide and all equipment was provided). Short drive from the hotel (about 15 min to Makena's Landing). - Food was expensive (Wailea tended to be the pricier part of the island) -------------------------- Tips: -------------------------- - Go to the Maui Clothing Outlet in Kihei to purchase a swimsuit (all suits were almost 50% off regular retail prices). - Buy your souvenirs from the General Store. Seem to have the lowest prices. - Do a zipline tour. We booked ours through the Skyline Eco Adventures (Haleakala Skyline Tour). Awesome guides (Don/Jimmy) who were able to even get me (the person most nervous) to do all the lines! About an hour scenic drive from the Diamond Resort. -------------------------- Restaurant Picks -------------------------- - Kihei Cafe (Breakfast/Brunch, Local cuisine) - Maalaea Waterfront Restaurant (ask for Mike to be your waiter) - Restaurant Taiko (amazing Japanese breakfast) -------------------------- Conclusion -------------------------- Would most definitely stay at the Diamond Resort again. Nothing better after a long day of water activities than to relax in their hot Japanese bathhouse spa.

On the other hand, if you want a ocean view, a convenient location in Wailea, a LARGE suite, all for an incredibly reasonable price, then Diamond is worth your consideration. Although it is not directly on the beach, Diamond is just uphill about 2 minutes drive from the beachfront hotels. This was such a non-issue for us, esp since I had a car and you probably will too. Besides, how convenient is a \"beach front hotel\" when your room is on the 20th floor, 2 elevator banks, and 10 walkways away from the actual beach. By the time \"Beach Front Hotel Guy\" gets to the 2nd elevator bank, \"Diamond Resort Guy\" is already on the beach. For your driving trouble (barely), you get a spacious and comfortable townhouse style room, approx 900 sq ft, excellent views (if you so choose), and a wonderfully quiet and secluded location in Wailea. Ok, first of all, the resort public spaces are all top notch, very pleasant to stroll around, garden like with waterfalls and bridges, very scenic. Now for the really important stuff. The rooms are townhouse style, two floors, two suites per floor. We stayed in a top floor partial ocean view (#214), we felt like it was probably pretty close to a full ocean view and were very happy with the view. As already mentioned, the rooms are quite big, probably about 900 sq ft, and the bed could fit you and your 4 girlfriends (or boyfriends) if you are into that kind of thing. If you're not quite Hugh Hefner-like, you and yours could sleep sideways for fun I guess. Kitchenette with mini fridge, stove, sink (no microwave). Living room separated from bedroom by sliding doors. Couch in the living room is very comfortable, there is a tatami (think Japanese floor bed) if you want to put two bodies on the ground in the living room. Balcony off living room has 2 lay down pool chairs, lots of room. Bedroom is connected directly to the walk-in tub/shower room (Japanese style) with a shower door separating the bedroom from the walk-in tub/shower room. Some people might find the Japanese style tub/shower strange, we didn't think it was terribly inconvenient, and actually it was convenient to have a fully enclosed bath/shower \"room\" to wash our snorkel gear and such. Bathroom sink is in a separate closed space next to the bath/shower and toilet is a separate closed space off the bathroom sink room in the European style. Ok, someone mentioned dated furniture... yes, I'd guess the furniture is maybe 5 years old. You won't mistake this place for a W in terms of style, but I think it was fine, the comfort of the bed, sofa, and the storage spaces were definitely above average. Cleanliness was very good throughout the room and hotel, not quite Four Seasons clean but definitely equally clean or better than your average Westin. TV has a DVD player. We did not have any noise problems, very quiet. Maid service is very prompt, we left at various times of the day, sometimes for just 45 minutes for a quick bite to eat. Invariably, when we came back, the room would be made. It's like the maids magically knew exactly when we would leave and come back. Outstanding. Had some maintenance issues with A/C, these things happen at some point to everyone, the important thing is they were very prompt to fix it. Requests to the front desk for towels, etc to be brought to the room delivered promptly. Hotel spa is free to access (services extra), fully nude in the Japanese style, my wife said it wasn't over the top luxurious, but nice. Location: Pretty convenient if you have a car. We found beach, local road and highway access to be very convenient. Wailea and nearby Kihei has lots of restaurants, shops, beaches, but If you insist on spending all your days in, say, Kapalua, then you should go stay there. Wailea is about 45-50 minutes drive to Kapalua. We went up there for a day, can't say it's any better/worse than Wailea.. actually, Wailea seems like the newer resort area between the two. Just a matter of personal preference I think. The price: room rate was a great value for Wailea. Try doing a search for Wailea properties and compare, we found the Diamond Resort rate was very competitive for what you get. An aside about the choosing full or partial ocean view: the hotel is up on a slope of the hill. There are other condo developments downhill from the hotel. So, you will see either the roof of a condo, or the roof of a hotel building downhill from you. However, being that it is a hill, and all the buildings in the area are 2 stories, the so-called \"partial ocean view\" rooms on the top floor seemed to be pretty darn close to full ocean view rooms. Don't whine if you are not satisfied with a \"partial ocean view\" because you can see a branch or a roof top... it is partial for a reason, I'm just saying that what makes it \"partial\" is pretty negligible. Hotel restaurants: Capische? in the Diamond Resort was the best meal we had in Maui, romantic, outstanding Northern Italian food, best truffle risotto I've had outside of N. Italy, all dishes equally outstanding. You must try. Didn't find any compelling reasons to try their Japanese restaurant. If you want Japanese, Sansei in Kihei has early bird special 50% off sushi, cooked foods, all kinds of Japanese... quite good. If you want to eat there, call Sansei and ask them about the early bird special. Ok, conclusion: I think this is one of the best bang for the buck places I've stayed at in a while. It's comfortable, large, the right price, in a great location, and service is consistently good (they consistently try their best, within reason). You can't beat this place for around $240 a night (April, Partial Ocean).

It had the largest bed I have ever seen in my life -- somehow it was bigger than a king -- we could've fit a 200 pound man in between us and not been crowded.

My husband and I were experiencing some unneeded stress in LA, so we fled last minute to this hotel in search of a Japanese style spa. The place was booked, but we got one of their \"handicapped rooms,\" meaning that the deep bath and toilet are in the same room. They are separated by a shower curtain instead of separated by walls in the traditional Japanese way. I love Japanese-type showers when you can sit on a small stool and scrub and shower your body BEFORE getting in the tub, so I would have liked to have the walls onto which I could splash the showerhead around, but it was still cool. I would bathe at the spa everyday anyway... The room is huge and cheap compared to the smaller rooms at hotels down by the beach. And the spa was very traditional.. with showers and a dry steam room. The men and women's spas are separate, again - very traditional and comfortable. The main tourists here are Japanese, which helped me relax, because Americans sometimes forget to wash themselves completely before getting into the public bath..(ech!). so that was nice. AND - not many people use the spa... so you will definitely get many many minutes of alone time in there. The room even has a kitchenette with tons of utensils and pots and pans and plates.. Supermarket- SAFEWAY in Kihei is open 24 hours and their oranges (2lbs for $1) are great. The fish there is pretty fresh, too. ROY's Kihei has AMAZING Hawaiian Seafood and good Maui steaks- that Hawaiian Restaurant is near the SAFEWAY in the Piikea Rd. Complex. The hotel also has a laundry room ($2.50 total to wash and dry one load of clothes). CLOSEST BEACH AND OTHER COOL RESTAURANTS: Park down at the free parking at POLO BEACH... It is a 1 minute drive down the hill - make a left at the 4 lane crossing (Makena Alanui?), and park. You can either hang out here - OR- Walk towards beach, then take a right and walk on the boardwalk through amazing gardens. Please head to the Grand Wailea's HUMU... restaurant for the AMAZING Ahi Tempura appetizer (open at night). The 4 Seasons has a great restaurant that is open AM to PM -- Right on the beach - great views (we saw whales breeching!) surrounded by their excellent pool/fountain. Another great beach is a 10-15 minute drive south - BIG BEACH on Makena. Really great. There are places to eat on the road, but the really good one is a roadside BBQ with a house behind it - that is open from 11ish-4ish it says. We got there at 3:22PM - and it was closed, but I hear the food at this little joint rocks. If you drive further south, you will go through Makena National Park - a sea of molten lava on all sides. Feels like you are on Mars! Other than that - the staff is very helpful and everyone here is very friendly and quiet.

This was the best value for money we've ever had at on any vacation! The service is top notch, far beyond our expectations. The staff are very friendly, intelligent, and are always available at a moments notice. Lots of attention to detail, for example we would phone the front desk asking for our car in 5 minutes. The valet had our car waiting out front with the engine running, the top down and the radio re-tuned to a great local station. Our Alamo rental car was supplied with the inside of the windshield filthy, I called the front desk, 20 minutes later we went up to get the car, it was clean. We really appreciated the staff not hovering around expecting tips every time they looked at us. On more than one occasion I had to call them back to get their tip, even after they spent 10 minutes helping us unload groceries, driving us down to our room in the golf cart, and helping us put them away. We called asking for extra coffee supplies, the doorbell rang 90 seconds later, impressive considering this is a 17 acre resort with about 18 separate buildings. We were upgraded no charge to a top floor room with a 180 degree unobstructed ocean view including Kahoolawee and Molokini and many stunning sunsets and beautiful sunrises. We didn't really get a room, its more like a condo, a large bedroom with a truly massive bed, a large living room and dining area, a kitchenette with a built in Jenair stove top, and a good sized lanai (balcony) with loungers to enjoy the view. Birds literally ate out of hand on the lanai. Extra large beach towels are supplied in the room. A very well designed suite with many architectural details we liked, too much to list here. We paid about $200 a night, in other Wailea resorts with good service and smaller rooms you'll pay $300 to $400, sure they may be on the beach but the beaches are very crowded and by law are open to all anyway. We drove down the hill, a 1 minute trip, parked for free, walked along the sea walk through many big resorts such as the Grand Wailea and had full access to their over-crowded beaches and facilities. We quickly learned were to find an almost deserted beautiful beach with perfect gold sand, excellent snorkeling and swimming. It required a 5.5 minute drive from Diamond, the locals asked us not to tell anyone about the beach(we did not see any other tourists, actually we didn't see a lot of clothing on some people that we did meet!). We did not pay a resort fee, we did not get charged for dishes and cookware, we did not pay for valet or self park, we did not pay for computer and internet use in the library. We did not pay for the spa. They wanted $25 to use the gym, $50 with a trainer, it appears to be operated by a fitness chain, not the hotel, we skipped it. The spa is Japanese style. It has seperate sides for men and women so romance is out. You must be buck naked to go in, no clothing is allowed in the spa. That counted me out, I didn't go in. My wife went 3 times, theres usually only 2 or 3 people in it at a time. She has mixed feeling about it. Its well lit, so when you stand up in the sit and soak pool your bits and pieces are on display at eye level, not for everyone. Food: The Japanese restaurant is good but not excellent, we get better sushi in Vancouver for the same cost, its a bit open and noisy, not really a good choice for a romantic dinner but overall not bad. Le Gunji didn't exist when we were there, the patio bellow Capische was being renovated, maybe that has something to do with it. Capische has a nice setting with a great bar and really good live piano/bass entertainment. The service is excellent, all the staff was very attentive and friendly. The wine list is eye popping, many are $250 and up. Many hard to find top wines. The food was just plain awful. I had lamb shank on risotto with spring onions. The lamb was almost flavorless, like it had been rinsed under water after cooking (I really suspected it had). The risotto was so vinegary that I couldn't eat it, my wife tried it then went straight to her wine to kill the bitter taste. The spring onions were limp and wet and also tasted like they were boiled in vinegar. I don't know what happened - maybe some kind of kitchen accident? My wife had Ahi tuna, a very nice piece of meat, but the rest of the plate was disappointing. Desert was also very bad, the worst tiramisu we've ever had, usually one of our favorites. Out of 150+ fine dining experiences this is the worst food we've ever had, no question. We paid $200 for the two meals, one desert, 2 coffees(good) and $60 wine(the second from cheapest, excellent). The room food service is limited by time and choice. Breakfast is either Japanese or American, with limited options. We ordered one of each. The kitchen called to make sure we really wanted the Japanese, we should have taken the hint. DO NOT GET THE JAPANESE BREAKFAST!!! If a fish could be desert road kill it would look like this. The American style wasn't very good either. Two breakfasts were $39. There are dozens of dining opportunities near by, the hotel will shuttle you to any neighboring resort no charge. I believe the hotel is well aware of the restaurant issues and are working to improve them, we saw many hints of on going improvements, i.e. brand new chairs showed up at Capische half way through our stay. We generally don't eat more than once or twice at any hotel we stay at, we like to head out and experience the area, so the food issues had little impact on our rating. The kitchenette saved us at least $1000! Overall we were very happy and will be staying again next time we are in Maui. We were calling our suite \"home\" by the third day. Even after 16 days it was hard to leave. This resort is ideal for couples looking for a quite, relaxing, romantic stay. Families with kids needing constant entertainment may not like it here. Note that Wailea has a community association that keeps the area in pristine condition. Private security patrols the area constantly, including the hotel parking areas. We saw only one young \"punk\" driving too fast and squealing his tires, 2 security vehicles were on him in seconds and literally chased him out of town. I would not hesitate to walk the streets at night in Wailea. There is no graffiti or visible vandalism, no groups or gangs \"hanging out\" and virtually no litter.

It was fortunate the hotel was chosen for us, as it turned out to be far more appropriate for our needs than the Fairmont and Four Seasons, the others we considered. The hotel: The villas are surrounded by park-like grounds filled with waterfalls, pools and koi ponds. One rarely sees other guests and the entire resort is extremely quiet and peaceful. This was a pleasant surprise compared to the resorts on the beach. The swimming pool is small, good for an evening dip for kids who can't get enough of the water. The spa is a wonderful touch that we used almost every day, and it was remarkable to me that so few people did. The sushi restaurant is quite good, the Italian restaurant is ok and has an excellent view. Breakfast in the hotel is mediocre: The front desk advised against it and recommended another restaurant at the Shops at Wailea instead, which turned out to be a very good restaurant. The front desk is extraordinarily helpful, very pleasant, and the bellhops provided service just as good. The hotel also has a library with a desktop computer, useful for taking care of business when necessary or for printing out boarding passes in advance. The suites: We had a room labelled \"partial ocean view\", perhaps because we could see only part of the Pacific Ocean--but there was nothing but Pacific Ocean to be seen from our lanai or from any of the windows in the suite. The suites are large, about 700-750 square feet with a large kitchen/living area, a very large bath/dressing/toilet/closet area (including a large sunken tub and Japanese toilet) and a good sized bedroom with the largest bed we've ever seen. The setup worked well for us: Our two small children slept on the fold-out couch and we had the bedroom. The kitchen is small but worked well for breakfast and for light dinners. We found that full dinners in restaurants didn't work for us because we and the kids were too tired, so used lunch as a break for the day and ate light dinners in our suite at night. Overall pluses: Quiet, uncrowded resort; beautifully landscaped grounds; spacious and quiet, comfortable suites; kitchenette in suites; great spa; excellent service; superb views of the ocean; good price; free parking.

Comparing Kihea to Wailea is like comparing Harlem to the Upper east side - so close, yet worlds apart. This resort is in an excellent location, perched up a hill with excellent ocean views. But this is NOT an oceanfront resort. So if like to walk out of you room and onto the beach or into a beautiful pool, this is not your resort. You could however, walk to the beach in about 10 minutes. What I loved most about this place is that the suites are huge - I'd say about 650 sq feet - and each building has only 4 bright, airy suites, giving the entire resort an open, luxurious feeling. I have to admit that at their rack rate of $350 a night, this resort is no steal. I stayed in a full oceanview suite for $200 a night. Do not book this resort online. Call them and ask for the $200 special (especially during off-season). This is a great deal considering that your neighbors at the Grand Wailea, Four Seasons, and the Fairmont are all paying around $500 a night. The spa onsite is top notch. So is the japanese/sushi restaurant. Take a raincheck on their pool and Italian restaurant. You are sorrounded by resorts with much better pools and restaurants. For the reviewers who gave this resort bad reviews because of a $4 charge for renting utensils and microwaves - all I have to say is you could save a lot more than 4 bucks if you stayed in Kihea.", "Date": "September 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reno, NV", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3691617", "Content": "I got married on the property and found it to be so, so beautiful and serene.

This is a problem in Wailea where you're more or less dependent on your hotel. When we first checked in we loved the view and the balcony, and the place was huge. However we got tired of having to pay resort prices, but still had to drive down the hill to find an open restaurant or bar, or even go to the beach. The Japanese-style baths were cold and not relaxing. I have been to hot spring baths in Japan, and that is an inviting and invigorating experience. This was not. There is also a normal pool and hot tub, but they are only open until 6 pm! There are three restaurants: two Japanese, and one Italian. The Japanese-French one is not really haute cuisine like they make it sound. That's probably why the restaurant is almost always completely empty. The Italian restaurant is a little more lively, and we enjoyed having a drink at the outdoor bar there, but it doesn't stay open late like other bars in Maui. We didn't visit the third, because it was always closed. The condo has a Japanese-style shower-room and separate toilet room. These could have been cleaner, or updated. The kitchen was very small with a mini electric stove and no oven, no microwave, no dishwasher, no dish drainer. And you had to rent a set of pots that didn't include much. The refrigerator was tiny and filled with frost, and froze all our food, so we didn't cook very much in the room. The king bed really is two twins pushed together. I couldn't believe it. The employees were very nice, though it's true that not many spoke English well enough to give you tourism advice or directions. I think that's a primary function of any hotel and shouldn't be overlooked. The grounds are well kept and the sunsets are a glorious sight from your balcony. It's very quiet with no children and I appreciated that. But as we visited other Wailea resorts throughout the week, and sat on their beaches with tropical drinks, and ate at fun restaurants, and watched people relax on loungers at the pool all day, I couldn't help but feel that was the Maui experience we had wanted to have, and the Diamond was just lacking. My advice is either to pay more for a true Wailea resort on the beach, or stay in a friendly condo in laid-back Kihei.", "Date": "March 30, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Wailea", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g609129-d247776-Reviews-Hotel_Wailea-Wailea_Maui_Hawaii.html", "Price": "$247 - $353*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">555 Kaukahi Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Wailea</span>, Maui, <span property=\"v:region\">HI</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">96753</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "247776", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/32/f8/32f8ca30e450f6f488a2ca5377a9fc003large.jpg"}}
