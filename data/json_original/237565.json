The customer service is good, the staff were nice and helpful. The free breakfast was much appreciated as well. The condition of the room and the lobby area has room for improvement.

It is directly across the street from a small park, one of the only parks in the city. An excellent coffee shop (Two For Joy) next door, and a grocery store in the same block are great conveniences.

Hotel owner and reception was friendly checking up on the needs of their visitors. Mostly smiling.. Like all locals of Amsterdam, they spoke perfect English. If you need anything to be arranged, make sure to ask during the morning / breakfast hours, as there is no one later to call a taxi or anything. Luckily, a taxi stop is about few hundred meters away, will take you to Centraal (train) station (10 euro), or Schipol Airport (40 euro). I had made the reservations using credit card. What I found out when we were leaving, they charge additional 5 % over total cost (hotel stay+5% city tax) for using a charge card. Hotel has multiple floors, but very narrow steep steps one needs to climb. Ask for lower floor if you have suitcases as it may be difficult to get up there. Continental breakfast is included in room price. A pot of coffee or tea, white / wheat bread for toasting, rolls, butter, jam, sliced cheese, etc.A table with couple of chairs in front of the building, where one can sit, smoke, have a cup of coffee while watching the passerby. A collection of longplay record covers are displayed on the walls of breakfast area, a working antique juke box has music choices from 60/70s. First quad room on third floor was quiet, looking at the back of the building, and small interior garden, offered clean bedding, but didnt have any soap or anything, or enough towels for four. Perhaps they forgot to replace. We had our own, so we didnt mind, and did not ask for it. Second quad room we used on the first floor looking at the street was much nicer. Everything we didnt have in the other quad room, was included in this room. Unfortunately in the second room, we couldn't fall asleep due to running or dripping water sounds of the radiators all night. Hotel is walking distance to everywhere one wants / needs to see in Amsterdam. Lots of trams running all day long as well. Weather was not as great while we were in Amsterdam. On again / off again drizzling rain most of the week. But it didnt stop us wondering through the city, sitting at the cafes in the center.

The room we got was probably (and hopefully) the smallest and dullest room of the hotel. It was in a small garden house, completely separated from the actual building. The privacy it gave us was ok, but the room was the smallest I've ever seen. It was difficult to fit two small pieces of luggage in the room. In addition to that, the room was VERY worn out and quite dirty. Also the bathroom was very shabby. The room was also very cold, and had a noisy (and suspiciously looking) external heater to keep the temperature decent. There was also another room in the garden house, but it seemed to be the hotel loundry... We had a quite cheap internet booking, so I'm not sure if that had something to do with the fact that we got such a small and shabby room.
