{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Living la dolce vita!! BB InPiazzaDellaSignoria is a gem that requires no polish. It is a small BB that is located in the absolute best location to visit Florence....the Piazza Della Signoria. This was our second visit  we have stayed in three rooms. All lovely  very comfortable. Individually furnished with antiques with modern stylized bathrooms. All three were deluxe rooms, one which was a triple. All well above average room size for hotels in Europe. The rooms that have varying degrees of view are more costly than the rooms that don't, but all rooms, deluxe or not are large  lovely. This year, we introduced our friends to the BB  they were delighted with one of the standard rooms. In this case, stardard is just a term to differentiate the location of the rooms as they are by no means standard!!The bathrooms do not have a hotel feel to them. They are more like you would see in a show home in a Design magazine. The bath products are luxurious  large. In one room there was a soaker tub large enough for two  there was even a candle to complete the picture. Glass pitchers and glasses are provided in each room with mineral water coolers outside in each hall. It is the little things like this that make the BB InPiazzaDellaSignoria special!!Breakfast is held in a room with a large communal table that seats, I think, 14....a chance to exchange trip advice from other travellers. We found out about a great restaurant around this table! The table is set with pitchers of fresh orange juice, homemade cake, yogurt  granola. Then you are brought individual fruit plates  plates of bread  croissants. By request they will make you bacon  eggs or an omelet. Previously thinking this was a bit too North American to do, I must admit that it was a pleasant change after 3 weeks of the typical European buffet. The staff and management are wonderful. Monica has been particularly helpful during our visits. Owners Alessandro  Sonia Pini have taken much care  attention to every detail to ensure a very comfortable and pleasureable stay. It is more like staying in a home than an impersonal hotel. They have recently added 4 new rooms located accross the Piazza which look every bit as inviting!!To our delight there is an excellent restaurant  wine bar next door called the Dei Frescobaldi. It is not cheap, but the food was exceptional. Also as you walk out of the hotel into the Piazza, walk a block, turn right  immediately on your left is some of the best gelato in Italy!An incredible Piazza, fabulous restaurant, great gelateria  most of all beautiful accommodations at the BB InPiazzaDellaSignoria....now that is.living la dolce vita!!!!", "Date": "Nov 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR773508581", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Triplanner"}, {"Content": "Fabulous!! This is an absolutely wonderful place, and I highly recommend it. The location can't be beat - right at the corner of the Piazza della Signoria, steps from the Uffizi (a must-see), and walking distance to the most wonderful places to visit in Florence. The staff is incredibly friendly, helpful, knowledgable, and attentive. They consistently go above and beyond expectations. The breakfasts were the best we had over our 2 week stay in Italy in 5 different locations; fresh squeezed juice, fresh fruit, fresh rolls, yogurt, and eggs cooked to request if desired, all served with smiles and overlooking an amazing view of the Piazza. We stayed there 3 different times over our 2 week stay, and used it as our 'home base'. And it did feel very homey, though professional, too. The rooms and bathrooms were all lovely, spacious, and exceptionally clean. This was our favorite place of all the ones in which we stayed, and I can't recommend it highly enough. It is well worth the money.", "Date": "Mar 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR409401688", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "JBBCameronPark"}, {"Content": "Wonderful B This is a wonderfully decorated BB, with each room having its own theme. Everything is very clean and amenities modern. It's just like staying in an intimate luxury hotel.The owners are extremely friendly and very helpful with tips on restaurants and how to get to places. The location of the hotel is very convenient but as it is in a corner of a piazza can be hard to find.

The Residenza was recommended from an Italian guide from Rome. We found it to be very clean, with friendly staff, interesting and spacious rooms. It was extremely convienient to tour Florence from this great location. The price was very reasonable as well, making this a great value. For a couple or a family (ours were older kids) this was a wonderful place!", "Date": "Jan 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR592742560", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "entshop"}, {"Content": "Incredible location and service! This bed and breakfast is located directly in Piazza Della Signoria which is steps from the famous Ufizzi museum (a must see!) and a few more steps to Pontevecchio (famous bridge crossing the Arno river) with many great things Florence has to offer! The rooms were spectacluar, large and had all the comforts you could expect. Far bigger than other rooms I've stayed in throughout Italy, I highly recommend this outstanding BB. Incidentally, breakfast of fresh fruits, amazing coffee, assorted breads, meats and cheeses, and eggs to order was an excellent touch. Prices were great and the staff was exceptionally helpful!! You can walk to everything in Florence from this amazing BB.", "Date": "Aug 15, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR927546005", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "johnthyne"}, {"Content": "Great Place But Beware of Noise We spent 3 nights at this lovely BB, with the best location in Florence, right on the Piazza della Signoria. Monica, the manager is incredibly organized and helpful--even before we arrived in Florence, arranging tours, transfers from the train station, and a drive through the Tuscan countryside. She's also very helpful with restaurant recommendations. The rooms are beautiful, with huge bathrooms. The only problem is the noise--our room was on the Piazza side, and it was as if the windows were wide-open (which they weren't in December). We could hear everything on the street, all night long. Our earplugs helped, as did keeping the fan on for the heating system. But if you are sensitive to noise, make sure to ask for a room on the non-Piazza side. DO NOT STAY IN THE MATTEO SUITE! We had a large party (4 rooms) and for our last night, 4 of our members had to move to the Matteo. As the other reviewer indicated, it's really a bit bizarre, not to mention unsafe. Not only are there no lights in the stairwell, we got stuck in the tiny elevator for quite some time! We complained to Monica, who did the right thing and did not charge us for that night.", "Date": "Jan 4, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR679517946", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Quirky hotel - very good location This was the second stop on our Italy tour (first was Rome). After being spoiled by the staff at the wonderful Residenza Cellini this hotel was rather a jolt. We had reserved the Matteo flat for four persons/three nights. The rate was good: 280 euros per night (70 apiece), but there were some issues with the flat: it was in a completely seperate part of the building from the rest of the hotel, with a seperate entrance so there was no service (maid service, etc.). At first we thought the layout was clever and interesting: one bedroom upstairs with an adjoining bathroom, the main floor with a central area and a kitchenette, and a downstairs bedroom and bath. There were no closets or dressers in the entire flat so we lived out of our bags for three days. This wouldn't have been so bad if everything in the upstairs area hadn't become damp the first morning we took a shower - and stayed damp. The bed, our clothes, everything was damp. If we'd been able to open a window this might not have been a problem, but the window upstairs was at roof level so I understand there was a security concern. The other major issue was the stairwell outside the flat. It was dark all the time; no lights even at night, and there was debri in the stairwell from contractors working on other units in the building. It was like living in a bombed out building during the war or something! Very strange.The website advertises e-mail (computer) access, but what this turns out to be is an ancient laptop that creaks along - barely able to function. It took an average of five minutes to open, read, and respond to a single e-mail message. Unacceptable by any stretch of the imagination. If you're going to advertise that your business has a working computer for guests to use then please have something available that functions reasonably well. After reading the comments other guests had written in a journal in the hotel's main reception area I wish that we'd stayed in one of the regular rooms - or someplace else. There were many glowing reports of Sylke's (the owner) warm and wonderful hospitality. Unfortunately we didn't get to experience it.", "Date": "Nov 18, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR744754708", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d514817-r21913500-Residenza_d_Epoca_in_Piazza_della_Signoria-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "514817", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
