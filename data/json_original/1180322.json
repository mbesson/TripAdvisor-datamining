{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Fabulous budget option on Monkey Forest Rd. I'm very surprised to see there's only one review for Ubud Bungalows! This place is nothing short of awesome.. It's directly next door to Ubud Inn (where I stayed previously, and Ubud Bungalows was a huge improvement) on Monkey Forest Rd, and an easy walk or motorbike ride into town.My single room was only USD $20, and I was given the choice of either the top or main floor on an entire bungalow. Meaning I had my own entryway, patio with table and chairs looking out onto the gardens, and room with full sized bed, ceiling fan, brand new furnishings and bathroom appliances. Everything was very clean and seemingly new.Breakfast was standard, but still very good: fruit, coffee or tea, and scrambled eggs with toast. There's a nice pool with deck chairs for relaxation, and the walkway to the bungalows is lined with hibiscus and frangipani trees. So pretty! If you value privacy, this is the place for you. An added bonus is that the staff leaves you alone and doesn't try too much to persuade you into booking tours or transportation with them.", "Date": "Nov 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR762088005", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "bellagreen"}, {"Content": "Magnifico       area de piscina", "Date": "Oct 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR710263707", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ShaktiPuertoRico"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d1180322-r21510657-Ubud_Bungalow-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1180322", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
