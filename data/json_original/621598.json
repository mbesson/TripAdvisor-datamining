Nonetheless, it undeniably satisfied my requirements, excepting maybe for the WiFi internet connection with a reasonable speed in the morning (8, 77 Mbps), then dropping (2, 55 Mbps) and fluctuating in the late afternoon. But other than that I had no complaints. Mr. Karim, the hotel manager, arranged for a shuttle to pick me up at the airport at a price of 35 dirhams, which is less than the cost of a taxi fare between 40 and 45 dirhams from the airport to the same area in Bur Dubai. Check-in was fast and easy and the staff were helpful and friendly. The complimentary dates in the lobby are worth mentioning because they are delicious. My studio apartment, with a balcony facing the street and flooded by Dubai\u2019s radiating morning sun, was very spacious with a double bed, a kitchenette, a flat-screen TV, a sofa and a work desk. I liked the decoration of the room, which I found very sober and attractive. The kitchenette was well equipped with a big refrigerator, an electric kettle, a toaster, a two-plate stove and a microwave. I couldn\u2019t possibly wish for more. Local landline calls are complimentary and so is parking for hotel guests. In general, the staff were very courteous and helpful. I was impressed with the young Nepalese, Raj Kumar, who was tireless in his efforts to clean my room at the time I had asked for, always leaving everything spotless. The roof pool was luckily never crowded and offered the opportunity to bask in the sun without being too torrid (Christmas season) on the days that were a bit windy at the beach. The Bur Dubai area, where all three Savoy hotel apartments are located, is one of my favourites. It is a quiet quarter far from the hustle and bustle of the nearby commercial streets, suitable for noise-sensitive people and with the appearance of a residential area.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chonburi, Thailand", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hospitality\u201d", "Author": "praphatsorn_psc", "ReviewID": "UR121757474", "Content": "We stayed 5 nights in a cleaned Studio which fully kitchen and also bigger than we had in many countries.

I was told to wait in my room at 1 o'clock and woud receive a telephone call telling me which room I would be moving to.

On the last day we decided to have lunch delivered by room service and my husband went to the cafe and ordered and paid for it. He was told that it would be delivered within 30 minutes which was fine but after an hour he had to go back downstairs and ask why it had not been delivered. He was told that it would be sent up soon!!!!!! This is not what I would call good service.
