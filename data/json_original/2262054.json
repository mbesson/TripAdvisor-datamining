It is new small and personal. Everything was in perfect working order, almost brand new, clean and tidy. Reception was very friendly and helpful - with the night staff communication in English or German was a problem, but somehow we managed to communicate. As the room safe was too small for our notebooks, we deposited themn at reception. The rooms were spacious (probably around 18m\u00c2\u00b2) and nicely decorated in the regional style. The bathroom was quite adequate, even though it was somewhat small. Free WLAN worked well enough for normal internet research. The only minor complaint was that the breakfast starting time was not always punctual, which meant that one had to rush to keep early appointments. The breakfast quantity and variety were quite in oder - there was some variation form day to day - and there was always enough to satisfy varying tastes - even if one cannot call it a \"luxury breakfast\". The quality might be improved somewhat in some respects (the juices tasted more like sweetened syrups than fresh juice, the scrambled eggs often were lumpy and caked together (egg powder?) and a plain unsweetened muesly would be a pleasant alternative to the sweetened cereals).", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cnice comfy convenient\u201d", "Author": "Rouge K", "ReviewID": "UR122119215", "Content": "nice hotel, small rooms, great location though. walking distance from the blue mosque.

The hotel is located on a small cozy alley at very center of old town, right behind Blue Mosque and near to St. Sofia and Sultanahmet square (Hippodrome). Excellent starting point for a tourist and quick access to city transport. Polite and very useful staff. As far as, this was our first visit of Istanbul they were very kind and helpful guiding us. Initially, I heard contradictory opinions about hotels in Istanbul thus, I was a bit suspicious. Fortunately, everything was superb and we were pleased staying at Maritime hotel. Actually, I was told the hotel is brand new, 1 month old. Place is quiet even though, the Blue Mosque is close to the hotel, very good noise isolation. Everything is new and shine. There is a roof terrace with beautiful view. Continental breakfast, I would say rather good. Little bit diversity would be great. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got nice weather and we spent very nice days in a remarkable city. If the hotel was a dump that would ruin our vacation. I am glad, I picked Maritime hotel up. There is a lot to see in Istanbul and definitely, we will visit it again soon.
