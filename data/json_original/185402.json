When we arrived the rooms smelled horrible. Ended up changing rooms but as the day continued our \"new\" rooms started to smell worse and worse like sewage. A/C didn't work, safe deposit box originally did not work as well as one of their two elevators for a 13 story hotel did not work which we were told never works when it rains. It rained every day of our stay. One night around midnight while sleeping someone opened my door but luckily I had the security lock so that person could not come in. The front desk had given a key to my room by mistake to another guest. The list goes on and on. definitely avoid this hotel at all costs.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "austin", "Title": "\u201cits, ok.\u201d", "Author": "tripnexus", "ReviewID": "UR105891867", "Content": "As a business traveler, I would have to say it was ok.

Our biggest complaint about this hotel was the NOISE and the BEDS. they just remodeled and claim they put double pane windows. But if you decide to stay here take EAR Plugs, you can hear all honking and traffic. I travel to Mexico every year, but these beds were the worst beds EVER. It was like sleeping on concrete slabs. We were waking up in the morning with sore backs and necks. It was 50 degrees at night the rooms do not have heating but the hall ways do. we were freezing at night. DO NOT stay here. Not worth it.

After coming back to DF from San Miguel de Allende, we decided to stay at Casa Inn. The room needed cleaning, the walls were kind of dirty, the carpet dirty too, and a few of the bathroom's tiles were broken. The overall quality of the room was very low. Since I had to leave at 6am, the lady in charge of the breakfast told me that I would get a bag with some cakes before departing as my breakfast was included with my room. The morning that I had to leave I went down to the front desk at 5:30am but the person there told me that he had not been informed about providing any breakfast for my room. I just could not believe that I had paid for my breakfast and the manager just let me go without it. I told them to call me a cab to go to the airport and they got me a private SUV. I told the driver that I just needed a regular cab, which usually charges you around $35 from that area to the airport (I had done it before). He said that a regular taxi would charge me around $180. Since I had to rush to take my flight, I had to pay him $150 for the ride. I was ripped off, and the hotel was responsible for getting me this kind of transportation.

When it didn't take an hour to get our food, they gave it to another room. There was no kettle or coffee maker in the room...so had to go without it. Their carpets need cleaning.
