{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A wonderful stay with a presonal touch! This was a wonderful treat over the New Year 2008-2009 holiday. The hotel is small (according to their info., the smallest 3 star in Amsterdam). It has 9 rooms only and is in a lovely (and lovingly) restored building next to the Concert House in the museum district. We stayed for four nights.Our group occupied 2 rooms, a single and a triple. Each room had sort of kitschy, quirky furnishings (nice for us), and the single had a balcony. The triple had a large bright window, with a scenic view over the courtyard. The triple also had ample space for 3 of us (a large double bed plus a single), and each room had a recently renovated bathroom with shower ensuite. The owner was very friendly and helpful and made our stay quite enjoyable. He offered tips for restaurants, as well as gave detailed instructions for the tram and where to park our car. (Be aware that the parking at olympic stadium advertised on the web is a 15 minute tram ride away from the hotel, but easliy accessible by tram. It's much cheaper to leave the car there, as there is very limited and expensive parking around the hotel, and so we chose that option.) The location, a 5 min walk from Van Gogh Museum and 10 minute tram ride to Dam Square, was very nice. The tram is easy to ride and stops right outside the door. You can pay cash on the tram (no exact fare needed) or purchase tickets in advance. We found it simple to ride the tram wherever we needed.Given the fact it was New Years, the city was especially busy and noisy (the fireworks were incredible), but we felt comfortably in the middle of the action, without being too overwhelmed by the drunken revellers in the center.Breakfast was quite nice, basic but filling: juice, coffee, croissants, eggs, cereal, toast and pastry, and the owner was happy to accomodate the time for individual guests. He even offered a late-night sandwich and snacks for of one our party who was ill and couldn't venture out for food late at night. He stepped right into the kitchen and began making up a plate as soon as we asked for options.I would definitely return here. This is not a hotel for those looking for a safe hotel chain experience, but if you want a little bit of personal Amsterdam-styling, with an almost BB feel, this is perfect.One note: I could imagine with the wrong guests, this could be a noisy hotel, as insulation between rooms is minmal. However, most of those in the hotel were quite respectful and tried to minimize the noise after hours.", "Date": "Jan 7, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR255313954", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "cheepcheeptravel"}, {"Content": "Good value hotel in the museum district I stayed in twin room on the top floor for 2 nights. The room itself was a bit larger than expected but it was apparent that it had not been refurnished for quite some time. It was however clean and had everything that can be expected from a 3-star hotel (TV (with cable), mini-bar, free coffee/tea). The beds were reasonably comfortable but a bit small (perhaps to be expected in a twin room). The bathroom was nice with a small bath tub and it seemed to have been renovated at a later date than the rest of the room. I liked the fact that there was a skylight that let in some extra light.As in many hotels in Amsterdam the stairs are very steep and narrow and as far as I could see there was no elevator. This was not a problem for me but it may make the hotel less suitable for people travelling with children and/or travelers who have trouble walking/moving around.The hotel is set on a quiet street in the museum district of Amsterdam (behind the concert hall). It can be a bit tricky to find since the street it is on does not seem to be a very well known street. Most people do however know the concert hall so if asking for directions it is better to ask for the concert hall. Buses as well as trams (number 5 and 16) from the central station stop very close to the hotel. The location is great if you plan on spending some time going to museums. If you plan on partying in closer proximity to the central station there may, if merely looking at the location, be better options. The staff was very friendly and had a lot of good advice on things to see and do in Amsterdam. Breakfast was also served in the mornings (from 8-10) but I never managed to get up in time for that. Other guests did however seem to enjoy it.", "Date": "Jul 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR850624396", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "thesaint01"}, {"Content": "restful location This is a very comfortable and quiet little hotel in a lovely location. We walked across the city from Centraal Station upon arrival - a leisurely day, taking in Dam Square, the flower market etc - and, in our opinion, the scenery and atmosphere improved as we got nearer the museum quarter. This area suited us well as a family for a short break. We used the canal bus on the next day to reach the Anne Frank museum and to see the city from the water, which was very pleasant. We also liked the Jordaan area. But best of all, we enjoyed the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh museum on the hotel's doorstep, and lazing in the sunshine in nearby Vondel Park. There was an ample choice of suitable places to eat, and the staff at the hotel were very willing to point us in the right direction. We had a very relaxing week-end, and the Heemskerk (right behind the Concertgebouw) provided us with a cosy and peaceful base.", "Date": "Jul 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR743998984", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "gwynfa"}, {"Content": "Beautiful hotel, good staff This hotel is close to the Van Gogh museum and many other beautiful attractions.

Great location for museums and bus to Keukenhof. Beds were very comfy. Slept great both nights. Staff recommended an Italian restaurant within short walking distance. Best food I had on the trip. Breakfast was simple and delicious. Had a mishap my last day getting locked in the bathroom (latch broke), but they sprung me in time to catch my train back to Paris! Staff was very friendly. There were a lot of stairs to maneuver as it is a traditional Amsterdam School building.

With an excellent location, extremely friendly and helpful owner and no major complaints whatsoever, the Heemskerk is easy to recommend, and it seems almost churlish to add a few buts...As other reviewers have said, the location is great, in a refined quiet area with museums on the foorstep and excellent transport links via the tram system.When you arrive at central station, just jump on a tram and for one euro 20 you are there in ten minutes. Dont get a taxi, its not worth it..Our room was compact with a small bathroom, it had the usual items such as a mini-bar, TV etc, but you have to bear in mind this is in an old building which has been converted into a hotel and so there is not the space or level of comfort or furnishings that comes with modern purpose-built hotels. For many this may be part of the charm.However, and here is my main sole reservation, while hotels in Amsterdam are expensive, and good ones on a budget difficult to find, this is no bargain. We paid approximately 140 euros a night and for an out of city centre location (though still conveniently close it has to be said) and for the level of comfort and furnishings, it is not cheap.Again, I stress, Amsterdam is expensive for accommodation and undoubtedly, closer to Dam Square, there will be numerous hotels which are more expensive and less cosy, but compared to other European cities, and hotels I have stayed in, on the cost to comfort ratio, this does not particularly shine.I have no hesitation in recommending it to people who are in Amsterdam for the museums etc, rather than the pot smoking and partying, and the owners etc are superb, just dont expect if you are paying 140 euros a night to come away thinking as well as good hotel, you have found a real bargain. That may be impossible to do in Amsterdam but I suspect if we return we may look again.And one basic bit of advice, which is completely blindingly obvious but still - everything (food, drink etc) costs three times as much in the Dam Square area as anywhere else. Blindingly obvious, but dont sit down for a beer and find yourself paying 8 euros and being surprised!", "Date": "Jun 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR858996616", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "James003"}, {"Content": "Really nice! Small, nice hotel. Had a double room with bathroom. The room was a bit small, and so was the bathroom, but I don't usually spend much time in the room so I didn't mind the smaller space. Very friendly and helpful staff. Did not find breakfast so great, was very few choices when i was there, so it was not worth the price if you don't have breakfast included.

Stayed at this wonderful hotel in July with my partner and 2 children. Our room was large and spacious with a fantastic jacuzzi bathroom. The room was quiet, clean and airy. The best part of the hotel was the delicious breakfast which the kids just adored and would have spent all day munching their way through the scrummy croissants and toast if allowed!

If you're looking for a small hotel with a personal touch, this is indeed it. The proprieter and his staff aim to please. Norman said, this is your home in Amsterdam .... and he meant it! The location is ideal: walking distance to the tram, restaurants, museums and beautiful Vondelpark (which is nothing like the hippie hang-out I remember from the 70s.)Our room was fine. Unlike the generically-decorated Best Western we stayed in in Paris, I really felt like I was in Europe here. Four people in one room was a bit cramped. Our bathroom, complete with jaccuzi, was very nice -- but not suitable for an elderly traveler. (My 80 year old mother was afraid she was going to slip in the tub - which is where the shower was.)Breakfast was delicious and reasonably priced. However, with the decreased value of the dollar, we thought our room was a bit pricey ..... but I would recommend it, and I would stay there again.", "Date": "Jul 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR174688130", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Meredith5001"}, {"Content": "Loved it, absolutely recommended. My family and stayed here for two nights, April 20th. We had a triple and a twin room, rooms 8 and 10. We were very happy with the rooms, they were beautiful, decorated individually and with antiques. The twin even had a remote control type thingy to open an close a skylight. The triple room was a little more cramped (3 beds in it!) but still decorated nicely and comfortable. The beds were comfortable and there were some nice touches not normally found in b and bs, such as mini bars!! The owner was extremely friendly and helpful during our stay, always smiling. The bathrooms were nice, big enough and a lovely shower and bath ( I tried them both!) We didn't have breakfast. But I would guess they were nice, as the service for everything else was excellent. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone. It is gay friendly. The location was great for us, if you're going to amsterdam for a silly weekend of booze and drugs and girls, this probably shouldn't be your first choice, although it would probably still be ok! It is located right near a beautiful park, and the van gogh and rembrandt museums. The tram stops right outside, tram 5 from the central station stops right about 50 foot from the door. It is the stop after the van gogh museum, not the one in front of the van gogh museum. We think the stop was called museumplein. We had a great time here, if I go back to Amsterdam again I would book here early. Hope this helps you with your choice.
