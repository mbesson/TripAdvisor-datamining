I booked it based on the reviews I'd read about on Tripadvisor and it definitely lived up to expectations. Luisa, its owner, is lovely. She is kind and thoughtful, very easy-going, very helpful and genuine. A good person. Before I booked the hotel, I asked a lot of questions and Luisa also answered my emails promptly and gave good advice. Her team , among them Vincenzo, Daniel, and Lorenzo were equally helpful. Like Luisa, they answered all our questions about where to go in Rome & how to get there with interest and patience. The hotel even provides a handout giving a list of restaurants you can find close by and our group of five found this truly useful. They also give a handout listing the tourist attractions in Rome and telling you the buses you can take to get there, and we travelled everywhere with that list. Palm Gallery also provides breakfast and the variety of food we got was great - several types of juices, bread, cheese, croissants, ham, a variety of jams, danish, and excellent coffee and cappucino. There's also eggs - any way you want them cooked. We went in early spring and the weather was often good enough to have breakfast outside in the outdoor patio. A leisurely breakfast with the sun streaming down - wonderful! The hotel is in an excellent location. It's in a quiet neighbourhood with easy access to the city. The bus stop is nearby (about five minutes' walk) and so is the metro and so it was very easy to go places. The rooms in Palm Gallery are thoughtfully decorated and very clean and it was always a pleasure, after a long day of sight-seeing and walking, to arrive back at the hotel and our rooms. If I'm ever asked about accommodation in Rome, the Palm Gallery is the hotel I'm going to recommend!", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Crawley, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAnother great visit\u201d", "Author": "Mabel12345", "ReviewID": "UR128232874", "Content": "I visited The Palm Gallery in November and wrote a review and said it was so good I would go back, I did just that in March 2012.

For more details please see my previous review but I wanted people to know that I did return as the hotel is warm, friendly and very child friendly. I didnt have children with me but another family did and the owner bought a cake out on the little boys birthday and we all sang Happy Birthday on the lovely sunny terrace. That terrace will stay with me for a long time. We have been lucky with the weather on both our trips, warm sun all the way.

Her amazing staff, Lorenzo, Vincenzo, and Amir assisted us with breakfast at the hotel, restaurant reservations, directions to local stores, transportation services, and so much more. The hotel is located in a beautiful and picturesque residential neighborhood. Our room was spacious, very clean, and nicely decorated. The front patio is a great place to relax any time of the day ... enjoy a cup of espresso... a glass of wine and cheese from a local market... or just unwind taking in the beauty of the local landscape and architecture. During our visit, we found it most convenient to use the metro to travel around the city. We also enjoyed exploring Rome by foot, adding 5-10 miles of exercise to our daily routine, allowing us to indulge in delicious Italian meals and, of course, Gelati ice cream. Within walking distance of the hotel, you\u2019ll find beautiful parks, local bus stops, the metro, grocery stores, and restaurants. Day trips to Florence and Naples are possible, thanks to Italy's express train - 2 hours from Rome to Florence.

The hotel is located in a very quiet neighborhood away from the crowds of tourists. We slept with the windows open each night we were there and were not disturbed at all. The rooms are very clean and give you the feeling of a private home rather than staying in a hotel. The staff is excellent and they were very accommodating. They assisted with transportation and recommendations for restaurants. We also booked the bus transfer to the airport on our last day. When I booked the hotel, I was concerned about the distance from all the sights and the need to rely on buses and the metro to get around. I can honestly say that we did not have any major problems using the busses or trains; we got everywhere we needed to and saw everything on our list. Anyone who has used mass transit in a large city will not have any issues getting to/from the sights downtown. There is a newspaper stand located adjacent to the 62 bus route which sells bus passes. The bus stop is located a brief 3-5 minute walk from the hotel and the metro is about 10-15 minutes. A couple things we noticed about the mass transit, in the morning the bus can be very crowded with workers heading downtown, between 8-10am all the busses we saw/rode were very crowded. In the evening, the busses were crowded during the usual rush hour 4-6pm, but later in the evening there was no issue. One day we decided to take the metro train and upon arrival at the station we found that the crews were on strike. We were unaware of the strike and apparently everyone waiting to get into the station was also unaware. We took a cab to the main train station which cost 10 euro. The metro did begin running again around 3pm in the afternoon. One day we walked from the Spanish Steps back to the hotel, the walk was not horrible but we probably should not have attempted it after walking around all day. It took us close to 45 minutes to get back. If you are going to walk to the steps, start out in the morning and then take the bus/train back in the afternoon when you are tired. There is a lot of walking in Rome, we did over 6 miles in one day. If you decide to try and get a cab from the hotel to the downtown area it will cost you anywhere from 10-15 euro. Try to have exact change or smaller bills on you, as communication and making change can sometime be difficult.

The hotel is a converted house, I noticed a previous review stating that they could hear noise through the thin walls, we didn't have that problem. We had a very early flight out of Gatwick and therefore arrived early but we were allowed into room. Daniel greeted us and couldn't have been more helpful. He offered to cook us breakfast or said we could help ourselves, choice of break toast, jams etc. The room was beautiful, tastefully furnished, comfortable beds. The room was light with 2 huge window looking out onto the quiet street. It was incredibly relaxing and after a busy few days in Rome you need to come back to a peaceful haven. Daniel, member of staff, gave us all the info we needed, bus routes, best hotels to eat etc and told us which buses to catch and where to catch them. He really couldn't have been more charming and helpful. We were straight off into Rome, the most beautiful city I have ever been to. There are many restaurants in central Rome but after getting the bus back to the Palm Gallery we just wanted to go somewhere close and within walking distance. As it is a residential area it is so quiet which was just what we wanted but luckily there are a lot of family run restaurants within 5-10 mins walking distance, no tourists, just Italian families which we loved ( check the list that the hotel give you as we went to a very expensive fish restaurant on the first night and all we wanted was a plate of pasta, although it was a nice place). When we got back from all our walking on the first night, and it was dark and we were exhausted, Louisa, the owner was at the front door to greet us.

I choose to focus on the hotel services. Because we were at the end of a month-long journey thru Europe, we were tired and were late in making a reservation for our last stop before heading home. 2 days before arriving in Rome we sent an email to the hotel to inquire about reservations. Luisa responded immediately and said that she did not have 5 nights available, however she could put us up for 2 nights and could reserve a room at another hotel close by who happens to be a friend of hers. She would handle everything for us including a pick up at the train station, booking at the Palm Gallery and the other hotel, and transfer to the other hotel when we move. I have travelled extensively throughout the world and I have never, ever received such a comforting response. In most cases, we would have received a \"Sorry, Not Available\". However, Luisa made the effort to book us in her hotel AND take care of the rest of our stay. She even paid the the other hotel up front without having collected a penny from us. Daniel picked us up at the train station right on time and whisked us to the hotel with no problems. Luisa and her staff were so helpful in orienting us on public transport that by the 2nd day in Rome we could pretty much get to wherever we needed by using their maps and instructions. Our only regret is that we didn't reserve earlier because we were so sad to leave the Palm Gallery! The \"other' hotel (the Villa Morgagni) turned out to be a very nice 4 star hotel which was even more convenient to public transport. Even though it was comparable it just didn't have the same \"vibe\" and welcome as the Palm Gallery Hotel. Our stay was too short but we would like to thank Luisa, Daniel, Vincenzo, and the rest of the staff for making it so enjoyable.

The terrace is extremely relaxing before or after the inevitable long, hot walk in Rome. Our room was huge compared to what we've come to expect in Europe. The room had high ceilings, a nice cross breeze, and great natural lighting. The AC worked when needed and the amenities were also a nice touch (crisp dry towels, high-quality tolietries, etc.).

I stayed in 2 rooms, one a double and the other to accomodate a third travel companion. Both rooms were spotless and comfortable. Breakfast was something to look forward to, either in the cheery breakfast room or outdoors on the patio. The free wi-fi and free use of notebooks during our stay made getting in touch easy.

There are buses to the key sites, and the nearest metro is about a 15 minute walk away. We also cabbed from the city at around ten euros.

The fabulous service continued throughout our stay. Luisa has put together a great staff in Daniel, Lorenzo, Vincenzo, Farukh and others. They are all friendly, personable and outgoing, and honestly, cannot do enough for you. These guys really go over and above in terms of service, hunting down English-language newspapers for guests, making restaurant recommendations, playing host, bartender, concierge and chauffeur all in one. They make staying here really feel like home. The rooms at the Palm Gallery are lovely too. Very clean, nicely appointed and with very comfortable beds (which for Europe, can be a stretch). I loved the hotel's location; residential but well within striking distance of all major attractions either on foot (Borghese Gallery), by bus (Pantheon, Vatican) or metro (Colosseum is only 4 stops away).

I spoke to the staff manager Daniel. He was very polite & when I finalized my booking I received the confirmation in an hour. The day we landed we were received at the Airport by a smart warm Italian gentleman named Stefano. The ride to hotel was nice in a spacious van. On arriving at the hotel we were warmly welcomed by Luisa the owner. She offered us the red Orange juice & some snacks. We spent some good time at the porch + terrace they have. The hotel is spotlessly clean & fresh with flowers in the gardens. The neighborhood is calm quite worth every penny to get some peace after a hectic day in Rome. The rooms are big for European Standards & the ceiling is oh so high 3 Metres. The Cozy Room is best for couples with limited baggage & usually we travel light. The breakfast is good & dont miss the Orange juice which is red in color. There are fruits available & if you have any special needs just ask Luisa. The hotel staff is so polite & humble you would think you have never left home. Lorenzo, Daniel , Luisa & the staff make sure you have everything you need & more. You can disturb them anytime & they will always have a smile on their face & tend to you with warmth. They will bid you Ciao when you leave for the day & then arrive back again. The square near the hotel Piazza Caprera has a nice fountain where you can stroll at night for a walk before you hit the sack. It has nice eating options , the one in Villa Torlonia has a pizza & Tiramisu best ones we ever had. There also a Thai restaurant nearby which is also pretty nice. The Restaurant Villa Paganini is a little extravagant & not for vegetarians(we wrongly chose to eat there but it seems to be a fish eaters paradise). MY BIGGEST TIP IS BUY A ROMA PASS. (Recmnd by Trip Advisor Also) Its worth 25 Euros as you can get to Colosseum & Forums & Galleria Borghese for free. 12 Euro for Colosseum & Forums + 8.5 EUR for Galleria Borghese and you can travel for 3 days until midnight of the third. ( you will need to reserve the entrance in advance by calling but just show the Roma Pass at entrance) . Use the Roma Pass for two sites which are paid & you want to visit. Your best bet towards town is bus 62 from Via Nomentana , 88 & 80. These are very near the hotel & 62 is spot on for Piazza Venezia , you can walk to Colosseum. It also travels on Via Del Plebiscito which your best bet back too & also for Pantheon , Trevi Fountain. Just visit www.atac.roma.it and use it in English with proper dates & time. It will give you routes for all the busses. Use Via Nomentana 2nd Stop for the hotel. Always keep two maps at hand in case you need it. Ask Luisa for 2 of the maps she always has , a map of nearby hotels & a map of nearby bus stops.

This hotel is based just outside the city center and in a really nice neighborhood. Do not be put off that it is just outside the middle of Rome, for us this was a true bonus.... you actually want to escape the noise and buzz of the city. It is so easy to get back in, the number 80 bus stop is a 4 min walk away and that bus comes every 3 mins and in 5 mins you are there in the middle - it was so easy. (nb there are many other buses to also chose from and the metro - no more than 5 -10 mins walk away) On our first day we actually walked from the hotel all the way to the Spanish Steps through Park Borgase - again no major effort and shows how well placed the hotel is. The hotel itself is simple but classy. The room was lovely with a great shower. The only disappointment was that the double bed was in fact two single beds pushed together, not sure if this is the normal in Italy - but might be worth checking when you book. There is a lovely sunny terrace where you can have your coffee outside. The breakfast was nice - very simple - but more than adequate for such a hotel, you will not be disappointed. So our tips to a trip to Rome : 1. Stay in this hotel - it really is great value and far better than staying in the middle of Rome 2. Ask the wonderful Luisa for her maps. She really does have a map for every adventure and she is really very helpful 3. Get a good map of Rome before you start. We made the mistake of not doing this and got confused and lost - then we got one ! 4. Do not buy drinks in the center of town. We walked just a little towards our hotel and instead of 9 euros for a small peroni, we paid 3 euros for a large peroni. The difference in price was shocking, don't fall into the tourist trap - always check the menu before you sit. 5. We bought bread, salami and cheese from supermarket and had picnic for lunch each day - SO much cheaper and just as nice 6. Don't buy anything from the kiosks outside the main tourist attractions - they are ridiculously over priced 7. When you go to Collesum , buy your ticket from the entrance to the Forum (just 200 meters down the road). There was a 45min queue to buy ticket at the Col and we had got this tip from Trip Advisor - there was zero queue at the Forum. The same ticket lets you into both sites. Once you have your ticket, you walk straight into the Col. This was the TOP TIP ! 8. The Vatican Museums was great - but we only spent an hour or so there. Still don't miss it for the Sistine Chapel. 9. On the Saturday we went for a day trip to Pompei. Totally doable and so worth it. We left on the 8.27 train (went on the cheap one which was 10.50 euro and 3 hours, but it was fine (we read a book!) then at Naples, look for the Circumstavia signs for the local train - you can get the ticket for that train there - and 30 mins and you at Pompei. The train drops you to the front door. 3 hours at Pompei was more than enough and we were back in Rome by 7pm. (once again we were organised and took a picnic) 10. Get the 116 Bus to Travestre. It is a great way to see the back streets of Rome !! 11. Do not spend any time at all near Termni train station. it is a simply horrible place full of tramps and dodgy people. So relieved that we didn't stay in that area. Overall we had a great trip and staying in the Palm Gallery Hotel certainly made it relaxing and comfortable.

Louisa, the owner, is a fascinating and caring host, and Daniel and the other young men were always attentive and helpful.

From the moment we arrived at the train station, where Giancarlo, one of the owners, promptly picked us up and drove us to the hotel, it was pure heaven. Upon arrival, Giancarlo showed us to our room on the first floor. It was a cozy room with a queen bed and a nicely appointed bathroom, including, as others have mentioned, L'Occitane products. The bed was very comfortable, which was a welcome change from the hotel where we had stayed the previous 7 days in Sant Agnello on the Sorrentine Coast. The room was nicely decorated, too, and one could definitely tell that care went in to the decor, not only in the room, but throughout the entire place. We did not have the pleasure of meeting Luisa, Giancarlos wife and other owner, but I had several e-mail contacts with her and she is such a gem. She even reserved a table three weeks in advance of our arrival at a restaurant that we wanted to try in the Garbatella neighborhood of Rome (anyone an Anthony Bourdain fan?? We ate at the place featured in his \"Rome\" show, called Il Timoniere-the BEST carbonara ever). We were very sorry not to meet her in person. After dinner at Il Timoniere, we went back to the hotel, where Giancarlo served us a wonderful bottle of sparkling reisling and joined us on the terrace for a long conversation. What a lovely host. You definitley feel like family when there. We even met his lovely daughter, Marcella. If you are looking for a quiet neighborhood, a charming hotel, and an incredible staff, this is THE place to stay. It is easily accessible to the center of Rome via bus or metro. We took the metro, which was only a ten minute walk (Policlinico stop). Also, the breakfast is quiet good, with cheeses, meats, pastries, and yogurts. Of course, the coffee is great!! The best part, for those who do not like to rise too early when on vacation, is that the breakfast lasts until noon. One last point is that both of us are travel buffs, and have been all over the world. We have stayed in Rome before in 4 and 5 star places. This is definitely the best.

The room was clean. The neighborhood was great . There was a beautiful reading balcony, where one could choose to unwind with a book after a hectic day. For those who reach termini station, to reach the hotel take bus no. 38 (buy the ticket from the newspaper stand) and drop off at the 8th stop, then you need to walk a bit (just take a map of Rome from the airport or termini station). But, I am not writing this review and praising the hotel for all these. Another good hotel would provide you the same or similar.

They have ten guest rooms but, the attention you receive is so over the top you feel as if you are their only guests. Other guests that we met there were also very pleasant and friendly. You feel like a family! The guest rooms are nicely appointed, clean and like everything else personalized with Luisa's special touches.

She was right! They took such good care of us. What a great team! The restaurant suggestions were great - especially liked walking to Pepe Verde and passing the fountain after a nice meal and a quiet stroll through the neighborhood. Giancarlo even got us information of a nearby catacomb and a ride there in his personal car. Thank you Tony for going out of your way to try and retrieve a lost jogger. You are right Daniel...do not leave without ID or hotel information. Now what hotel have you ever stayed at with this kind of personalized service? It was genuine and from the heart. Loved all the pets too! This was our third trip to Rome and by far the BEST, mainly because of our stay at the Palm Gallery.

It\u2019s a nice change to see breakfast served until 12 noon too! Even if you miss breakfast the staff are quick to offer you free pastries/coffee/water. This in itself is a nice change to the usual 4 euros per bottle from most hotel mini bars! The place is situated in a beautiful residential area so no noise from tourists or traffic. There is a gorgeous park just up the road and also some fab restaurants right on your doorstep if you don't fancy venturing into the tourist area of Rome. The place is situated 1.3 miles from the Spanish Steps but I think this is as the crow flies. When walking there it took a good hour on foot. But we didn't mind this at all as you pass numerous fab cafes, buildings and even the remainder of the old roman walls as you head to the main sights. It was great weather so a lovely walk and we felt we needed it after taking advantage of the amazing pasta on offer at the local Villa Paganini restaurant. The hotel is a recently refurbished villa and no expense has been spared. Our room was amazing - fab authentic furniture which must have cost a fortune alone! Our en-suite bathroom had a wonderful jacuzzi shower with jets coming out wherever you wanted! The best shower I've ever had to be honest with plenty of hot water. This place is the perfect mix of authentic Italian accommodation mixed with luxurious mod cons. Soft bed linen and fresh towels everyday. Plus the place was absolutely spotless. There's clean but this place was amazingly clean. A true pleasure to stay here and we would recommend it without hesitation. The owner was on hols but in her absence the staff were so friendly and couldn't do enough for us. It sounds a little corny but it was as easy to sit and chat with them (the outside terrace was lovely) like we'd known then ages! I understand that by this time next year they also hope to have installed a lift and a cafe type place downstairs. There are also plans for an outside jacuzzi - this place is gorgeous but has plans to become even more fab! We would definitely return. The only small thing that has stopped me from giving this place top marks is that unfortunately our room was right next to the neighbouring room so it was quite noisy if someone was arriving or leaving (or if the room was being cleaned). But this was only for a few minutes usually and so although we had broken sleep most mornings we simply nodded back off to sleep and took advantage of the hospitality later!

The kids loved staying there and playing with her dog, her cats and her two free roaming turtles in the garden. In fact, when a relative asked one of my kids what his favorite part of our three week trip to Italy was, he answered the Palm Galley Hotel and Rosalba and Hugo (the turtles).

The rooms are impeccably clean, the beds very comfortable, and the toilet was spacious and clean as well - there were even L'Occitane products for us.

What was amazing too was that the staff even prepared fruit-smoothies for my children at breakfast, catered to their personal preference. Advice about tourist attractions were not just verbal, but even included peronalised maps printed with buses that directed us to and fro from the hotel.

Luisa offered to help us find a room for our last night without our asking, such that we could go around Rome without having to worry about finding an accomodation for the last night. Secondly, when we were to move to the next hotel after our last night, the assistant Manager, Daniel, offered us a ride to our next hotel even though it was out of his way driving to the airport at no charge at all.

Our room was spotless with nice towels & toiletries, hairdryer, dressing table for SWMBO, flatscreen TV, fridge & safe etc. PG is in a quiet residential area with several good local restaurants. Only visit the nearby fish restaurant if you have lots of money! It was the most expensive meal of my life and not worth the expense. Luisa provides walking maps showing routes around local places of interest, and is more than happy to chat & give advice on any aspect of your visit to Rome. The Roma Pass is well worth buying. If we ever return, we should be happy to stay here again.

There are many nice restaurants in walking distance of the hotel for dinner. I would describe the place as more like a bed and breakfast or a pensionne than a hotel, it's more informal and home-like than a regular hotel. The furnishings are first class though. Also, there is a slight degree of disorganization which is not enough to be a problem, but you may want to double check things. For example, we had arranged for a drive to the airport but the van was not there at the prearranged time, so a taxi was called instead and we got there in time but it caused a little panic.

Also, be sure to enjoy the outside garden area if it's not too hot; relaxing place to sit and talk. The only complaint I have is that it could be difficult to achieve quiet or privacy sometimes. With the combination of occasional construction in the hotel and neighbor noises along with with thin room doors that do not insulate sound, quiet and privacy were usually hard to come by. The location is not really central to many attractions, although if you learn the bus and subway system, you can get anywhere you need without much walking. I recommend you learn this system early.

She gave great directions and travel advice and went out of her way to help in every possible manner. The hotel is in a charming old neighborhood with a lovely garden and patio. Newly opened, this is her first venture into running a hotel and based on our experience, she found her calling. It is kind of a work in progress-the hotel is finished, but she is working on converting a ground floor area into a cafe and wine bar. Health and spa area almost finished. I am sure thye will be fantastic when she gets completed. Be sure to visit with her dog, cats, turtles during your stay. They are all part of the family. Now get this-I hesitate to mention because all you people will expect the same treatment. Louisa drove us to the rental car place at the train station and went in with me to make sure we were taken care of. We would have been hosed without her since they didn't have the car we reserved and we needed a larger van to fit all the people and luggage. She helped negotiate for a larger vehicle at the same rate with the guy in Italian. She then drove back with us to the hotel to make sure we didn't get lost and had one of her guys drive back her car Anyway, you get the idea.
