No lift though, so go to the gym and work out before you arrive, or pack light! Lots of places to see around there and lots of places to eat. So close to the train station too so you can arrive from the airport train and walk over. The rooms do the job and are clean. I got a deal with a breakfast too which is simple but keeps you going. Friendly staff: one who speak more english worked mostly in the afternoon and evening so if you have questions, approach him then. Stayed there on a very tight budget and couldn't afford the extra 10Euro for the air-con. On the hottest night i was there, he offered me the air-con for free.

The temperature during our stay in Rome was in the high 20s with high humidity so we couldn't manage without aircon and reluctantly agreed to this additional charge. However, I emailed our booking agent to (politely) ask if this was standard practice and got a reply the next morning saying that it was a mistake and that there would be NO extra charge for using the airconditioner during our stay and the price as quoted on our booking sheet was correct. We arrived on the weekend and I think that the person working reception didn't really know what they were doing, so I'm glad I checked with our booking agent. When we went out on our first day and returned to the hotel around noon, this same person told us we had to 'go away' again because our room hadn't been done yet and the cleaners were having lunch! We eventually got him to understand that we didn't mind if they came in while we were there, but this was clearly something he'd never come across before and he really wanted us to go away. Once the regular weekday staff were on, everything was fine and we found them to be quite helpful even though the language barrier was a bit hard to negotiate at times. But we managed with my little bit of Italian and their little bit of English to mostly make ourselves understood. Our room although small, was adequate, clean and fully serviced with clean sheets and towels daily. Breakfast was disappointing with just a croissant, a fruit juice drink, the usual dry rusk type bread and jam. We asked if we could have English Breakfast tea, but that was clearly beyond them and every morning we got Earl Grey tea bags - one each. Luckily we found a supermarket where we were able to buy some tea that we both like so we used those instead of theirs. The milk provided was hot and 'fluffed' as though for a cappuccino, but at least the water was properly hot. This was a surprise bonus as we'd found it hard to get really hot water anywhere else. The Meridiana is situated very close to everything, only about a 10 minute walk to the main station where you can catch local buses or the Hop On/Off buses that take you to all the main tourist destinations. I've read some really dreadful reviews about this hotel, but I think the secret is to realise that a 2 star establishment isn't going to give you much luxury and once we cleared up the misunderstanding about the air conditioning, we quite enjoyed our stay here. Because we didn't make a fuss and were always polite to the staff, we found them very willing to provide us with good service. We overhead some other guests getting really aggro because the WiFi wasn't working and they were implying that it was the receptionist's fault when it was clearly a technical problem and was probably corrected a bit later on. I really can't see the point in treating people rudely just because something isn't going your way. The golden rule is to treat others the same way as you like to be treated.

So if you are considering booking any hotel in this area its probably not going to be great. The lobby is located on the second floor of the hotel. The room my friend and I booked was supposed to have two twin beds, however we entered the room to see a queen bed and what looked to be a twin size bed. We then opened the windows and our room looked out into the back of a large, rundown apartment complex. I recommend not even opening the blinds if your room is on the back side of the building. At night it gets loud (again I can only speak from living in a room on the back side of the building) and in the morning you can hear just about anything move outside or above your room. The shower did not drain well and sometimes flooded although that tends to be the case around much of Europe. Also, there is no internet available in our room although there was an internet cafe around the block. The man at the front desk was pretty helpful for the most part and the hotel was in a good overall location, in terms of proximity to metro station and the coliseum. The staff at the hotel also allowed us to keep our bags at the hotel while we went sightseeing given our flight wasn't unti 9 P.M. There was always someone at the front desk as well which made us feel safe about leaving our room for long periods of time. This hotel was nice but I feel like there are better hotels out there that can offer better amentities. However, this is a good hotel for the amount we paid.", "Date": "May 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cGood location; bad hotel\u201d", "Author": "Estrella91", "ReviewID": "UR55235164", "Content": "This hotel is without doubt the worst I have ever stayed in, and I'm one of those people that always makes the ebst of things in hotels. Got there in the middle of the day to be told we'd have to wait four hours for the rooms to be ready. We were travelling in a large group of around 30 (school trip) and were split into 10 rooms. Each room was incredibly small, and rather dirty, but did have a fridge and a safety deposit box which we didn't have to pay for, but no air conditioning which we HAD paid for. Our shower door in the bathroom was broken, and wasn't fixed so we kept having to go next door to shower in our friends' room. The room was on the bottom floor with a large window that the maid kept leaving open even when we asked not to so anyone could have gotten in; luckily nothing happened though. We were staying there as a B&B and the breakfast food was terrible! It was just rolls, jam and bad fruit; no cereal or even a toaster. Rome itself though is amazing. The location of the hotel is fab for walking to the all the main attractions, although you probably will need to get a bus to the Vatican as that's quite a bit away. The bus service is very good though. Just beware of pickpockets in the streets and men hassling you to buy fake goods.

No breakfast or breakfast room exsisted, as we were told it did on the booking reservation. Only down side: - On arrival we informed the reception that we would be paying by credit card - They agreed it was fine. The day before we were checking out, we went to pay and they informed us the credit card machine was broke. And then decided they dont accept credit cards. The manager became quite heated with us and requested cash. We refused and insisted we would pay in the morning on check out with credit card.

In the end they gave us 10 EUR... Despite the showers not having worked the next morning our room was miracoulosly not ready yet and when I mentioned this they offered again the room without water! I'm sure there was no room without water at all. The room appeared to be nice once we could finally move into it but painfully small. Breakfast delivered to the room?? Well, we were taken to a small bar in the next street where we received our croissant and the worst cappuccino I had in Rome. On top of that I couldn't leave my luggage there until 6 in the afternoon because the guy who was at the reception only worked until 4pm!! And as someone else also mentioned credit card was not accepted so in the end we had to bring some cash. Rome is a lovely city but if you get treated like this at your accommodation (which by the way is one of the most expensive in Europe - I mean where else do you get a room at a 2-star hotel for 130 EUR???) it can really give you some headaches...
