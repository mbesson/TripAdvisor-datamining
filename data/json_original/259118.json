We checked out after a few hours - we just couldn't handle the odors. In the lobby they have large fans set up to try and dry out the carpet and get rid of the musty smell. I think that smell has been there for a very long time and is not leaving that easily. Our room was on the 5th floor, and the hallway had a different smell. A cross between mildew and gym locker. The room: First of all, they give you 2 actual metal keys. One for the deadbolt, and one for the door handle. Seriously. When we walked in, there was an overwhelming smell of bleach and the tile was wet. I always bring a container of Lysol wipes with me, and headed straight to the bathroom to clean it. Wow is all I can say. Apparently, the staff pours bleach on the floor to make guests think the room has been cleaned. Trust me, that toilet was not touched for a very, very long time. I used the entire container to clean a small bathroom. The rest of the room was just grimy and never really cleaned. There was a bobby pin on the carpet in the living room, and when I touched the bedside lamp I almost cried from the slime on my fingers. The furniture and fixtures are cheap and old. I felt sorry for the newer tv in the armoire, it didn't deserve to be there. The hotel itself is completely outdated - think 1960's - and run down. It was like a really bad summer camp for grown-ups. I think they are trying to renovate it, but it needs a complete remodel.

This year we thought it was about time we check out the place where all our maintenance fees go to! Even though we have been receiving newsletters about the many \"renovations\" that have been going on at the Americano, we were concerned with negative reviews we read on Trip Advisor. In making our reservation I mentioned this to the rep and she was glad to put in a request for a \"renovated room\". Upon our arrival some of the issues we read about were true: there was a moldy, musty odor as you entered the lobby and the furniture, decor and lighting were out-dated, of poor quality and not appealing at all. (Later on we had a discussion with the front desk manager who explained that the odor comes from guests who walk through the lobby dripping wet from the pool or the beach and it is a constant source of moisture. They put floor drying fans around to help dry it out. The decor in the lobby is of low priority because they are concentrating most of their efforts on individual room renovations.) Our room did have new curtains, bedding, and mattresses but the carpet always felt damp and the room divider doors did not work properly. We had a beautiful view of the beach and the pool but were disappointed with the lack of a balcony. The AC unit only seemed to cool off the bedroom and not the sofa bed area - suggestion: a simple fix would be to add a ceiling fan over the living room. The kitchenette was smaller than what we have seen at other timeshares and some of the cabinets did not close well. The bathroom was in good shape although we noticed a constant odor from day one. The tile work looked out-dated but everything worked properly and showers were satisfactory. (We learned later on that all the tubs had been resurfaced recently) Although the housekeeping staff was quite friendly on the phone and at the towel exchange room we found dust and sand around our TV in the armoire. They also insisted on using their walkie-talkies at the highest volume outside our door on check-out day. Even with our late check-out request they made noise and banged on our door early in the am. Also, we were harassed by \"member services\" every morning about 8 am by phone to ask when they could set up an \"in-room\" survey appointment. We explained we arrived late the night before and were sleeping in but they insisted on calling back the next day. I explained that we were not comfortable having anyone in our room for a survey as we were all spread out and trying to relax in our room. The rep was rude and obnoxious and evasive when I asked why this was so important. They finally left us alone after 3 days of constant phone calls. I complained to the front desk and they said although they are not affiliated with \"member services\" they would pass along a message to them that they were disturbing us. They also suggested we fill out a comment card so that it would be in writing. We did that and turned it in. In spite of all that, I would have to say the most positive experience was from the front desk staff and their manager. We were greeted with a smile when we checked in late at night and was assisted with the automatic door so we could bring in our luggage. It was a speedy and polite check-in process. During our stay other issues came up and the front desk was apologetic and willing to help in any way they could. Even the manager took about 20 minutes of her time to discuss with us how they are working hard every year to try to renovate/update this old resort. They are accessing each room and prioritizing any issue that needs immediate attention. Almost all now have new curtains and bedding as well as the resurfaced tubs. They are also working on re-opening a convience store on property to provide guest with items they may need in their room, such as coffee, sugar, milk,etc. (something we needed during our stay, instead of driving down the road for) Even though the Tiki Bar was a great themed eatery for lunch or dinner it was still a \"bar\" atmosphere and not as \"family friendly\" feeling. It would be nice to see the \"Bistro\" re-open to have a casual eatery for breakfast or lunch. We were told it was run by an outside company who closed it down and the resort had no control over it. We enjoyed our time at Daytona Beach and visiting with relatives in the area. This is what makes it such a great location for our family but we would like to see more progress made with the renovations when we return in the future.", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Martinez, Georgia, United States", "Title": "\u201cIt was pretty good.\u201d", "Author": "Jesse G", "ReviewID": "UR135078053", "Content": "This is my second time I've been here, and it has gotten better.

It has some nice rooms, though the smell from just walking in it was so bad, we had to spray some fragrance to actually make it bearable. The beds were comfortable, the couch was also comfortable, and the TV was nice to look at, too. The outdoor pool was amazing. The temperature was just right, and the pool is very wide open so many people can swim in it and have fun. It's really deep, too, about up to ten feet, maybe more. The indoor pool is basically intended for kids so they can swim in a shallow pool. I wasn't able to be in the hot tub, though, because I was too young to be in it (18 and older to be able to step in it.) My parents wouldn't go to the restaurant and tiki bar, but it smells really good just being outside of it, smells like their grilling hamburgers. :) What was better is that right when you leave the restaurant, you are near the entrance to the beach. The lobby seems crowd until you go farther down the lobby, it seems so empty, because the bar is always closed, maybe due to rearranging and all that, but the TV at the bar is always on which is weird.

It was truly a different place this year- felt more like a hotel than a resort! Definetly will miss the activities!!! But I will continue to go 27th week because of the bonds of the families that all go the same time each year. Also, this year the resort has \"gone green\" and are limiting towels and linen exchange days. I totally understand protecting our planet but I find there are other ways to go green than being a towel warden! Also, there are now laundry hours- so no more washing clothes at night- isn't that supposed to be the cheapest time of the day to wash and dry clothes?(speaking of going green!) The pool deck this year looked rough and the pool did not seem to be cleaned daily as it was in the past. Also, there was smoking allowed by the pool and no ash trays around the pool and people left there cigarette butts and ashes around the pool- disgusting!

The rules were also very authoritarian, as Americano's \"brown book\" stated that we had to put the dishes in the dishwasher upon check-out and have every item inspected, as if we were moving into a campus dormitory. Even worse, the water was shut off for some emergency reason at 11 AM during the second morning of our stay; the elevators reeked of bad seafood odor; and the on-premises convenience store was never open.

Then there's Mike, the desk manager, who is rarely at the desk when you need him...overall, not good...we will never return, and we will let Interval know what a poor choice this place is for a timeshare exchange.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cWasn't sure what to expect, but despite a few complaints, we'd return to Americano Beach Lodge Resort.\u201d", "Author": "dalejrfan14", "ReviewID": "UR115201109", "Content": "We just returned from the Americano Beach Lodge Resort & after reading a lot of the reviews prior to our trip, we weren't sure what to expect. Despite a few complaints, we had a nice vacation & would return again. Here are just a few pros/cons you may want to consider before booking your vacation there. Guest staying at the Americano was like one big family. Many of the people we talked to had been staying there for over 20 years. Everyone was very friendly, but it was like we were attending a huge family reunion...in fact, it felt like we were attending a continuous party for 7 days. There was a lot of drinking & loud music...we like to have a good time, but it was a little un-expectant & at times a bit inappropriate. But, we did attend the week of July 4th & I'd say that is their busiest time. I talked with a lady on the first day that had spent the previous week at the resort & she said the previous week had been very quiet. So in all fairness, I\u2019d say that the partying isn\u2019t as bad at other times of the year. The pool areas were nice & the resort offered lots of activities for children & adults throughout the week. One negative was that adults had to wear poor bracelets anytime they were at the pool...needless to say; trying to tan with a black silicone bracelets was a bit uncomfortable. Another bit of advice, if you\u2019re going to the pool, put your towels out early in the morning or you will not get a chair. Many of the guests reserve their pool chairs for the day, even if they aren\u2019t going to be there. There were many days that we had to sit far away from the pool area all because the chairs were reserved for guests off doing other activities. The cleaning staff doesn't knock themselves out to get the room spotless...we had to wipe down the kitchen walls, etc. before we put our stuff out. Little areas, like the underside of the soap dish in the shower/bath had mildew on it (very obvious when you are giving a little one a bath) & the toilet rim had not been cleaned. Our biggest complaint was that the AC unit had mold growing in it! We didn't notice this right away, but when we went to adjust the AC & bent over to look closer, you could see big clumps of mold growing on the inside vents. Also, our refrigerator leaked on the inside so every time we got something out of it, it was soaking wet. Despite these things, we made the best of the situation & had a great week. We didn't complain to the staff. Instead, we cleaned these things ourselves & lived w/the leaking fridge. For the money, Americano has a lot to offer & we would stay there again.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shelby Township, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cJust OK\u201d", "Author": "gotoing", "ReviewID": "UR108365411", "Content": "Located right on the beach, but about 2 miles away from any good restaurants or bars.

My parents have been owners for nearly 20 years, and speak highly of it year after year. We have traded their unit for weeks in Orlando and California at high end resorts, so I was concerned after reading the reviews that the Americano would be a huge disappointment. I was WRONG! Are there things that can be improved? Absolutely. But overall, we had a wonderful vacation, and really enjoyed our stay. Reasons to Stay: 1. Location. The Americano is right on the beach, and there is even beach access directly from the main deck. The Americano gives you a passcode and bracelets to monitor those actually staying at the resort from someone just wandering in from the beach. There are plenty of restaurants and shopping areas on the A1A strip. The Main Street pier (which is actually closed until the fall, but lots to see and do nearby) is probably only a 20-25 minute walk down the beach. 2. Beach view. At least from our room (we stayed in a Floridian) our bedroom faced the ocean. Our room did not have ceiling to floor windows like the Atlantic rooms, but there was something very calming about falling asleep to the waves every night and watching the sunrise in the morning. 3. Pools. This resort only has one outside pool, but it goes up to 10 ft!! Personally, I prefer this vs. resorts that have 5 pools that go to 4 ft. max. (at least 3 of which I would probably never get to anyways). There are a good number of lounge chairs on the deck. The indoor pool was comfortably warm, and we found ourselves in that one quite often, especially at night. There was also a kiddie pool, which my 3.5 year old went in from time to time. 4. The Staff. Like every resort there is always one or two that you question, but everyone was very nice and accomodating. My parents actually decided to stay an extra few days, and the staff worked it out so my parents could stay in the same room. 5. Comfort. One night during a thunderstorm, we found ourselves in the room next to the lobby sharing a bottle of wine, ordering chinese food and dancing to the jutebox. Simply put, whether you are indoors or out, it's a relaxing and fun place to be. Improvements: 1. The beds and pillows. Honestly, they were uncomfortable. Our discomfort could also be attributed to us sleeping with our window open every night so we could hear the sound of the ocean. Hopefully the new mattresses that were being delivered are better than their predecessor. 2. Some amenities in the unit need to be replaced. For instance, the fan unit above our stove was a bit rusty and some of the countertop appliances were a bit older. But everything was in working order, so it's really only an appearance issue. 3. I missed having a washer and dryer in the room (I traveled with a 3.5 year and 7 month old) but there is at least one on premises. Simply put, this is not a 5 star resort. It's simple and classic, but very usable and practical. The room itself was fine. It was clean (including the tub) and spacious. We had a flat screen in the living room. I am starting to believe that regardless of the stars a resort has, someone will always be unhappy. I understand that some complaints are legitimate, but there was nothing about my stay that would keep me from returning to the Americano.

It was awful. The weather was beautiful, and we had a great time being with three of our grown children (in their 20's), but the actual resort was terrible. We arrived around 7:30pm and were given, apparently, the last room available. The furnishings are doggy, the kitchen drawers, cabinets, and appliances are old, scratched and rusty, the very old televisions had screen damage, the bathroom wasn't exactly clean (a big clump of hair was sitting in the drain and the floor had hair and general dirt on it), and the bed had only a fitted sheet over the plastic-encased, very uncomfortable mattress while the cotton blanket had a 9\" hole in it. This was totally unacceptable for the amount of points that we had used, and compared to lovely resorts we had previously stayed during the same time period (spring break week). We complained, nicely, to the very cordial staff and were given another room the next afternoon (two staff members apologized for the room we were given..i.e. Oh, yea, room ###. We're really sorry we gave you THAT one.). The new room was a bit cleaner; at least there was a mattress pad and no obvious hair in the the bathrooms, but the above run-down conditions still existed. The overall feeling was that this resort is badly neglected. The indoor hot tub was a unpleasant and foamy green (and extremely hot), the pool deck area needed painting from the rusty stains so prevalent, and the interior hallways smell of the garbage from the mini-dumpster containers at the end of each corridor. YUCK! The fitness room, however, is very clean and nice. We were shocked to find NO screens in any window (quite the safety hazard, I would think). We knew that there were no balconies, but to not have a screen to at least bring attention to a potential fall hazard is an accident that WILL happen. The resort seems to be in a slightly \"seedy\" area. There is nowhere to go within walking distance, not that I would recommend walking around there, anyway.

I thought the bathrooms were a little dated, but they were functional. The rooms were nice and large. I had a two bedroom which had 1 large fridge with a freezer. The layout was similar to having two connecting rooms, which made it convenient so that guests in the other section has access to their own fridge, microwave, bathroom, and towels. There were three (3) televisions, one in each bedroom and one in the sitting area that was equipped with a sofa and chair. The bed was very comfortable (both king size) and the pillows were the best I'd ever used while away from home. The pool goes from 3ft to 10ft with plenty of pool chairs. There is a deck where you can sit down and look out on the ocean. To access the beach, you just punch in a code. This helps to prevent those who are not hotel patrons from using the hotels facilities. This made me feel very safe. Also, you can sit on the deck and look out into the ocean. This was especially relaxing for me. The hotel has a small arcade room where you can play arcades or shoot pool. Food This hotel does not have a full service resturant. There is a Bistro on site where you can get a quick breakfast sandwich, cereal, water, candy, chips, soda, and souvenirs. The staff in the Bistro was very helpful and didn\u2019t mind answering questions. The Bistro closes fairly early (3pm) then the Bar takes over. You are still able to order a little something to eat at this time if you wish. If you go down Atlantic Blvd (by bus its about a 10 minute ride) there are several restuarants such as TGIF, Ruby Tuesday's, McDonalds, and Red Lobster. Ordering in is expensive. A small cheese pizza and an order or wings from Papa John's is $20. I did not have access to a car while I was there and felt a bit handicapped in terms of being able to get around. However, there is a bus stop in front of the hotel. Most buses run on a 30mintue to 1 hour schdule so be prepared.

Speaking of the beach this timeshare is a little further down than the action which could be a good thing. There is much less traffic than further south, but there were no beach rentals (chairs, etc.) unlike further south. There is a small grill in the lobby with typical grill fare, but you would be better off cooking in your room. There is a small bar and they do have drink specials. The exercise room looks better in the pictures than it did in person. It is fairly small with a few machines and there were kids playing on them a lot of the time. There is an indoor pool and two hot tubs. The outdoor pool is very impressive. There is quite a bit of seating and sunbathing area. It was never full the whole time we were there. Unfortunately the way they built the wall around the pool area you cannot see the beach very well. Check out was kind of a hassle. There were about two hundred people leaving and there was only one poor employee on the desk. She was wonderful and worked her tail off, but it did take some time to get out.", "Date": "July 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cFamily Vacation/Wedding\u201d", "Author": "rday13", "ReviewID": "UR17165646", "Content": "Our stay at the Americano was excellent.

[----] My family stayed at the Resort last week and had the best time I have ever experienced in a hotel setting Thanx to the entire staff. What a fantastic crew...The staff went above and beyond the call to make our stay GREAT. My son and his fiance' were married on the beach in front of the resort and the help we got from the staff was Fantastic. Every question was answered and every problem was solved on the spot. With a smile! It is a great feeling when someone goes out of thier way to make you feel at home. William was our go to man for help with our party he helped us cleanup and went out of his way to make it easy. Cecelia I think is her name in housekeeping always had a smile was very helpful with getting anything we needed to have a comfortable stay. The front desk was so helpful with check-in and check-out procedures that we didnt even feel as though we were at a hotel we felt like we owned the place. When my wife and I return to Daytona that is where we will stay if they have the room . As long as I get the room with the pool and beach view:) Again thanks to the entire staff for all their help IT WAS A GREAT VACATION!!!!. I will recommend The Americano to anyone that asks me where to stay in Daytona. Its location is perfect for getting to the race track or Main street where the pier is. I had a blast fishing there. The grocery stores and rest. and shopping centers are even closer. Anyone looking needas to stay there.
