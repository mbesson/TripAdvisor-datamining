A gem in the heart of Sydney!\u201d", "Author": "Dan U", "ReviewID": "UR127840114", "Content": "I'm originally from Sydney, now living in Los Angeles. I haven't been home in some time but recently made the trip down under for my brother's surprise 40th birtday party. I decided to book a week at the Diamant Hotel in Potts Point primarily for the location - it really doesn't get much better - close to the city, Paddington & Darlinghurst, a short walk to the harbor foreshore (Rushcutters Bay) and 2 mins from Kings Cross train station and major bus routes. I actually used to live in Potts Point so am familiar with everything that part of town has to offer - aside from its central location, Potts Point (and neighboring Darlinghurst) has an army of cute coffee shops, restaurants, bars and shops.. a great place to base yourself in Sydney.. and that's coming from a local. So for roughly $200 a night, including a balcony/terrace I figured 'how bad could it be'. Well let me tell you, it wasn't bad at all, in fact it was downright GREAT! The Diamant Hotels boast a 'luxury boutique' hotel experience and that's pretty much what you get. The rooms are clean, modern and well sized. They include all the necessary ammenities - VERY COMFY BED, bath, shower, FREE internet and cable TV (these are the musts for me at least). The balcony is more a like a patio (huge) replete with outdoor furniture and most days I found myself sitting out there enjoying beautiful Sydney 'end of summer' weather. Not all the rooms have an outdoor area, but if you're willing to spend a bit extra its well worth it. The staff were super friendly and very accomodating. I can honestly say I enjoyed my stay there and will be on the look out for other Diamant Hotels (and other 8 Hotels for that matter) in my future travels. Look, if you want to be a typical tourist and spend fortunes on some generic big brand name hotels (Hyatt, Hilton) downtown then go for it, but if you want a more authentic Sydney experience, staying at a very cool, very hip and amazingly located hotel then look no further then the Diamant Hotel Potts Point.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marrakech, Morocco", "Title": "\u201cStaff very nice, good location but ....\u201d", "Author": "taftaf", "ReviewID": "UR127375487", "Content": "I stayed for 5 nights and can not give more than 2 stars first because of the price, when you charged more than 180 $ , you expected more The safe didnt work, the TV didnt work , i asked 2 times ti get shower gel etc..

We selected the hotel mainly based on the location as many of our friends live in the Potts Point area and the location is probably the only redeeming factor about this hotel. The first room we checked into smelt of mould and had a view of a brick wall so we asked to be moved. Thankfully the new room didn't smell and had some natural sunlight coming in. The hallways smelt really bad and you could tell they'd tried to cover the smell up by spraying lots of air freshener. It didn't work. As you can see by the photos that I've uploaded, the hotel is badly in need of a refurbishment - the curtains were coming off the rails, the shower was mouldy and the TV looked like it was fitted by amateurs. Worst of all the smoke detector was missing - in it's place was just the bracket where the smoke detector should have been attached. So, if you want a good location in Sydney but don't mind bad service, small smelly rooms or have any concerns about smoke/fire hazards then this probably the hotel for you!! If you check out my other reviews you will see I tend to give fair and balanced reviews - if a hotel is great I will say so but if it's bad then I will also say so!!! In other words, until this hotel has had a complete refurb, avoid at all costs.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gosford, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWow!\u201d", "Author": "TroyA1991", "ReviewID": "UR125171072", "Content": "Recently stayed at the Diamant Hotel for the weekend (Feb 18th/19th) with some friends to celebrated my 21st birthday.

The minibar was however automatic and we quickly found out that all spirits were missing. This was apparently some kind of mistake, and was corrected by the staff downstairs.

The corridors and rooms were fairly dark - suppose this is meant to imply 'sexiness'. We had a basic room which was fairly large including a massive bed. Everything felt new and modern. We asked for the minibar to be emptied so we could stash all our own Christmas drinks in it and they swiftly obliged. Polite and friendly staff also made the stay very pleasant. I've never stayed in hotel over Christmas before and there wasn't much of a Christmas vibe but then I didn't really expect it there to be. The atmosphere in the hotel was low-key and relaxing which is exactly what I wanted. There any amenities as such, there's no restaurant or lobby bar or gym or pool or anything at all really but for the price that was fine. You are surround by bars and restaurants and cheap cafes for breakfast and I think you could get a day pass for the gym next door should you wish. Don't be fooled by Potts Point mentioned in the address as it's right in the middle of Kings Cross. Kings Cross can feel a bit grubby and scary but was close to bars, restaurants, supermarket and public transport so I was actually pretty happy in this area.

Having lived in Sydney before we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t looking to be right next door to any of the major sights or attractions. We found the hotel via the Mr & Mrs Smith website, and had reasonably high expectations for a boutique hotel with a bit of personality. I think the chief issue at the Diamant is the expectation set versus the final execution. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to be both a boutique and business hotel. The service would have fallen short for us had we been there for business; the check-in time is already fairly late and unfortunately our experience was similar to other reviewers: Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long way from most places; you told us the check-in time, we arrived accordingly but were [unsurprisingly] tired, you seemed unconcerned and a bit gruff, we waited a good hour. Every query we put towards the front desk from that point on was treated in a similar manner; put to the end of a long list of tasks for various other guests. Fair enough, you're busy, but it would suggest you are therefore short-staffed. On the boutique scale of things, the rooms really fall down on their finishes. Aside from the lobby area, the hotel gives the conflicting impression of a building that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really completed as intended, or that the design was not robust enough to carry the daily wear and tear of being a hotel. Corridor light bulbs were out, as were the wall lights in the bedroom, cables dangled from behind the badly fitted wall mounted TV, and the glossy paneled walls of the room were badly scuffed from \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 well, being a hotel room that will see quite a few cases and bags rolled through it. The intention was to look slick, but the quick bruising made everything feel shabby. All in all, we came away feeling a bit stung on the pricing, and perhaps that the larger percentage of the rate was for location rather than service or amenity.

I decided to go back to bed now that i had cancelled the reservation.I woke up to find a voicemail left by the Manager herself asking me to contact the hotel in regards to my \"reservation\"? I called the hotel back and i spoke to the staff member who had actually made the reservation for me,i asked what was wrong and i had no reservation anymore that it was cancelled? The receptionist actually said to me that my reservation was made for the Thursday not for Saturday and that they would have to charge me a nights stay,which worked out to about $120 i tried saying to the receptionist calmly that i had booked my room for the saturday she was adamant that i booked it for the Thursday and i would have to pay anyway???? At this point i was FURIOUS! Why should i have to pay for someones mistake? I was then put on the phone to the Manager,she was also very adamant about the reservation being booked for the Thursday instead of the Saturday,and that she sends customers \"confirmation emails\" which in actual fact i never got if i had i would have rang the hotel and asked them why my my room was booked for Thursday (which is no good to me) and it wasnt booked for the Saturday?I asked the Manager what would have happened if i had shown up on the Saturday as planned and reserved according to me? She had nothing to say but to speak over me (very professional i say) I told her i was not going to pay for it she said that they were going to charge me anyway! As soon as i got off the phone with her i contacted my bank and they said that they had already tried to take the money from my account on the Thursday but thought it was a little strange as though this was not a direct debit of any sort that i had set up,which means that they could not access any money (im glad to have such a great bank)!!! Overall i have NEVER had a problem with any 5*hotel,and they always tend to be in more demand than a 3-4*hotel,i actually was very discouraged because i was looking forward to staying at this hotel,but now im VERY glad i didnt!

The room itself was very modern, appeared recently renovated, and had potential, but lacked the cleanliness that I would expect (for example, the dark carpets showed lint/dust everywhere, and did not look like it was vacuumed prior to my arrival and was not vacuumed the second night either). The toiletries were half used/not replaced when I arrived. The bathroom had no bathtub, and after a 15.5 hour flight from Vancouver, a tub would have been nice. Also, the shower stall only had a tiny strip separating it from the main bathroom floor and so the water pooled on the bathroom floor, even with towels placed on the floor. I also had to wait until the official check-in time for my room when I arrived. The hotel is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boutique\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which means no pool, but complimentary access to a Fitness First gym, just around the corner, was appreciated. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant was not open during my stay, either for breakfast or dinner. The internet access was $20 per day in the room, or $11 using the television internet (the latter I would definitely NOT recommend \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I purchased it for one day, but gave up after a futile 40 minutes trying to get my email). Complimentary access was available in the lobby, but you need to ask front desk staff for a personalized login and password. Front desk staff were friendly/helpful, but the hotel had no specific bellman or concierge. The television also had limited channels. The room refrigerator was full soft drinks, etc. and had no room for my own beverages. I had been familiar with the neighbourhood because of a previous visit to Sydney, so I knew what I was getting; but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the Kings Cross subway station was closed which made it inconvenient to get downtown/central business district or to/from the airport. I would not recommend this area to anyone preferring an upscale neighbourhood, shopping or seeking a hotel within walking distance to Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main tourist attractions, like the Harbour Bridge or Opera House.

The area that the Hotel is situated in could be classified as a bit \"seedy\" ..a typical Kings Cross connotation..however in our view Kings Cross is a minor factor in the big picture!.. if you are here for great restaurants, great walks, shopping, leisure then this is the place to stay. We did not enjoy the \"rougher\" area of kings cross ..but felt safe..and if you can see past all that then what you really get is a great lively buzzy atmosphere....and to be honest we were not at all bothered by the environment at all..we chose to stay here for it's vibrancy, and accessibility to great restaurants etc.. A taxi from the airport cost $40.00 and the Diamant is literally 200 metres from the train station so getting around Sydney was a breeze. A trip to Bondi Junction for shopping is a must...as is Bondi beach, Manly..etc Public transport is very good in Sydney and safe....a week transport pass is the cheapest way to get around if you intend to use the train, ferries etc a lot. The room was good...although could have been a little cleaner..(however as the decor and furniture is dark brown/black I understand it shows every mark! ) The Bathroom was compact and we found it a little claustrophobic but it was fully utilisable and the shower was good. ..The sound proofing from road noise/nightlife etc was pretty good..and air con worked well. It was a bonus to have opening windows also! The Bed was one of the best hotel beds we have ever stayed in ( and we are super fussy about this)..the linen was second to none and changed daily. The shampoo and conditioner were of the highest quality...I have never seen such a lovely product like this in a hotel before. The only minor gripe was that the rooms and corridors are dimly lit (I know it's the style they are after)....but the rooms were a bit dark at night if you wanted a good reading light you are out of luck... however we were ok with this. The Ipod docking station was excellent, the safe a standard size and storage was good. The fridge was small..but ok. The view was great considering the location...we got great Williams St views....spectacular at night! We felt safe in this hotel and believe it is the best of all the hotels in this area..we have stayed at a few and viewed many and the Diamant stacks up well against it's competitors! Unbeatable in this area! Front of house and concierge were good..Adrian was especially great to deal with! The other man was less friendly however the other staff were great. Our tips for restaurants/eateries..all located on Victoria St and very close to hotel Spice I am....the best Thai ever Malabar...very good Indian cuisine Wow Cow....frozen natural yoghurt....fabulous Messina....genuine and top quality Gelato.. Pizza...I think it was called Mad Pizza (or similar)...very good meals here. ..and many many more options for every budget. In the Potts point area we have a favourite breakfast cafe called Metrio...fabulous coffee, the best ever Mocha my husband has had and out of this world banana bread..it's also a great place to spot a few celebs on the weekend during brunch/lunch! All in all this hotel fitted the bill for us...With Sydney accommodation it can be a compromise between location and the need for atmosphere...the Diamant isn't in the Best location if you are after the central city area, however that area is dead at night and for us we walked to dinner every night, got a gelato at 10pm if we wished...all so close and handy....if we stayed in the CBD we would have not had such superb accessibility to our fave restaurants..it gave us the flexibility to pop out for dinner, go for a walk..then out for desser..,all with such ease...we think for a five days stay... Diamant was great and we would always stay here..so close to Darlinghurst and Potts Point..two upmarket ares....where we ventured for all our meals..and these areas are very classy.. There is also a Coles supermarket very nearby to the hotel with all you need snack wise, water, fruit.....there is also a little massage/reflexology place in the Supermarket entrance area..it's not at all flash but the staff are very good and it is very well priced. The gym that is aligned with Daimant is of high quality also! We also enjoyed many walks from our Hotel, down to the Botanical gardens and around the waters edge to the opera house..this is spectacular and the views etc are wonderful!.... In summary..we will be back if this place stays in a good price range...and continues to be well placed on tripadvisor....it's a great middle/upper range hotel with the basics we needed and in an unbeatable location for us.

Once we moved to our new room, we were instantly met with the bad smell of smoke again and the sound of people partying until 5 am.

He took us up to a shower room, gave us towels and shower gel so we could freshen up and even gave us an adapter so I could dry my hair!

The only thing is that you have to stand at the reception to use it. If you want to take it to your room I believe there is a charge for that. The only things I would say worth noting is that it is a good 20 minutes walk into the town centre. On the plus side you are very near the Kings Cross train station which can take you to the Harbour Quay (you need to change trains to do this). As for the area, it is known as a red light district, with bars/clubs catering for both gay and straight people. Having said this, the hotel is not on a street that this nightlife is particulary evident. The main excitement and diversity is on Darlinghurst road which is perpendicular to Kings Cross Road. I would say that the area is not nearly as bad as some people had made out to me before I went! Yes if you are looking for \"seedy adventures\" you will find them!

The King's Cross train station is a 2 minute walk from the hotel and a train to Town Hall station is less than 10 minutes. To get to Circular QUAY you will need to transfer to another train and take a few more stops. As for the rooms, I would say overall the other reviewers have described the rooms adequately. We did not experience a furniture problem and every thing in our room was clean and new. Our room was closer to the elevator and the door is not thick and so we would occasionally hear other patrons of the hotel, which wasnt a big problem.

The views out the window were nice, could see the Harbour Bridge, Opera House and until this morning Fort Denison in the Harbour. This was from a room on Floor 6. The wall mounted 42\" LCD tv just topped off the room. Nice 2 person shower and large bathroom, I hate others were you are cramped. Overall I would definitely recommend the Diamant and will stay there again.

On entering our requirements through the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stay long and save\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd link we achieved a 2.8% discount of $32 on an $1152 charge.

The online booking process was quick and simple and the welcome at the hotel was pleasant and professional. We arrived early, at about 10.00 o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122clock, intending to store our baggage pending check-in, we were offered and gratefully accepted immediate check-in. The room facilities met all of the promised facilities i.e. 2 x 42inch plasma TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (one in the lounge and one in the bedroom), DVD/CD player, bedside clock radio, bedside radio/iPod dock, extremely comfortable bed, good sized room safe, en-suite shower room with twin sinks and toilet, a good sized \u00e2\u20ac\u0153guest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd toilet off the dressing room area, ample wardrobe and drawer space, a well stocked mini bar that was emptied on our request so that we could use it as our own fridge and a city view balcony that was absolutely huge.

The mismatch of balcony furniture was a disgrace with both the wicker sofa and the mismatched stool being broken and unusable (a complaint resulted in two inappropriate chairs being supplied). The full-length window from the lounge to the balcony had a long crack in it. The attached \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Penny Lane\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd restaurant is acceptable without being remarkable.

I booked the room through the hotel website and paid 1,470 AUD for 7 nights. Internet in the rooms (Wi-Fi or cable) comes at 7 $/hour, 20$/day or 35 $/full stay.

The location is excellent, and one thing that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been mentioned yet is that within walking distance on William St. there are located at least ten car rentals.

I booked what I believed was the best room in the hotel, (The Courtyard Suite), for about $285.00. We arrived a couple of hours early to be told my a nice polite chap on reception that the room was not ready, no complaints there. The hotel is located about a 10 minute taxi from the CBD but has a number of bars and cafe's locally. We grabbed some lunch and returned at 3pm expecting to check in at the advertised time. We had to meet friends for and as such didn't have much time, and at 3.50pm the room was STILL not ready. I find this incredible considering the receptionist had said that housekeeping had started at 11.30am!!?? Having finally got our room key, I went in thinking well at least the room will be lovely... wrong. At first glance I noticed the very large crack in the window facing the courtyard which looked awefull when coupled with the dirty and fingermarked glass. It was then I noticed the marked leather furniture and brown stained carpet. We turned on the lights to find most of the light shades' broken and further dirty marks on the walls. The towell rail in the wet room was hanging off the wall and the shelf by the shower much the same, (a particular worry as this was glass). The only accessible sockets were located in the bathrooms, but due to a poorly designed wet area this meant that following a shower, my girlfriend was standing in a puddle of water while plugging in the hair dryer!! It doesn't take a genius to work out this is not a good idea. To add to the list the glass coffee table in the lounge was badly chipped, and a curtain was broken!!! The courtyard itself was huge and could be lovely if it weren't for the tired wicker furniture. There were no cusions and the sofa had exposed springs. The view however to the CBD was lovely, and the room has 2 large LCD TV's (however only the one in the bedroom worked). Despite the tone of this review, I really am quite easily pleased. I just can't stand it when hotels neglect to perform basic maintenence. I mean how much would it cost to replace the carpet, lamps, and get a handyman to fix the shelves?? We stayed in a $50 motel in Townsville that put this place to shame. The only good points are the size of the room and a very comfy bed. If I had had more time when I arrived I would have asked for another room. I don't know what the other rooms are like but I wouldn't recommend staying in the courtyard suite.

Oxford street, for those interested is about a 10 minutes walk. There is a very nice spa across the street I discovered called Zen Day Spa, you should check that out. There is a laundry and dry cleaning service at the hotel, but it is quite expensive, I suggest going to one of the local laundromat's down the street, much cheaper. There are many places to eat near the hotel including the Penny's Lane inside the hotel itself. It is pricey, but the food is terrific. Another convenience is the close proximity to the King's cross train station. A week pass run's about $45 dollars and I got my money's worth.

Even though it sits on the outskirts of the city, it is one of the noisiest hotels we've ever stayed at. There musts be a fire station near by and unfortunately the constant whirl of sirens kept us awake. The hotel falls down its service. It was one of those experiences where you feel like you are actually working rather than relaxing - constantly following up staff for things that should go without saying. For example, we booked a romatic package which, amongst other things, included chocolates on arrival. However, between our booking the package (at a reasonable premium on the normal room rate) and our stay, management had apparently decided that they no longer like the idea of the chocolates and so we would get none. Our first night was filled with a rather bizarre series of exchanges between us and hotel staff who, after two hours, called the hotel owner at home to see if they can just give us the chocolates from the mini bar. Surely such a schemozzles shouldn't happen over some chocolates. The breakfast from their Penny's Lane restaurant was very poor - best you go elsewhere. There are plenty of choices in Potts Point.

We went to Cairns, Gold Coast, and Sydney, and in each place, we stayed at a hotel/apt receiving a 4 1/2 rating on TripAdvisor. Out of the three hotels/apt, Diamant is by far the cleanest, and the most convenient. The Coles supermarket is right downstairs around the block and you can get everything from there. The Kings Cross train station is less than 5 mins walk away. With the AUD 5.20 City Hopper ticket, you are covered for the whole day whether you want to see the Opera House, or cross the Bridge to North Sydney to get a really nice picture of the Opera House and the Bridge. I did get warned by my Aussie friends about Kings Cross being the not so safe red light district. But honestly, I felt perfectly safe walking around at night (past 10 pm). There are a lot of really cute and nice restaurants/bars a block away. Walking there reminded me of the Village in New York City. Ask the people at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front desk. They make very good recommendations. BUT, make sure to call to make a reservation. For the recommended ones, especially on weekends, you either have to make a reservation, or prepare to have dinner past 9 pm. In terms of the service of the hotel, nothing extraordinary but good enough to make our 3-night stay very comfortable. As for pricing, I would suggest to book through the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own website. I checked around and compared prices when I booked ours. I got AUD 160 per night for District View Rooms (not sure about the difference but the rooms we got were very decent) directly from their website. Somehow the promotion was not too explicit on their homepage. I checked out a few options to get the AUD 160 price (the first price I saw for the same room was AUD 280 or something). Guess it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurt if the hotel can make the promotions more visible and easier to find by viewers. Lastly, bear in mind that the hotel does not have roller beds. So if you want to have one more person in the room, that person would either have to fit into a crib, or sleep on the floor.

Hip and contemporary, we preferred the customised privacy of this small boutique hotel to the lavish grandeur of some of Sydney's more stately landmarks.", "Date": "February 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "SydneyBrad", "ReviewID": "UR13310970", "Content": "I booked this hotel via Wotif.com as it was great value and 5 star for a weekend away.

Check-in was efficient and friendly. Staff at reception was always very kind and helpful when we asked about places to go, restaurants, etc. The rooms are great, very modern and stylish with large flat TV, DVD player and I-Pod docking station (loved that!) and a large very comfortable bed. It did not at all feel like staying at an office building. When we arrived the safe was not working, but that was fixed immediately. On NYE we had a bottle of spakling wine, flowers and a CD in the room which I found very nice. Also prices for things from the mini bar and internet were very moderate. Breakfast in the restaurant Penny Lane's was very good. First we were a little sceptical as there were not too many people in the restaurant, but we gave it a try and it was really good. They do not have too many things to choose from and you should not be in a rush as they prepare things freshly but everything we tried tasted really great and was prepared with best, fresh ingredients. If you look for a fast and cheap alternative for breakfast there is a Holiday Inn just around the corner where you can have the full brakfast buffet for less than AUD20. I did not like the location of the hotel too much, as I did not find the surrounding Kings Cross area too attractive....but a lot of interesting sites that you might want to visit are within walking distance and bus and train stops are also quite close. The hotel was really great and I would definatly go back there.", "Date": "January 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Will be Returning\u201d", "Author": "Niiki", "ReviewID": "UR11378133", "Content": "Recently stayed for a couple of nights and very pleased with this hotel. The rooms are very trendy and modern and the TV is huge. Check-in was efficient and friendly. Bed was really comfortable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an absolute must when we travel on business. I think that this is really Kings Cross and not Potts Point as advertised by the hotel, however, in saying that the location is excellent. It is a 2 minute walk to Kings Cross station and our stop (Town Hall) was only 2 stops away. There is a myriad of places to eat within close proximity and there is a Coles (for overseas visitors, this is a large grocery store) open until midnight every night. OK, the notorious area of Kings Cross is also just a short walk away, however, the area has really cleaned up and this just adds to the colourful scenery of the place! Couple of minor bad points: - Very expensive food on the room service menu (even in hotel terms) and quite limited as to variety. For a non-meat gnocchi dish, I think the price was around $30. - The servicing of the room was not done until after 3pm one day which was a bit of a pain as we had left in the morning for meetings and had to endure housekeeping servicing the room while we were there. We usually stay in the financial district of Sydney while on business, however, the value for money was hard to pass up and this will be on our preferred hotel list from now on.", "Date": "December 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "jcekola", "ReviewID": "UR11207407", "Content": "Stayed at the Diamant for 4 nights in November 2007. Overall it was a great experience and I would recommend it / stay there again. Everything is new and clean in the hotel although parts are still under construction. Can't beat the price for the luxury, we paid about $230 AUD per night. HIghlights: Location (we could walk to everything we wanted to see) Bed (king size, amazingly comfortable, loads of pillows, each night I slept sound, great duvet and sheets) Gym - you will just get passes to Fitness First which is in the building next to the Diamant, so much better than a usual hotel gym. Decor- everything is new, clean and pleasantly stylish Service - everyone was great & helpful, including bringing an entire first aid kit to the room within a minute or two after I cut myself shaving (even though i had only asked for a single bandaid, hahaha). Lowlights: Shower - the water pressure was nothing amazing and water had a tendency to leak out into the rest of the bathroom. Also, the toilettries are great but come in inconvenient bottles that seem to dispense either too much (shampoo) or too litte (conditioner). On the other hand, the bar soap has an amazing smell, I loved it. I didn't find the A/C unit very loud despite what a different reviewer said. A great experience overall and well worth the price.", "Date": "December 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cReasonable value in expensive Sydney ... definitely not 5 star\u201d", "Author": "BrysonFan", "ReviewID": "UR11171330", "Content": "Sydney is an expensive city, and the Diamant is a reasonable value for those who do not want to pay top dollar. Here's the skinny on the Diamant based on my recent stay: Overview: The Diamant is in an office building which has been converted into a hotel. It still looks like an office building ... except it has beds and showers installed in the rooms. The lobby looks more like a tiny waiting area than a usual hotel lobby. Concierge services are at the reception desk (no place to sit and no brochures on display). It is definitely not a 5* hotel, and not what I would call \"boutique.\" Pros: Price is reasonable for Sydney. Service is very good, although at the time I stayed here the staff was new & still coming up to speed. I expect that will improve over time. Location in Potts Point is good -- train and buses nearby which can take you to all the sites in Sydney, convenience shop across the street, post office a few blocks away, places to get something eat nearby. You can walk into the heart of things from here if you want, although it's a long walk. Beds are comfortable. Linen and towels of good quality (not deluxe but good). Broadband available in the rooms for an extra cost; there's a long desk facing the window. Flat-panel TVs in the rooms as well. In-room safe. Cons: Rooms are small, esp. the bathroom which is really too small for 2 people. No bathtub, just a simple shower which leaks water onto the rest of the bathroom floor. Not much room to dry your hair or put your toiletries. Curtains in my room were crumpled looking. Not much in the way of facilities in the hotel: you can use a fitness place a block away, and there is a restaurant affiliated with the hotel on the street corner. Noisy A/C fan in my room. Also found the lighting in the rooms, hallways, and lobby a bit stark and weird ... not very inviting IMO and more office-like than \"boutique\". Looks like they were trying to be stylish using cheap furnishings. Summary: a reasonable choice if you're looking for a convenient location to sleep, for a reasonable price. Not a place you'll want to do much besides sleep at night. I would stay here again mainly b/c the better hotels in Sydney are extremely expensive.", "Date": "November 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dundee, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cLove Sydney - Love the Diamant\u201d", "Author": "Girls0nT0ur", "ReviewID": "UR10914406", "Content": "We have just enjoyed a fantastic 7 night stay in this new hotel in Sydney - its chic, its cool and easily the best city hotel experience I can remember.
