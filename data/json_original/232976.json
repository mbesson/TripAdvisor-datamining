We stayed in room 9 (1st floor). The staff was great - friendly, helpful, and very attentive. While the hotel is not located in the middle of the city, it was a short walk to the main sites and the train station. A short walk is not a big deal at all - when you visit Italian cities, you walk and you walk a lot. In 10 - 15 minutes you'll be at Ponte Veccio and the Uffizi. The room was medium sized although the tv was extremely small. That said, who really cares about the tv . . . you are in Florence! (the only english channel was CNN). The bathroom was enormous - tub, shower and a ton of floor space.Breakfast was alright, but our experience at 2 other hotels in Rome and Venice is that breakfasts in Italy are generally nothing great - nothing like American breakfasts. This place had some different cereals, scrambled eggs, bread, fruit, and juice.The main issue was that the hotel room did not have heat. The heater/AC unit did not work. After the 1st night, I told the staff and was told it would be look at it. We came back later in the afternoon and it still was broken. I asked for another room - Florence was cold at night in mid Nov - and was told there were nothing available. The following morning we again mentioned the issue and were told that it would be fixed that day. We came back in the afternoon and were told it was fixed. We checked and, of course, it did not work. We asked to move to another room and were brought to room 3. I first checked the heat before we moved and it did not work either. We stayed in our room since we only had one additional night.Another issue was that the phone in the room did not work. After the first night, we were told that the problem was somewhere in the walls and was complex to fix. The staff offered us the use of the phone behind the desk or in their office, even offering to have the people leave the office and close the door. The phone in other room we were brought (but did not move to) worked.If it wasn't for the heat issue, the rating would be above average - but it was cold.", "Date": "Dec 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR210116008", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "NJTraveler07960"}, {"Content": "A dissonant view I will be one of the few to recommend this hotel and I really can't understand all the bad reviews.I got a room on the first floor, facing Via Curtatone, with a small balcony.

There were four of us traveling so we booked 2 rooms. Both were supposed to have 2 twin beds but when we arrived we were told that they had us down for one room with 2 twin beds and one room with a king size bed. As a result, my mother and I were forced to share the room with the king size bed. Another problem was that the internet was not working and was never fixed throughout our 3 night stay. Also, there were no english speaking TV channels, not even CNN. All of the other hotels in other countries I have stayed at have at least had CNN. The positives were that the location of the hotel was good, the room was nice and the bathroom was large and modern. The breakfast was good - hard rolls, meats and cheeses, yogurt, cereal, baked goods, juices, etc. The staff was fine - I wouldn't say they were overly friendly or helpful, but they certainly were not rude or unaccomodating. One of the people at the desk did give us a good recommendation for a restaurant on our first night there. Florence itself was wonderful! Here's a tip - if you plan on going to the Academia to see the David, which is phemonenal, book your tickets ahead of time. We didn't and waited in line for 2 1/2 hours.

The desk clerk tried to give us rooms on an upper floor of the Argentina although I'd booked the Curtatone. I flatly refused to follow him and made him give us the rooms we had booked.Unfortunately, the Curtatone side of the hotel has not been updated since we were there several years ago and the lovely carpets, drapes and furniture are filthy. The walls haven't been painted and the bathrooms could use a good cleaning instead of a damp mopping.The breakfast is just shy of better than starving and it is delivered by the surliest waitress in Florence. She'll give you a coffee grudgingly at least. The room was 80 Euros for a double booked through Venere.If you can find anything closer to the center of town with a good review...book it!
