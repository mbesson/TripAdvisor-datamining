The rooms were a good size and had all the usual amenities that one can expect from a 5 star establishment. The bathroom with the combined shower in the bathtub was a tad small , but could live with that size for a few days. The guest toiletries more than made up for the lack in bathroom size- all were expensive Elemis products , from the shampoo to the shower gel and bar soap and body lotion- all smelled and felt heavenly. The food was something else. We emjoyed 2 dinners on their rooftop signature restaurant and had a fantastic view over the city that looks magical at night. Breakfast was standard Continental fare with a distinguished touch of excellent taste and using products of the higest quality.

I was given a room next to the noisy street, with no other rooms available away from the street. I have been a platinum member for nearly 13 years and this is truly the most disappointing stay I have ever encountered with all of IHG brands. The hotel listed a pressing service that would be available starting at 7 am. When I contacted the hotel to use this service I was told that first, that this service was not available, then when I pressed the issue stating it was listed in the hotels directory of services for the hotel property the desk staff said that the person who does it was late. The desk staff said they would call when the individual showed. Nearly an hour later I received a call, but by that time it was too late, and I was late for my meeting and pressed the clothing myself. This is not what I expect from the flagship brand of this hotel chain. The only offering for any inconvenience caused was more water and more fruit. Sorry, but this service was BEYOND unacceptable. I hadn't had time to drink the water, I am a very busy executive with a government body. As for the fruit, I had not eaten any of the fruit that I received upon checkin, I had moved the orange in that basket and marked it. Upon my return to my room I found that same orange replaced in the basket and a strawberry that looked rotting placed in the fruit basket, no change of the fruit or anything. I asked to speak with the manager, he never showed or called or left a message. The individual never showed up while I checked out to discuss these issues with me. Nothing. I travel quite a bit for my work. I will NOT be using this hotel again in Rome. I make all the decisions for my people that travel to Rome, I will be using either a competitor or another IHG Brand.

This hotel has loads to offer those looking for something special!! I'm Irish and my husband is Italian from Rome. I was looking for something different particularly for those travelling from Ireland and wanted a venue based in the city centre. We checked out a couple of places and finally decided on the Intercontinental. My husband loved the place from our first visit and I have to be honest I thought the hotel looked somewhat tired (similar to a number of the reviews), but the hotel grew on me and that's the charm to this old hotel. The hotel staff couldn't have been more friendly and Domenico ( Food & Beverage Manager) couldn't have done more for us to make our day perfect. So you might ask what makes this venue so special... So for me it was the variety of atmospheres we were able to offer along with the good food & wine. We had a fairly large wedding party (95) and got married at the end of sept. weather was amazing so worked perfectly for our venue... We started our wedding reception on the roof top terrace of the hotel which offers stunning views of the city and we enjoyed the sun setting with our family & friends ... Some apetitizers & prosecco.. We then moved to the internal gardens on the second floor of the hotel for an amazing antipasti buffet - my friends are still talking about this part of the wedding reception as they loved the food and atmosphere... Following this we moved into one of the main rooms just off the internal garden for the primi & secondi.. Again the food & wine was excellent... Finally, we ventured back out to the garden to an assortment of dolci and the wedding cake... ( you might think that it was a lot of moving but if you know Italian weddings this was over about 5 hours....) again the deserts were amazing. Finally, as the Irish must do we started the party & had the dj and dancing in one of the adjacent smaller rooms off the garden and danced till approx 1.30... This was really good as I thought the hotel were going to stop music at 12... The location of the hotel is second to none and the venue offering is spectacular.. That with good food & wine makes it a top class venue for any major event along with the assistance of Domenico and all the staff who served our food & drinks on the night...

Of course such an ancient historic location in a world-class city is also pricey. BUT, the atmosphere is romantically and inspirationally ancient, both inside the hotel and outside, as you ponder the age of the real estate, the view of church domes adjacent as well as in the distance including the Vatican, feel the ancient pitted stone railings of the massive Spanish Steps, consider the repairs etched into the stones over the centuries and run your fingers through the water of the same fountain that has been there since the Middle Ages. Looking up at thousand-year-old balconies adorned with greenery and flowers in the middle of the city streets, one almost expected to see a Romeo and Juliet scene emerge in front of your eyes. Our small-but-adequate hotel room had a window on the interior marble courtyard which added to our romantic illusion of ancient nostalgia. We could walk to almost everything we wanted to do, except tourist attractions in other areas of Rome. Yes, the hotel service-charged us to death as they added an automatic percentage to everything, and uniformed staff attempted to serve us at every turn. However, the food in the hotel was very good, whether a full meal or just a cappuccino, and the service was excellent. We arrived from America on a Sunday, when most businesses including restaurants are closed, so we were grateful for the hotel's ability to provide a dining option. The wine list was also quite nice. Our room did not include breakfast in the price, but we saw the hotel's breakfast buffet menu in the tiny breakfast room, and realized that breakfast was very overpriced. However, we headed for the Vatican on Monday morning, and had a delicious breakfast in a cafe there at a very reasonable price. One morning, we purchased a cappuccino in the hotel's breakfast room, and the waitress brought pastries to go with it at no additional charge.

From the balcony we could look down onto an attractive courtyard garden, lit with Christmas lights. The room was attractively furnished, with a high ceiling, a large and comfortable bed, a good size flat screen television, and formal furnishings. We had a large smart bathroom with plenty of Elemis toiletries. There were only two minor negatives during the stay. The first is that in our room, we could hear clearly the voices of the guests in the next room and could hear their television, so the sound-insulation was not very effective. The second, even more minor suggestion, is that the hotel could insert those small magnets at the bottom of the shower curtain to hold the curtain against the metal side of the bath. While taking a shower the curtain wrapped itself around me, so I switched to taking baths instead. Overall, we really enjoyed our weekend stay at the hotel.

One must pay for internet access if not possessing a laptop. However, staff was very helpful so we could buy Vatican Museum tickets on-line an avoid the long, long lines.

We stayed 4 nights at a rate of $325 per night and shared with the hotel by email in advance that we were celebrating our honeymoon. As far as I could tell, our room was about as basic & blah as the hotel could offer. Tiny. No view. Uncomfortable. Smelly. Service is pretty standard. Not very personalized or elegant, but OK. The location is central and I imagine if it was a 3 star hotel at a substantially lower rate I would not have been as disappointed. However, having just spent 3 nights at the FABULOUS St Regis in Florence this was a major, major let down. Don't go thinking luxury in anyway.

First night booked via reward points (40,000). Second night was booked via last minute dot com @ \u00a3160 for the room only (Intercontinental wanted 350 Euros). Great location at the top of the Spanish steps and also only 15 minute walk from Trevi fountain. I emailed hotel twice ahead of our stay to say we had two reservations for the two consecutive nights but via different booking methods, giving full details of both bookings. I asked if we could stay in the same room for both nights. On arrival, they seemed unaware of the second nights reservation but quickly confirmed I could stay in the same room ok. On the seconf day, on returning to our room mid afternoon, the room key would not work - clearly we were only booked into that room originally for one night - I went to reception and they sorted it quickly though. The room was ready for us despite arriving at 11.15am - nice touch. Room was a decent size (classic double) without being large - certainly not small though - with nice period furniture. Bathrrom was lovely with robes, slippers and luxury toiletries etc. TV was modern and had internet / movies but extremley pricey. Concierge staff where very helpful and knowledgeable and where happy to adivse on routes / sightseeing / timings etc. Roof top bar was nice with live music (Saxophone player) - Diet coke and a glass of wine approx 19 Euros. (Wine was 13, coke was 6) We purchased internet for 24 hours at approx 4pm on first day but it did not work at 9.15am the next day, our departure day. Told reception who immeadiately removed the whole cost from the bill - great customer service. Lounge area on ground floor is warm and welcoming. Lounge / bar on first floor (with piano) was closed during our stay - not sure of the reason?? All in all, a lovely hotel but a little pricey. We ate out for breakfast, lunch and dinner as the hotels meals were way too pricey for us. We got train from airport to Termini station and then taxi to hotel. 23 Euros. I handed him a 20 Euro note and then looked into my wallet to get another 5 (I was going to give him the 25 with a 2 Euro tip). When I handed him the 5 Euro note, he was holding a 5 Euro note himeself and then argued that I had only given him 10 Euros. I know for sure I didn't. I ended up giving him another 13 Euros - so I had been ripped off to the tune of 15 Euros. On return to train station we got Hotel bell boy to order a taxi and asked him how much we could expect to pay - 10 to 11 Euro's he said. Good enough, at Termini station, the driver asked us for 11 Euros - so beware of theiving Taxi drivers!!", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "Roux58", "ReviewID": "UR118265543", "Content": "The hotel is in a perfect location, right near the Spanish steps, The service at the hotel is quite good, particularly Nicolas, the concierge.

Hubby and I booked a holiday in Rome and got a great deal at a great price on a UK travel website, which gave us accommodation at the Intercontinental de la Ville on a room only basis. For the price we paid, it was fantastic. Before we arrived, I contacted the hotel and asked for a firm bed if possible and a room away from the road, which I understood could be noisy. The hotel replied with a polite, helpful response. On arrival, we were given a quiet room with a decent bed. The room itself was small. However, we decided that the dimensions of the room weren't a problem, so much as the lack of furniture in which to store our clothes. Anyhow, this was our only niggle. The bed was fine, the air con worked effectively, the bathroom was clean and functioning, and we had a teeny tiny balcony, too. The hotel has a bar on the roof, which means it is a really lovely spot to enjoy views over Rome. It was a shame for us that the menu was very expensive in all respects: no good value house wine, no happy hour, nor promoted drinks. It offered 'international' food which didn't make us inclined to eat there. A beer was 10 Euros and a glass of wine was 12 Euros upwards, as I recall, with none of them fantastic wines. Our room rate didn't include breakfast and I had imagined us popping to a nearby cafe for a coffee and reasonably priced pastry or similar for breakfast. We did frequent a cafe just down the road from the hotel, which made an excellent coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice, but it was a wallet-draining experience for little joy (on the food front). The hotel interior on the ground floor is rather nice with a pleasant lobby and bar area. We found the staff very pleasant and helpful and particularly (and for us probably the highlight of the hotel) the concierge desk. We asked for information, directions, help with booking a taxi (our choice of taxi) back to the airport, and we asked for restaurant recommendations on several occasions. On every occasion the concierge staff were polite and happy to help and the recommendations for restaurants were excellent.

Here goes:- My family are a family of FIVE (two adults and three small children). We ALWAYS reserve either a two-bedroom suite with an extra bed for child number 3, or two interconnecting rooms with an extra bed. We have been doing exactly this for the past seven years with no exceptions. We had booked to visit Athens to show our children the sights a while back but had to cancel after the riots started. To make up for it, some months later, with no sign of Greece settling down, we decided to substitute a trip to Rome. As we intended to be out site-seeing every day, we didn\u2019t book our usual two-bed suite but went for two interconnecting rooms, with an extra single bed. We made the big mistake of booking through Intercontinental Central Reservations. Although the emailed confirmation I received on booking did not include much detail, the Intercontinental agent assured me that we had the exact accommodation noted on file that we required INCLUDING the extra 5th bed. Days before our Rome holiday, my wife was told by her doctor that she was not allowed to fly, my little boy was not too well and so we decided that I would cancel one of the rooms and retain the room with the extra bed and I would still take my two daughters, meaning there would be three of us. Intercontinental Hotels told me that we had not reserved a room with a 3rd bed (rubbish and totally untrue) and that the rooms were too small for a third bed. If true then they must be VERY small indeed. After a futile discussion, I told them to find me a room or suite with room for an extra bed. They told me they were full and could not accommodate me. I then contacted many other hotels, including Leading Hotels group and they were also all fully booked. Rome was full. I had to cancel my booking as I was not prepared to leave one of my daughters behind. Originally, after securing hotel accommodation for the FIVE of us, I had booked and paid for FIVE return flights from London to Rome on British Airways. I lost the cost of all five flights thanks to the central booking service for this hotel. I did not check the hotel out on Tripadviser before booking and I wish I had. I expected the hotel to be good as I\u2019ve been a regular at the Carlton in Cannes for some years (also an Intercontinental). Now that I\u2019ve read about it, it\u2019s possibly a blessing in disguise that they messed up our booking and I lost our BA flights as a result. Complaining to Intercontinental Customer Services was a waste of time. They offered me some hotel points! That is not good enough, I don\u2019t want points, I want the service I should be reasonably able to expect from an Intercontinental Hotel. I used to use Intercontinental Hotels when they were good, in the 1970\u2019s. Now they seem to be owned by Holiday Inn. Certainly their Customer Relations service was rubbish and their escalated \u201cHi-Guest Relations\u201d department had the cheek to insist that I did not book a room with an extra bed but only accommodation for four people. They are so wrong. I never forget about my third child, I booked five BA flights and this arrogance displayed by their Guest Relations is just appalling. They seem to think that they can do no wrong. We will return to Rome, we will check out hotels on Tripadviser first and will no doubt stay at one of the Leading Hotel group hotels and avoid Intercontinental. My tip for this hotel, don\u2019t trust central reservations at Intercontinental.

If you want to take a shower you have to step into the small bath. The shower curtain comes to you the entire time. The shower itself is not a high quality shower. We also saw molt in the shower. We asked for Internet (WIFI). This is EUR 12 for one hour or EUR 23 for one day. This price is too expensive, however we took the Internet for one day. We did NOT have any internet in the room. Only one point (next to the door) had some Internet access. If you dare to ask EUR 23 for one day for WIFI be sure it works throughout the entire hotel and not only in the public areas. I contacted the reception and they said maintenance would fix it the next day. It was not fixed. So staying in Room 324, do not use Internet! We did not have a turndown service. This is something you expect in an Intercontinental and in a 5-star hotel, but here nobody comes to clean the room in the evening. When we asked for suggestions for restaurants, one of the concierge was rude. He immediately informed us where to eat, without asking what kind of food. We said we wanted to go to a quiet restaurant he said: \" on a Saturday night, come on\". This is not the service you expect in a 5-star hotel. The other concierge took it over and suggested a great restaurant. The roof bar is a perfect location for a drink. Not cheap, but worth it. Checking out was efficient however there was no bellboy. I asked the receptionist if he could contact a taxi. He said he would do it, but he never did. We had to walk out of the hotel with our luggage to the taxi place next to the Spanish stairs because the staff does not look after its customers. I do not like this hotel at all. The best was the location, the worst the service and Internet.

What a perfect time to enjoy Rome - sunny, high 70's during the day, and cool breezes at night. We walked everywhere, never took a cab, and a few times, caught the Metro to as many of the sites as we could fit in. Walking is truly the best method of seeing the city - hands down. Upon check in, we were greeted with a round of \"Buon Giornos!\", told we were given an upgrade from a balcony room to a terrace room, and when we asked for glasses and ice, received prompt service. I can't complain about the service at all. The front desk was always friendly and helpful. Despite the age of the hotel, the room was clean and the bathroom was always well stocked with supplies/towels. The terrace was key after a long day of walking all over the city, allowing us to unwind with a glass of excellent wine while we downloaded our pictures to our laptop and review our day. In the evenings, we discussed where to have dinner among the MANY wonderful and little restaurants around the city. There were lots of great little places in the side streets just off the Piazza di Spagna, where the Spanish Steps are located, just below the hotel. Wander around a little bit and you'll be sure to find a place that will make you happy. The Spanish Steps are lively in the evenings - EVERY evening - but one comment about that location: the hotel is at the top of the steps. After a long day of walking all over historic Rome, the last thing you want to do is climb those infernal steps. If you can't do steps very well, this hotel may not be the best place for you. You can also get to the hotel by walking up the street from the other side but that's uphill as well. We decided that next time we visit Rome, we'll choose a spot near Piazza Navona and the Pantheon. That's a great area - and it's level! In sum, the hotel was very nice. It was clean, had friendly service, and the 6th floor terrace bar had beautiful views. The drinks were expensive as was the room but we chalk that up to the norm inasmuch as the Intercontinental competes with the reknown Hassler, which is right next door. The location is perfect for a bird's eye view but not so perfect after a long day. Our experience at the hotel was interwoven with our over all experience in the Eternal City.

I booked through a travel agent and paid in advance. I called Intercontinental in March to confirm that the reservation/payment was made and it was pre-paid and they confirmed it was and gave me my booking numbers. 2 weeks prior to our trip I contacted all the hotels that we were staying at in Rome, Venice and Florence and again confirmed our reservations, payments, etc. I also printed copies of all confirms and bought them with me. When we checked out of the de la ville, the last hotel of our stay, I asked for a copy of our reciept reflecting the zero balance but was told the copier was broken, the printer wasn't working and they couldn't email me a reciept. This of course was of great concern but I was assured there were no charges and as it was 6am and our ride to the airport had already been waiting 20 minutes I couldn't pursue the matter. Unfortunately my October credit card statement reflected the full 3 rooms/2 night stay from the de la ville. I contacted customer service at Intercontinental and was told it was a billing error on the part of de la ville, but it was a separate, independant hotel from Intercontinental and therefore they didn't have access to the hotel's billing so the hotel would have to provide the credit. I received an incident number and was told I would have a resolution within 30 days. The charge was dropped and then put back on my January statement. I immediately called customer service again at Intercontinental and was told again, that the rooms were prepaid and the charges should have credited and they said the hotel never contacted them either even after several attempts by Intercontinental. They called the de la ville while I was on hold and told me that the hotel would look into it. I finally just heard back from the hotel after 3 more emails to them with no response. They said the charges stay as they weren't paid by the travel agency (from a year ago). I requested a copy of my reciept with my signature authorizing this and asked why suddenly after a year of being told everhting was paid for and all set they are now stating differently. I'm still waiting a response. So bottomline, if you want to have your wonderful Italian vacation ruined by being double charged and spending endless hours fighting this upon your return, then this is the hotel for you. To add insult to injury, our rooms were in a wing that was under construction so we had carts both and forth overhead and banging all hours of day and night and our \"view\" was a dirty exhaust fan and dirty window into the garage.

The staff was friendly and helpful and the concierge service even provided high quality umbrellas for the days it was raining. I've stayed in a number of hotels in Rome over the the years and I must say that this one has by far the best location to be at if you are a tourist. If I had to wrack my brain for a negative, the only thing I can think of was the restaurant which was recommended for Christmas Eve dinner. It was the only restaurant I went to in Rome where the tables were too close together, almost all the patrons were English speaking tourists, it was overpriced, plus they charged a cover charge and a service charge.

All of which are available for a fraction of the cost if you can be bothered to walk a few minutes from the hotel. The only gripe is that this is a chain hotel, so why cant Intercontinental have the amenities in rooms the same at each location for example, there is no in room coffee maker or IPod dock - as there has been in every other Ic I have stayed in. None of which however is enough to deduct a star. All in all an excellent (if expensive) hotel in an excellent central location, we had an excellent long weekend, made partly by the very helpful staff. An excellent tip - pre-book the Sistine Chapel online and avoid a 4 hour line to get in.", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location, great service - worth the extra expense\u201d", "Author": "Piripi_NZ", "ReviewID": "UR80043612", "Content": "The memory of an amazing stay in an idyllic location will last a long time.

The general manager of the hotel named Giacomo, however, took notice of our situation, and immediately stepped in. He provided us with a room that was technically out of service due to some wiring issues, but was otherwise perfectly fine and very clean. My husband and I were given a place to rest until our official room was available. I am eternally grateful for Giacomo for being kind, understanding, and very hospitable. Although my husband tried to give Giacomo an extra tip for his services, he profusely declined and said that it was his pleasure to help us out. I understand that Giacomo was doing his job, but we really felt that his kindness went above and beyond what we experienced before while travelling in Europe (and in the USA for that matter). Once our official room was ready, we found out that Giacomo ugraded us to a room with a very nice balcony with a full table for sitting outside. It was heavenly!

The concierge staff was knowledgeable, very helpful and friendly - printing out maps, arranging transport, etc. Our experience was a mixed bag, however, which started out rough, but ended up well. My husband and I were travelling to Rome for 3 short days to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary, and I wanted a very special place with great views from our room. We have in the past travelled quite a bit and have had some wonderful hotel rooms with incredible views, so for such a special occasion this was a priority. I had booked, after much research and reviews, what I thought was a city view room with a terrace or balcony on either the 6th or 7th floor (their lower floor rooms have only a limited busy street view or inner courtyard view) with one King bed. We had let them know that it was a very special occasion and requested the nicest view room in our category. Upon arrival I was shocked to find that our room was not only NOT a city view room, but on the bottom, first floor. The \"view\" of the courtyard was a view of the ugly a/c unit and the deck was a shared patio with no privacy at all. There were also two separate double beds and after calling down to reception we were told that someone would come up and move our beds together. What??? So, we went to dinner and hours later when we came back, the beds were right where they were and so we squeezed into the one double bed. We were so exhausted at that point after travelling almost 20 hours to get there and full day and night of walking around, we were dead tired. We did not purchase the lowest tier category of room and also were promised a room upgrade with our paid Ambassador club status. The clerk upon check in was of no help and told us there were no city view rooms available. After seeing our room and being extremely disappointed, we asked to speak with a manager. Pamela was able to find us a room on the 6th floor with a city view for the next two nights. So we had to stay in that room for the night and switch over the next day. So the next day after 4:00 p.m., we packed up and they moved us. From here it all gets better... not only did they move us, but we now had a top floor room on the 7th floor with a sweeping view of the city with St. Peter's in the distance and a very private huge terrace with 3 french doors that led outside. So one night in a lower class, non-view dark, dismal room and 2 nights in the other beautiful room with one King bed and views is what we got. The inner courtyard outdoor eating area was absolutely lovely - although it rained during our entire trip so it was unusable. But, the indoor restaurant was equally appealling and the breakfast, which was included in the price of our room with our Ambassador Club status what elaborate and delicious. We did not eat there for any other meals however - there are just way too many other wonderful places to try. The bar on the second floor was cozy and we loved the bar staff there. Very friendly and professional. They also have a rooftop open area bar, but it was pretty much closed because of the rain. I'm sure in nice weather it would be a great place to have a cafe or cocktail with a view of the city. Our bed was very comfy with crisp, clean white sheets. Our bathroom was large, clean, but could definitley use a higher quality toilet paper. Seriously, it was rough and one ply. For $500 a night, you expect a little more. All in all I think the de la Ville is a very nice hotel (right next door to the uber-expensive Hassler) but they need to work on their handling of room assignments and reservations desk. Everything else was wonderful and we didn't let it spoil our trip. However, had they not been able to accomodate us and give us the room we thought we had booked, we would have pulled out and gone somewhere else. If you want a room with a city view be extra careful and book it directly with the hotel and get a confirmation IN WRITING of the type of room you will get. If you want an inner-courtyard room, just make sure it's not on the first or second floor.", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cFabulous in every way...\u201d", "Author": "Lucy77", "ReviewID": "UR64906550", "Content": "We recently held an international business meeting at the InterContinental.

Pino, the concierge, recommended the most amazing restaurants (including 2 for group dinners) and was always willing to help find a shop nearby to do some quick shopping (olive oil, wine, children's clothes, etc.). The rooms were clean, well-appointed (flat-screen TVs), and full sized tub/showers. Mine was on the small side, but when in Rome, you aren't in your room much, so it was perfect for just me. I travel a lot for business and plan many international meetings a year for our customers- the InterContinental Rome is by far one of my favorite hotels for service, accommodation of our needs, and ambience for our meeting and customers. I have stayed in several Rome hotels for business and pleasure and the InterContinental has been the best. It should be noted that is was my 5th trip to Rome.

Let me tell you a story. On the third day of our Rome visit, my wife fell on the cobblestone street two blocks from the hotel. She suffered significant facial lacerations and a broken left arm. Someone in the crowd informed the hotel and by the time we were starting toward the hotel, we were ment by the manager, Giacoma Pica and concierge Filippo. They provided first aid at the hotel and Giacoma took us by cab to the hospital, waited three hours with us providing translation and consolation while the doctors performed diagnostics, sutured the lesions, and cast the arm. Giaacoma then brought us back to the hotel, took me to the pharmacy for medications again providing translation and support. He put us in contact with the hotel physician (who was very supportive) as well as providing numerous additional services to assist us (such as sending staff to pick up our train tickets, coordinating our transportaion to Positano and alerting the hotel in Positano of our situation). It was like having your own father help you. All of this was provided at no charge. What was done for us was way beyond the call of duty and I cannot say enought about Giacoma Pica, a wonderful human being who we will cherish the rest of our lives. The hotel is beautiful, the location superb, the food is excellent and the service impeccable. Being a grand European hotel, it is beautifully appointed and retains unique antique qualities in the rooms and public areas. Outdoor patios off the dinning areas and a bar area on the top of the hotel (with magnificent views of Rome) offer wonderful dinning experiences should you need a break from all that the city has to offer. However, the most important point about the De La Ville Intercontinental Roma is the fact that is is staffed by some of the most wonderful people you will ever encounter. I can only hope you have the opportunity to stay and this great hotel, and should you encounter an emergency or acute condition, you can only hope that you are a guest here.

Opening windows also brings in lots of the car pollution and cigarette smoke. If I could do it over again, I'd ask for a room facing the courtyard rather than the street side. Second, in spite of the fact we showed up with an infant and stroller, we were given a room that required several steps down and several steps up to get to the room. Had to carry the stroller up and down these steps the four nights we stayed there. There are rooms that have easier access without the steps on the left wing of the building. Ask for a room on the left wing if you have a wheelchair or a stroller. Third, the rooms do not have air conditioning.

We paid about $300 including taxes, etc., per night, per room; we booked 2 rooms for 3 nights (4/1 - 4/4). A couple of weeks before our trip, we called and spoke to Giacomo Pica, the Hotel Manager. From that phone call, until we checked out, we only had positive experiences and we had the most luxurious stay. Mr. Pica greeted us early (1PM) when we got there and our rooms were set up and waiting for us specifically. He set us up in 2 adjoining rooms, each had a king - we flowed in and out of the 2 rooms. The staff also set up full sized cots in each room. The rooms, beds, bathrooms, etc., were perfect - down comforters, tons of pillows, clean rooms, etc. The bathrooms had everything you needed - extra kits with toothbrushes, slippers for each of us, etc. Moments after we unpacked and settled, we were also greeted with champagne. The location was perfect. We looked out onto the top of the Spanish Steps. We easily walked to the Pantheon, the Trevi Fountain, Borghese Museum, subways, etc. We never cabbed at all, just took the subway a little and did a lot of walking. My husband and I had my parents with us (both in mid and late 70's) and our children. My Dad just had a knee replacement in January (78 years old) and did all the same walking that we did and climbed the Spanish steps up and down several times =). We also had teenage girls with us and were comfortable with them moving around the lobby, etc. We even walked back to the hotel from the Vatican one night. Walking in Rome is beautiful. Keep in mind, you can walk to this hotel from several different directions, avoiding the steps easily if you desire. Our cab dropped us right at the front door the first day. We opted not to buy coffee, eat in or use the internet here but waited for our next destination and used our blackberries, etc., instead. The concierge was very helpful in pointing us toward museums, restaurants, the best routes to take - there was always more than enough help at that desk with maps, etc. They booked our Borghese Museum trip too (you need a reservation). The grounds are beautiful there by the way; if you are a runner, it feels a bit like Central Park, NY. The common areas at the hotel were beautiful. We sat at night and read, had wine, etc. Overall, we found Rome a bit expensive...do as much research as you can and I would not recommend the cafe just several doors down from this hotel (away from the Spanish Steps), but rather the one on the way to the Borghese (around the corner). We also rented a car (just a several block walk from the hotel) on the way out of Rome at the Europcar office - very convenient. Contact Giacomo Pica if you plan to visit and have specific specifications/expectations. The charm and location were spectacular and Mr. Pica was more than accommodating the entire time we were there. We look forward to visiting Rome again and would love to stay at the de la Ville again.

Location above the Spanish Steps was perfect for us though some friends prefer other areas. We found the property because our parents used to stay at the Hassler which is more expensive and a little better rated but the de la Ville is right next door and seems almost as boutique-y though, yes, not quite as refined but then again I saved $200+ a night which made our wines less expensive at dinner! If you can afford that Hassler do it but the de la Ville has been splendid for us. I must say that when we arrived at our 7th floor room for the first time I almost didn't go in and instead went back downstairs to request another room but that would have been our mistake, our door was right next to the elevators but surprisingly it was a suite with a long but thin terrace. I was still a little concerned about hearing the elevators but we didn't at all. From our terrace the views over Roma were breathtaking, morning, day and nigh, simply stunning and if you aren't in this area of the city it is difficult to have the elevation in order to see all of Rome. It seems that if you are on the 5th floor or below, floors we nevr stayed on, you have more obstructed views by the buildings across the street though if you have an interior facing room/view, what you might call the \"lanai view\" if you were on the ocean you overlook a lovely green space and the hotel's attractive and open aire restaurant so that might be pleasant and I know it was much less of a tariff to stay therer. We had breakfast in that restaurant twice, the rest of the mornings we had room service delivered to our terrace so we could sip the hotel's fabulous coffee while dining on fresh fruit and bakery items (as folks know, eggs, omeletes and bacon are hardly Italian specialties). I can't speak more highly about the feeling coupled with the visualy appealing al fresco experience one has from that terrace when enjoying the NYT's online (delivered each morning) and sipping coffee with your favorite person by your side. Sunsets kept us returning every evening with wine, cheese and salami in hand for terrace decompressions before preparing dinner, and we rarely saw other guests on the adjoining balconies. Oh, breakfast in the sunlight filled restaurant we terrific... and was included in our rate. Beautifully marbled and tiled baths make even an American Four Season's look pitiful!!

I have stayed with the Intercontinental brand before back home in the U.S. and have always had a high quality experience. For the location, I am not sure you can beat it. The hotel is directly atop the Spanish Steps and every major attraction is easily walkable. We did read the reviews about having to climb the steps to go home every night, but unless you have difficulty walking, how many chances do you get to climb the spanish steps to go to bed? Also it is a very short walk to the Borgeshe gardens which made a great place to have some down time with the children. Our room was in-line with sizes for Europe and that was with a jr. suite. Certainly not a suite by U.S. standards, but a tremendous room for Europe. Yes, the decor is not necessarily modern, the room was very clean and the bedding very comfortable. For those traveling with younger children, unfortunatley there really are no choices for television or movies in the room for them. The service here is outstanding, especially concierge with Nicola and his staff. Nicola was able to pick up tickets to Palm Sunday mass at the Vatican days before our arrival at the hotel. Having that experience was truly once in a lifetime, and I am very grateful to have gotten those tickets. The desk greeted our children each and every time we walked by and made them feel right at home. The service at the restaraunt for breakfast and lunch was also world class. My only disapointment was the cost of food at the hotel. Certainly the value for location and the room were worth it, but breakfast and dinner costs were astonishing. Normally, we would avoid frequent dining at the hotel, but it was the most conveinent option with some early morning excursions. The breakfast buffet has tremendous choice but carries a price of 35Euro ($47 US) per person. We did try the restaraunt for dinner, again the service was phenomenal, but the quality of the food certainly not worth the outrageous price.

Deluxe room was large and had a good-sized bathroom with a great shower. The heat was still on (60F outside), so we had to leave the window open our first night, which was very loud with vespas and trucks going by. We notified the front desk and they were able to turn the heat off to our room the following morning. The public internet in the lobby didn't work during our 3-day stay (10 Euros for 30 minutes).

I paid approximately $1500.00 for a seven-night stay. The hotel accepted my bid; It should not have relegated me to some kind of steerage-class treatment. There was no, \u201cWelcome to the Intercontinental\u201d, no other greeting. The only difference between my reception and that at a Motel 6 was there was no bulletproof glass between the staff and me. The room was clean, not particularly well appointed, a little threadbare, on the small side and facing a very noisy street. I seldom saw anyone in the hotel, either in the small lobby area or in the cocktail lounge. They might have assigned me a room with a better view, larger, whatever. This room had a listed maximum rate of 973 Euros, My son and I ordered room service our first night in the hotel. The server was only perfunctory in his service, hardly gracious or polite. In entering our room and in negotiating the tiny space between the bed and the desk, he actually kicked my shoes out of his way. The food, perhaps typical of Roman cuisine, was mediocre at best. I usually enjoy hotel food, finding it consistently better than average in the various hotel chains where I stay. I spend at least fifty nights a year in hotels. The poached salmon with spinach was the best part of our meal even though the spinach was way over salted. The salad was good too. Surprisingly, the Italian dishes were terrible. The pizza tasted as if they had used frozen dough, undercooked, with a lackluster tomato sauce but with good cheese in the proper proportions. I eat better pizza in nearly any chain restaurant in the states. It was not indicative of pizza in Rome having eaten some great pizza there. The Spaghetti was even worse, a ball of overcooked pasta with too much sauce and parmesan cheese that looked and tasted like the stuff you buy in supermarkets in the USA. Canned spaghetti came to mind. They should have changed the name of the reception desk to the rejection desk. When I checked in, the staff told me I needed to show them my son\u2019s passport so that he could get his own key to our room. Later that day, we walked up to the desk and there was one woman behind the reception desk who was on the phone. I would have expected her to acknowledge our presence with some kind of facial expression, or even to look at us. She didn\u2019t. She continued on the phone, purposely avoiding any type of acknowledgement to us. After almost five minutes on the phone, somewhat annoyed sounding and not hiding that emotion, she provided us with an additional key. I had another experience at the front desk, from a different person, who was completely aloof to me and acted like I was annoying him. Even the doorman and the concierge avoided us. I am used to greeting people, including the staff in hotels, and am used to them greeting me. There were never any salutations from the staff in the front of the hotel. In fact, they always looked like they were avoiding us. Besides my brief interaction with a housekeeper, the bartender, in the always-empty cocktail lounge, was the only pleasant person I dealt with. He came up to me as I was standing in the vacant room and took ownership of any problems I had. The Ritz-Carlton chain must have trained him.", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami,FL", "Title": "\u201cRome = ROMANCE...

The first thing you will notice....the rooms are tiny. I understand by European standards this is probably an ordinary sized room. No big deal...I can handle a small, musty old room. The real problem occurred when my Amex bill arrived and it had a $500 charge for a no-show reservation! I immediately called Priority club (I am a platinum member) for an explanation. They explained to me that I had 2 separate reservations, and that I didn't show up for 1 of them. This was a shock to me, considering I made the reservation over the phone with one of their reps, I had no idea why I would have 2 reservations. The rep told me they would contact the hotel and explain what happened and get a refund for me. Mistakes happen, and I was fine with that. Well, you can imagine how disappointed I was when they called me back and said the hotel had refused to refund my money!!! I have tried everything, and the hotel has just refused all of my attempts at a refund. I know this problem originated with the Intercontinental booking agent and not this particular hotel. However, the hotel's handling of the situation once they were explained what happened has been abysmal. Up to this debacle I stayed at Priority Club properties almost every week for work, but after finding out how they treat their Platinum members, I am now solidly a Hilton man (we stayed at several Hilton properties while in Europe and had nothing short or amazing service at every one). If you like over-priced, small rooms with no view, then this is the hotel for you! If you like getting ripped-off at every chance, please stay at this hotel!

It was my first time in Rome, so I found the location especially good as it was right next to the Spanish Steps and the Spagna subway station. Quite convenient indeed. Rome is lovely to walk around in during the month of October and I remember walking all the way back from The Vatican one day. The rooms are a bit of a squeeze but sufficient for a couple. There is also a roof-top bar which has pretty nice views of the surroundings. The concierge were very helpful as well. Being a first-timer, I had a lot of questions and the gentleman at the counter was very obliging. I would imagine that this hotel would be quite expensive (EUR300-400?) if i had to pay normal rates.

We were 2 people with a month's worth of luggage each and no place to put even a carry on bag. We could not get into our wall safe without removing a lamp from the table because it was placed in front of the safe. We could not move in our room without stepping on or over luggage. Our balcony overlooked surrounding walls and kitchen where some sort of liquid was dumped onto the ground.

The aircon was essential as the noise outside made it impossible to leave the balcony doors open. The biggest problem we experienced however wasn't from noise outside but from inside the hotel, namely the roof terrace directly above our room. At 2 in the morning we were woken by (guests or staff ?) dragging furniture around. The noise came straight down into our room. The same happened on the second night. So a word of warning: if you are offered rooms 501, 502 or 503 DECLINE THEM IMMEDIATELY unless you want to spend the early hours of the morning wide awake. The hotel management must know of this problem and yet they do nothing to restrict access to the terrace or soundproof the bedrooms below. Service in the hotel is pretty awful. On the telephone in the bedroom there's an \"Instant Service\" button to press if you need anything. We pressed the button several times during our stay, firstly to ask for an iron and secondly to enquire about refreshments in our room. The phone either rang and rang with no answer or if someone did bother to answer it they made you feel like they were doing you an enormous favour.

The bathroom was nicely lined with travertine marble, but that is not saying much for Rome where even the footpaths (where there are any) are trimmed with travertine. But the narrow over bath shower facilities with plastic draw curtain are very last century. Also, the broken toilet paper holder remained broken for the 6 nights of my stay, indicating an indifferent attitude to maintenance. Despite this being Rome, I think the hotel needs to be completely overhauled if it wants to be a true 5 star hotel. Mind you the prices are 5 star (350 euro per day plus very pricey 23 euro per day for medium speed internet), but for the same money you could be residing on the Via Veneto, an infinitely preferable address to the narrow, noisy and dirty Via Sistina.

The location, the price, the exquisite room and most importantly an amazing team of professionals who demonstrate kindness, knowledge of the area and charisma. After spending many nights in European hotels, this location offers a more luxurious room for the price and outstanding customer service. The price of the room is fabulous compared to the competition in the area. Other hotels can be double or triple the price. When you arrive, you see the magnificent view atop the Spanish steps ( the elite area of Rome). You will be greeted by a fabulous team (Ernesto, Nicola, Christian) who will recommend their favorite restaurants or plan your day. The duty manager, Giacoma Pica (my favorite), takes amazing pride in ensuring all of his guests are happy. He will work his magic ensuring you enjoy your stay. When you arrive in your room, you will be presented with classy Italian decor. Research the 11 different room types to meet your specific needs. Make sure you have breakfast on the terrace with the fountains and statues and I always finish my evening with a glass of wine listening to music on the rooftop overlooking the city of Rome. Need I say more, my favorite hotel in Europe. It always makes me sad to leave but I know I will always return to this hotel next year.

Lets starts with the location. The De La Ville is at the top of the Spanish Steps. It is in the heart of the city and staying here will make your life so much easier in Rome. Via Condotti with the world reknown shopping is a minute away, you can walk to Trevi Fountain or dine at any number of great restaurants that are yours for the choosing. And if you don not feel like going out to eat or miss the shops the hotel restaurant is delicious and the boutique downstairs has it all and does it all ... Femme Sistina the boutique has one-of-kind gifts, clothes, accessories and a signature perfume that I feel in love with immediately! (Love at first whiff) Plus Femme Sistina has a full service salon where you can wax, get a great blow dry or pedi-manicure that you didn\u00b4t have time to do before leaving on your vacation. The salon also boasts whos who clientele dating back from when Audry Hepburn to Nicole Kidman! They have stayed very current and are experts. But you will not find attitude here. The owner is so gracious and her staff lovely. The service for InterContinental de la Ville is superior to other hotels. I have stayed at many 5 and 4 star hotels, but they cannot compete with InterContinental de la Ville\u00b4s service. My family felt like royalty. The staff knows your name and waiters remember the little things you like about your meals. No request or problem goes unsolved. The staff is always happy to direct you and fulfill every need. Warm and generous. Reception and staff are also fluent in multiple languages so there is never a difficulty there. Good sevice is often hard to find across the board at one hotel ... yet from the maid service to reception and I can easily say this is the best service I have had in a hotel in the US or abroad. The rooms are very comfortable and have a first class decor and style. The bed and sheets are extremely comfortable and luxurious which after a long day of sight seeing and walking on cobblestoned Roman streets is a welcomed relief! Spacious and quiet. I love the window blinds the electronically operate on the exterior of your window being certain to block out any unwanted light in the morning. The Italian decor and furniture is rich too, but muted and practical too to make your stay relaxing. One of the highlights is the fantastically delicious brunch they have available every morning. The selection is very diverse, delicious and provides abundant health conscious options. Numerous fruits, egg prepartion options, breads, cereals, juices, and beverages (lattes prepared to order -- I had my decaf latte witrh no problem) cakes, crepes, meats, cheese, even champagne! And many healty substitues such as rice milk ... the only one I have found offered at breakfast and I have been to three European countries this summer. My list of the men simple does not do it justice. The common areas of the hotel, lobby, dining room, sitting areas, business center and rooftop longe with an incredible view of the city are all gorgeous and comfortable. A combination that had me looking forward to returning back to our hotel each night. As for the cost. Your euros stretch very far for the accomodations themselves, unbeatable location, they-thought-of-everything-amenities and excellent service.

The hotel manager on duty gave me his business card, and took the time to recommend a fabulous restaurant just down the street (not down the steps) called Ciampini's (pronounced Champeenees). Which is a quaint, open air, beautiful restaurant, that overlooks Rome. Highly recommend a wonderful meal here. The hotel lobby decor at first impression comes across very gawdy. Old deep red drapes along the windows, antique furniture throughout. Was not overly impressed at first sight. But once we got to our room, we found it comfortable, stylish, and the bathroom was beautiful with different colored marbles, very clean, and was very satisfied with it all. We had a room with a balcony overlooking the very small courtyard. It was relaxing to sit out there with the complimentary champagne that they had delivered to the room. Then you go to the 2nd level to the lovely, but very pricey bar and restaurant. On the top floor (6th), they have an open air balcony with views of all of Rome. Went up there on the Sat. evening and they had live entertainment, linens on all the small round tables, and waiters waiting to pour you a glass of wine. It was so utterly romantic, took my breath away. The service at this place is just wonderful, hands down. The only criticisms are that there is not a lot of cafes immediately around the hotel. All the action and dining is down below at the base of the Spanish steps. And after the 4th or 5th time climbing up and down those steps to get to the hotel, I am sure some people would start complaining. For us, we are relatively fit, so if it was tough for us, I know it would be tough for others, maybe the elderly especially. We did hear there was an elevator, but never found it. Top attractions for us were the Roman Forum and Colloseum. Palatine Hills is so huge and extensive, wear good walking shoes if you decide to cover it all. To save money and aggravation, be sure to go to Ricksteves.com before you leave for your trip and download for free on your MP3 his audioguide of the Colloseum and Forum. Also avoid the massive long lines to get in to the Colloseum and prebook your tix on line. Get the Rick Steves book on Rome for invaluable information on how to prebook the Colloseum, Borghese Galleria (must be prebooked ahead of time), and definitely book a tour for the Vatican, expect to do a lot of walking. Make sure to get to the Forum, it was even the highlight over the Colloseum for us. To see the ancient Roman Pagan temples still standing with their huge pillars 3 thousand years old, totally awe inspiring. Make sure you research and learn about the history before you go to these places to really appreciate what you are looking at. Another must see is the St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City. Blew me away the enormity of this place. The Sistine Chapel actually didn't meet expectation. There is so much hype, but it is very dark in there so it was actually difficult to see the ceiling, and what you see leading up to it are much more stunning. Rome in general exceeded all expectation at how very clean, safe and beautiful it is. I have been to about 8 European countries, and this one so far is the most American-friendly I've found, has the best food hands down, cleanest, safest, and the history here is so overwhelming. This is where Western civilization started. The concept of our U.S. houses of congress is mirrored after the ancient republic of Rome, the architecture of the White House in D.C. was inspired by the Roman Pantheon.

We were given a complimentary room upgrade, bottle of Spumante and Easter cake - which got the stay off to a great start! Have stayed at an Intercontinental before (Tokyo in 2003) so was pleased to see the nice little touches remained (robe, slippers, great bathroom toiletries for free of charge). Perhaps the best addition about the Rome hotel was the concierge who was able to get us tickets to the Easter service at the Vatican with only 12 hours notice. Room 619 was comfortable enough and had a balcony overlooking the central courtyard. It was cramped though for walking around (less than 1 foot of space on two sides of the bed, and 2 feet on the third side). It was also very dusty, running fingers along surfaces produced big clumps of white dust. The dust was not taken care of by the daily room cleaning and we had to complain. The air conditioning unit was embedded into the wall and had no effect at either heating or cooling the room. It only increased the dust issue, pumping out dust from the dirty vent and shaft behind the vent. The sink in the bathroom was cracked and the glue used to reseal it was peeling off. The bathroom door was chipped and dented at the bottom, not what you would expect from a supposedly top 5* hotel. After complaining we were offered a new similar room. We had requested a double bed but it was actually two singles held together by the sheets. I know this is increasingly common in hotels now but not what you want on your honeymoon or at such a top and expensive hotel. Our two biggest problems were the pricing of breakfast and amenities and the courtyard music. A simple continental breakfast, inlcuding juice, coffee a croissant, some bread and jam for one person was \u20ac24. A movie in the room was \u20ac18. Ridiculous! The courtyard was charming, plenty of plants, a fountain, elegant talbes, chairs and umbrellas for the sun, but come 12 noon they put on the music. OK, I am a bit of a music nut, but surely no one can want to listen to Stevie Wonder's \"I just called\" or the Bond theme \"Live and Let die\" played out on wind pipes 20 times in one day! It was one of those CD compilations which is covers of well known songs, it consisted of only 12 songs and was put on repeat EVERY SINGLE DAY ALL DAY. When I called the concierge on the third day he actually laughed when I told him because the music drove all the staff crazy too! They switched if off and we had silence for the rest of the stay. How a hotel brand as international and prestigious as the intercontinental can think that this is appropriate music for their central Rome hotel is beyond me. The hotel is also being refurbished so the lounge passed through to the lifts for the rooms is boarded up and you have to walk through a small make shift corridor. Ignore the photos of this lobby lounge on any website at the moment (April 2009) as this is not what you currently get! This was not such a big deal (we never use the lobbies anyway) and the hotel were very apologetic. However this is not mentioned on their or Hotwire's (we used them to book) website and the hotel were unable to give any indication of a finish date. Also be aware that the hotel across the road is being completely refurbished and is covered in scaffolding and has three cranes outside. I would avoid a room on that side of the hotel if possible and the view from the roof terrace bar is compromised. We paid over \u00a3700 for four nights here using Hotwire (a discount of almost \u00a3300 on the current rates) but even this is overpriced for what we consider no more than an average stay.

The concierge was friendly and helpful and helped us book tours. Housekeeping was very nice and friendly with our requests (ie. electric kettle). The buffet breakfast was great. The room we stayed in was on the small side but very clean. Things I wasn't happy about: Ridiculously expensive internet fees - in this day and age, internet should come free with rooms, as it was with other hotels we stayed at. In some parts of the hotel (hallways, lobby downstairs), the decor is quite old. I know it's supposed to look old fashioned, but paint was peeling in some places and carpet coming undone. As one of the reviews below mentioned, the toilet is set up really weird whereby the toilet paper holder sticks out near the toilet so that your leg gets squashed to the toilet paper holder. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the shower curtain sticks to you when you're using the shower. The shower curtains were very clean, but still it's annoying! Overall I think this hotel is good.

I think we took a taxi 3 x's over the week. Hotel is located right by the Spanish Steps and the \"Rodeo Drive\" equivalent in Rome. There are many other boutiques and shopping in the area that are also more affordable, if you are not looking for your next Gucci purse. Train station is within 10-12 mins of the hotel. We did not dine at the hotel except for the Christmas buffet (which was really outstanding....many choices, fresh food and stocked), so can't comment on the hotel restaurants food. My only suggestion is that I would not place too much weight on the concierge advice on restaurants. You'd probably do just as well, if not better, to do your own research and selection for restaurants. They were extremely helpful in all other respects, and did make a few good recommendations for restaurants. Salon and massages were available as well (attached to the hotel). Salon (hair) service was great but the massage was mediocre for the price. There are several other \"spas\" in the area as well, but we did not visit them.

We had stayed at the De La Ville once before and felt very happy with our choice to return. We have also stayed at a lot of Intercontinental branded hotels around the world and have more often than not found them first rate. I suspect part of why we stayed at the Intercontinental de la Ville is the brand and an implied level of reliability and accountability if something goes wrong. I would be delighted to be able to put my foot on the nice little once off boutique hotels but that is often a bit hard when in a rush. Mind you this site helps. We think the best thing about the hotel is the service of the staff. They try very hard on all fronts \u2013 directions, suggestions, shops, services etc etc. We arrived on a very early flight from Sydney and they provided us a temporary room to get some much needed rest while we were waiting for our room to become available. They did not charge us for this and that was greatly appreciated. We don\u2019t expect too much in terms of the physical property as, like most places in Rome, it is old and the layout of the whole hotel may not be quite what you would expect for a five star hotel (ie a few nooks and crannies). But the main point is that the rooms are comfortable, well maintained and clean and fresh and just what you need. Not too small either. We had one on the 4th floor looking at an internal courtyard with a nice balcony. Pretty but nothing spectacular. last time we had a room without a balcony looking out over via Sistina and that was a bit more exciting. Breakfast was a buffet (included in room rate) and the service was always good and the food was also delightful. We didn\u2019t want to do too much other than a bit of sightseeing, off to the wedding and a few nice dinners. In terms of sightseeing the concierge offered a few great suggestions for different places to see. Not really off the beaten path but things we had not seen. The restaurant suggestions were delightful, nothing over the top, just nice experiences. We wanted to rent a scooter and the concierge suggested a place just around the corner. The scooter was great, a great way to see Rome very easily, getting lost and going up streets the wrong way is pretty safe and virtually all of the time the traffic is so slow it is not intimidating or hard. The location is quite superb, particularly if you want to do a bit of shopping. Downsides, last time we got nailed with an incredible phone bill, which I complained about and they fixed to a point that whilst still over the top it was fair, given it really was our fault for not paying attention to the cost. So not really that much of a downside. Whilst we have not stayed elsewhere in Rome, it seemed reasonably good value Nice to feel welcome at the hotel.

The fashion district Via Condotti is a ten minute walk from the hotel down the Spanish Steps. We arrived by train at the station Termini and took a taxi to the hotel. The doormen/bellhops are very kind and helpful with your bags or helping you get a taxi. The people who work the desk all speak excellent english. The concierge staff and doormen speak english, too. There were many Americans staying at this hotel. The staff working the desk want to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. My room wasn't ready when I got there at 9am, so they gave me another room to relax in till my room was ready. We crashed for a while and then went out exploring. When we got back our room was ready, our bags had been moved and we had a bottle of Asti Spumanti on ice waiting for us in the room! I had booked the room through Priceline and after reading a few reviews here, I was a little nervous. I asked them if they could upgrade the room and they accomodated my request. I was given a very large room. My mother was with me, and they gave us a suite with two full size beds and a sitting area with sofa/chairs. The room faced the street below, Via Sistina, but it was very quiet. We were on the fourth floor, next to the elevators, but heard no noise. The housekeepers come by at least two times a day to make sure you are happy or need anything. They always made one last stop by in the evening before they went home. You are given a small area in the fridge in which to put your own food. We found a grocery store on Via Condotti and bought groceries (coffee/tea/bread/jam/cheese) and had breakfast in the room every morning to save money. The desk staff were kind enough to find us a kettle and bring us cups/spoons to the room so we could have coffee or tea whenever we wanted in the room. The bathroom was a good size as was the bathtub. The shower was great. Nice slippers and robe provided in the bathroom. They give you lots of towels. The bed linens were very soft and pretty. The airconditioner worked great, too. It is my impression that if you book your hotel room through a discount broker or site like priceline, you are booking the cheapest room the hotel offers. When you get to the hotel, if they can accomodate an upgrade to a nicer room, they are more than happy to do this for you. This hotel is all about customer service and wanting to make your stay in Rome a wonderful experience. So at busy times of the year, you may be stuck with the room you paid for. If you are lucky and the hotel is not full, they will give you a better room. You just have to ask and keep your fingers crossed. When you buy through Priceline or a discount broker, you are never paying for the deluxe/upgrade room. You are paying for the cheapest/no frills room. So don't be mad at them when you get there and this is what you end up with. The manager Giacomo Picca is very attentive, friendly and likes to help whenever he can. Marco at the front desk is also very helpful and gracious. The restaurant and outdoor terrace is absolutely BEAUTIFUL. We had coffee and a snack there and it was heavenly. I would highly recommend a meal or a drink outside on the terrace by the restaurant. If you want to se the Borghese Museum, you have to make reservations before hand, at least 2 days prior. Something else we did was take several tours with enjoyrome.com. They have very educated guides, usually small groups and they are reasonably priced. Take the Jewish Ghetto/Trastevere tour. The tour companies, there are like 2-3 that take you on the bus, were not very good. It may be the only way to get out the catacombs, Tivoli, and D'Este. Otherwise, I would recommend the enjoyrome.com company for your tours. You really can walk everywhere around town once you figure out the lay of the land. Make sure you go to Campo D'Fiori, too. Would be a fantatistic place for dinner...very romantic. Eat at restaurants that are recommended on the web or by the hotel.", "Date": "October 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cI loved the Intercontinental de la Ville experience\u201d", "Author": "SydneyTraveller2000", "ReviewID": "UR20377624", "Content": "I travelled from Australia to Rome and was quite exhausted when I arrived at the Hotel de la Ville. The check-in procedure was quick and easy and even though I had booked my room on the internet I was treated like royalty. The porters took my bags to my room immediately and a staff member accompanied me separately to show me how to use the air-con, etc. If this was indicative of the level of service, I loved it already. I have visited Rome many times and was expecting a tiny room but my room was a pleasant surprise...not huge but certainly generous by Roman standards, especially in such a central position. The hotel is within walking distance of everything, and I mean everything, in Rome. It is just above The Spanish Steps and I was able to walk to all the main tourist attractions..Trevi Fountain, Forum, Colosseum, Pantheon, Piazza Navona, and I even walked home one evening after dinner in Trastevere. It is close to the Metro station (3 mins walk) and it is only 10 mins to The Vatican by train. It is also close to the best shopping street in the world, Via Condotti, as well as great restaurants and coffee bars. Every day the concierge and staff greeted me and they were able to help me with restaurant recommendations as well as information about the train service and time table to Florence. Honestly, nothing was too much trouble and I loved the big umbrella they gave me to use on the one rainy day I had on my trip there. This hotel is not for those who are roughing it, but the prices are very competitive for Rome and the standard of service is far ahed of the others. It can't be beaten for position and the bar is a friendly place to relax with a drink. My whole experience at this hotel was excellent...believe me, it must be good for me to spend time doing this evaluation.

Easy access to the Metro. But for us, that is where the good benefits end. We are members of the Intercontinental's rewards program. So, we didn't pay for our room, we did use points. We were assigned room 436. The room literally was the size of a closet. You could not open the bathroom door all the way, as the bed prevented us from doing so. I am thankful we had only a small suitcase...not sure what we would have done. The bathroom was nicely appointed, and the room itself was OK - but in my opinion, not Intercontinental standards. The bathroom had 5 large mold spots from previously leaks , the wall paper was ripping off the wall next to the bed. On the good side, we did have some great wine, with a lovely view at the Terrace Bar. However, BUYER BEWARE!!!! They do not provide you with drink menus. So, when you order - ask how much in advance. We had 4 glasses and it was 44Euros. Not bad - compared to the lovely couple next to us, who had 2 glasses of red wine. When the bill came, the gentleman asked \"what the hell did we drink for 55 Euros? \" So, just beware. The hotel definitely tries to steer their clients away from the Metro, which I think is a shame. It is so easy to navigate and way safer than risking your life and being overcharged by a Roman Taxi! Overall, great location - needs some work to bring it up to Intercontinental standards.

Cost was an extra 90 Euro a night - so much for the bargain. But again, this is Rome. Upon arrival we noted the tremendous location and amazing terrace with cool view. It was a very nice hotel and the staff were friendly and helpful. The room had a strong perfume smell when we arrived and they assured us that it would dissipate. It did. The cleaners dd not spray again duing our 3 days visit. We walked every where and the sites were tremendous. We ha d a wealth of restaurants in the area as well and we enjoyed seeing the sites. Rome is much like Paris to me in that you really only scratch the surface in a couple days. With a 3yo along, you can't cover as many spots either, espcially with hot temperatures. I would recommend this hotel and go back again. Note that there was a guide book on the book shelves in the lobby area near where the telephone is on the main floor that was helpful. Note too that it is easier getting to this hotel from the subway/tube than the bus. For the subway, you want the station for the Spanish Steps and then go to the top level where the church is.

The sights are magnificent, and the view magnificent (our room overlooked the patio with stautes and had a balcony and table and chairs ot was heaven)and the guest relations managers , Marco Manni in particular was more than accomodating in upgrading us to bigger and more beautiful suites and adjoingng rooms with our kids.

We are a family of two adults and one child who stayed for 3 nights in August 2008. First impressions of the hotel as you enter the lobby are good, however, the hotel doesn\u2019t have that big capital city international hotel feel. It has a more traditional feel. Check in staff were very efficient and spoke excellent English. Every time I visited the front desk there was never a queue. If someone was waiting, a member of staff would quickly appear and deal with them. We had a triple room on the second floor at the front of the hotel. The room was spacious, and classically decorated, like the rest of the hotel. All furniture and soft furnishings were in excellent condition and everything worked perfectly. Air conditioning was quiet and efficient and kept the room cool throughout our stay. I think the bathroom had been recently refit; it was immaculate and stocked with masses of white fluffy towels and high quality toiletries. The room had a mini bar but it was very expensive. My tip would be to walk twenty yards to the mobile cafeteria and stock up on drinks and snacks. You can get beer, wine, soft drinks water etc and they are cheap and chilled. There was one at the top of Spanish Steps just across from the hotel. The buffet breakfast is excellent with an extensive choice, but again quite expensive. I think it was 33 euros for adults but only 6 for children. On its website the hotel claims to have a roof terrace and bar and shows picture of people enjoying a drink or meals on the terrace. However, we found that it was not in use and there were a few tables and chairs dotted around but no staff. Location was a major factor in my decision to choose this hotel. You can walk to most of the major sights, although you may need the metro to get to the Vatican and the Coloseum. There are loads of restaurants within easy walking distance from high-end restaurants on Via Veneto to traditional Pizzerias and pavement caf\u00e9s on the streets off Piazza Spagna and around Trevi Fountain.

My wife & I spent 3 nights at the Intercontinental De La Ville and found it to be a fairly nice place to stay. First it is an excellent location Just a few feet from the Spanish Steps in one Direction and a short walk to several other sites you must see. We were able to walk almost everywhere and just two short blocks away are the Double Decker tour buses -we highly recommend ROMA TOURS the green bus. Both day and then in the evening too. The room we were given was # 515 and it was small like most indicate here - however I had the hotel in Florence call ahead and ask I be given a nice room upgrade & we ended up with a nice little balcony attached. The rooms were very clean and the bath's were small too but real nice. A/C worked great ! and plenty of hot water for shower. The best part of the room is the bedding - it was very nice and comfortable after all day sight seeing and both of us enjoyed that a bunch --As I started to get around the hotel and after the having Continental breakfast that was nice and included . I really started to like the hotel a little more. I wished it included the full breakfast but the cont. was pretty nice. What I am trying to say is the place was pretty nice and has some good features . The staff was a little hard to figure out but I think they were willing to help out when I ask --Breakfast staff was Great. and Breakfast Patio a pleasure to start the day. There is a nice deck patio on six floor --must see & safe in the room -- I ask and was given an iron and board with in minutes ... good service there!, The Area around the hotel has all the nice expensive shops - Kind of the Rodeo Drive of Rome and all right there if you like that kind of stuff. My wife and I turned out enjoying our stay there and would recommend particularly at the Priceline price. We found that both in Rome and in Florence everyone to be very nice and friendly when being treated friendly first & willing to help if ask politely. The only thing I would change about my stay there is the Humidity in July - Full breakfast included and for the hotel to do a little paint touch-up in the rooms nothing major just trim it out a little better. - Include free Internet- and treat all your guest like they have the big money ---- even if they don't. I will say it again God blessed us through out our entire trip to Florence, Tuscany, Cinque Terre and Rome, And made it that all of our hotels and tours and food were all over the top great and we had a wonderful time. The only bad thing I had happen was near the end of trip with a Rip Off Cab driver that took us to airport pulled a quick change of Euros on me and said I only gave him 20 euros when I gave him a 50 and 20 he was easily pleased by giving him my last 5 Euros but it left me money at airport for coffee and that is Bad at 5 am in the morning !

I wanted to stay at the Westin, but it was booked. (We stayed at the Westin in Venice a week before arriving in Rome, and it was great.) Upon arrival, the concierge gentlemen were much nicer than the front desk clerks. Even when we checked out, the front desk didn't say thanks or anything, in fact, they guy took the room key (card) and that was it, and a few days after arriving back home, we received our receipt in the mail. And to top it off, they charged the first night, then voided it out and put it in again- who knows why- and I wasn't going to call since we were home and it was all over with, but, in doing so, of course it changed the euro currency charge each time, and we ended up paying an extra $25.00 due to someone's carelessness. Also, I wanted some change for tips, and the front desk would only give me five one euro coins and no more, saying they couldn't! The room was very overpriced; was plain-reminded us of some hotels in the US. There was a convention of insurance sales people from the US there while we were there, and they were treated better, in my opinion. No one seemed overly friendly to us. Breakfast was very good with a large array of food to choose from, and it was included in the price of our room, but the waiters weren't friendly. The unthinkable happened on our last night in Rome: somehow I left my rather expensive camera in the front seat of a taxi- in tears, I asked the concierge if they could help, and the guy seemed hesitant, but wrote some information down, and said he would call the different taxi companies and I gave him a small tip. Within the hour, I went back to tell him a few more details, and the note that he had written was still just sitting on the desk where anyone could have removed it, and he had not called anyone as of yet. As we were leaving the next morning, there was another guy at the desk who showed me the original note, and it had check marks on it as if the taxi companies were called but no luck.

Our main priority were location as we planned to walk everywhere. We also wanted a room larger than the standard hotel room as we were travelling with our two year old boy who needs a bit of space to play. My husband and I chose the Intercontinental with some hesitation after reading the different reviews on this site. It seems that you have to choose the top end suites at this hotel in order to get even a reasonable price performance. We went for a junior suite but did not get much quality for the piles of euros we paid. We did get quite a few square meters but the layout of the room was very strange and neither convenient nor cosy. The room was shaped like a very long corridor with the sleeping area bulging out at the end. A lot of space wasted. The room (106) was on the first floor and facing a very dark inner courtyard. The TV cupboard blocked one of the two windows entirely and the room was very dark. The bathroom was small and not luxurious. We asked the reception whether this actually was the best room they could offer us and they insisted that this junior suite was among their best. Pros -Location. Perfect for shopping and fine for sightseeing. We walked everywhere but as Rome is pretty small many other hotels could have given us the same possibilities. - The general manager and some of the staff were very nice and welcoming. To bad that this is not the general code of conduct at this hotel - The room service food was very expensive - but excellent and generous. - The hotel facilitated a late check out when our little boy became ill. Cons Apart from the room being dark and generally disappointing. - The air conditioner was very noisy but not very efficient - we dread to think about how hot our room had been had it been July or August. - Additional prices for wireless, movies, room service charge etc. were outrageous and higher than what we have experienced in true 5-star hotels. - D\u00e9cor wise The Intercontinental relies heavily on chintz and heavy gold frames but its not really grand or elegant there are simply too many shabby details. - Movies could only be seen in the not very cosy hallway part of the room which had a flat screen. The older TV in the cupboard could not offer this functionality. - Breakfast buffet was unorganised. Service at breakfast was very inconsistent. There was a 50/50 split in our opinion of the waiters, Some of them were hardworking and service minded and you could see that they were pulling the load - other waiters were disorganised and not mentally present . Some mornings we really had to struggle to get our coffee. - The heavy perfumed spray of air freshener house keeping used in our room. In conclusion we will not return to The Intercontinental. It is not a bad hotel but price performance is simply too low and the overall impression is not even near 5 star..", "Date": "June 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cquite nice, beautifully located\u201d", "Author": "awdub", "ReviewID": "UR16679213", "Content": "We stayed here just one evening at the end of a trip to Italy for a friend's wedding.

The De La Ville was the most expensive lodging and the lowlight of our trip. While the location was excellent, at the top of the Spanish Steps, the hotel has seen much better days. We booked a triple executive suite with terrace. The room rate was $677 Euro plus tax, no breakfast included. The only saving grace of the stay was the free night I received being an Ambassador Club member which averaged the nightly rate to be tolerable. Check in was fast and efficient so no problems there. Porters were available to assist with luggage and offered to show us the room amenities (how to open the terrace door) so no problem there either. The single largest disappointment was the \u201ccity view\u201d terrace which looked straight on to a large construction crane at the building across the small street. While there were views, they were mostly obstructed by the crane. The terrace was absolutely filthy and there were no cushions for the terrace chairs. Not a single plant or greenery which could have helped the dismal terrace. I realize the hotel is very old and I didn\u2019t expect modern fittings and furnishings but I did expect that the room would have been renovated or at least updated in the last 50 years. Chipped and very stained furniture. The carpet could very well be original. The small sitting couch was so bad that I draped towels over it to sit. The room smelled horrible and the overly floral room spray they used to mask the smell made it worse. We had the windows open the entire stay to air the room out. After two days, the smell was as strong as when we entered. The smell lingered up and down the halls and on the terrace when other rooms had their doors or windows open. Luckily, we chased the maid out of the room the second morning before she could spray any more of that horrible stuff. Bedding was OK but lumpy however the pillows were wonderful (welcome after the hard pillows in the other locations) and the comforter was soft and fluffy. A small roll-away bed was available for my niece but was so short that her feet hung over the end (she is very petite). I can\u2019t imagine an older or larger child sleeping on the cot. The mattress pad on the cot was a bath towel. Bathroom was small and cramped and had we wanted to use the bidet, it would have been a trick in acrobatics as the door completely blocked it. The tub was very narrow and was fitted with the standard handheld shower. The water was adjustable, hot and good water pressure. Toiletries were above average. Service by the concierge was snotty at best. We didn\u2019t ask for much assistance other than the location of the Ferragamo store which was such a nuisance that we just gave up and wandered Via Condotti still we found it. We did not eat at the hotel and only had drinks our last evening on the 6th floor terrace. Service was average if not a bit slow. It took 20 minutes to be acknowledged and there were only three other tables occupied. Prices were as expected and no different than any other hotel in a large city \u2013 US or Europe. I had such high expectations for this hotel and our last two nights in Italy and sadly, they were not met. Yes, the location is fabulous but there are other hotels in the area that I would try before ever staying at the De La Ville again. We very much enjoyed Rome (I have been multiple times, first visit for my niece)\u2026we had fabulous meals (off the tourist tracks with the exception of Imago at The Hassler which was horrible), we wandered for hours enjoying the sites and had wonderful service from very warm people (exception was the hotel).

At the base of the Steps, the Rodeo Drive of Rome! Gucci, Prada and other the others! Arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by a doorman who led us to the front desk. The staff at the front desk were pleasant and the check in process was very quick. I had read a review about the small rooms on the 3rd floor, and sure enough, we were on the 3rd floor. When we entered the room, it was very small, yet from what I have read and been told by other travelers to Rome, most rooms are small. Overlooking the minor detail of size, we were VERY happy about the location. The room and bathroom were very clean, the bed was comfortable with big pillows, and the robes and slippers were a nice touch. The hotel has a bar and restaurant in addition to a rooftop patio. We were unable to see the rooftop patio as it rained most of the time we were there. We didn't eat at the restaurant, yet we stopped in the bar on a few nights. The prices at the bar were ridiculous, so if you're a budget traveler, visit the local eateries, pubs or markets. We had dinner the first night, and many nights after at a local place called L'Enoteca on Via Della Croce 76/B. This is an absolute must as the food, wine and desserts are phenomenal! It is walking distance from the hotel and two blocks from the Spanish Steps. The hotel is also close to the metro or subway which gives you access to most of the city.

At check in, I decided not to stay and quickly made a call to the Intercontinental De La Ville Roma and asked to speak to management as I had stayed there before. At that point, Giacomo Pica, the Duty Manager, spoke with me and I explained my dilemma of not having a room and wanting to stay at the Intercontinental, however I was concerned with the price. May I say, that we negotiated a very fair price and I then went to the Hotel to verify our stay. I had left our bags at the other Hotel and Giacomo Pica personally escorted me by taxi, to the other Hotel to collect our luggage. My mother in law remained at the Intercontinental and rested in a lovely lounge area and was offered complimentary drinks \u2013 how lovely of them!! We were penalized by the other hotel for one night, but we thought it was worth it after we were given so much attention by the Intercontinental. This is a huge thank you to Giacomo Pica who was not only a gentleman, but an inspiration to all his staff who only spoke kind respectful words about it. It is so refreshing and lovely as a traveler to come across such wonderful management who have positions of importance and who use it to benefit people like ourselves.

There were only two suites on this floor, 839 and 840, the Penthouse Presidential suite which we were lucky enough to have taken a peek into - not overly huge but loverly with a fire place and a piano in the sitting area. Thus, with only one neighbour, suite 839 was a relatively quiet place to stay (that is, other than the occasional elevator noises, quite loud in the bathroom but not so in the bedroom). This suite was also directly next door to a terraced suite of the Hotel Hassler, since we could even see their chairs and tables on the terrace but we were propably paying a third of the Hassler's rates, for the same location and the same great views of old Rome. The views of Rome from the front terrace was simply magical as you could see as far as the St Peter's, Pantheon, Vittoria Emmanuel etc. Walk a few steps in the opposite direction, there is yet another terrace offering the view of the Borghese Gardens and of the Hotel De la Ville's beautiful internal courtyard. Simply wonderful!!! Like someone had said earlier about this hotel, the special features of the Hotel De la Ville are its great location and terraces' views. If you miss the suites with terrace, it would really be such a waste when you are in Rome, well, at least in my humble opinion. The canopied bed in the suite was simply a good King sized one, with an oh-so comfy mattress. We had a good two nights sleep here (22-24 Dec). Surprisingly, the bedroom area was not that huge for an Executive suite with terrace but good enough for a short stay. A big Philips TV and Kenwood Hi-fi system completes the picture. Breakfast was superb, since this is a big hotel, both choices and food quality were very good, they even had made-to-order pancakes, which I rarely see in hotels in Europe. Coffee was like plain water though, ask for an Expresso instead! Though the hotels' entrance and reception area are nothing to write home about, don't be fooled. Take a lift up to its second floor and you would soon realise its beauty lies very much within the hotel and not outside the hotel. The Restaurant La Piazzetta, the adjoining Bar area and the two courtyards (rare in Rome) are simply very mind calming in hectic Rome. Both foilage and fountain in the Courtyard are really beautiful, too. Now, about the small negatives. Even in an Executive suite, there was only one toilet with one sink, with no showers. This could easily waste some good 15-20 minutes every morning since only one person could use the toilet at any one time. And between the bedroom and the closet area and the toilet, there is a ''submerged portion'', which could act as a trap to unwitting guests. Be very careful, esp. going to the toilet late at night. In fact, we were only at this hotel for its terrace's views. The location is not one of the best in all of Rome. It is great for shopping though, if you are really into it. But prices on luxury items are not cheap by European standards and contrary to what was written in tour guide books, there was no Christmas sales ....sales only starts from January 6th, we were told! Facing the Spanish Steps could also mean its not the quiestest place to sleep. But fortunately, we were on a very high floor and the beds were very comfortable, that is why we had slept a good solid 8 hours before our 13 hour flight back to Singapore. If I were to stay at this hotel again, I wouldn't mind opting for an Executive Junior suite with terrace to courtyard views, hopefully , for more peace and quiet. About restaurants, we asked where we could have an oven baked pizza and the conceirge had pointed us to a Le Grotta nearby. Pizzas there were great, but its 10 euros per plate of antipasto, and its beautiful decor are what really makes this restaurant a cut above the rest. Overall, the Intercontinental De La Ville is a really good value, good quality hotel in a central shopping area. If you book one of its bigger rooms (the complaints here seems to be from those who book their cheapest/smallest room category), you are unlikely to be disappointed. I felt that by choosing this hotel, we really got our money's worth, though not always the case in expensive Rome. Last but not the least, our special thanks to Maura from the Reservation Dept.

It was a generally good stay, but few things in this life are perfect. The room I had was small, but fine, and the rate, through Priceline, was good. I had requested a nonsmoking room with a king bed, and it was ready when I arrived in the late morning. That was great! The bathroom was large and well appointed. The room was smallish, but for a single person it was fine, with a good desk and reading chair. Linens and towels were wonderful. And the air conditioning was great -- easily adjustable, and a life saver in the hot Roman August afternoon. A few quibbles. 1) Location. Many reviewers love the location. I didn't. If you are primarily interested in the archaeology and museum aspect of Rome, as distinct perhaps from the shopping aspect, this is a fairly out of the way location. I was very happy that there is an elevator most of the way to the top at the entrance to the Spagna Metro station. There is nothing the hotel can do about this, but next time I will look for something a little more central. 2) Everything they can charge costs extra: No coffee maker, and expensive water, colas, etc. in the mini-bar. Breakfast buffet, bar and restaurant are likewise in the upper upper price range. Wifi is 23 Euros per day for unlimited access, 13 Euros for an hour (9 if you use the computer in the elevator lobby). 3) Housekeeping: Bed making and bathroom cleaning were efficient and well done, but I noticed that the same pieces of lint remained on the carpet throughout my stay, and that socks got very dirty walking on the carpet. I do not believe that it was vacuumed once while I was there. The carpets badly need professional deep cleaning. I can only imagine what they must be like on the smoking floors! 4) Room furnishing: The room had a closet with hangers, but no drawers or shelves to put clothes on, so one was forced to live out of one's suitcase. 5) Concierge: The concierge staff was almost always helpful, especially the older and more experienced ones, who gave good restaurant recommendations. However, I came down with a mild one-day-disabling food-induced stomach problem, identical to many that have been easily resolved with Pepto Bismol in the past. Of course, I had forgotten to bring it. So I, in some evident distress, asked the young concierge on duty where an open pharmacy might be. He described the location of one in detail. I went there, but did not find it. I had to backtrack and search through the Spagna area to find one. It was evident that this younger concierge either did not have detailed knowledge of the area, or could not communicate it to me. The pharmacy I eventually found did not have Pepto Bismol, did not speak English, and my Italian was not adequate to the task. That was not the hotel's fault, of course. It was a very unpleasant day.

We were familiar with the InterContinental brand from the property in NYC and therefore had high expectations. These were fueled by the price of the rooms in Rome. Unfortunately, the InterContinental in Rome did not meet our expectations and proved a poor value for what we paid. Our check-in involved a long wait, ostensibly because of a new electronic system. The lobby seemed chaotic with many guests checking in at once and too few (very conscientious and hard-working) bellmen to help. The room (a superior double) was comfortably spacious for 2 adults but seemed \"tired\" and in need of a refurbishment. The marble bathroom was quite large, up to date, well appointed with top-shelf amenities, and plentifully supplied with towels. The room was serviced only once a day, a drawback considering that an evening shower is essential before dinner at the end of a full day of sightseeing in the Roman summer heat. However, the bathroom and bedroom were kept spotless by the cleaning staff. The bed was a real back-breaker. My husband and I both had considerable back pain in the morning, and we are in reasonably good physical shape. Our room faced the interior courtyard. One night there was a dinner event in the courtyard that went on until after 1:00 am and kept us awake. The dinner guests were extremely loud. A call to the desk had no effect. I was amazed that the hotel booked a large, noisy party for that hour in a public area. I agree with other reviewers that the music on the roof terrace is a terrible distraction from the glorious view of Rome at night--including St. Peter's all aglow in the distance. We also agree with reviewers who found the desk staff unfriendly and unhelpful. Two caveats: first, the hotel was overrun with rude and demanding Americans accompanied by their teenagers-with-attitude, so one can understand why the desk personnel might be a bit cold against such an onslaught. Second, the bellmen, doormen, and jr concierge staff were very friendly and helpful, despite being obviously overworked. One wonders whether the imposition of US management practices (eg, lean staffing) is a factor in the shortcomings of this property, since an Italian-owned hotel in the 4-5 star range where we stayed in Florence had none of these drawbacks. On the plus side: the location is excellent. On the minus side: the breakfast buffet is exactly the same every day, so there's no variety for guests staying for a week (as we did) with the breakfast-inclusive rate. Also, this hotel hosts cruise ship passengers, so at times it resembles a ferry terminal. If I were to visit Rome again, I would look for a smaller hotel closer either to the Via Venetto or the ancient part of the city.

Beware of rose giving non-italians at the Spanish steps, they just want your money, tell them to take their rose and get lost and eventually they will stop pestering you and your significant other. - Hike up the hill past the Spanish Steps and continue up the hill to the Villa Borgesi for an outstanding view of the Vatican and a relaxing park. - View from hotel roof restaurant/cafe is also worth a look. - Close to all kinds of shopping. Thumbs Down - Our breakfast experience at the hotel restaurant was unpleasant. Wait staff took forever to serve us and the food left little to be desired.

I believe the rates for May were around 400 Euro per night ... maybe down into the 300 Euro ranges for some of the smaller rooms. I of course, got a small room because although I am a platinum member ... they had no upgrades for me ... probably because I didn't pay $125 to join their Intercontinental Hotels Ambassador program ... which guarentees an upgrade. (another traveler told me that this 'upgrade' is sometimes just a higher floor and is not worth the money. The room was small ... expected for Rome ... had nice furnishings and a window, which looked out on the small patio area. If you get a room which looks over the patio area ... switch rooms (if you can)!!! There is a bar out there that is open until 2 a.m. and you can clearly hear loud talking and then the loud noises of the staff dragging the heavy metal furniture around at closing. They said the hotel was full and they could not move me. There is a BEAUTIFUL terrace on the 6th floor which overlooks the entire city of Rome. They call this the 'Emperor's Terrace' This would be an ideal place to have a cigar or cigarette or just relax and read a book. The catch is that they lock the terrace anytime that there is not a bartender outside who charges you 10 Euros to make you a weak drink. You cannot go outside on this terrace to look at the view unless you buy a drink ... which means it is only open from late afternoon to early evening. What a shame as this would be such a beautiful area to enjoy a view without paying 10 Euro per drink and listening to a bad guitarist. There is no club lounge at this hotel ... many Intercontinental hotels have club lounges where you can relax, get a free newspaper and evening h'orderves. It is clear that this hotel is all about getting your money (even after you overpay for the quality of the room) and gives you nothing other than the mass produced slippers in the bathroom (where you literally can bearly sit on the toilet because it is wedged in between the sink and the wall ... it is literally comical.) All in all, this was not a bad hotel. It was not a good hotel. There are several 'non-name' brand hotels within a few miles which would offer similar service and decor at half the price. If you want much better accomodations, they are there for the same price. The location of being at the top of the Spanish steps and right next to Via Veneto is great ... however I was dissapointed that the Spanish steps is full of drunken 14 year olds and counterfeit bag salesmen past 10 o'clock at night. Also ... WATCH OUT FOR THE CAB DRIVERS WHO HANG OUT BY THIS HOTEL! Mine pretended to be lost in order to bump the ride up by 5 Euros and then magically remembered the way.

My husband and I stayed there 3 nights in August 2006 for our honeymoon. The service was horrible. First, I e-mailed the hotel concierge numerous times before our trip asking certain questions and asking for a nicer room since it was our honeymoon. My inquiries were flatly ignored, never got a single response. Mind you, I e-mailed them in English AND Italian. Second, once we arrived, we were stuffed into what looked like a prison cell. So much for the honeymoon romance \uf04c. Keep in my, my husband is a Platinum Member with the priority club, so we really expected a good treatment. Literally, there was no space to even turn around. I understand that the building is old and yada yada yada. I am myself originally from Europe and was not expecting a room with the \u201cAmerican proportions.\u201d However, this room was super tiny and definitely something completely opposite from a honeymoon dream room. Finally, after numerous inquiries we were moved to a larger room, which still was not great. Third, the staff was snobbish and unprofessional. There are NO alarm clocks in the rooms, so we had to place a wake up call every day. One time they failed to call us, and because of that we were running late to a guided tour in Vatican. After much argument, the staff finally called us a cab and paid for it so we could make it to the tour. Moreover, my husband needed an internet access for one day. The concierge quoted him one price, but when there was time to pay, we go a bill for of course a much larger amount. Granted, the location is good if this is your first visit to Rome and you are staying only 3-4 nights in Rome. I do not think it is worth though shedding over $500 per night for a prison cell, especially since you are out sight-seeing all day. Our honeymoon was saved because we stayed the other 2 nights at Hilton Cavallieri Hotel in Rome. The Cavallieri is a heaven on earth and this is where we will stay next time when in Rome.

I chose the InterContinental for its location, because we had enjoyed the Madrid property, and because of TA reviews/forum comments. It served its purpose admirably, but I'd say the quality and value were not quite equal to the Madrid property. Rome can be a very expensive place--more so than Hawaii (site of many sticker shock comments in other TA forums I frequent). We booked and prepaid several monthis in advance, via the InterContinental website. I'd noticed that this property did not guarantee \"nonsmoking\" rooms, so after I made the reservation I called InterContinental's reservations number and inquired...they put in a \"medical request\" for a nonsmoking room with special cleaning (asthma). When we arrived, the desk clerk said our room was not quite ready because it was undergoing 'deep cleaning for the medical request' and suggested we have a complimentary drink and come back in 40 minutes. The rooftop bar was not open (it was about 2 PM), so we went to the nice 2nd-floor terrace area and had our drinks. The room was ready when promised...smallish but acceptable for 2 people, with a tiny balcony overlooking a not-very-scenic inner courtyard. The main \"flaw\" in the room is common to the InterContinental chain's furniture--too few drawers for clothing. The room was exceptionally clean and fresh smelling (carpets had been shampooed) and the housekeeping was immaculate during our stay. The hotel was quiet, felt very safe, and had good service. The concierge had taken a while (with apology) to get back to us on our emails for restaurant reservation requests but we did get our first choices and the reservations were in good order. The second floor restaurant breakfast was 33 euros for the buffet, or about 20 euros for the \"continental.\" However, it was good variety and quality, if not a super value. The morning we left we had very early room service (add 10 euros for delivery) and ate on our terrace; service was timely and the food was good. If we had stayed longer or had only wanted a light breakfast (we skip lunch, so the expensive buffet was a decent expenditure compromise) we would have explored the nearby cafes. The weak point from our perspective (did not bring laptop on this trip) was that the \"business services\" had only one computer for use (oversubscribed) and you had to pay for and use access time in 30-minute blocks (no saving time to use later). I think the time block system may be an artifact of Italian Internet laws, because the clerk here mentioned they had to record our passport number and time of use... The hotel is close to the elite shopping district down at the foot of the Spanish Steps (looked, did not buy) and a nice walk via the Trevi Fountain to the Forum, etc. We were happy to find out that it was still \"free week\" for the monuments (we had gone to Pompeii and Herculaneum on \"free week\" earlier in the trip). It is a short walk to the Borghese Gardens, for strolling or running. Overall, was pleased with the hotel but might try a different location on another trip to Rome. Would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a clean, comfortable, quality place with good service near the Steps and the Borghese Gardens.", "Date": "May 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "L.A.CA.USA", "Title": "\u201cCelebrity status has not gone to their head\u201d", "Author": "URBANPAINTMAN", "ReviewID": "UR7638166", "Content": "Having hosted most of the accomodations for the guests of Tom and Kate's wedding extravaganza I know why this hotel was chosen for this high profile crowd.

As Ambassador Platinum Elite members, there was the usual separate check-in facilities and room upgrade - all done with very little fuss which made us feel quite at home immediately. The concierge staff were very good although they had not responded to an email I sent them a few days before the trip. Filippo helped us with a number of restaurant reservations and bookings for the Galleria Borghese. The hotel is very well located with well-kept rooms. We had an interesting problem with our bathroom, in that the water pressure from the in-built shower was very poor but that was the opposite with the shower head attached to the bath taps! Also note that the walls (and floors) can be a little thin. On a number of mornings, I was convinced my fellow guests from the next room was having a shower in my bathroom! Air-conditioning worked fine in our room and we didn't hear much of the street noise from the 4th floor with the windows shut. It was my birthday during our stay there and the hotel provided a cake, which we took up to the terrace on the 6th floor and indulged in a couple of glasses of champagne! A few tips if you are staying here - if you get tired of having to clamber up the Spanish Steps, there is a lift that is not very visible you could use. As you enter Spagna metro station from the bottom of the Spanish Steps, it located to the right. The best way to find it is to use the metro entrance at the top of the Spanish Steps, which is essentially only for access to the lift. Second tip is if, like us, your package does not include breakfast, do NOT eat at the Trinita cafe bar which is just down the road (Via Sistina) from the hotel. Twenty two Euros for two croissants, two coffees and a glass of orange juice. It's fine for a coffee at the counter but the moment you sit down at a table, the prices go through the roof. Instead, head down Via Sistina towards the Tritone Fountain. There is cafe bar there called Pepys with the most visually stunning display of sandwiches in the windows. Plus coffee at the counter for 1.50 euros!

Our children (ages 8, 13, 16) have traveled with us before to London and Paris quite successfully due in large part to the fact that we were able to find the right hotel. We have found that the best hotel for us should have the following characteristics: 1. Great location for walking to many of the sites we want to visit. 2. Great location for walking to nice, but less expensive restaurants. 3. Clean rooms and clean public areas of hotel. 4. Good room service for quiet breakfasts. 5. Helpful Concierge for making reservations/recommendations. 6. A feeling that children are welcome at the hotel, but the hotel isn't overrun by unsupervised children. 7. Huge tour groups do not take over the hotel. The Hotel de la Ville Intercontinental nicely met all of our criteria. The hotel is in a wonderful location at the top of the Spanish Steps and close to the park. The Steps get noisy and crowded with local teens at night, but the Hotel is not affected by the noise or crowds since it is set back a bit from the Steps. (These teens are well-behaved for the most part - this is just a place they seem to use a meeting place). There are many restaurants (and most importantly for kids, gelato stores) to choose from in walking distance and if you like to shop (we don't) there are many high-end shops at the base of the Steps. If you need a taxi from time to time there is a taxi stand nearby that normally has many taxis waiting for riders. You can have the Hotel grab one or go get one yourself. Since we have five people we needed a cab capable of taking five people (most cabs only take 4) and being close to a taxi stand was helpful in quickly finding a suitable cab. Arriving at the Hotel you will pehaps be surprised that there is no grand entrance - the Hotel is on a narrow street that requires the cab to pull up on the sidewalk to let you out. The lobby is also small and understated. If you are looking for a big, glitzy hotel you are at the wrong spot. The Hotel is instead intimate and quiet (the way we like it). The rooms are small (as most are in Rome), but clean and attractive. The bathrooms are small but upscale in fixtures and finishes. The public areas are clean and well-maintained. The main restaurant for breakfast and lunch is very nice, with room outside in a courtyard when the weather is warm. The Terrace was not available for use in March, so I cannot comment on it. The morning breakfast buffet is fantastic (although expensive if not already included in your room rate), and the room service is fast and nicely presented. The Concierge desk is a mix of personalities and levels of expertise. All of the Concierges were polite with good English skills. They arranged a tour guide for the Vatican (I called several days in advance of our arrival to arrange) and helped with dinner recommendations and reservations each night (only one suggestion was poor - a touristy spot with not much ambience). The overall feeling at the hotel was quite comfortable for a family- relaxed, no noise and commotion, and well-behaved young guests.

None of us could say enough about the concierge. Kudos to the hotel management for such a fine staff. Our room price included breakfast in the garden restaurant which was very good. We ate breakfast there every morning. The breakfast food selections included just about everything you could possibly think of to eat for breakfast. We had two \"minor\" problems during our stay at the Intercontinental. Our room was on the seventh floor, just under the executive suite. The executive suite has a grand piano in it, which when played, can be heard quite well in the junior suite below. Thankfully, we only had that \"noise\" problem one night and whomever played the piano stopped playing by 10:00 p.m. Other than that, both of our suites were very quiet. Also, on two mornings we awoke early (5:45 and 6:15 a.m.) to catch some early tours. Unfortunately, the hot water tank for our room wasn't quite awake, yet, and I ended up taking very quick, cold showers both mornings. A front desk staff member told me, \"demand for hot water is a problem,\" but I don't know if it is just for that room, floor, or what.

We stayed there in April 2007, for Easter week, two adults and a 10 year old child. For our Italy trip, with stops in various cities, I priced hotels through various means, including consolidators like Expedia and Travelocity, certain smaller booking websites, and correspondence with the hotels directly (either by e-mail or telephone). In this particular case I found the best deal at the Intercontinental de la Ville Roma by booking directly with the hotel. Actually, when I telephoned the hotel, they told me that I could get an even better rate my making the reservation online at the hotel\u2019s web site. I much appreciated that tip. The hotel is in a great location at the top of the Spanish Steps, and thus the metro stop is just a couple of minutes walk away. I had e-mailed the hotel that this was a special trip for my 10 year old daughter\u2019s birthday, and requested that they assign us a nice room. For my daughter\u2019s birthday, the hotel had upgraded us to an executive suite at no extra charge. The rooms bedroom and living room were a little small, but actually quite large by Rome standards. We also had a large balcony overlooking the city. Also, after we registered and went up to the room, we had not even been in the room for 20 minutes when a waiter appeared with a birthday cake for my daughter and a bottle of champagne on ice for us, sent by the hotel manager. Then the manager telephoned a bit later to wish my daughter happy birthday, and to offer his personal services for anything else we might need. The next day the manager sent us another bottle of champagne on ice with his best wishes for an enjoyable visit. A couple of evenings later, when we happened to run across the manager, and thanked him for his consideration, he invited us up for a drink at a quiet hotel bar. Also, on our first evening, we asked the manager if it was possible to get tickets for Easter services in the Vatican (barely 12 hours later). He thought it was impossible but was then able to secure them for us! The hotel has an extremely nice restaurant, with a great menu. The breakfast service is quite extensive. There is an interior shaded courtyard which is a great place for a drink or afternoon tea. There is also a rooftop terrace restaurant and bar with a great view over the city.

When we arrived at the hotel we were told that we had standard suite on the 3rd floor, as they said their executive suites didn't have doors.

We also had an email from Guest Relations confirming an Executive suite with one bedroom and a separate sitting room with door. We were a little disappointed that this was not going to be the case, but thought that the room would be lovely nonetheless. When we did get to access to our room, we were again disappointed. While it was a relatively spacious room, it was rather dark and unimpressive, but the most disappointing aspect was that there was no door separating the lounge and bedroom areas.

Yes there was some construction across the street. But heck we were thrilled with the room and the view\u2014especially for the price. All of the staff was friendly and helpful. It is hard to pick anyone out. The concierge made our reservations, the doorman greeted us with a smile, the front desk was efficient, the maid had our room made up when we came back from siteseeing and again when we got back from dinner. Ok, what can I criticize? Well the bathroom was small, but the room as a whole was significantly larger than the equivalent room at the Intercontinental in Paris. Actually there is another point there to be expanded upon. The Intercontinental in Paris is much more of a big chain hotel with wide hallways and large elevators. The Intercontinental in Rome feels much more like a local hotel. The elevator is one of those tiny European ones, the lobby is small and intimate, and the hallways are narrow and broken by turns and stairs. What else? This was our first trip to Rome. We were told the top of the Spanish Steps was \u201cthe\u201d place to stay. I do not think I agree. If I had it to do over, I might have preferred to be near the Pantheon. It seemed to me like that might have been more central for sightseeing, and we frequently seemed to end up in that area for dinner. But my wife felt like the Spanish steps area was perfect. She thought the Pantheon area was too touristy and crowded.

OK- First let me say, that I got a really good deal on this hotel. I got this hotel reservation via Priceline for $186 a night. The same day I booked the room, the lowest price on the website was 220 Euro. So as you can see, this was a considerable saving- about $100 less per night. The location is a few strides away from the top of the Spanish steps. Really very close. The Hassler is at the top and this is about 3 doors down. Note: If you are taking the Metro here.. the Spagna metro has an elevator to the top of the steps. Check in was easy. No problems with the reservation. Room: Nice size room for a large city. Same size as say NYC or Paris. Enough room to move around, a desk, little table for odds & ends, TV, a suitcase stand. Large beautiful wooden closet with wooden hangers. You'll probably need more hangers than they give you to hang your clothes. TV comes in a number of different languages. There were about 5 channels in English, but only news. The Bed: The linens were lovely. The bed came with 4 pillows. 2 firm and 2 soft. Although as someone mentioned before, the large bed is actually 2 singles pushed together. We were so tired from sightseeing all day.. this was not a problem. Windows... We were on the 4th floor. The view across the street was of a building swaddled in construction work, but you could see a lot of the sky. The windows are 2 parts. Inside and outside,which kept the room was fairly quiet. Bathroom: Very nice. Big deep tub for taking baths. Toilet & Bidet. Came with 2 bathrobes & 2 pairs of slippers. Also the bathroom had a scale, shoe mitt, big container of cotton balls, a 2 sided mirror arm for shaving or makeup application & hairdryer. The bathroom was all marble and the mirror was treated to not fog when you take you shower. Very Nice. Service: We didn't ask for much help, so we can't attest to this. Sometimes there was a smartly dressed doorman to open the door, but most times we came in out, we were able to push the revolving door for ourselves.

The room was bigger than a lot of American hotels that I have stayed in. The bathroom was very large and had all of the amenities that I needed. The only real complaint I had about the room was that we reserved a king size bed and they had just pushed together two twin beds. This was not that big of a deal because we weren't in the room for a large amount of time. This was a very special trip for us as I proposed to my girlfriend on this trip. I made the conceirge aware of this because I had some questions about confirming dinner reservations and they treated us even better. We returned to the room one evening and there was a bottle of chapagne waiting in the room from the hotel general manager. On the night of the proposal, I had the conceirge send up some flowers to be in the room after we returned from dinner. These flowers were better than I expected and my fiance' was astounded. We were actually in Rome at the time that Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise were getting married and they were staying at the Hotel Hassler next door.

We did breakfast through room service and they were accurate and punctual. Really, I can find itsy bitsy things to complain about even on the best trips but this hotel was outstanding. The staff has mastered knowing when to leave you alone and when to take care of you and the concierge and doorman were esp. excellent.

(Not one taxi driver knew what I was talking about when I said \"Intercontinental\" Hotel de la Ville so it seems to be better known to locals without the global brand name attached.) What a terrific hotel. I was assigned a room on the 5th floor facing the inside patio which serves as the hotel breakfast room and bar. There is a nice lounge singer most nights and the music, which stopped promptly at 11:30 pm each night, was pleasant to hear in my room. The patio was also a terrific spot to start the day with breakfast (very nice buffet) and end the day with a cocktail. The room was tiny but I was paying a very good corporate rate. We had two twin beds pushed together. While there was a fairly nice sized closet with safe, the entire dresser was actually a disguised mini bar. I would have preferred a drawer for my socks and underwear. Room was elegant and spotless. However, there really was only about a foot of space to walk around the bed and walls/furnishings. Given the rate and luxury of the property, I was perfectly happy. Location also cannot be beat. You are on top of the Spanish Steps which puts you within minutes of the top sites of Rome (i.e. 5 minutes walk to the Trevi Fountain) and its best shopping as well. It is also convenient to the Borgese area and Via Veneto for dining and evening options, many of which are less tourist focused. The only downside is that after a day of walking in Rome, which was very hot, you may not be in the mood to climb the Steps. The Steps are also a congregation point for everyone it seems at night and I was there during World Cup Quarterfinals and it was the center of celebrations. Hint - the subway is down a narrow street just next to the Steps and there is an elevator to take you to the top. Two of five nights I was lazy and took the elevator. The hotel has a single computer in the lobby for internet use and it was always busy (morning, noon and night) even though a password is assigned to guests with a 20-minute usage limit. Bring your laptop if you need to access email, etc. The hotel staff was great other than the concierge staff. The concierge staff seem generally cranky when asked for the Internet password for the lobby computer, directions, restaurant advice or a map. When we checked out at 7 a.m., no one even bothered to help us get a taxi. The bellman, doorman and concierge were enjoying the cool lobby on that hot Rome morning. I would think rooms facing the street would be noisy as I was surprised at the volume of traffic, including big trucks, that went racing down the cobble stoned street.

First, the hotel could not have been in a more convenient location. (At the top of the Spanish Steps, which is within walking distance to great shopping and restaurants.) We walked to and from the Vatican, to and from several museums, and when we couldn't walk, it was easy to get a taxi from the centrally located hotel. Our flight arrived from the US around 7a.m., and I had emailed the hotel concierge a few days prior to our arrival to see if we could have an early check in that morning. They hotel staff quickly replied and said that they would do their best to have a room ready, but because the hotel was at capacity, they couldn't guarantee they'd have a room ready that early in the a.m. We were pleasantly suprised to learn when we arrived that our room was ready for us. It was nice to be able to drop the bags off, have a place to freshen up after the long flight, and then hit the streets for our first day of sight-seeing. We found the front desk staff to be very polite and cordial, but it was the service of the concierge staff that was so exceptional! Any question we had about a restaurant, the location of a particular store, etc, they promptly answered. The concierge staff made dinner reservations for us each night, and they were even able to get us reservations for New Years eve at the last minute! (Ask for Daniel at the Concierge desk when you go. He's the best!) We stayed in a Deluxe room, that was not exactly large by American hotel room standards, but much larger than some European hotel rooms I've stayed in before. The room had a great view of the hotel's inner courtyard, complete with a small balcony with a cafe table and chairs and flower boxes. The housekeeping staff came daily, and were very friendly in passing in the hallways. They even came back each evening to turn down the beds.

What led us originally to book here was the great location at the top of the Spanish Steps and the close shopping and dining of Via del Condotti and Via Veneto. It was also a very pleasant 15 minute walk to the Galleria Borghese through the Villa Borghese Park (Rome's version of NYC's Central Park but much more peaceful and clean). It was very nice to have that large spot of green grass and trees so close to the hotel for a respite from central Rome's busy streets and sounds. We were orginally assigned a room fronting on Via Sistina as we had asked for city view. The room was nicely sized and had two sets of windows, one normal set outside and one set on the inside for soundproofing. When both windows were closed it was quiet but the temps approached the 60's and we opened them for some cooler fresh air and it was pretty noisy. So we asked and were moved after two nights in this room to one located on the interior courtyard. Very nice and quiet with the windows open! The bathrooms are very spacious with marble flooring, bidet and a deep tub that was great for soaking. Room service (ice, food, luggage etc) was very speedy and always courteous. The front desk and concierge were just as efficient and helpful. The Coliseum, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill are all within a 20-25 minute walk from the hotel which we did for exercise and a chance to see the city up close. The balance of the travel we did by cab although there is a very close Metro stop near the Piazza di Spagna. Vatican City is also about a 10 minute cab ride from the hotel. Quite nice was the fact that there was a cab stand in front of the Hassler Hotel next door and the doorman would just signal for one and we'd be off - no waiting! We enjoyed the breakfast buffet (full, not Continental!) but did not have dinner at the hotel but we understood from other guests it was great. We'd definitely stay here again because it offers such a central location with nice views over the city and all the staff including the doormen were absolutely fantastic!!

Before my arrival I arranged for transportation from the airport, which was very efficient and relatively inexpensive (for Rome anyway). I had also requested to have one of the hotel's deluxe rooms with a balcony, but received an email back from the hotel stating that it would be an additional 80 euro per night for that type of room. Strange I thought, since the Ambassordor Club guarantees an upgraded room, and I was simply asking for the room category that I had made my a reservation for. After sending another email to the hotel (and referencing my Ambassador Club #), at check in I was given a shoebox size standard room, however with a balcony that was about 3 times the size of the room. Fine I thought, until it started pouring rain, and I was stuck in the shoebox with no balcony to escape to. I asked the manager to be moved to a deluxe room and instead was patronizingly given a superior room with a communal balcony (the exact room shows up on the hotel's website entitled \"superior room w/balcony\"). I resented having to ask for what I had reserved and paid for, and got tired of calling management, so I promptly checked out the next morning. At check out I was amazed to see that the credit card deposit that I had prepaid had not been deducted from the bill, nor had the free night certificate that I had redeemed at check in. This resulted in an additional charge of 440 euro, that I had to argue with the reception clerk to get deducted. The man was completely rude and made me feel petty for noticing the charges! A 5 star hotel? I don't think so! Furthermore, all of the nice little perks that were promised by the Ambassador Club, never happened here. (Daily gifts? Personalized service? Upgrade? Not!) All in all, this hotel was just too much work. I had to ask for everything. I just wanted to relax, be pampered and enjoy Rome.

We ate at at least 10 difference restaurants and I can't remeber any names, they were all good. We also used Sean and Ross at Angels Tours for three different tours. They were great and the kids really enjoyed them. We took thee of their tours, Sena was particularly good at the Vatican. If you are into really specific detail on the history of Rome you can probably find a more in depth tour. Because they go in small groups (10 or fewer) it is great with the kids. We saw a number of groups with 20-30 people, they looked miserable. If you want a workout facility, the IC is pretty poor, just a bike and treadmill.", "Date": "August 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cIntercontinental Rome\u201d", "Author": "MEMORYBUYER", "ReviewID": "UR3696469", "Content": "Nice hotel, great location.

We expected the king and would have booked elsewhere if we'd have known they didnt have it, but thank goodness for the suite upgrade. Great hotel location at the top of the Spanish Steps.

We were on the 6 floor and just passed the elevators was an outdoor roof area with tables and chairs and a panorama view of the city. The staff and concierge were friendly and helpful. We are IC members and turned in points for one free night, which really helped against the euro. A wonderful buffet breakfast was also included with our membership.

We were given a standard room on the first floor - the hotel is very clean, but the room and bathroom were extremely small (although it had high ceilings). I agree with the poster who said housekeeping was lacking - the beds were barely made up, there was no turn-down service, and they didn't do the basic straightening up that you would expect in even a 3-star hotel. The room had very basic amenities - more like a 3 or 4 star than 5 star. However, the location is phenomenal - very central and swank neighborhood. We walked everywhere and loved having a central base to relax in during the afternoons. This room was fine given the Priceline bid we paid, but if you're paying the normal rate, I'm sure there are dozens of other truly 5-star hotels that would be better. We stayed at the Starhotel Metropole near the train station during our last night (easier access to the airport), and were blown away how much more plush the room was there compared to the Intercontinental. So if you want to stay literally on top of the Spanish Steps, book away - but if you're willing to deal with a less fashionable neighborhood, there are much better options.", "Date": "June 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cAn Outstanding Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Bob710", "ReviewID": "UR3517478", "Content": "This was our first time in Rome.

We were a little concerned about arriving after midnight , but Pino, the concierege, arranged transportation and everything went like clockwork. We looked forward to breakfast in the mornings and our room was fresh and clean. Being located at the top of the Spanish Steps is a great plus, as you get some fresh air and escape a little of the smog/fumes that accumulate in the lower streets. We considered staying closer to the Piazza Navona, but to be honest, we are glad that we didn't - again fumes. I note this because my husband and I are great allergy sufferers and found that we were very comfortable where we stayed. The area of the Spanish Steps is definite walking distance to all locations as we walked to most of the central areas of Rome and to Vatican City (about 20 min). Our only complaint was being initially placed in a room on a smoking floor when we had specifically asked for a non-smoking room and confirmed that. Also, we were booked into a deluxe room and the first room was not. We merely rang the front desk and they showed us 2 other rooms (this is at 1AM), one of which was exactly what we had booked. Once I showed the reservation details of the room specs from the internet, we had no problem. We were also given a 4 PM checkout. We would definitely stay here again.
