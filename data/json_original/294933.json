One one hand, I trust trip advisor immensely and have used the site for years. However, no-one else seems to have had the SHOCKING stay that I had. I stayed at this hotel based on the positive reviews, and really regret that now, unfortunately. Look. It was amazing being so close to the Blue Mosque. Incredible. However, in 7 days, I visited the Mosque twice. You could spend a day at the mosque and never want to visit it again, so staying at Alzer for that reason, in my opinion, isn't the best one. Ok, I hate to talk badly about the hotel, because there are SOOO many positive reviews, so I'll make it brief. I back up everything i've said 100%. -ves I asked to move rooms twice, and both times they never got back to me. I stayed in room 33 (double room, facing street) Paper thin walls. Paper thin walls in bathroom..with ZERO extraction. The 'restaurant' (5th floor) food was terrible. I mean, it was SO poor. The same food was brought out 4 days in a row, before another poor attempt at breakfast meal was realised, the coffee is pathetic. A lavazza espresso cost \u00c2\u00a32.50. handrails and taps fell off (and were later fixed) there is a lot of construction work going on outside the hotel, and it seems the love to work twilight hours. +ves Air conditioning worked, tv worked, very clean, wifi worked, fridge worked, view is stunning,, staff are lovely but do like a good stare, the view of the blue mosque from the 5th floor makes a sweet facebook profile picture. This is what i told friends and family, and hopefully, this will help one of you: Don't stay here. If you're staying SOLELY in istanbul, for anything longer than 4 days, find a hotel nearer the bazaar or the egyptian spice market or right on the water. Staying at a hotel in Istanbul for its proximity to a monument is a misnomer- the city is VERY small and public transport is VERY good. Also, DO NOT GO TO HODGJA PASHA.

The entire frontage of the hotel was excavated to a depth of about 4ft, with construction machinery and materials obstructing access to the hotel. This is not a short term project, I would estimate that to complete the re-paving project will take a matter of months not weeks. My wife found ingress and exit to the hotel very difficult, stumbling over excavated paving,heavy machinery, and building materials ( photos available). At no point prior to our arrival did the hotel advise us of any anticipated dificulties.

This is the real Istanbul, 2 mins from Hagia Sophia, 10 mins walk from the Grand Bazaar and at the end of one of the main street with literally hundreds of restaurants so if you want to experience the city then this is an ideal place to stay. It only has 20 odd rooms so is small and very friendly with excellent staff. Buffet breakfast is served in the rooftop restaurant with stunning views (see pic). We stayed here following a recommendation from a friend and it lived up to her comments. We were also lucky to be in Istanbul for the start of Ramadan so it is a great experience to mix with the locals as the square outside come alive at dusk with picnics and food sellers for the end of the days fasting.

The view from the breakfast room on the roof of the hotel is stunning, and the cafe/restaurant at the front of the hotel looking out on the Hippodrome is a very relaxing place for a drink or a meal. I would recommend paying extra for a Hippodrome Room. The room was quite spacious and beautifully decorated. I had a lot of luggage with me, as I was spending 5 days here before embarking on a three week cruise, so storage space was a bit of an issue for me, but would be fine if you were just there for, say, up to a week. Other people have mentioned the call to the prayer in the early hours of the morning which, of course, is quite loud given the proximity to the Blue Mosque. By the third night I actually slept though it! The biggest plus point of this hotel is its staff, especially for the solo traveller. The atmosphere is very welcoming and friendly, and you really feel that you are coming home when you return at the end of a hot day of sightseeing. The star has to be the wonderful Gokhan (Front Office Manager), who speaks excellent English and sorts anything and everything that you need. On the day I was leaving to embark the cruise ship, I was a little worried about just getting an ordinary taxi as I had never been to the Istanbul Harbour before, didn't know how many ships would be in, and how far I might have to carry my luggage etc. Anyway, after some discussion with his colleagues, Gokhan arranged that the man who met me at the airport would take me to the harbour, and I was also accompanied by Mevlut (one of the chefs who was off duty) in case I needed someone to carry my bags!

Mehmet was still there and as courteous as ever, shouting us a beer and a wine the minute we arrived and making us feel right at home. What a man with a great memory. The breakfast was great & plenty of it and the lady in charge (we lost her name) was most helpful & friendly.

We observed him going to exceptional lenghts to aid an elderly USA couple whose luggage had been lost by an airline. After numerous phone calls he located it, then ran the couple to the airport to recover their cases & then sped back to the port in his car and got them on their Cruise ship minutes before it sailed. Brilliant work and all the staff display this type of attitude. They are a really pleasant team working at a hotel in the very best of locations in Sultanamet, the historical part of Istanbul. It is only minutes to all the wonderful sights such as the Blue Mosque, Haghia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, Yerebatan Sarayi (underground cisterns) Archaeological Museum, Grand Bazaar etc. and the Bosphorus.

Its a really nice, small hotel with a fantastic location - on At Meydani, the former Hippodrome, just across from the Blue Mosque. On the first night we were given room 32 - which was really small and cramped - and we were not too happy. The next morning we requested a room change and they moved us to room 34 - the `Standart Room' on their website - which was quite nice and comfortable. It was a lot larger and brighter than the earlier room - though the view from the room was unremarkable. What is fantastic is the view from the breakfast room. You have a spectacular view of the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia on one side and the sea of Marmara on the other. What really made the stay memorable though were the people. Engin, the person who runs the restaurant/bar in the evenings is a really wonderful man. We quite enjoyed chatting with him in the nights after returning from an evening of sight seeing. On learning that we did not have a guide book he lent us an excellent guidebook which had been left to him by a previous guest. He also had several recommendations of places to eat and shop - and it was clear these were genuine recommendations and he was not working on commision. The breakfast was extremely good and one of the things I really miss. The cook, Mevlut, makes an excellent form of scrambled eggs. There were all kinds of things to suite every palate - from meat things to fresh crispy cereal to healthy fruits. The receptionist, Gokhan, was also a very friendly guy and was responsible for moving us to the nicer room which completely changed our perspective of the place.
