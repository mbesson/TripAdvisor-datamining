We needed a place for an economical overnight stay in the heart of Sultanahmet in order to maximize our limited time. We reserved the separate \"3 Bedroom\" apartment, which is three blocks (4 minute walk) away, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I say \"3 BR\" because one of the beds is actually in a recessed corner of the main living room. It is next to the streetfront window and the streetlight inevitably shines through the rather flimsy shade. That being said, an eye visor minimized the effects of the light pollution and there was actually very little noise other than the early morning call to prayer. In fact, we loved the \"lived in\" (barbershop, feral cats and all!) ambience of the little side street which felt away from the tourist crowds but close enough to easily walk to the Aya Sofia or Blue Mosque within 5-10 minutes. Overall, the apartment worked great for our party of 5, with two of us sharing the large bed in the living room, two others in twins in one bedroom and one other in the queen in the second bedroom. The apartment was clean and neat. The wireless worked in the evening, but did not work in the morning for some reason. The hotel itself was very neat and offered a delicious breakfast in the dining room. Due to weather considerations, they have not started serving on the rooftop terrace yet, but we did escape up there with some coffee for some terrific ocean (and Blue Mosque) views before we had to leave. The staff spoke decent English and were very helpful in arranging a great local color restaurant reservation and driver in the Punkapi (fish market) district. They also kept an eye on our luggage for us at the main hotel reception and loaned me an adaptor for the power cord on my laptop. Overall, we were very pleased with our stay at the Angel's Home. If you've got a party of 4-6, and like to step outside the box a little, the apartment is a particularly attractive deal.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "firenze", "Title": "\u201cA group of biker friends stayed\u201d", "Author": "pia z", "ReviewID": "UR128263936", "Content": "We were a gropup of bikers stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in april.

Be sure, thou, if you deal with Euro or Lira, and when they help and get information, ask to get it written down. Staf in reception are pretty fluent in English. Clean and pretty, daily service, coffe, tea, cattle and water in every room.

Personally I find the Turkisch breakfast very sweet - but every day complemented with more european eggs, salami, fried vegetables.

It was our first time in Istanbul, and location was important to us so we chose this hotel as it had reasonable prices and was within walking distance to Aya Sophia, the Blue Mosque and the Grand Bazaar. From that perspective, the hotel was perfect as all these attractions are only a 5 minute walk uphill. The hotel itself is on a small quiet street in a neighborhood filled with smaller hotels. There is no lobby or main room when you first enter - instead you walk through a restaurant and are checked in by a main over a cash register. Be careful about how many suitcases you bring! There is no elevator, and all the rooms are located high up a windy staircase. The rates were reasonable, however we definitely expected clean and presentable rooms (according to the website). Unfortunately this was not the case! Our room was furnished with comforter etc. from the 1970s, that may not have been washed since then. Several appliances in the hotel (including the showerhead) fell apart when you touched them. Besides the considerable dust and general feeling of non-cleanliness, the ceiling was low and you had to stoop to stand in certain parts of the room. The room did feature a balcony, but it was right next to a huge exhaust fan and was also dirty so we could not make use of it. Other amenities in the room include a flatscreen TV with general news channels and bottled water with broken seals.There is no breakfast available. We did not try the restaurant as we were not impressed with the hotel. I would not recommend this hotel, as just by walking around we saw many other establishments at a higher quality level at the same price level.

Hotel Room Meant to be a twin room, it was a little cramped. There was an old, small TV in the corner, and the bathroom was slightly cramped too. Anyone \"large\" or very tall would struggle to have moving space in the shower cubicle. There was also some mould on the ceiling, but this didn't affect our stay at all. There wasn't much \"leg room\" on the toilet seat as it was very close to the wall. Bed Comfortable and no problems. Staff Friendly, spoke reasonable English at best, always cheerful and helpful. Internet/Wifi There is wifi coverage throughout the hotel, there is also a PC on the first floor - all free to use. Housekeeping Daily service, well kept. The water in the room is not free, they charged us 2TL per bottle. We assumed it was free. Breakfast This was a negative. It was included but wasn't very good at all. They only had small pieces of bread (no turkish bread/toast), their 2 cold drinks were disgusting (meant to be orange and something else) and they only did one type of egg. There was no English tea available. However, there was a nice greenhouse-type area to eat which was pleasant. Airport transfer They collected us on time, and it was a good pickup service. Other The roof terrace was being renovated sadly, so we didn't get to see it. During the day, it can get noisy if you have a front facing room - luckily we were out most days and by night time things had quietened down.

The staff at the hotel are very friendly and helpful. They were probably the best part of our experience at Angel's Home.

We had to walk to the other Angel's Home for breakfast and it was alright. It wasn't too fancy, but it had enough selection for us to be satisfied. Just beware that the freshly squeezed juices are not included in the price, which we found out after the fact. However, the staff here were very pleasant so it wasn't so bad.

I have been staying to many 5 star hotels and famous ones, but every time we went there we had some complains about rooms, stuffs, food, rude behavior,\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so when we decided to come to Istanbul I told to my husband we will not reserve a room until I see the hotel's room with my own eyes. My cousin had been to Turkey and he had stayed in Angle's home Hotel. So he made me certain that Angel's home hotel is the ideal place for me, but I preferred see the hotel with my own eyes. We made that big risk and just took the plane to Istanbul. Our plan was to see first Angle and then search other hotels one by one. I had been searching hotels for one month in internet and I had the hotel addresses and I had been reading many reviews about them. So we reached the hotel, our first encounter was with Hakan, hotel owner and chief Sakir. Talking with Sakir was as if I have seen my brother who is so kind and wants to make everything all right for us. Angel's home hotel has 2 buildings in the same street. So Sakir and we went upstairs and downstairs to each building and I saw some rooms. As I told you before I am very sensitive about everything, I couldn't make choice so I asked Sakir again and again we went upstairs and downstairs. I checked everything, beds, bathrooms, and the cleanliness of the room. Everything seemed all right for me, so we decided to stay at Angle for 8 nights. In my heart I was worry a little because although I checked everything but I was not completely sure about it, but when we stayed one night I understood it was the hotel I wanted to stay on Istanbul and I was lucky that my first choice was the best. We stayed 3 nights at penthouse. Wow! What a view of the sea! We stayed 5 nights at deluxe room. It was so nice, clean, hot water (in winter); everything in the room was comfortable. Every day when we came back in the evening, we were happy to return to a very romantic and nice room. Nice hotel, nice room, beautiful lobby, very warm and friendly stuffs made our journey magical. Next time, if I want to go to Istanbul, defiantly I will choose Angel's home hotel again. They treat their gusts as a member of their family. They put a lot of respect to the guest needs and problems. At the end I want to thank Hakan, his brother Okan, chief Sakir, chief Tekin and other stuffs whom were very so nice and friendly but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know their names. If you stay at Angle hotel you are very near to all the important historical monuments, blue mosque, ayasofya, grand bazaar, and there is tramway station near. You can go to many places. My advice to you is: if you want your journey to be economical don't go to travel agencies. The tour they suggest is very expensive. You can go by yourself and explore the city. It is so much cheaper. Near Angel's hotel, in front of Blue mosque is Sultanahmet Street. From Sultanahmet you can go by tramway to Eninonu (the port). There are many ships there. They took you for six hours tour to black sea; the price is just 20 TL for each. They took you to a very nice village. On the top of the village is a ruined castle. What a view from there! If you went there I recommend you to eat fish, so yummy!!! From sultanahmet you can go by tramway to Aksaray. In Aksaray go to Metro, it goes till the Ataturk airport. The price of tramway and metro for each person is one and half TL. We have seen two nice malls in Istanbul (cevahir mall and forum Istanbul) you can go there just by tramway or metro or bus. The transportation in Istanbul is very easy and economic. If everybody has any questions I am willing to answer them.

The owner had recommended a booked tour & made it clear that the management did not take a cut - the staff member who booked it however probably DID take a cut & we ended up paying 50% more than advised. He apologised & said it was his error but we still had to pay the extra cost. In rushing out on the tour we didnt notice that we had (foolishly for sure) left the safe key on a bedside table covered by a magazine & it was still covered when we got back. I had counted, written in my diary and bundled up the unrequired currency when we arrived & diidnt check it until the night before we were moving on. Cunningly the thief had removed money from each (type) currency bundle in the hope we wouldnt notice any was missing. I alerted the co-owner (younger brother) and initially he was helpful but later refused any responsibility and advised we couldnt prove anything & we should either basically `shut up' or go the police.

First the positives. Staff were very friendly and happy to help, booking airport transfers and generally cheerful, and the hotel location is great for seeing Sultanahmet, although there are many many other hotels in the same area. There is a computer for free internet access in the lobby, although again this is a pretty common feature. Now on to the negatives. The room we had was large, but with strange decoration (it seems to be a 'love' theme, think of heart shaped cusions, canopy over the bed, red \"satin\" sheets, complimentary condom in bathroom (I'm not joking) - we didn't specifically ask for such a room). Air con was provided, but was old and had a musty smell about it when on, so we left it off. There were signs in the room stating that all outside food and drink was banned - and housekeeping would confiscate it from our rooms if found! Instead we were told to use the minibar (expensive) or room service (no prices advertised) We have stayed in many hotels worldwide but I have never seen such a policy anywhere. We took to sneaking water bottles past reception and hiding snacks in our luggage to avoid them getting taken. The bathroom was in need of redocoration, with paint peeling from the ceiling above the shower. Paint tended to fall on you whilst showering if you weren't careful. The shower itself initially didn't work but to their credit this was quickly fixed by hotel staff. The hotel is split over two sites a couple of minutes walk from each other. We had to walk to the other site for breakfast every morning. There was a lot of choice for breakfast, but unfortunately most of it was unappitising, consisting of plates of stone cold fried eggs, omlettes, potato wedges and crepes. One day we arrived at breakfast at 7:30am (the time breakfast starts) hoping for some hot crepes but no, they were still stone cold. We wondered when exactly they had been cooked. On the plus side the cakes are very good, there is hot scrambled eggs and french toast, and fresh watermelon is availiable. The coffee wasn't great, but there is a large selection of herbal teas. Unsurprisingly, we didn't try the dinner. We chose the hotel because of it's good TripAdvisor rating, and obviously a lot of people like it, but it wasn't really for us. We have stayed in other nearby hotels in Istanbul and found them to be significantly better for the price (e.g. Hotel Surmungen on the same street). Would give Angle's Home a rating 1.5 if it was possible.", "Date": "September 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cUnbeatable location, amazing friendly and helpful staff- i doubt you'll get better value for money.\u201d", "Author": "JoMaginty", "ReviewID": "UR39261786", "Content": "Excellent location on gorgeous quiet street but still right next to all of the atmosphere of 'old' istanbul.

My recomendation would be to stay here and to go to the blue hotel at the top of the hill (expensive) and have dinner at their roof top resturant which has the best views over the old city.. we went up lotsof roofs on our trip.

The room smelled heavily of floral perfume and was decorated in a bizarre dated / motel fashion. The balcony was smaller than had been advertised as was the room having very low ceilings. The bathroom was dingy and the whole room was particularly depressing. We went to Angel's Home's second site to check the alternative rooms and found them equally uninspiring for the price. We told the staff that we did not want to stay in the hotel and asked what we could do about a refund. We were told that as we had booked over the internet and paid up front, both of which were requirements of booking, we had no rights and therefore had to forfeit all our money, which was four nights totalling 438,6 Euro. We stated that we were happy to discuss a compromise recognising that we would probably lose the first nights money however the management expressed quite a hostile attitude telling us that becuase he deals over the internet he would not be able to resell the room. He told us that there was no way that we would be able to get any money back, despite an ongoing email dialogue with him. Having discussed the matter with the local tourism bureau we were advised that there are many complaints from people who booked over the internet only to find their accommodation poor and customer service to match. We wanted to post this to make sure that people did not make the same mistake that we did.

My mind was somewhat laid at ease once I started corresponding with the hotel regarding their transfer service. Their prompt replies paved the path to the good service we received in the hotel.

Away from the hubbub of Sultanahmet, the part of the hotel we stayed in is situated at the end of neon-lit yet quiet road, around the corner of good restaurants (Sofa Restaurant), quaint shops and wonderful rooftop terraces, including the hotel's own, where one can admire one of the most impressive views of the Blue Mosque (especially at night) on one side and the Bosphorous on the other. Despite it's relatively remote and quiet location compared to other hotels and hostels in the vicinity, most sights are well within walking distance (Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, Hippodrome, Basilica Cistern) and those that aren't are easily accessed via the Sultanahmet tram station, which again is no more than a 10 minute walk from the hotel.

All I can say is that I'm so glad I booked this hotel for our recent trip to Istanbul. My mum and I spent 5 nights at the Angel's Home Hotel for our first visit to this fantastic city. We chose to stay in Sultanahmet as we were mostly interested in the history and sights of the old town rather than the modern busy city of new Istanbul. And we couldn't have made a better choice. Firstly, having travelled all over the world and being a massive fan of tripadvisor - I'm surprised that this hotel isn't further up the ranks. When we booked we were torn between two choices, the Angles Home Hotel and one of the others which was rated in the top 5. We chose Angles Home hotel (ranked at 38) as it was cheaper, seemed to have more genuine reviews and the hotel website was more inviting. Having seen the other hotel we are so glad we chose the Angles Home as whilst it seemed nice too, the Angels home is so much more personal and the service and staff were absolutely unbeatable. I honestly can't think of a hotel were I have felt more welcome, and looked after. We chose the penthouse room as it had a large balcony with sea views (highly recommended) and expedia had a great deal on which made it cheaper than the deluxe rooms (no balcony). The views were fantastic and the rooms were very charming with lots of little extras like robes, slippers and toiletries - not what you'd expect from a 3* hotel/B&B. If you like ultra modern and minimalist - this hotel isn't for you, but then you'd be better off in one of the skyscrapers in modern Istanbul if that's the case. The Angles Home is extremely well thought out, traditional in terms of decor and only down side is that as it's an original old building they can't have lifts - so the penthouse was a few floors up a beautiful winding staircase. But if you can handle a bit of exercise - it's definitely worth it for the views and huge balcony. We had room 302-E, and from what I saw of the others this was by far the best. The breakfast is also fantastic. Huge variety of Turkish and continental breakfast, with some hot food too. This was served from the roof top of the sister hotel (also the Angels home) around the corner. And as for location, I don't believe you can get better. It is literally 100 metres from the blue mosque, surrounded by street cafes and restaurants but just out of the hustle and bustle enough so that it was really peaceful.

Highly recommended for a young couple that wants to tour Sultanahment. We booked the Penthouse room (sea view) in the main hotel (there is also a second hotel around the corner) via the hotel's website. The staff replied quickly to my reservation request and all went smoothly. The hotel's shuttle driver was prompt and professional. Check-in was fine. The location is perfect for seeing the Sultanahmet sights. You are literally a 3-minute walk from the park separating Hagia Sophia and Sultanahmet mosque. Just a bit beyond that is the tram to get to Eminonu or Beyoglu. Keep in mind that the area gets pretty quiet at night -- there are very few bars and clubs nearby. If you interested in that scene, consider staying near Taksim and tramming it to Sultanahmet during the day. We were happy here. The room had an outstanding view of south Sultanahmet, the Bosporus, and the Asian side. Because the windows are so large, you can literally enjoy the view while laying in bed. The good-sized balcony was our favorite part of the room -- we ended each day sitting at the table sipping tea. Unfortunately if you end up with guests in the adjacent room, the only thing separating the two balcony is a gate. We didn't have to worry about this, though -- it was romantic and private. Very nice bathroom by Turkish standards: decent size, new fixtures, mid-sized shower/tub. Great towels/robes/slippers. The decor of the room (and the hotel overall) wasn't our style -- lots of gaudy reds and golds with angels and hearts everywhere -- but we honestly didn't care too much. Would have preferred some indirect lighting (i.e. shaded lamps) in the room rather than the exposed-bulb wall lamps. Not a big negative. The penthouse rate includes dinner (minus drinks) each everning, which we enjoyed twice. Above average food and service. Sultanahmet is known for mediocre & expensive restaurants, so this was a nice option when we didn't have the time/energy to venture across the Galata bridge. The free breakfasts were even better -- a huge spread of great traditional turkish fare in the garden room. Absolutely perfect way to start the days. The other Angel's Home building has a roof-top terrace with an outstanding view of the Sultanahment mosque. We had tea there one evening and had it all to ourselves -- very nice. Apparently they also have a breakfast there, so I recommend asking about it. Overall the service was excellent. Everyone was extremely friendly and professional. Spent quite a while talking with Ufuk and Kubi -- iyi gunler, guys! We had a few minor issues that the staff handled professionally and quickly. One minor complaint -- there is no iron in the room, and you may only use the hotel's while in the lobby. I understand the fire hazard, which the owner explained corteously, but I still would have preferred to take it back to the room. I had never seen this in any other hotel.

We booked with an internet booking agency for our first stay, and emailed the hotel directly for the second stay. The reason for the latter was because only standard rooms can be booked with an agency and we wanted a higher standard room (mid-range) for our second (longer) stay. Angel's Home comprises two buildings a few minutes walk apart. One has the terrace restaurant where buffet breakfast for both buildings is served. The view from the terrace is great - blue mosque one side, Marmara Sea the other. The range and quality of breakfast food was very good. Our standard room was in this building. The room itself was compact, with little space for placing baggage. Nevertheless it was clean and overall we thought good value. We did have a bit of trouble trying to get the strange hot water system for the shower to work but as it was about 40 degrees outside it wasn't much of an issue (might be different in winter though!). The room for our second stay was in the second building. We had paid 15 euros per night extra for this room and expected something a little better (bigger) than our first room. If anything, it was more compact than the standard room and the design of the room was such that the only floorspace available for baggage was at the foot of the bed, making moving around the room very difficult. The only sitting room was the bed. The room was perhaps slightly better furnished than the standard room and had a normal shower hot water system, but we struggled to find any justification for the price difference. Otherwise, the hotel is very clean and very well located right in the heart of Sultanamet. The rooms have tea and coffee making facilities - a rarity in Turkey, we found. Our rooms were serviced daily. The staff are pleasant and the restaurant meals very good, if perhaps a little overpriced compared with other options in the area. We had one unfortunate incident at the end of our stay. Just before we retired on our last night I asked my wife for a 50 euro note to ensure I had enough cash to pay the hotel bill next morning (although I intended to use my lira if I had enough). This note is very similar in colour and size to the Turkish 50 lira note. My wife and I, coming from Australia, had not dealt with either currency before and had decided to use lira throughout our trip, keeping our supply of euros quite separate and to use for currency exchange. Next morning I counted out cash for the bill and found I had just enough lira to pay for it. On the tram to our next location my wife asked if I had used the 50 euros. I had completely forgotten she had given it to me and now realised why I had had enough lira to pay the bill - one of the notes I had handed over thinking it was 50 lira was in fact 50 euros. I am surprised that the cashier didn't notice the difference.

We didn't mention it to the hosts but they must have noticed it because we could tell they had sprayed the room toward the end of our stay. Our kids loved playing with the hotel cats.

We arrived to Sabiha Gokcen Airport and took a 1hr taxi ride to the hotel which cost \u00c2\u00a330. Alternatively, take the bus to Kadikoy for \u00c2\u00a32 then a ferry to Istanbul Eminou (50p) then a taxi to the hotel because it might be hard to find at first but very easy once you have seen it. (\u00c2\u00a32 taxi). Staff: We arrived to the very hospitable staff of the hotel were we checked in within a few minutes. We had booked 2 rooms, one for me and my wife and one for my mother in law. They placed me and my wife on the 3rd floor and my mother in law on the ground floor. We asked if anything could be done to have both rooms on the same floor and i felt they really went out of their way to help us. They rearranged rooms for other customers who were about to visit and placed us on the same floor. I had heard so much about their service from tripadvisor beforehand and can now advertise about it myself. Room: The rooms were almost identical, with a double bed, a tv, a safe, a minibar and shower in each room. The bed was very comfortable and had no trouble sleeping as if it were my own. The tv had over 30 channels of which about 5 are English. I was able to watch all premiership matches on tv aswell as champions league matches. The safe was well sized for your passports and valuables. The minibar had drinks which were not overly priced. On the last night, my wife got thirsty so she had a bottle of water from the minibar. When we checked out they said it was on them and did not charge us for it. The toilet had amneties that you would usually see in a 4 star hotel. These included a shaving kit, toothbrush and toothpaste, bathrobes, slippers, a powerful hairdryar, shampoo and a sewing kit. Breakfast: Breakfast was served in the Angel's home 2 which is about a 30 second walk from the hotel. The breakfast variety included scrambled egg, boiled eggs, cold meats, olives, cereals, jams, teas, sausages, spring rolls.... etc..... basically....more than enough. Location: 5 mins walk to blue mosque, Topkaki palace, Aya Sofia and the closest tram station. Excellent location in a lovely quiet area, although a few minutes walk to the hustle and bustle of Istanbul. 10mins walk from the Grand Bazaar and a 15min taxi ride to Taksim Square ( \u00c2\u00a33 taxi ride). Advise: make sure the taxi meter says Gunduz between 6am and midnight. If it does not say gunduz then they have it on the night rate and you will pay 1.5x the fare. Services: There was internet in the lobby and wireless throughout the hotel as well as a very well equipped gym. There was a beautiful seating area in the roof were you are served complimentary tea or coffee. The weather was too cold for us while we were there to enjoy it. The hotel staff arranged our taxi back to the airport at a very reasonable price in a people carrier. (I will not disclose the price, but it was very similar to the yellow taxi's and much more comfortable, so i would advise to use the hotel to arrange your transportation). On our way to the airport, our driver received a call from the hotel saying i had forgotten to return the room keys. I left the keys with the driver who returned the keys to the hotel. This was an added benefit of using their taxi driver(who was a lovely person). Finally to the hotel staff. Thanks a lot for a really wonderful experience. I will definately not hesitate to visit you again. It was my mother in law's first trip abroad in many years and you truly made it a memorable one by your service and by placing us on the same floor. Sorry for leaving to the airport with the rooms keys. I was too sad to be leaving that i wanted an excuse to come back. The taxi driver you sent us to the airport with was brilliant.

We are both 32 years old. When we arrived we were met at the airport by a friendly man holding a sign with my name and our free ride to the hotel. Our flight arrived an hour early so we were surpised that our ride was there - guess they checked our flight status online, whcih impressed me. Along the way he pointed out some sites for us and I precticed my few words in Turkish. When we arrived at the hotel Angel's home, we were told that we should go over the Angel's home 2. They brought our luggage over for us. I had originally booked a standard double room at Angel's home for 49 a night but they upgraded us to double room at Angel's home 2 -- a room with a view and what I believe wass much larger than the room I originally booked. When we checked out it was 59 a night. The only complaint I had was that this upgraded room had the typical European tub with the hand-held shower, and I had booked at the original Angel's home for the standing stall shower - however, that being said, it was not a big deal because this tub had shower doors (unlike many that I have used before in Europe) so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as awkward as I had thought and the view with hearing the prayer call more than made up for it - so we decided to stay in that room. And I am sure that if I had asked to be moved back to a room with a shower stall they would have provided it to me without question. The staff at the hotel are very friendly and always willing to answer any questions, suggest places to go and call cabs for us and let us in at 3am when we came back from clubs and still wake us up at 8am!! The breakfast was plentiful and had a wide variety of buffet items and because the weather was so nice we ate on the roof of Angel's home which was beautiful!! I loved the juice and the eggs with the sausages!!! Could not get enough!! Our room was big and very confortable and was always spotlessly cleaned. Our room was the gold colored fabric room with curtains to block the light, a safe and mini bar and a very comfy bed. The beds were 2 single beds, but we just pushed them together and were fine. I think the housekeeper noticed that I needed extra hangers for my clothes and the next day I had 5 more in the closet. The internet access was a huge perk. Cute little additions, like slippers, robes and travel kits with toothpaste etc. I even noticed that there were binoculars on a table on the roof of Angel's home for us to use - to me, little touches like that make a hotel unique and welcoming. The location of this hotel could not be better - perfect for exploring all the major sites and easy to get to the \"Kennedy highway\" to get to other destinations by Taksi (taxi). The cats at the hotel are friendly and cute and added a \"home\" touch. The ONLY complaint is that the bathrooms would sometimes smell like sulfur, however I am sure that this is NOT unique to this hotel and is just the water system in the city similar to places like in Italy. I would just spray perfume once in a while and the problem was solved or just shut the bathroom door. I really enjoyed my stay there and would highly recommend the hotel and will stay again when I return - and I will!!! Anyone looking for a great deal will find it here. You get a lot for your money and it deserves its high rating on Tripadvisor even though it is not in the same category as let's say The Four Seasons. I have read some negative posts re: this hotel on tripadvisor which seem to be based on the fact that this hotel has such a high rating so people assume they are a five star hotel. It's not. But when you compare what you get with what you paid - it's an amazing deal and tries just as hard to be a 5 star. This was def. the best overall deal I have ever gotten in Europe. I highly recommed it to people looking for a great deal, who want an amazing location, a friendly staff and comfortable rooms. I absolutely LOVED this city. I will post a review in the forum soon.

You can also pick up the Istanbul tram just a few blocks from the hotel. The rooms are clean, modern, and equipped with pretty much everything you could ask for. Everything worked, and the room was in good shape and was well cleaned everyday. The breakfast is good and is served on an outdoor rooftop balcony with some great views. The staff is very helpful. Hakan helped us with tours, sightseeing questions, and arranged a very early ride to the airport for us - 3:15 a.m.! The other staff were friendly and helpful, too. There are several kitty cats hanging out at the hotel, so if you like cats, it will be an added bonus, but there are not so prevalent that they would bother someone who is not particular to cats, either. Another note - we had a great time in Istanbul. People were friendly and helpful and we were never hassled once for being Americans. Do be careful of the carpet salesman. It bothered us the first day, but then we learned how to avoid them and we had no problem after that. The sellers in the grand bazaar and spice market were not particularly bothersome, so I recommend you visit these sights even if you have some trepidation about it. Of course, the Aya Sofia and the Blue Mosque are breathtaking and you must visit them. The day tour offered at a discount thru the hotel is also a good deal. You get to go to the Asian side, which was the first time we had ever been to that continent! Finally, a slightly less visited spot is the Chora Church, which will require a taxi ride. It is a Byzantine era orthodox church filled with jaw-dropping frescos and mosaics. The old city walls are not far from there, so you can see those on the same trip.

The staff is small but very friendly, gracious, helpful - each speaking English and knowledgeable about the city.

Breakfast is served on the rooftop terrace, where they offer a large healthy buffet you can enjoy in sun or shade. It's an older building and my room only perfunctory, but the bathroom was recently remodeled with white tile and new plumbing fixtures. (Room safe is insufficient.) With such close proximity to the Blue Mosque come the fairly loud nightly calls to prayer, though this is nearly unavoidable in Sultanahmet.

First of all, I cannot say enough about the owners and their families, or the staff. Our rooms were very clean, the automatic lights worked perfectly and all I had to do was mention a need and I got it. Hakan and Okan are the perfect owners in terms of personality. The showers were very nice, plenty hot with lots of pressure, the rooms were very comfortable and the balcony, although not impressive in view, had a nice breeze all the time. As an American waking up to 5 Azzans calling for prayers at 5:45 the first day was a shock, after that I used them to be my alarm clock and even found comfort in them at times. The staff was so helpful in everything, they even went walking with me to go food shopping....Why food shopping??? They actually let me take over the kitchen!! Hakan and his wife were kind enough to join us for dinner on the beautiful terrace that had breathtaking views of the bosphorus. Then there are the cats...Angel.....and Angel. The cats were very well behaved, loved to cuddle if you wanted to, and left when you didn't. The gym was small and just enough to keep one maintained, the stairs were never an issue with us. But again, the service was phenominal, we would get great suggestions, then when we decided they would call a cab for us, tell them where we were going and warn the driver about trying to be crafty. Now for my embarrassment.....we stayed for 2 weeks, at the end of the stay they made me cry...(I am a 49 year old man) the staff purposely dropped my bags at the other end of the lobby, asked me to check them, when I stood up, I turned to find the family, and the staff from both shifts had lined up come to say goodbye. As we were heading towards the 55 Chevy to take me to the airport they threw glasses of water in the street behind me, when i asked why, hakan told me it was a turkish custom meaning you came as smooth as water and we want you back the same way. Upon leaving I got a manly hug from Hakan and this...\"We get some guests that stay with us and we never see again, we get some that come back and we remember them, you we will never forget\" Thats it!!

Angel's Home is not a large, corporate hotel chain, where one hotel is indistinguishable from all the others. One Marriott is virtually identical to all Marriotts. One Hyatt is exactly like all other Hyatts (and like most Marriotts.) For travelers who like that sort of thing, Istanbul certainly has plenty of them and they are doubtess fine -- uniformly, predictably, antiseptically fine and when you wake up in the morning, you'll have no clue as to whether you are in Istanbul or Cleveland. But our experience at Angel's Home was truly special. Yes, indeed, the dining room is on the rooftop terrace of the three-story building (not six as an unhappy colleague seems to have believed). And from there the views are simply stunning -- the justly famous Blue Mosque in one direction, the Marmara Sea and the Bosphorus in the other. To eat outside in fine weather on such a rooftop is a true delight. In fact, we found during our week in Istanbul that a rooftop terrace was the point of pride, and justly so, for many restaurants, hotels, rug dealers and all sorts of other commerce. Day or night, to have a meal or a cup of tea in such an environment is breathtakingly beautful. And WHAT we ate was at least as nice as where we ate it. The cook at Angel's Home provided excellent meals -- an enormous variety of breakfast foods, gratis by the way, ranging from scrambled eggs and juice, fresh fruit, breads and tea or coffee for those who want to start the day with familiar American fare, to far more interesting dishes with aubergines, carrots, and other things I could not replicate but would love to eat again. And a most attentive waiter comes round the tables with some sort of cheese-filled pancakes that were spendid. Evening meals at Angel's Home include either a full menu or a choice-of-three entrees on a prix fixe menu. Depending on how many nights you say, one or more of those meals is included as well. We savored our evening meals at the Angel's Home and found the quality of the food at least as good as that of restaurants in the area costing much more. As to the decor -- one person's gracious elegance is another's oppressiveness, I suppose. Because the building itself was once the home of a Turkish admiral, whose wife's name translates to \"Angel,\" the angel motif is everywhere -- tastefully done, we thought, but if angels aren't your thing, well, there ARE a lot of little angels in around the place. I can't imagine anyone objecting. And with the angels come lots of dark red drapes and bed spreads, red, heart-shaped throw pillows and ottomans and the like. We found it charming. And yes, most of the lights in Angel's Home are connected to motion detectors -- you enter a hallway and the lights come on. We found that to be true all over Istanbul and feel that to be a very good solution to squandering many kwh of electricity keeping empty hallways brightly lit. Other bits: There is a small but serviceable gym on the ground floor, Internet-enabled computers in the lobby for guest use 24 hours a day and the whole place is wi-fi enabled, for those of us who can't venture out without our laptops. But overwhelmingly, at Angel's Home as, really, anywhere, the most important element is the courtesy and professionalism of the staff. From owner to housekeeper, from cook to waiter to bellhop, we found everyone at the hotel to be as gracious and as helpful as one could possibly imagine. Hakan himself even drove us out to the airport at 6:30 a.m. (and in his beloved and beautiful 1955 Chevrolet!). Then, at the airport, we needed a couple of phone numbers for our next desination. We couldn't find an internet connection, so I called the hotel and Okan happily looked up the website of our next desination and gave us the phone numbers. Try that at the Hyatt. Cats? Yep. There are cats in the lobby, maybe cats elsewhere, too, I can't attest to that. There are cats all over Istanbul. We found them adorable. Others, I suppose, might not. We will be back in Istabul in January on our way back to New York after a protracted trip.

The room was spotless, and the ensuite bathroom was excellent - the bathrobes, slippers and collection of toiletries rivalled much more expensive places. The staff are friendly and attentive, and the owners are utterly marvellous people. Friendly and helpful, they were happy to advise us how to explore Istanbul on our own, making suggestions to improve our forays. The trips they do offer (no hard sell at all) are good value, as they refuse the commission trip organisers pay to hotels , and insist that the saving is passed on to their guests. Yes, really! The rates are a real bargain. The hotel offers a simple evening meal which is very reasonable, and snacks at lunchtime, if you don't want to explore the neighbouring restaurants every evening. We also ate at the fish restaurant recommended by the owners, and it was reasonably priced, friendly, with live music. We even got a lift there in the cool Chevy Bel Air! On our final day I was keen to buy a couple of bags at the local Cavalry Bazaar - the previous day I had tried to bargain but had failed miserably. When I mentioned my plight, one of the owners contacted a friend of his at a local shop, who went with me to the bazaar and succeeded admirably where I had failed. How's that for service above and beyond the call of duty? We enjoyed talking to them about life, the universe and everything over a glass of tea, and wish we were still there. A great holiday experience! Everywhere we went in Istanbul we were welcomed, and given help with directions and anything else we needed. The shopkeepers in general do try and lure you into their shops, but a polite \"no thanks\", delivered with a smile, is enough. Not like our experiences in parts of Egypt and India!

Staff was very accomodating and helpful-had to leave in the wee hours of the morning and the clerks presented me with a box of Turkish sweets when I left! I would go back and take advantage of the many deals offered, e.g. terrace restaurant dinner for the first meal in Istanbul (with a stunning view-missed it), whirling dervishes (Wed.) was fantastic, belly dancing (Thurs.) was actually seen at the Music Hall (better according to locals?), Calgiglou hamam-oldest and best in Istanbul was within walking distance (women, be prepared for community of naked women bathing), breakfast was hot and delicious; overall a safe and clean place for a 2 night stay. (Istanbul was a stopover during my Greece vacation.) Recommendations: Plan ahead and to stay about a week at least-many local events/palaces are only open on certain days during the winter, MWF, or once a week, etc. I arrived Wed. and was able to see everything I wanted in 2 days but I had to take the Havash bus directly from the airport to Taksim and then taxi to Dolmabache palace as they were open only wed and then Saturday. Women should wear wedding bands, fake, etc. Turkish men are very hospitable, always offereing apple tea, but be firm and say no esp. if you have just arrived in the city and are steered towards a carpet vendor's store! The university-educated Turkish men are more touchy-feely, similar to their European counterparts? Be firm and tell them to stop touching/massaging you or you will leave. Also they may quote carpet prices as labor & cost for one month of work ($230); Be sure and get the total cost for a carpet. Expect to pay between $1200 to $4000 for a large quality silk or wool carpet. I bought a small silk one for less than $900, but everyone says I got a deal. Also, be general about questions from where you are from-I told one Turkish vendor I was from California, San Franciso, but born in Korea and every Turkish man on the block knew and would refer to me as such. Hotel perks included free internet, hot water, fluffy robe and signature slippers, and breakfast with local breads (Simit!). Feral but tame cats live everywhere (Greece too) but I had no problems (allergic).
