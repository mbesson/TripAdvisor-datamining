Room was very modern (yet small), all facilities were spotless, and there was even free wifi. Breakfast buffet was absolutely delicious and full of options. We stayed here nearly 2 weeks and didn't tire of it ( I noticed some other reviewers said it got old, but I don't know how it could have - meat, loads of cheeses, jams, breads, honey, yogurt, dried fruit, etc). Everything was great. Front desk staff was excellent and was always willing to help. They are also present 24 hrs, so no need to feel unsafe. Its a bit odd that whenever you leave the hotel you have to leave your room key with the front desk, but I suppose that serves some other purpose that I am unaware of. Never the less, someone is always present and willing to help. There is also a computer available for use in the lobby as well as an elevator to assist with the bags. Room service is available as well, which you pay for upon check out (pretty standard). Location in bustling Beyoglu couldnt be better - trust me, forget the old city, stay in Beyoglu. Its fantastic and theres always something to do. Unlike other travelers we never had a problem with noise; double-paned glass took care of any street noise (which is definitely there due to the busy area). Overall, I couldnt recommend this hotel more. Great value for the money. We were truly impressed. Oh, and one last thing; when you get a cab from the airport, they may be hesitant to take you down the main street of Beyoglu (given that it is *mostly* pedestrian). The cab driver might drop you off a few blocks away, which of course, is reallly confusing when you don't know where you are. We got lost and had to haul our bags around cobblestone streets for about 20 mins. This absolutely sucks when you're sleep deprived and cranky. Best advice: have the address handy and know it well, or just insist the cab take you to the hotel to avoid getting lost. No fun.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cCheap accomodation in the center of Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "evemauve", "ReviewID": "UR122056906", "Content": "For my second time in Istanbul , I chose to stay around the Taxim area in order to explore the modern part of the city. Hotel Residence was a perfect choice!! Just off Istiklal avenue, a few blocks away from Taxim square. The hotel's rooms are nicely furbished ,rather small , but since I was a solo traveler I was given a double room and everything was fine! Breakfast was more than adequate , exactly what I wanted to start the day! The best thing about the location was that the hotel is in the middle of Istanbul's nightlife and there are hundreds of choices for dinner or drinks The only negative thing was that the people at the reception had a little knowledge of English.

My overall impression of the place was that it was in need of a bit of a refurb. For example, in the bathroom the sink needed resealing and some of the wiring was visible, the aircon worked well - but looked really old. However, for 40euros per night for bed and breakfast in the heart of a big city I am not going to complain. The staff were friendly and always said \"hello\" - they spoke English well, the room was clean (if a bit drab), I was in room 506 on the 5th floor. The breakfast was basic - but the bread was nice and fresh and there were several different kinds of cheese which were good to try. There was also cornflakes and some kind of choco flakes if you wanted cereal, and plenty of jams/marmalades etc I It is in a noisy location and at night I could hear the muffled sounds of the local nightlife (room 506 was facing the street that the hotel is on), this was not an issue for me as I was out all day and came back quite late (walking around that area at night is so interesting - so man side streets to explore and it is so busy!).. so I was tired and went to sleep without a problem. In the morning it was distinctly quiet! I stayed for 2 nights and it was just right for me. The positives of this place definitely outweigh the negatives.

Both rooms have windows, and share a terrace. The bathroom is small, the bathtub is tiny - it's not really a bathtub, more like a deep shower taking tub. It was clean, but the toilet was leaking from the bottom, so the bathroom floor was wet all the time. I accidentally locked the door to the second room, and when going out asked at the desk for it to be fixed - it wasn't when I came back. I guess because I was out and they couldn't have tip for the job, but maybe front desk just overlooked my request. Staff speaks moderate English, but is polite.
