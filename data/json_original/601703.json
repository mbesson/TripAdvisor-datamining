Our plan was to get into rome and go back to the hotel. Our two night stay ended up being only one night as we regretted it as a choice. The neighborhood at night was one that we didn't want to be around, it seemed very sketchy and the hotel is literally in the middle of nowhere. From the airport, we had to ask about 5 different people how to get there. We ended up finding one bus that went within the area and we then had to transfer. Even with that we ended up walking for a while to reach the hotel. The hotel, being newly remodeled is one that is nice and clean. It seems that once the restaurant is up it would be nicer. However for us there was really nothing in the area, and everything else closed early so we did not want to venture out. We ended up leaving and getting another hotel in Rome that we very much enjoyed. If you want to simply see the sea, then this is a good option. However, despite it being close to the airport it is something that is NOT easy to get to. It seemed as though it was way easier and cheaper to simply get into Rome from the airport.

The room was the biggest disappointment. My daughter was locked into the bathroom while we went to park the car. It took 15 minutes to get her door unlocked. The room had this look as if it was decorated but a very long time ago. The fake modern cheap furniture with scuff marks everywhere. (A party room) The TV was so small on the wall that we could barely see it. The door would not dead bolt and when I went down to the lobby to see what could be done, the man walked up and said that the one lock was enough and the 2nd was broken and it was OK. We thought about leaving but it was late in the evening and kids were tired. We all wanted to leave but had to just suck it up and stay. When I sat on the bed, I thought \"OH MY GOODNES\" How was I going to make it through the night. It was a rock!!! I told the kids everything was going to be fine. I was not sure of that. I was scared and uncomfortable. They were very unhappy. We went to sleep and then woke up fine. We packed up got out of there and said our goodbye to the nice hotel clerk and made it through. I can see this place being OK if your expectations are not high as far as the room. The view was beautiful in the morning and right on the water. A nice balcony made the morning. We were where the boat yard was. It was a different feeling in the morning but the room was still not good. Sorry but I am giving this hotel a 2 1/2.

They even changed the TV to an American channel for us without us even asking. The 3 girls working there spoke very little English and I don't think they see many Americans. The rooms was ready in about 30 minutes. The room was nice especially because of the ocean view from the balcony. The bathroom was also very nice and modern. The bed could have been softer, but again, this is Italy! The area was all residential apartment buildings along the coast line. It was very quiet and there are several shops and restaurants at the marina. They close for a long siesta and then again at 7:30 pm. There is a McDonald's there open later though. We don't normally ever eat there, but it was the only thing open. We got fried Brie Cheese and a Hot Fudge Sundae. Where else can you get that but in Europe?

Directly across from the hotel is Roma Porto Marina to the right and a 3-4km/2-3 mile concrete beach front promenade to the left. The dark brown sandy narrow beach in front of the hotel is crescent shaped and is approximately 50 feet deep. There rocks spread out in the water and there is a shallow rock shoal 100 feet out extending up the length of the beach. As you walk up the promenade the beach widens to accomodate numerous beach/cabana clubs. Each culb has umbrellas and chairs in their repective club colors. A 150 foot concrete pier is approximately 3 km/1 mi. walk up the promenade. Walking out to the end of the pier reveals the water looks waist high out to the rocky shoal with sandy bottom. Looking both north and south of the pier one can see the numerous beach clubs and their colorful umbrellas. The avenue opposite the pier has stores, resturaunts, pizzerias. We purchased some cheese and crackers which we had on our oceanfront terrace with a bottle of Ruffino. The marina to the right of the hotel has several seafood resturaunts spread on the water side of the marina's promenade. Opposite them is a string of stores, shops, pizzerias that have a roofed`corridor to walk under. The pizzerias have chairs and tables to sit at on the promenade. The hotel has a free continental breakfast and served seafood dinner during our stay. We chose to eat dinner out as there was a small seminar in the hotels first floor meeting room and did not want to eat in a fairly full resturaunt after getting off of a cruise ship. The rooms are as described in the previous reviews. They include a safe, tv and small desk where you can enjoy hard wired internet access for 2 Euros for 1 hour, 5 Euros for 24 hours.

Throughout our trip we made all of our transfer reservations thru Rome Cabs (romecabs@yahoo.com - Stefano Costantini) which we discovered in these reviews. We were extremely satisfied with their service. They provided cars or vans and all drivers were early and held signs to easily identify them. We used them from the airport to Rome, Rome to Citivitavecchia, Citivitavecchia to the Aran Blu in Lido di Ostiga, and finally from the hotel to the airport. From Civitivecchia to the hotel in Lido di Ostiga was 130 euro. The cruise line wanted $150 for a bus shuttle to the airport upon which you would have to transfer your luggage to a taxi, at least 40 euro, to the hotel. Why bother, plus you get to the hotel earlier. They said check in is usually 4p.m. but they made a room available for us by 10:45 a.m. They will hold your luggage if you have to wait and you can walk around and explore the area while you are waiting.

I usually stay in the conference hotel but since it was my first trip outside the US in 15 years and I had a 7 a.m. flight out the next morning, I opted to stay at the hotel close to the airport. The hotel is modern, with nice marble touches for the headboard and the frosted glass panes for the minibar, closet, bathroom and door to the spacious patio. The king-sized bed was actually two twins and was without a fitted sheet. The bed was low but had two nice bendable reading lamps. The room itself was very small since the bed took up a lot of the space. There was no room to open up the suitcase and the closet was not floor to ceiling, rather up on the wall and included a safe inside. The room had central air, which was a welcome relief after a hot, humid day. The bathroom had nice slate tile, a toilet, bidet, deep tub with \"rainfall\" showerhead and also a handheld wand. There wasn't a curtain, rather thick glass that came only a third from the wall to the tub. The sink was nice and the hairdryer was powerful for being so small. The front desk was helpful, even with the computer down and being unable to locate my reservation. Their English was good (thankfully!) and they were patient with me since my Italian is very pedestrian. COMPLAINTS: It took me a while to figure out how to turn everything on. There was a fusebox in the room and the set for the lights and the TV (but not the AC or phone) was in the off position. You need to use your keycard to activate the \"do not disturb\" light on the door, which I didn't figure out until after the maid knocked on my door at 10 a.m. (I was recovering from jet lag). Even after I activated the 'dnd' sign, it only lasted for about 2 hours. Internet access? Well, it would have been nice if there had been a sign on how to access it. It wasn't until I pulled away the nightstand that I found a LAN plug, but I didn't have my cable with me. I asked the front desk for one and was told that the hotel doesn't provide it. Taxis. Well, once you're there, you're there. It costs about 40 EURO to the Fuimicino airport without a tip and my taxi to central Rome was almost 70 EUROS. This is not the place to stay if you plan on doing any sightseeing. Taxis are nonexistant, so you have to have the hotel call one for you. If you have an early flight (as in 7 a.m.), you MUST book your taxi the day before. I was fortunate in that they were able to get a cab to pick me up so early on less than 8 hours notice. \"Free Shuttle\". My travel agent talked about this as being a bonus, and after reading the reviews here, I was expecting some difficulty. What surprised me was that the shuttle was NOT to the airport, but to the train station! I didn't eat at the restaurant or have breakfast there. However, there are several small shops in the turisto porto (including McDonalds) that is to the right of the hotel. For more formal dining, there are two restaurants on the oceanfront that are about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. I don't recommend this for the solo traveller or someone with more than 1 day in Rome. This is a \"last stop\" for someone needs to get to the airport early and doesn't want too many traffic problems. Sure, the beach is nice and the hotel faces the Mediterranean, but the area is a little rough in places.", "Date": "September 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sussex", "Title": "\u201cA good hotel with lots of potential\u201d", "Author": "Keep_it_simple_simon", "ReviewID": "UR5626643", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel from 13/8/6 to 18/8/6 This is a new crisp and stylish hotel with loads of potential. It is adjacent to the newly built marina and about a mile away from the central area of lido de Ostia. Once the beach area is complete (the promenade planting and lighting isn't quite finished) this will benefit from its position between the two. The rooms are basically as good as the photos on the internet. They are clean and stylish and everything that we needed worked (can't vouch for the internet as we didn't need it). The hotel is situated in a residential area and in our opinion this is a benefit as you actually see how the local residents live their lives. The promenade is always busy throughout the evening with families walking and enjoying the seafront. I always find this a reassuring friendly feel about a holiday (lido de jesilo had a similar feel). Being closer to the sea was more refreshing with sea breezes to keep things a little cooler. Rome is only 30 mins away by metro - a 75 minute metro/bus ticket costs just 1 euro and is fantastic value. You can pick the number 1 bus up from the back of the hotel which takes you to the metro station Lido Central or walk the 1.5 miles to the metro station if you're feeling a little more energetic. The Central lido area has a few restaurants and bars. Our favorite was called \"Eat and Go\". The Marina has a few too but as it is still up and coming the choice there is a little limited. The continental breakfast was fine and made a welcome change from the full english. We were there before 9.30 most days so previous comments from other reviews about no clear tables weren't really a problem to us although we did see a bit of a rush from other guests towards the end of the session for the last few clear tables. The solarium and Gym were open throughout our stay but the roof terrace bar was not open too often however I'm not sure that the hotel was fully booked all of the time were there. There was also a variety of guests of all nationalities which indicates a broad appeal. The staff on reception were polite and courteous. Some of course had better local knowledge of the area then others and helped us find the best ways to get about. The plus points of this hotel are; New clean, stylish rooms Good rate Good location for the Marina Good potential (if rates stay good) perhaps some partnership opportunities with local authority! Large beds comfortable beds Good location for Rome (if you dont want to stay in Rome) and still want some beach. Good chance to see the real side of Italy Area's for development; Could expand restaurant facilities which at present are limited especially as nearby facilities are up and coming and a \"niche\" could be found, Provide more written information to promote the area e.g places to visit, things to see etc and in variety of languages More staff in the restaurant to cater for the late breakfast rush.

We left our luggage, walked around the little harbor, grabbed lunch, sat and watched the boats, and walked back to the hotel hoping they\u2019d let us in early...nope. Finally got in the room and unpacked and went back downstairs to the restaurant for dinner and everything I requested the waiter shock his head \u201cno.\u201d I finally just ordered a mixed drink.

I\u2019m not sure if it was because I was starving, but the tuna fish turned out to be pretty good.

The shuttle to the bus station was nice, but we quickly realized it was easier to just walk to the back of the hotel and catch the bus.
