The nearest station is a U-Bahn, Samaritestrauss, which is literally a less than 5 mins walk from the hotel towards the main thoroughfare - Frankfurter Allee. The U-Bahn system is great with regular trains into Alexanderplatz and takes approx. We also found some great pubs / restaurants going in the opposite direction from when you head to the U-Bahn. We booked the hotel approx 6 months before travelling and got a fantastic price. The hotel was immaculate, perhaps newly refurbished since Ibis took over. There was even the distinct smell of new carpets !!! It was very clean and welcoming with extremely helpful staff available at reception/ bar / restaurant at all hours. There is free Wi-Fi throughout the building, and access to a PC in the reception area. The breakfast cost \u20ac8. The room was clean and functional with a brand new large HD TV with various channels (inc BBC World News and CNN). Beds and duvets were also brand new and very comfortable although maybe not if you like a hard mattress. I had no complaints. The bathroom also appeared to be completed refurbished and very clean fantastic powerful shower too, which is a must have in a hotel.

The hotel is very close to the station meaning you can get around very easily. It was clean and the staff were friendly enough. The main reason I picked this hotel was because of the price and hope that it would be in an interesting area, which it was. It seems as though the area is somewhere that real people live, which I hoped for as I knew I would spend all of my time exploring the touristy areas and wanted the chance to see somewhere off the beaten track. The shower was good and the room was really spacious. Decor was outdated, and TV small (with only news 24 in English) but this didn't bother us as we only really need the room for sleeping and showering! Our friend also stayed down the hall, and as we had a table with three chairs in our room, this made it handy for socializing. Rooms were very quiet so we slept well. We did see others walking around so I think the soundproofing worked well, rather than it being empty! We didn't sample the breakfast as it was typically German and not the kind of thing three English people like eating on a hangover! If you're looking for a decent priced hotel with good bathroom facilities located off the beaten track then I'd recommend.

As I was travelling on my own I wanted a place that wasn't too far away from the U-bahn and that wasn't in a dodgy area or out in the sticks. Agon Frankfurter Allee ticked all the boxes and after all the positive reviews I booked myself a single room for 3 nights. The tube station is literally a 5min walk away and Frankfurter Allee is full of shops and places to eat. I was slightly worried about Kinzigstrasse at first as on the corner there is a shop that sells alcohol and there always people on the corner drinking alcohol (possibly homeless? as they were there all day and night) but I soon realised I had nothing to worry about. These people kept themselves to themselves and never bothered me at all (I am a young woman with blue hair so if anyone is going to get hassled it would be me lol!). Agon hotel is very nice and modern, I actually felt under dressed when checking in lol. The staff are really friendly and will answer any questions you may have. There is always someone on the reception too so no waiting around for ages to get info. I expected the room to be decent but it was better than expected! It was so clean it looked brand new! I was really impressed. The cleaners were really friendly and always folded up your towels neatly and made the bed to perfection. The bed was really comfy and warm, the radiators worked really well so was always nice and cosy. The shower is very powerful and gets really hot and more than enough space for luggage/clothes. There was also a tv with loads of free channels and lots of lamps so was nice and relaxing at night. Great location, very near to alexanderplatz so really easy to get into berlin.

The rooms were very odd - we booked two doubles but were given 2 twinsinstead. One room was enormous with two bathrooms including a disabled-access one, with two rooms sections with a single bed in each. Next door the second room was tiny, it was so small that the beds were end to end along the wall rather than side by side! This might be fine for friends, backpackers etc but not for couples! There was enough space for one person to walk between the beds and the wardrobe and dressing table, but not two people. The room was clean though, as was the bathroom.

The Samariterstrasse U-bahn station is about a minute's walk from the hotel. This then goes straight into Alexanderplatz, which is one of the major transport hubs in Berlin; from here the S-bahn and U-bahn lines for the whole of city are accessible. Trains from Samariterstrasse depart every 5 minutes until very late on. For this reason, it is an ideal sight-seeing base - I never find the need to pay a great deal for a hotel which we only sleep at, but I always insist on it being clean. The room was spotless and the bathroom looked brand-new. The breakfast is fanastic considering it is included in the already very reasonable price. Bread, eggs scrambled and boiled, different cold meats, cereal, yoghurt etc. It really provides an excellent start to a day's sightseeing. The hotel's environs aren't the best looking - but we never felt threatened or menaced, either on the previous visit or last week's. The area is probably undergoing a regeneration of sorts, but I actually found myself liking the character of the place. Grafiti is present, but that's Berlin (and most capital cities) for you.

There is also a great street (so sorry for forgetting the name of the street but if you walk out of the hotel, make a right and turn left at the first street and walk until you find all the bars and restaurants...you can't miss it) about a 10 minute walk from the hotel that we ate at twice in 4 days....highly reccommend: \"euphoria\" (I think it was called) was a restaurant with a huge patio and really good food that we ate at the first night we arrived. I had also heard on this site that if you had a \"special\" request for a larger room, it may be granted at the regular price.....it was great to discover that after asking for a larger room, if available, that they compensated with an apartmtent (equipped with two bathrooms and a small kitchen) at no extra charge. Absolutely perfect! Breakfast was good, but we opted for a german platter breakfast at one of the many restaurants serving there on our last day at Herkescher Markt...so huge, but a beautiful display of fruit, breads, meats and cheeses.

I heard about Bookingbuddy.com and after painstaking searching I stumbled upon this hotel. I was a little nervous about giving the Istanbul-based GTA travel my credit card to confirm the room, but finding no major complaints about them on other websites, I went ahead and confirmed. (I have since found that they are all over Europe with their hotel and tour packages as well as bus charters) Getting to the Agon Frankfurter Allee can be a little challenging, but if you buy the Berlin WelcomeCard you can travel on all modes of transportation throughout the city. We simply wheeled our bags to the transport office's desk at Tegel Airport where we purchased our WelcomeCards. It was just a few steps to the TXL bus which took us to the Alexanderplatz U-Bahn stop. From there we went 4 steps via the subway to Samaritarstrasse. The Agon is just a block over from the main street. We were a little disappointed at the graffitti-scrawled neighborhood we found ourselves in. The surrounding buildings were stark remnants of the Communist period - totally devoid of charm. The hotel was not marked with much in the way of signage, but we gravitated toward the newest, cleanest looking building which turned-out to be the hotel. The hotel itself was a complete contrast to the rundown, but safe neighborhood - the rooms were big by European standards with overly fluffy pillows and warm comforters. Bathroom facilities were new, well-supplied and very clean. For the two very cold Berlin nights that we visited, our room was toasty and featured satellite TV with CNN and BBC in English. The hotel is on a backstreet so noise was never a problem. A nice-sized elevator allowed us to bring our bags up the three flights of stairs to our room and back down to the basement breakfast room. Breakfast was fantastic. A generous buffet featuring fresh fruit and rolls. There were piles of cold cuts and cheese to create heaping sandwiches. Soft-boiled and scrambled eggs. Hot and cold cereals. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate. Even the pseudo orange juice wasn't too bad. I highly recommend this hotel. I would suggest that you either drive yourself here (ample parking for a fee inside the hotel courtyard) or be sure you arrange to start your trip at this hotel. We never would have been able to lug our souvenir laden suitcases up to the subway, then across Alexanderplatz to the bus stop at the end of our trip.

Although some have emphasized the heavy graffiti use and some other aspects of the hotel neighborhood it is just part of a normal look of this area. The neighborhood is completely safe and pleasant with no real threats 24/7 even for families. The hotel is one block south of Frankfurter Allee which is the main street crossing the area west to east. The nearest public transport station (one block away) is the U-Bahn Samariterstrasse which runs the U5 line to Alexanderplatz (less than 10 minute ride). A far away S-Bahn station \u201cFrankfurter Allee\u201d is considered to be more central but is a 10 to 15 minute walk and is not worth the effort as for most of your travel within the city you will use the nearby station and it will suffice. Getting to the hotel from the station is simple: Exit the U-Bahn and take the south side of Frankfurter Allee. On Colberstrasse or Kinzigstasse take a right (south) and then a left on Scharnweberstrasse. The hotel main gate entrance is on the street (21-23) and you need to enter the parking yard for the building entrance. The hotel has regular small rooms and \u201capartments\u201d which are large ~70 square meter rooms equipped with a shower room + toilet, another toilet room and a small kitchen. The apartments are intended for 6 people (we were a family of 5). We paid 90 Euros per day including breakfast for all of us (booked directly with the hotel). We found the apartment clean and in a very good condition. The only \u201csmall\u201d issue was the fact that the apartments face the parking area which can become noisy early morning and the fact that the ground floor windows face directly this area although for us this was really a minor issue when compared with the great convenience of this facility and its cost. The breakfast was excellent. It had all the basic stuff starting with scrambled eggs or soft/hard-boiled ones, variety of breads, sausages, chesses, tomatos, cucumbers, jam, cereals, puddings, coffee, tea, juices, milk, cakes (I think I covered all) \u2013 I really don\u2019t understand some other reviewers which felt a bit disappointed (???). As pointed out by others there are many dining opportunities nearby. For the fast food lovers (if you are with kids or just in a hurry), Burger King and Subway and numerous Pizza houses are within your grasp (our favorite one was near the Samaritestrasse U-Bahn station which served oval shaped and very tasty pizzas\u2026). You can ask the reception for more recommendations, most of them are a 10 minute walk south-west from the hotel and some are near the plaza (Mercure hotel) 2 blocks north-east from the hotel of Frankfurter Allee.

It represented good value for money and we were not disappointed. It is a small hotel, just 70 rooms, which caters for bed and breakfast. We were given a non-smoking room as requested and found it very clean with a nice sized bathroom. The bathroom had a walk in shower with shower gel dispenser, sink and toilet. The floor was tiled and everything in good condition. The towels were of a good size and changed every day. The beds were comfortable and the linen nice and white. There was a TV which had BBC World News and CNN. The carpet was clean and did not look worn. The breakfast was taken in the downstairs bar area. Again this was kept clean and tidy. The breakfast consisted of the usual tea/coffee/chocolate/orange juice, cereals, cold meats, cheeses, various breads, cake and also scrambled and boiled egg. We found it more than adequate to start our day on. The lady on duty in reception in the afternoon spoke fairly good English and was very helpful with directions on the public transport and restaurants. We travelled to the hotel from the airport by train to Alexanderplatz and then the U-Bhan to Samaritserstrs which was very inexpensive. The Hotel is ideally placed to use the public transport as the U-bhan is just around the corner. The ticket machines display English instructions too, just make sure you validate the ticket in the machine next to the ticket machine. Inspectors are frequent on the trains and fines for not having a ticket are instant. In 4 days we were asked for our tickets 3 times. The hotel is in what used to be the old eastern sector so don't be put off by the grey concrete buildings or the graffiti. In fact all the Berlin trains seems to be covered in graffiti on the outside as well as the buildings in the suburbs. Some of the train graffiti was very artistic. A lot of the buildings around the hotel are being refurbed on the outside. All in all I would not hesitate to recommend the Hotel Argon Frankfurter Allee for a short break in Berlin.

The city of Berlin is a lovely place to see and I would go back again someday but not to Hotel Agon Frankfurter Allee. I went with my husband and arrived in Schofeld Airport on Saturday 11th Novenber 2006. We decided to get the Train as we felt this would be the closest stop to our destination. The thing to be aware of is that the hotel is in the east of germany and so things there are basic. You will know the difference straight away when you travel to the west. The train station is about five minutes walk from the airport and you just have to follow the crowd, very easy to find it is sign posted in the airport. The train tickets are cheap. You can buy a day trip ticket for about 5 to 6 euro per person and it is well worth it. if you want to stay around the city a and b are ok but if you want to travel further then buy a ticket for districts a, b and c. The hotel is basic. I was very disappointed with the false advertising. The hot breakfast is hard bolied eggs and sausages one day and hard boiled eggs and scrambled eggs another day. They do supply a cold buffet and you will manage on that but it's not too exciting. There is no food available in the hotel other than breakfast. The reception desk is a section of the bar. It is really small and there is very little room for a number of guests to sit and enjoy a drink. No tea and coffee facilities in the bedrooms at all. There were two single beds pushed together to make a double and the mattresses are made of foam. If you have a back problem like me you will be in pain I can assure you of that. The temperature in the bedroom is always kept very warm so you will not be complaining of the cold in the room. Most of the staff are friendly and they will order a taxi if you need it. Another thing to be very aware of is that the hotel is stated to be in quiet residential area. The area is rough and you will be very aware of that when you get there. The picture of the hotel on the web site looks lovely. The bedroom on the web site is far from what you will be staying in when you get there. It just does not compair with reality. You have to go off the street through an arch way to find the front door of the hotel. On the street it is filthy everywhere. I would advise you to eat before you go back to the hotel at night instead of going back out to look for a restaurant. In the city you will find many nice places to eat. But closer to the hotel they are not so plentyful. I feel the hotel is certainly not a three staras advertised. I would suggest staying in west side instead. If you do the city trip for 20 euros per person you will see Checkpoint Charlie where you can get your passport stamped for 2 euros. You can also have your photo taken with USA soldiers at checkpoint Charlie for 1euro. Go to Subway opposite Checkpoint Charlie to eat. You can get Pizza or Pasta dishes all fro only 3euros. For those of you who like shopping. Go to the Galeria at Alexanderplaz, it is a huge and wonderful department store, just amazing I promise you. You will see it when you come out of the train station. C and A is also there too. I hope what I have written helps. After all this Berlin is a city we will certainly visit soon again.

I had read a recommendation of Bar Sando which is in Proskauer Strasse...nice cocktails and excellent food too!

Free internet access in reception is useful for researching sights, checking e mail etc. We arrived after 10pm and asked reception about the best place to head for something to eat. We were given a map of the local area and directed toward Simon Dach str (just head out of the hotel, cross the road and turn left along Kinzigstr. When you come to the busy crossroads go diagonally onto Grunberger Str and you will come to it - about 10 - 15 minutes walk). There are loads of good value restaurants, cafe bars, and corner shops for your bottle of wine to take back to the room! You've got to try a kebab - not greasy like in the UK, lovely salad and sauce. Breakfast is usual continental standard - cereals, rolls, continental cheeses and meats and is served until10am which means we had a nice lie in each morning. All reception staff we encountered were really helpful, English speaking and pleasant. There is a left luggage room which is a bonus if you have a later flight back. Overall I would recommend you stay in this hotel for its location to local amenities (underground station 3 mins walk, and aforementioned places to eat/drink ) and for its great value rooms and service, but its not for you if you like a picturesque stroll of a night as the street lights are dim and there is a lot of graffiti (althougth not as much as Rome).

We found it very easily after following the advice of other reviewers. We flew into Schonefeld and bought single train tickets for only \u20ac2.10 each that covered the trip to Alexanderplatz, then on to Samaritarstrasse. There was a very helpful City Volunteer at the ticket machine in Schonefeld who showed us how to use the machine. When you come out of Samaritarstrasse subway onto Frankfurter Allee, it would be helpful to have a street map, as, like us, you may find yourselves on the wrong side of the street for the hotel. The hotel is a short walk from the subway and we felt quite safe in the area, even very late at night. However, it might be advisable at night to avoid the street with the patch of wasteland and use the street further along. Some drunks hang out in the wasteland and though they didn't hassle us in any way, best to avoid them. The exterior of the hotel is nice and traditional looking, while the interior is modern, and spotlessly clean. The only downside was that the room was very small, although the bathroom was large. Breakfast was really good, and served in a nice red brick basement area. We were really glad we chose to stay in East Berlin, as the atmosphere was relaxed and eating out was very cheap. We found a restaurant called La Palma on Voigtstrasse Street, just off Frankfurter Allee, and they had the best food we've ever tasted. They serve everything from pasta to pizza to steak, and you can get a great meal with wine and beer for around \u20ac21 for two. After dinner, head to the Brazilian bar called Sando on Proskauer Strasse, where they do the best cocktails ever, really huge, for only \u20ac4. Theres a small bar in the hotel, but we didn't use it and we saw no-one else using it either. It's next to the breakfast room, and it would be great if they left this open for guests to use in the evenings, perhaps with a large-screen tv for showing videos. That way guests could socialise a bit. I find the lack of communal areas like this a big drawback in small contintental hotels. The location of the hotel is quite good as it's easy to get into the city centre, and quite quick on the subway. However, we were always glad to get back to our laidback little patch of East Berlin after all the walking and sightseeing. Our room was at the back of the hotel and was very quiet. We slept soundly, thanks to a combination of all the walking, the fabulous food at La Palma and the delicious cocktails at Sando. It was in no way thanks to the strange pillows. They're sort of flat, like miniature duvets. We had to ask for two more each, so it wasn't too bad. Another thing to be aware of is, check in is at two pm. Inconvenient if you arrive early in the morning, although you can leave your bags. Would I stay at this hotel again? Yes, if I got as good a deal again, only \u20ac216 for two of us, for four nights B&B. All in all, a memorable trip - helpful and friendly people everywhere, a wonderful city with wonderful food.

My comments would be, that you are not by any of the main tourist sites nor are you too far away either. You are just 5 U Bahn (subway) stops away from Alexander Platz. The area around the hotel has been described as rough. Well I would not be concerned going out at any hour of the day with any of my belongings and feel intimidated. The area is much like any other area. I don't think I saw one threatening or worrying looking person in my whole time in Berlin. Unlike most of Britains major towns or cities the people of Berlin seem to respect personal belongings. Many times I saw people leave their bags unattended, and their shopping on their bicycles, their bicycles unlocked, video screens on the subway unvandalised. It seems that respect of property and law and order prevails strongly still in this part of the world. The people are friendly and seem genuine and warm. There is grafitti around the hotel as there is everywhere, even in the poshest of districts there seems no room left anywhere to leave a tag. The trees, the pavement, the roads are heavily marked with spray paint. More on the location of the hotel; If you come out of the front of the hotel (only way) you turn right, then next right about 10 metres, then walk to the bottom of the street to the main road, about 100 metres then you are at the subway, (Samaritersr) approximately 2 minutes walk. From here you can travel all over Berlin and beyond for \u20ac6 per day. One of my great concerns was fathoming out how to use the subway, trains, buses etc. It could not be simpler. As you go into the subway station, walk down to the platform, there you will see a machine that dispenses your tickets. On getting to the machine, you touch the screen to select your language, select what type of ticket you want, ie single journey (about \u20ac2.10, day pass, about \u20ac5.80, or 2 day, I think? You can also choose which zones you want, A & B or AB & C. I went for AB & C as this means you can travel on the subway (U Bahn) the buses, the trams and the S Bahn (trains, but some also do go underground). One of these tickets costs just \u20ac6 per day for unlimited travel, and you can go as far north as Sachsenhausen, the Olympic Stadium etc. You can feed in notes and just about any coins. You then need to put your ticket in the little bollard shaped object next to the ticket machine to validate it. Once you've done this your ticket is valid until 3am the next morning. If you buy a ticket you can keep it for as long as you like without it going out of date, but once you've validated it (punched it in one of the bollard thingies) it will then run out at 3am next morning. If you are thinking of holding onto your ticket and hope that you can get away with the same ticket, beware! We went a full 2 days, and probably a hundred or more tube stops and no one challenged us. We went in and out of subways unchallenged. The next couple of days we were asked to show our ticket about 5 times. The checkers are usually dressed in jeans and a t-shirt and you wouldn't have a clue. If you have a ticket out of date, a ticket not validated or no ticket, you will get an on the spot \u20ac40 fine. Back to the hotel: The staff were absolutely brilliant! I reckon I saw about 4 or 5 different women receptionists and one man. Three of the lady receptionists were an absolute scream. At one point when I was using the free internet pc by the reception desk I was struggling to find the @ key, 2 of them came from behind the desk and were fighting over me to show me! (Must be my striking resemblance to Brad Pitt!) Indeed I can not praise the staff enough, they were very helpful and I had a great laugh with them. (Who said the Germans don't have a sense of humour?) My room was huge!!! I got apartment 1 which is back out of the reception into a white building opposite. As I walked in I was astounded at the size of the room. There was only myself and the wife staying, but the living room had 4 double windows, a table and chairs, a 3 piece suite, 2 single beds pushed together, a triple wardrobe, a tv with about 20 odd channels, (only about 2 English, BBC World and CNN), a writing desk and chairs, a mini bar. The hallway led onto a bathroom with sink, toilet and shower, then down the corridor to another bathroom with toilet and sink, then onto the kitchen with a sink and cupboards and a little cooker. Great room, but massive. Breakfast in the morning was served to the left of reception which is in the cellar of the main building. You can tell that the building is a converted warehouse, but well done and pleasantly renovated without being flashy. The food was not bad, typically, a couple of cereal options, boiled or scrambled eggs, fresh fruit salad with lychees, pineapple, mango, guava, various dry German breads, cheese cold meats, selection of very nice yoghurts, cakes, jams and a few other things. you get a pot of coffee on your table. The clientele of the hotel seem to be mainly German with a few Brits, Americans, Canadians, French, Dutch and Italians making up the rest. It is for this reson that you will have half a dozen people staring at you for the entirety of the time you eat your breakfast. I don't know why Germans do this, but you just have to ignore it. Out and about round the hotel: I could not believe it when I got the bill for the food in the various bars and cafes in the vicinity. I thought I would try one of the highly recommended authentic Turkish kebabs, they come in a 12\" pizza base style bread with sesame seeds and comprise of sliced chicken, all the salad and choice of dressings. This is a decent sized meal. I had one of these, my wife had the veggie equivalent, I had a pint of best beer, and a bottle of diet coke for my wife. The bill was less than \u20ac6 (I've paid more than that for a pint of beer in Budapest, Prague and Moscow) in a capital city of one of the worlds leading economies. This was commonplace around not just this area, but the whole of Berlin, the food seems so cheap. There is a cafe opposite the hotel which I went to and bought a couple of turkey salad baguettes, a couple of egg mayo barm cakes a donut and a bottle of sprite and that was only \u20ac6. And the food seems to be good wherever you go. Anything else about the location of the hotel? I witnessed a group of about 3 or 4 drunks that hang out near the corner shop to the left of the hotel as you look at it, they look away as if embarassed to offend and quickly move. I was delighted I stayed at the Agon Frankfurter Allee and would highly recommend you stay there. I loved the people of Berlin, I thought every person bar none went out of their way as much as possible to help often a bit embarassed at their lack of knowledge of English, but tried their best. A few general points about Berlin: There is a fair bit of work going on, on the undergrounds. There are a few delays because of this, nothing to be worried about, usually about 10 minutes you have to get off the train and back on again, and usually in the evening. The subways get hot as they don't have air con, and a lot of them run over ground. The checkpoint Charlie Museum lets too many in at once and is packed out with kids screaming and acting about. It's expensive at \u20ac9.50 each, you pay lots of extras and you can't use your camera. You can go up the Reichstag dome for free for great views, but the queues can be long if you go mid morning to early afternoon. The city is truly massive, so plan where you want to go and be prepared to sit for hours of your visit on the subway/bus/tram.", "Date": "May 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cA surprise in East Berlin\u201d", "Author": "travellers067", "ReviewID": "UR5007144", "Content": "This hotel is situated five metro stops from Alexanderplatz at Samariterstrasse in East Berlin.

A nice clean, huge bathroom was also a bonus. We booked and got a non smoking room, which we were glad of, after reading some of the previous comments. The staff were helpful but we didnt see them much. Breakfast was also good, a good selection of cold meats, bread, fruit and cereals. The area around the hotel is good, only 5 station stops from the centre, more local with shops slightly cheaper and yet there are still some cools bars (lounge 11) and cute little restauraunts alsongside local pubs if you fancy it. The main areas we explored were alexanderplatz, Haschescher Markt, Potzdamerplatz and Zoologischer Garten. All great! Definately recommend the insider tour walk of the city, half a day tour of the main tourist sights gets them all done quickly and in detail of youre not staying long, great guides, really informative and helpful, they meet outside AMPM at the Haschescher Markt Station around 10.30 everyday i think. Also meeting there is a 3 times a week pub crawl which we definately recommend! Met some great people and get out of the touristy bar scene a little, good experience, and alcohol included in the price, the guides also just as up for it as the tourists! If you are planning on going out, heres a tip - don't get dressed up much, Berlin is a laid back city and no-one was dressed up in more than jeans in all bars and clubs. Also highly recommended is a trip up the TV tower!Although costing 7.50, definatly worth it, sit in the revolving restauraunt for a drink! Amazing! Visit Zoologisher Garten for some shopping, especially KaDeWe (aka German selfridges)buy some cake on the 6th floor - HEAVEN!!! Also a great Italian restauraunt called Ferri's next to the Levi's shop i think - good value and tasty. At Potzdamer Platz visit the Sony Centre and the Austrailian restauraunt - again very tasty and good value. All in all food is relatively cheap in Germany, however drinks expensive. For those looking for familiarity, the Hard Rock Cafe at Zoologisher Garten is easy enough to find and has entertainment every wednesday with food slightly cheaper. Definately buy a travel ticket, the public transport is great, runs into the night (however not through the night, like we were told!) and turns up exactly on time and is very regular! Taxis are also much cheaper than your average. All in all Berlin is a great city, and the Frankfurter allee is a good choice, although off the beaten track, easy and quick to get to and even in a taxi from main attractions cost no more than 15 Euros.

The hotel put me in mind of a travel lodge, or a Howard Johnson chain hotel. It definately served its purpose, somewhere to sleep and have a shower. The bedding and bathroom were both sparkling clean. The room was warm, and included bedside lockers, a desk with a TV, and a wardrobe. So, if you are literally having 40 winks, and then out for a day of sightseeing its fine. Breakfast was served from 7am till 10am. Lots to choose from including; breads, cheeses, cold meats, scrambled egg, boiled egg, cereal, chocolate cake, chocolate custard, yoghurt, fresh fruit, the list goes on!Truly a great selection and very filling. Now here are the more negative points... The hotel is in the East of the city, and the surrounding neighbourhood is pretty grim. Lots of grafitti, lots of dog dirt, you get the idea. There really wasn't much of an atmosphere if you wanted to go out in the evening. The hotel 'bar' consists of about 6 barside stools. The area beyond this is the breakfast area, which is not opened at night. So, if you think you will get to know other guests at the hotel, your wrong, as no one was ever at the bar the entire time we stayed! I think they have a couple of beers on tap and a few bottles of wine etc, its by no means fully stocked. Finally, and this is my biggest complaint, they do not appear to have double beds. We booked a double room aprox three months in advance and arrived to discover two singles pushed together. There wasn't even a double duvet, just two singles! This was ok for a nights sleep, but if you have a romantic break in mind i would definately pass! On inspection of the photographs on the website, we discovered a chair had been cleverly placed at an angle to cover the join of the two beds. I think this is a pretty sneaky technique, and in my opinion suggested that the hotel knew their bed arrangements were not quite up to scratch. The smoking versus non smoking rooms as a lot of people have discussed, does seem to be a problem. We booked requesting smoking. Rang to confirm closer to our departure and was told unfortunately only non smoking was available. Arrived, and low and behold an ashtray in the room! So it's really hit or miss! If you are a non smoker good luck!! All in all, it's a good budget hotel. Close to the U bahn, all major attractions can be reached easily. We bought the day ticket for about 5 euro each and so could zip back and forth across the city all day.
