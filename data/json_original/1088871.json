You are a 10 minute walk away from the MRT and the hotel is quite close to Chinatown (20 minute walk). Food is alright but it is a no frills no fuss place so don't expect to be pampered. There's a small gym too (about 3-4 machines) but no one ever seems to go so you can exercise in privacy.

All I had to go on was a map, and did not know if this hotel was centrally located and how far from everything! From the airport it was a 20.00 Singapore dollars ride. The hotel is a short 4 minutes walk from China town and a short 6 minutes walk to the MRT subway station: OUTRAM PARK. With this in mind this hotel is thus very centrally located. It is within easy reach of Little India, Orchard Road Shopping area, as well as Kampong Glam, the Arab Area and the Marina Area, which is home to the Sands Hotel with a viewing platform up 57 stories. The staff at the Hotel Re is very pleasant and professional as well as helpful. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are equally clean. We stayed in room 1206 with a nice view toward \"downtown\" Some people complain about the size of the rooms. We found it spacious, in fact much bigger than most hotels in Europe that charge twice as much. I use a hotel to sleep and shower.

I have stayed at a couple of other places in Singapore, but I find the Hotel Re! is modern, and I really like the retro theme they have going. The regular rooms are of a reasonable size, and when I stayed in them I certainly wasn't cramped, and their suites are quite large, with a big ensuite bathroom, and ante-room leading to the bedroom. In the suite, I had some mixed results with the wi-fi on one occasion, but this was solved by just going down to the lobby with my laptop. However, now I have an iPhone, which might be annoying if the wi-fi was a little dodgy, but maybe it was just a fault that day. On the two other occasions I stayed there, I found no such problem. The rooms are very clean, and well air-conditioned, and at a fair price. There are some room snacks & drinks, but I didn't indulge. The breakfast bar is pretty good, although one thing that disappointed me last time was that the scrambled eggs had all sorts of wierd stuff in them, and the chef refused to cook me some plain scrambled eggs when I asked (even though he wasn't busy at the time). I had asked and received plain scrambled eggs on the two previous trips that I was there, so I hope the Hotel Re! can make it so that you just get plain scrambled eggs. However, try the watermelon juice they serve - that is great. I also liked the bar, which I think was located on the 5th floor. It's a great place to watch English Premier League games, although the beer was a little overpriced. I paid something like $12sg for a Hoegaarden beer. Hotel Re! is located right by the Outram Park MRT, and therefore, provides easy access to the rest of Singapore island (this MRT services two metro lines). I left the hotel via the MRT, took a bus across the causeway, and was in Johore Bahru (Malaysia) within an hour. From Outram Park MRT, there is a direct train to Changi Airport, and I found it took about half an hour from hotel to departure hall. It should be pointed out that to get to Hotel Re! from Outram Park MRT, you take the road that flanks the park heading up to Pearl's Hill, but continue walking almost to the Central Expressway. There is a small cul-de-sac to the right about 50m before you reach the expressway, so take that, go up the concrete steps (sometimes awkward with luggage !), and you are in the Hotel Re! carpark. Google Maps shows adequately where the Hotel Re! is located. Having stayed at the Hotel Re!, I wouldn't consider another option at this point. I am most likely returning to Singapore in the middle of 2012, and I will again be booking at the Hotel Re! - I hope I get a suite again !", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bali, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cDecent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Denny L", "ReviewID": "UR125345889", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Hotel Re!.

We were charged for wine which we never ordered. We explained to them that we were already in our room by the time the receipt is printed. The manager on duty, named Daniel let us check out with the void order of wine. We then received a call from him again, and this time he said that we did ordered the bottle of wine. My partner asked him to check again on this matter as we did not even purchase any wine, be it as a room service or dine in. We were frustrated by the false accusation. We waited for them to get back to us on the matter and we received the call the following day. This time, we received an apology call from Daniel. He truly apologized on the accusation and explained to us with details on what happened. They managed to track the CCTV system and it was not us who stepped out from Re!Wine. Hence, it was a genuine mistake and they have taken a necessary action on it. One of the guests poked our room number by mistake; I really hope it wasn\u2019t intentionally. Despite this occurrence, we were satisfied by the recovery service and since it was an honest mistake we decided to let it by. It was not a bad experience at Re!, however we really felt that we had quite a great stay there.

Frankly I knew I wouldn't like this hotel, it's not the kind of place I'd ever choose, and I'm a little surprised that Singapore Airlines use it. The hotel is actually a converted school, and it feels like it! The location is not great. I like walking, but when I ventured out of the hotel it seemed to be in the middle of nowhere, and in the heat, knowing I was there for just one night, I just couldn't be bothered to start walking looking for signs of civilisation. Surprisingly the restaurant closes early so as a stopover hotel it's not too convenient. However the staff were friendly and this made my unscheduled stay far less painful than it could have been. To summarise, it's a very basic hotel converted from a former school building, with a very tacky pop music theme ???!! mediocre rooms, a rather average restaurant that closes early, and it's in the middle of nowhere so you'll need taxis. One more thing (and I'll never understand why any hotel would allow this)..the shower head didn't even fit in its holder which meant you had to hold the shower with one hand. Any hotel must meet a few basic requirements..bathing, sleeping, eating, so it amazes me that that any hotel that caters to tired international travellers could have a shower that doesn't function properly!", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "bilkeys", "Title": "\u201cComfortable and clean\u201d", "Author": "bilkeys", "ReviewID": "UR52349390", "Content": "Hotels in Singapore are quite pricey for what you get, but at Hotel Re, i found it compared well to others I have stayed at.

We were set down for a few minutes untill they could find a room for us as they were full.- After three or four minutes one of the staff came up to us and told us that he saw that we are on our honeymoon and that they are upgrading us to the Business Room on the top floor \u2013 this is three grades above what we reserved!! This was totally unexpected and I'm still grateful for this \uf04a Oh yeah \u2013 the rooms and the hotel itself are very very clean. Now for some useful tips: Location \u2013 I saw that some people think that location is not really good and I have to disagree. I landed at Changi around 11am and I was in the hotel maybe one hour after landing (take in account custom control etc.). Outram park station is on the MRT line which starts at Changi Airport and it took us around 30min with that line from Changi to Outram Park Station. When we exited the station we went on the \u201eback\u201c exit and we saw the big sign \u201eRe! Hotel\u201c there showing us the way. It took us maybe 5-10min walk to get to the hotel (with luggage). It is very close to Chinatown so there is definitely no need to take MRT to go to Chinatown, just walk for 5 minutes from OP station and you will be there. Connectivity - I think that this is a good location as Outram park Station has two main lines that operate on it \u2013 \u201eEast-West\u201c and \u201eNorth-East\u201c. First one will take you in a matter of minutes to some crucial spots in Singapore like Bugis, Raffles Place, City Hall etc. And with North-East line you have only one stop to Harbourfront and Santosa express and on other side you can access Orchard road if you go to Dhoby Ghaut station \u2013 that is basically east end of Orchard road. Shuttle Service \u2013 Re has a good shuttle service if you don't like taking MRT and it's free. It starts from Re every hour on the top of the hour and it can take you to: Outram Park station, Clark Quay, Orchard Road etc. Great service even if you use it only to get to MRT OP station To conclude \u2013 I would recommend this hotel to everyone. It's quiet, peaceful and I felt lika I'm home there in every sense of the word. Staff was friendly, intimate. In KL I stayed in Sheraton in much much bigger room and everything else that comes with 5* hotel, but I couldn't wait to get back to Re, and I'm sure that this will be my hotel of choice whenever I go to Singapore.", "Date": "August 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for Singapore stop.

A super tiny room, i think the 712 was the left over space but still need to fit in a room to maximise the hotel. The shower cubicle had curtain instead of door, just give you the impression of the those really really cheap hotel on the street, the shower head holder was broken and fixed by amateur with a rusty screw, but still not holding the shower head at all(they fixed it properly when complained tho), the curtain was useless. A huge lack of ammenities and since we stayed there before, we asked for them and the obvious reply, we do not provide this,(not sure if that was the training buzz word) to get rid of you.

The driver has decided to please one of the customer who was leaving by going all the way to bugis just for them.

Space in the bathroom was very limited. The hotel's trendy design may or may not be to your liking ( I like ! ) but it can't disguise that the Hotel is still a modified school. As you enter the building it looks like the YMCA. The absence of a garden or pool confirm this as a night stop retreat only and not somewhere you'd wish return to - to escape the midday sun. The slightly out of town location needn't be much of an issue. Taxis are quite cheap ( about 6S$ to town ) or a 5 minute downhill walkway to the Outram MRT station is easy if you're fit - remember the heat and gates at the hotel exit are locked at midnight. Also be aware that many taxi drivers have never heard of the new Hotel Re so you need to keep a map and address handy. Less happily we had an issue with the billing. I booked directly using the Hotel's own website and ordered a room with breakfast. On arrival things were not quite as agreed but we appeared to resolve the issue and continued our stay. On checkout the bill totals didn't appear unreasonable but the room rate had been crossed out and a higher one put in.It was suggested that I must have agreed to that as my signature was at the bottom of the sheet. I knew nothing of that alteration and had not initialled it. I don't think that there was any malpractice it just seemed that there was confusion over what the internet site lets you book and how they interpret things at the front desk. All I would suggest is that you check your bill carefully on arrival and at departure. To conclude the staff were generally helpful and friendly but no more that I would expect. The food was adequate. For us the killer was the cold atmosphere. It may be that the Feng Shui expert got it wrong but more likely that once a school always a school and the staff are perhaps inexperienced in genuine hospitality. There was no charm about the place. That extra oomph! that makes a great place to stay has nothing to do with start ratings. It's that feeling that you are surrounded by people who care and want you to experience the best.

There were not a whole of reviews at the time as it is a new hotel, but I had a couple of experienced travelers tell me that though the rooms are small we could expect a clean and comfortable place. So we went ahead and made the reservation and I was really hoping that it would turn out at least decent, since we were traveling with an infant. We got to the hotel around 3AM in the morning with a boatload of luggage and though we were not lucky enough to get an upgrade, we got the room we booked - a deluxe. It had a Queen bed, two chairs, flat screen TV mounted on wall, phone, mini bar, coffee maker, snacks and bottled water. I think an iron and ironing board too. The bathroom had a stand in shower and a wash and loo area. All the products were of the L'Occitane Verbena line, which I absolutely loved. The main thing that really impressed me was the cleanliness...so though the space was small compared to other hotels, we felt good about the room. The pack n play we were given was very clean too. Most of the staff were friendly and professional. And even though the room was small, we were able to manage well as they let us keep most of our luggage except what we wanted in their locker room, which was a big plus. About food, the only thing we had at the restaurant was Eggplant Parmigiana and it tasted heavenly. We were very impressed with it. Now for the cons, the Concierge could definitely have been much more knowledgeable and helpful. The shuttle seemed mythical to us, since in the 3 days were there (Fri, Sat & Sun), it was never available and the walk down the hill to the MRT station while carrying the baby, stroller, diaper bag etc...was painful. If they can fix these 2 things, the hotel for us was an absolute joy. On the whole, I would easily give the hotel a 4 out 5.

Hence I decided rashly and booked a themed suite (the one with the jacuzzi) for a night's stay. Till now I am still wondering why I did it. The hotel was a little too challenging to find. Gotta thank Mighty Minds for the trusty old street directory. Upon reaching Hotel Re!, I must admit their front desk staff (2 friendly ladies when i checked) was its only saving grace. They made check-in a breeze, not much of the \"er\"s & \"huh\"s like other 5 star hotels I have stayed with. The 1st suite I was led to, had a faulty card slot i.e the \"thing\" tat you slot your hotel key into when one enters a hotel room. The door stopper was also dislodged, exposing the sharps screws which were in danger of piercing my bare feet. Waited a good 10-15mins before I confirmed it was genuinely faulty. So I proceeded back to the front desk to highlight this matter, since it took quite a while for help to come after a call to the front desk. Btw forgot to mention one of my key cards was faulty as well. The front desk tried to expeditiously resolve this matter by offer me another room. Though the 2nd room did manage light it up, it came with problems as well. The 2nd room did light up (Huge sigh of relief!) But after a look around the room, it also came with major faults Firstly, there was a misplaced ceiling panel, leaving a gaping hole above my head. I would have been fine with it, if helmets were a prerequisite to enter a hotel room Secondly, my jacuzzi was unusable as its stopper was missing!! Argh! Back to the front desk I went to highlight these matters. Thank God I was smart enough to leave my stuff in the car before proceeding to my room. Anyway decided not to wait to settle down in my room and left the hotel compounds for dinner. This time I discovered things that I took for granted in my other hotel stays. The toilet didn't have any soap, ended up washing my hands with the L'Occitane body wash.. The room also didn't have any utensils like fork or spoon, only teaspoons. Mind you, not all food products can be consumed with a spoon! Sadly I also realized later in the night that computer usage is also chargeable, regardless of room type. Guess the only benefit of having a suite was the jacuzzi. Finally, I was late for check out, over slept due to all the disappointments I had the day before. Thankfully the front desk staff was flexible enough not to implement any surcharge, which I am definitely grateful for. For cost of this room, even with 50% off, I would have gone to any other hotel and gotten a premium room or club room. Hotel Re!

The bad: Upon arrival, the manager tells us he doesn't have a double room available (even though we showed him the confirmation that we had booked a double). His attitude was virtually couldn't care less. There was no apology. Upon my insisting he says he will see what he can do as the hotel is apparently fully booked. When I checked the following day all he could offer us was a windowless double room. We had booked via an agent (Air Asia package) so perhaps the price wasn't as high as the hotel might charge someone who comes in off the street, but that does not excuse shoving us in cheaper rooms. The compact rooms include an en suite but the air con unit is piped to allow water vapour to flow into the bathroom. This results in a large puddle of water right in the middle of the WC and wash facilities (see photos). It would have been more sensible to pipe into the separate shower area if anywhere, but instead you have to wade through water every time you want to use the loo or wash your hands. When we raised this with the hotel the solution of the housekeeper was to keep a bathmat on the floor at all times. Consequently that bathmat was totally sodden at all times. I hasten to add that the housekeeper was very pleasant and polite and was clearly used to this issue being raised, but the \"solution\" was far from adequate. Of the twin beds, one of the covers was heavily stained. Though changed immediately upon my raising a complaint, it should not have been left on the bed in the first place. The kitsch decor suggests a sense of fun which is sadly lacking from the staff members, particularly the duty manager. It's rather jarring to see a hotel marketed as a fun and trendy place populated by certain members of staff who are po-faced, sullen and unhelpful.

There is a S$25 surcharge for cab rides between midnight and 6AM. We had enough cash to pay, but it would have been helpful to be informed of this before hand. Lastly, the hotel's internet is something like S$10.70 per hour with taxes, and is very high speed. I would definitely consider staying here again.", "Date": "May 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bobbyjo49", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location, staff great\u201d", "Author": "bobbyjo49", "ReviewID": "UR27754270", "Content": "Stayed her for 5 days on way back from oz.

The room was great with a/c and a small fridge and tea/coffee making facilities, nothing was too much trouble for the staff especially the chap in the wine bar!!. One point to bear in mind, the concierge staff were reluctant to book us the airport shuttle and suggested a taxi, they probably get some sort of payoff.

The hotel looked exactly as it presented on their website and the owners have successfully recreated an interesting 60's feel about it throughout. We liked the zanny way, they utilised their \"Re\" branding on fittings and furnishings and have used this to name all the hotel services such as \"Re-vive\" (restaurant), \"Re-lax\" (Spa) etc. When we checked in and asked for a purple room (because that is my favorite colour), we were upgraded without any further charge, which we thought was a very nice touch. Our room had all sorts of interesting nooks and crannies and was very hip with padded silver head board and purple people sillouette on wall. The bed was very comfortable and had a useful electronic control panel on the bedside table for lights, a/c, etc. The suite also had a modern large flat screen TV, free internet connection and a panoramic view of the city.

She put us in a deluxe room, with bathtub, @ no extra cost. 3) Toiletries provided are L'Occitane, an expensive brand. 4) The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were fluffy. 5) Wi-fi is free and fast. 6) The TV is LCD, though there are just a few English channels. 7) Local calls are free. 8) They have free shuttle buses to specific points within the area (Outram MRT station, Clarke Quay, etc.). 9) The hotel is just a 5-minute walk to the Outram MRT station. Though it is near a busy road, the noise did not reach our room on the 6th floor. We were able to sleep soundly at night. 10) The lift is spacious and clean. 11) The lobby and other decors are funky. 12) You can borrow umbrellas in case there is rain. They lent us one on our first day when it rained hard. One minor blemish is that the restaurant does not operate 24 hours. We almost did not make it when we went for a late dinner at 10 PM. They still accommodated us though. Another complaint is that our bath robes were not replaced daily. You have to explicitly put the robes on the tub to remind the housekeeping staff that you want the towels and robes replaced. Once, we forgot to do so because we were in a hurry to go out. We left our robe on the bed. When we got back, we found the same robe folded on our bed.

Check-in went pretty smooth and they gave me an upgrade (superior to deluxe) when my preferred room wasn't available but they offered to change my room again as soon as one was. Room was still quite small, but clean and comfortable. Like the entire hotel, the room design was interesting and I didn't mind the bright colours and silhouette art on the wall.

Housekeeping did a good job, room service was quick and the guy at concierge even got the shuttle bus to send me to Cineleisure when a cab was not available although generally, calling up a cab is not a problem - usually just a 5 min wait. My favourite though was the bartender - friendly guy, made good conversation while I waited at the bar for friends and did his job very well. I forgot his name but thumbs up to him. The cafe/restaurant didn't seem to be operational all the time and I was also informed that spa services were only available through bookings. Neither mattered to me though.
