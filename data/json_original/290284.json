I know all staff at the check in desk, as I have been here many times. They are all nice and are all willing to help you with whatever you may need. This is a very nice oceanfront hotel with reasonable rates. It is always clean. I always have an oceanfront room and it is always clean and smells fresh. This hotel has a nice oceanfront pool deck, with heated pool and hot tub. It is so calming and relaxing to just sit on the balcony and see and hear the ocean after I have had enough sun and water on the beach for the day. They also have an underground parking garage, which is a plus, keeping your car out of the sun and it is not extremely hot when you get in it to go some where. There is a Burger King right across the street, very convenient, if you need to walk over and grab something quick. The employees at this hotel are nice and friendly, they are always willing to help if you need something or just need information, they all work hard to provide a nice clean hotel for their guest. I commend the house keepers, they work really hard to provide a nice clean and comfortable room for their guest. Housekeepers have one or the dirtiest jobs there is, as some of the guest don't care what they leave behind as long as they don't have to clean it up. I always give the housekeepers a break. I just ask for towels, coffee, and etc..I tidy up before I go out to the beach each morning. I believe in helping others to make their day a little better. I recommend, Inlet Harbor Restaurant (crab cakes are awesome) and Charlie Horse Restaurant (all the crab legs you can eat). My Grand kids love it here also. I treat them to a mini beach vacation every year. I brought them here last year for 5 nights and they still talk about it.

The rooms are spacious and extremely clean. Each room has a private balcony to watch the sunrise from, which I did. I also ate supper out there too and sat at night prior to turning in. The amenities are many for this level of hotel. On the beach side they have a large tiled deck with lounge chairs and tables and chairs with umbrellas. The large, clean pool is next to the deck which overlooks the Atlantic Ocean. At the opposite end of the deck is a hot tub. I didn't make use of this. On the bottom floor is the deck and pool area access and that is where the vending is. Kind of a walk but it is all in one place. There's also some arcade games at the same spot. And while walking around I found a shuffle board court just waiting to be used. The motel has two parking areas, one topside and another underground which protects you from the always changing Florida weather. Also on the grounds is a small coin laundry with two washers and two dryers. The room I stayed in was a good sized, older style motel room, recently renovated and very clean and new looking. Mine came with two queen beds, a nice table and chairs, a new GE large mini-fridge, and a large Goldstar microwave. I did not peak into the large pine cabinet to check out the TV as I wasn't there to watch television, but to get quiet and read. The bathroom was on the small size but normal for older properties. It had a full tub, vibrating shower head, and a single sink. And the bathroom has a door for privacy. Understanding that it's not the Ritz, the Days Inn Tropical Seas is a very simple, clean, and comfortable room at a decent price.

There was a vacant lot next door so there was not another building right on top of you.

The Ocean front was a larger room with better layout but the view was not as good; you only got to see a slice of the ocean, not much else.) The room was a bit small and dated and it is an older hotel but again, for the money we have no complaints. They had two computers in the lobby which was a plus since I don't have a laptop. Most Days Inns include breakfast but not this one. Not a show stopper but just keep that in mind if you are expecting breakfast to be included. The beach of course was the main selling point here. Yes, cars do drive on it but that is true for most of Daytona. What I liked was there was a good stretch of sand that was above water level. In some parts of Daytona the water covers the whole beach, depending on the tide but not here. If you set yourself up about where the cars park you are good for the entire day.

Many of the events were held a mile up the road at the \"upscale\" (for Daytona) Shores Resort, and I quite honestly didn't want to spend the kind of money they charge for rooms that are merely average. Nor did I want to deal with the hassle of taking 10 minutes to walk to my car that would have to be parked across the street and over a pedestrian bridge to avoid unnecessary parking/valet fees they impose even during Daytona's slow season. There are many choices in Daytona Beach, but I'm extremely happy that I chose the Days Inn Tropical Seas. Why? Well, it's got everything you really need for a beach hotel: -Direct Oceanfront Location -Large, clean pool and hot tub (tons of lounge chairs and tables with umbrellas) -Right across the street from a convenience store, Burger King, and a pretty good bagel/deli shop -Lots of free parking (I always found a spot in the front parking lot, but there is additional space in the parking garage). -One of the closest hotels to Dunlawton Blvd., which is the last bridge on the barrier island. This will get you to Interstate 95 in about 10 minutes (maybe 20 in the very worst traffic). -You're close to the nicer restaurants and relative tranquility of Ponce Inlet to the south, while you can be amongst the more trafficked and touristy Daytona Beach to the north too when you want that. -The rooms have all that you could really need. Some have kitchenettes, while almost (maybe all) the others will have a large mini-fridge and microwave, couch, table+chairs, closet + ironing board, etc. If you need things like a mini-bar, room service, concierge service, or spa treatments, you wouldn't even be reading this review right now. The only things I can think of as cons: -While there is coffee in the room off the lobby where the computers and a nice flat screen tv reside, there is no breakfast (free or otherwise) of any kind on the property. -On the food note, there is no on-site restaurant. That would be a nice convenience, but there are tons of other places to eat close by. -I could imagine the pool area can get loud during busy times, but that holds true anywhere and it was quiet during my stay. -The sliding doors to the balconies don't have screens, so you must make sure that birds and other wildlife don't get in the room when you want to enjoy the sound of the waves and feel the breeze :) -The wi-fi wouldn't connect on my BlackBerry. I didn't bother pursuing this because I didn't bring my laptop and didn't come here to sit on the internet. It probably would have been resolved if I asked the front desk, as they took care of me with everything else. The voice/data signal for Sprint was adequate. -Again, if you're seeking the amenities and frills found at higher-end hotels, you won't be looking here anyway. I haven't reviewed a property here on TripAdvisor in years, and I felt strongly enough about this place to share my positive experience with you. That right there says it all. To sum it all up, if you want a nice, clean and very reasonably priced oceanfront place to hang your hat during your stay in the Daytona area, then stop looking and book here at the Tropical Seas! If Eddy is working at the front desk, tell him that Will from Schenectady, NY sent you :) While nothing is perfect, you cannot go wrong here.

Our in-room coffee maker stopped working (we make a LOT of coffee) and we let Eddie at the front desk know on our way down to the beach for a walk, by the time we got back (about 20 minutes later), there was a new coffee maker in our room! When I went to the laundry room to wash clothes, one washer was in use, and the other had been used and the previous user left a lot of sand in the bottom of the washer. I told the front desk clerk and was told it would be taken care of immediately. I came back to the laundry room ten minutes later and the washer was totally clean and ready for use. That is the kind of service you get at Days Inn Tropical Seas. And speaking of laundry, I was a quarter short and mentioned to one of the maintenance staff (I think his name was Steve) that I needed to go back to my room for a quarter and he said, \"Wait just a minute!\" Sure enough, he came back with a quarter for me so I didn't have to go back up to my room for it.

We called about 6pm and told them we wanted to add a night to the room we reserved. Rachel told us that our room was booked for the night, but we were given a free upgrade to an oceanfront room for the entire stay, no extra charge.

After spraying the room with perfume and leaving the balcony door open for a bit, the smell went right away. The location is great if you simply plan on staying at the beach all day. If you want to walk to the main pier, it's about a 5 mile walk and not really worth it. The pool and hot tub were both clean and never too crowded. Beware though, that during this time of the year the whole beachfront turns the lights off due to the endangered turtle's mating season. The staff were all excellent. They answered all of our questions about directions and attractions. We even lost a beach blanket one night and the grounds crew held onto it until we called looking for it, then they delivered it to our room for us.

We usually book at Beach Quarters, but this hotel offered a better deal. They upgraded us to an ocean front and like always with every hotel on the beach, the view was fabulous! The room was big and clean. The front desk, I believe her name is Rachel was very helpful and had a great personality. When checking out, Eddy was just as great. Every time but once, when I went or came into the hotel, I was greeted by someone. It had a pool and a hot tub but I used neither so I cannot comment on them. The hotel was under renovations on their carpet. We were on the 3rd floor and sometimes we could hear pounding but it really wasn't bothersome. BTW, I was told the 3rd floor was completely non-smoking, and the 6th floor was half and half. We were almost right across from the elevator and I read about people complaining, but I really didn't hear or maybe I didn't pay attention to any elevator noise. There is a Burger King right across the street and the main pier is some miles up to the north but the Sunglow Pier which you can see down the beach from the hotel, has a restaurant with some awesome food and fishing. it cost to go out on the pier to fish, I believe it is $7.00 plus tax for all day and if you want to walk to the end of the pier, it is a $1.00. Just down the road under the bridge, is some good places to eat and a nice fishing dock. Port Orange is just across the bridge with shopping and restaurants; I would say within a 5 mile radius of the hotel. The hotel does have underground parking, but we just used the front lot which was great, so I can't comment on the parking garage. I also read somewhere on the reviews either here or other places about this area not being safe. I have been to this area over the last 1 1/2 years and never felt 'unsafe.' I have no clue what those people are talking about because to me, I do see this as a great area. CONS: AC can be a little noisy, but I found it refreshing just to open the doors of the balcony and let the fresh air in. Overall, a nice place to spend a few days in this area. If you are a tourist, then this may not be the place for you since the main street pier and shopping is, I would say about 5 miles down the road.

Also the pool was packed Saturday night and Sunday morning because so many kids were in the pool. We couldn't even get in at all. Spent over $200.00 for the weekend and in all honesty it was horrible. Also the room was VERY small. The pillows weren't even regular size pillows, they were travel size pillows. Oh, and I forgot my room key in the room on Saturday andthe guy at the front desk asked me what room I was in and I told him and he just gave me a new key. No questions asked. No id shown, nothing! Pretty scarey. And no he hadn't seen me there or anything before that time.

We have always found the rooms to be clean and comfortable and the staff very helpful. This time...it was a bit of a different story. We had reserved three non-smoking rooms ahead of time, but when we arrived (in the early afternoon), the rooms they had available for us were two non-smoking rooms and one smoking room. All the other non-smoking rooms were occupied. This presented a bit of a problem since several family members are allergic to smoke. It required some shifting and problem solving on our part to make the rooms work for our family. When we left our rooms to go to the beach the next morning, we left the DO NOT DISTURB signs on our doors since some family members were leaving valuable items in their rooms and simply did not want anyone to enter our rooms. Imagine our surprise when we returned a couple hours later to find all our personal items on the floor, and our mattresses leaning in the hallway outside our rooms with ALL the doors in the entire hallway WIDE OPEN!! Apparently, they had received a new shipment of mattresses, and were changing out the mattresses in all the guest rooms. We were very concerned that we were not notified this was going to happen, and upset that our rooms were entered, our personal items moved and re-arranged, and our room doors left wide open--especially when we had specifically left signs up requesting that our rooms not be disturbed. The staff and management could not seem to understand our concerns.

We had 2 rooms that connected -- a double with a small kitchen and a king with a microwave and mini-fridge. Would have liked to have been able to watch some movies on demand but no option for that. Bathroom was clean....dated but no mold or anything like that. The kitchen is tiny with no counter space whatsoever but it functioned as a great option for breakfast and lunch. The pool area is actually very nice. Much nicer than the overall hotel. And you can't beat the view of the ocean/beach.

The sand here is hard packed with cars allowed to drive on it, and walking out into the ocean, there is NO drop off just a gradual slow drop. We stayed this time with family including our two grandkids. I asked for and got a room on a high floor to limit the noise from other guests. There was a family reunion in the hotel with many kids and they were a bit noisey on the lower floors. The view from all the rooms is wonderful, the pool is clean and the hot tub, in this case was not working, but was open and clean. The cord to run the jets was broken. I asked Eddie at the front desk for a dinner suggestion and he suggested \"Our Deck, Down Under\" less than a mile away, but not walking distance. It is a local seafood place, very popular and for good reason. The food was good, large portions and reasonably priced. It was located on the inner coastal, so it had a water view as well.

There is a Bob Evans restaurant on your way back out to I-95, about 10 minutes away for breakfast or a good comfort food dinner . . . .There is also a miniture golf course across the street from this hotel if you need to amuse the kids . . .", "Date": "June 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cFine hotel, recommended\u201d", "Author": "DutchDerk", "ReviewID": "UR30516850", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel on a very wet and windy day in May 2009.

The AAA rate was 71.00 a night for an oceanfront room with a full kitchen and two double beds. Parking is located in the lot in front of the hotel or there is a parking garage located underground. Parking was easy and free. The hotel has mostly oceanfront rooms and a few on the north and south sides of the building which are oceanview. The room we had was on the 2nd floor which is at lobby level. The room was very clean and only the signs of typical beach type wear on the furnishings. The bath was a bit small, however the water pressure and lighting in the bath were fine. The room had a small kitchen with a full size refridgerator, microwave, small 4 burner stove with oven. The fridge was great with keeping everything cold when we loaded it with drinks. The beds were a bit soft for our liking, but the sheets and pillows were nice. There was a small table with two chairs and plenty of lighting throughout the room. The sliding glass door opened to our oceanfront balcony. The balcony was private, contained two chairs and a small table. The pool deck was huge with plenty of lounge chairs, tables with chairs and umbrellas. The pool is quite small for the size of the pool deck. The pool was very warm, nice for cooler days, I hope it cools off for summer! There is also a small hot tub. The pool itselt gets shade from the building in the afternoons, there is an area that is not blocking the sun for afternoon sunbathers. The beach is only steps away from the pool deck and there is a hose to spray off unwanted sand. They provide limited beach chairs to take to the beach. There is also a beach vender selling food and renting umbrellas, lounge chairs, boogie boards etc, located very close to the hotel's beach access. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel for a no frills get away or family vacation. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful from the front desk to the housekeeping. It would be even better if the hotel replaced the mattresses and updated to duvets that many hotels now have. Also provide a few more items for the kitchen such as ice trays, a pitcher and some plastic tumblers for larger drinks. Finally the location is in Daytona Beach Shores near the Port Orange bridge. There are places to eat, shopping and grocery stores close by.
