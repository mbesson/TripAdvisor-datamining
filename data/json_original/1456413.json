Staying in a hotel is by choice to relax (we have a big house up in Tibidabo). We stayed once as a romantic wend just my husband and myself (I am pregnant now),the 2nd time with our 2 kids as well (14+3y.o). Both times we had exactly what we were looking for - relax, even with kids! Hotel is just excellent!Everything is perfect BUT especially the people! I would like to thank everybody who works there and makes it special and adds a nice touch! People actually remember our names and the names of our kids! We had cookies sent to our room and ducks for our younger son to have in the tub and his name (LUKE) made out of letters in the shower! We loved it and so did our kids! Room service is SUPER! I've traveled a lot and stayed in really nice places and would like to say that the room service food is usually at best ok. Probably, most of you will agree. Here, the selection is nice and the quality is great! The breakfast is very nice with a proper selection of everything (including dim sum),lots of fruits,etc, of course! Great location, needless to say! Still, for us what made it special were the people.

This was my first stay at a Mandarin Oriental, and it far exceded by expectations. I really cannot say enough good things about it. Service was impeccable at all times. The location was perfect with upscale shops very nearby, more moderate shopping one block over, two Gaudi buildings within a 3 minute walk (one was across the street and viewable from our room), and of course a doorman was always there to give us directions, greet us, and help us with a cab. We never actually had to wait for a cab because there were always several right there in front of the hotel. It was rainy when we were there and the doorman provided both myself and my fiance with umbrellas for our sightseeing. Front desk staff provided a map and all spoke excellent English. In fact, every single member of the staff spoke excellent English (this was not the case when we stayed in Valencia and Paris at different hotels) so we really appreciated it here. The room was beautiful, although a bit smaller than American hotel rooms. Every single thing I could possibly have wanted was already in the room ~ little things like bath salts, a bookmark, a magazine with an article on the Michelin starred restaurant in the hotel, electrical outlet adaptors, Ionic blow dryer (important if you are female), a remote control for the black out shade, champagne/white wine/red wine glasses, two different sizes of slippers, just anything and everything one could need or want was already there. The bed was very comfortable and the windows eliminated all outside noise. We were on the sixth floor and heard absolutely zero street noise (vastly different from New York City where I stayed in a hotel on the 31st floor of Le Parker Meridien and was kept awake by street noise). The black out shade was so effective and the room so quiet that I inadvertently slept until 1 in the afternoon. You must check out the Banker's Bar ~ it doesn't have bartenders, it has mixologists. The cocktails were innovative and contained the freshest ingredients. The hotel was once a bank and the bar contains safety deposit boxes on the walls (and ceiling). There was also a lovely patio outside, but it was rainy so we didn't have the opportunity to enjoy that. We also had dinner in the hotel and spent 4 hours in the spa. I will review those as well. In summary, it is going to be very difficult for me to stay at any other hotel now. I am fairly sure they will have a difficult time measuring up to this one. Absolutely the pinnacle of excellence in all areas.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cSimply marvelous!\u201d", "Author": "Trendspott", "ReviewID": "UR126163530", "Content": "This is my second trip to Barcelona. MO Barcelona remains one of my favorite city hotels. Staff are professional and friendly. The hotel also cannot be in a better location. Last time I didn\u2019t get to try out their Michelin restaurant because it was closed for a Summer break, but this time I finally dined at MOments. MOments serve modern Catalan cuisine and we tried their tasting menu. Chef Ra\u00fcl Balam is very creative, with a strong respect for each ingredient\u2019s original taste. His team picks the season\u2019s finest and freshest, and create dishes with a modern twist to the authentic Catalan flavors. Presentation is also a key element here, as each dish is presented like a piece of art. The 2 Spanish wines which the Sommelier picked were both excellent and complimented perfectly to our meal. The next day, I went to the Spa and had two of their \u201cstar\u201d treatments (offered only in very few places); the Bastien pedicure and the Linda Meredith Haute Couture facial (I was told the LM facial is a favorite of Kate Moss, Gwyneth Paltrow, Madonna and Jude Law)!!!! The Bastien pedicure is exactly what I needed after much walking in the city. The leg massage soothed my tired feet and the pedicure gave my toe nails a nice clean natural shin (perfect as I especially prefer no nail coloring when travelling). Then the Linda M facial therapist analysed my skin (my face was calling for S.O.S. after much flying), and gave me a deep (non-harsh) cleansing and deep hydration facial \u2013 a much needed water plumping to my dehydrated skin. Going back to our Suite, it is sunset time, and our Butler has already arranged my favorite cocktail (Banker\u2019s bar signature ginger martini) for our enjoyment at the balcony!

The Concierge was EXTREMELY helpful to prepare for our trip with dinner reservations and a Barcelona FC match. They were very good. The restaurant is wonderful. Lunch was wonderful and breakfast was very good - expensive, but worth the cost. The gym does not have a ton of options, but it is VERY clean and spacious. My two gripes - the room was not ready and room size. When you get off a flight from NYC, you want to take a shower. I had reserved 2 rooms and neither was ready because a cruise was leaving from hotel. They tried to work with me, but then said it would be 30 minutes. It ended up being over one hour. That is unacceptable, particularly because we reserved a pickup at the airport through the hotel. They know when we were arriving. This is a pet peeve of mine. If you are prepared and happy to go out once you get there, then ignore the negative comment. The room was very nicely appointed. It is very high tech - offer convertors etc. It is VERY modern. The shower was a bit weird for me on wood planks, odd shower head, and handle shower thing. There really is not much room at all and the bed is very low to the ground. It was very nice, but not my style. If it is yours, you will love it. They have a great patio for cigars and tapas above the lobby - very nice. You can also smoke tight outside bar banc in the hotel. Very nice drinks there. Overall, it is a very good hotel in a great location. If you like modern hotels and don't mind the room being a bit small, then this is great.

It opened two years ago and is in a converted bank building that has been completely remodeled by one of the country's leading designers. Every inch is beautifully and sleekly designed; however, even the deluxe terrace room is a bit small. We chose the hotel because we heard it had the best concierge desk in the city. We are not good about planning vacations, so we make heavy use of concierge services. With the guidance of the concierge team we had six perfect days and nights on our first trip to BCN. Because we booked through AmEx Platinum, breakfast at Blac each morning was included. It was a great was to start the day (but I might have felt otherwise if I'd been paying an additional 38 euros per person). The complimentary afternoon tea was also nice (but would have disappointed at the usual price). As mentioned in other reviews, there still seems to be an attempt to charge business travelers for wi-fi, but not casual tourist users. There are some other quirky policies like this (eg, a 4 euro supplement for a skewer with 4 strawberries at tea), which make you wonder about hotel management. The rooms seemed quite fully priced for the market, so one wonders about other nibbling. Beware of the charge for cocktails on the roof (Two vodka and grapefruit juice clocked in at 50 euros, setting a new personal high for per drink charges). The fitness center is included without a supplemental charge and the steam room are quite nice, even though the gym is small and barely has what you need for a workout.

YES, they have very good service and lots of staff but after that???? not much. This hotel CANNOT be compared to HKG, Bangkok,NY, London or Tokyo. It's location is in the center of Barcelona and on the main street. When we went looking for those little small \"finds\" Restaurants we like, we always ended up walking far away from the hotel which is really just a few blocks north of the touristy Ramblas. This location is good and far more central then the Ritz or the W however still just misses being on a 6 lane main road. The Lobby, Bars and restaurants were fabulous form little function. Sprayers in the hallways kept the scent of the hotel everywhere. Our room was TINY with a large bathroom..This is really ridiculous as they built a huge atrium which could have been made smaller to give you more space in room, however they totally went for design..a poor choice in my opinion. We had beautiful side lamps but the white bed and side tables are already showing many dings and dents and the room seemed claustrophobic, narrow. This was the first time with this chain that I felt we paid for something we did not receive. More a name \"Mandarin\" and less product. Prices for food and drink were standard Mandarin pricing, very highly priced,but good quality. This hotel had a colorful group of people staying there. From Old Americans with lots of plastic surgery to Arabs with tons of kids everywhere. Then there were people from Germany and France and Japan and China....a real interesting mix. Except for the unruly kids we enjoyed the people watching over drinks or just sitting in the lobby. The feel of this hotel for us was just \"cold\" which was strange as we love modern? If you want to tell your friends you stayed at the Mandarin and take fashion photographs....this is your hotel. Otherwise, in this range, this hotel doesn't measure up to much of the competition. Will they remember your pillow favourites when you return...yes! Can your room feel like a coffin....Yes! This hotel is not a value hotel....it is a luxury chain and I felt they did a poor job from the design to execution. Barcelona is a fabulous city with many fabulous choices!

Mandarin Oriental's unrivalled location on Barcelona's leading shopping highstreet Passeig de Gracia also comes with a major challenge and that is the structure of the building, formerly a bank. Most of the room categories are quite small for Mandarin Oriental standards (most international Mandarin hotels have minimum 40 sqm) but are fairly large for Barcelona hotels in historical buildings. Two years from opening, rooms have been very well kept, all looking perfectly clean and fresh. I was hoping an improvement on the desks would be made - they are very small and hardly fit a laptop. The highest room category, the Mandarin Terrace rooms are the best ! - largest of all room types, with a generous sitting area and a large balconyUnfortunately, this type was not available during my current stay. The only unpleasant surprise was the SPA, where I found the same disturbing sewage smell through all the facilities, which I reported two years ago. I was told by a SPA receptionist they themselves report the issue constantly, but apparently nothing has been done to fix it, yet.

We had a garden view room which overlooked the local school's basketball courts and unless you were REALLY serious about siesta, then this made no impact on the tranquility of the room at night. The room was fashionable, as is expected of MO, with a very modern style shower. The lighting is completely adaptable to personal needs at night, and the electronic curtains are light proof for the day. The lampshade would be right at home in a designer warehouse. Pillow menus will make anyone feel at home. Room turn down nightly by the room service staff, who make up for their lack of english, by their beaming smiles and the pride they take in their work. The flatscreen TV was good quality, but the signal frequently dropped out and that needs some attention. The movie selection is also slightly outdated. The bed was comfortable enough, but users of plush matresses will find it not quite as good as would be expected of a hotel of this calibre. The other thing missing is free WiFi, which you would expect when you are paying this much. By far the best breakfasts in a 3 week trip were eaten in the hotel's Blanc restaurant. Although sparse in terms of variety both in terms of day to day, and in terms of overall choice, the quality of the food is second to none. The restaurant staff also remembered our name by sight which was a pleasant surprise. Blanc restaurant for dinner is also very good, but I expected more. The food was above average, but if you are looking to have your socks blown off, then maybe look at Moments restaurant.

We went there every morning at 6am, and sometimes before (jet lag), and had the place to ourselves. But I can imagine that during the day, it could get quite packed. The rooftop dipping pool was undergoing renovations when we were there, so that was a huge disappointment. The location is not right in the middle of the city, but not far, which is what we wanted. The location is smack in the middle of the most magical street in barcelona, Passeig de Gracia where you will find the famous Casa Batllo almost directly opposite the hotel and La Pedrera is only 10 mins walk. The street is dotted with Gaudi features, and you only need to walk out the front door to experience the magic.

Booked a Terrace Suite for a daily rate of 2.900 euro, expecting obviously a perfect stay. It's a design hotel but unfortunately the designer who did it totally lacked practical sense. The suite is made by a living room and a bedroom which are not separated by concrete walls but by glass, so that if your wife sleeps in the bedroom and you decide to stay in the living room, it will be impossible for her to sleep because the light will pass from one room to the other. The room, the wardrobe and the bathroom are full of sensors, so that if you wake up in the night from the bed, the light in the wardrobe will suddenly switch on therefore waking up also the other person. On top of that we had huge problems during our stay which made impossible to sleep : the light in the second bathroom kept on switching on and off by itself all the night long and the hotel maintenance was not able to fix it. Moreover, the electric curtains in the bedroom suddenly went up early in the morning whilst we were sleeping. The hotel maintenance \"discovered\" that it was due to the fact that an hotel guest staying in a room below our could open not only his but also our electric curtains with his remote control.

It was our last stop of a 2 week Spain trip and it couldn't have ended any better. Great location on Passeig de Gracia. Beautiful hotel, clean and spacious rooms, attentive and caring staff. We booked the room through Am Ex fine hotels and resorts which included daily breakfast, an afternoon tea, and late checkout. When checking in, the receptionist noticed my birthday on my passport and realized I would be actually having my birthday during my stay there. The first evening in our room they sent up a bottle of sparkling wine to say happy birthday and they sent up a chocolate cake the second night with happy birthday written on it. Very nice touch! The neighborhood directly around the hotel is really nice. You can spend several days walking all the nearby streets with their shops, restaurants, and cafe's. Easy access to the subway is a plus too. Only a 5 - 10 minute walk from Las Ramblas. The only real complaint would have to be that in room wifi internet access is an extra charge. For a 400+ euro/nt room starting, it should really be included. Every employee at the hotel treated us very friendly and with our needs being their most important concern.

Room service was excellent, great wines at very reasonable prices. I would be raving about the hotel if not for one detail which, although fairly small, speaks volumes about the real commitment to service: One night we were leaving the hotel and it was raining really hard, pouring is more like it; the hotel always provides umbrellas for guests of course, we had taken one during the day and returned it when coming back. I asked for an umbrella and they told me they were freshly out of them, there was no way we could walk without an umbrella so I insisted and they said no more umbrellas. I went to the front desk to ask for help getting one and they told me sorry but they ran out of them, I was a bit incredulous and insisted, asking if there was not one more umbrella in the whole place and they said no. So I called our friends to pick us up, and while waiting for them, five minutes later, they got some more umbrellas out of storage. I was really annoyed, because I specifically had asked if there had no more, even in storage and they said no. This shows that they really don't care for the guests, so even though the place is great and I would return, Mandarin Oriental still has a long way to go until they can compete with Four Seasons on service.

(We recently stayed at a Mandarin Oriental in Miami, and was very impressed with how new and well maintained the hotel was). The carpeting is beginning to look a little ragged and the furniture in our room had many nicks and dings. It wasn't that obvious, but noticeable enough to me. The shower was beautiful and unique in design, and the bath amenities were wonderful. Like many European hotels, there isn't much room to navigate. If you are looking for spacious, this is not it. The lobby is extremely small, and seems a bit oppressive. I felt a little cramped waiting in there for my room to be ready.

Hotel is relatively small, with only 98 rooms and is hidden behind some boring facade of an old bank which could not be reconstructed due to its historical value. Anyhow, inside the hotel, nothing is boring :-). Hotel has very nice bar called, Bankers Bar, with old deposit boxes still inside the walls, has two very nice inside restaurants and one outside bar/restaurant (with beautiful garden). We were accommodated in Deluxe Boulevard room (facing Passeig de Gracia) which was very nice (but a little bit small for deluxe hotel/room) and quite. Room was equipped with everything that you need (and don\u2019t need), beside TV and DVD it had all possible cables so that you can connect any piece of hi tech device that you might have with TV. We loved roof top pool which, even with only 50cm of dept, provided to us excellent opportunity for chilling out, getting some color and gave nice view on the city.

The hotel itself is smaller than anticipated, with no real lounge to speak of. The staff were courteous upon arrival and throughout our stay. We received complimentary drinks at the hotel bar before being checked into our room. And then the surprises began. We waited 30 minutes for our suitcase to be brought up - which after a long trip and at that late hour was quite unpleasant - and discovered that we could not connect to the internet from our room without some sort of password because their system of logging in with your name and room number wasn't working. Thankfully, a staff member helped us retrieve a password and the first 24 hours of wireless internet connectivity were on the house. Up to this point, it had been our understanding that the internet in the rooms was free. We were told it was only free in the lounge, which is, as previously mentioned, the small area between the concierge's desk and reception, with four couches and completely in the way of anyone coming in. Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was poor quality. The tomato and olive bread was soggy and stale, the croissants were a day old and the price was exorbitant. We made the mistake of taking breakfast in our room on the second day and the price for a continental breakfast for one person came up to 60 euros! Lunch on their terrace is the only redeeming quality of their restaurant service. The tapas were excellent and we were lucky to be there on a Sunday so that kids playing games on the immediately adjacent basketball/football court next door did not bother us - as we noticed on our last day that they were so loud we could hear them in our room, with the windows closed. It is undeniable that the rooms are trendy and fashionable and done up to a high standard. The decor is clever and modern and the room was very much to our tastes. However, the bathroom doesn't allow for much privacy as the sliding tinted glass doors do not close fully. On the other hand, the array of toiletries offered was very good. All in all, the hotel offers an interesting location, within walking distance of Las Ramblas and many Gaudi sights, but the high price of the rooms does not justify all the additional high costs that pop up as one makes uses of services which one might have presumed to be complimentary.", "Date": "May 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, amazing attention to detail, very small rooms\u201d", "Author": "JDTRAVELBrighton", "ReviewID": "UR64291678", "Content": "The hotel location is wonderful as is the rooftop dippiong pool area, BUT it is the only place really other than the bar or restaurant where you can sit, so if the weatgher is bad, and it was when we were there, you are really stuck in your bedroom, which is small.
