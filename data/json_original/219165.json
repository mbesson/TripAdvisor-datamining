We are middle age and have travelled to Cancun/Maya Riviera 6 times, Puerto Vallarta 3 times, Huatulco once, Dominican 5 times and have travelled the U.S. and Canada extensively. We've stayed at all inclusive 3 star to Palaces. In our opinion the RIU Playacar is at least a 4 star property. We stayed in building 3 on the 3rd floor. There was a full king size bed. The bathroom had a full bathtub/shower. The bathroom was separated by a door not the curtains you see in some pictures. Closet was huge and included the safe box, mini fridge and liquor dispensor. The balcony was secluded by a 3.5 foot wall, very quiet! The room was updated, clean and spacious. The king bed was firm. We asked for a foam pad which was installed within an hour. It made a very nice difference. Building 3 was super quiet and smack dab in the middle of the property. The main buffet is adjacent to the lobby. This buffet is one of, if not the best we've ever attended. There is a huge variety of food for breakfast and supper. There is a theme supper but does not diminsh the amount or variety. This buffet closes at 10:30. The buffet (Turquesa) near the pools opens for continental breakfast at 10:30 then serves as a lunch buffet. Again, a wide selection of food. Not as big as the lobby buffet. The Turquesa turns into the al a cartes for supper. 1/2 is the Mexican, 1/2 is the steakhouse. The Japanese is a separate restaurent in the lobby. We ate at all 3. The Japanese is buffet style. Lots of food and specific to Japanese cooking. The steakhouse and Mexican were served at your table. All 3 were very good. Making reservations was easy. At 7am in the main buffet, in the middle of the buffet a gentlemen took your room number, number of guests and what time you want service: 6:45 or 8:45. No mad rush for this, lots of spots available. There are 3 bars. Lobby, pool and theater. Lobby abd pool open at 10am, Pool closes at 5:30. Theater opens at noon til midnight. The pool area fills up in the mornings, however there was not a mad rush for loungers. The beach area is huge! There were so many loungers available at all times of the day. The animation team works very hard at the pool area. Lots of music and activities. There is a second pool adjacent without a bar and is a little more secluded and quiet. The beach was very quiet, just your normal volleyball and people watching. Water is magnificent to swim in. The best spot to go in is directly in front of the life guard tower. We went to the RIU Yucatan beach. Wow, a lot more people and crowded. The folks from RIU Tequila use this beach. The RIU Lupita has an area at the RIU Palace. So the Playacar did not have any additional pressure. You can visit the Yucatan and Tequila. So we did just that. The pools are nice but busy. In the evening it was fun to entertain at both bars. The Tequila's bar is at the theater. It's a blast. There is a sports bar there too with snacks in a fridge. Pool will cost you 30 pesos. We can tell you this is an amazing hotel with access to 2 others. The hotel staff are so nice, firiendly and attentive. Their English language was very good. We will return to this property, soon!", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester Hills, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cCounterfeit Cigars\u201d", "Author": "kerry p", "ReviewID": "UR126056670", "Content": "Vactioned at this resort with family on Christmas, 2011.

Great Value, and we were highly impressed. Staff-Awesome! They will get you whatever you want, whenever you want and are very happy, friendly. The anamacion team does an excellent job with activities by the pool and on the beach (dance, water aerobics, stretching, trivia questions, beer drinking contest =) This stuff goes on by the pool bar, but there is also a quiet pool for people looking for more relaxation. Maria, Karla, Oscar from anamacion team were excellent. Enrique at the pool bar does a great job and very friendly. Rooms- Very nice and clean. towel creations are left for you every day. we tip our room cleaners because they did an excellent job. Get a room in bldg 3 or 4 so you are in the middle (close to the beach, and close to the lobby/breakfast/supper buffet) and they are more quiet as well. And yes, the beds are firm, but nothing is going to be as good as your bed at home-ask for a mattress topper if you think you'll need it-we did and slept well each night) Also, the grounds are kept very clean. You will always see the grounskeepers cleaning, trimming, raking, ect so everything is in good shape. Food- Great Selection! Compared to other AI's we have been to, this resort by far, had the best food and best selection around. The restaurants do a wonderful job presenting with ice sculptures, and carvings/creations of food-presenation was amazing! Also, my mom is gluten-free, and she had no problems finding enough different foods to eat throughout the week. This resort also allows access to a few sister-resorts, all within walking distance of Riu Playacar. Taxi's to town are $7 from the front of the hotel, about a 5 minute ride. This hotel is very nice, and small enough so you get to know people and meet friends, but big enough where you will meet someone new every day, and it offers great selection of food and fun for everyone.

Food was very good, in fact I don't think I ever had the same thing twice, except if I really wanted to. Plenty of choice and well presented. The pool and surrounds were ideal for lapping up the sun. The staff were all great and couldn't do enough to keep you happy, but not at all \"over the top\". Beach was great and even though the hotel was full there were plenty of sun beds for everyone. Downsides ?? none really !! Just remember, if you want 5 star luxury then pay loads more, this is not 5 star but very good value for money. Only complaint was that the housekeeping staff were not security concious. I asked at reception on four occasions for the cleaners to lock the balcony door, as we were on the ground floor at the rear of the hotel overlooking the garden and could have been vulnerable.

The cleaning staff is outstanding and helpful as all the staff were there are a couple of nice pools one of which is quiet and the other has a swim-up bar and social activities. there is nightly entertainment which is lame but fun at the same time.

There was a quite a variety of food at the various buffets and there is something for everyone with lots of fruit and fresh salad and different themes (Mexican, Asian etc) depending which night it was. At the bars you can ask for better quality drinks but there did not appear to be any high end liquors and drinks such as Pina Coladas or Margaritas were made from mixes which taste somewhat artificial and sugary. No serious nightlife at this hotel with only a small lobby bar open till the wee hours, better bet is the neighboring sister hotel Riu Tequila which has a big outdoor bar area open til midnight which then moves to the adjoining disco which open until 2:00 am. The Riu Playacar is well located easy driving distance to all local attractions and a 15 -20 minute walk to the town of Playa del Carmen and the Cozumel Ferry. There is a small mall across from the hotel with a rental car service and the neighborhood itself is in a gated community which feels very safe.

Our front desk person, Vero, was the best. Everytime we stopped by the desk she was always smiling and willing to help us. Our rooms were a bit outdated but there were always clean and comfortable with the exception of the hard bed. We had not ocean view but we did not mind since we spent our days in the beach.

There is one main buffet restaurant in the main building building that is used for breakfast and dinner. The restaurant area by the pool/beach is used primarly for lunch and snacks. The food was always good and had a good selection. The coffee was terrible. The bartenders and servers were always friendly through the faciltiy. There is only one beer Dos Equix and the top liquor is Jimador tequila. everything else is generic liquor. We drank lots of Jimador which is a pretty good tequila for the money. We used the car rental on site to plan a trip to Cancun and tulum which costed us about 70 USD. The roads are great now adays. I had no problems. The Riu has five other hotels in the area. If you stay at the regular RIUs you can visit Playacar, Tequila, Lupita, Yucatan. For two days we were upgraded to the RIU Palace and the main difference are the physical facilties.

We are a low key couple from Canada - 37 and 44. The purpose of our trip was some sun and R&R. We enjoy food but are not picky, we like to chill on the beach, walk the beach, and swim in the ocean. We are not big shoppers but I do enjoy the art of the haggle! We don't party at the disco every night, but like a little night life. We have been to Mexico several times in the past and this is the best location for us. It's close to the beach, very safe in the area of Playacar, walk to Playa-del-Carmen in 30 minutes and its not far from the marina for fishing and golf course. What we loved about the Riu Playacar was: ** our Sunwing Rep Alex*** (1) Location (2) Staff / Service (3) value(we paid 2400 all in for 7 days including flights - so I guess that is about $1400 for the week for the hotel) (5) Food - the buffet was really the best, the a la cart restaurants were ok (6) access to other Rui resorts in Playacar. (7) Rooms - decent, clean and comfortable (8) Spa (9) Shops (10) Activities. Areas that need improvement at the Riu Playacar are: (1) Smokers - they can smoke anywhere. i'm a non-smoker but tolerant of those who smoke but not while i'm eating. Grossed me out at times. (2) Beds - they are hard, i know this is common in resorts but I think these were a bit worse than other places i've stayed. (3) Entertainment - don't expect much from your night time shows. they are great dancers but I can't watch that every night. (4) Stray / Wild Cats - we are not cat haters, but it was a bit much with the strays around at night while eating outside on the patio. Tips for other travelers: - ask for a room in Building 5 or 6 if you want to be close to the pool and beach - but note if you're one to go to bed before 11 don't have your balcony door open. Facing into the pathways is nicer, but the outside rooms are not bad. - Take a walk to the other Riu resorts they are a great way to change up the scenery and see what they have to offer. - Take in a massage or body wrap at the SPA - great value and very great staff. The staff were amazing, I can't say enough about the servers, bar tenders and front desk staff. We were treated very well and everyone had a smile! Over all this was a great trip and we will go back when we need some more R&R. I have to add that I spoke with a lot of people while on this trip and some were disappointed by the food and lack of a la cart restaurants. If that's what is important to you try the sister property, Riu Palace, its notch above and will give you the \"fancy\" you want.

It was not a 5 star resort (but maybe classed as one because you can visit some of the other Riu resort pools and restaurants). But we still had a great two week vacation and for the price we paid we would do it again no problem. Ended up being $2,300 a person all taxes in from Calgary mid January for two weeks. The staff was friendly and always smiling, we loved the food! in the buffets but hated the a la carte dinners - we tried the Grill (rib steak) and Mexican (I was hoping for much better here and was surprised). You need to sync up with the restaurant times. If you miss breakfast from 7a-10:30am then there is a continental buffet available from 10:30a-noon. Some people were upset they had to wait until noon to strap on the feedbag - but it suited us just fine to have some fruit and light breakfast - then we would just come back again in a few hours and have some lunch too if we were still hungry :-) Lunch is noon-4pm when they bring out more items besides snack food. From 4-6:30pm is only snack food again until the dinner buffet is opened. There is lots of variety - and every day I thought I would limit myself to only having a few items and try the rest another time - but it was hard and I always ended up overeating. I love the skinny tender porkchops, the salsa fresca and the guacomole! We thought the house red wine was very good for house wine and enjoyed it every night with dinner. The staff works very hard at the restaurants. We had a room in Bldg 3 on the main level - was loud because other guests have no respect for being quiet. Also you can hear the person above you \"clicking\" around all night in high heels. Yes the mattress was very hard but we still slept good. Our room was clean and the towel animals were fun. The shower had plenty of hot water - although can be a bit dark in there! Yes the TVs are tiny but we did find English channels to watch and kept up to date on the news from around the world when we wanted to - even found a few good shows to watch on the couple of nights it rained and we just wanted to stay in and relax. Some of the commercials are in Spanish but the shows were in English on some of the channels. We didn't like any of the liquor in the room dispenser, (but the beers and the water were good) but found a few favorite drinks at the bars/lounges on site - try the Russo Blanco and the Mariachi! We found the drinks strong and the bartenders friendly at all of the bars/lounges. We hung out at the Lobby bar and made lots of new friends and thanks to Alberto and Ramos our bartenders who were lots of fun! We never had a problem finding a lounger poolside or beachside, and lots of umbrellas and shade the majority of the time - but we did notice during our second week it was quite a bit more filled up than our first week (we went the last two weeks in January). I think a lot of guests from the other Riu resorts come and hang out at the Playacar because it is beachside. We had fun playing ping pong and taking some water aerobics and rhumba dancing poolside. We liked the location - you can walk into Playa but we always cabbed it for $7 each way. They have great shopping at the shopping plaza right across from the resort - could find pretty much everything you can find on 5th avenue in Playa - without as much hassle and calling to you so that was nice as we find that gets tiring in a short amount of time. We went on one tour to Coba booked through our Signature rep - and had a great time climbing the pyramid. We took the ferry into Cozumel on our own one day - in hindsight we should have rented a driver for the day and toured the island as it was kind of a carbon copy of hanging around on 5th avenue - but it was still fun to go look and eat and drink :-) Most of the two weeks we just de-stressed, hung out, ate, drank, relaxed and just had a great time. I'll save my review of it not being a 5-star for Signature Vacations - as they were the ones who billed and sold it as that . . . but as far as the resort goes we had an excellent time! and don't regret if for a second - go have fun and be on holidays!", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cService excellent...hotel wonderful....beds very hard though...\u201d", "Author": "kleinehn_mom", "ReviewID": "UR124581804", "Content": "We were there for a week and returned last week.

Also, as a vegetarian, I wished they had more options, but found it overall to be pretty accommodating (but why does all the mexican food have to have meat prepared into it? Can't I have a veggie fajita or cheese quesadilla?) As a side note, is chocolate not a common thing in mexico? As a professed chocoholic, let's just say I was in withdrawal. The beach was beautiful. It tended to get cloudy in the late afternoons, so I stuck to the mornings/midday for the best sun. Yes, the beds are hard, but after a long day on the beach I found we slept pretty well anyway (got some good advice to sleep on top of the blankets they give you in the closet, which helped a little too). Overall, my biggest complaint was that it wasn't closer to the town of Playa del Carmen. We were given misleading information from a travel agent that it was within walking distance, only to find it was nearly a half hour away on foot (10 mins in a cab).

It was our first trip to the Riviera Maya, and we were excited to go there, since we had been to Puerto Vallarta 3 times previously,and had heard so much about Playa Del Carmen, and the beautiful water, and sand on the beaches. We were not disappointed, and really enjoyed our trip. First of all, I would like to mention that the weather is very unpredictable on the Gulf of Mexico. We encountered this when we landed in Cancun, to pouring rain- we are talking -downpour! I have not seen rain like that -ever. The rain lasted all day, so that really scared me- we had never had any rain in Puerto Vallarta, and I was afraid it would ruin our trip, but I was wrong! Thankfully it was only one day, (we had no more rain after that) and it was a nice tropical rain- warm, and it definitely memorable. The resort had umbrellas in the room, which we could use, and the staff did their best to keep everyone's spirits up. When we arrived, they made us feel welcomed, and gave us a cocktail right away- reminding us frequently, to relax, we are on vacation. This resort is smaller than the Riu we had been to before, and much plainer, but having said that, it was nice to not have a ton of walking to do(everything is close together), and I felt like we got to know people better in this resort(and staff). It was always kept clean, and I liked the pool areas, and the beach was awesome. No complaints there, except the wind was a bit much at times. The food was really good as far as AI's are concerned. One day, however, we missed breakfast(due to a meeting with our sunwing rep), and were disappointed that it was over by 10:30 am, and they only had bread and fruit at the Turquesa. The service was hit and miss. Sometimes we had awesome servers, and other days, I couldn't even get their attention. Lots of choice, and always found something good. Loved the guacaomole, and salsa! We went to two of the ala cartes- the steak house, and the mexican. They were both good, but not great. I liked the steak one better- my husband really enjoyed the bbq ribs. My steak wasn't cooked enough- be sure to order it well done, if you don't like a red inside. The shows were great-esp the Michael Jackson, and Grease, Mayan, and Mariachi nights. Not a big fan of the Mr, and Mrs Riu shows- but lots of people enjoyed them. They only had one day where they served drinks by the pool, so expect to get your own drinks most of the time, and same thing at the nightly shows. The staff were very friendly though, and worked hard. Rooms were the same as the other Riu we had been to, and pretty basic. Asked for a bed crate, and it made a big difference! (yes, the mattresses are hard) Didn't get a towel animal unless we tipped, I was kinda surprised at that. Drinks in fridge were replenished once in the week while we were there, but we called the desk, and they brought us more when we ran out.(we drink alot of water) What more can I say?

The resort is a smaller resort consisting of 6 three story buildings. The rooms are good sized, although a little dated. The beds are hard (the same as all other Riu's) but if you ask for a mattress topper it will help. The TV was small, probably about 19\" and did not have the best picture, and not a lot of channels. Other than that the rooms were just fine, the shower was nice and large, with good water pressure, and plenty of hot water. The mini bar was re-stocked every other day, although if you requested it would be re-stocked more often. House keeping did an amazing job cleaning the rooms and even got all the sand off of the floor, tat I tracked in from the beach. The beach at the resort was one of the nicest that I have ever been to, it was nice and wide (about 100 yards/meters) from the entrance to the water. The upper portion of the beach was planted with palm trees, and offered plenty of loungers. We had drink service everyday on the beach, and a small tip to your server ensured his frequent return. The pool area was large, clean, and remarkably uncrowded. There were two large pools, one with a swim up bar, and one that seemed to be much more quiet. There were plenty of loungers around the pool, and lots of room to sit either in the sun or shade. A real nice touch was the waiters that came around to you, so you did not have to get up and walk to the bar if you wanted a drink. The animation team was one of the hardest working groups at the resort, they kept everyone who wanted to be involved in an activity involved, and left the others alone. The shows at night, while not Las Vegas caliber, were very good and certainly kept everyone entertained. After working all day, and putting on a show at night, the team took groups out to different clubs every night. The food at the resort, while not gourmet fare, was very good for an all inclusive resort, and offered a great deal of variety. I have stayed at a few other Riu resorts, and in my opinion the food was better here than it was at the other Riu's I stayed at. Even picky eaters can find something that they will like on the buffet. The Steak House and the Mexican restaurants were OK, nothing special, but a nice change, while the Japanese restaurant was a waste of time, with the food served buffet style. The grounds and common areas of the hotel were clean and well kept, we always saw someone cleaning or painting something. The bars were fun and lively, but not over the top, with a lot of rowdy out of control drunks. Drinks were good and the bartenders could make anything you asked for. A small tip would ensure that you got great service, and you choice of alcohol, be sure to ask for the better brand or you will get well liquor, which may not be the best. Overall I had a great stay, the staff was extremely helpful, very friendly, and very courteous, and would do almost anything you asked. I have heard a rumor that the hotel is going to be getting a remodel in the summer of 2012, if this is true it would transform the resort from very good to great.

Got a good deal from Winnipeg $1600 for 2 of us air,hotel, all incl & taxes. First time to Playacar area but 4th time to Playa. By far the best location , excellent beach, safe area, 20 min walk into town. Hotel was rated 5 star, but would only give it a solid 4. No real reason but for 5* I would expect new and top of the line. It wasn't real busy when we were there so eating was easy. You have to go down in the morning to reserve for the 3 sit downs. This may be an issue at a busy time unless your down there at 7 am. All 3 were good and ate at them all twice. Breakfast and lunch is your usual > lots of choices and always something for everyone. Not sure what some people complain about you don't get that kind of choice at home. Beach and Pool areas had lots of chairs and loungers. Drink service was slow so usually had to get up and get your own but still not a big deal. Small things like that would not give it the 5 star rating. Beach is nice sand and clear water. Easy walking up and down in both directions. Night life was the usual type of shows, so -so. They try hard and put on what they can. Not alot going on later at night if your looking to party should probably stay somewhere else. Across the street was one of the sister resorts that you have full access to and seemed more lively. They had a decent sports bar there so could go and watch your favourite game which was good. One of the other things that knocked it down from a 5* rating was in brochure they list a gym/spa. Actually it is down the street a block at another resort so had to walk down there to use the gym or have a sauna. Rooms were nice, sure bed was hard but try and find a hotel that has your bed at home at it. Nicely cleaned everyday , fridge restocked , towels changed > what more do you want. I used the dive shop to go on 2 scuba trips which was handy being able to leave right from the beach. Lots of choices of places to dive at , just a matter of picking your day and what you want to do.

The entertainment staff was fantastic. I know they were there 12 hrs a day, easy and they were just full of energy all the time. We really liked the food; so many choices and all very good. We only ate at one of the specialty restaurants (Steakhouse) which was very good but we were so happy with the regular menus, we just ate that. The wait staff was just great and they greeted us every time as if we were long time customers. The pools, beach and all facilities in general were kept so well (one morning as I was out walking around 6AM, there was a guy wiping down the lampposts in the walkways).

The room is basic no frills but was clean , as stated from other reviewers the bed is hard as a rock but after laying at the beach all day which is wonderful and drinking all day had no trouble falling asleep. The only trouble with our room was the TV. Only had 3 channels which where only in Spanish made several attempts with front reception but was not looked into , good thing weather was great and did not need the TV . Due to the fact that the resort was maybe half full had no issues with noise and no issues getting beach chairs and waiting at bars and reservation at the ala cartes. The food was great gained 5lbs the selection was fabulous, and presented beautiful. The ala cartes were all good our favorite was the Mexican least favorite was the Chinese the food was good but is not really an ala carte as is a buffet. The beach is amazing and clean lots of chairs, very little for boats, seadoos etc so very safe to swim and play in the ocean, water clean and clear with soft sand and no seaweed/grass. The location of this resort is great right across the street is a mall with Starbucks and plenty of shops selling trinkets to expensive jewellery to cowboy boots and everything in-between. You are also in a gated community with resorts, private houses and condos so we felt amazingly safe and comfortable walking around, we walked to 5th Ave Playa Del Carmen was very safe walked during day and also at night but for 70 peso a cab will take you there. Plenty of shopping to do, would recommend taking U.S currency along with pesos if you wish, we took only pesos and in some cases could have gotten a better deal if had U.S cash. We travelled with Sunwing all was great and have always had no problem with Sunwing but the rep (Jorge) was little to be desired, was never there on time and missed our welcome briefing, we have travelled with Sunwing and have always found the reps helpful and available but if Jorge is there and not one of the other reps just be prepared not see him on time. Overall was a great experience and would highly recommend this resort and would go back again, this was our first trip to Mexico and had a great time, we have traveled several times to Dominican Republic and to Cuba and now have a new favourite.

The hotel was ideal for us \u2013 it is smaller than the other Riu hotels in Playa del Carmen, but we were able to eat, drink and watch the entertainment at a couple of the others. The first night we had a room overlooking the \u201cforested area\u201d, but we asked to be changed to the inner section facing the little pathway through the middle of the hotel. Our room was quiet and very clean although we did have some musty smells on a few days (probably due to the rain on those days).

We walked along the beach into the town of Playa del Carmen a few times and walked back along the road. We also rented bikes every few days from the Riu Tequila and thoroughly enjoyed the cycle to and from town. The whole area of Playacar is very safe and we were happy that we chose the hotel within that area. If we had a complaint it was the vendors on 5th avenue, who were very pushy. However, the few vendors we encountered on our hotel beach were great \u2013 they didn\u2019t put any pressure to buy their goods. We visited Tuluum by a Collectivo from Playa del Carmen, a huge saving from the excursion tours. Tuluum was interesting, but an even better little spot we found were the ruins right in Playacar \u2013 no tourists, no big signs anywhere yet the much smaller area of ruins were every bit as good as those in Tuluum. We also visited Cozumel, which was a bit of a disappointment since it was Sunday and many of the shops were closed. If we ever go again we would rent a scooter to get around the island. We met lots of Europeans, Brits and Canadians \u2013 and had some interesting conversations and \u201cmimes\u201d in Spanish, Finnish, German, Russian and Swedish!

The food is excellent, even for the most pickiest eaters as there is a great variety of food. The hotel and grounds are spotless. The rooms are a bit dated and the beds are a bit hard, just ask for mattress mat, this adds to a more comfortable sleep. The TVs are very small and the reception is not the best (nice to watch a little TV before bed time), but not a deal breaker. The two pools are warm and clean, there was no problemo getting a lounge, same with the beach, spotless and the ocean was clear and the water warm, again no problemo getting a lounge and there is plenty of shade from the palm trees. The staff is warm and friendly and cannot do enough to help and serve you, the managers are always available and very accomadating. The town of Playcar was a twenty minute walk or a 70 peso ($7.00 US) taxi ride. Venders in town are a bit pushy but just say no thank you and move on, again no big deal. We rented a Jeep from Avis, just across from the Riu Playcar, talk nice and get the agent down in price, we got him down to $100.00 US, tax and insurance, you pay for the fuel.

I sat there after the last bottle finised for 5 hours untill my insurance paid the bill, the bill was over $2000.00 US.

I would give it a \"five\" but it seems that some people want to compare it to a Riu Palace, which it is not, and which is reflected in the price of the trip. Personally, I prefer the smaller size resorts so if you do as well, the Playacar is for you. The resort was spotlessly clean, the food was delicious (never have I consumed so many calories),the drinks were plentiful, the beach and water fabulous and the service outstanding. It was also very quiet at night, unlike the last place we stayed where you coudn't sleep because of noise from the disco. Our first room smelled quite musty, which seems unavoidable in such a climate. After a few days, we thought we would like a different room and that request was granted right away. The beds were firm but we found them to be very comfortable (and I do have a pillow top at home) plus the sheets were always so lovely and fresh and the rooms beautifully cleaned each day. The curtain between the bathroom and sleeping area was fabulous for extra private dressing space in the morning so I can't understand the complaints I have read about that feature. The resort is in a very safe area within a gated community. In fact we walked home from town at night alone and felt very comfortable doing so. A walk to town is twenty minutes and a half hour the other direction takes you to an undeveloped beach. These walks saved me from gaining ten pounds, I'm sure. I have been to many other areas in Mexico. This area differs in that you don't have many locals selling their wares on the beach. There was the odd one but usually he/she only had a handful of necklaces. Perhaps this changes as the busy season starts. One of the girls at the desk gave us the name of a bar \"Les Tabernaque\" (spelling??) on 1st Avenue where we watched the Grey Cup. Great little bar with a huge projection TV for any hockey fans Eight beer and nachos for $20.00 - a lot less tha you would pay on 5th Avenue. Claudia at the front desk can give you directions. We also went to the Riu Yucatan for a change of scene and a Spanish lesson. This resort is bigger and has a few more bars so might appeal more to younger adults.

Even though Riu Playacar was good, this hotel is a much lower quality than the upscale sibbling Riu Palace family. The Playacar complex involves 6 Hotels from the Riu group (plus other hotels from other brands); there are two Riu Palaces (to which you do not have access if staying at the lower class Riu sibling); and there are other three Riu Hotels of the same class as the Riu Playacar (do not take me wrong, they are all five star hotels, but cheaper than the Riu Palace). As a guest of Riu Playacar, you can use the facilities of the nearby The Riu Lupita, Riu Tequila and Riu Yucatan. Among all four, I belive the Riu Playacar is the best with direct beach at the hotel. Riu Playacar is probably smaller than the other three, just by the size of the dinning and show theater. This is an all inclusive hotel. Rooms were clean, staff was cordial and professional, decent food (not gourmet), two pools, great and large (wonderful) beach with palm trees, excelent shows at night (we liked the Michael Jackson, Vegas show, Maya show and Mariachi show). Beautiful landscaping. There is a golf course withing walking distance (hotel discount to $160 dlls or $136 dlls for early bird). What we did not like, quality and size of beds, all rooms have two full size beds and are supposley designed to hold four people, (better be four small people); beds are not too comfortable and have cheap mattresses, pillows and blankets are also very cheap; The hotel was booked with Aeromexico Gran Plan (air, hotel, transportation), maybe because of that, we got two adjacent rooms and the size of the beds was no longer an issue as it was good for one person each. (I was about to see if I could get another hotel because of the beds) The hotel should look to change to better quality queen beds rather. The hotel got very cheap with the shampoo, they give you two or three VERY SMALL pouches of shampoo - not even the typical small bottles. (my wife and daughter each used two pouches to shower) so I needed to request more every time. There is a mini bar that is replenish every two days, the three beers they have go fast, then you need to go to any of the bars for drinks. The hotel was mostly occupied by young adults and seniors, children and teens were rarely seen (perhaps due to the time of the year); so most activities were directed to adults. We had to create our own activities with our kids. We were very uncomfortable to see toppless ladies at the beach and around the pool, most of them were very very old senior ladies. We were told by hotel personnel that it is a common practice from European travelers. I think that practice should only be tolerated in adults-only hotels. As we respect the culture of other places, I believe visitors should also respect other cultures. The hotel should inform guests that being toppless is not customary in Mexico, specially in 'family' hotels.

Fantastic is about all one needs to say. Food was excellent, something for everyone in any combination. Drinks, what ever you wanted whenever you wanted it. Your wish is my command is the order of the day with the staff, certainly the friendliest I've ever seen. The beach and water are classic Yucatan, crystal blue water and wide sandy beaches. For a bonus, down town Playa del Carmen is a short ride (30 min walk) and is a great place to go shopping and have a beer with the locals. We took the ferry to Cozumel and a catamaran (Fury) to snorkel the reef. Very fun day trip but not for the faint of heart. The room was a little needy, in need of a little updating I think. A moldy smell persisted throughout our stay, there was a foul smell coming from the toilet occaisonally and the bed was a little hard. But, it certainly wasn't hard to sleep at night, because the days were exhausting, what with all that eating and drinking and beach walking and surfing and swimming and trips to Playa etc., etc., etc., etc. So a few glitches with the room were minor issues because we only slept and showered there. Overall 4 stars for this trip and this hotel.

We stayed at the RIU Playacar Nov6 - Nov13 and had a great time. This is a smaller resort with the ammenities of the larger ones but not the crowd. Mostly couples of all ages staying here, a few with young children. Both family and couple friendly. PRO's: The resort layout is great with smaller buildings lining a walkway that takes you to the pools and beach. The beach is fantastic with Palm trees providing shade instead of pallapas - much better. You can walk to four other RIU's and use their facilities; the hotel staff is extremely friendly and helpful - they work for a few dollars a day so tips are much appreciated; resort is extremely clean; food is very good and they change the buffet menu regularly - recommend going to the RIU Yucatan for lunch since they have a better selection. Location is great with a long beach to walk on and a developed area / road with sidewalks to safely walk along - even at night. The Playacar area is like a gated community which helps keep the area safe. CON's: I didn't realize how many people still smoke ... only place smoking is not permitted is inside at the one restaurant. All rooms have ashtrays, but I did not smell anything. Some rooms have two 3/4 beds touching side by side so we switched to a room with a king bed. Beds are very hard and the rooms only have a 19\" TV. Catamaran's, kayaks, etc. use is run by an outside company with a focus on making money - they limit you to one hour per day (which is not mentioned until you get there) and you may have to pay for a lesson first.

The beds were the worst though. Rock hard mattress wrapped in bed wetting protection plastic that was almost as loud as the neighbors when moving around in the middle of the night.

It is a lovely place, and I would recommend it. Check-in went very well. The front-desk staff spoke English very well and everything went smoothly. They gave us something to drink upon check-in. I don't know what it was, but it was delicious. The hotel itself is very nice and well-maintained. The rooms were very clean and fairly large and they all had balconies, though none faced the ocean. We were in building 4, which is in the middle of all the buildings. It was close to the beach and close to the restaurants and bars, which was nice. However, the buildings all have an open courtyard on the interior, which makes sound bounce around a lot whenever anyone is talking in the hallway. It made it a bit difficult to sleep late at night after the bars closed and early in the morning when the early birds were going to breakfast. Out biggest complaint about the room is the bed. The hardness didn't bother us, but the set-up did. The King bed was actually two full size beds pushed together, and each had its own set of sheets, blankets, etc. It made sleeping a bit awkward. The food was overall pretty good. The buffet had a ton of options, and the Mexican offerings, like barbacoa and conchita pibil, were amazing. The fresh salsas were great, too. There was so much variety that I don't understand how anyone could get bored or feel like they're eating the same thing every day. The steakhouse was also amazing - the tomato soup was arguably the best we've had. We weren't too crazy about the Mexican restaurant or the Asian restaurant, though, the tortilla soup at the Mexican restaurant was great. The beach was beautiful. Even though I'd heard that the water was extremely blue, I was completely blown away. Even when it was raining, it was as blue as I've ever seen water. Our only complaint about the beach is that the only shade available is from palm trees - there are no sun umbrellas. Despite SPF 50 and constantly keeping our chairs in the shade, we both got very burned. We also would have preferred a private beach, but we know that's extremely rare in the area and knew this hotel did not have a private beach when we booked. We also have to give major kudos to the entertainment team. They all work so very hard. I don't remember a single day where I didn't see Carla and a few others whose names I don't remember. We went to a few of the evening shows and they were really fun. We expected them to be rather cheesy, like at some of the other all-inclusives we've been to, but these were good - the ones we saw were choreographed dance shows. The dancers were very talented. Drinks were good. We didn't have problems with them being too weak or made with cheap liquor. The mango daquiris were really yummy. We didn't use the alcohol dispenser much, but we enjoyed being able to mix a cocktail in our room. Another general complaint is that smoking seemed to be allowed absolutely everywhere, including inside the restaurants. We expected to find a lot of smokers, and we expected smoking to be allowed most places, allowing smoking in the restaurants surprised us. It also rained all day the day we checked in, the next day, and most of the day after. We learned on our third day that they do have rain activities, but they did not make their \"in case of rain\" activities well publicized. Also, each room had an umbrella in it, which was really nice. Overall, we had an excellent vacation. We probably will not go back because we try to go different places each time we vacation, but if we found ourselves in Riviera Maya again, we would strongly consider staying here again.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat time at Alegro Playacar\u201d", "Author": "Ines I", "ReviewID": "UR119836607", "Content": "Just came back from a week stay, the first 3 days it rain (all day), but the rest of the week, when the sun came up we spend all days at the beach which is beautiful.

I think we had one of the best vacations so far in Mexico. The property is smaller than most, but that's a good thing. The resort is a little older, but impecable from the lobby to the rooms, the grounds and the staff. The staff is the friendliest staff we have encountered. We had so much fun with the entertainment staff, they were very friendly. Pablo, Maria, Ruben, Isra, Carla, Alexander and a few names I forgot. We played beach volleyball, water polo, water volleyball and of course crazy games at the pool every afternoon. The bartenders, Felix, Roberto Enrique and David, the bar manager, were great, they always had a smile for you and once they got to know you your drink was waitying for you. The pool bar was our favorite and we had a lot of fun there and meet a lot of nice people. We did not watch the theme shows, they are a little repititious when you have been to resorts as many times as we have, however, we enjoyed the live music in the lobby every night. We also had a lot of fun with the entertainment staff in the lobby in the early evening playing different games. One morning it rained for about 4 hours, the entertainment staff set up games and different things for us to participate in until the rain stopped. Maria gave us an excellent spanish lesson. I only wish I could remeber everything. I figure if I can learn five new words in spanish every time we go, I'm OK. One afternoon we had drinks in real coconuts. Playa Del Carmen is about a twenty minute walk from the resort or a five minute cab ride. We decided to walk to get a little exercize. We went late in the after noon and came back about eight. The sidewalks are well light and we always felt safe. On the way to Playa Del Carmen there are some small ruins you can see right off the sidewalk. There are some information plaques along the path telling you about the ruins. It.s small and there are two sets of ruins you can visit. The food was good, it needs to be mixed up a little. We had turkey one night that was excellent, Paella for lunch one day (our favorite) and an excellent buffet dinner with 3-4 different kinds of shrimp. pasta and great deserts. Luis Miguel and William went out of thier way to make you feel like old friends. The steakhouse was OK, since we are from the midwest you would have to go a long way to find a nice juicey steak like we have at home. The Jade (Aisan restaurant) was the best Aisan I have had a t a resort, The duck was fantastic as were the rest of the items on the menu. I had fried ice cream for the first time and loved it. We didn't eat a tthe Mexican restaurant, it was closed the night we wanted to go. Some of the reviews said the TV needs to be upgraded to a flat screen TV. I don't go on vacation or to Mexico to watch TV. The bed was a little hard for me, but I asked for a mattress topper and it was fine.

From the moment we arrived we fell in love with the hotel, in fact everything about the resort. The reception staff were extremly helpful when we checked in and so was the staff member who carried both our suitcases up three flights of stairs in one go. When we arived at the room, we found a clean, tidy and comfortable room along with a bear made out of towels!! The cleaning staff at the hotel did an excellent job and really do work very hard. When we went to the pool for the first time (and every other time) we found it to be clean and kept tidy. There was always sunbeds available which saved the hassle of having to compete with other holiday makers. The staff at the pool bar were friendly and always happy to help. The pool is literally like getting into a warm bath, its fab! One of the best things was that the hotel had its own section of beach which was literally a stones throw away from the pool area! It was just as we had seen in the brochure with pure soft white sand and clear warm turquoise sea! So picturesque! After reading previous reviews regarding the food we were apprehensive due to other people's negative comments. However we were delighted with the selection, quality and freshness of the food on offer at breakfast, lunch and dinner. My fiancee is quite a fussy eater but she always found something to eat. We were pleasantly surprised with the way the food was constantly being replenished. The restaurant staff, in particular Ricardo were fantastic! They were always on hand to clear used plates away and also keep our drinks topped up. One of the nicest things the hotel did for us was on my fiancee's birthday. The room cleaners decorated our room with balloons and later in the evening they brought us a bottle of sparkling wine and 2 glasses to celebrate her birthday. Overall we were very impressed and we really, really, really enjoyed our stay at the RIU Playacar and would not hesitate in recommending it to anybody! We both hope to return in the very near future!! It was perfect in every way! xx", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bartlesville, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "ToesInTheSand23", "ReviewID": "UR118982369", "Content": "We stayed at the Riu Playacar Sept. 25-Oct. 3. It's a smaller resort than some but that made it very nice. Did not have to fight to chairs by the beach. No palapas on the beach but a grove of palm trees which provided plenty of shade. You just have to move your chair around a lot if you want to stay in the shade. Very few Americans, many Europeans staying here. Large beautiful beach so we NEVER went to the pool, so I can not say how it was. The 2 pools (one activity pool and one quiet pool) had plenty of palapas for shade. Food at the resort was very good. Three restaurants + one buffet. The Steakhouse is open everynight. The Asian and Mexican Restaurants rotate on a nightly basis. Asian was probably our favorite. Be sure and ask for the fried ice-cream for dessert--Very good. Sushi was great. The other 2 were also very good. Fajitas were great at the Mexican. At the Steakhouse, I tried the Land and Sea KBob, with shrimp and steak. It was very good. I had a ribeye one night. It was good but just not the kind that we are used to. Food at the buffet, was also very good. We usually aren't much for buffets, but at there, twice and at each of the restaurants twice. We were in Room 3116--a ground floor room that faces the main walkway that runs between the front desk and the beach. There are 6 buildings. Our first room we were assigned was #1310. After looking at it and stepping out on the balcony, I went to the front desk and politely requested a different room. It was on 3rd floor of the backside of the first building closest to the frontdesk. Right next door to an extremely LOUD room (generator or something?) of the resort next door. Extremely loud. They were very gracious and gave me 2 keys to rooms to go check out and choose the one I wanted. I realize that if the resort was full they might not have given me this option but it worked out. I personally would also not want a room on the backside of buildings #1, #3, or #5. There is a pathway going down the area that is used as a service sort of walkway. Staff pushing carts of glassware, etc., makes it very noisy also. Building #5 is the closest to the theater so it might be a little loud when the show goes on at night (9:45 p.m.) No oceanview or poolview at the resort due to the way the rooms are situated unless the couple of suites on the ends of Buildings #5 & #6 have one but I wouldn't think you could see through all the trees. As stated previously, the beds are extremely hard. We did request the egg crate mattress pad but, to be honest, I don't know that it helped. Refrigerator in room kept stocked with Pepsi products, Dos Equis, club soda, orange soda and water. Above the mini bar, was a cabinet with bottles of rum, Vodka, tequila and something else that you could add to your drinks or whatever. Took us a couple of days to figure out the A/C...Couldn't turn it all the way up or it wouldn't come on, had to be set around 73, I think, for it to run. Small shopping center across the street has a few necessities in case you are in need plus the usual touristy items to take home as gifts. Merchants were very nice. One word of warning, though, there is a man with 2 spider-monkeys asking to take your picture with a monkey. One of the monkeys bit a young lady that we had visited with at dinner one night. I think I'll clear stear of the monkeys! We thoroughly enjoyed our 8 days at this resort. Would I go back? Yes..but then again, we don't usually do trips to the same resort.

We stayed 5 nights and this was our fifth trip to Mexico/Cancun but our first time to Playa Del Carmen. We had read reviews on trip advisor prior to booking, so we pretty much knew what to expect. It was worth it and we are so glad we booked despite some of the negative comments. We are not the fancy/luxury type, so perhaps our expectations were right on. Atmosphere: The beach is the best we've seen so far in Mexico. The beaches in the resort strip of Cancun fail in comparison to the beauty of Playa Del Carmen. The resort is quaint and very laid back. The staff work the pool area to get people involved, but in general this is a nice, quiet resort. If you are looking for a party atmosphere, a different resort is better for you. However, if you are looking for a relaxed environment where the staff is happy serve you, this is it. Food/drinks: We were very satisfied with all of the food options at RIU Playacar. The steakhouse is nice, and we really enjoyed the asian restaurant. Make sure to get your reservations early in the morning at breakfast. The buffet for breakfast, lunch, and dinner had a wide variety to choose from and we had no complaints whatsoever. The bartenders at the lobby bar and the swim up bar make sure you have a drink in hand at all times, and often get you your next drink before you have to ask for another. The only complaint we had was that there isn't beach service, so if you are enjoying the sun by the beautiful ocean on one of the resorts many beach chairs, you have to walk up to the bar to get your drinks yourself. We saw several people that had brought their own mugs, and that seemed to be a good idea. Rooms: As expected, the beds are pretty hard. We asked the front desk clerk on our first day for a mattress pad/cushion for the bed. She didn't seem to know what we were talking about, but had us write down our request. When we returned to the room later that day, someone had put a pad on the beds. We knew ahead of time that the rooms did not have \"true\" king beds. RIU could really improve upon their rooms if they just changed the beds because two doubles pushed together does not equal a king. It was okay though, small in comparison to the beauty and service of the resort. The room was cleaned daily, and we recommend leaving a few dollars by the sink each morning because the staff really appreciate it and they work hard for little to nothing. Also, we left quarters in the refrigerator and by doing so got extra cerveza and water. They only service the room drinks every two days, but if you track down the carts you can ask for extra water any day. We recommend visiting the other RIU properties in the area. The RIU Yucatan is about a 10 minute walk from the Playacar and has a great outdoor bar. Also, the show at the Yucatan is outstanding and more spectacular than the Playacar! There is a singer that performs with the dance group at the Yucatan and she is very good. We ate lunch at the Yucatan one day, and we actually preferred the buffett at the Playacar because it seemed to have more variety and options than our visit to Yucatan's lunch buffett. We also recommend taking a walk down the beach to the undeveloped, natural beach. It is gorgeous and very secluded. It takes about 30 minutes from the RIU Yucatan, but so worth the walk/time once you get there. WIFI in the lobby is a nice feature, we spent many most mornings and evenings in the lobby using our laptop. There is also shopping right across the street if that is your thing. Overall, we were very pleased and are looking forward to visiting Playa Del Carmen again!", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati", "Title": "\u201cRiu Playacar\u201d", "Author": "jmckib", "ReviewID": "UR118865249", "Content": "My wife and I traveled to Playa del Carmen, Mexico from 9/24-10/1/2011. We went via an Apple Vacations package out of Cincinnati and stayed at the Riu Playacar. We arrived at the hotel at 1:30 and were able to check in to our room immediately. We got our room keys, which are real keys, not electronic cards and the key to the room safe, again, not electronic, a real, old fashioned key. They gave us one lanyard so you may want to bring one of your own if multiple people will be using the keys. We stayed together almost the entire week so we just used the one key. Ours was the standard Riu room. We did not opt for the Jr. Suite upgrade. The room was pretty big with a king sized bed with 2 nightstands, a small table and 2 chairs, a desk and dresser. The bathroom was big with a single sink, mini fridge and Riu liquor dispenser (4 flavors of cheap liquor which we never used), a giant closet which held the safe. The shower stall was pretty big with a curtain. The water pressure was good although the temperature was subject to change without notice. The mini fridge had 2 liters of water which we used for brushing our teeth and taking pills since the tap water is not potable. It also had some Dos Equis beers, some Pepsis, 7-Ups, Orange Soda and Club Soda. We would leave the housekeeper notes asking for specific drinks and they always honored our request. The room was nice but showed some signs of wear and tear. A couple of the tiles had cracks, some of the grout lines were a little worn and some of the woodwork showed some wear. The ceiling had a couple of cracks in the stucco. It wasn\u2019t terrible but could just use a little freshening up. The TV had a lot of channels. Most were in Spanish or had Spanish subtitles. There as an ABC and NBC channel from Miami and a Mexican WB channel than had an odd mix of reruns like Friends as well as some new programs from a variety of US networks. There was a CNN Headline News channel in English and a very strange Fox News offering that had shows starting at stopping at random times. The TV itself was about a 26\u201d CRT type set. I wish the remote had a sleep timer but was fine otherwise. As always, the beds were really hard. I love the hard Mexican beds but my wife asked for a mattress pad which was added right away. It was considerably softer. Our room was #5316, on the 3rd floor of building 5, closest to the entertainment stage. You could hear the shows at night but it didn\u2019t keep us from sleeping. I\u2019d actually requested a room as close to the beach and pool area as possible and at check-in it seemed that they\u2019d made note of that. There are no elevators so if you don\u2019t like steps you may want to ask to be on a lower floor. The grounds were very well kept. All the trees, shrubs and plantings were immaculate. The walkways were wide and well lighted. They staff in charge of the grounds always seemed to be working on something and were very friendly. The pool area has 2 pools, one where all the activities seem to take place, with a swim up bar, and another that is quieter. The quieter pool was big enough and seemed to be so little used that it was easy to swim laps if you wanted. The more active pool had Aqua-size sessions, Water Volleyball and Polo and other activities every day. The swim up bar also had a walk up side. The beach at the Riu Playacar is very nice. The sand was a little coarse so it didn\u2019t stick to you as badly as some really fine sands do. There is lots of shade under palm trees. There were always plenty of lounge chairs. We were told that occupancy was low so it could be harder to find a good spot in busier times. The sand was not hot so it was easy to walk on but it\u2019s not a great walking beach because doesn\u2019t have a wide, smooth, hard surface like you find of some beaches. The water was super clear and a very nice temperature. The Riu Playacar offers kayaks, Hobie Cats, and snorkeling gear for guests to use free of charge. There are vendors on the beach who offer parasailing and jet skis for a fee. We weren\u2019t interested so we didn\u2019t ask about the price. There are other vendors who roam the beach, selling mostly silver jewelry or Cuban cigars. I\u2019d be very doubtful of the authenticity of either. They weren\u2019t too pesky and were easy to wave off if you weren\u2019t interested. The food overall was good. Breakfast and dinner are both served in the main dining room just off the lobby. Lunch is offered at an open air restaurant adjacent to the pools and beach area. There are also 2 specialty restaurants, a steakhouse and an Asian place, that you can go to once per week. We ate at the steakhouse and it was not bad. They offer 4-5 different entrees and everything else, salad, sides and dessert, is the same. Breakfast was good and about the same every day. They had cereals, an assortment of cold cuts, cheeses and fruits, as well as bacon, sausages, fried potatoes and pancakes. Lunch was also pretty unchanging day to day. There were hamburgers and hot dogs as well as a big salad bar. They always had some Mexican offering along with some pastas. Some of the foods seemed a little odd or out of place. But they do cater to a lot of Europeans and South Americans so things are a little different. It seemed odd to us that they\u2019d have cold cuts at breakfast but not for lunch. They also had a soft serve ice cream machine. Various juices, coffee and soft drinks (Pepsi products but 7-Up instead of Sprite and no Mt. Dew) and beer were available in the lunch and breakfast area. Dinner in the main buffet dining room seemed to usually have a theme. One night was Mexican, another was Seafood and another was Asian. There was a huge variety of things to eat. There were soups and hors d\u2019 oeuvres, salads, bread of all kinds. They had a carving station with various side dishes close by. They also had a sort of kids corner that always had pizza, hamburger and hot dogs and spaghetti. They had a big variety of desserts and an ice cream freezer with 8-10 different flavors. Some of the theme nights appealed to me more than others but I don\u2019t see how you could ever be in danger of not finding something you\u2019d like. The quality of the food was good to very good, 4 or a scale of 1-5. We enjoyed drinks at all the bars. The beer on tap was Dos Equis. I didn\u2019t see any other kind of beer anywhere in the resort. The selection of liquor was good, not great, with usually 1 or 2 name brands. For example, they offered Jim Beam or Early Times bourbon, good booze but nothing premium. The bartenders were not stingy. I always got a healthy portion in all drinks I had. They made a pretty good Pina Colada and my wife said that the other blended drinks she tried were good too. There was entertainment every evening. Many nights there was something going on in the lobby outside the main dining room. One night they had a band, another night there was a singer and another a traditional Mexican trio. Each night at 9:45 they put on a show in the theater. We went to a couple of these. One in particular, The Movie Show, had some pretty good dancers interpreting various movie musicals. We were surprised to learn that The Matrix was a musical as it was featured in one dance number. Other shows were a little weak and we left early. The Vegas Show had some showgirls but not much else in the way of Vegas references, no Elvis, no Rat Pack, no Wayne Newton or Liberace. The Animation Team at the Riu Playacar did a great job of interacting with the guests and keeping things lively. It always amazes me how these kids work so hard for what seems like about an 18 hour day and always be so upbeat. They really do seem like they\u2019re having fun. Having been to this area 2 other times we did no excursion or side trips of any kind. I walked into town one morning, moseyed around and took some photos. I bought 2 Cokes and took a cab back to the hotel since it was hot. All told my wife and I spent about $15.00. Here are my pros and cons of the Riu Playacar: Cons: \u2022 I hate shampoo and body wash in those little envelopes. They are difficult to open with dry hands and just about impossible when you\u2019re in the shower. Why not go with a refillable pump dispenser in the shower? It would have to be cheaper and would produce virtually no waste compared to all those little packets that get used daily. \u2022 The service in the main dining room was inconsistent. One day we\u2019d get a waiter who was very attentive about clearing plates or bringing drinks. The next time, we ended up stacking dirty plates on the table next to us and getting our own refills. We thought maybe we were giving off some signal that said \u201cdon\u2019t approach us\u201d but we couldn\u2019t figure out what it was. \u2022 On our departure day we\u2019d requested a wake up call that never came. We had set the alarm clock in the room as well as a cell phone alarm for backup. \u2022 It was nice that they offered Wi Fi in the lobby but they should really crank up the bandwidth. Some nights it was almost impossible to get a web page to open. It was always very slow, especially when there were a lot of users. The shadow of the service area was confined strictly to the lobby. It didn\u2019t even work in the dining room or just outside the lobby. Pros: \u2022 The staff was great. Everyone was friendly and cheerful. Even when it was spotty, as in the dining room, I didn\u2019t feel like they staff was lazy or didn\u2019t care. It seemed like someone was mistaken about who was responsible for us. The front desk was helpful; the housekeepers did a great job. No complaints about the staff at all. \u2022 I felt like the value of the trip was excellent. We got a very good low season price. The air travel was smooth and hassle free and the resort had everything we wanted. \u2022 Playa del Carmen is a beautiful spot. The weather was perfect!", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Parksville, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDidn,t want to leave!!!\u201d", "Author": "patsky22", "ReviewID": "UR118717827", "Content": "We stayed from Sept 18th-25th only bad part is we had to leave and come back to reality the hotel grounds,rooms and staff were all wonderful beach was excellente this was our first alinclusive that we pretty much were on the beach from morning till late afternoon palm tree,s for shade instead of palapas was great funny to watch everyone move there loungers allday to get shade or sun including us.The food was great no complaints there never had to take imodium or zantac and being able to have the use of three sister resorts was also wonderful.The evening shows were also great went to all which was a first the entertainment staff work very hard all day then at night!!!Now for the bar staff Ramos,Charlie,Daniel,Friuedious(think thats how it,s spelt if not sorry) and dear sweet Nancy were all welcoming and fun watch out for those teqiula slammers!!!Rooms were always nicely cleaned love the animals on the beds .The only complaint I would say pillows are alittle firm or flat I like soft my other half no problem and our room was 1204 on the service side of the resort next door and the walk way to and from for the employees between the 2 reastuarants and show theater besides would we return deffinately planning next April usually try another but loved this one being able to walk around the area outside the resort within the other resorts was great also a market across the street alittle pricey but found that even on 5th from last time we were the last April all in all Excellente!!!!!

The food was lovley you had a buffet breakfast every morning so much choice cereal, bacon, eggs, fruit, hams, cheeses, pastries(crossiants muffins...) pancakes, fried bananas, porridge etc also made there own smoothies which was very nice. Dinner again buffet different made soups everyday, cassoroles, stews, different veg, pizza's, pasta's, chips, different meats to make your own fajitas, salad, cakes, ice cream etc. Evening meal another big buffet or you have choice of 3 restaurants (Steak, Mexican, Asian) all 3-4 course meals. Steak was our favourite you could choose from steak, ribs, ckicken, skewers all very nice. Mexican you could have fajitas chicken pork beef another good menu. Asian was buffet style basically chinese food spring rolls rice's curry's also had sushi lots to choose from. If you want to go to one of the 3 restaurants (not the evening buffet) you book them at breakfast with waiter eaisly done. Evening wear for men is no t-shirts (not that people took this into notice) and 3 quarter pants are fine. The weather was also good we had a afternoon of thunder + lightning one day but was so glad of it as was still so humid.

This resort offers very good service. The buffets are outstanding and the choices are plentiful. You will find something if not several things that you will enjoy eating. The service in the restaurants is very good. As soon as you sit down, they are right there, asking for your drink orders and they are very attentive to your needs. This doesnt always happen at all inclusives. I think this hotel offers some of the best service I have witnessed in the restaurants at an all inclusive. This hotel is an older property. However, it's very well kept. The bathrooms are very clean and modern with nice tile floors and a marble vanity area. Yes, there are plenty of newer hotels you could stay at, but for the price, this hotel is a nice value. The beach at this property is amazing. It's a wide beach area with white sugar sand and lined with palm trees. You can find plenty of shady area's where you could curl up with a book under a palm tree, or you could drag your chair out from underneath the palm areas and have exposure to full sun. The water color here is blue blue crystal clear water. There are not rocks as you are walking into the water. It's soft sand and just a georgous beach! Most beaches in the Playa Del Carmen area are very nice. This one is one of the best beaches. They do offer exchange privledges with the Riu Tequila (across the street) and the Riu Yucatan (a few hotels down). Here is my only criticism. This hotel is by far the smallest out of the Riu's in the Riviera Maya. We traveled with our two children ages 14 and 16. They were very bored in the evening. They are just a little too old to enjoy the shows. During the day they were fine, they kept busy with poolside games and beach activities. The evening entertainment is non existant for teenage kids. You have to walk across the street to the Riu Tequila where they have a sports bar. It's a total rip off. They want $3 a table to play a game of pool. It's a racket, because they know there is nothing else for kids that age to do. So you will end up spending a lot of money in the game room to keep kids of that age entertained. Other than that, they can watch tv, or go to bed. I feel the Riu could offer something for them to do in the evenings. They could have games for them to use. Chess, Checkers, more ping pong tables for night play for their ages. They were very bored. If we didnt have the kids we would have been fine. For teens though, virtually NOTHING for them to do in the evenings without you spending money. Other than that, this is a solid 1st class hotel.

I will begin with the rooms, they were exceptionally clean upon arrival and stayed that way throughout the trip, the room staff did a great job of cleaning the room every day and even left us a towel animal every day!! The next part is the food, the breakfast buffet was awesome, there was not anything we ate that was bad. The lunch buffet was hit or miss, for us anyways, but we still found something to eat. We even visited Riu Tequilla and Riu Yucatan for lunch and there food was great. The dinner buffet was also very good, great selection of food and always fresh. We did eat at the steakhouse one night and it was delicious, but keep in mind that it is outdoors and during July it was hot. On to the outdoors, the pool was fantastic, and the beach was even better. We did partake in the kayaks one day, all non-motorized water sports are included, and the kayak was an adventure if you have never done one..hahaha. The staff, what can I say, there was not one staff member that we came across that did not have a smile on their face!!

The other one was Alberto at the poolside bar, both of these employees went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of. One thing I will recommend, take your own insulated cup, the ones that they serve drinks in are about 8oz.

This is my sixth time at an all-inclusive and my fourth to Riviera Maya, so I have some experience. I have stayed at Riu Bambu (D.R.), Xcaret, Ocean Bavaro(D.R.), H10 Ocean Coral & Turquesa, Dreams Tulum, and now Riu Playacar. The Riu Playacar has a couple of things going for it. First the location is central Riviera Maya, about 5 minutes from Playa Del Carmen and close to the Ferry in Cozumel. Because of this, you will find some of the best excursions and Scuba diving in Mexico. The beaches are pristine, probably the most beautiful and calm that I have ever seen. There are no reefs off of the beach and very few debris when going in and out of the water. The main buffet was generally good, better than most resorts I have been to. They had a wide variety of foods, including American and European fare. I can honestly say I didn't throw much away because I liked most of it. I can also say I did not get sick the entire time I was there -- a first for any resort. The snack bar was OK standard pool-side fare (burgers, fries, chips, etc). However, there are many things this resort can improve upon. First, do not be fooled by claims that they have theme restaurants, or that you can share the other resorts ameneties. You were only allowed to eat dinner at your own resort. Riu Playacar had three \"themes\", one steakhouse, one Mexican, and one asian. We were confused the first night trying to find the steakhouse, because it was combined with the Mexican on the lunch buffet (not air conditioned). Their idea of a theme restaurant was a different colored tablecloth, and that meant a different restaurant. The asian did have its own separate space, but it was just a buffet! It was the only air conditioned place aside from bathrooms and bedrooms in the entire resort. They served carnival-style fried vegetables with every theme meal, which was strange. The salads were terrible. The asian was acceptable. The steakhouse only let you choose your entree -- the appetizers and dessert were standard. Overall I would give the theme restaurants a 3/10. Do not come here unless you plan to eat at the buffet a lot. The entertainment was good, but nobody showed up! They have a themed Michael Jackson show, Mariachis, and the general entertainment crew shows. Later on our trip we found out where everybody was each night because they have the same shows on different nights -- Riu Tequila across the street. Other issues with this resort: The beds were hard as a 4 inch stack of towels on a cement floor. The \"king\" bed was two doubles pushed together. There was a constant gap between us, although we didn't mind since we would just snuggle up on one side or the other. It also didn't hurt that there was unlimited liquor bar in your room and that certainly could help a person to sleep. The TV was a standard definition at about 24 inches. Loud fire alarms went off every single night. When we questioned the desk about this, they said everything was OK. I'm glad there were no fires or we would have been in trouble. The Scuba diving instructors were awesome especially Javier and Pancho. However, please know that they do not actually have their own scuba boats. When you want to dive, you take a nice hike 2 resorts or so to the south to the Wyndham. They are not cheap either, about $15 higher than other resorts I have been to. I mentioned previously that the beaches are pristine, and they are. There are plenty of people during the day and night due to the central location, so don't try to sneak in any skinny dipping (we contemplated this on a full moon). There is another problem with the location: right next door is a jet-ski rental place, so all day there are jet skis in and out from where you are swimming. Jet-ski and motor boat fumes were almost constant during the day, and this really annoyed me. The water in the resort could use some extra chlorine. I could often smell sewer stench in the outside showers and only smelled it once on the showers in the room. Dos Equis is the standard beer, which is good enough for me. They do have top shelf liquors but rarely serve them unless requested. The tequila here is not good. I have been to tequila tasting in Dreams Tulum and they provided interesting and good aged tequilas. Riu's idea of tequila tasting was flavoring cheap mezcal tequila with different types of fruits. On a lighter note, I am from Pittsburgh so we know our ketchup (Heinz). The ketchup here is horrendous so bring your own. Overall, I had a good time as would be expected with a beatiful beach, happy and relaxed wife, unlimited drinks, food, and entertainment. However maybe I'm becoming a bit spoiled. I know what to look for, so I will not be back to this resort or the others we visited (Tequila, Playacar, Yucatan).", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cCouldnt fault Rio Playacar\u201d", "Author": "scarlettpolo", "ReviewID": "UR116124275", "Content": "This was our first trip to Mexico and we loved it .

Although if you only eat hamburgers, hot dogs, and chicken nuggets then, yes, these are not the best items on the menu. However, there is an unlimited supply of fresh fruit and vegetables, fresh fish, chicken, beef and a large variety of desserts. If you want to eat healthily, it's available. If you want to gorge yourself, that's easy, too! Each night there was a special entree along with sveral other \"standard\" entrees like grouper, grilled chicken, steak, etc. For breakfast the smoothie bar is great and there are plenty of options from bacon and eggs to dry cereal to oatmeal to fresh donuts. The coffee was excellent. Our family of four never had a bad meal and we all have varied preferences. We tipped the waitstaff a few bucks at each meal and they treated us like royalty. The rooms were very nice: Spacious and clean. We had connecting rooms which worked out very well. The housekeeping service was excellent. I have never seen a maid lying on the floor mopping under a bed before! The room was spotless. As people have mentioned, the beds are very hard. I liked them but you can request mattress toppers. The pillows are small so we requested extras. The beach is clean and beautiful with plenty of lounge chairs. The bar is close by and they also bring drinks down to the beach to hand out. Very nice. With regard to drinks, they are small but our solution was to request two at a time. The alcohol is certainly not top shelf but the drinks were delicious. Dos Equis beer taps are everywhere so beer is not an issue. As far as tipping goes, we gave the bartenders a dollar or two about half the time and they were very appreciative. My only complaints: 1. The room keys are standard metal keys with the room number stamped on it. This is a major security issue. We lost one of our keys and it was never found so we had to have the room lock changed. The room locks should be upgraded to card-keys or keyless entry devices especially at a beach resort where you don't want to carry keys around. 2. the in-room safe has a removable lock cylinder that you are issued upon check-in along with the safe key. It is very awkward to manipulate the lock cylinder. These safes should be upgraded to keyless entry. 3. The fitness center is located at an adjacent RIU property. It is a very sad fitness center: very few pieces of aerobic equipment, the facility is very small, the weight machine was missing components. It really needs to be upgraded and it would be nice to have the fitness center located on the RIU Playacar property.

I checked the reviews on all the hotels in Playacar for a while and nearly booked the Yucatan. I'm so glad i didn't and chose the Playacar instead as it's a smaller hotel and everything is so close. We were in the pink block, the last one on the left hand-side when walking down to the pools. Our room was better than expected. Cleaned everyday, with a mini bar and fridge loaded every other day. We did ask for a pad mattress on arrival as bed was a bit hard and that really helped. The food at the restaurants was great. I'm not a big fan of buffets and can be quite fussy but i always found lots of things i liked. The service is absolutely perfect, we did give some tips sometimes but nobody is really waiting for it and everyone is happy to serve you with a smile as well!! The entertainment team was cool, we did some activities during the day and would go to the shows most nights as they were really good. My favourite were Michael Jackson and Grease. We went twice to Coco Bongo with the hotels and i really recommend it. You will get an area reserved for the hotel with your own waiter. They do expect tips though so you will need to give them some money at the end of the night. The bars at the hotel are great, the service is really fast and they do remember what you like. We would tip them $1, especially at the pool bar. The pools are nice and cleaned everyday. The water is really hot in the afternoon so we would use them in the morning and go to the beach at the end of the day. We went a few times to Riu Tequila which i really liked. It's a shame it's not by the beachfront. The pool over there is great and much bigger, as well as the pool bar. We tried the Yucatan once but didn't like it. Too crowded and looks dated. Excursions: we went to a full day trip to Chitzen Itza. Was great but such a hot day. On an other occasion, we went to Tulum and Hel-Xa in the afternoon but that was too short. I wished we had gone there the whole day as there is so much to do. We didn't book them with our rep as it was nearly double of what we paid. We found cheaper prices accross the hotel. Overall, i would recommend this hotel to anyone, it was a really good trip and as i'm a travel agent, i'm more fussy and exigeant and see lots of little details, and i have to say that Riu Playacar didn't disappoint. It is not a 5* hotel but the service, facilities and staff are wonderful.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "stigler", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "acitr", "ReviewID": "UR115919389", "Content": "This resort was very disappointing on many levels.

Although far from a new hotel all areas were kept spotlessly clean and the grounds were beautiful. Many of the reviews mention the beds are hard and they certainly are but I have to say we had no problems with them. The selection of spirits available in the room is fairly limited and consisted of local brands. We drink gin which was not available in our room although we eventually were given a bottle at the third time of asking. The buffet (main) restaurant always had a wide choice of food available with a different theme every evening and the quality was excellent, far better than the speciality restaurants particularly the steak house which was very disappointing. Back to the drinks. International brands were available at all bars that also offered a wide range of most enjoyable cocktails which we sampled on a regular basis, have to say however that the wine on offer in this hotel is undrinkable. As we like a nice wine with our meals we switched to Cava only to find that after 3 days it was no longer available so again a bit disappointing. To sum up.

We booked a junior suite with Ocean View. The suite was directly across from the theater where the entertainment, music, LOUD DJ played until 11:30 or 12:00 pm. Neither daughter could sleep through the noise. We asked to me moved to a different suite but none were available, however, we did downgrade to a regular room. In that room, the shower was broken which we didn't discover until getting ready for dinner reservation. The maintenance staff fixed it, but we missed dinner. The dresser drawer was stuck after my daughter's clothes were in it and again maintenance came and fixed it, but it recurred the next day. We finally removed clothing and stored it back in the suitcase. Both daughters ended up with dozens of mosquito bites due to mosquito's being in the room. I was told that if we had complained to the front desk, they would have given us a plug in to zap the mosquitos but we didn't find out until the last day. The oddest thing is that there were no umbrellas on the beach. We love to spend time on the beach, but need the umbrella as we're all pretty fair skinned and don't want to be in the sun all day. Thus, we had to spend most of the time at the pool which was small, and very loud, but had umbrellas. The \"quiet\" pool was not at all quiet as a group of 21 arrived, mostly kids, and they used the \"quiet\" pool, rendering it very noisy. On the positive side, the staff was lovely, friendly, helpful. Of particular note, the entertainment staff was awesome - a woman named Elizabeth ran the Kid's Mini Club and for the first time, my daughter wanted to go to kids club each day -- Elizabeth was amazing with the kids and didn't \"babysit\" them but engaged them in all sorts of activities. The wait staff were also great. The grounds of the resort were very nice as well. All in all, we would not return to a Riu hotel even though we signed up for their loyalty program before we left as it looked as though they have hotels in many of the places we travel. If the Riu Playacar is indicative of the quality of the hotel, we definitely would not return as we found the overall experience to be sub-par compared to other all-inclusives which we've used previously. Also the fitness center is located at another Riu - a short walking distance but not very convenient at all. The food was mediocre and of the 3 restaurants, only 2 are open each night so you need to be at the lobby at 7:00 am in order to make reservations. The breakfast buffet was good, but lunch and dinner were ho-hum. I would not recommend a Riu hotel, and think you can do much better and spend less money elsewhere.

Prior to this trip, my wife, daughter and I have been had stayed at the RIU Palace Las Americas in Cancun and my wife and I celebrated our 10th Anniversary at the Grand Palladium Kentenah Resort in Riviera Maya so we had other all-inclusive examples to compare to the RIU Playcar. If you are looking for large swimming pools with 'beds' submerged just below the water level to keep you cool, multiple swim-up bars, a wide variety of specialty restaurants (RIU Playacar has three of which only two were open during our four night stay), a large range of options in the daily breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack offerings or a work-out room, then look into a bigger RIU resort where they will tell you in advance that they offer or specialize in such amenities. Of course those 'extras' will cost you. The RIU Playacar is compact, perfectly situated and a really good value. First, this resort is small and by that I mean you are no more than a 3-4 minute walk from the farthest room to the pool. From your room, you are also no more than 3-4 minutes from the lobby where they offer free WiFi. Those are REALLY good things! Second, this resort is set up for you to roll to the beach with no hassles. From your room, you are no more than a 5 minute walk to the pristine azure beaches which is one of the main reasons to come to Riviera Maya in the first place. That gets me to my third point. The friendliness, professionalism and promptness of the entire service, bar and front desk staff was above, and beyond, expectations. At this RIU, you get MORE than what you pay for and that is called 'value'. Perhaps 'value' is a RIU trademark but I appreciated this resort's polite, quick and thorough responses to my requests nonetheless. Finally, the RIU Playacar is 1.8 miles from Playa Del Carmen's 5th Avenue shopping, shops and restaurants which is a $7.00 cab ride away. This resort is also a 10 minute walk to the RIU Yucatan and RIU Tequila where you will enjoy breakfast and lunch and also pool/beach privileges. This gives you options to change up your vacation 'routine' if you plan to visit more than 4 nights. I took an informal poll of my wife, daughter and her friend as our 4-night vacation wound down. Each of them agreed that the RIU Playacar felt safe and relaxing and that it had an abundance of capable/outstanding staff, excellent performers in their nightly shows and comfortable (ask for the mattress pads before your first night of sleep) and clean rooms. They marveled how easy it was to reach their main goal every day of getting much-prized sun time at the beach/pool and how they didn't feel pressured by beach salesmen hawking faux silver or quasi-Cuban cigars, unlike at some other all-inclusive resorts they'd experienced (and definitely unlike the salesmen in the circus atmosphere of 5th Avenue in Playa Del Carmen). In the same breath, however, they spoke about how much fun it was to leave the resort for shopping in Playa Del Carmen, to go work out a few doors down at a different RIU, to take an excursion or enjoy extra activities elsewhere outside this resort. In sum, at the RIU Playacar, you WILL relax and you WILL enjoy tasty frosty drinks in an idyllic beach setting easily accessible from your room. You will get more than your money's-worth as long as you aren't expecting the amenities of the larger and more expensive resorts.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat beach\u201d", "Author": "beachbumIllinois", "ReviewID": "UR113736724", "Content": "Of all the Riu resorts.Playacar is a small one that packs a punch..Also great mexican food..", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, WI", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place\u201d", "Author": "Chrispy52", "ReviewID": "UR113550500", "Content": "Resort was great!

There are a few Riu's on the same stretch and when you go and browse around the others you will see for yourselves that this isn't the nicest one. It's advertised as a 5* hotel but to be honest I think I've stayed in better 3*. However it was my first time to the Caribbean and I'm not sure if i was expecting too big a thing! The one thing I can say here though is the people are absolutely lovely! They all work really hard to maintain the hotel to look as pretty as it does - The animation team are fab and we had a really great time with them. They even took us on a couple of nights out in the main town which I thought was really nice .. They made a real effort! The food wasn't all that to be honest - There's a vast choice but they don't really cater for fussy eaters! It all tastes the same... Eggs for breakfast is as good as it gets! We did a few trips The Dolphin Swim which was absolutely amazing ... We got to swim with stingrays and manatees which was a real experience. We also went on a speedboat trip were we sailed out into the middle of the sea and jumped off to go snorkeling around a barrier reef - That was brilliant! If you go into the town shopping it's the same as many other towns abroad - They are extremely pushy..... You can't have a look at something because you WILL leave with it! The entertainment in this hotel wasn't really good ... you could tell they made the effort but it was tailored to suit children more than anything which I found a bit boring - and...It started at 10.30! I was ready for bed by then after a long day in the sun! The rooms aren't really anything new.. They are just very basic...Beds are so uncomfortable! Our room was infested with mosquitos as-well so we were all ripped to shreds by the end of our stay.. after asking several times at check in someone came around and sprayed outside the room and the mosquitos eventually disappeared (A tip..Turn your outside light off and they won't fly in) Pools were absolutely freezing but always kept really clean which was a bonus.. The beach was lovely but I think after a few storms the sea was abit rough and there were alot of debris so you couldn't really swim in it... The water was lovely and warm when you could get in though. If your going to go on the Jet Skis please be advised they are VERY expensive... Overall this hotel was OK but I don't think it was really up to the standard of what we paid for.

Little shopping mart across from them with prices more or less as high as 5th St in Playa - have to get off the main street to find real deals!

Not as much walking as most resorts in the area. Our room was nice & clean, had to call and get the foam topper put on our bed, because of the hardness. Once they did it was much better. The beach was BEAUTIFUL and clean, plus both pools were kept clean. Water in the pool and ocean was a nice temp. Not too cold or too warm perfect. We went to 5th Ave in Playa del Carmen one night, decided on a taxi, cost $7 each way. Went to the shopping area across the street, but was much pricier than 5th Ave. We also did two excursions Xel-Ha which we have been to before, but wanted to go back there for the snorkling. We also went to Xplor which I would HIGHLY recommend. We had a blast there. First time to zipline for me, it was so much fun. Took advice from a forum, we bought our tickets on-line before we left at a discount and took a taxi from the hotel ($15 each way), which was cheaper than buying a package from a tour operator. What was really nice when we got there the line for on-line purchases was MUCH shorter than the one with the people who took the tour buses. I would not recommend this park for children under 5, not much for them to do there. We are in our mid-50's and was able to do everything the park had to offer. Except the Jaguar zipline. One of the towers was just too much to climb. Would def go back to this park. We are considering our fall vacation and will probably go back to Punta Cana, but will not rule out going to this resort.

Though the hotel is definitely not a 5* hotel but we got exactly what we've been looking for: clean rooms, good pool, great beach, excellent location. The resort is very close to Playa del Carmen and you can walk there from the resort for about 20min or catch a taxi that will cost you 7US dollars. Also the hotel offers the use of the favilities in other Riu hotels (except the Palace hotels) however you can eat only breakfast or lunch in the other hotels, no dinner.

Food: buffet has fresh variety and I would recommend it to anyone staying in the resort, but cannot say the same about the 2 restaurants that we tried, Jade (sushi) and the Steak restaurant. Steak restaurant was pretty terrible, unless you really like your steak well done. As for the sushi, unless you really like rice, it doesn't worth the visit.\u00a0 The best lunch I had is where they prepared seafood sabiche along the pool that was one of the best I ever ate.

The Room. The room was a surprise to us and was great. It was roomy and had a bath and a shower too.The bed we found to be a bit hard but we have been to places where the beds are much harder than the one's we encountered there.A mattress topper wasn't needed,but I have been told that one is available if it is needed. The Food. The food was great. We had at least 8 different courses including fruit,soup and sweet's.It would suit the fusiest of eaters and if there is any compaint about the food there then I would suggest to the people to try to find somewhere else to complain about.The Mexican restaurant was a bit of a disapiontment though as the food wasn't at all spicy but was still good none the less.The Steakhouse was good too as we had Ribeye Steak with everything with it and it melted in your mouth and was cooked how we wanted it.We didn't try the Oriental restaurant as we forgot to book it. The Show's. The show's were very well done and dispite the small venue was exelent. There was a disapointment at one of the show's but the free beer made up for that.Well done to everyone cocerened with those show's The Place. Playa De Carmen is only a short walk from the hotel.

Be prepared to be asked by all the traders to look into their shop.Apolite \"No thank you\" will be OK and they wont bother you again unless you walk back through.We didnt get to see any of the club's in town as we can't see everything on the first trip.Coco Bongo's is the place to go as well as Senior Frog's.They are both easy to get there and a short taxi ride will take you to either of them. Dont pay more than 7 dollar's for the taxi from the RIU Playacar hotel. The People. We felt very safe in Mexico. You hear about trouble in various places,but there is none in Playa De Carmen at all.We went to a Mexican bar and had a drink there and I even went scuba diving and left my wife to her own divices and was surprised to find out later that she had walked back to the hotel without any sort of trouble at all.The police were very polite and would talk to you and treat as you would hope to be treated. The Beach. The beach was great and the sand was very white and glorious.The sea was great and was turquoise in colour and very safe.The tempratures were between 28 and 38 deg.My wife went topless and wasn't bothered by anyone.Dont try to go topless round the pool as there are children about and it would be impolite to do so.I didnt notice anyone topless round the pool anyway. Our thanks. Our thank's go out to:- Rouben,Joshua,Maria and Paulo who were the entertainment staff.Joshua was a mad man and not from this planet.Paulo was a great compair and was very daft as well.Rouben made our stay a pleasure and was a credit to the team.Maria was the birthday girl and helped my wife to play some games etc.Gilberto in the lobby resteraunt was great and a couple fo dollars went a long way with him.The room's were kept to a standard high enough for a more expensive place,again a couple of dollars went down well as we had towel animals on our bed everyday.The boss man who upgaded us was a star and we thank him alot.There was also a great couple from Vancouver Canada who we have become very close too and are planning a visit to their country as soon as we can.Hello to Joanne and Greg.We love you lot's guy's.There was also a few people from Featherstone Yorkshire who we met there as well who have said they will come over to see us.

Nothing wrong to say regarding the flight and the transfers airport-hotel, that were included in the package. In the airport, of course, Mexican border control took some time \u2013 around 1 hour to 1,5 hours. But the transfer organization was perfect and we had no problems at all. In Mexico nowadays, they accept usdollars, euros and of course pesos. The exchange rate in most shops was correct, in the hotel was a bit worse. From Europe, take euros (in May, 1 euro = 16.5 pesos). It took us around 1 hour to get to the resort, as the bus stopped at several other resorts first (we were the last ones !). The resort, built in 1997, is beautiful, well maintained and clean. The staff, as said before, was excellent, always friendly and smiling, respectful and polite. Check-in was simple and fast \u2013 the room key, 2 towel cards and a key for the safe \u2013 and the room was large, with two double beds pushed together. The mattresses were a bit hard, but we are used to this. There is a bar in the room, refilled every other day. The tap water is potable, although we had at all times 3 x 1,5 liters mineral water bottles in the fridge, together with cans of cola and soda. There were 4 full bottles of vodka, tequila, gin and whisky, that were also refilled every other day. The ice was available in a specific place, in the ground floor. The drinks and the food were included in our all-inclusive package. We could drink and eat what we wanted, although bars and restaurants are not open at all times. But opening hours were generous. The bar staff (in any of the 3 bars) was friendly and very experienced. Of course there was a list of available drinks, and we loved the margaritas, strawberry daiquiris and pina coladas. Go to one bar and ask for 4 margaritas \u2013 no questions asked, they are ready in 2 minutes ! Lunches have to be in one of the restaurants, for dinners there are 4 options: Mexican, steak house, Oriental and general. The 3 first ones have to be booked at breakfast (limited places). The buffets were good, although a bit repetitive, after one week we were a bit tired of the same food every day. But the assortment was very good. Nice pool, but of course we preferred the beach (there are pools everywhere, although in this one the water temperature should be near 30 degrees C). But when the sea water is emerald blue and 27-28 degrees C, who wants to be in the pool ? There are some entertainment, but we didn\u2019t pay too much attention to this. Some days were better, others not so nice. We walked into Play del Carmen, but beware: it will not take you 5 to 7 minutes, but half an hour to get to the start of the town, and 15 minutes more to get to 5th avenue. All ground floors were shops, selling souvenirs, handicrafts, clothes, etc. Prices were normal, but most of the items were junk, \u201cmade in China\u201d type. We bought a Mayan type sculpture done in obsidian to take home \u2013 very nice for 300 pesos (18 euros !). The only BAD things for us \u2013 no decent expresso coffee available. Not in the hotel, not in the town. We only found a Nexpresso machine in an hotel near the ruins of Chichen Itza, were we had lunch in one of the full day excursions we took \u2013 outside the package, of course. The other excursion was to the island of Contoy. Both were very nice. After going to Chichen Itza, we plunge into a \u201ccenote\u201d, an unforgettable experience. There were many others excursions, to nature parks, adventure islands, etc. No mosquitoes or other bugs, although we were prepared with repellent. Not necessary to use during the day or night.

We traveled on a Monday and even though the lines we not too bad, it took us 1.5 hours to get through customs due to the lack of staff. Make sure you are not starving when you depart the flight. I strongly recommend pre-booking transportation prior to arrival. The number of people who try and get you into something else can be overwhelming. We pre-booked with Best Day travel and were very happy we did. At the exit of the airport doors (near the Margarita hut) there was a man wearing a Best Day uniform and holding a sign with company name. We walked up and he asked for our flight number and last name. With that information he knew our first names and where we were staying so I was very comfortable getting on the shuttle. It was only about a 35 minute ride from airport to our resort. Our resort the Riu PLayacar was beautiful. We didn't see much until the next day as we arrived right at nightfall and were exhasted from traveling. The lobby was beautiful open and large. CHECK-IN- Check-in was simple but they really didn't give much information about things that were offered. We were offered a map that showed the grounds and the other Riu resorts we could visit (and the ones we could not). Our single room key, 2 towel cards and a key for the safe. Next time we will ask all sorts of questions and not just assume we'll be told. He was a very pleasant young man. The ROOM- The room was spacious. It had two full/double beds pushed together. THey were VERY VERY hard mattresses but we usually sleep on a firm. (at home you can't feel the springs). They only use a top sheet and a cover that should not be used as a blanket. Covers at hotels should NEVER be used as a blanket. It was always warm/muggy, but if you get easily cold they have blankets in the closet. There is a bar in the room (yippee) along with a 2 -pepsi,2- 7up, 2-club soda and 2-orange drinks. 3 large bottles of water. They re-fill the fridge every other day. That was great. One thing that SHOULD have been mentioned at the check in 'the room water is not potable' I did not notice the little tiny sticker on the bottm corner of the mirror that stated so. I had already brushed my teeth when my boyfriend saw it! YUK. The bath towels were nice and soft and we had pleanty of them. We were in the first building off the lobby, very quiet most nights. THE FOOD- the head Waiter informed us where we had to sign up for the 2 of the 3 dinners they offered that were not a part of the buffet. This was optional. If you chose to have the buffet every night, you could. These were just alternative dining options at no extra cost. They had Japanese, Mexican and a Steak house. We just loved the buffet. We tried the Japanese place, 'Jade' something and were very very dissapointed :( After that we chose to stick with the buffet. The breakfast became monotonous, but the dinners were always a little different and delish. Breakfast and dinner were in the main Lobby area at the front of the resort. The lunches were offered, buffet style, out near the pool and beach. Lunches were always nice and changed every so often. The assortment on all buffets (B L & D) were wonderful. So much to chose from. THE POOL/BEACH- We loved the swim up bar. THough it was closed the 1st 3 days of our stay for maintenance (we understand things need upkeep). The water was warm in the pool closest to the beach, with the bar. We never got into the first pool, with the fountain. There is a bathroom by the pool, near the stage. Dont forget to turn in your towels or they will charge you. We left ours on chairs all day and nobody messed with them but we almost forgot them once :) The white sand beach was ten feet away from the pool. There were pleanty of chaise lounge chairs. THey never ran out. Palm trees line the first 7 yards (+ -) of sand and then it's open blue skys over powdered sand that paled in comparison to the blue/green water. We love kids, being parents ourselves, but we loved the fact that there weren't many kids around. We wanted to get away from it all. not for the screaming to follow us. ENTERTAINMENT- We missed out on a lot of things because until our 3/4th day there, we didnt realize there was a board in the lobby that informed you of activities going on. Also nobody ever told us about the water activites they offer. We found out on our 2nd to last day. The information is right past the pool by the kiddy play area. We did catch a few night shows during the week that they offered on the stage near the beach/pool. Friday and saturday nights were EXTREMELY dissapointing!! I can not stress that enough...BORING!! We are 37 and 41 years old. We aren't into 'clubbing' but some live music would be nice...anything other than watching what looked to be like Circ De Sole on a huge tv screen. GAK. The bar tender said everyone goes to bars and clubs on weekends so they dont do anything :( OUTSIDE the resort- We walked into town excited afer reading so much about 5th street/avenue. Again, let down. THe prices for the mostly 'junk' they had were just silly. Many of the things said 'made in taiwan' We didn't buy anything to take home. Nothing was worth it. EXPLOR-GO GO GO. It was the most fun we had. So worth every penny and we will go again! Xel HA- boring after the 1st few hours. Wouldn't go again. Would recommend if it were a tad cheeper. Being a diver, snorkeling there got very boring after half hour. THe rest of it was just ok. THE BAD- We both got very very sick for 2 days. I had it worse than my boyfriend. Thankfully he brought amodium ad with us and had it on hand. I don't know where we got sick because we ate at EXPLOR and XEL HA in addition to the resort. Not passing blame, we excpected it to happen. not to big of a deal. BUT, the worst part is my boyfriend waking up on our 3rd morning with approx 50 bug bites all over the lower half of his body. It was aweful, disgusting and sad. I didn't have any bites at all and we think its because he had given me a massage with lemon and Eucalyptus oil the night before and I fell asleep with it still on. We told the front desk that morning and was told they would take care of it. We went out for the day and when we came back to our room, we were hoping there would be a note or SOMETHING to acknowledge that they HAD taken care of it. Nothing. I was so scared to climb into bed that night. We descided to spray the bed ourselves and go out for drink for a few hours to let it soak in. Thankfully we brought deet free bug spray with us from home. We also used the massage oil every night there after before going to bed. They really should have laft a note saying they took care of that. Staff-always friendly and smiles. Some of the bar tenders went a little over board with being friendly to me and upsetting my boyfriend. But that was only a select few. Most were respectful and curtious. CONCLUSION- if you are going for ultra affordable, this is a great place to stay. We may come back again but we have our sites on another resort next time if we can save a few hundred $$ more. We really did like the resort a lot. It was beautiful, good food and great staff. The whole bed thing is what is making me re-think about returning. Maybe next time I should just demand another room so I'm not scared to go to bed every night!!", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, England", "Title": "\u201cNot perfect but still worth a visit\u201d", "Author": "MancMan78", "ReviewID": "UR108091566", "Content": "The downsides first of all. The beds are indeed rock hard, the mattress topper does help but it was still an uncomfortable night's sleep a lot of the time. While the public areas were spotless, some of the room could have been better looked after - the fridge was stained as were some of the bedsheets and the clock radio had seen better days. There was a bit of a tired feel in terms of the decor, notably in the main restaurant and also the bedroom. Now for the good points. There are two pools, one is quiet and the other has the swim up bar and jacuzzi. The latter pool was closed for a few days for cleaning (it was less yellow afterwards!) but we scarcely used it so no loss. The quieter pool was lovely. Food was generally excellent. Good buffet restaurant for breakfast and dinner. There is a decent lunch buffet too at the restaurant by the pool. This splits into two at night as the steakhouse and Mexican speciality restaurants. Both are a la carte and very good. The Asian restaurant is by the lobby and is a buffet, relatively small choice but quality was fine. There is also a late night buffet here which is useful. In the early hours there are sandwiches and fruit in the lobby. On one occasion there was a delicious beach barbecue and another a tasty paella. The hotel has a wonderful location, right on the beach. Over the road is a pleasant shopping plaza. If you want to go to Playa del Carmen it is a 30 minute walk, or 70 pesos in a taxi (there's always a taxi around if need be). Playacar is a private complex, it was well kept and very safe. We had a quick look at Riu Yucatan and Riu Tequila and we think our hotel was smaller and more intimate, certainly more relaxed. The entertainment staff deserve huge credit. There were a handful of them but they never stopped, day and night. Always happy to see you, always smiling, always on the go. If there was an activity they wanted you to take part in they would approach you if you didn't look busy or asleep! But a no was always taken as a no and there was no hassle at all if you didn't want to get involve. The evening shows generally were worth watching, notably the professional dance acts. Service was always efficient and well done. If there was a problem it was solved quickly and with a smile. The restaurant and bar workers were very friendly all of the time. This hotel has its faults but they are easily outweighed by the good points and we'd recommend it to anyone.

My friend and I had the most amazing stay and holiday at the Riu Playacar in April and couldn\u2019t fault it. An absolutely stunning location with colourful blocks of rooms surrounded by beautiful gardens, trees and wildlife. The pool area is two tone, the pool with the fountain is very quiet and relaxed while the pool with the bar is more lively and where the games and fun happen. Throughout the day you never have to look very hard to get sun loungers; even at mid-day we managed to get 4 loungers together. The hotel is right on the white sandy beach and as there is no tide, the crystal clear sea is not far away. There are also ample sun loungers on the beach with palm trees to provide shade. Included in the package are a variety of water sports i.e. kayaking, windsurfing, catamaran and boogie boards (SCUBA diving demonstrations in the pool). Our room was sparkling on arrival and was cleaned daily, mini bar always full, clean sheets etc and was situated in block 5, which is closest to the pool/evening entertainment/beach which suited us well. We didn\u2019t find the beds too hard or the music from the evening entertainment too loud; we had such a good time through the day, by the time we got into bed we went straight to sleep! The food selection and quality was fantastic, there was always something new, brilliantly presented and fresh; breakfast was our favourite. The speciality restaurants we tried (Mexican and Steak House) were lovely too; one word of advice-go hungry! As well as this often during the day around the pool the kitchen staff came out and started up a BBQ, Paella or traditional Mexican food for lunch followed by fresh fruit salads/desserts being brought round to your sun lounger! The coconut party is brilliant too; dancing followed by coconuts hollowed and served with vodka/rum. The staff here couldn\u2019t work any harder. The housekeeping staff do a great job, are always smiling and pleasant (you will never walk past anyone with them giving you a cheery 'Hola!'). The restaurant staff are the same, always at your service and will come and chat to you. One member of staff was particularly happy and friendly (Pedro-Pablo) and always seemed happy to see you walk in. The entertainment team were also amazing and kind of made the holiday, Maria, Ruben, Mario and Joshua would always stop to say hello, crack some kind of joke and ask if we wanted to join in any of the activities, they would come and have a drink with us after the evening show and volunteer to escort us to bars/clubs in the town if we wanted to go. Activities happened most of the day with a different \u2018lazy game\u2019 and \u2018crazy game\u2019 each morning/afternoon which both were entertaining to participate in or watch-especially to water balloon fight! Plenty of laughs were had with all the team and we were sad to leave our new friends! The evening shows were well put together and good to watch while relaxing with a drink and on one evening the audience were the show; we all participated in various fun games (one side of the theatre against the other) and was great fun. If joining in is not your thing, you are never pressured to take part and can chose to do as much or as little as you like. The town of Playa Del Carmen is accessible by the beach or road and can be walked or a taxi will cost you 70 pesos. It is a lovely relaxing town with a beach and plenty of shops/bars/restaurants. If you want to venture further away, there is so much to do in Riviera Maya, Cancun and the surrounding area. We went on the Isla Mujeres trip which I would strongly recommend. For around $80 you get transport to Cancun, a private catamaran across to the Isla, about 1 hour to explore before getting back on the catamaran to go to dolphin discovery which included is a dolphin adventure swim. Then about an hour to explore dolphin discovery, chill out in the hammocks, go and see the sharks etc before boarding the catamaran once more back to Cancun and getting your transport back to the hotel door. On top of all this, all your drinks and food are included all day! This is a long packed day but worth it and is actually cheaper than just doing a dolphin swim trip! We also did the jungle speed boat tour which was great fun and value and we went to CocoBongo twice which is amazing, part Vegas show part night club with an open bar policy, well worth going! At the end of our holiday we discovered we had been delayed for 24 hours. This was dealt with incredibly well by our tour operator and hotel. We were notified via our room phone and were told to stay exactly where we were and go any enjoy another days holiday. Our wrist bands were still valid so everything was still included and we stayed in the same room we had all holiday while the tour operator organised a new transfer time and flight of which we were notified of in good time. Over all an absolutely brilliant place/holiday which I cannot speak highly enough of.

I had asked for two adjoining rooms on the third floor of one of the middle buildings, buildings 3 or 4. I had also asked for mattress toppers. All of my requests were fulfilled. Buildings 3 and 4 are in the middle, so they are quiet. The mattress toppers were a must as the mattresses are hard and due to be changed. There are little hallways that lead off of the main inner corridor of each building to each group of two rooms. This was great for a family as we were able to lock the door to the main hallway and leave our main room doors open creating a really nice space for all of us. The hotel could definitely use a renovation. The decor is dated and there was rust around the sink and the shower drains in each bathroom. This did not concern me because I was looking for a hotel that was clean, well located, on a nice beach with good food and the Riu Playacar was definitely all of the above. The service is very professional with everyone working exceptionally hard to please and the hotel and grounds are impeccably clean. We travelled with our three older teenagers and our five year old and there was definitely something for everyone. The kids club is not very extensive, but the animators try harder to get the kids involved than any other more elaborate all-inclusive that I have stayed in. The water in the pool where the swim up bar is was not quite sparkling blue, but the second pool was quite nice. The nightly shows were amateur but again the staff really tried hard to entertain. There was live music in the lobby often at night and that was a really nice touch. The food was great.....lots of choice in the main restaurant. After a couple of days we learned to look at the board outside the dining room in the morning to see what the theme was that night ( before making reservations at the specialty restaurants). There are three specialty restaurants, two a la carte that are outside near the beach, a Mexican and a Steakhouse. They have a nicer atmosphere at night as the lighting is bright in the main dining room and the asian restaurant. The asian restaurant is buffet not a la carte. In all cases, we found the food was great. Even with a vegetarian in the group there was something for everyone. All in all I would recommend this hotel for the location and the staff.

My husband and I travel down south at least once a year and have stayed at a number of resorts. This was our 5th. trip to Mexico and our 4th. stay in Playa del Carmen. We have always loved the area and still do. Due to special circumstances this year we were forced to book last minute and ended up staying at the RIU Playacar. Firstly I would like to say that the staff are outstanding. The food at the buffet was plentiful and well prepared. Unfortunately, the resort is old. The beds in the room are not only hard, but you will feel the springs. The pillows are so thin as to be non existant. We needed to use the extra blankets out of the closet only to find one with smears of something brown and the other smelling so foul that even the staff were revolted. The room was damp to the extent that the bedding always felt damp. We aired out the room everyday to no avail. When we arrived the room was full of mosquitos...we later found out this was because the screen door had been removed from the patio. We still took our chances with the mosquitos as it was the only way to get some air into the room (We did have one of the stray cats come to visit our room one day, it was outrageous enough to be hilarious!) The bathrooms are moldy, the toilet ran non stop. The rooms smell. The gym is not actually located at this resort. It is located two resorts down the road at another RIU resort. The pool with the swim up bar actually has yellow water. When you stand on the little bridge that crosses over the two sections of pool it is clearly evident that the urine level is very high on the sde with the pool bar the other side is a pristine blue....there is no washroom easily accessible for pool users (The only washroom in that area is beside the lunch buffet where you have to be wearing shoes, shorts and shirts). The fellas at the bar obviously felt the same way....they did not leave their stools at the swim up bar all afternoon. Hence the yellow water. The steakhouse and asian inspired restaurants are not worth your while. We didn't bother trying the mexican restaurant. I would recommend if you are going to stay at a RIU book yourself into one of the Palace resorts with RIU. It is truly a 5 star.

We enjoyed it so much that we returned again this year. We arrived on March 29th and departed on April 7th. The weather was mid to high 80's while we were there. It was a bit more humid this year but that may be because we were there about three weeks later than we were last year. It didn't really bother us too much, we just jumped in the pool or the ocean when we needed to cool down. Most of the time, there was a good breeze. We also seemed to have missed alot of the \"spring breakers\" that like to party a little heavier than we do! We especially enjoy the friendly and wonderful service we receive from the staff at this resort. They all work very hard and always have smiles on their faces! We usually ended our evenings at the lobby bar for a nightcap (or two) and really enjoyed the variety of music they had some nights, as well as our bartenders, Daniel, Froylann, Nancy, and Abraham.

We had heard that \"all-inclusives\" are sometimes not so hot when it comes to those things, but we had no complaints. As far as rooms, they are clean and maid service is good. For those of us who are \"light\" sleepers, it can be a little noisy in the early mornings. We didn't have any loud people in our building at night so that was pleasant. Pads for the beds are a must unless you like hard beds. We were a little disappointed with the quality of the pool (the section with the pool bar) as it did not appear as clean as last year. Most days the water was quite cloudy so we chose to spend our time in the other pool. On our last day, it appeared they must have done something to make it better but it would have been nice if they could have had it clear and clean for our entire vacation. The beach is awesome. Mostly yellow and red flag days while we were there, a little rough on the feet at times when you first entered the water, due to shells, etc. Water shoes would be a good thing to have!

We are a two 20-something professionals who have previously traveled to the Dominican and Cuba, so we have traveled enough to know what to expect from a resort and we chose the Riu Playcar both for the good reviews and the reduced likelihood of running into crowds of spring breakers. Below is a breakdown of what we experienced, in order of what was most important to us. The Beach: Cancun is known for its white sand beaches and beautiful turquoise waters, and that is exactly what you will get here. The sand is full of broken seashells that may cause some discomfort when walking and the waves were especially harsh during our stay, but we spent most of our time at the beach and loved it. There are some palm trees that provide shade to those who desire it, while the majority of the beach is uncovered and perfect for getting that tan you\u2019re after. The only drawback for us was the lack of a bar on the actual beach, which seems to be a standard for many resorts, so expect to trek a little to get your drinks. The aforementioned strong waves in the ocean did pose a problem when it came to swimming and I recommend parents of young children be cautious when letting them into the water on windy days, as the waves were downright violent at times. The Food and Drinks: Having been to Cuba and the Dominican, my expectations of the resort food were not extremely high, but I always found something I liked. The main buffet, adjacent to the lobby, is where we ate breakfast and dinner often and the food was good on the whole. There is a good selection of Mexican and international dishes, with staples you see every day and a few special dishes introduced on theme nights. Given the delicate pallets of many American and Canadian guests, the food is not overly spiced and you are given sauces and condiments to flavor the food to your liking. What impressed me most was how on-the-ball the staff seemed to be when it came to keeping food fresh and topped up. As soon as a dish was running low, there was a fresh batch right around the corner and this kept up until the restaurant closed. The only drawback to the main buffet is that it isn\u2019t open for lunch, only breakfast and dinner, so you will need to find your daytime sustenance at the other buffet, close to the beach, which offers mainly standard burgers, hotdogs, pasta, nachos and salads. Not exceptional but still very tasty and convenient. The resort also offers three \u201cthemed\u201d restaurants that guests can partake of; Asian, Steak House and Mexican. All three offer a fine dining experience and the food was good overall. The only downsides to the food was the death of good seafood, something my girlfriend and I were really hoping for, and the fact that the meat was often tough and overcooked. As for drinks, I was very impressed with the quality and selection of cocktails on offer at the lobby bar (open 24 hours), the pool bar that also has a swim-up section, and the main bar near the beach. The bartenders are well trained to make a variety of specialty cocktails and they also know the staples, and they are consistent across the board. A Pina Colada will taste the same regardless of which bartender makes it. If beer is your thing, Dos Equis flows like running water and it is also stocked in the mini-bar in your room, The usual caveat of bringing your own cup applies here as well, since the cups offered are fairly small. For teetotalers or the underage, a selection of soft drinks and juices are available, in addition to coffee beverages and tea. The Room: The Riu Playacar is divided into three-level villas and, given that this is a smaller resort, you will not have to walk far to get to either the beach or the lobby. The room itself is a standard room with all you really need, and while I do agree that the beds were a little on the firm side, I actually liked this and slept very well every night. The shower is rather small and lacks a light, but thankfully the water pressure and availability of hot water was constant throughout our stay. Every room also comes with a reliable safe for storing your valuables, a mini-bar stocked with soda, water and beer, and a liquor dispenser that offers tequila, rum, whisky and vodka. There is one think I need to strongly caution you about. The floors become incredibly slippery when wet and it is easy to slip and take a nasty fall, as I did, so be very careful when trekking water via your wet clothes or when stepping out of the shower. The other complaint I had is that the doors and walls do little to block out noise pollution from the hallways, so expect to get woken up repeatedly by rowdy guests and banging doors. The Staff: Most employees of the Riu Playacar start their days at the crack of dawn and they work hard to keep the grounds maintained, the drinks flowing and the guests entertained. I found them to be happy, cheerful and genuinely friendly, and to my surprise, they weren\u2019t just pining for tips as staff at other resorts seem to do. Tips are always appreciated but they are rarely expected or asked for, which definitely helped guests warm to them. The maids do a good job of cleaning you room on time and they are very talented with making animals out of towels, so there is usually a nice surprise waiting for you in your room every day. Equally hard working are the entertainment staff, who spend their days at the pool doing fun games and classes, at the beach entertaining guests and putting on nightly shows in the theatre. We attended a few of these shows, which range from comedy sketches to themed dance shows, and we were thoroughly entertained. In short, the staff were fantastic and special props go out to Felix at the swim-up bar and Rueben, the uber-flamboyant and utterly hilarious entertainment team member. You\u2019ll definitely remember him. The Excursions: Par for the course at any resort, representatives from your tour operator will be in the lobby booking organized excursions off the resort and we booked two of them that are especially noteworthy. The first was the Chichen Itza, which is an all-day trip to the fames Mayan ruins, and we had the good fortune to go during the first day of the spring Equinox. The second was the Jungle Maya, which was an adventure tour that involved swimming and snorkeling in natural caves, zip-lining through the jungle and taking a very bumpy off-road ride in a big 4x4. Both were well organized and run by fun and knowledgeable tour operators, and both excursions will give you a true taste of Mayan culture and history. However, this all comes with a big word of caution. When you get off the plan in Cancun and you are directed to a representative at the airport, speak with them and ask about the excursions you might be interested in. Not only will they give you some insight and advice, but they will also tell you the maximum price that you should be charged and this helped us avoid getting ripped off by our Sunquest representative who tried to overcharge us $20 for the excursions we wanted to book (he would presumably pocket the difference). The fact that they have the foresight to warn you against overpaying for an excursion obviously means that this happens often, so educate yourself before booking. Simple Advice: - Sunscreen, sunscreen and more sunscreen! Don\u2019t underestimate the baking power of the Mexican sun, as I did, or else you will wind up with a nasty burn, also as I did. - The general store in the lobby is a good source for sundry items you will need or want during your stay, but they are also overpriced. There is a shopping complex directly across the street from the resort where you can shop around, or take a taxi into Playa Del Carmen and see if any better deals are to be found. - Given that plenty of uninhibited travelers come to this resort, prepare to see some bare breasts on the beach\u2026both male and female. - The currency accepted at the resort is the US dollar and the Peso. Canadian dollars are generally not accepted, however you can do currency exchanges in the lobby and the rates are reasonable. - Avoiding making long distance phone calls from your room if you can, as the billing can go up to $5 per minute (no kidding). Use your mobile phone which has better roaming rates. The calling cards they sell at the resort also incur a service charge. - Given the tropical climate, expect to see bugs including some pretty ghastly looking mosquitoes. Be sure to pack bug spray and apply generously in the evening. Overall, my girlfriend and I have few regrets about choosing the Riu Playacar and we definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a relaxing holiday or somewhere family-friendly. As with any resort, people looking for things to complain about will find imperfections that satisfy that need, but modest people looking for something fun and affordable should definitely consider this place for their next holiday.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat Time--Here's some advice\u201d", "Author": "TravelFan48302", "ReviewID": "UR103542228", "Content": "Loved the location and the resort.

(coincidence by the hotel,we brits dont complain as much as some) 3 couples had no hot water for days,one couple had none for 7 days,and the maintainence man said just run it until it comes hot,it took 20 or so minutes,a waste of water. our room was clean,and cleaned daily,but it was far from perfect. the shower tray was damaged,and was clearly very old,the plug hole was loose and no light in the shower at all?? we had a mini bar/fridge and we requested pepsi light,and the lads did change it. the bed was like a snooker table,it took 3 or 4 days for our backs to get used to it,but it was clean ,apart from the throw on the top,which was filthy in places. the pool on the 2nd week was disgusting,you could'nt see the bottom,very cloudy,it should have been closed for health reasons,a couple who used it got mouth ulcers,so we used the beach. the food....there is the self service restaurant,and we ate here mostly,breakfast a great selection, and the evening selections varied ,overall a 9 out of 10. we went to the mexican restaurant one night and lets just say very average, food bland a score of 5 out of 10,(the mexican night in the self serve was far better) also we tried the steakhouse and very similar service/etc. again quite bland ,6 out of 10 from all of us. the bar staff canot do enough for you,we tipped them 20 peso's usually,and frequently,this got us good service,we especially liked nancy and enrique as well as abraham. when there you have to do the bar crawl with thomson,55 us dollars,and worth every penny. blows you away coco bongo's 10 out of 10. we were looked after by miguel and andy(thomson) and the made the perfect combination,(local knowledge and company experience) they were not pushy i seeling you trips,they explained them and said if we want any let us know. we went over to the tequilla to play pool 2 nights (sports bar) and the residents (kids) made playing pool almost impossible,take ear plugs if you want to brave drunk kids screaming,other wise stay clear, would we stay at the riu playacar next year, if the condition of the rooms was the same then no, but they might one day spend some dollars on the place. also lastly,we booked with portland holidays (thomson group) and they advised us to take mexican peso's with us,well we were given bad advice,take us dollars,every where takes them and you have to pay for trips in us dollars,so you get shafted on the exchange rate,also its better for you if you tip 1 dollar,as 20 peso is around1.6 dollars. hope this helps. john whitehead la duquesa andalucia spain", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing Vacation!\u201d", "Author": "troythetraveler", "ReviewID": "UR102569722", "Content": "Traveled with a group of 10, 5 adults and 5 teenagers. The Riu Playcar met all our needs. A smaller resort, 6 buildings, 3 stories high. Main Lobby is street front, 2 rows of 3 buildings, then restaurants, entertainment, pool, then beach. Rooms: We stayed in building 4, in the middle. try to get building 3 or 4, as it may have less traffic walking by. We had a middle floor, although we had requested a top floor, but 4 rooms were not available on top. slightly noisy at times, your room is only as quiet as your neighbors next door. most rooms open to a center open corridor, and the place is bustling by 8am. Beds are very hard. we had a mattress topper on our beds when we arrived so we didn't have to request one, but its still hard with the topper, and side sleepers will toss and turn at night! All rooms have 2 double beds pushed together. the bathroom has a curtain, then sink, closet, nice shower, and toilet with door. fridge with water, pop, beer, and a liquor cabinet dispenser. Small patio. We didn't have any odors in our room as some had in previous reviews. there is no ocean view rooms, buildings are set back a bit, and lots of palm trees, then beach/ocean. Food: Food was great! never tired of the menu. In main lobby is large breakfast buffet, something for everyone. Lunch is a buffet at Turquesa near pool/beach. taco station everyday, hot foods, cold foods, pizza, french fries, chips, pica de gallo, fresh guacamole. dinner is main lobby buffet again, they changed the menu every night. We did go to all the specialty restaurants, Turquesa which is the lunch spot, transforms to half steakhouse and half mexican at night. all great food. Jade is an asian buffet in main lobby. asian entrees and sushi. You have to make reservations for the steakhouse, mexican and asian restaurants at the breakfast buffet starting at 7am. reservations go fast! you need to be there a few minutes early to get what you want. seatings for dinner are at 6:45pm and 8:45pm. Lobby Bar, Pool Bar, and a Bar by the entertainment stage. the entertainment was not great, we walked by a few times at night to see the show, but never sat down to watch. There is a disco at Riu Tequila, and a sports bar there, went over there one evening. 2 pools, never crowded. we stayed on the beach all day everyday, got there around 9:30am, no problems getting chairs. Some palm trees for limited shade, or large open area near water. Great beach! activities all day, take it or leave it! Friendly employees, very clean, great location. 45 minute bus ride from airport. shopping area across the street. Starbucks, jewelry, clothing, misc. I would recommend this hotel, decently priced for a decent hotel.

The Hotel was just like the other Riu hotels we have stayed in, the rooms are in blocks set in beautiful gardens and were off a good size, there are two large double beds which are hard so when you check in ask for a matress topper which is free, there is a tv and clock radio. There is a large area with sink wardrobes seperate toilet and seperate shower room NO bath which my wife prefers, you get a free safe, iron and ironing board. There is a small fridge with beer, soft drinks and water, also optics with brandy, rum, vodka and whisky which are refilled every two days for FREE. The only problem we found was that the rooms are off a large a large open space in centre of each building which amplifid any noise which can be heard in your room. There are six Riu Hotels in Playacar and you can use the facilities of four of the other Riu's which is good for a change. This is the smallest of the Riu's so the facilities reflect this but it is quieter than the others and is set on a beautiful beach. Ther is free WiFi in the lobby area and laptops can be rented .The Thompson reps Andy & Miguel were very helpful, they told use its cheaper and very easy to use local buses ect,Miguel even drew a map so we could go to Cancun.The intercity coaches are great with free WIFi and tvs on board and his map showed us were and which local bus to use, 45 miles to Cancun and less than \u00a33 each. We booked to see the Mayan Ruins at Chiche'n Itza which was briliant with food and drink on the coach. All the other sites we used buses or taxis as they are very cheap, We went to the ruins at Tulum on the bus and had a taxi to Playa Del Carmen just ten minuets and got a ferry to the island of Cozumel and went on the Submarine Atlantis over the reefs Briliant.. We took a taxi to Xcaret big park on the coast were you can swim with Dolfins or Sharks plus loads more things to see and do.

We were 5 adults and 4 kids aged 9-14. We vacation at Carribean All-Inclusives every year and are experienced family travellers. This is also our third stay at a RIU and were not dissappointed this time. This resort is wonderful for families and older empty nesters. Food: Food was great. We're fussy eaters and found great selections of fresh meat and fish everyday. The buffets have enough variety to please anyone, and even include North American staples like burgers, hot dogs and fries. The grouper fish everyday was fantastic, and we really enjoyed the daily selections of mexican food. Kids loved the swirl ice-cream machine close-by the pool, available all day long. The Steak House A La Carte was good, Asian was good, but I'd suggest not to bother with the Mexican, as this food was available in the Buffet on Mexican night. Do not miss the seafood night in the buffet! Rooms: Large enough for family of 4 and very clean. We asked to change rooms (were a little too close to the nightly show) and also needed a toilet looked after - both were dealt with promptly. Nice towel animal surprises by maids from time to time, and cold beer and pop in the mini-fridge. Staff: Probably the friendliest we've encountered. Truly nice, from the maids to the bartenders and the Animation team were a load of fun. Mario and Ruben are a laugh. Remember that they don't make a lot of money, so tipping a few dollars here and there go a long way for them. Pool: There are 2 large pools, one is very quiet, the other has the swim-up bar and gets a little noisier. Nice to hang around in the afternoons to cool-off, but we spent most of our day at the beach. Beach: Spectacular. White powdery sand for miles and miles, beautiful turquoise water and fun waves for the kids. There is no under-tow, so very safe. Beach is similar to Punta Cana, but this one goes on much longer. There must be about 500 loungers available, so there was never any problem any time of day to get as many as 5 when we needed them, and dozens of palm trees if you preferred shade. Resort: Property was meticulously kept clean and the gardens are very beautiful. While this is an older RIU resort, they are constantly freshening it up and it has a little more mexican culture than the Palaces (too stuffy for our taste anyway). We visited Riu Tequila and Yucatan and found them to be covered in Jungle. Tequila is not on the beach and more the party place having a Disco. I think average families would enjoy Riu Playacar more than these two. While both Riu Palaces were gorgious resorts, I couldn't justify paying the extra few thousand as these are on the same beach. Location and Shopping: Riu Playacar is in an excellent location. All of the RIU resorts plus many others and private residences are in a larger secure Playacar Complex. There's a cobblestone road with sidewalks that goes one end to the other, into the Playa Del Carmen town (20 min. walk, or $7 taxi ride). Wife and I had beautiful walks on this road every morning - lots of joggers and other walkers (very safe, day or night). There is a shopping plaza directly accross the street from the lobby of the hotel. Fun to walk through, but too expensive to buy from. Best prices for silver jewelry is from the vendors on the beach. Cheaper than in town too. You can pay as little as $10-$25 for heavy bracelets and necklaces on the beach. If you are looking for a relaxing holiday in the sun and on a beach, with a little bit of culture and fun, this is perfect for you and your families.", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat time at the Riu Playacar\u201d", "Author": "luv2travelCanada", "ReviewID": "UR101314803", "Content": "First impressions are everything about the Riu Playacar.

The resort is small, which is actually great because everything was just steps away. It is right on the beach, as well as shops and a Starbucks right across the street. The food was good and we definitely enjoyed eating... you can pretty much eat all day long, there is always something open. We did not, however, like the Asian restaurant at all (except for the fried ice cream). It was, in my opinion, similar to what you would find at the mall food court, maybe worse. The steak restaurant was excellent though and I would highly recommend asking for more chimichurri sauce, it was delish! They also have a Mexican restaurant, but since at the buffet there was always different selections of Mexican food along with American food, we never ventured to try that restaurant. The staff and the service are excellent. Everyone is so nice and so helpful. The beach is so beautiful, and my daughter had a great time jumping in the waves. The pool areas are small but even in the midst of spring break season, we didn't have too much trouble finding a chair. The resort is quiet and it seems like mostly older couples and some small families were staying there. It was a great option to be able to visit the other Riu resort pools and beaches which are all just a short walk from the resort. The drinks were great and I never had a bad one! Our favorites were mojito, pina coladas, and bloody mary. All excellent! We didn't even take advantage of drinks in the room mostly because we were mostly out enjoying the outdoors and getting drinks at the bars. When we got there, we had a standard room but were surprisingly upgraded to a suite which was great. I think that even if we had a standard room it would have been fine because we spent very little time in our room anyways. A suite was perfect for the three of us though, it gave us a great amount of room. The TV was a flat screen, though we did see in other rooms they had the older tube TV's. The beds were slightly firm but none of us thought they were too firm and we all slept quite comfortably. WE were on the first floor in the last building next to the bar and pools so at night it did get a little loud, but easily drowned out with TV and almost always everything was quiet by 11pm. We never had to complain about noise. If you are sensitive to noise and people walking by, then second floor and one of the middle buildings would probably work better for you. Overall, we really enjoyed the laid back, casual atmosphere. There are scheduled activities, but we didn't take part in anything... it was really great to just relax and eat and drink and relax some more!

The staff was awesome and didn't hesitate to satisfy our request as soon as a new room was available a bit further away which was nice and quiet. The beds were hard but I understand that is pretty much the norm in Mexico. Request a mattress pad (I just used the extra blanket int he closet and that made a huge difference). The Starbucks across the street was a lifesaver!! I had read there were no coffee makers in the rooms so we actually brought a small coffeemaker all the way there only to find out there is no cream to be found anywhere!!

The rooms are nice enough but the mattresses are very firm (think prison bedding) and the pillows are too small.

This was our second Riu (having stayed at the Bachata in Puerto Plata last year) and highly recommend this chain to anyone travelling south. The Playacar is a smaller hotel than most other Riu's but we found the facilites and service to be stellar. The resort consists of six separate three story villas which gives more of a feeling of intimacy than high-rise type hotels. The rooms were kept close to immaculate (as well as the lobby, buffet, grounds, pools, a la cartes) with staff continually cleaning every spot of the place. The beds are hard as many other reviewers have stated but our beds already had foam toppers on them when we arrived and it wasn't an issue. Televisions in the rooms are the old tube style so the age of the resort shows a bit but we spent probably 2 hrs of the entire week watching our TV. The bathroom is just curtained off from the main room with a corner shower and separate doored bathroom for privacy. Not an issue at all, just a little different than normal. A mini bar is restocked every two days and we hardly put a dent in it because we spent so little time in the room. We were on the top floor and had no issues with noise from adjoining rooms and slept fairly soundly. The food at the Playacar was fantastic with plenty of choices every night for supper with several different entrees available each sitting as well as staples that were always there. We never tired of the food and always found everything cooked well, flavourful, and hot. Desserts were also awesome with a chocolate fountain there for dipping fruit, plenty of cakes, pies, ice cream (cones) for everyone's taste. There are three a la cartes and we did only two, the asian and the steakhouse. The Jade was still buffet style but the food was great. Steakhouse was a sit down meal and the sirloin we ordered was also tasty and tender. Again, great service! Every evening there was a decent show to watch including Las Vegas, Mayan, Grease, Michael Jackson themes. Lots of dancing, lots of seats available, great bar service! Before every show the animacion staff had guests come up on stage for embarrassing and/or funny games. The animacion staff were all friendly, entertaining, and engaging but didn't pressure you to join in if you didn't want too. Avoid the beer chugging contest.... it's fun at the time! There is also air gun, bocce, horseshoe, beach volleyball tournaments for those active enough to participate. Watersports such as sailing, kayaking, and boogy boarding are also available. Most importantly..... the beach is gorgeous! Powdery white sand that goes for miles and tons of lounge chairs available with the option of sun or shade under plentiful palm trees. It's a 20 minute walk to 5th Avenue in Playa Del Carmen for shopping along the beach and we did this a couple times. Five bucks will also get you a cab ride there from the hotel. Across the street is more shopping for those not interesting in venturing too far but the prices are higher than 5th Avenue. On two nights local vendors set up displays along the main path between the villas inside the hotel complex. It was even more pricey so know what the local souvenirs are worth before buying. The pools are a bit smaller than the other Riu's in the area but we could have used the facilities at the Tequila and Yucatan as well if we didn't live at the beach much of the day. We did eat lunch at both of the above but found the buffet lines longer and selection smaller than at the Playacar. The vendors selling excursions across from the hotel could be haggled down quite a bit from the posted prices and we did the ruins of Tulum and Coba for about half the advertised price. Never heard of anyone being burned by these guys and we had a great time on our excursions. To sum it up we had a great time at the Riu Playacar and would highly recommend it to anyone. The price is excellent for the quality and service you get here. We felt like we were pampered for a week! Playa Del Carmen is beautiful and there is plenty of activities both onsite or nearby.", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot a 5 star Resort !!\u201d", "Author": "Disappointed154985", "ReviewID": "UR97349573", "Content": "With the exception of a few employee's at the resort the rest of the employee's could not care less.

The Jade restaurant was an extremely pleasant evening with brilliant food and service. The location on the beach and within walking distance of Playa del Carmen makes it ideal to ring the changes on your 'to do' list. Senor Frogs - a bar on the beach at the ferry terminal is a must if only for the experience as a very friendly welcome is extended to one and all. A cheap taxi ride to Playa is another option if exercise is off the list. If there is a down side it is the behaviour of some of the American customers who were much too loud for our tastes but then each to their own.

The water is very clear with a sandy bottom, it gets deep quick and there is an undertow. Huge beach with plenty of chairs. The majority of the food was above average.

The lunch buffet was average, but we only ate there once, so really can't say much. Tried the 3 \"specialty\" restaurants. The Asian was decent as was the Steakhouse, probably the 1st decent steak I've had in Mexico. The Mexican was not good, so we didn't finish our meals. The bar service was excellent, they do serve the drinks and beer in tiny cups, so you meed to bring your own glass. We used 24 oz insulated cups and they worked great. They would make the drinks as strong as you want, so I don't understand the reviews about weak drinks. We also tipped a buck or 2 every few drinks. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Always smiling and pleasant. There are plenty of activities to participate in and the activity directors did a good job of letting you know what was going on. The rooms were clean, you need to ask for a mattress topper, typical hard beds. We stayed in one of the center buildings, so it was fairly quiet. We would definitely stay here again.

The trip from the Cancun airport was a bit long for my taste. Our plane landed by 1:00 and we arrived at the hotel at 3:00. Make sure you bring some snacks because you will have a late lunch on the day of your arrival. The hotel was beautiful. Everything was kept clean and the landscape beautifully manicured. We received wonderful service from housekeeping and the front desk. As soon as we were in our room we requested a mattress topper, because yes the beds are very firm! We had it in time for us to turn in for the night. There is a strong sulphur smell in this area and even in the room. We found plugging the sink drain helped a lot! The beach was great! Lots of powdery sand and lounge chairs. What was really nice was there were no noisy jet skis or boats in the water. Also, I think we encountered a vendor/peddler only a couple times and he pleasantly took a no thank you for an answer. We had access to the Riu Tequila and Riu Yucatan. Both are within walking distance. They were both beautiful and seemed to have their own different attractions/landscaping from the Playacar. We took a cab into town for $5 and walked back to the hotel. We felt very safe staying in the tourist area. You can also walk up the beach into town, which takes about 30-40 minutes. For those concerned about exchanging money, most places nearby and on 5th avenue take US dollars. There is a place across the street from the Riu Playacar that will exchange it to Pesos, if you'd like. Be smart and always use your room safe for all your valuables! We went on a bus tour to the Mayan ruins in Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. It was a very long and hot day, but I definitely recommend it. These ruins have recently been named one of the official new 7 wonders of the world. The food at the resort was good, but not amazing. So unless you are a very picky eater you will find something that you like at the buffet. The selection is wonderful. We did eat at the Mexican restaurant one evening and it was very good. We had no trouble making reservations around 9:00 a.m. The drinks were great and endless, of course. Be sure to bring your own travel cup. They will gladly fill it for you! I do wish I would have done better research before booking a trip for this time of year. We only had two days of sun out of five. The other three days were cool, cloudy and/or rainy, (but since it was snowing back home at the exact same time I'm not complaining!). I've been watching the weather for Playa since we've been home and it's been off and on rain and clouds. Someone at the front desk said the weather is much better there in March.

We chose this hotel for the smaller feel, great price (we booked 9 months in advance), and the nice looking pool and beach. This hotel lived up to everything we could have wanted for our vacation. The staff was very helpful and courteous for our entire stay, the pool and beach were beautiful, and it was a relatively quiet resort. Perfect for a relaxing vacation. The room was pretty good. The bed was extremely firm, but we took care of that issue right away and called for a mattress pad. The only big issue we encountered were small ants in the room. Some people might freak out and demand to switch rooms, but a little bug spray from the hotel staff, and we were good to go for the rest of the trip. For the food, at least it was available all day. They had everything you could want (pizza, chicken, salad bar, etc.), but if you want my advice, stick to the Mexican food; I thought it was fantastic! And make sure you wake up in time for breakfast! The pool was amazing. They had 2 pools; one for relaxing, and the other \"party\" pool. The party pool had the swim up bar, played music most of the day, and had activities. We enjoyed the beach, but eventually gravitated more towards the pool as it was nice to have the drinks and food a little closer. The hotel entertainment staff was fantastic! Consisted of a group of young guys and girls, who were always friendly, constantly engaging and thoughtful, and overall very funny. What I liked best was that they tried to get you to join in their activites (volleyball, darts, water aerobics, and even a beer chugging contest!), but were never too pushy. And they usually did some sort of show at night. The hotel was in a decent location. There were some nice little shops right across the street for shopping (and even a starbucks!). The hotel staff said Playa was about a 30 minute walk from the hotel, but we made it in about 20 mins. We felt very safe for the whole walk, as it is mostly tourist walking around.

First let me say that we visit the RIU Playacar yearly and have never been disapointed. About the only things that needed improvement were the weather and the ability for me to stay up as late as I would have liked to. Don't think I will have much luck changing either. Our weather last year seemed a little strange and that was the case in Playa del Carmen also. The days were partly cloudy and in the low 70's but the evenings cooled down enough to keep the pools from warming up. We booked our own transportation this year using USA Transfers. Made our reservations online and paid our driver at our destination. I would definately use them again. Private transportation with no stops on the way to your hotel. Check-in was quick and the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was very nice. We had one of 6 rooms on the 3rd floor that have a view of the Carribean. Our room was cleaned daily and a new towel animal when we returned each afternoon. We did ask for, and were given, a cushioned matress pad because the matress was on the \"firm\" side. The most noticeable change at the hotel was the beach area. There was a great beach once again. Over the last 5 years the beach had been disapearing more each year. Last year the government undertook a huge beach reconstruction project and has it made a big difference. Last year the water was up to the neighboring hotel. Now I would quess there is over 250 feet of beach. You can walk to Playa del Carmen without getting wet. The food was good as always. We enjoyed the Jade (Asian) restaurant. Estaban and all the other dining staff do a great job. We spent some time at the pool bar and were always treated great. Osvaldo, Nelson and Enrique kept the glasses at the bar La Cumbia filled.

From the moment we arrived until the moment we left nothing was too much trouble for the hard working staff at this hotel. The hotel is made up of six blocks.We stayed in the pink block (nearest to the beach) on the ground floor. We had two adjoining rooms which shared a communal porch area which could also be closed and locked at night.The rooms were spotlessly clean.Each room had two large double beds,a large dressing area/bathroom and a minibar. The minibar had four optics (white rum,dark rum,vodka and tequila) and a fridge with beers,coke,sprite,fanta and water.Each block had an ice machine and an icebucket was provided in the room.The minibars were routinely restocked every two days or by request. The rooms were spacious and more than adequate for a family of four. The main restaurant had a large variety of international foods.We honestly can not fault the food.We ate in either the main restaurant or on three occasions we used the steakhouse speciality restaurant.The hotel also has an Asian and a Mexican speciality restaurant which although we didn't use we only heard good things about.Also during our stay we also had the option of a lunchtime beach barbeque. The bars were well staffed and we never seemed to queue for a drink. The local beer Dos Equis went down a treat and the cocktail list was extensive! Twice a week on mexican street there would be stalls selling local painting and souvenirs. The communal areas were large and spacious and immaculately kept. The reception staff were courteous and professional and everything was dealt with quickly and efficiently. The hotel has two large pools a \"quiet \" pool and the main pool which houses the pool bar and is also the main setting for the daily activities.Ther is also a kids pool and a jacuzzi spa. All communal areas around the pool were immaculate. We never had any trouble getting a good spot around the pool. The animation team were fantastic.Our children had never attended a kids club before but they loved it.Mario and Ruby were fantastic with the kids organising all sorts of activities both in and out of the pool.The kids clubhouse was ideally located near the pool so we could keep an eye on them.Every day at 10.30 (when the kids were in the kids club) the pool bar staff came around the pool with Pina Coladas and the trademark Strawberry Daquiris.The rest of the animation team hosted a whole host of activities from rifle shooting to beach volleyball.they came around every morning to ask whether we wished to join in but didn't take offence when we said no! The beach was fabulous!The kids tried cayaking,snorkelling and bodyboarding (all non motorised watersports were included) However I would say that there was quite a strong undercurrent whilst we were there and we made the kids wear the life jackets when they were in the sea even though they can both swim. The evening entertainment took place in a partially open air theatre. It started with the kids disco and games and then there was a different show every night.Despite what previous reviews stated we missed the Michael Jackson tribute show!! The Riu Playacar is in a gated community made up of hotels and private villas. There is a manned security gate at either end.Opposite the hotel is a small shopping plaza with a chemist,gift shops,coffee shops etc.We took a taxi into 5th Avenue on a few occasions. The taxi cost approximately \u00a32.50 each way.5th Avenue is a long promenade of shops with direct beach access with a great assortment of shops,bars and restaurants. You can also book excursions here .I was concerned it would be unsafe to leave the complex but it wasn't and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a trip to the silver merchants. The quality is fantastic and the prices are approximately a third of what you can expect to pay in the UK. There is also a Walmart nearby where you can purchase suncream and beach inflatables for a fraction of what it costs in the shopping plaza. We booked an excursion to Chitchen Itza in house with our rep. Although we paid a little bit more the tour guide Victor was superb.The trip was \"all inclusive\" with croissants and coffee for breakfast and frequent soft drinks/beer. I cannot say enough about this hotel. I was told before we travelled to stock up on anti-diarrhoeal medications as this was a common ailment in Mexico! I would like to say that not one of us suffered any sort of upset tummy for the whole holiday. On one occasion the hotel manager stopped at our table in the restaurant to ask how we were enjoying our stay. My five year old mentioned she had seen a mosquito (a fly!!)The manager promptly asked for our room numbers and when we returned from dinner the room had been checked and sprayed. It was also our wedding anniversary whilst we were there and we returned to our room to discover a tray of chocolate coated strawberries compliments of the manager.We were also presented with a mayan figurine by the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone especially those travelling with younger children for the first time to Mexico. We had a fabulous time and if we hadn't already booked our holiday for this year we would be back at the riu playacar", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "missouri", "Title": "\u201cAbout that water....?\u201d", "Author": "tiger_i", "ReviewID": "UR94202219", "Content": "Stayed for 5 nights in January, 2011. We were well-treated by staff at all levels from hotel management, to restaurant management, to pool staff, cleaners, bus persons, bartenders, wait staff, at all times, and all were as helpful as could be. I can assure you that these folks aren't paid nearly well enough for the services they perform. I was most impressed by the wide variety of clientele; Americans, Canadians, South Americans, Brits, and almost any country you'd care to name in Western Europe were represented. The room was not exceptional; adequate size for a married couple with decent drawer and closet space. There is an in-room safe located in the closet, a wetbar with tequila (Cuervo Especial) , vodka, and two types of rum (all off-brand), and a mini-fridge with 4 bottles of beer (Dos Equis), 2 large bottles of drinking water, and several flavors of soda. The bathroom mirror is clearly marked with a \"NO POTABLE\" sign above the water faucet. Air conditioner worked well - we actually got a bit chilled our first night. There were a couple of glitches with housekeeping; no bath towels upon arrival, but the situation was corrected promptly. Another day, there were no wash cloths, but again, when it was brought to their attention, it was corrected. Buffet was better than average and the fare varied nightly. The buffet was divided into 3 areas; pasta/pizza in one area, Mexican fare (chips/salsas/cheeses) in another, and a different meat/vegetable selection each night, in the third. In addition, 3 other restaurants (steakhouse, Asian, and seafood), all of which required reservations for one of two seating \"sessions.\" Location was OK; I would have preferred to be a bit closer to La Quinta (Fifth Avenue) and the ferry pier for shopping and a side trip to Cozumel. It's just a bit short of 2 miles, so too far to be considered an easy walk. Cab rides cost $5 and that was just fine. With that said, it was very convenient to the Riu Tequila, where we partied a few evenings in the Sports Bar and ate lunch one day, and Riu Yucatan, where we lunched one day and used the gym facilities. There is a shopping area directly across the street with a Starbucks, ATM, clothing, souvenir, and a internet/camera/video store. My camera went out on a side trip to Tulum, and I went to replace or recharge the battery. The proprietor didn't speak really good English and my \"Spanglish\" is horrific, but we were able to deduce that he would need 24 hours to get a replacement battery, or could sell a recharger (recargador). The latter worked just fine although it was a bit pricey. Lesson: make sure your backups for your electronics are with you at all times. All things considered, I would give the Riu Playacar a straight-A report card, EXCEPT The day before checkout we returned to our room from the beach and found a puddle on the floor, not near the bathroom or sink. We sopped it up with a hand towel, went to dinner, and returned to a larger puddle. OK, it was raining, and the roof is partially open, probably no big deal. The morning we checked out; NO running water! Uh-oh! We reported to the desk and were told it might get fixed in a couple of hours. Unfortunately, the bus to the airport left in 1 hour. So, we checked out without taking a shower.

It is part of a compound of 5 RIU resorts including Riu Palace and Riu Lupita. -Service and food are excellent - fresh, lots of variety. -Staff are happy - always smiling and there seems to be good morale. -Rooms small but clean and well decorated; nice bathrooms with marble and separate water closet/toilets. -Very accessible for shopping (Playa del Carmen) and XCaret etc. -While small (total of 8 3 story buildings) we found it noisy. the housekeeping staff start cleaning at 8;30 am and due to the construction of the buildings with interior open courts, the echo and noise can be considerable. Bring ear plugs. -Beach crowded and noisy - either you get the cha-cha music from the pools (which are adjacent to the beach), the volleyball courts or near the water the boats and see-doos. And there are wide areas that you cannot use as they are path-ways to drag down the catamarans and other watercraft. -Beach itself is okay - long so you can walk for miles; swimming is only average - it can be windy and wavy alot of time and there is a strong undertow that keeps carrying you sideways. They have marked swimming areas accordingly but most people only go out 5-10 or so yards. -Pool: same problem - the <quiet< pool is an extension of the activity pool area where they play loud music. -Very small lobby bar about the size of a large kitchen island with seating for 15 max. The alternative is the bar in the main outdoor restaurant which you cannot talk in because of the noise from the adjacent stage where they put on movies and animation shows for kids. -Drinks are okay; seem to be watered down and served only in small juice size glasses. -I agree with the other reviews - the wine is awful. We found a liquor store at the top of Playa del Carmen that sells a wide variety of good wines. If you are wine lover like us, i would suggest you go there your first day and stock up. Bring your own wine opener - the hotel does not supply one for the room which means bringing the bottle to the lobby bar. -Alot of families with small children.

For families with small children or elderly, this may be a challenge. There was always alot of people waiting for the doors to open for dinner.

First impressions were that the resort was beautiful, clean, colourful and well laid out. The hotel is in a great location, easy walk into Playa and 5th avenue (even with 2 children aged 9 and 10). Didn't need a taxi back either. We all felt perfectly safe and is well lit and clean. The beach at the resort is amazing, warm, clean water, but drops to waist deep quite quickly, but waters fairly calm, with not much of a current (only one red flag day in 2 week vacation). The beach also had a cooling breeze, which meant we didnt need the shade from the palm trees. There is no bar on the beach, but to be honest you didn't need one, as only 2 minute walk up the sand to the bar. We took 52 oz bubba kegs with us and filled them in morning and they lasted all day - bar men happily filled them for us. Sand is soft and not shingle. The pool was a lot cooler, but was refreshing sitting in the water at the swim up bar - the cocktails are yummy, especially the mango daiquirie :-) (even husband was addicted). Plenty of sunbeds around pool and on beach until about 11 am, then got quite busy, although the pool was always a lot quieter. Plenty of shade around the pool. It is also protected from the breeze, which means it gets very warm in the sun there. Pool and beach towels are available each morning from 8 am. The food was good, lots of fried food, which got a bit sickly, but I still chose to eat it, rather than the assortment of fresh fruit. Lunches were a bit to similar, but not a major issue, and certainly not worth being negative about, overall the food was good. Red wine with dinner ok, white wine like paint stripper (very chemically, so best avoided!). The rooms are laid out into 6 blocks each 3 storys high. In my opinion, it wouldnt matter which block you stayed in as it only takes about 1 minute to walk from 1st to last. We stayed in block 5 which is the lilac block nearest the beach and theatre. we stayed on the middle floor (which is classed as the 2nd floor). This was the main element that let the hotel down, as the walls are so thin we could hear EVERYTHING, all night! The entertainment finishes at 11 but being from Britain, adjusting to the time difference meant that we were in bed much earlier. We could hear all the entertainment, as if the window door was open, and could also hear every person walking up the stairs and talking, often shouting or being rowdy. If we were to go again we would opt for the yellow colored building, as it gets the sun in the evening and is a little bit further from the theatre. It would also be worth requesting a room at the end of a building so that you are away from the stairwell (this is only applicable on the middle and upper floors). The beds although not as hard and uncomfortable as some people have suggested, were incredibly tiny, as we had 4 in one room, there were 2 in each bed, and honestly not big enough for 2 adults to sleep comfortably. Also the head boards bang against the walls when ever you move in the bed - even the kids turning over caused this. The lack of sleep during the night was combatted by a margarita induced siesta on the beach most afternoons :-) We would go back, but would book 2 rooms and make sure the location was different. All the staff were fantastic and very helpful, especially Edgar in the restaurant. and apart from the noise and lack of sleep we had a fabulous vacation", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cWe really liked the Riu Playacar\u201d", "Author": "mntraveler3", "ReviewID": "UR91202267", "Content": "I feel compelled to write a reveiw since I really value the opinions of others before me. To start with, check in went very smoothly. They don't have electronic keys - just the old fashion metal kind. They only will give you up to two keys per room, which is not always good because I was sharing this room with my two adult daughters. The safe in the room was very small - we were hoping to be able to put our laptops in, but that was not possible. Now the worst part about the Riu Playacar and then the rest is all uphill! The beds! When we walked in, it didn't even take me to sit down on the bed to wonder if the bed was only a box spring (with the springs bulging in places) After sitting down on it, I still couldn't decide if it was just a box spring - very hard. I had read about the beds being hard so we just called room service and asked to a foam topper. They might be limited in how many they had because they didn't bring enough for all of our beds the first night - just our room. To continue on with the beds, they were very small - not quite as large as a full size bed here in the US and they had a plastic mattress protector on so every time you rolled over, it sounded like you were on a plastic air mattress. Not only that, but they had a plastic like beadspread on top so I was surrounded in plastic. ICk. I have read that the rooms smell bad...yes they sometimes had a litle funky odor - but hey - this is a very humid area. You didn't notice the aroma once you had been in the room a few minutes. The showers were to die for! They had wonderful pressure and lots of hot water. There were only curtains seperating the bathroom area from the bedroom, but it worked out fine. I also read that someone said the wall were very thin. I am a very light sleeper and I never heard a sound after we went to bed. Maybe there wasn't anybody in the next room? We really liked the food - I even will go as far as to say it was the best I have had down there and this is our 3rd AI that we have stayed at in the Riviera Maya.

(Took a cab back once for a $5 cab fair) The beach was wonderful - the pool clean, but cold - didn't really see a lot of people in the pool. The drinks were better in the lobby than down by the pool, but we don't drink much, so I really can't comment on quality. The kids liked the free internet in the lobby and didn't have any problems with it. I didn't notice it was slow. The gym was at Riu Yuk. which was a 10 or so minute walk away - but it was pretty full at most times. The entertainment was very good if you could stay up to watch it! We would stay here again.

Cons: Very hard beds - follow others' suggestions and request a mattress topper. Small rooms and small beds. Fine for a family wiith young children but would be cramped for a family of teens. Wireless access available only in lobby and very slow. Service sometimes spotty - we requested a folding bed and had to repeat our request about 4-5 times before it was finally delivered. Pool was cold - however I would imagine that since it's quite hot there for most of the year, probably none of the hotels have heated pools. Just a heads up.

If you are expecting a 5 star hotel, you will be dissapointed. If you are expecting a 3 star, with average food, entertainment, and amenities, then you will be satisfied. Location The hotel is about 45 minutes south of Cancun airport and the ride there is rather bumpy. However, the hotel is located (along with 2 other Riu hotels) in a large gated community including a small marketplace, residential homes, and a golf course. The area is very nice and has a great \"exotic jungle\" feel to it that I'm sure you can't get in the main Cancun hotel strip. It is close to several popular excursion sites, as well as 5th avenue- a quaint little cobblestone street lined with shops, restaurants and bars. We walked there on the beach from our hotel. Rooms/Cleanliness The rooms were nice and had everything we needed- small t.v., patio, large bathroom (with a regular door--some others complained about a curtain dividing the bathroom and the room, but this wasn't the case), mini fridge restocked as often as you request containing sodas, water, and beer, 4-bottle liquor dispenser, safe, ironing board, hair dryer. The patio only had a view of another building, but we didn't go there to stay in our room all day so we didn't care. The bed and pillows were quite literally hard as a rock, so if you are picky about this you may want to bring your own pillows. I heard that you could ask for a bed topper, but we never did. We never saw one bug in our hotel room, and the maids kept everything very tidy for us. They left us a towel animal on most days. The other parts of the hotel were very clean as well, though we never got in the pool so we can't attest to the cleanliness of it. Food/Beverages The hotel offered a buffet breakfast and lunch, and either a buffet or specialty restuarant for dinner. The breakfast buffet had an excellent variety of food and drinks each morning (7-10:30). The lunch buffet was the least impressive, with a smaller selection of options (due to its location in a smaller building) and usually luke warm food (served around 12 pm-4pm). The dinner buffett was very good, with a variety of options( served around 6pm-10pm). For dinner you also had the option of eating at a specialty restaurant (asian, mexican or steak house), but you could only make a reservation for these dinners the day of, at breakfast between 7-10:30am. Thus, if you are a late riser you might not get to make a reservation. We only made a reservation one night- for the steakhouse. It was very nice food-- still not 5 star quality, but defintely better than the buffet. These specialty restaurants are not separate buildings, but rather they are set up in a part of the lunch buffet area, and the food is brought basically at the same time to all the tables that have reserved for that night. The one very dissapointing thing for us was that the 24-hr \"snack bar\" that the hotel claims to have is actually just a popcorn machine with old popcorn in it and nachos and cold cheese dip like you would find at a movie theatre (but worse). We were slightly offput by having to time our meals to make sure we didn't get hungry at times when there was no food available, but it wasn't too bad. There were three bars- one of which was a swim-up pool bar. The pool (and the pool bar) closed at around 6 or 7 pm, which was a bit disappointing. However, the main big bar was open until 12am and the lobby bar was open 24 hours. The only beer that they had on tap was Dos Equis lager, which was fine by me because I like it. I never asked if they had other types of bottled beer. They have a somewhat limited bar selection, but they have enough to make a variety of drinks- mainly ones you've probably never heard of, so be sure to ask them to make you something new. They did have some higher level liquors such as Johnny Walker Red label and Bacardi Superior. Just be sure to ask for a higher end liquor if the quality matters to you. I have to say that my boyfriend and I did suspect that the liquors were watered down, because we drank a lot and did not get as drunk as normal. Perhaps it was the effect of being on vacation, or eating so much, or something else. However, we wern't really bothered by this because we enjoyed being able to try a lot of different drinks and still make it through the day without being too wasted. Entertainment There was something going on each night we were there, and if you participated and drank a good amount, the show was decently entertaining-though nothing to rave about. They also had a couple activities throughout the day like bartending class, water volleyball, etc. Water Sports There were kayaks and some other water activities to use in the ocean, and they were being used constantly-you had to time it right to be able to get there and use one when they were available. Beach The beach in front of the hotel was very nice, white sand, and nice water. There was a thin line of rock/shells right when you stepped into the water, but smooth bottom after that. When we went (I believe it may have been the end of hurricane season) there was a lot of wind and clouds, so the water was fairly rough. Thus, in the first few steps going into the ocean the water was a bit cloudy from the sand being turned up. However, after that and as far as we could see, it was a beautiful blue color. We also never had a problem finding a lounge chair on the beach. There is not much shade on the beach available (which didn't bother us at the time). Nightlife The hotel did not have much of a nightlife scene (maybe because it was still off season and not too many people were there?), but you can walk to the hotel Riu Tequila (which caters to a much younger crowd) and there is plenty of people hanging out and a dance club. This was free as you are free to drink at any of the three Riu hotels within the gated community. Overall, like I said, the hotel is an average 3 star hotel with nice rooms but hard beds (normal for Mexico hotels), average buffets and some nicer dinner options, decent entertainment, average drinks, etc. The best part is how relaxing the place is, but its hard not to find any hotel relaxing when you don't have to be at work and you have an all inclusive package. :)", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kankakee, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cVery relaxing trip\u201d", "Author": "JLRWilliams85", "ReviewID": "UR89958021", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Riu Playacar for our anniversary.

The rooms were clean and the staff went out of their way to meet your needs. The grounds were kept very nice and they had just decorated for Christmas during our stay.

A lovely, smaller, All Inclusive, on a terrific beach and with the nicest, friendliest, most hard working staff ever. I was ready for the hard bed and was primed to ask Housekeeping for a mattress topper, as advised by previous reviewers, but when we arrived, there was already one on! As a result , we found the bed extremely comfortable. My only gripes were 1) The Riu Playacar has the thinnest walls of any holiday accommodation I have ever stayed in. Because of that we had to adapt our lifestyle to suit that of our near neighbours, who retired around 9.30pm/10pm and rose at 6.30 or 6.45am - a time of the morning I usually consider to be the middle of the night back home! 2) The lobby bar is a wind tunnel on a chilly evening (we had a few in our second week)and very uncomfortable with hard, cast iron 'garden' chairs. The other bar down at the theatre was too loud for conversation, with activities going on. We found the lobby bars at the Yucatan and the Tequila considerably more relaxed and comfortable. 3) We thought the evening entertainment was terrible! But being tired out by 10pm and mindful of our early rising neighbours, we were usually in bed by the time most shows started! Hardworking ents team though. All in all a great holiday with some minor blips that didn't overly affect our enjoyment of this terrific resort and country.", "Date": "December 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery clean and very hard working staff.\u201d", "Author": "ptemere", "ReviewID": "UR89818651", "Content": "We hadn't been to Cancun in over 5 yrs and were a bit worried about what this Riu would be like.

The grounds are beautiful and lush for such a small resort and are intelligently laid out for easy navigation. We loved the buffet which served a variety of different food everyday. We ate the steakhouse and the mexican ala carte and would recommend both, we did not eat at the asian as they served an asian theme at the buffet one night.

We all had a fabulous time. Our 3 daughters aged 7,10,and 13 said it was the best vacation ever. They absolutely loved the RIU Playacar. My husband and I had stayed at the RIU Yucatan last year and we also really enjoyed the Yucatan, but after reading the rave reviews about the Playacar and their kids club we deciced to try the Playacar and we were not disapointed. From our first day to our check-out everything was perfect. The reception staff is fabulous especially Aldo, he always had a big smile and personal greeting for our family. He even went out of his way to find our family in the dining room on our last night to say good-bye, which we thought was very special. The food was fantastic and even our 3 picky eater daughters loved the food. There is always a great variety of foods to choose from from breakfast to dinner. We did not try any of the specialty restaurants as our family was very happy with the variety of foods at the buffet. As we are a family of 5 we had to get 2 rooms for our family which worked out great. We had side by side rooms and we all felt very safe. The rooms are very spacious and were always cleaned to perfection everyday by the cleaning staff. Our bar fridges were stocked everyother day with coke, sprite and orange as well as beer. I had seen all the complaints about hard bed matreses, and yes they do have firm matreses this was not a big problem for our family. We have stayed in hotels which the matreses were so soft you rolled into the middle. I would take the firm matress over the soft rolly matress. The pool area is fantastic, there is a busier pool and a quieter pool. Both pools were warm and spotless. There was always lots of pool side lounge either in the sun or shade, so no need to get up early to save your chairs as we did when we stayed at the Yucatan last year. There is only 1 swim up pool bar in the busier pool, but there was always a place for us to sit down. Felix the pool bartender was great, always a special drink for eveyone in our family. Our girls loved his chocolate milkshakes. The entertainment crew is unbelievable..fabulous!!! We had such a great time with all of them. There is lots to do from 10am- 5pm. The crew is not pushy at all, they will ask you if you want to be involved and if you say no then they will leave you alone. The night time shows were OK, we have seen better, but we have also seen worse. We travelled between the Yucatan resort and Playacar for entertainment and daily activities. We found that the Yucatan is much busier and louder than the Playacar. The Playacar is great for young families, and older couples. The Yucatan is more of a party resort. Our family did a couple of excursions as were sought out at the airport and agreed to attend a time share opportunity in which we got free and discounted activities. This was our first and last time share experience. But on the good side we got free ferry tickets to Isla Mujeres, and we got to see Isla Mujeres free by golfcart. We also got discounted tickets to Xcaret which our children really wanted to go to. Xcaret was great but very expensive for a family of 5, even with the discouted tickets!!!! We also took a cab into 5th Ave Playa Del Carmen, $5.00 US dollar each way, a 4 minute cab ride or 30 min walk. If you want great deals and a variety of mexican goods this is the place to go. The goods are much cheaper here on 5th Ave than they were with the sidewalk venders that come into the resorts. The beach infront of the Playacar is fabulous compaired to last year when there were the black sand bags trying to save some of the beach, but they have all disapeared and the beach is big and spectacular. We would highly recommend the RIU Plyacar for your next family vacation or quiet/relaxing getaway. If you are looking for more activity, excitement and night life I would recomend the Yucatan.

It was beautiful and smaller to where we didnt have to spend the day finding our way around. Our room wa snice and clean, had a balcony facing the walkway. had a mini bar in room and also a stocked fridge. we left a note asking for pepsi light and that day it was filled. Also everyday had a new towel animal waiting for us. There is even a clothes hanger for your wet clothes out on balcony. The first night we ate in the buffet and we were wowed, as the buffet opened the staff apraded around the lobby singing and clapping and dancing to let you know i was time to eat, as we walked in there were colored lighted ice sculptures and more ice sculptures inside, the food was beautifully displayed with carved fruits, melons and such, food was very good also and the best was there was a chocolate fountain with all kinds of fresh fruit and marshmallows. We also loved the bars, The bar by the theater was great, our first day Adrianna introduced us to Tequilla Slammers. We thought it was a fun way to start the vacation. Very fun, The pool bar was great also, during the day I swear Felix really gave you the alcohol, wow. My favorite was the mango daquiri, I suggest you give it a try. The pools are beautiful and fun, never had any trouble finding a chair. The staff were always trying to get activities going and if you chose not to participate they left you alone, And of course the Beach is the best. plenty of chairs, you could either be in sun by ater or in shade under palm trees, the only bad part is if you want by the water you had to drag your chair there. There is no drink service on the beach or pool, I highly suggest you take a Bubba Keg or Tervis Tumbler, they are more then happy to fill them for you, they keep you drink cold or frozen and you dont have to take so many trips to the bar. If you are thinking about a massage go and personnaly ask the staff at the hut on beach, because I did I got a promotion price of $40 for a 50 minute swedish massage. It was great! We enjoyed the food everyday. Breakfast buffet had many choices, they do not have made to order omlet station, but did have omlets available and made, Lunch buffet was good in reg buffet and also in the snack bar where we ate lunch every day, Snack bar also had soft serve ice cream, nachos and popcorn available all day, They do have 3 restaurants that you have to make reservations for by 1030am, we only tried the steak house, it was excellent and a fun experience. we went into Playa del carmen 2 times. Taxi was $5 each way. I think it is about a 30 minute walk. Fun place to go. Also took ferry to Cozumel one day, you can your tickets from Best Day rep in hotel lobby $22 both ways and it saves you from having to stand in line at the terminal. Ate lunch at La Mission there. I highly recommend, food is great and experience is fun, they have live music and take photos of your group in sambraros. We used the prearranged transportation services with best day. Next time we will take a private taxi, had to wait a while before we departed airport and then had to drop off other people ant other places and then on the way back to airport had to be picked up 4 hours early. By the time we got through security we had 3 hours to kill, that made it a very long day. The only other issues were the hard beds. I have read this before and thought people just liked to complain. Well they were the hardest beds Ive ever slept on. Next time I will find out if there is a pad I can take or rent, We have decided that we like the playacar so much that we will probably make it a ritual.", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Hope, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for families with children\u201d", "Author": "esbigpapa", "ReviewID": "UR88874394", "Content": "Just returned from another great vacation at a Riu resort.

And best of all was the entertainment crew. They put on great shows every night, including a pre-show for and including the kids which was a ton of fun for all. They even did their very first \"big production\" of Peter Pan, complete with aerial acrobatics. It was awesome. I have to give special notice to Mario and the daytime kids club. Our son loved him, and Mario was great with all the kids. He kept them so entertained. The food was good, as it always is at a Riu, although by the end of a week it can get a little repetitive.

There was a mini bar in the room which consisted of a fridge stocked with local beer and soft drinks. There were also optics in the room. These were all restocked every other day. The main restaurant was large and airy with clean linen, crockery and cutlery. The waiters were attentive filling the water glass at regular intervals. The breakfast buffet was varied, if the same every day. However, there was enough choice to eat a different meal each day. The lunchtime buffet was similar. Plenty of choice which would satisfy even the fussiest of eaters. The Main evening restaurant had themed nights ranging from Mexican to the gala dinner. There are also three other restaurants to choose from. A steak bar, Asian and Mexican. Going this time of year it was low season so the Asian and Mexican were held on alternate nights but they both operate simultaneously during the high season.

We had a wonderful time! Flight there was great as well as the transfer to the hotel. The trip in was a little long due to a detour because of construction. Check-in was seamless. The room was nothing special and the bed was hard...even asking for a mattress pad and two more pillows! We knew this going into the trip from reading the reviews on Trip Advisor though so it was no surprise. The air conditioning worked well and the maid service was good especially after a few tips! This hotel doesn't have purified water but they kept us stocked with plenty of bottled water all week. Overall the room, lobby and restrooms were very clean and well kept. We never noticed a bad smell other than the normal scent of the Mexican Yucatan! They do have wireless internet in the hotel lobby, but it was \"hit or miss\" as far as working or not. That being said, we were able to access it every day...we just had to try a couple of different times. Breakfast and dinner buffets were great. Lunch wasn't as good, but we could always find something (we love guacamole and chips) to eat. The Riu Playacar had three a la carte restaurants. They were OK with the steakhouse being the best and Mexican a close second. The Asian place was not very good and was a buffet in disguise! There wasn't much for sushi here so don't get your hopes up. Something you might like to know is that you could wear shorts to dinner as long as they weren't ripped or a bathing suit. I packed pants and dress shoes but was happy to find out that I could wear flip flops and nice khaki shorts! Drinks were great and they provided a better brand of liquor if you asked (Smirnoff, Bacardi, jack Daniels). One bad note here....the wine was AWFUL! No problem though, we went to Walmart and bought our own! Hola to Enrique, Dani, Polo and Froylan! These guys are great whether you tip or not...but a few dollars over the course of the trip make your service \"extra\" special. The beach was awesome! There were plenty of palm trees to get some shade from the sun when you needed it. We never had to play the \"towel game\" as there were always plenty of chairs. Pool was small and saw a lot of action everyday...so you can imagine, it wasn't very clean. We stayed out of it because the beach was so nice! The entertainment staff tried hard to keep everyone involved and overall all of the hotel staff were great. The Apple Vacations rep was very helpful at the hotel. After we told him we were not interested in any excursions, he showed us all of the places he recommended in town (his name was Roberto). We could go to two other resorts....Riu Yucatan and Riu Tequila. The Tequila isn't on the beach (it is across the street). The Yucatan was right down the beach and an easy walk. Our hotel seemed to be older than these other two and their pools were much larger. We could eat at both of these but only breakfast and lunch. Food was the same at all three so we only ate there once or twice to get a change of scenery. They were all great and fun but I would rate the Yucatan first, Playacar second and the Tequila last (no beach!). Of course, I didn't see any of the rooms in the Yucatan or the Tequila. Don't get me wrong, I loved our resort...but the Yucatan just seemed like it was newer or it had been updated recently. The shows are OK and there is much more atmosphere at the Riu Yucatan and the Riu Tequila....just take a short walk to either of these. The Playacar area is very safe at night to walk around. Downtown Playa was great and we enjoyed the fact that it was more \"laid back\" and \"less commercialized\" than Cancun. It was a $5 cab ride from our resort. Go to Walmart to get your coffee, vanillia, tequila, sunscreen, snacks, etc. Very safe and MUCH, MUCH cheaper! Overall we had a great time!

Also we went to Coco Bongo which was a good night total madness fro start to finish, my favourite trip was to Akun Chen where we went zip lining through the jungle, cave walking and snorkelling in the under ground caves (cenotes) we chose this place instead of the bigger Xplor park as Xplor is man made. I would recommend mexico to anyone but go for longer than 7 days which is not enough as we found out", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cwhat a great getaway!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "possum7", "ReviewID": "UR80975206", "Content": "The Riu Playacar is quite nice. All the staff were very very friendly; some were on the quiet side-perhaps they didnt speak much English, but everyone was nice. All the staff were immaculate and uniformed. The beachfront at this establishment like all of Playa's beachfront is perhaps the most beautiful there is, and this was certainly no exception. The pools were very warm and clean. All the food was good, and some of it was absolutely the best it could be. The a-la-carte restaurants I could take or leave- the buffet is really that good, and I would like to add that I never get any stomach problems when I stay at all inclusive. If you have had the astounding stomach trouble for a few days on a trip to Mexico you know what Im talking about- enough said. You will not get sick here. All the ice, water served for drinking etc has been purified. The minibar has water, soda beer etc, and there is a liquor dispenser with typical booze. Anyone who thinks there is a musty smell must be a first time visitor to Mexico. As soon as i step off the plane there is that dark, aromatic, mineral smell that is at once a smell and a feeling that says Hola! This is Mexico you are smelling near the sea with tropical climate, humidity and all. It is normal and to be expected. Room was nice, not brand new but nice- and 100 times better than some other hotels in Playa. All in all this was an incredible value as it was on sale thru Apple Vacations. 7 nights all inclusive, airfare nonstop from Chicago, airport transfers in Mexico, truly all inclusive for $741.00 per person final cost. Yeah Apple! I do however tip the maids, and the luggage bellman etc. Bring some $1 bills along and use them accordingly. If you want a fancier resort with fancier food, bidets, etc its all right there up the street at other Riu resorts and non Riu as well, however you will PAY higher for these. I was told by some Holland travelers that this was the nicest between this, the Riu Tequila, and the Riu Yucatan as they had stayed at each one. They emphatically preferred Riu Playacar. The only thing I found odd was the sometimes 'frenzy ' at the buffets. I think perhaps some people are frustrated or overwhelmed when confronting so much food and some of the \"ladies\" especially so. All in all I would recommend this at once. You have no idea what goes on in the kitchens at some resturants in some countries. Their standards of cleanliness are not the same as at home, and are not tolerated well by some stomachs, however Riu Playacar has excellent, excellent and clean eats.

The beds were firm, but okay for sleeping. We liked the ability to adjust the AC and the room also had a ceiling fan. The service at the reception area was friendly and attentive to our requests. The service at the bars/dinning areas and housekeeping were also very friendly and accommodating. The gounds were always clean and beautifully groomed. The beach has wonderful white sand and the water was warm, however a little rough- expected for this time of the year. Still okay for swimming and wave jumping, but not for snorkeling off the beach. We enjoyed most of the food and there was something for every taste. We walked over to the Rui Tequilla and rented bikes for a very reasonable cost and rode into Playa del Carmen-only a couple miles away. Also, there are stores across the street from the hotel lobby with some good deals to be found if you don't want to walk or ride into the city. There is a golf course in the neighborhood if you enjoy golf.

The evening entertainment was brill it started quite late and the kids entertainment was repeated, but the staff who did the shows clearly worked hard and were very good.

Sometimes it can put you off but our experience was so good we had to write a review. We took our two small children so a hotel needed to be up to scratch for us to stay there. Transfer time to hotel is long - dont be fooled and a lot of it is stop and start but it is worth it when you get there. The hotel is SO clean and we have never seen so many cleaners around a hotel. There were people cleaning from morning through to night and the hotel and grounds were spotless. Checked in with no problem all reception staff speak really great english and were so helpful. The resort is a lovely size and you are never more then two/three minutes from anywhere. We stayed in block 5 which was perfect. The room was a typical room you would expect but absolutely spotless. The only down side was the view but that did not spoil it for us. Beds were fine - please do not worry about the bad reviews saying they were rock hard. We spoke to so many people whilst there and we never heard 1 person complain about the beds. Air conditioning is brilliant and at times we had to turn down as it was chilly :o). Food is very important to us with two small children and it was lovely. Nothing we had over the two weeks looked under cooked, was cold or left hanging around. The amount of food that was replenished was unbelievable - again didnt speak to anyone that had tummy problems. But be aware what you are going to :o) food is lovely but will be repetative on occassions - this was fine for us but again some other people would class this as bad. Now to the people who work there. Again we have never ever been to a hotel where ALL the staff, and seriously we mean all the staff are so happy and friendly . Special mention to Raul in the restaurant, Dani, Enrique and Polo at the bar - please if you are going soon tell them Sam Sam said hi :o) Entertainment is around you ALL the time so if you want to go for quietness spend all your time either down the beach or at the quiet pool. However saying that the entertainment team are brilliant. They again are so friendly and like to involve you. Special mention to Mario, Ruben, Alex and Rubi - if you dont want to get involved they wont hassle you like other hotels we have been too. Beach is fab. Much cooler than the pool but the sea can be rough. We couldnt let the kids go in on there own but they were content with building sandcastles and chilling. Finally be prepared for the heat - it is hot and humid and you need to be prepared for that. A quick tip we got some factor 80 out there as for kids 50 just didnt cut it. Overall we loved this holiday and we would definitely go back which confuses me as to why there were so many bad reviews.

We felt it was money well spent. This is a small resort, which is what we prefer. Easy to get around with one path leading from the lobby to the pools, rooms and beach. The last time we were in the area the beach was small and full of sandbags. Now the beach is wide and no sand bags to be found. You can walk north up the beach all the way to Playa Del Carmen or south until you hit the rocky shoreline. They have a beach grill, an air conditioned buffet and three A La Carte restaurants. The lunch grill had lots of choices and offered fish tacos and coconut ice cream everyday! The breakfast and dinner buffets were also very good with lots of fresh fruit and grilled meat and fish. We went to the steak house A La Carte. It was fine, but we preferred all the choices at the buffet. We've been to several resorts in the Riviera Maya and felt the RIU had one of the best buffets we've been to. We were worried about the air conditioned buffet being too hot this time of year, but were happy to find lot's of ceiling fans and a comfortable temperature. The service at the resort was excellent. Everyone was very pleasant and helpful. The dive staff were especially great. They would thank you for diving with them after every trip. Their rental equipment was in very good condition and their dive boats were roomy and comfortable. The pools at the resort were nice, but the water temp was very warm this time of the year.

LOCATION: Everything is absolutely faultless. The location is second to none and one of the best out of the local hotels as it is closest to the beach. I'm not a huge fan of spending lots of time on the beach but its right there so you can take a 5 minute walk and take in the gorgeous view, the turquoise water and golden sand. There is a little booth serving smoothies and fresh fruit juices as you walk onto the beach which is great and when you are sitting round the pool you still have the great view. It is landscaped brilliantly, there is a quieter pool and then the one with the swim up bar and where all the activities take place. The beach is just breathtaking, I would strongly recommend JET SKI'S so much fun and worth the money, parasailing is also fun and kayaking is also worth a go as it is free! The sea is warm but can get quite choppy but as long as you stay where you can stand up it is lovely for a little dip. Layout of the hotel works really well, no matter what block you are in you are always close to the lobby and the pool/beach area, the walkway is simple and the gardens are nice. It\u2019s in my opinion better than the Riu Tequila as this is not only a lot more crowded and a bit more \u2018tacky\u2019 with the nightclub and sports bar and you are also a good 5 minutes from the beach and the rooms are really spread out which is not idea. The sports bar is nice though for kids of a quick drink and it is air conditioned which is something the Riu Playacar lacks. Riu Palace is nice, but it doesn\u2019t have the homey feel, you feel immediately at home at Riu Playacar which I think is essential because you could really relax and enjoy it rather than worrying about looking good all the time(not to say that Playaca is less classy! But you get what I mean!) ENTERTAINMENT:The entertainment staff were absolutely fantastic in particular MARIO (head of kids club, which is also fantastic providing lots of great events for the kids and they sometimes do a show before the main show involving the kids, I helped out in the mini grease version and it was fantastic) and ALEX they are always so upbeat which really makes you feel in the holiday spirit and the games that were put on were always a good laugh especially water polo, and beach football and volley ball. They work really hard and you can\u2019t fault them, although I will say if you have a teenage daughter I would keep a close eye as a lot of them are very 'flirty' and some seemed to be a bit hazy with boundaries, but 99% of the time they are fantastic and work very hard. Shows were mostly really good, and the ones were the audience joins in is good fun, karaoke was also on and was done really well. The bar in the theatre is great and it\u2019s not hard to find somewhere to sit. Every other day at night there are stalls along the walkway, if you say 'mas tarde gracias' which means 'later thank you' they tend not to bother you. Water aerobics is great fun and done really well and the parties afterwards on the beach are VERY good, and highly enjoyable even if you don\u2019t really like/can't dance ALEX, MARIO, RUBEN, EMILIO, RAFAEL, JUAN and RUBI they all really made our holiday! FOOD: Food is first class, the bbq's once/twice a week are really good, the buffet every night in the main restaurant is amazing and there is always lots of variety. Lunch is very samey but still really good and perfect for a light lunch, the Turquesa restaurant (where steak house/Mexican and lunch is served) is brilliant, views of the pool and beach and plenty of room. We only used the Mexican speciality restaurant and it was great. Breakfast is out of this world definitely recommend the ham and cheese omelettes! STAFF: Bar staff and waiters are very friendly and so happy to help. The lobby bar is open all night and is good for a quick drink. Before dinner there is often some entertainment in the lobby... Mariachi band or salsa dancing. People on reception, cleaners, everyone is so friendly and obliging which really does make a difference. ROOMS: Rooms, really good, aircon works great, sometimes even got too cold! Bathrooms are spacious, plenty of coat hangers, powerful shower, good range of TV channels, rooms cleaned really well and nice touches like towel sculptures were added and sometimes chocolates and sweets, especially if you tip, which is recommenced. About $2 every other or something similar and they really look after you, and they deserve it! Yes the beds are slightly hard but it didn\u2019t bother me you can ask for a bed topper, these make a big difference and are very comfortable but not essential. TRIPS: We did not personally go on any, although we wanted to, but there are lots on offer and I have heard good review from people I met about the Coba trip, the Dolphin Trainer and Xcaret! 5th avenue is worth a look, I thought it was brilliant and unfortunately I left it to my last night to go and if I hadn\u2019t I would have definitely gone there more, there are also shops directly outside the hotel with a bank and a drugstore, we brought a mosquito plug from the drug store and this really helped because that is one of the only problems you do get bitten a lot, but the plug really helped. All in all 5*, the only fault is that the bedding is a bit outdated, but that is it! Highly recommend giving ping pong and other activities a go, they are fun and you can win a prize like a hat or t shirt.. I found this very exciting! Although my team always seemed to lose! There's always next year! Seriously, ignore the petty bad reviews it is a holiday of a lifetime, you will love it, there is so much to do and it is somewhere I will definitely go back to. Not only is Riu Playacar fantastic but you will just fall in love with the Mexican culture and location, excellent!

The beach was nice, the water really isn't that pretty blue I was expecting. The ride from the airport is an hour, so If you are going for a short trip I would stay closer to Cancun. The hotel is nice I would say a 3 1/2 star. They do serve really strong drinks-not stingy with the alcohol at all. We had to tell them to cutt way back. The grounds are always kept really clean. The staff works hard to keep you happy. They also try to keep you entertained. They are pretty funny. The pool gets dirty by the end of the day but that is to be expected with that many people. The buffets are really good and lots of variety. Always was presented very nicely. We ate the steakhouse and it was really good too. Remember the steak there is not like the US, its thin and a little tough. We did not like the Asian resturant at all, as a matter of fact we got up and left and went to buffet. The rooms need a little updating. The beds are very hard but if you get a pad its not too bad. The rooms don't get very cold which is really important to me since its so hot and humid there. They are pretty roomy. Would like to see cable and T.V's updated but not that big of a deal since your not in your room much. Right across the street is a little shoping area that is very convinent. Be sure to bargain with them, they will go down on the price. Since it rains there everyday be careful not to fall because the floors get very slick- I nearly wiped out and saw other people fall. We went on the Chetzchen tour. It was fun ziplining through the jungle the caves are pretty but the cenotes was not very good. The lunch they served was very good. Overall the trip was alot of fun and the vacation is always what you make of it. I probably won't go back to Mexico because the water is just not that pretty to me.

They are always happy to help, always make you laugh, the activites were fun and alway enteraining. the shows were always good and the entertament would always make us smile. the bar staff was always nice and friendly and willing to do anything, the only thing with the bar was they would run out of three of our parties drink (Pernod) nearly every night and never had a back up of it. the managment was willing to do anything they could to help you. it was a member of our groups birthday and when i spoke to them they oraganised, champange, birthday cake, and celebrations around the pool and in the resturant that evening. the room were very comfortbable and sapcious and clean. the food was the best food ive ever had in a hotel and the service was always good the whole hotel was 5* it is amazing and cant wait to go again next year! i would just go back for the anmiation team they were the best part of the whole holiday!", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cTwo days at RIU Playacar\u201d", "Author": "theucfan", "ReviewID": "UR75920916", "Content": "I had been in Playa for two weeks at a spanish language school.

But, the beach is beautiful, shade under the palms if you want it or full sun. Lovely sand and the ocean was so warm. Great walks in either direction. I did a 2 mile beach run to the Cozumel ferry and back one morning which was terrific. I didn't even go in the pool, but it looked nice. The grounds are immaculate and the tropical plants are great. Little agoutis (sort of like tall guinea pigs) and tropical birds were great fun to watch. The food was good and I am not a buffet person normally, but the selection was very diverse. I was especially happy that there were Mexican foods available at every meal as well as more European/American fare. The drinks were not watered down and easy to get. Most of the guests are European, a fair number with children, but lots of couples or adult families as well. It's very peaceful and I never noticed any obnoxious or drunk guests while I was there. The rooms are fine. I didn't notice any smell, which some people have said and our AC worked fine. There were some mosquitos, but it's the tropics, what can you do? The walk in shower and separate toilet closet were nice and I personally slept like a log on the hard beds. The lobby offers free wi-fi also. We went cenote diving one day which was very cool and creepy, watched the 10 year old on our trip swim with the dolphins and went over to Cozumel for a day of scuba diving.

There are two main pools, one where most of the games are played through the day and a second, quieter one. Both are well kept with plenty of pool space to either have fun with other residents playing the well organised games or a quiet swim on your own. Pools can get warm at the end of the day but that can happen when you have such great weather 32 degrees +. Service was good where ever you went with all the team willing to put themselves out to help you. Location can not be beaten. Great beach with easy walks along it to either go into town if you turn left of see a bit of wild coastline if you turn right. The small improvements that could be made is that the entertainment at night could get repetitive (a themed show with the same dance group most nights). You can go to two other local RIU hotels to break things up but as an all inclusive package it would be good to see a bit more variety.

We knew ahead of time that it was a long drive from the airport, but it was a really LONG drive. Our plane arrived 2 hours late, so that put us in to the hotel at about 9pm, which shot our first day. Upon arrival our folio was ready and we were in our room within 10 minutes of check-in. No one offered to take our bags to our room, probably due to the later hour. No problem though. The Rooms: We stayed in building #3 on the ground floor, room #3114. Our room was very clean, the fridge was stocked with soft drinks and three very large bottles of water. It did seem very damp and musty, but there was no obnoxious smell that others have reported. We did bring a plug-in air freshener, but I think it was not really necessary. They provide small foil packets of soap and shampoo so bring your own. THE BEDS: If you're capable of sleeping soundly on the ground then you'll just LOVE the beds here. If you're like me, and require a little softer mattress, ask for a foam mattress topper at the front desk when you check in. (They have very thin ones and very thick ones. Ask for a VERY THICK one.) I'm not sure why a hotel chain as big as Riu doesn't get new beds when this is the #1 complaint on Trip Advisor. Also, they do not have King beds, they have two doubles pushed together, so if you want to snuggle with your honey you'll have to sleep on one side or the other. With the exception of the beds, our room was perfect and very clean. The Food: We ate most meals at the buffets. Just a minor gripe here and it probably won't bother most of you. The dining room off the lobby is more or less air conditioned. It seemed warm to me, but it was bearable. The other outdoor dining room was just plain HOT. I don't care to eat when I'm sweating but I toughed it out and the food made up for it. Very delicious and different each day. We ate in the reservation-only steak restaurant one night and the service and food was excellent. Don't forget to make your reservation at breakfast before 10:30am in the main buffet dining room! The Pools and Beach: Riu Playacar has two pools. Both were very clean. There is NO POOL DRINK SERVICE at this hotel. You will have to get up each time and walk a short distance to get something to drink. There are two bars very close though. One is a swim up bar. There were plenty of lounge chairs and it never seemed to be very crowded or too noisy. The beach was beautiful and clean as well. There are no umbrellas for shade on the beach, just palm trees with very little cover, so bring lots of sun block! We didn't partake of the entertainment but I don't think people come to this particular hotel for that. It's very laid back and quiet, a nice change from the Cancun hotels. If you're looking for a party, don't come to this hotel. If you want an enjoyable vacation with great food, awesome service, and a calm atmosphere, Riu Playacar is perfect. For the money, you can't beat it in Playa. We'll be back!

I'll try not to repeat recent reviews and let you know things perhaps omitted or different. We spent most days on the beach. Once or twice there was a drinks service offered on the beach. Once a week at lunchtime there was food and drink served outside at the entrance to the beach. Food was excellent. I didn't speak to anyone with an upset tummy. We tried all 3 speciality restaurants. Enjoyed them all. The buffet was excellent. There were about 24 tables outside on a verrandah.We always sat there. We were always served our drinks and coffee. There were a couple of cats that visited but they were no problem. Occassionally there were geckos on the ceiling here. When I say outside there was a high roof. In the Asian you could have deep fried ice cream for dessert. There are no tea making facilities in the room but there are Nescafe coffee machines which were tempermental. Also in the restaurant near the beach you could help yourself to Nachos and popcorn We asked for diet pepsi in our fridge and they were happy to provide this. We had a whole day of rain. They did everything to amuse us. They put up gaming tables in the lobby and moved the table tennis table there to. The was a book exchange by the towel shack at the pool and they moved these too. They also produced all sorts of board games. The shower was very efficient. I dislike the little sachets of shampoo and shower gel but that was my only complaint about the room. We were on the top floor of the pink block nearest the pool and the sea overlooking the next hotel and found it perfect. Sunny balcony in th morning. If you want something from the evening stalls every few nights do so as they are packing up to get a bargain. We never had a problem getting a sun bed but we are early birds. We lunched in the Tequila and Yucatan and had pre dinner drinks in them too,We preferred our hotel only because it was smaller. You can also have lunch at the beach club of the Riu Lupita which is up the beach the other direction. We walked the road into town. It was about 30mins at a leisurely pace. There is a Walmart there but we didn't buy anything. I'm sure it would be great for value if you were not all inclusive. Oh, and the great bed debate.

I witnessed a housekeeping supervisor running a finger around the outside of the sliding glass door to check for dust! Even the balconies were immaculate. The rooms appeared to have been recently updated. Bathrooms were spacious and the toilets were another \"best in the RM\". If you've visited Mexico before then you know how hit and miss that can be. Updated toilets and sewer systems are a definite luxury! Another resort just a stone's throw away still has a \"no paper in the toilet\" policy. Taste in food can be very subjective but we thought it was delicious overall. Lots of variety and something for everyone! It was better than most we've had in the area. The meats were seasoned and cooked perfectly, for the most part, which is a rarity! Drinks are the typical AI fare, which is to say they aren't great, but the margaritas on Mexican night in the buffet were delicious, so they can make a good one when they want to ;-) The beach is gorgeous, with lots of palapas and not much shade and the pools are adequate (nothing spectacular) with lots of both.

Location is ideal and right on the beach. Note there are no parasols on the beach just palm trees for shelter. The restaurant/bar/lobby areas are good and the service at front desk and everywhere around the hotel was excellent. The place is keep very clean and tidy and everyone takes great pride in what they do. Food:- Good choice with mixed menu to suit and cater for all nationalities. We always found something different to eat during our 2 week stay. Water:- Not convinced of the quality of the water in the hotel for drinking as both my wife and I suffered with upset stomachs for a number of days. Stick to bottled water from the start including brushing teeth. Drinks:- Whilst freely available I would suggest caution as far are cocktails particularly when mixtures of cream based ingredients are added. The heat and humidity are high enough for concern when it comes to cream/milk based products. Weather:- We visited between 19 June to 3 July and whilst the temperature was bearable, the humidity did make it feel very uncomfortable. Best time to visit would probably be in the high season around Jan/Feb. Also we encountered a tropical storm (Alex) which lasted for 4 days and made it difficult to get around. You can always borrow an umbrella from the front desk. Site seeing:- We visited Chichen Itza which was an interesting trip. Our guide was amazing (Rex) who had a wealth of knowledge and experience. A word of caution though, if you are visiting this great site particularly during the hot months, it gets very hot over 100F and there is not much shelter. Luckily our tour guide had arranged for umbrellas which were extremely useful to protect from the direct sun. People have been reported to faint due to the heat. Also wear suitable clothing to cover the neck and shoulder and take insect spray as there are horse flies which have quite a painful bite. Xcaret :- This was another amazing place we visited and thoroughly enjoyed it. Be aware that the tour operators will sell you the full day\u2019s package at around $99 per person which includes entrance and lunch. You can take the halve day option which we did and it worked out to $69 per person. There is an evening show which starts at 7pm if you like seeing traditional Mexican dancing. If you using a taxi to get back to your hotel, then buy your return taxi voucher just before the entrance to the park so that later on once the show finishes you don\u2019t have to queue. Taxis:- All around the resort there are excellent taxi services and from most hotels there are taxis waiting outside to take you around. From the Riu Playacar to Play del Carmen it is a $5 or 50 pesos ride to 5th Avenue. Here there are all the typical shops catering for tourists. You can also get a very good exchange rate to change $, \u00a3 or Euro into pesos. Probably better rate than most hotels will offer. Airport:- At departure two things to be aware of. A tax levy of $110 or \u00a338 per person is payable so make sure you have some money left over. Also for folks travelling to UK, if you exceed your baggage allowance of 20KG there will be a charge imposed of $20/kilo. You can carry drinks (water) including any local liquor in your hand luggage even before you go through to security so don\u2019t add any additional weight to your main bags by having liquor in you main case.

We got there around 11:00 a.m. and \"check-in\" wasn't until 3:00 but they had our room ready within an hour. They took our bags up to the second floor. We stayed in a junior suite in the pink building which overlooks the pool and has a view of Cozumel. The room was very pretty. We had a large swan towel animal on the bed swimming in rose petals when we got there. There was a large sitting area across from the bed with a sofa and chair. It was decorated very nice. There's a big walk in closet with six large cubes to stack your stuff in. This came in very handy since I brought too much stuff. The bathroom is nice with his and her sinks and a bathtub shower. There's also a refrigerator stocked with soda, beer and plenty of bottled water. They refill the refrigerator every 2 days but if you run out all you have to do is buzz the front desk and they'll bring you more. There's also a stocked bar above the refrigerator. Our cleaning lady was wonderful. She kept the room spotless and left us a different towel animal everyday. There's 2 large lagoon type pools at the resort. One is the quiet pool and the other one has a swim up bar with plenty of entertainment and games. We went back and forth between the two pools. There are a lot of actvities going on around the resort . They had 2 beach barbecues, swimsuit fashion show, cocktail class (lots of fun! - lots of drinks!), horseshoes, rifle shooting, ping pong, tennis, tequila volleyball, drinking games, scuba lessons, water aerobics and lots more. The beaches are beautiful. White sand and turquoise blue water You can walk all the way to Playa Del Carmen on the beach. It's breathtaking! They have jet ski's, parasailing, canoes, paddleboats and sailboats at the beach. There's also plenty of chairs at the beach and pools. The food is really good with LOTS to choose from. Lunch is served near the pool area and breakfast and dinner are up by the front lobby. They also have an Asian restaurant and a steak house. Our favorite was breakfast. French toast (yum), omelets (stuffed with ham and cheese), bacon and sausage, cereals, muffins and donuts, huge fruit bar and lots of fresh juices. Too much to name and sooo good! Good variety to choose from at lunch too. Dinner was different every night. They had Mexico night and Asian night at the buffet while we were there. At Asian night you can get the best sushi. They had 9 different types to chose from and oh so good. They always have a pasta station and a Mexican food station set up no matter which night you're there. There's lots of comfort food (potatoes and sauces and fried foods), lots of healthy food (grilled chicken, grilled fish/seafood, salad and fruit bars) and lots of foods in between (seafood, roast pig, roast beef, soups. If you can't find anything to eat then there's something wrong with you. Now to the staff - They're fantastic! Alexxx and Dani will joke around with you at the bars and make you the best drinks. If you need more alcohol in your drink, don't complain - just ask. They'll do you up right. Be sure and ask for the electric lemonade. The bar tenders work very hard and they really have a lot of fun with everyone. You'll make friends with them the first day. The animacion team is unbelieveable! (A big shoutout to Super Chuie) They not only entertain everyone with the games throughout the day but they also put together the shows at night. There's a Michael Jackson show, a Burlesque show, a crazy couples show (we had to get on stage for this one - don't be shy!), Mayan show etc. You need to see each show at least one time - it's worth it. The staff at this resort is by far the best I've seen. They really want you to have a good time. WE LOVED OUR VACATION!

Overall, not bad. Nice Buffet restaurant in the Lobby area which has A/C.. Rooms are logically laid out.. six buildings, 3 on each side, 3 floors in each.. they reside between the lobby and pool area... makes sense. Beach area is beautiful and vibrant with activity.. but... no true shade which can be a notch brutal for a full day out there. Pool area. Not bad.. but .... water was extremely warm and the pool didn't appear to be kept clean .. at least not to my standards ( little algae, etc) .. Never saw them truly cleaning it or chlorinating it... and there were a LOT of people in there.... Bars... Hmmmmmm.. Pool bar, one in the food area near the bar, and one in the lobby . They lacked one down by the beach. This is a major snafu' IMHO. One more reason the beach are lacked.. whether you wanted water, sodas are adult beverages... nada' Bathrooms. MAJOR issue IMHO. None by the beach. None near the pool ( you getting my drift????) .. you had to dry off and go to the food are to use the small bathroom. If you were down by the beach.. you had to walk all the way back. Service. Hmmmmmmmmmmmm... in the food areas..... basic and average.. no real complaints. BUT.. none by the pool. none by the beach. Hell, none during the shows!! .. You had to walk to the bars, every time, for the little 6oz glass they gave you .... THAT , is one of my main issues with this hotel. Food. Ok. Not a lot of variety day to day, but a lot of choices among what they put out. I can't bash this... just nothing over the top, ever ....... just food..... Bedding. Room was ok... notch musty ( wife brought air freshener ).... but beds, as most I've found .. SUCK. Had them add a pad. Still .. SUCKED... never got a good nights sleep...... God my bed felt good when I got home last night! So, overall.. not bad. I just didn't think it was a good value. I heard that kids stay free, so for families it may be a good value. For me, for what I spent, I could have done better. However, I was in a group and the value for me was being with our friends.... and due to that ,was a great vacation. I just would go again, unless the price sucked me in .. and that wasn't the case this time around.....", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stinkbridge", "Title": "\u201cSuperb you miserable lot !!\u201d", "Author": "amjw", "ReviewID": "UR68585797", "Content": "Just got back from Mexico, had a great time at the Riu Playacar.

ALL of the staff are wonderful and friendly, nothing is any trouble to them, you are so well looked after, especially at meal times, the food here is really very tasty and of a high standard compared to other RIU's where we've been and experienced bland and tasteless meals. You can have lunch in the RIU Tequila & RIU Yucatan but dinner must be eaten here, our hotel was much better to eat at. There's always a 'hola' whenever you pass any of the staff, they do a trmendous job and these RIU chains are well-oiled machines. The hotel and surrounding pool and eating areas were spotless throughout, there's no shortage of sunbeds by the pool or beach, the entertainment staff work tirelessly to make it as fun as possible and will try to involve you in anything that's going on - Mario & Reuben were so funny and energetic, just watching them tired me out !!! 5th Avenue & Coco Bongos are worth a night out, we ate at a very nice Italian there called 'Da Gigis', it just made a nice change from eating in the hotel. Coco Bongos is great too and puts on a fab show, with time to party in between the acts, its worth paying extra for an 'Express' pass as you get ringside seats and a personal server all night, so much fun we had, brilliant, I didn't even like Tequila before we went !!! Oh and just one thing, for the mosquitos we found a spray called 'OFF!' which is available at the shop in the lobby, it worked brilliantly at keeping the little blighters away !!

I loved my 8 nts stay at the riu Playacar. Yes of couse, if I had wanted to pay more money I could have stayed at the Riu Palace, but that was my choice. I know the Palace hotels has the WOW factor. But for this trip the Riu Playacar was more what I was looking for. I did go an tour around and was extremely happy with my choice and would recommended it to anyone who is looking more for a smaller and quieter hotel ambiance. Food at any of the Riu hotels is always excellent. My only recommendation for all the Riu Hotels, they need to spend a bit more money to upgrade their spas, gym water sport activities and kids clubs. This is to keep up with their competition. But overall, I still came home as a very HAPPY RIU client and will keep on going to other Riu properties.

This is one of six Riu hotels in the area and in my opinion we picked the right one. It is the smallest and therefore retains a personal feel, the staff are very friendly and helpful. We visited the Riu Tequila and the Riu Yucatan both were much larger, busier and noisier. The food was lovely, anyone who knocks the choice of food here must be a fussy eater, we found it very nice and with a bit of imagination not too repetative. 10 days was just right for us as the weather was very hot and the humidity very oppressive at times, 34 degrees at 9.30pm one evening! The hotel is getting a bit of a makeover at the moment, but this is being done unintrusively and does not interfere with your stay there. We travelled with Thomson, just be aware that the link to the hotel on the website does not give you the correct location, Check out Google Earth for the Riu hotels on the beach in Playacar and you will find the correct location which is perfect. We took a taxi to 5th Avenue in Playa Del Carmen which cost 5 dollars or 50 pesos each way, a bit tacky, all the shops the same but nice to get out of the resort, no worries re safety as this whole area is well policed.

We booked our trip much later than usual and many of the resorts were sold out. When our travel found RIU Playacar, I thought it would be just fine because RIU has a great reputation. This RIU is the bottom of the barrel, not even close to 5 stars. What a joke. The two redeeming qualities were it's location and it's size. The location was ideal, very close to Playa del Carmen in a lovely area with a beautiful beach. The size was good because at the mega resorts we've stayed at if you forget sometihng in the room it's a 45 minute round trip excursion. Here's why the resort is nowhere near 5 stars. The rooms are musty and old. The beds are horrible, even with a \"topper.\" NOTHING luxurious about the room at all. My question is if the beds are so awful and every bed needs a topper, why not make the investment in new mattresses? Perhaps guests would return if they got a good night sleep. The service was so bad compared to other resorts I have been to. The front desk staff was so rude, they appeared to be very bothered if you needed something. The entertainment staff was nice. If you wanted to particpate they were gracious, if not, they left you alone. The food and the choices were not up to par with the other resorts. There is very little food that is healthy, a meager fruit and vegetable selction at the buffets. Lots of heavy casserole type food and plenty of greasy choices. I think this is a suitable place for a budget traveler. The problem for me is that we wanted a true 5 star and this is nowhere near it. I guess it all depends on what you are used to and what your expectations are. I would definitely go back to this area, but NOT to this hotel.

Rooms: The rooms were perfect for what they were, specifically a nice cool place to sleep nightly. The furniture was nice, the beds were hard yes but I still managed a good nights sleep, the bathrooms well cleaned and the minifridge/bar well stocked. We tipped and got cute towel animals and a spotless room daily, a big shoutout to the hardworking cleaning staff!! Grounds/Facilities: It's hard to properly rate this part. I am a single younger male, so for a guy like me who's looking to let loose and meet others, this resort was not for me. But on the other hand, that hardly makes it a bad place to stay. It's a lot smaller than the other RIU resorts in the area, but the more intimate/relaxing/laid back atomosphere is definitely an advantage it has. It has a great buffet restaurant, the a la carte steakhouse where my sister had her wedding banquet was delicious, but never got a chance to try the Asian or Mexican restaurants. Another major plus is that it's right on the newly restored beach which was absolutely beautiful! The only major disaster of our trip was that the swimup bar was closed for repainting for our whole trip, but we were adequetely watered over at the Tequila and Yucatan pools so no huge deal. Staff: Now here's where the RIU Playacar shined. Every single person employed here always had a smile on their face and were always ready to help out for everything. From the lovely Kassy and the rest of the front desk who first greeted us, to Francisco, Polo & the rest of the bartenders who kept us alco-powered all week, to the hilariously awesome Reuben and the Animation staff who kept all guests entertained, to the tireless servers, pool staff, cleaning staff and all others who kept this place running a huge thank you for all your service and smiles! Wedding: In a word... Wow. Just to set the scene, the day of it was overcast and threatening rain all day. The wedding was at 4, and by 3:30 the rain threatened my sister's beachside wedding all day. At 4:45 we were told in the groom's room that the wedding would be moved to the RIU Palace chapel. Were we ever surprised at how well the hotel staffs at both Playacar and Palace managed to adapt and still throw such a beautiful wedding. It went off without a hitch, my sister looked beautiful, they threw an intimate and touching wedding ceremony, and got all our pictures in without any rain whatsoever. The reception at the Playacar steakhouse was equally intimate and delicious, and the wedding dance at the RIU Yucatan disco was just the perfect size for our group and we had the time of our lives. Brides to be, I'm no wedding expert, but if you choose to book here, you will not be disappointed, the RIU staff at all the resorts simply won't allow you to be! Overall: Make no mistake, the RIU Playacar, and the RIU properties in general, I would trust with any all inclusive vacation I ever take. The only reason I would not return to the Playacar specifically is that I perferred the more lively RIU Tequila and RIU Yucatan resorts, but don't let that in any way scare you away from the Playacar. Great grounds, great food and drink, a top notch staff, and excellent company (namely a few great friendly couples from Chicago and Wisconsin, lots of friendly Europeans, and a special someone from England I'm really hoping I'll see again someday :) Rest assured, your Riviera Maya getaway is in great hands with the RIU Playacar!", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peoria, IL", "Title": "\u201cI love this place!!!\u201d", "Author": "rulaw", "ReviewID": "UR65164051", "Content": "This is my second trip to the Riu Playacar & I love this place!!

You don't get pool or beach service, ocean front rooms, room service, decent amentities in the room, more than one lunch choice, or a door to your bathroom. What you do get is a beach in Playa del Carmen, an enthusiastic (and slightly out of step) entertainment crew, great bar staff (hola Francisco and Alexxx) a fair buffet and all the drinks you can stand. The disco over at the Tequila is worth a visit for the young or young at heart, and it's air conditioned. There is very little air conditioned public space at these Riu's and it was sweltering. So yeah, I know it gets warm in Mexico and all that, but it's nice to have some cool space to retreat to. If you do choose this place, I recommend you inspect the room first and ensure you get working air. I requested the air conditioner in the room be fixed four times, and it never was repaired. In fact, the last time I informed that \"the whole building is not working so we are not offering to move your room.\" In response, I am offering to never stay at a Riu again. I can't review the restaurants, thanks to the Riu's ignorant reservation policy. I was told the food was identical to the buffet. The crowd was mostly European, so be prepared for topless action around the pool, and some amazingly small bathing suits on some not so in shape men. I mention this because you may not want your children to learn adult anatomy while on vacation...you've been warned amigos. I must admit, I enjoyed the English fellows singing along to their preferred tunes during the afternoon. Cheers lads. (There is no \"quiet\" pool, maybe a \"quieter\" pool.) Bring some \"Off\" with you for sure. The skeeters are really bad. Anyway, if you get a screaming deal then the Riu Playcar is passable mostly thanks to the awesome staff and the less crowded feeling. Except at the lunch buffet, there you will feel crowded like you are at the Golden Corral. The Riu Playacar is like the resort version of roughing it, and I pretty much knew that based on the price. If you prefer a little more resort in your resort, perhaps consider something a little nicer. Oh, I saw a lady tip 10 USD at the bar.

We were able to find enough to eat, but I wouldn't call it good. The buffet down by the beach was horrible. Breakfast was good. The Yucatan had better meals and we spent more of our time there. Also, by the fifth day of our trip 2 of us had horrible cases of food poisoning. The only place we ever ate was the hotel. The nightly entertainment was so bad it was laughable. If you like night after night of lip syncing and very uncoordinated dancing. It left nighttime with not much to do after supper since we had children in the group. Pool closes early. The hotels alcoholic drinks we very light in the alcohol department. You could drink all day and feel like you were drinking fruit punch. Very skimpy. The hotel room walls are very thin and you could hear screaming and yelling throughout the night. The fridge in our room was stocked only once during the week we stayed. I had to either flag someone in the hall or borrow some from another family member in another room. All we wanted was water to brush our teeth. The beach was absolutely beautiful though. We did notice that the majority of the other hotels along the beach had nice lounge chairs with covers, but not here. I'm not sure who does the rating system for these hotels, but if this hotel was in the U.S. I'm sure it wouldn't be over 2 and a 1/2 stars at tops.

We love Mexico and this was our third visit to the Mayan Riviera. (Prior hotels Sandos and Iberstar Quetzal) This is a smaller hotel about 400 rooms. There was never a problem finding a beach chair on the ocean or by the pool. This was a first since in the past we have had to do the chair battle every morning. The beach restoration is incredible. The sandbags are gone and the white sand is fantastic. Unfortunately, there is NO shade on the beach. Other resorts have shaded umbrella areas or allow you to rent beach umbrellas. Here the only shade you get is the shadow of a palm tree\u2019s trunk. The water was fantastic. One day it was calm as anything and you could snorkel, water sports\u2026 the next was red flags and the current was so strong you could only go up to your knees. The pool area had the shade and many chairs. It is two pools connected by a bridge. The pool with the swim up bar was always busy with activities and people drinking. We stayed on the other side and it was quieter and cleaner. This is a quiet hotel. Not the place for party animals. The kids show was at 8:30 and there were only 3-5 kids participating. The kids club was a small covered building by the beach with some arts and craft activities. My kids thought it was lame and did not participate. (Hard to compare to the amazing program at Dreams, Cancun) The room layout is good for extended families. As you walk down the hall there is a mini hall that leads to two rooms. So a family could shut the hallway door and basically have two adjoining rooms. (Picture the letter Y) The rooms need some updating but appear clean and the maids make some cute towel animals and keep the mini fridge stocked with beer and soda. There is also a liquor dispenser in each room. One of our rooms was fine but the other had a sewer smell. There is free internet access in the smoky lobby. There is one main buffet restaurant that you have breakfast and dinner in. For lunch you can eat by the pool as long as you have shoes and a wrap/ t shirt on. We did not go to the reservation restaraunts as we hear that much of the same food is served at the buffet. There is always pasta, hot dogs and burgers available. Here is why we will not go back to this hotel. Two different times at the main buffet we saw cockroaches on the food. My kids discovered it one day at the bread basket for toast and then I saw it another day at the pastry/bread station. I am one those people who can not deal with bugs and after that could not stand going to the buffet for food. If it was out in the main dining area I could only imagine what was in the kitchen. After seeing it once you are always on alert. I only saw one in the building area but I did notice Raid cans on the maid carts. The day before departure our American Express rep did not show up to confirm our transfer time. The front desk made a big deal out of calling the 800 number for us to try to get a pick up time. The kept saying there would be an additional charge. Finally, they did it for us as a one time courtesy. So if it were not for the bug incidents this resort choice would have been good.

As you are a Riu guest, you are able to visit other Riu chain hotels which are all within walking distance. Riu Playacar is the smallest of the chain in the resort, however, it has the beach unlike the Riu Tequila and Riu Lupita. The Riu Yucatan seems to be the best equipped of these graded hotels, with the gym, boutiques and various shops. The Riu Palace and Playa Maya are in a different league. My main gripes with this hotel where the small bar area in the foyer, you had to walk though a barrage of smoke to get to the resturant, the rooms had an odour the kind you would smell in an unaired old house, the sewarage system needs sorting out, the evening shows were nothing to write home about either. On the plus side, the food is spot on, there is no need to eat in the speciality resturants as the same food is served in the buffet resturant so save yourself a queue in the morning to book them, the beach was fantastic, the rooms were cleaned to a high standard, service was good, I always give a little tip to begin with, that way they are all over you like a rash after that. The staff were friendly and very helpful. The hotel entertainment staff were busy throughout the day and evening, there was always something to do. At lunch times the resturant can get a bit crowed, we used to go later, around 1330ish and never had to wait for a seat, you can have breakfast and lunch in any of the Riu hotels but they ask you to be at your own hotel for evening meal. It was my birthday whilst we were there and the staff catered for it very well with a cake, champagne and Mexican Singers all gratis.

I had read ALOT of reviews on this site about the Playacar - and had mixed feelings of what we would find when we got there. We were absolutely thrilled with the resort! Personally, after staying there a week, I cannot fathom what some of the reviews were talking about. Granted, our entire group are all very laid back, easy to please people.... but we had a wonderful vacation in all aspects! First of all, the resort is the smallest of the three RIU's that we had \"privaliges\" to, but that certainly added alot to the visit. We did spend time at the Tequilla and Yucatan, visiting the sports bar (Tequilla) and attending a \"show\" at the Yucatan. We also walked around both of the other resorts during the day. I personally liked the \"size\" of the Playacar, alot less other guests to contend with at the bars, pools, etc. Granted the other resorts did offer a few more of these options, but we felt so at home at the Playacar... we all agreed that we'd go back in a heart beat. The staff was wonderful, the beds, with a mattress pad applied were great to sleep on ( I actually slept better on the beds than I do at home!), A few of the reviews complained about the rooms needing updating, I thought the rooms we all stayed in were wonderful. Everything was tiled, kept ultra clean.... the bedspreads could maybe use replacing (if I had to find something to say about it), and the shower stall floor was getting a little aged, but that too was kept clean. For one of the couples with us, it was there 4th or 5th trip to Mexico, they commented that of all the resorts they have stayed at, this was the BEST food that they had experienced! It was fantastic, the buffets were always full of food, there were some things you found everyday (but that is ok too!), but there was always something different too. We did dine at the Asian restaurant & the Steakhouse. I'm not a big \"asian food\" fan, but it was good. But we all raved about the meal we had on our last night at the Steakhouse. Most of us had the Kabobs. It was a skewer of Shrimp and skewer of \"tenderloin\" type steak, salad, soup, bread and \"twice baked\" type of potatoe. \"FANTASTIC\" !!! While there, we did the walk into Playa del carmen to shop & had a drink at Senior Frogs, took the ferry to Cozumel to have lunch & shop, did snorkeling in Akumal and rented Jet Ski's right at our resort. Did a bit of shopping at the little \"mall\" across from the resort... and found some very nice things there. The beach in front of the hotel was amazing (all of the \"work\" was done- all the \"sandbags\" were gone. We did spot a few topless \"babes\", (if you are offended by them) but they stayed at the beach and rarely did we encounter them at the pool. We will definaltely have a return trip to this resort in the future.... if you are considering the RIU Playacar... I wouldn't think twice of telling you to \"go for it\" ! If you are used to staying at 5-6 Golden apple type resorts, maybe it wouldn't be for you.... but for those of us who are just looking for a relaxing, beautiful spot to vacation, where thestaff will always go above and beyond to please you with their wonderful talents and smiles.... it is a very welcoming and pleasant place to stay!", "Date": "April 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cNice Place - Don't Pay Too Much\u201d", "Author": "c-spro", "ReviewID": "UR61617819", "Content": "50 of us stayed here and the service was top-notch.

This was my first visit to a resort and I was accompanied by my wife and 6 and 9 year daughters. I had traveled around Mexico as an impoverished student 20+ years ago and was shocked at how pricey things are in this resort area. The girls had a blast the first two days just playing at the pool and jumping in the waves. The beach is beautiful and the waves were just the right size with no strong undertow. To our pleasant surprise there were not too many mosquitoes or spring break party drunks (I guess I would put both in the minor annoyance category), and the resort seemed occupied mainly by families with kids or elderly family members. The negatives: The pillows and beds, as other reviews point out, are terrible, but you can ask for a \"sponge pad\" to be put on top. I had requested this in advance by e-mail and through bookit.com, but there was none the first night and I didn't sleep much. I had booked a double for the four of us and expected two large beds but found a room with two full sized beds pushed together. When I called they said they could push them apart but that really would not have helped in our case so they sent up a small cot and one kid used it (the girls loved it) for the rest of the trip. A group of four young people checking into the next room had the same issue and I believe they changed hotels over it. A pool towel disappeared from our room after the maid came and I had to go beg for another towel card so as not to be charged $20. Internet and telephone service is absurdly expensive, but so is most everything else in this very touristy part of Mexico. I did not bring a laptop (the room safes are too small for them) but many guests did and seemed to get good wireless reception in the lobby/bar area. My family is half Asian and we found the Asian restaurant quite bad, but probably on par with what I remember from living in the midwest and others seemed to enjoy it. There was little to no Mexican food to speak of and I was a little disappointed about that, but having traveled in Yucitan know it's not really known for food. The vendors selling excursions in the lobby are over priced, as others have mentioned. We bought a dolphin encounter from them and I wished I had bought it in Playa del Carmen. The entertainment starts at 9:45, which was too late for my kids. I think they should have a kids' show at 8 and adult show later. The positives: The room, minibar, balcony, was fine and the air conditioning worked well. A mosquito or three got into our room on ocassion because my kids kept leaving the balcony door open but there is a ceiling fan that can be left on all the time. There is an outer door to close against nightime noise and mosquitoes as well as the room door. The TV had too many Nickelodeon/Disney channels in English if anything. The other reviews complaining about the moldy smell or other things indigenous to the tropics are a little over the top I think. Agoutis (google it) roam the grounds as do very tame and clean looking cats and provide entertainment for kids. The beach is perfect for small kids and my girls loved the swim up bar at the pool. We wandered to some other resorts (you are allowed to use 3 others but we used the pool at the Riu Palace and nobody kicked us out) but didn't try the food there. The buffet was very nice but we did get a little tired of it after 6 nights (we ducked out of the Asian place and went there) and we never tried the steakhouse. My wife and I had difficulty getting enough fiber in our diets and I ended up eating a lot of fruit and cereal instead of the well prepared dishes. We rented an econobox from the Thrifty counter in the lobby for 3 days for $99 US and there were no hidden charges. Parking at the hotel is tight but free and as we went to Tulum, Aukumal Beach, Xcaret and the town a few times and I think it was probably cheaper than taking taxis (we did take a taxi once after I turned in the car and found it's a US price, as is most everything else around there). Traveling with small kids in this area is completely safe but take a lot of mosquito repellent if you go to Tulum. Overall, I would say it's a very nice place and could be a great place if they got better beds and maybe had a few more snacks available by the pool.

Special thanks to the entertainment (Animacion) staff - Emilio, Chuy, Chocko, Mahui, Ruben and Nadia. This is the best Animacion staff I have come across. They provided tons of activities during the day - rifle shooting, darts, ping pong, beach and pool volleyball, water aeroblics, dance lessons, etc. - then led an entertaining pre- and post-show in the evening. This staff seemed to genuinely enjoy their job, were always happy, energetic and professional, and went out of their way to make every guest feel special. The beach is beautiful, especially with the millions of dollars recently put into it. Beach chairs were always available although there were no shaded areas close to the water. Chairs by the pool were a little harder to come by but I went out each morning before 8 am for our favourite spot. The grounds are well-maintained. Although it was March Break and the resort would have been at full capacity we did not feel crowded and line-ups for food were very small. The food was OK - nothing spectacular, but basic and plentiful. We only tried one of the 3 specialty restaurants as you had to line up by 7 am to reserve a spot for that night. The resort in general needs some \"modernizing\". Room and safe keys are actually old-fashioned keys (with the rooms numbers printed on them - yikes!) rather than the more modern electronic key cards. Many have complained that the beds are too hard but no one in our room had any problems with them. The bathroom set-up is rather odd with the closet and mini-fridge right in the sink/counter area. The maids did a decent job cleaning the rooms but we did have to call for towels and shampoo a couple of times. We did not do any excursions this time but we did go to nearby Playa del Carmen (a 5 minute/$5 cab ride away) to shop and to a couple of night clubs. If you do nothing else, GO TO COCO BONGO! This club features an amazing musical/dance show (midnight to 3 am) and is well worth the $55 entry fee (which includes an open bar). The resort actually arranges trips there with members of the Animacion staff. This is the way to go as you get VIP entry (no line-ups) and VIP seating (table right next to the stage). This was the highlight of my girls' week as they were asked to be a part of the show and danced on stage. Beware the vendors that the RIU brings on site on certain evenings. You can purchase the same things in Playa del Carmen or at the little shopping centre/market right across the street from the hotel at MUCH cheaper prices. The resort does have a business centre with computers ($3 for 20 minutes) or you can get free internet in the lobby with your laptop. There is no fitness centre on site but you can go across the street to the sister resort and use theirs. There is no room service but there is a lobby bar which is open all night. What I found most disappointing was the arrival of a very LARGE group of spring breakers towards the end of week. These loud and obnoxious young adults were not what I was expecting as I was under the impression that the resort and pretty much the whole Mayan Riviera, did not allow them. Had I wanted spring breakers I would have gone to Cancun. This is the only thing that would prevent me from returning. Overall, I would rate the resort as a 4 star hotel in terms of its comforts and ammenities. Where it gets its highest marks is in its staff and activities. I would definitely recommend this resort and if I can be guaranteed no spring breakers my girls and I will be back again next year.", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, WI", "Title": "\u201cWe made the most of it, it's VACATION\u201d", "Author": "skippy0420", "ReviewID": "UR59435917", "Content": "I am writing this review as a person that understands they are on vacation. Nothing is ever perfect when you have well over 800 people eating, drinking and sleeping in less than a square mile. If you have given this place less than a rating of 4 then you must be one of \u2018those\u2019 people. We knew going in that the resort was not NEW but the staff at the Riu never stopped cleaning that place and everyone was very nice and attentive. Amazing job Riu Employee\u2019s! Check in & Room: Check in was very quick and before we knew it we had a margarita in hand and were ready to head to the room. What can you say, a room is a room and we are on vacation for the outside, not the inside. A/C(check), Bed(check), Pillows(check), Shower(check), towels(check). OK, we are all good\u2026. The bed was quite hard but we did not mind and since it\u2019s two pushed together it ends up being HUGE. FOOD: Lobby Buffet (breakfast and dinner): We ate here EVERY morning and had 3 dinners and there was something for everyone. We are not picky eaters so all was fair game. They have late hours in the evening so even if you have been out all day and needed a siesta you could still get dinner at 9PM if you wanted. Lounge Buffet (lunch): This buffet is smaller than the Lobby but they still have quite a bit to choose from. The beer is on tap there so you can grab a glass and fill\u2019er up if need be. *** Go to the Lobby Buffet at 7AMish to sign up to eat at the three places listed below. There are two seatings for each: 6:45 & 8:45PM. I hate to say it but I preferred the buffet over these, but we did try them all and I think you should while you are there also*** Jade: Was our least favorite of the three. It was not bad, it was just like a Chinese buffet instead of a \u2018special\u2019 type dinner. The d\u00e9cor was a nice change of pace and we were able to skip the fork for some chopsticks. Steakhouse: We would put this in the middle of the three. Appetizers were good and there were nice choices on the menu and it was nice to not be in a buffet line. Steaks were cooked as ordered and the show for the Baked Alaska dessert was fun to watch. Mexican: Out of the three we liked this the best. Nice appetizers right away and it just felt like a \u2018home\u2019 cooked meal while in Mexico. Again, nice to not be in the buffet line and the shot of Tequila can\u2019t hurt! BAR(s): Lobby Bar: Daniel was the man during the day\u2019s there. Even though people were ordering every mixed and frozen drink under the sun at one time he was always smiling and doing what he could to help the customers. I suggest the lobby bar early afternoon through dinnertime. Pool Bar: Considering the size and shape of the pool I believe that it\u2019s in a great location and all of the guys there are very helpful and attentive. The Pool is in the same general area as all of the pool activities but there is enough room for everyone. Lounge Bar: Francisco held this place down all on his own. He could speak English, French and was on top of anything that was required. This is the area that we would head to right after dinner for a nightcap as the entertainment is there. ENTERTAINMENT: Daytime: The pool is where it\u2019s at for aerobics, volleyball and whatever other crazy things the guys have going on that day. Nighttime: Head to the lounge for one or two nights while you are there. They had a couples game that was so funny and it\u2019s a real relaxed atmosphere all together. BEACH: We spent a day or two on the beach and all of the work done over the last months have paid off. We were able to walk out quite a ways and it tops any Cancun beach I have seen by FAR. OVERALL: We are already talking about getting a larger group together for next year. For the price and location I don\u2019t think you can beat it. It\u2019s listed as a family place and it is, although as a couple we had a great time.

Italian, we ate at da bruno. it's very authentic n tasty comin from an italian backround lololo. For nightclubs, we went to mandala every time :) awsome party!

I understand the resort's concerns about under age drinking; however, this was not the right way to handle welcoming guests to the resort. Our boys were not typical spring breakers as they were with parents. Furthermore, a chair in their lobby had wet black paint on it as it was not fully dried before they placed it in the lobby. It ruined my brand new dress and I immediately showed the help what had happened. They took my name and room number and said they would get back with me, which they never did. When I asked them again the night before we left the manager proceeded to blame me for not bringing my dress down so they could try to fix it - they told me they would get back with me about it and never did.

I went with my parents, my brother and another family including a couple and their daughter (there were seven of us). The weather during our stay was beautiful! It only rained once; unfortunately it was on our last day. The rooms were pretty nice. The beds weren\u2019t the best, but we borrowed mattress pads and that made them more comfortable. The cleaning service was good. Everything was done; our used towels were replaced, the floors were swept and even our shoes were neatly arranged! Also, if it matters to anyone, they make awesome towel animals! The service at the bars was great; we never had to wait more than 5 minutes, even at the busiest times. The bartenders (actually all of the employees) were super nice! The food at the buffet was pretty good, however the restaurants were mediocre. The steakhouse was awful (lots of fat!), the Mexican restaurant was okay, and the Japanese restaurant was good. It was hard to get reservations too; we had to wake up super early to make them because there were big lines! I\u2019m more of an ocean person anyway, but the pool wasn\u2019t that great. It was cold (colder than the ocean) and I found that it was pretty dirty, especially later in the day. They had volleyball in the pool and on the beach, as well as water aerobics which was fun. There was also a very handy pool bar! There were plenty of lounge chairs for everyone around the pool, but we went and reserved some with our towels every morning, just in case. The beach was absolutely gorgeous. It was just renovated like a month ago and it\u2019s really nice. There was tons of white sand and turquoise water. I love to snorkel, and unfortunately the snorkelling was terrible; there is nothing to look at! I didn\u2019t see any fish and there was no coral, only a sandy bottom. It was nice, just not for snorkelling. There were however snorkelling trips. Also, there is no shade, not umbrellas or trees, so that was a problem for my really pale friend! A final problem was that it was really wavy. On our first day, we couldn\u2019t even go in because the waves were so big and the undertow was so strong. We went parasailing and it was awesome; totally worth the $60. Those staying in this resort were allowed to go visit two other resorts down the street; the Riu Tequila and the Riu Uketan (not positive about that spelling). We were allowed to do everything there (including drink and eat), except eat dinner. It was a nice change. The Tequila even had a club! There was a cute plaza directly across the street and it had tons of little shops filled with neat things. There was also a Starbucks in the plaza! Also, town is only a 5-10 minute taxi ride away and it had great shopping. You could even walk to town from the resort\u2019s beach; it was about a 30 minute walk. There is free wireless internet in the lobby for those who bring laptops. There are plenty of weird, but cute, animals running around for those who care. As for excursions, we went to a place called XTREME and it was fantastic! Totally got our money\u2019s worth; it was about $90 a person. There was zip lining over jaguars and crocodiles and through waterfalls (this lasted about 2hrs, and wear clothes that can get soaked), there were little cars that you could drive though the jungle, and there were underground caves with amazing stalactites that you could swim through, and take rafts through. Also, lunch and drinks were free and delicious! There was a buffet. If you go to this resort, go there. It\u2019s awesome. Overall, it was a great time and it was beautiful!

She took extremely good care of us and made sure that everything was fabulous! If you are hard to please, you might want to consider staying elsewhere--like in the U.S.--as this is a resort in Mexico (thus not everyone will speak English, there are different cultural expectations, the accommodations may not be perfect, etc.). But hubby and I had a fabulous time at the Riu Playacar and are looking forward to a return visit! Room: We had a beautiful room. The bathroom was slightly outdated but it was squeaky clean. We had plenty of towels and they brought more when needed. Requested more pillows and they were delivered no problem. Air conditioning didn't function perfectly but we were outside most of the time--no worries! Room fridge was well-stocked, and, upon request, was filled with diet soda. Pool/Beach: Perfect. The beach had plenty of chairs, all in good shape. Towel hut was well-stocked, no line. Plenty of shady and sunny spots for all. Bars: We enjoyed each of the bars--they had everything we wanted except REAL fruit drinks. The pina coladas and strawberry daquiris were the pre-mixed variety which was a disappointment; however, we enjoyed mojitos and bloody marys every day. Food: We tend to eat healthy and had no problem finding stuff we liked. We requested cheese omelettes every morning which was no problem for the omelette chef. There was plenty of fresh fruit at every meal and lots of fixings for salads. Great bread, cheese, etc. Americans and Europeans will not be disappointed. Desserts tended to be a bit bland but that seems to be pretty consistent in Mexico, whether it is off the beaten path or at an American-style resort. There were also plenty of fried foods, soups, meats, etc. from which to choose. I would not suggest doing Riu's a la carte restaurants as they seemed to simply serve food from the buffet--I would rather have lots of choices from the buffet than just a few choices at an a la carte restaurant (especially one that seems to serve the same food from the buffet). The only real gripe I have is that while the food was great, it was definitely NOT authentic Mexican food. But that's to be expected at a resort frequented by people who have never left the U.S. except for trips to Cancun etc. Entertainment: We are pretty quiet people on vacation and easily found quiet spots where we wouldn't be bothered, i.e. the quiet pool and the beach. There were other people who desired more interaction/entertainment and they found it at the \"party\" pool every afternoon. In other words, we got what we wanted and others did, too. It was great. RE: nightlife, the Playacar and its sister resorts seemed to have several great options for nighttime entertainment, such as a nightclub, shows, bars, etc. Since we were away from our children and wanted time for each other as well as SLEEP (!), we retired early every night after a nice walk into town (1 mile each way). Other considerations: We tipped frequently but noticed others who didn't--regardless, service was great. The one bit of advice I would give travelers is to eat your main meal BEFORE you head to the airport for your return flight, or sneak a few pieces of fruit from the buffet, or even pack a sandwich at the buffet (bring a few ziplocks with you!), as the prices for food at the Cancun airport are OUTRAGEOUS (i.e. $10 for a burger, $9 for a slice of pizza, etc.).

He said, \"welcome to Paradise\" and that pretty much sums up our trip. This resort is not for you if you are HARD TO PLEASE. There is something for everyone here - if you can't find it - ask - the staff is eager to please. We ate breakfast and dinner in the main dining area. The buffet was very good and the variety is amazing. We had lunch at the beach area and the chips and salsa are \"the real thing\"! All the food was delicious. We walked the beautiful beach every day, played tennis almost every morning, and enjoyed visiting The Yucatan and Tequilla Resorts also. The entertainment is really good, but after a few days, it can get tiresome because it is rather very loud. We enjoyed the entertainment crew - they made every effort to create a fun atmosphere for everyone. The houskeeping staff works very hard to keep everything neat and clean. They are completely trustworthy and will honor any request you may have for towels, soap - whatever. The only thing I can say negative about the rooms is that they are a little damp/musty - but you have to remember that this is a tropical area. The beds are very firm, but after a couple of night we realized how good they were for our backs. We tend to have lower back pain often, but no back pain whatsoever after sleeping on those beds.

Worst holiday yet!\u201d", "Author": "bnfbabe", "ReviewID": "UR58325452", "Content": "We arrived end of Feb, a group of 11. The purpose of the trip was a friends wedding, I was her bridesmaid. We booked and flew with Thomson. The girls in the office were awful, total waste of time. We and the rest of the group will not be booking with them again. The premier upgrade on the flight is well worth the money! Especially if you enjoy your sleep. We were the only two who paid for this pleasure, the others just paid additional to pre book seats together. WASTE of time. they paid over 150 GBP between them to have allocated seats, as the married couple have a young baby and wanted him to be easily passed between grandparents etc during the 9 hr flight. They did not get the seats allocated on the return trip. The mother was told- on the return- this was because of the baby- he could not sit in window seats due to the fact there are only 2 air masks and he was being put at risk.. funny how no one mentioned this when they prebooked in the travel agents, or on the flight out???? They were split up evenly front and baack of the aircraft. Not really great service esp when your newly weds!!! mum was also told very rudely baby was to remain in his seat, she was not to walk up the aisle with him in her arms to get him off to sleep- she wasnt told this on the way out either!! The wedding itself- I would not get married abroad. Wedding at 4pm, meal was 6.45 and we were instructed to be out by 8pm. No special allowances! when asked what we may do between 4.30pm and 6.45pm the response was 'well, we could organize a cocktail party we suppose??' The flowers in the book to choose from look pretty rubbish- but on the day were nothing more than stunning. If you get married here, do not expect any special treatment! you literally get what u pay for. That is, if you get the wedding breakfast delivered to your room next morning.. which this couple didn't either! It was a very quick ceremony, not what you dream of! For anyone marrying here- the 'gardens' are the short grass area infornt of the breakfast patio- not a secret garden like you may think!! The funniest moment was an american chap shouting 'holy cow' at full volume as the bride and her father made their way up!!! his mouth was swinging open like he had never seen a wedding before! The rooms- well- they stink of damp and the drains stink. This smell will be on your clothes when you get home, allow some extra kgs flying out free- the water on your clothes will weigh your cases down!! 2 others in our party did move rooms, we decided not to, as the rooms they moved to were no better than before. top floor is supposedly better than ground... Keep your patio door open and turn the air con off- this actually smells worse... As for our couple getting wed here, thomson apparantly emailed asking for a room with a bath, to which they were told all rooms had baths. This was so they could bath the baby. They were prepared to pay for the upgraded room with a bath, but seeing as the 'normal' rooms had baths..they didnt.. No rooms had baths-unless you upgrade. They put the couple, the baby, the buggy and the luggage, cases, suits etc on the top floor. Mummy decided she was not carting baby 3 flights of stairs 4 times daily with buggy and all the gear. The top floor room allocated smelt so badly she didn't pass the threshold before she requested a ground floor room. Which was given, after almost forcing the staff! When she arrived in this room, no bath, and concrete wall outside her balcony door. Still smelt damp. Bride now in tears- no bath, damp room with 14month old baby. In the end, it required the rep to intervene. They did get an upgrade. but not without being told several times the 'hotel was full nothing else'. Room upgrade was nice- much better- but not worth the money in the thomson brochure. Okay, the food- available all day, good food. Staff generally are very nice. If you stay for 14 nghts you will crave something other than deep fried, pizza, chips, burger or hot dogs. be warned! The hotel itself is ok, not to the star rating in our opinion. The americans- this place is their Benidorm. They threw up in the stair wells, were staggering about drunk at 1pm, loud, rude, rowdy, overtook the pool, the bar, the works. They walk into you. They push past you, they stand next to your table at dinner having a 'chat'- no worry about your meal! the animacion team are all great lively guys, but the beach volleyball, pool games etc- its no relaxing break here. From our party we were all in different blocks, and every one of us had trouble with drunk Americans. One couple with us had them shouting 1-5 repeatedly until 3am where one was escorted away security. Another night they were banging on everyones doors demanding everyone wake up and party at early hours. We heard our neighbours drunkly discussing their body parts, whilst loudly procreating most nights early hours- enough to wake us up! They also broke street lights, uprooted bins generally ruined the place. Your rooms are cleaned daily, fresh towels etc no issues here. We had a video camera stolen during the wedding, but we are almost 100% this was a guest. The staff to us are 100% trustworthy. By the end of our stay we left out money etc in our rooms and it was always exactly were we left it. 5th avenue is great for shopping, eating etc. Do not buy jewels here, visit playa las americas in cancun we got our best diamonds there. You can wear your jewels, wallets etc no prob in playa del carmen. great place. We visited cozumel- had its day in our opinion. Cancun was very lively, almost a 'mini mock up of vegas' but not cheap. Chichen itza is a long day, but fantastic if you can do the trip- our tour guide victor was abs fantastic full of info etc. Cream up well, take a hat, and plenty of water of not provided. This place is like an oven. we swam with dolphins- our advice, take a 'non swimming' friend to film and photograph- 50 USD for a ten min DVD is pretty harsh! Haggle for everything. Best 'touristy' stuff we bought was at chichen itza- 4-5USD for most things. we bought two of the chess sets for 250pesos! We did not enjoy the hotel. Not relaxing unless you enjoy getting drunk on tequila everyday and spewing up, no worries about where you sleep! We would recc to anyone to go to the mayan palace (2006) its worth the extra money. Thi is only half of the tale too- We will not be returning to this hotel. A further tip- if you go to bed before 11pm- try get a room in block one or two- the music h=thumps VERY loudly if your at the pool end of block 5 and 6!! poor baby managed to sleep through it, just!

Upon checking in, Aldo at the front desk made sure we were taken care of. Thanks Aldo. The resort was very clean and I liked the idea it was smaller than the other resorts, less pedestrian traffic, not long line-ups for food. The staff were very pleasant and made sure we were happy and well taken care of. Thanks to Gilberto, Elly, Herbert (in the dining areas) and Emilo (activities) and others that contributed to our enjoyment of the resort. The only thing I was not impressed with was the lunch buffet. Yes, they had a variety of food, but it was the same daily and due to it being outside, mostly cold. I'm not a very picky eater, but I feel there could have been more choice to make sandwiches. I personally found the breakfast and dinner buffets good. We did not get into any of the a la cartes as they were filled early in the morning. There was no shade on the beach but the beaches were beautiful. The ocean was very rough the week we were there and quickly pulled you under, even if you weren't out very far. The water was very warm and it sure beats snow and cold weather! There are no restrooms close to the beach, so be prepared to trek up to the buffet area. We had no problem getting chairs on the beach and most were in good working order. We lucked out with the weather and had a pretty good week of it, rain one day only. I would definitely return to this resort and recommend it to others. There was a constant musty smell in the rooms but that seems to be the case in a lot of the hotels. Nothing dried either (clothing) but what can you do. It did not spoil our time there. If you like peanut butter, they don't supply it at the buffet. It would be wise to take your own, especially if you have kids with you that eat it. We went into Playa Del Carmen a few times (even at night) by taxi ($5 fare one way) and the taxi drivers were very friendly and talkative.

We've been \"regulars\" to the Mayan Riviera district for about the last 7 years and stayed in a variety of places from Cancun down south of Playa Del Carmen. This hotel was one of our better experiences. Here's what we liked about about it. We are always \"into\" a place that is well suited to bring young children - not that we travel with ours every time. We like the family atmospher and try to steer away from the spring break hangouts. We decided that the Riu Hotels (there are several in the complex there) seem to cater well to families. We were pre-spring break this time and mostly there were middle aged adults and families. Staff was great; Food was some of the absolute best we have ever had at an all inclusive resort. No kidding, it was GREAT. Riu Playacar is within about a 30 minute walk into the shopping district of 5th Avenue of Playa Del Carmen, or take a cab ride for ~ $5. Great area, good food, (but you better like haggling, cause they sure do) The hotel beach was niceand spacious and kept clean - about a third of it under palms for those that like shade. Plenty of lounge chairs.. not enough hammocks for my liking. Overall, hotel grounds felt opened and airy with good breezes blowing through, were well kept, rooms were nice - One complaint was the beds were not all that comfortable - but so far not many have been. I'm usually so glad to be away, I don't care much. Some may feel otherwise. Hotel supplies plenty of bottled water and a wide range of other drinks in your in room frig. We've seen some more opulent hotels, this is not one of them, but it's not the low end either.. I'd rate it a 4 - 5 star. We walked through some of the othe Riu properties, and they all seemed nice.

However, just want to point out that this resort should not be considered a 5 star - even for Mexico. First the pluses:: Landscaping is very lush and beautiful, pools are lovely, lots of shade at beach and pools, and food is very good. The entertainment team and bar staff are wonderful. What we did not enjoy:: the lobby is very small, not very inviting, the bar area is very loud. The rooms are in need of updating, not that this was a huge issue for us...as we don't spend much time in the rooms. However, for a 5 star resort, some attention is required here. We waited for close to 4 hours for a room when we arrived. We ended up in a third floor room close to the lobby. Location of rooms not an issue, as the resort is quite small, however, if you have mobility issues, you will not wish to be in a third floor room, as there are many stairs to climb. If you are intending to visit you may wish to keep this in mind, and ensure you request a first or second floor room. We actually spent a lot of our time in the other two Riu resorts we were able to use. We were very impressed by both of them... Riu Yucatan and Riu Tequila. Yucatan is on the beach and Tequila is across the road. Both of these resorts are sold at the same price point as Riu Playacar. I would strongly suggest you book at one of these as the facilities are much better than Playacar . You should also be aware the Mexican Govt. have currently embarked on a huge beach project to try to contain further beach erosion. This means that some of the beach areas may still be closed due to this work. However, we returned on Jan. 29th, so it may be nearing completion now if not already completed. This of course has nothing to do with the Resorts, but a mandate of the Government. This was not the most attractive aspect for me (but very necessary), however, seemed to be a source of enjoyment and curiosity for my husband and others to watch this work in progress! The Riu resorts complex location is wonderful, being close to Playa del Carmen, and having a market across the road. I would strongly urge you to visit Playa del Carmen, take the ferry to Cozumel, visit XelHa and XCaret...all of which were a wonderful addition to our trip and most certainly worth the visit.

Not only was the beach completely closed off with orange fencing, there were large pipes laying on it and at least 3 to 4 tractors and bulldozers running all day long. Machinery was backing up with that \u201cbeeping\u201d sound, from early morning throughout the day. Even while sitting at the pool there was a constant drone of equipment. Not what we had in mind for our relaxing, beachfront vacation. We do not understand why we were not informed about the beach being closed before we arrived. The Riu hotels should have informed Expedia who should have informed us. We feel we should have been given the option of changing hotels or changing the date to when the beach would be available. We booked a BEACHFRONT hotel because we wanted to be able to go to the beach whenever we wanted to! And we booked an all-inclusive so we would have access to food and drinks without having to worry about bringing money to the beach, etc. Trying to salvage our trip, we walked to the Riu Lupita beach club area: This area of beach was being used by guests from the Riu Playacar, Riu Yucatan and Riu Palace because all of the beach area in front of those hotels was closed. And the guests from Riu Lupita and Riu Tequila were already using it. Needless to say it was very crowded and meant we had to get to the beach very early to even try to get a lounge to sit on. And if we wanted to eat lunch somewhere besides the beach club, we had to walk back to one of the other hotels. And the only drinks available were beer and wine. One day it started raining and we had to walk the 15 minutes back to the hotel, not just go back to our room. Service at the hotel was fine, food okay, but the beach situation was awful. Would not stay here again unless the beach was open.", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cWhat a great value\u201d", "Author": "bonyt", "ReviewID": "UR55097612", "Content": "Seriously, to the naysayers who have negative reviews for this resort, word of advice, next year save your money and be miserable at home.

We have stayed at several RIUs before and have always been happy with the service and food and location. We were not disappointed in those things on this trip. You should know what kind of travelers we are as that affects the review... we want the hotel to be clean and nice, but not necessarily plush and upscale. We care about the food as we haven't been lucky eating away from our resorts in the past, but we aren't super finicky or expect 5-star dining. We like to have fun - have a social nightlife around vs. very quiet, romantic type of trip. Yet, not a ton of party people everywhere, all the time. Food We have always enjoyed the RIU food and again it was wonderful. Everyone we met raved about the food - now it is Mexico so when you rave about the food it's not raving in a Four Seasons 5-course meal sort of way... but much of it was excellent. My friend is an great cook and she was always commenting on how everything was so good. We ate in the mexican specialty, the asian, and the buffet. Asian was better of the specialities, but really, the buffet was probably our favorite. Rooms Basic Mexican rooms. Very clean. Always well stocked and maintained by staff. Nothing special, but nothing bad either. Not much storage - we used the bedside tables as drawers as well as dresser - that's a minor thing. Beds are hard - but the added mattress pad made more of a difference that I would have believed. We spend very little time in our room since we come from a cold weather climate and come for the sun. Service This is where the RIU shines. I can't speak to the front desk since I didn't deal with them much, but the waiters and bartenders are exceptional. Really exceptional. You never wait long for anything and often they anticipate what you need. They are very busy, yet never seem stressed or unable to accommodate any request. They work hard yet never show signs of strain or tiredness. There is no way, unless you are a difficult person and we did see difficult people there - that you could be unhappy with service. My husband lost his wedding ring during a pool game, but we had no idea where it was and didn't expect to ever find it. Viktor on the entertainment staff heard about it and actually searched for it with goggles at the end of his very long day. He surprised us the next morning with it. It was really touching and thoughtful and just a small example of the extra things that are done by the staff that go above and beyond. Beach We were there at the time of beach restoration. We used the beach for about 3.5 days and then it was fenced off. You could still lay on the beach but couldn't run into the water or walk along in front because of machinery and pipes. I knew this could be coming and it was a bummer but not unexpected. We could walk over one hotel and jump in. By the time others get there, it will probably be done. Not anything the RIU could control and it didn't impact our fun. Otherwise, the location is great - really close to town and just a few minutes to the RIU Tequila and Yucatan. Downtown Great. Really changed from the last time we went to this area 12 years ago. Many trendy restaurants and clubs. Lots of shopping. Felt very safe and it was really fun to hang out there. Saw an awesome fire show at the Blue Parrot on the beach. Went into town two nights and it was well worth it. Overall RIU Playacar is a great place to stay. The top things it offers is really good food, excellent staff, and a really good location. It's not upscale, but it wouldn't be for the price. You have to know that it's a more affordable-medium priced hotel, but in that category, I think it over delivers. Plus, you really have three hotels and their entertainment, bars, restaurants available to you which is such a great idea. We went back and forth everyday. I think anyone who stays at the RIU Playacar will be pleased.", "Date": "January 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGood enough!\u201d", "Author": "janef507", "ReviewID": "UR54410379", "Content": "I agree with the reviews below - not a 5 star resort, but good enough for a quick & cheap getaway. I just returned on Sunday 1/24, was there only 3 nights, celebrating my boyfriend's birthday. The only complaints we had were: - Fridge in the room wasn't working (not keeping stuff cold), but we asked someone to come fix it and they did and then it was fine. - Room did have a musty odor, i brought an air freshener and it was fine. The dresser drawers had a weird smell too, so i didn't put my clothes in there, put them all in the closet, which was huge. - Toilet kept running, had to play around with the handle to make it stop - Beach chairs (at the pool and on the beach) are not in the best shape, some were broken. They are made out of cheap netting which sags in the seat area and is sometimes ripped. A couple of the plastic chairs are cracked. But you just have to get out there early and reserve a few good ones. - FYI - If you don't make your dinner reservation between 7am and 10am, you will not be able to eat at the a la carte restaurants! So make sure to make your reservations early. What made up for this: - The beach is beautiful! - The staff are eager to please so if you are not happy with something, they will do their best to make up for it. - Aldo at the reception desk is the BEST! If you are going to celebrate a special occasion, tell them. They will hook u up! They gave us a great room (#6310) on the 3rd floor in the building all the way by the water (pink building). The room was good, nice king size bed and good size bathroom. And the balcony!!!! It was HUGE and overlooked the pool and the ocean, just amazing! We spent most of our time out there! - Lots of food options, we thought the food was pretty good, but we didn't have dinner on the resort (went to downtown PDC), just breakfast and lunch, which were both buffets with great options. - Locatin is great. We walked to town in about 25 mins, cab is $5. You can walk down the beach during the day and visit the other Riu's which is fun. Overall, we were happy with our vacation. But we're not picky and when we travel it's all about what we do, not where we stay, so it fit our needs just fine.

We are both married and are in our mid 30's. We chose this hotel because it was close to town and I thought that would be easier for us as it was my friend's first time to Mexico. I wasn't expecting a 5 star hotel but it is close to a 3 star. I do travel to Mexico often so I am familiar with the area. Food- I have eaten at several all inclusives and the food at this hotel was not horrible but not great. Normally I am able to find a few things that I really like and eat them throughout the week but I really didn't find anything. The drinks were always strong but never tasted too good. Beach- It was nice and looks like the sand bags will be gone soon since they are renovating the beaches. It was a little small but just enough room because the hotel is so small. when I walked down the beach and looked at the other Riu's and hotels it looked like they were sitting on top of each other. Our beach felt a little tight but not as crowded as the other ones. Hotel- The hotel was small is size as expected. The grounds were kept up but it was very average looking. I was very disappointed in our room. It was very outdated. There was an odor but that doesn't bother me too much being in a damp area. I brought air freshners as suggested by others and it helped. The beds were indeed very hard but I have never had a very comfortable bed in any hotel in Mexico but these were the worst. From reading previous reviews I thought this was a quiet hotel but it seemed to get very loud at night. I don't mind a little noise because we like to have a good time too but every night we were woke up around 4am with people yelling, running through the halls, and slamming doors. Our room was located very close to the front lobby bar where everyone hung out so maybe that was part of the problem and maybe there was just a loud group at the hotel when we were there. Safety- We felt very safe on the hotel grounds at all times. There was always a taxi waiting at the front gate of the hotel and would catch a ride to town for $4-5 dollars never more. EL Fondo (sp)- Local Mexican rest- We ventured there because it had good reviews. The food was very good until we started seeing raw chickens and pork being carried from truck into the kitchen. Normally I wouldn't have an issue with that but there were chips and cheese laying across the meat that was loose and not packaged so we had to leave to restaurant for sanitary resons. Service- I felt the service was average. I have had better service in all of the other all inclusives I have stayed at. We were told to call the front desk before 4pm to have our fridge restocked with drinks. We had several issues with this as we called at 11am and came back to our room at 4pm and we had nothing to drink. We called the front desk over five times during the next 4 hours and was told each time they were on their way. We were very frustrated and called the manager who finally took care of it. I expressed my disappointment and when we returned to our room that night they had a bottle of champagne left out for us and our fridge was stocked to the max so at least they followed through. Most of the staff were plesant and fun.

Across the street from the hotel is a really nice outdoor plaza with better quality souvenirs at reasonalbe prices. Be careful in Playa Del Carmen, if they say they are coming back with change, be prepared to go with them to get that change. stick to the shops on the main street and avoid the market stalls on side streets. Took a one day excursion for $107. Well worth it. Lunch at a real hacienda, underground cave that you could swim in, ruins at Ek Balam (wear sturdy shoes) and a trip to Vallendeloid, quaint town. I would recommend this hotel for a quiet relaxing holiday. Riu Tequila was a younger and partying crowd, 10 minute walk to the beach across the street. Riu Yucatan was very large and busy, beautiful southwestern theme. Playacar is a gated community so it was always safe to take an evening walk, many beatiful homes and hotels. trip from the airport took an hour and a half because this hotel is the last drop off.

There are several other hotels that are on the beach and next time, we will pick one of those. The grounds are very clean and well kept and the staff are very friendly. The entertainment at night wasn't that great. We went over to the RIU Tequila for 2 nights and there was quite a few more people and their shows were great! The advantage of the RIU chains is that you can go to the others for food and entertainment and to walk around. The food at the Playacar was very good, with much to choose from a lot of variety.

I had ever brought air fresheners for the room and that did not help at all!! Bring dryer sheets for the drwers to keep your clothes from smelling!! The beds are rock hard and on arrival ask for a matress pad for your bed. They will put you on a list, so don't wait. The beach was very nice, there are great big sand bags that are an eye sore...but overall the beach was nice. The other thing that we noticed is it seemed that everyone smoked! If you don't mind smoking, than don't worry about it...but if you do, this isn't your hotel. Also, the beach is optional topless, so if you have kids...beware! If we were to back to this area, we would definetly pick a different resort. also, we took insulated mugs that were very helpful.

Tasty (although uninspired) food. Something for everyone. Staff okay but service uneven (i.e. they told us a table with breakfast would be set up for early departure (5:30 a.m.) but there was nothing but coffee the next day; my sister-in-law got towel figurines but we didn't). That said, they will do anything you want if you tip them. Nice shows at night. Well laid out, relatively small property, therefore great for families with small children and those with mobility issues. One of my main issues: smelly rooms. Followed tips on this site, brought air freshener, opened balcony door, all to no avail. Took a week for the moldy smell to leave the suitcase when we got home. Interestingly, my sister-in-law's room did not have this smell so I don't know what to say. Second big issue: noise. Series of rooms encircle a small inner courtyard; therefore noise carries and the cleaning staff makes no effort to be quiet, calling out to each other and talking loudly on their walkie-talkies. Also, the layout is such that every two rooms have adjacent doors , which are heavy and although there is a stopper to minimize slamming, they still make incredible noise when they close. Forget sleeping in at this resort. Bugs fly into the room every time the door is opened and the maids leave the doors open while they clean so be prepared for this. Also, this is not a place for couples that like to cuddle. The two double beds are pushed together and if you separate them, you're left with half a headboard because it's one big piece that extends the width of the two beds. Saw a Riu hotel catalog and it looks like most of their properties set up the rooms this way. On the plus side, the cot brought in for our daughter was really more like a bed than a foldaway. As for the mattress & pillows, all the other reviewers were dead on so I brought my own pillow and asked for a topper, which made a huge difference. I must be pretty fussy because none of the other 18 members of our group complained about the mattress or pillows. Amazing weather means you can sometimes leave the balcony door open at night (there is a screen) but forget this if your room is in the back because the staff wheels large noisy carts at all hours. Make sure to bring a sweatshirt and pants because it can get chilly & windy at night. Another pet peeve of mine was that there was no Latin music. Why did I come to Mexico? In Cuba (I'm Canadian) there was music all the time, which did wonders for the ambiance. Our group had children aged 17-30; they hung out at the Riu Tequila bar & disco and went into town whenever we allowed them ($5 cab ride - make sure to have exact change because they rip you off on the exchange if you don't). If you have the bucks, do the excursions with a private driver. Costs the same if not less than an organized excursion and gives you more flexibility, not to mention time. Ask the front desk for recommended drivers. We went to Chichen Itza this way, shaved at least 90 minutes off the ride, which is a lot considering it's 3 hours each way. You can also see ruins closer by. Whatever you do, make sure to visit a \"cenote,\" an underground river. If you have little ones, make sure to take a life jacket. It's an amazing nature site. Careful who you book with because the front desk told me that con artists take your $ but then never show up. Overall, this property gives you good bang for the buck.", "Date": "January 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wasaga Beach, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Christmas Vacation\u201d", "Author": "BeachyCheecky", "ReviewID": "UR52589690", "Content": "From the time we arrived to the time we left we received wonderful service and as a family vacation at Christmas there was nothing missing! Check in was a breeze and although we arrived at 12 noon and our rooms were not to be ready until 3:00 pm, they stored our luggage, gave us a place to change, gave us our braclets and directed us to the bar and lunch buffet. Our room was actually ready at 2:00 pm and Charly from the front desk was actually looking for us to give us our room keys. The rooms were adjacent which was perfect as we travelled with our 18 year old son and 16 year old daughter. The extra large king size bed was great. We both suffer from bad backs and had no problem with the firm mattress. Both kids loved their big beds. The air conditioning and tvs worked fine in both rooms. The minibar was stocked everyday. A little note to our chambermaid ensured that we received extra towels and she did wonderful towel animals or left flowers every day. The only drawback was that there was only lukewarm water between 5:00 pm and 7:00 pm as it appeared that everyone in the 492 room resort went to their rooms at that time and showered. The swim up bar was terrific. We had no problem getting a seat at the bars, the pool side lounge chairs or the lounge chairs on the beach. Everything was very clean and beautiful. the grounds were well kept. The Christmas decorations and nativity seen were beautiful. The beach was very clean and we walked quite a distance to the point and back - very safe - no peddlers. we had access to the Riu Yucatan and the Riu Tequila - both were also very beautiful and well kept. Service was excellent at all three resorts. The nightshows were great especially the ones with the dancing - there were tributes to Michael Jackson, Grease and the Movie Show - a great shout out to Luis \"Chocolat\" and to Cesar from the animation team. At this resort the animation team was neither too loud nor too intrusive - you participated if you wanted and were left alone if you declined. The workout facilities used by my son were at the Yuctan which was a quick and safe 5 minute walk from our resort. The disco was at the Tequila and was a very short two minute walk and my son and daughter went a few nights and had no problems. Our day trip to Xcaret National Park was beautiful - 15 minutes away by taxi. The shopping in Playa del Carmen was terrific and go to the Walmart as it has the best prices for liquor, souvenirs, and tobacco - it is a 30 minute walk from the resort or a 5 minute cab ride from the hotel at a cost of $5 US each way. The swim with the dolphins was a great way to top off our week and we did this separate from the Xcaret park so as not to lose out on our Xcaret experience. The people from Delphinus picked us up at our hotel and brought us back. For those who need their Starbucks fix there was a Starbucks right across the street from the hotel - same prices as back home! There was a small shopping area across the street - prices were higher than in Playa del Carmen but still reasonable if you bartered. The hotel had internet service available and a business centre. If you take your own computer, the lobby is the place with the best WiFi. The restaurants were terrifice - buffet breakfast until 10:00 am, continential breakfast by the beach from 10:30 am to 12 noon, Lunch from 12 to 4 and dinner from 6 to 10:30, snacks after that. We tried the Asian restaurant and the Steakhouse Restaurant a la cartes -both wonderful - yes you have to book them in the morning at the buffet restaurant but there was no problem but since we are all late diners we preferred the 8:45 pm sitting as oppose to the 6:00 pm sitting. The big Christmas dinner is done on Christmas Eve and what a spread! There was plenty to eat and yes our traditional North American Ham and Turkey was available as well as lots of fish, lamb, roast beef, ribs, caviar and a variety of salads and desserts. A big shout out to Ramiero, Marcos and Nestor who took care of us through breakfast, lunch and dinner at the buffet restaurants. The catamaran was great fun, my son had enough of kayaking with his mother, both kids loved the paddle boat. There were snorkelling, parasailing and wave running available at a fee. By North American standards this would not be a 5 star hotel but it was more of a 3 1/2 or 4 star and for the money it was well worth it. Very safe, very clean and quite enjoyable. Lots of variety at the restaurants. Make your stay more enjoyable - when you see good service reward it early on and you will be taken care of - don't overtip and don't tip every time you get a drink but watch how hard these people work and reward them accordingly as well as your chambermaid.

We knew we liked the Mayan Riviera as we visited there a few years ago and this trip just reminded us how much we loved it. And the Riu was fantastic. What stood out most to me (aside from the obvious, like the beautiful beach and pool) was the food. I usually find resort food to be low quality but not here. It was very well prepared and there was a huge selection. Nice to have so many fruits, veggies and fish options as I don't eat chicken, pork, or beef. My daughter always found something she liked on the buffet as well. In fact, the buffet was so good, that we only took advantage of the a la carte option (Mexican) one night. Keep in mind that no matter how good the food is, after so many days, you do get tired of it. But it was definitely the best of any resort we've visited. The night we went to the Mexican restaurant was my husband's birthday and the staff surprised us with a song and delicious cake-- a very nice touch. The drinks are the usual sugary pre-mixed ones, but we did find a great Pina Colada in Playa del Carmen. The beach was great and our daughter (11 yrs) liked the boogie boards, snorkelling (though there is not much to see) and the pottery painting stand near the beach. When we first arrived (late at night) the assigned us to a room in the 1000 block of rooms (first building on the right as you leave the lobby) and had to be moved because it smelled bad and it was so close the dining room. Ended up in the 4000 building and loved it. no problems. Midway b/w pool and main building. The resort is a nice size; you really don't walk far to anything and it was good for families as it was easy to keep an eye on our daughter. We only went to one show. It was so-so. A lot of lip syncing and a bit of dancing. She didn't take part in the kids programming; the area for them was pretty small and she preferred to stay with us.

After reading several reviews on trip advisor we picked this hotel as it seemed to have the best of both worlds - the Riu Playacar is the smaller quieter hotel on the Playcar complex but we also had the use of other busier Riu hotels as well (Riu Yucatan and Riu Tequila). Had read some mixed reviews but we were really, really pleased. All of the Mexican people are lovely and this hotel is great value for money. You won't be disappointed by the selection of food and drinks (including international brands if you wanted - just ask for them). Be prepared though...I had a Smirnoff Vodka and Sprite but I couldn't actually taste the Sprite!! You have been warned!! ;-)) The hotel is set within the Playacar complex and it's great because you can choose from different Riu bars and entertainment each night, still part of your all inclusive (you do have to eat your evening meals at your own hotel though). Our hotel had 3 speciality restaurants (again part of all inclusive) Steakhouse, Mexican and Asian. We tried the Steakhouse which was nice to have waiter service and be in a different setting not far from the beach. The day we tried to book for the Asian restaurant they said they were doing Asian night in the buffett restaurant that night anyway so no bookings being taken, didn't get chance to try the Mexican one unfortunately but again always loads of choice on buffett from all cuisines! There were no problems walking around the Playacar complex at night between hotels it was really safe, in fact it felt much safer than some other large European resorts we have visited. It was nice to go the busier hotels and then return to our slightly quieter hotel if we wanted. There are two pools, the noisier one which has the swim up pool bar and all the activities centre around there mainly, although no pressure at all to join in but good fun either way. The other pool is quieter but to be honest we spent most of our time on the beach. The beach, although small, was good with a mix of shady or sunny spots with sunbeds. Due to the strong undercurrent it makes it great fun to bobble about in the sea which was lovely and warm too! Just be careful to keep an eye on the flag system they have in place for when the sea is too rough to swim in, although we only saw this happen once and it was just before a rain storm. There is a lovely massage hut on the beach which is brilliant. I had a fantastic swedish massage which I thought was great value (approx 50 dollars), it added to my lovely relaxing holiday perfectly just drfiting off into relaxation with the sound of the waves crashing in the back ground! If I am being totally honest (and maybe over critical) the only slight let down of this hotel was the rooms, although exceptionally clean they are a little tired and could do with an update to make it even better but hey, you aren't there to spend time in your room. Mini Bar in the room excellent touch for when getting ready to go out at night. Also a slight aside but....for those of you like me who see hairdryer listed in the hotel detals but still take your own because the hotels are usually so rubbish, dont worry and save packing space! The hairdryers are really powerful and placed in front of a big mirror in the bathroom!! The maids are fantastic too, after cleaning the rooms spotlessly they would leave little towel animal surprises in the rooms which was good fun coming back and seeing what had been left each day. We did tip her but only a couple of dollars every few days, as and when we had change, but she worked hard and the surprises were a nice touch. Thanks again Gregoria! As we were only there for a week we only did one trip but it was great and would definately recommend it. It was the Fat Cat Catamaran trip which is just over half day spent on a lovely Catamaran with all inclusive drinks and a packed lunch on board while you sail out to a beautiful snorkelling reef. We were fortunate enough to see turtles while we were snorkelling but even without those its a beautiful reef to snorkel in anyway. On the return journey back you also stop to swim where the cenotes (underground rivers) meet the sea, a kind of lagoon style area not far from the Marina. Even if you aren't keen on the snorkelling (although would try and persuade anyone because its such a lovely reef and the turtles are fantastic to watch!!) its still lovely to just lay on the nets at the front of the boat and get a tan while you are drifting out to sea with a rum punch in your hand! The weather was mixed while we were there, a couple of overcast days but overall I hope you can tell that we had a fab holiday.

There is plenty of seating by the pools or at the beach, but if the hotel is full that may not be the case. There are no Palapas at the beach, but there is a shady area. The catamarans were in good shape which is not the case at all AI resorts. The food is OK/mediocre at best. Anyone who says it is wonderful has never had a really good meal!! I think that because the resort is on the smaller side there is not as much variety as you find in the larger hotels. Dinner and breakfast are only served in the main buffet. Lunch is served only at the poolside/beach restaurant. (another reviewer implied that there is nowhere informal to eat when you are by the water, but that is not true. You do need to put on shoes, but a bathing suit and a cover up are OK). You may go to the Riu Tequila or Riu Yucatan for breakfast or lunch, but not dinner. You will find basically the same food quality, though perhaps a little more variety, at these somewhat larger hotels (I looked). I ate at two specialty restaurants: The Steak House (daytime waterside restaurant dressed up at night) and the Jade Asian restaurant in the lobby. The Steak house was pretty bad though the steak was tender. The Asian restaurant was a bit better. (self serve buffet). The drinks are OK (we are not big drinkers) . The wine at all of these places is so-so. The bread is fresh and quite good. Surprisingly there were some very good desserts including Carrot Cake and Chocolate Cake. Ice cream was yummy. Lots of tasty fresh fruits and vegetables. Mexican food at the buffet was OK but bland though there are a variety of hot sauces. The guacamole and salsa were both great . You will not go hungry in any case. The rooms are fine. The beds are hard in all of these hotels. The pillows are not great. The room is attractive. It has a dressing area, toilet and shower. The shower is roomy and has good water pressure. I felt that A/C could have been cooler, though we were never uncomfortable. There is shampoo but no conditioner so bring your own. If you want to go to the spa you will have to walk to the Riu Yucatan. If you want to go to sports bar or nightclub you'll have to go to the Riu Tequila.

The landscaping is beautiful. The rooms were clean and nice. The food was good. The majority of the staff was very nice. The pool was somewhat small, but nice. The beach was nice, but it did have the giant sandbags surrounding it. The complaints that I would have about the resort is the typical cancun/carribean resort annoyances such as: 1) Having to have 'beach towel cards' to trade in for clean towels. The resort states that they will charge you $20 per towel card that you don't turn in at the end of your stay. We did have a towel stolen from a nearby chair, but luckily we found an abandoned towel later to trade in for a 'towel card'. 2) The speciality restaurants have limited seating, and you must sign up for these restaurants early the morning of the evening you wish to dine. Also, not all of the specialty restaurants are open every night. The other minor complaints that I would have are: 1) The shows starting times are somewhat late; 9:45 p.m., which is late if you have kids. 2) There are no waiters/waitresses to bring drinks to you poolside or beachside. 3) There is no poolside or beachside grill, so if you want to eat lunch, you have to completely dry off and have shirt, shoes, etc. 4) The kids play area is very tiny, and the kids activity program is poor. 5) There are many topless women beachside and poolside, which did not bother us, but some families may not approve. 6) The fitness center is actually 2 resorts away, which is some distance. 7). The drive to the resort is about 1 hour from the airport, and many resorts are much closer. But, again, a very nice resort for adults and teenage children. P.S. BE WARNED of the shops across the street from the resort. Our teenage daughter and her friend were falesly accused of stealing some cheap bracelets by a small shop owner. The girls had money and have never stolen anything before. The girls offered the shopowner to search through their stuff to, but she claimed that they could have hidden the bracelets somewhere. The shop owner changed her story that the girls stole 2 bracelets, then 4, then 6, then back to 4. The local mecixan police showed up and made the girls pay $60 for the 4 bracelets (that were no where to be found), or they would go to jail. The girls had bought bracelets earlier on the trip at these shops for $5-$8, but the 'stolen bracelets' were suddenly $15 each.

You don\u2019t have to pay for a single other thing, they even give you fresh beach towels every day. We spent no money except for going to Coco Bong the club which is amazing. We went with the entertainment staff which get you into the VIP areas and are not dodgy in the slightest (unless you want them to be). Look out for the sandwiches at reception when you come in from the night clubs! There constantly have day time activities on and hotel is right on the beach so you wont be bored. The evening shows are ok but only on for hour or so but afterwards I recommend going across the road to the Tequila hotel which as a small disco and is still in your all inclusive. Or wait in the reception bar and the entertainment staff will take you to Coco Bong or the club next door (can\u2019t remember its name) which are both good! I would say slightly older people could go to Coco Bong as it has shows and entertainment on where as the other on is a night club just for dancing. Only bad thing I can comment on is that the air con isnt great but works and does the tick in your room but all other aresa at night can be roasting! Loved Mexico and the Rui hotels although Playacar is without a doubt the best one! Would definitely go back tomorrow!

We had 4 people in our group - 24yrs, 43yrs, 57yrs and 60yrs. This is a small resort. It has 6 buildings for lodging, the lobby which has the restaurant, bar, small store and area where you meet your travel reps, another restaurant down by the beach area, 2 pools (medium size) and another bar next to the stage for entertainment. My biggest disappointment were the rooms. I would compare the rooms to a Motel 6. Each room has double beds pushed together. We were told they don't have king size beds like we requested. This resort appears to be an older resort. My shower had a lot of rust around the drain. There is NO tub and towels had a mildew smell. The beds were hard as a rock and the pillows weren't any better. The employees of the resort are great. Very friendly, very helpful. Our favorite was Aldo at the front desk; Daniel and Alexx at the lobby bar and Isreal (one of the activity people). The beach is BEAUTIFUL. There are chairs to relax in and catch the rays. You have all sorts of non-motorized sports and you can also pay $$$ for other activities. When you're on the beach - tops are optional. It didn't bother me but just letting you know. They have daily activities starting at 10:30 each morning. Some include - stretching, water aerobics, horseshoes, learn spanish, volleyball, waterpolo, dance lessons and more. They try to keep you busy all day. One of your activity people is Isreal. He cracked us up. They work hard to make you enjoy your visit. If you want a list of activities, look on the board by the lobby restaurant and i think there's a small list on the front desk. I saw a tennis court and know you can visit the other neighboring Riu's for things to do. Al a carte restaurant is located in the lobby restaurant. They had Steak night - Mexican night and maybe Seafood night. We only did the Steak night. Weren't really impressed with the food but that's just us. You do get salad, soup, bread, steak w/ half potato, small piece of corn and small dessert. The pools were ok - one has a swim up bar and they do some of the activites from this one. And then a smaller one that attaches to it. Lots of places to sit and recline. Some have shade. The water wasn't crystal clear like I've seen at other resorts. The food in general wasn't anything to write home about. I'm a little picky of an eater. This is my 3rd year going to Playa del Carmen area. My first year was the Barcelo Tropical - 2nd year was Sandos Playacar and now Riu Playacar. For the price comparison, I'll be going back to the Barcelo. It is higher quality - better food - bigger resort. If you want a basic resort (no frills) close to 5th Ave for shopping or catching the ferry to Cozumel, or just staying on the beach this is for you. If you want a little more luxury and attention I suggest staying somewhere else.", "Date": "October 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cMost fun vacation ever!!\u201d", "Author": "KarenMissingMexico", "ReviewID": "UR47021005", "Content": "I have been to Mexico many times and loved it but nothing compares to this trip to RIU Playacar.

We stayed there from August 21-29, 2009 and had a a great time. At first my husband and I were not sure how this vacation was going to work for us because of our children's age but the staff made our vacation possible. We are already making plans to go back next year. We were very please with the hotel especially the staff. I would like to give credit to Jessica from the kids mini club. Jessica came to me the first day while I was at the adults pool watching my son and told me that they had kids activities from 10am-12pm and then again from 3-5pm. At first I took my son and stayed with him at the kids pool because I didn't think he would want to stay without me. From that day on he would wake up in the morning and after breakfast he would ask to be taken to his \"teacher Jessica's\" class and with his new friends. For the afternoon class she would take them to the stage and practice with them from modeling to dancing so they could participate on stage for the night show. All the little club kids would sit together in front of the stage every night to watch the show. While my son enjoyed his time my husband and I relaxed on the pool or the beach a close distance where we could watch my son play and have fun. My 19 year old son just didn't want to come back home. My son knows spanish but limited and I was just afraid for him to go clubbing by himself. Hugo and the rest of the pool animation guys made him feel comfortable and would go with him and everyone wanting to go to clubs after the night show. They went from Coco Bongo's, Dubai, Riu Tequila (accross the street to which we had access priviledges). The RIU ANIMATION TEAM work very hard to keep all age people active with tons of activities everyday on the main pool. They also have a separate pool where people that prefer to read or relax without being disturbed could go to. THE FOOD was excellent! The buffet had variatey of food and drinks. Real homemade taste to everything from pasta to mexican food. The open restaurant close to the pool had cocktail food. They also have 3 bars through out the hotel. You see staff is constantly cleaning from rooms, restaurants, pool area and beach area. THE NIGHT SHOWS are excellent entertainment. On Friday's they have a Traditional Mexican Day where they have a Mariachi trio at the restaurant and a live Mariachi Band at the Night show. A Dance group dances to a different theme every night. My best show was the movie theme dances where they danced to the Titanic movie. They also have other traditional bands before and after the show that sing to salsa, cumbia and merengue. THE ROOM was a good size with 2 full sized beds next to each other. It has a well stocked mini bar in the room that gets refilled every 2 days but you may call the receptionist desk at anytime you wish to get it refilled. My son loved to come to the room and find a different animal made out of towels. One day he cried when he forgot his Curious George in the room and when we opened the door, there in the corner of the bed we found that the cleaning people had made a monkey friend and sat them hugging next to each other in the corner of the bed. This made my day! So in all YES, I recommend RIU Playacar for all ages. All inclusive, Free transportation to and from airport, Great staff, Nice beach next to a beautiful turquoise water, Good food, Free water sports (kayaking, pedal boat, snorkeling classes, etc...), Tons of activies in and around the pool, Great night shows, Excellent kids club, etc..", "Date": "September 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "swansea wales uk", "Title": "\u201cexelent and very clean\u201d", "Author": "martin,pritchard", "ReviewID": "UR42453542", "Content": "Just returned from this hotel Check in is very fast with no hassle Staff are very friendly and nothing is to much trouble The food is excellent wit a wide choice to chose from The pool is very clean The beach is also quite nice And the animation team are fun they work very hard and are very good at there job if you want to get involved if not they wont bother you", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dragon from Cardiff", "Title": "\u201cRecommend this place to anyone thinking of going to Mexico...\u201d", "Author": "G-Man68", "ReviewID": "UR41608399", "Content": "Well what can I say almost everything about th stay was amazing.

All of the staff at the resort were friendly, helpful, and very appreciative of their guests. The grounds were well maintained and clean. THe rooms were extremely clean and the air conditioner was definitely working!! It was quite and relaxing. The small size of the resort lent itself to creating a very cozy and relaxing atmosphere. We especially liked that we could use all of the facilities in the RIU Tequila and RIU Yucatan, except for dinner. Each RIU is different in its own way and you can hop from one to the other depending on your mood and interests. FOOD: The food was great. The breakfast buffet was the best. They have great natural fruit juices as well as an omellete station. Lunch was also great, including the ocassional BBQ on the beach. Snacks were available between all meals. The buffet dinner, in our opinion, was better than the only ala carte dinner (the steakhouse) we tried. The steakhouse was average, but we still enjoyred it because it was nice eating by the beach. The buffet had a variety of option even during theme nights. The service from the waiters was great as well. Even if you get hungry in the middle of the night you can get snacks at the sports bar located at RIU tequila across the street. POOLS and BEACH: Most people seem to linger in the pool with the bar where they have alot of activities held by the entertainment team. If you want to sit by a quiet and relaxing pool then you have the option to hang around the other pool next to it. However, you also have access to the RIu yucatan and Riu Tequila pools which seem to be more lively and louder. The beach in front of the RIU Playacar was amazing. There were plenty of chairs and it was never crowded. The water was always warm and you could swim with fishes. DRINKS & ENTERTAINMENT: We took full advantage of the unlimited access to the bars in all three resorts. The drinks were great and definitely not watered down. We loved the minibar in the room even though we never used it because we preferred to go get drinks at the bar in the lobby which was open 24 hrs. We also enjoyed the Pinata bar at the RIU tequila one night, as well as the sports bar there. The nightly shows were great at the RIU playacar, but we preferred the ones at the RIU Tequila. Since the RIU PLayacar seemed to become very quite after dinner and had little night life, the Tequila was the place to be after dinner. However, if given the option again we would still stay at the RIU Playacar because of its small size, cozy atmosphere, relaxing environment, and great service. We would recommend going to the Tequila for nightlife, but returning to a less crowded and more quite resort at the Playacar to get a good night sleep. Overall, we thought the location of the resort was perfect because it is a 5 min ride away from Playa del Carmen terminal. In addition, the little shopping center in front of the resort has everything you need (i.e. souvenirs, pharmacy, calling cards, etc). TRANSPORTATION: Before taking the trip I thoroughly researched methods of transportation from the airport. Even though private shuttles seem to be quite affordable because of the safety they offer, Playa del Carmen was very safe in our opinion. We opted for taking the ADO bus right outside the airport. The buses leave once every hour and costs 9 pesos, which is super cheap. The buses were super comfortable, fast, and safe. The bus left us right on 5th avenue at the ADO bus terminal. As soon as you come out of the terminal you see a cab stop where you can take cabs that are licensed by Playa. All of their cars are the same and labeled. From there you can take a cab for 50 pesos to RIU playacar. EXCURSIONS: We definitely recommend booking an excursion with Edventure Tours. We spent an entire fun filled adventurous day with a small group of people and a great guide for only 100 dollars (not including tip and lunch). They picked us up early at our hotel. We visited the Tulum ruins and had enough time to take a swim in the beach there to cool off. We were then taken to zip line and jump off a cliff into a natural pool with fish. They also took us snorkeling to the Dos Ojos cenotes. After that we had lunch at a great restaurant on the beach. After the beach the rest of our group went to snorkel with turtles, but we waited for them on the beach and took a nap on the hammocks. Being that the you have the option to customize the tour according to your interests we opted for not doing the turtles. The day ended with snorkeling in a lagoon that had a ton of wonderful and colorful fish. This was def the highlight of the day. For an extra 15 dollars we had the guide take our pictures with his waterproof camera, and were given a dvd with pics at the end of the day before we were taken to our hotel. This was def the best place to book an excursion with. We had wonderful expriences, great service, and found it to be very affordable.", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cStill LOVE the RIU playacar\u201d", "Author": "travilin1", "ReviewID": "UR38636902", "Content": "We just returned from our SIXTH visit at the RIU Playacar. We always have a great stay and the staff takes excellent care of us. I don't understand how so many people can write negative comments about this resort!!! The front desk is very helpful. We got upgraded to a junior suite for free when we checked in. We booked our vacation through Orbitz, and the rep was never in the lobby. The front desk was very helpful and called the Orbitz rep and arranged a meeting for us. We really enjoyed our room upgrade. The junior suites have much more room than the standard rooms, and they have a bathtub. The beds are a little bit hard and the pillows are a little flat. All we had to do was call and have more pillows sent to us, and there was no problem. Now for something a lot of people have questions about, the BEACH! We were very surprised on this stay at the RIU Playacar, we were used to the beach being a little smaller and having more sandbags with each visit, but the sandbags are working and the beach had built up a lot from our last stay!!!! The food is always great at the riu. All of the restaurants are delicious! I'd have to say the Mexican and the Asian are my favorite though. There are so many different options for food here, i don't see how you could go hungry here!! I defiantly recommend trying the banana smoothie they have at breakfast and the butter pecan ice cream at the dinner buffet! I wish I had some right now!!! The entertainment staff always has something go on, usually around the pool. We had a lot of fun playing games with the animacion staff throughout our stay. The shows at night we very entertaining. The animacion staff also organizes nights out to clubs in Playa del Carmen. All in all, the resort is incredible. My family and I have visited 6 times, and this visit certainly won't be our last.

Sure, this Riu might not be as extravagant as Tequila, Yucatan, etc. But I liked its quaint and mellow vibe. It captured the interest of all travelors: if you are with family, the resort is very family friendly and has tons of activities/shows for children to get involved; if you are wanting peace and quiet, you can definitely get that; if you want excitement and partying, they have activities and bars geared for you (not to mention that 5th Ave has night life such as Senor Frogs and Carlos-N-Charlies). The staff is very prompt and respectful. I was given help whenever I needed it, they refilled the fridge, towels, and anything else. The rooms were very clean; however, the outside of the rooms were not as clean as they could have been, but still nothing disgusting. The only negative about the rooms was the echoing. If you wanted really good sleep it might be difficult if someone is drunk at 3:00am screaming for about an hour (this only happened once so it was not an ongoing occurance). This was not only my first trip to Mexico, but also my first trip out of the States. I was given several lectures before traveling because it was just me and my female friend going together. Honestly, I felt more safe at this resort than I do sometimes in America. The staff is incredibly respectful and want to make sure you have a great time.

We had never been to the Caribbean before but fancied having a special holiday. We decided on Riu Playacar as at the time I worked in a travel agent and my manager had been a rep in the area. We were attracted to the fact that it is the smaller of the three hotels. Our room was nice and clean. I was a bit nervous about the beds after reading the reviews but was pleasantly surprised. Yes, they're not like your bed at home but they weren't a problem. I think the minibar was restocked every other day. The fridge contained water, different types of pop and obviously corona. Throughout our stay, all the staff were fantastic. We were told that we would get more attentive service in the restaurant if we tipped one of the waitors a higher tip to start with. However, we found that he then expected a higher tip every night and got a bit mardy to start with! Other than that, all the staff couldn't help you enough. The animacion team were brilliant and full of energy. One of the boys in particular took a shine to my boyfriend which I enjoyed winding him up about. They were always friendly, going out of their way to find out your name and getting everyone to join in the activities. It can get a bit annoying after a while but I found that pretending to be asleep when they were on their rounds usually worked. We did a couple of the trips available. Would recommend the night out in Cancun but I would have preferred longer in coco bongo rather than moving on to pat o'briens. We also went swimming with the dolphins, manatees and sea lions. It was an amazing experience and since then I love manatees. Everyone says how ugly they are but I don't think you can understand until you've met them! It was also nice to walk into Puerto del Carmen which was a lot bigger than I thought. It was nice to look around the shops and have a few drinks. Only went at night once as we figured we had already paid for the we could drink at the hotel! The miami vice drinks were amazing. Didn't think the drinks were watered down. The tequila definitely wasn't as I had to spend a day in the room with a hangover one day!

They always took care of whatever we requested in a timely manner. We were also expecting a hot room, based on complaints about the A/C, and got the opposite, we woke up cold often. As far as cleanliness of the property goes, it is not immaculate, but the staff does work hard and any rust, etc. is likely a result of the ocean air.

For those of you who are young and looking for an affordable getaway with friends, this is a good place to go. There seemed to be something for everybody, regardless of age. If low-key is your style, it is quiet enough for you, if you like to party, the lobby bar stays open all hours and so does Playa itself. Also this is a small resort, therefore if you like a more intimate feel, this resort may be for you. All in all, we had a great time, and I would be willing to stay at the Playacar again.

The Riu Playacar is more like a 1 star hotel than a 3 or 4 which I saw on the internet. First the man at the reception desk was rude then we discovered that there were no bellman. We had to drag our bags up to the third floor with no air conditioning. The room was smelly and the air conditioning didn't work. We asked them to check it while we were at lunch (which was terrible) which they didn't. When we got back we called again and they changed the thermostat. That did not make a difference. We went to the desk and spoke to the manager who assured us that it was working but that they could not lower the temperature any more because they had rules about that. We asked to be moved to another Riu property but they could'nt do that because the reservation desk was closed for the night! The room did not cool off all night. The next day I called our travel agent who switched us to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya (which is wonderful). We were to pay the difference, which at this point was fine because we were so miserable. We later found out through our travel agent that the Riu Playacar had had so many complaints that they were going to cover the extra cost for our move. She also found out that they had had air conditioning problems for two months so the manager had lied to us. We are apprciative of the fact that they covered our upgrade but this resort should not be rated above a 1 star. In conclusion, The Riu Playacar had these issues: The food was terrible, room dirty and smelly, the drawers in the dresser were broken, the pool was dirty and was not cleaned over night, the receptionist was very rude when we checked in and the air conditioner did not work even when they said it did!

And yet I was so disappointed with this middle-of-the road resort. Aside from well-groomed grounds, a nice beach and some friendly/hardworking staff, I have nothing good to say. Our room was musty and moldy the entire time. I have terrible allergies, and woke up congested every morning. We complained; they sprayed the room; the smell lingered. Our showerhead was broken, and the shower didn't drain well. We complained three times, and they never fixed it. One morning two people from the front desk called our room three times from 7:30 to 7:45 while my friend and I were trying to sleep. They asked if our doorknob needed to be fixed. (No, no, no.) When we complained in person, they denied it, apologized and said they were probably prank calls. The food was absolutely terrible. My friend's regular diet consists of kid food (hamburgers, pizza, french fries, etc.), and even she was disgusted. I eat everything, and I never had a satisfying meal. The Tequila had the same food, but it was much better. The pool is old, dirty and badly in need of renovation. It is SO BORING. There is nothing to do. The entertainment is so-so. If you're in your 20s or if you have kids, go to the Tequila. The pool at the Tequila is great, there are lots of activities and the entertainment was so much fun. It's not on the beach, but there's a big golf cart that takes you to a nice-sized beach next to the Playcar. If you're on a budget and just want a fun, decent place to stay, please choose the Tequila or another resort.", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "North carolina", "Title": "\u201cDO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.

Needless to say this was one of the worst vacations I, my family, and friends have ever been on. When we arrived to the hotel they told us the check in time was 3:00 so we patiently waited for an hour until 3:00pm. When I went to the desk they still weren't ready for us to check in. In the meantime I see other people being checked in so I'm wondering why are we having to wait out in this heat. So while we're sitting and sweating to death and can't wait to get to our room with air conditioning, we had to wait for about another 30-45 min. Finally we get checked into our rooms and the first thing my mom sees when she gets to her room is a toilet pulled out from the wall with some man in her room trying to fix it. So we were told it was ok to check in and then my mom's room doesn't have a working toilet. The man just leaves the room and doesn't say what's going on. Then we all notice that none of the air conditiong (a/c) in all 3 rooms doesn't work. The next thing we notice is that all the rooms smell like a sewer the bedsheets smell like mildew. So I go back to the front desk to let them know what's going on. They let my mom switch rooms and tell us they will send someone to fix the air. At this point I call my travel agent Kasey Davis (Mann Travels, hickory, NC) to tell her what is going on. I couldn't stay on the phone long because it costs 99 cents per min to call home from my cell phone. We end up getting disconnected and I didn't get to speak to her anymore. Then the manager tells me he is calling US Airways because I want to switch hotels at this point. The lady on the phone was speaking Spanish which I do not understand. I asked her to give me someone who spoke English and then she hung up on me. So I guess the manager thought telling us he would give us another room with air the next day would make everything ok. So the whole first day was wasted trying to get a room without a sewer smell and a/c. So the next day we go back up to the front and they let us check out our new rooms before we packed up all of our stuff to move. The rooms were exactly the same as the ones we were in. So for 5 days we had to live with mildew sheets and no a/c and rude management who could have cared less whether we were satisfied. I wouldn't go back to this place if it was given to me for free. I don't know what you can do for me but something needs to be done or compensated for the amount of money we spent on our first vacation out of the country.

The food at the Playacar is the best of any resort I've stayed (including the Riu Palace Riviera Maya). I definitely recommend the night buffet over the gourmet restaurants. The gourmet restaurants are very good, but, you won't get anything there that you can't get at home. At the buffet I had calamari (sauteed and fried), oysters on the half-shale (with an incredible sauce), octopus, delicious soups, and, great fruits and veggies. The beach is large and not crowded. There is ample shade from coconut trees. Likewise, there is ample shade around the pool. The service at the bars was excellent. The staff does a good job of offering activities (water aerobics, volleyball, soccer, water basketball and more). The nightly shows are a little cheesy--but fun! The Michael Jackson Tribute had lots of people up dancing!! The resort is doing a major upgrade on its air conditioning and I had to change rooms when I first arrived, because the one I initially was in had a temperature of 84. After the move, I had no problems. The water pressure was good (as it's always been). The cleaning crew and the staff that restocks the mini-fridge were excellent. And, there were six single women for every single guy; what more could a boy want? I go to Playa 5-6 times a year, and I've never had a bad stay at a Riu. Also, the Playacar now has free wireless Internet in the lobby. It's very fast (I'm guessing G or N band)! Finally, if you're a diver, check out Phantom Divers in town. They are 35% cheaper than the folks at the hotel, and Charlie is the best Dive Master I've ever gone out with (and I have over 300 dives).", "Date": "July 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cTristan,s dream holiday!\u201d", "Author": "LadyJEngland", "ReviewID": "UR35532257", "Content": "We stayed here with our family the first 2 weeks in July.

We were not disapppointed - everyone had a wonderful time! If we were picky we would refurbish the rooms' but this is not a Riu Palace hotel and we didn't pay Palace hotel prices. The gardens were immaculate - a definite plus for us gardeners! We have never been to a hotel with better staff - every one of them were marvellous! In our view this is what makes a perfect holiday! Our grandson Tristan was one of our group. He has special needs and it isn't always easy for him to 'fit in'. At this hotel he had the most wonderful time of his life! The staff were amazing - including him in every activity and game and helping him out in the dining rooms and at the bar.

My husband & I have been going to Mexico for more than 10 years and have stayed at various other resorts. We definitely rank this resort in the top 3 and this resort has become our Playa Del Carmen destination. It is a small resort and easy to get around. Not more than 5 minutes walk to the lobby, beach, pool or resturants. We were greeted immediately and given a welcome drink and our bags were taken to our room within 10 mins. The staff is freindly and helpful. The resort was about 40% full. We met people from all over the US & Europe. ROOMS: The Rooms are nice, with a stocked fridge and bar. They provide soap, shower gel and shampoo. AC isn't the greatest, but we found if you close the blackout drapes and kept the fan running during the day, we could keep the room comfortable. The beds are very firm, but we're used to that and had no trouble sleeping. The room was cleaned each day and the fridge refilled every other day. They made different towel creations every day which was a nice touch. FOOD: The food was really good. And we've eaten at a lot of different resorts, so we understand resort food. The buffet has plenty of selections every night and the food is probably one of the best we've had at a resort. They opened one ala carte resturant per night and you need to make reservations at the coffee station in the buffet resturant in the morning. We did the Steak resturant. It was well presented, and tastey. Don't expect a 2\" thick fillet mignon, but I had the sirloin (rare) which was good and could cut it with a butter knife. DON'T BE LATE! These are timed dinner events and if you get there after they serve the 1st course, they may not seat you. ENTERTAINMENT: WOW! The entertainment staff work so hard! Hello to Hugo, Chuy, Isreal. There is always something going on... darts, horseshoes, ping pong, bocce ball. You can participate as much as you want to. At the main pool, there will be water aerobics, water volleyball, water polo, water games, trivia bingo, etc, etc, etc. If you want quiet, go to the quiet pool. The pool bartenders are excellent, quick to smile and join in on the fun! Watch out for water spray from the bar! They'll make the drinks to your liking, you just have to ask nicely. Ola to Santiago, Nelson, Polo, and Felix - they are the best! And our favorite La Cumbia Bar waitress - Adriana. Behind that sweet smile lurks a real prankster! The nightly shows are very well done. Do not miss the comedy night. I laughed so hard my sides hurt! GENERAL: In general, this was a good, small resort and we loved it.

Beds are rock solid but if you ask at reception they will supply you with a sponge like matress at no extra cost .....BEACH:-Beautiful, loads of sun beds and water sports,nobody hasseling you to buy there items, I spotted 2 people selling Jewellry,but they just asked and went no hassle atall, the sea is turquoise and so clear but always has life guards on duty..There is black sand bags around to stop errosion of the beach but these also stops the bigger waves crashing through so would say this is a safe beach but be aware of the undercurant hence the red flags,they will still let you swim with the red flag but not as far as you could...Pool:-3 pools all very clean,main one is activity so can be very busy this is also where the Jacuzzi is located & pool bar is,never found it a problem being served as always about 3 staff on duty,the 2nd pool is similar size very quiet,ideal if you want to read and relax as the staff dont go round this side to ask if you want to join in the games they just leave you to relax & enjoy 3rd pool is a tiny splash pool for the really young ones ideally situated next to the beach and the childrens playground..TRIPS:-Reps will tell you not to book with anyone else but with them,but if you want value for your peso/dollar you would be well advised to either cross the road and talk to the local people selling trips or for 50 pesos/$5 thats about \u00a33.50 get a taxi to 5th Avenue and get your trips sorted out down there & save your self alot of money.5th avenue is Brilliant full of bars clubs expensive and not so expensive shops, great restaurants ask at hotel for a taxi its safe quick & reliable, by the time they put the phone down the Taxi will be there under a minute, brilliant service....or if you are feeling that energetic how about walking to 5th Avenue would take you about 25 minutes but in that heat I would personaly take the airconditioned cab myself...xcaret a must tour is an eco park where you can swim in underground rivers etc there is so much to do here will seriously need 2 days but as its only up the road from playacar its a real easy option...if excitment is your game try the speed boat tour and be james bond for a day its fast and furious and brilliant fun and a word of warning, when they take you to your snorkeling area there is no platform to get off, you just slide off your speed boat so no platform to get back on and trying to get back into your speedboat takes a little perseverance so not for the panicky or the person with no upper body strength but still a great trip...If you fancy the night life there is a barcrawl trip to cancun where they take you to 4 clubs the last one being the famous coco bongos where the film THE MASK was filmed...I wouldn't bother on this trip please dont waste your money, They pick you up outside your hotel at 7.15 pm it takes about an hr and a half to get there, its gone nine before you get in the 1st club which aint all that great, its not untill you get to go to coco bongos does it start to get good about 12.00am then by the time your are getting warmed up you have to meet back at the coach at 1.15am for your long journey back in the coach of another hr and a half....someone chucked up in the coach so the smell was just awful so i suggest this....Group of you all get a taxi for about 9.00 they do about 10 seater taxis all chip in....wont take an hr and a half in a taxi not they way they drive,Coco Bongos show doesnt start untill 10.30.... tickets for COCO BONGOS..sunday mondays tuesdays wednesdays are $50 u.s and thursday friday saturday are $60 u.s...or if you fancy the club and not the drive COCO BONGO has just opened a new club in playa del carmen a little smaller than the one in cancun by just as wild and did i mention all your drinks are included in that price aswell.....getting back to the hotel...The annoying bad bits:- ANTS EVERYWHERE AROUND THE POOL....little bleeders and they nip..Mosquitoes,i have never been bitten so many times..Lizards(IGUANAS) cute to look at but they are wild animals people so dont feed them,more important dont drop food in the open air restaurant as you may find them around your feet as they do seem to like chips lol..BIRDS..they have no fear and have a tendency to go for your chips or spaghetti in the open air restaurant lol....WINE...They seem to keep it way to long in a plastic jug so the majority of the time it has oxidised and only tastes good if poured on chips if you get my drift, so what we did instead of getting wine from the bar they allowed us to get it from the actually wine barrel it self that is located in the turgesa bar and restaurant and that was actually very nice....These are the only things i can seriously think to moan about but apart from those few trivial things its a fantastic place to holiday I would go again in a heartbeat....Almost forgot DONT!!....Whatever you do come here in the American Spring Break unless you are one of those who are on it as it can get exceptionally loud as the young Americans who cant drink over there come here because the drinking age is 18 so be aware and ask your travel agent when spring break is before booking this

Not one for the animation teams etc but that's just us, so we tended to stay in the top pool or on the beach most of the time. Very dissapointing trip to Chimin Itza, coach drive was 3.5 hours each way at a cost of $99 each, which th guide made no bones about saying that it didn't include tips and was expecting more than bell boy tips for the effort they put in (I think it's called a job over here!!). Anyway apart from the ruins the place is infested with flea markets which obviously they forget to put in the brochures, really made the day hard work, don't mind them earning a crust but maybe outside the seventh wonder of the world (unless thay were it). Maids were brilliant and they did a model of a different animal or bird out of the towels they refreshed everyday, and left on the beds with flowers and petals surrounding their creation. Apart from the mini bar fridge which was nicely stocked, the rooms also boasted an optics bar with brandy, vodka, whisky and rum. These they told us would be replaced or topped up every two days but weren't. I questioned this twice with reception, it was duly noted and then not actioned on. I wouldn't have minded if they hadn't made such a big thing about it on arrival. That said we would definately go back again, although I must say it was the hotel and staff that swung it for me and not the beach, would sooner be in the Dominican, hands down for that. So maybe a RIU hotel in the Dominican would be perfect. Anyway thanks to all the staff at RIU Playacar but where's my mini-bar optics?

Value for money: excellent So where to start?!?! Travel: We travelled from Glasgow airport to Cancun Airportwith thomson holidays. Luckily everything went without a hitch, no delays or anything. The only problem we had was a rowdy wedding party on our plane which was a bit testing as we were stuck with them for the full 10hours! We arrived at the airport and had to fill out little forms regarding swine flu and then it was straight to immigration. Ive flew to America several times so i assumed it would be as long and strict as it is there but i was wrong. I think we queued for 10mins and that was that. We had our temperatures taken and handed in the health forms and then went through to baggage area. I think we were just having some extreme luck because our cases were there as soon as we got there! When you get to customs you put your case through xray machine...make sure you do it one by one as they get a bit pissed off if too many people are trying to get their bags through. You press a button and they randomly select whos bag gets searched. My suitcase got searched. It was a bit of a joke to be honest as they opened the case, peered in and then let me go. Once through customs do not stop to talk to anyone. There are sooo many people trying to sell timeshares and as long as you dont stop they dont tend to bother you. After them you then have to deal with the guys who take your cases to your bus. We didnt get a chance to say no thanks and straight away that was us spending our money on tips (we tipped 2 dollars). The transfer from the airport took just over an hour and was fine although the driver expects a tip as well. Reception: The reception staff were lovely and when you go to check in you get given a cold drink which was rather tastey! You get a little leaflet with a map of the playacar resort and it has restaurant opening times on it as well. Checking in took us about 10mins. Oh and the best bit... you get your bags taken to your room for you, so no lugging your 20kg cases up 2 flights of stairs! Accommodation: We stayed in block 6 on the top floor. Our room was nice. 2 double beds pushed together, small table and 2 chairs, tv, wardrobe, ironing board and iron, hair dryer, shower, toilet and most importantly minibar! The beds are hard yes , but i found it quite comfortable so no complaints there. Our room was cleaned everyday and we tipped the maid $5 at the start of our first week and then another $7 for the rest. I quite like sittin on the balcony at night usually but theres no light out there so you can't sit and read a book. Worst complaint ever there but i was really struggling to find any faults with the accomodation which is unusual because i usually moan about everything! Pool and Beach: They had 2 pools. One was the quiet one and the other was the one with the bar in it. Guess where i was for the 2weeks? haha nah the second pool had games and stuff going on in and around it which gave you something to watch whilst you sunbathed. We always headed down to the pool around 10 and got sunbeds easily, although sometimes you had to settle for ones without shade but it wasnt that bad. The beach had sooo many sunbeds at all times of the day. The water is so blue and clear, it looks fake its that nice! The massive sand bags are visible but dont ruin the scenery at all, in fact i felt slightly safer that i couldn't float out to really deep water cause of them. We took part in some activities around the pool and beach because you start to feel bad saying no to the entertainment team all the time. I hate all that guff but i actually enjoyed taking part. I took part in aqua aerobics, water polo and water volleyball, don't think i've laughed so much in my life! We also took out some boogie boards to float around the sea on. The guys at the beach water sports area aren't so friendly and dont speak that much english. My boyfriend took out a jetski which are quite pricey but if you haggle with them for more time they usually give in. Food: Food was good. Im pretty fussy whereas my boyfriend will eat anything, but for a change there was soo much that i liked. The breakfast was definately the best meal of the day,ive never ate so much in my life! There was always food even if you turned up 10mins before it was due to shut. We didnt go to any of the a la carte restaurants because we found that the night after a restaurant the buffet one had same food as the night before. Entertainment: The guys work so hard. 6 days a week 10am-11:30pm and they still go out partying! Im not a fan of going to watch the evening shows that hotels put on but i decided to go anyways and they weren't that bad. Most nights they had dancers on and it got a bit repetitive but one night they had a Miss Riu competition which was hysterical and the entertainment team done a few comedy shows. We went out with the entertainment guys and other guests 2 nights in our stay. The first time was to Dubai club which cost $10 for women and $35 for men but it was an open bar and we had our own personal table and waiter. It was like nothing you see back here in scotland. Then 2 nights later we went to coco bongos up at 5th avenue. It was more pricey at $50 each but totally worth it.I didnt finish a single drink as i kept getting handed fresh drinks. Well worth a visit. Excursions: We only done 2 as they are quite expensive and we were having so much fun sitting around the pool we didn't actually want to go out that much. We done the Jungle Tour excursion. It was an hour journey to cancun and then we got our life jackets and snorkel gear and we were away. My boyfriend drove the speedboat out following our tour guide and then we stoppped for 45mins for a snorkel. I drove on the way back. It was so much fun, laughed the whole way back!I would recommend this to anyone, unless your scared of water. We done the Cancun Bar Crawl but didn't have that much fun as the nights out in playacar. It was too hot,too noisy and way too blackpool pleasure beach. 5th Avenue: $5 in a taxi or 50 pesos. Shops are slightly more varied and theres lots of food places and bars. We went out for our dinner on our last night to a place called fusion which is down on the beach. Amazing food and they have live music and you can sit on the beach and eat your dinner. We got starters and main course and 5 drinks between us and it came to around \u00a335. There is a bar which we didn't go to but wish i had that has swings around the bar,looked interesting and fun especially after a few! General: We had one problem in the 2 weeks we were there. Someone had obviously had to much to drink and woke us up at 3am by shouting and being sick in the block we were staying in. i phoned reception and within 20mins the problem was sorted. The next day when we came back up to our room we had an apology note from Riu and a small bottle of tequila. It seems that the riu staff will do anything and everything to make their guests stay as good as possible.

My initial impression of the resort is that it\u2019s lively and authentic. The lobby was an open concept with a bar and traditional yellows, oranges and reds. The path through the hotel buildings was well lit, open and the trees and plants were spread nicely without being overbearing. The hotel buildings were bright and the sun was even brighter. Service What really made the trip so enjoyable was the positive service we received all around from the moment we got there. Hands down every employee I was around was extremely friendly and polite. We had no problem getting service anywhere. I felt I needed to tip everyone because they were all so nice (of course I didn\u2019t go that far). Each Riu Resort had its own entertainment staff of about 3-6 people that coordinated daily activities and handled the nightly entertainment. Activities included water aerobics, volleyball, bingo, bocce ball, free scuba diving lessons, drinking games and more. We didn\u2019t participate in too many of the activities, but the water aerobics was fun. We went to the nightly entertainment two nights. One night was authentic Mexican dancing; the other was made up of dancers recreating scenes from popular movies. Rooms The rooms at the Riu Playacar were very simple and nice. It was musty at first but nothing an open patio door wouldn\u2019t fix. The beds had foam padding for added comfort, beautiful tile flooring, tv, and a mini-bar with four types of liquor, beer, soda and extra large bottles of water. They stock the mini-bar every two days. We only needed to get water and soda stocked all week. They have 6 different buildings (each a different bright color) that have three floors of rooms each with balconies. The buildings are all conveniently located either towards the lobby and buffet area or to the pool area. Pools I would say the two pools at the Riu Playacar were the most simplistic compared to all five of the Riu Resorts we looked at. There was a swim up bar, but no tables/seats in the pool otherwise. It was hard to get a shaded lounge chair near the pool after 11:00 a.m., but we never really needed one anyway. The pools were cleaned at 8:00 p.m. each night, so night swimming was not encouraged. Food and Bar There were three bars that all opened at 10:30 a.m. The lobby bar stayed open then until 7 a.m. the next day, the pool bar until 5:30 p.m. and the entertainment bar until 12:00 p.m. Basically between 7 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. if you\u2019re up for a cocktail you\u2019ll need to take advantage of the mini-bar. The Riu 24-hour All-Inclusive concept was definitely in affect, we never went hungry or thirsty. The food was standard and nothing out of the ordinary. Rice, nachos, refried beans, fish, chicken or beef, burgers, hot dogs, pizza, fruit and desserts were served at every lunch or dinner. The breakfast buffet was the same every day with a wide variety of your standard breakfast meals. I would rate the food a 3.5 out of 5. It was very consistent and we got our fill. The breakfast and dinner buffets were served in the buffet restaurant in the lobby of the resort and the lunch and afternoon snack were served in a buffet/bar area near the pool and overlooking the ocean. They also had 3 ala carte options including a Steakhouse, Asian and Mexican. You just needed to make reservations during the morning for that evening at the breakfast buffet. This was very simple to do and it didn\u2019t seem like it was hard to get reservations any of them. We ate at the Steakhouse one night overlooking the ocean and it was very nice. The ala carte restaurants had two seatings, one at 6:45 p.m. and one at 8:45 p.m. We only did one ala carte option because we didn\u2019t care for the time restraints. Beach The beach was smaller and nice, but eroding like many others. Huge multi-ton sandbags lined the beaches of all of the resorts in this area. The sandbags kept our particular beach from getting many waves, but it was still very relaxing and beautiful. We had absolutely no problem getting a lounge chair. You could use a snorkel for free, as well as kayak and paddle boat when the yellow flags were up. There were also employees working off commission along the beaches to entice you to go parasailing and jet skiing. All-in-all we had an amazing time. We booked our trip with Deals2Cancun.com and everything went great from start to finish.", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel, Beautiful People\u201d", "Author": "Flappygodmother", "ReviewID": "UR29277128", "Content": "Firstly let me start by saying how much I had been looking forward to my trip to Mexico, so when we arrieved at the resort my breath was taken away. We were the last people to be dropped off so we got to see a couple of the other RIU hotels and I think we got the better deal. The whole complex was clean and well managed and the atmosphere was ever so friendly. The rooms are set out in 6 blocks with good sized rooms. The mini bar and optics were regually filled although having the all inclusive option meant we didn't spend much time with a drink in out rooms. The pool and beach are all within easy reach, just a minutes walk from the room and there were no problems with getting a lounger be it at the pool or beach. I have to say the loungers round the pool are a little more comfortable than the ones at the beach, but we spent more time in the water that we didn't notice too much. The food and drink are second to none with excellent buffet selections, howvere the steak house was a little dissapointing with very limited options. We were going to try the other al a carte resturants but due to the swine flu outbreak and the dwindling number of guests only the buffet resturant was kept open ( though we were more than happy with this). The three bars all had a great selection of drinks and the cocktails were great, not drenched in alcohol, which is the last thing you need when you are in need of a refreshing drink. If I could change anything it would be the entertainment, the poolside entertainment was constant, which was good for those who like to always be doing something but when you just wanted to laze by the pool you felt you were constantly being pestered. The evening entertainment was better but not much variety. Overall the holiday was excellent. Good clean rooms and resort, excellent service and upbeat personalities from all the staff. I feel so much forthe staff who are not sure when they will next get visitors in so when you consider a holiday please bear this resort in mind, you will really enjoy it.", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "pa", "Title": "\u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\u201d", "Author": "zbevoman", "ReviewID": "UR29165263", "Content": "Background: My wife and I have been to Cancun 6 times and the Caribe a total of 13 times. So we have considerable experience with AIs throughout this area. We have stayed at Iberostars, rius, bahias, secrets and a few others. The Good- The Riu Playacar is a very nice small resort. For those with walking problems this a great place to stay. The rooms are adequate, nice balcony, food above average for AIs and great friendly service. The pools are clean and well laid out, entire property is spotless and in great condition. The Bad- Not a lot, but some things that might affect your stay. We had a small problem with very small ants in our second floor room always near the liquor dispensers, maybe they had a drinking problem? The musty smell in the room was evident but acceptable for this area. A couple of maintainance problems; the lights in the bathroom all burned out at the same time, it took two calls to get them repaired. The toilet ran after every flush and you would have to jiggle the handle to stop it, again the repairman came after the second call walked into the toilet area and jiggled the handle and said it was fixed. Of course it wasn, we just lived with it. The ac never got cold, and neither did the minibar frig, the repairmen said, that was as good as it gets with these units, so again we lived with it. The only other small complaint was there is no quiet area at the pool area for someone who justs wants to read or nap. The non activity pool had dozens of kids who were just being kids having a good time ,but screaming and running isn't conducive for sleeping and reading. Nothing against kids, we have four with grandkids, but if your are looking for quiet keep looking. The Ugly- We arrived the last week in April, At the height of the swine flu problem. Of course the media reports made it sound like people were dropping in the street. Other than the occasional face masks our stay remained relatively normal. All the quests were of course very concerned and it did put a damper on our vacation, but we just tried to make the best of a very bad situation. My biggest concern was for the thousands of very very friendly mexicans who make their living from the tourist industry. After several hurricanes, the drug wars and now the swine flu you could see the concern on their faces worried that their jobs might be eliminated if the tourists don't return.

This resort was the best one for the kids. There are so many activities for the kids and the adults. My 9yo wouldn't go to the kids club at the Tucan because it was boring for him. Here the kids club was great! Jessica ran the kids club and really did a great job. The kids really loved her and all the activities she planned throughout the day. She actually seeks out the kids and tries to coax them to come to the club. That certainlly wasn't true of the kids club at the Tucan. You can see the kids club from the beach & the pool area which is a plus.The hours are 10-12:30. 3pm -5pm.There is a kids show every night at the theater around 8:30. The rooms were fine. The mattress felt very hard but was fine when you actually laid on it. The shower was slow to drain but we dealt with it. I left a tip in the fridge everyday and it was well stocked. They usually stock it every 3 days but will stock it more if you call or in our case leave a tip. The rooms are very noisy at night you hear everyone in the hallways. The housekeeper did a great job keeeping the room clean. The food was good always plenty. Breakfast was very good and you must try the strawberry milk. YUM!!! Lunch is near the pool each day. We ate at the steakhouse which was good. We had the ribs & ribeye steaks. They are not US quality but were good. The Service is very slow! The asian rest. states it is show cooking. Not true. It was a buffet and you could see them cooking behind the buffet.Almost like a pizza place. Not what I call show cooking. We actually ended up at the buffet afterwards. Reservations are for 6:45 or 8:45pm. The shows at night were ok. Typical of all inclusives. The staff work very hard & we enjoyed the shows we seen. The pool is nice. We stayed at the active or loud pool & enjoyed ourselves. Always activities going on. The crazy games at the pool each day @ 3pm are lots of fun! The bartenders are great. Boy do they work hard. We brought bubba kegs since the cups are small and they kept the drinks nice & cold. The beach was the best one out of the hotels nearby. Lots of chairs available any time of day. There is however no shade at all. We only went to the beach in the morning because of the lack of shade. There was also a red flag 5 out of 7 days. They also offer massage on the beach. This resort was not my favorite out of all of the one's I have been to but was for my kids. I wouldn't stay here if it was just my husband & I but with kids it was perfect.

The other pool was fun for older kids, teenagers and adults who want interaction and fun with others! The pool and beach had plenty of chairs available.

The sand bags do take away from the view a bit but we understand why they're needed to preserve the beach. This is not the resorts fault! We felt safe while vacationing in Mexico!

We liked that there were two pools so our young children (5,3,16 months) could play in the quieter pool while the adults partied and did the games in the other pool. The beach was great, a lot of chairs but they do fill up quickly. Great sand and gorgeous water. The water was a little choppy but my kids did fine with their floaties and the baby was in an inflatable boat that we held on to. She loved the bobbing and fell asleep most times as soon as she got in. The sand bags were out far enough that it didn't matter they were there. They helped break the waves so my kids could play in the water. We stayed at a different all inclusive at one end of 5th avenue last summer and that beach had the sand bags right on the edge of the beach so it was very difficult for the kids to get into the water. Take your leftover bread and fries down to the beach to feed the angel fish. The kids had a blast and loved that the fish would swim around them tickling their legs. The food was good, a lot of variety. My kids loved the ice cream machine. There was always something kid friendly (fries, pizza, plain pasta, chicken). The room was nice. We had the \"king\" bed which was two doubles pushed together. There was still plenty of room for the pack and play that we requested for the baby. I couldn't agree more with everyone saying the beds were extremely hard. We never did ask for a pillow top and we still made it for the week. The room was musty smelling but we were there during such nice weather that we kept the balcony door open for fresh air (which does have a sensor and will shut the air off if left open). The staff is very friendly and do not expect tips but greatly appreciate whatever you give them. A few dollars here and there is not much for us on vacation but a lot to them trying to make a living. They loved the kids and would always stop for a high five and hello. This hotel was so nice for our family because there were so many other families. There was a nice mix of young couples and older couples as well. The shops of Playacar are across the street from the resort. Things were a bit pricey but not much more than 5th Avenue. We didn't want to take the time to go to 5th Avenue because we wanted the beach time, so we went across the street to look for treats but didn't really see anything new and exciting (this was our third trip to Playa Del Carmen) so we didn't buy anything. We did not do any excursions but you definitely had opportunities to take advantage of them from the companies in the lobby. There is also internet service in the lobby.

After much deliberation we chose Riu Playacar for a large family vacation with my 87 year old mother, my kids and their families and my brothers and their families. Some of us were there for 2 full weeks, others for a week, we all overlapped for 3 days. Overall it was perfect. Those who stayed for 2 weeks got tired of the food, it starts to all taste alike after the first week. Plus, we were there over Christmas and I think they skimped before and after the holiday so they could feed us a 'special' meal Christmas eve. Unfortunately a few of our family members were sick after the 'special' meal. The rooms were great, always well cleaned, towel art, flowers, temperature easily controlled. We were right next to the evening disco and it was a great location. Easily accessable to pool and beach and a short walk to the dining room. A bit of a smell from the shower, they came numerous times to fix it but we could still smell whatever. As long as we kept the curtain closed it was okay. Since we had little kids, it was easier to spend more time at the pool than the beach although we took long walks in both directions on the beach every day. The best days were the first week we were there, before the crowds arrived (most of us arrived on Dec 13.) Some of the days they set up a fantastic lunch poolside---paella, barbeque, but once the crowds arrived these wonderful poolside meals moved to the patio with more banquet type food. My granddaughter had fun at the kids club but since she is a very shy 4 1/2 year old she wouldn't go by herself so one of us always accompanied her. But that was fine since a lot of other parents were also hanging around helping the kids every day The mini disco was fun at night, the kids loved dancing on stage. This is a great spot for families with kids, lots of things for them to do and lots of choices for them to eat. We always moved away from the noise at night, wanted to just have a drink and talk away from the loud goings on at the theater. The help was all wonderful. The guys at the beach seemed a little lazy at times, wouldn't help as much as they could have with the kayaks and catamarands. We went on a couple of snorkeling trips, once from a boat we rented as a family off of the beach because the hotel boat was full. It was great, they took us about 15 minutes away down near Xcaret where all the snorkel boats go and let us snorkel as long as we wanted. Had cold drinks to drink on the way home. Price was about the same or a little less than the one from the hotel but they let us stay as long as we wanted. Didn't see as many fish as I did last time I was in Playa, before the Hurricane. The walk to town was 20-30 minutes depending on whether or not we were pushing a baby stroller. We went in often, 5th avenue is a great place to people watch. I took my granddaughter in to have her hair braided and two days later every other girl in the hotel had their hair done too. I think we paid around $25, they looked really cute! Had fun poking in the shops on 5th Ave. There is a nice little shopping center across the street from the hotel. There is a kiosk there where you can check out a clunker bike to ride into town. All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone, especially those with kids and those who want a hassle free all inclusive vacation. It was really nice not worrying about where everyone would eat. A couple of our relatives are vegetarians and they had no trouble finding plenty to eat. We booked our vacation through Apple and the one hassle was our transfer to the hotel. We arrived to Cancun airport around 3:00 PM and were excited that our plane was actually a little early and we would be there in time for a walk on the beach. By the time we waited for all the other people to board the bus it was probably 4:30 before we left the airport and then our hotel was the last drop on the list. We arrived at the Riu after 6 PM! If I had it to do over again I would take that free shuttle that I just read about on a different post or figure out how not to sit on the Apple bus for over 3 hours! The return from the hotel to the airport was better, we only made one stop and then went straight to the airport. Took maybe an hour. Oh yes, I almost forgot. When you check in they tell you about a Riu card that they will give you that gives you a discount on any activity you do that is not in the all inclusive. That proved to be great, gave us a discount on scuba diving (only fair, wouldn't bother next time), snorkeling, computer room, etc. You are welcome to email me with questions.", "Date": "April 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alpena, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cA very good value for a 4 star, but not a 5 star !\u201d", "Author": "GrampaDuck", "ReviewID": "UR27719619", "Content": "My wife & I [ mid -50s ] stayed 7 days here, with our 11 year old granddaughter & her 12 year old BFF. Trip from air port was about 45-50 minutes. Check in at 1:30 PM was fast, but didn't care for the location of assigned room [ Building # 2, ground floor, in back ] very near lobby but farther away from pool & beach area. Returned to see if we could get a room closer to pool & beach, & was resigned a new room, in the middle of ground floor of building # 5, along the front ,which was PERFECT for us, all this took place before 3 PM. We asked for 2 more cots [ 2 twin beds ], for the girls & the people placed these beside the 2 queens & put a chair out onto the patio. Even with the extra beds in the RUN OF THE HOUSE room, we STILL had lots of room. The noise was muffled, and did NOT bother our 9-10 PM bed time. Air conditioning worked good, coldest setting about 72 -73 degrees. Asked for more towels & bottled water & received them. We did not notice a musty smell until we returned home. A few mosquitos, but wasn't bothered by them. Didn't need repellant. Rooms were very clean & cleaned every day. Towels were replaced every day & water restocked every other day. We broght our own 4 cup coffee maker & coffee packets, as no coffee maker in rooms.. Shower was great, with lots of hot water. Buffet food was good. Only bacon at breakfast, no sausages of any kind. Same breakfast buffet every morming. Lunch buffet was the same as dinner the night before. The Steak House had a thin cut of meat, less than a 1/2 \" cut, but some-how they were able to grill it medium rare, but good flavor . The Jade [ asian ] restaurant was very good, [ buffet style ]. Two pools, 1 quiet & 1 party pool. Most of the games, around the party pool were geared toward teens & up. Beach is narrow, compared to others in area, but plenty of sand. The large black sand bags, in the water, did provide protection for the beach & our kids. Lots of wind & fun jumping the 3-5 foot waves, near the shore. We walked the beach for a long way. Riu Yucatan is 3 hotels down from the Playacar, which has a nicer beach, larger variety of foods on the breakfast buffet. We visited Yucatan twice & saw monkeys in the trees, noticed more shade in many areas. Yucatan has 2 swim-up bars,as Playacar has 1, but the Yucatan had more people. Do NOT repend on NW WORLD VACATION / WORRY-FREE reps. for any help, as they only want to be tour salespeople. We consulted with them 4 times about our transport to the airport before departing for the airport & they still did NOT have a van for us at assigned departure time. They finally got us a ride 1 hour later. I was looking forward to a lot of shrimp, crab [seafood ] eating & I was very disappointed. All the staff, room, check-in, dining, cleaning & etc. were very nice & helpful, except for NW World Vacations/Worry-Free. If we go back, we'd try the Yucatan.

First of all, we really enjoyed the vacation \u2013 ocean, sun, and wonderful time together with our granddaughter were priceless. The location of the hotel is very good, it\u2019s quite compact and everything is close \u2013 the whole way from the lobby to the ocean along all 6 buildings (3 on each side of central alley) takes 2-3 minutes. The small shopping center is just across the road from the hotel entrance. The food selection (but not taste) is good, and the buffet style restaurants are very convenient for staying with a child \u2013 much better than any kind of meal ordering system. The hotel has all kinds of motorless water equipment for rent at no charge (sail catamarans, canoes, windsurfing) \u2013 the same way as most of all inclusive hotels in this area have. Training for sailing is not expensive, too, as well as jet ski rent ($65 for 45 minutes, as far as I remember). Now about the problems you will encounter in this place. 1. All beaches on all resorts in this area are destroyed with the huge bags with sand put to the water to protect beach sand from been taken away by sea. They look ugly, they are very dangerous when swimming with waves, and some of them are on the ocean floor in the swimming area \u2013 I had to go to the emergency after hitting toes over one of them. It\u2019s stupid and ugly way of saving money on sand on my opinion. These bags are the reason why we will not go to any resort in this area again. And we heard about the same decision from many people we got acquainted with in this hotel. 2. As I\u2019ve already mentioned, the food selection is good, but cooking is pretty far from perfect. Also, feeding is organized very poorly and there always were the big lines for main course food. Sometimes there was not enough of food, and we had to wait until they cook more. 3. There is really no food between breakfast, lunch and dinner in this hotel \u2013 there is a buffet next to the beach where you can find something, but not sufficient for a hungry person. The room service at nights is also absent \u2013 if you are going to go somewhere early in the morning, you have to let them know a day before not later at 4 pm etc. 4. The hotel is terribly understaffed \u2013 the people are working very hard, but there are not enough of them to do the job. It\u2019s everywhere \u2013 in the restaurants, bars, cleaning team, entertainment etc. 5. Entertainment for children is terrible \u2013 almost the same every day, unprofessional, and even abusive for little ones \u2013 the games they play on half hour evening \u201cmini disco\u201d have one winner among sometimes 20 or more children attending them, and the little ones of course don\u2019t have any chance to win. So, we had a lot for tears from our granddaughter (she\u2019s 6). I think you agree that it\u2019s not very nice to hear from a little child who was supposed to enjoy the show \u201cI am zero, I am nothing, I can never win\u2026\u201d It\u2019s just unprofessional to have this kind of children entertainment. 6. Understaffed cleaning team is working hard to keep the rooms clean, but the rooms are just terribly worn out, especially plumbing stuff. I am posting the pictures with cracked sink and rusty shower tab. Also, the drain in the shower didn\u2019t work well, and we had to stop water several times during taking shower to allow water in the tab to drain. A plumber who was sent to check the issue told us that it\u2019s as it should be\u2026 So, the only thing I can tell is that this is the worst hotel we\u2019ve ever stayed in this area (we can compare with Iberostar, Sandos Playacar, and Catalonia Tulum which is a bit more to the south \u2013 we stayed in those last years). The five stars shown on the main entrance are some kind of joke \u2013 it can hardly worth 3. But again \u2013 all these problems didn\u2019t prevent us from enjoying this vacation.", "Date": "April 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LA", "Title": "\u201cFABULOUS stay in paradise\u201d", "Author": "goldengirl09", "ReviewID": "UR27413760", "Content": "We spend a great week during Spring Break.

The rooms are good sized. If you've been reading reviews, you have seen that the rooms have an odor. True. Just take along an air freshener. It takes care of the issue. As for the bed size and hardness, they are small and firm. Solution: Ask for an extra single bed. It fits in the room no problem. And also ask for extra matress pads that helps make the beds more comfortable. They were more than happy to accomodate. This resort is the perfect size. We went to the other properties and found them crowded and congested, especially the Riu Tequila. The Playacar is smaller and friendlier with great beach access and staff that will work hard to make your stay pleasurable. The food is very good with a large variety. Do the buffets get old after awhile? Yes, but you can get creative with many of the offerings. It actually was fun trying different combinations of the wide variety. I strongly urge you to try the free Scuba lesson. Its a blast and much easier than you might think. Had I known earlier in the trip, I would have pursued certification while at the resort. Day trips: If the waves are high and rough, stay away from Deep Sea Fishing. A few in our party were very sea sick. I recommend the Mayan Adventure. See Oliver in the lobby. That is one fun trip!

It was our spring break and we had 15 friends at the Riu Yucatan. We loved the Playacar: our trip had its ups and downs, but the hotel was wonderful and we had so much fun there. Like anywhere, there were hiccups here and there, absolutely nothing unmanageable or in the way though. Rooms: There were four of us staying in one room and we never felt too cramped (except I felt bad for the maid because every day we somehow managed to make it seem as if a tornado came through our room before she came in and saved the day). It was two double beds pushed together and without having to ask, they brought in a cot. The beds were a little hard, not as bad as I expected from reading previous reviews, and the bathroom was a good size. The only issue was the smell from the drains after we showered or ran a lot of water. It was pretty gross\u2026 someone came up and poured something down all the drains and it helped a little for the first day. Whenever we walked by the Riu Palace, that same smell was overwhelming there. However, our friends at the Riu Yucatan said they did not have a smell in their room. The building was very pleasant, with the little courtyards and greenery. Also, we were on the third floor\u2014no elevators, but for how much we ate that was probably a good thing. We saw some ants and we all got a few bug bites (our friend at the Yucatan got her legs covered in bites, so we felt lucky for our few). Remember, don\u2019t close the outer door leading to your room and the one next door\u2014you will have to get someone to come up and unlock it. That happened multiple times to us. Food: It was good, but not gourmet. It was what I expected for an all-inclusive place. My only complaint is that they didn\u2019t have bagels for breakfast\u2014they certainly had everything else. I loved their cheese selection and the fruit juices in the morning. Lunch was probably my least favorite of the buffets, it had the least variety. The guacamole?? We ate our weight in it. We ate at all three restaurants\u2014the Mexican was probably my least favorite, but I just didn\u2019t like the kind of steak I got at it, the appetizers were good. The steak at the steak house wasn\u2019t amazing, yet I still ate two. We never felt any need to go into town and eat, we were perfectly content with the food at the resort. I was surprised how good the fruit was and our friend\u2019s mom could not stop raving about the rice pudding. Drinks: I am under 21, so I\u2019m not about to be picky when a drink is set in front of me. They weren\u2019t strong and we preferred the margaritas our friend\u2019s mom made, but we could have tequila boom booms all night long! The pool bar closes pretty early, which sucked because that felt like the place where the teens could really chill and not be in the way. We all liked drinking at our hotel more than the Yucatan because it didn\u2019t feel like we were disturbing the peace quite as much. The beer was meh, I didn\u2019t try the wine, the strawberry margaritas are muy bien, and I think I have had enough tequila to last me quite a while. And to the reviewer before me\u2014I apologize, the spring breakers at the bar was probably us. Beach: All of us agreed that Playacar has the best beach. We walked along the beach every day\u2014if you go far enough past the hotels, you reach a beautiful stretch of open beach that is wonderful. Yes, there are the sandbag things, but they were least in the way at Playacar and fun to climb and jump off of. Kayaking was fun, I wish I had tried jet skiing and wind surfing as well. There was always a beach volleyball game going and everyone was happy to let another join. It was difficult to get a lounge chair on the beach between 9 and 2, so we had to resort to the pool sometimes. The shady spots were great and there were always plenty of sunny spots. Pool: I never went into the pool, but I laid by it several times and hung out by the pool bar frequently. In the afternoons a volleyball net would get set up and people would play water volleyball. It is two medium size pools with a narrow connection between them\u2014one is the active, fun, louder pool and the other is quieter and laid back. There are shady spots with lounge chairs, and I never had a problem finding a place to sit. Entertainment: I did not sit down and watch any of the night shows, but while I was at the bar or hanging out with people in the area I would watch from a distance. They were fun, mainly dancing to popular films and such, and there was a lot of energy. I also didn\u2019t participate in any of the day time activities, even though I meant to do the shooting one. It seemed like if it wasn\u2019t at the pool or they didn\u2019t advertise it, not many people showed up to it. The entertainment crew looked like fun and I kind of regret having not participated in anything or getting to know them. The People: It\u2019s spring break, so naturally there was a young crowd. I really liked our crowd of people\u2014adults and teens\u2014more than those at the Yucatan because people got to know each other and everyone talked and mingled, while at the other place it was an older, more reclusive crowd (even if it was more crowded). I never felt like our hotel was crowded or empty, it felt like the perfect amount of people. I was also a little surprised how many Europeans there were. I really liked that it was a smaller resort, I believe that had an impact on everyone\u2019s nice attitude. Town: If you walk, it\u2019s about 15 or so minutes and don\u2019t miss out on the ruins to your right when you walk there. Our group walked around town for over three hours and we still didn\u2019t feel like we hit half of town\u2014it was a little overwhelming. There are some beautifully decorated restaurants and the nightlife doesn\u2019t come alive until after midnight, but don\u2019t miss out on the clubs (especially Coco Maya and Blue Parrot, located right on the beach. Coco Bongo has a $50 cover charge, it didn\u2019t really seem worth it). A taxi ride is $5 and the cab drivers are lots of fun\u2014we got on great with all of them and they have fun music in the car to listen to. Town isn\u2019t as cheap as I thought it would be, even with haggling. Grounds: Even though Playacar is a smaller resort, it is absolutely beautiful. Not quite the jungle-like feel like the Yucatan (they have monkeys there, which I\u2019m terrified of monkeys so I didn\u2019t mind we didn\u2019t have wildlife to that extent), but very well-kept, green, and so pleasant to look at. There\u2019s lots of color, yet it isn\u2019t loud, and I enjoyed every moment walking around the resort and seeing the grounds. Staff: Between locking ourselves out of the room (once to the point where the silver latch on the other end somehow locked), blowing out our electricity because we had too many blow dryers going, breaking red bands (don\u2019t lose it! $100), and everything else, they were just so wonderful and willing to help. Thank you to all the staff members who put up with us and were so happy to do whatever they could to make our stay great. Safety: With everything going on in Mexico right now, we were a little worried about safety coming to visit, despite it being Playa del Carmen. We went to town with a group of people and no one ever had a problem, four of us girls walked around (never straying more than 10 minutes from out hotel) at night with no problems, nothing was stolen, and although we did our best to keep valuables in the safe, every now and then we would either leave the key to the safe in the room or leave out an iPod or phone or passport or keep it open\u2026 we never felt a hint of discomfort in our safety. Police patrol the beach on a regular basis as well. I would definitely go back to Playacar\u2014it was so much fun and a great place for our group to stay, relax, and enjoy ourselves.", "Date": "March 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "erie, pa", "Title": "\u201cNot for Adults Only\u201d", "Author": "lpecni", "ReviewID": "UR26498156", "Content": "We just got back from staying at the Riu Playacar for four nights: Accomodations: Room was good, maid service excellent, balcony had a spectacular view.

Stayed in Riu Playacar for 4 nights. We all had the time of our lives! We were looking for the best deal we could get since we were in a very tight budget, and we were very satisfied with this hotel. Yes, there is a little of everything that other reviews mentioned: the beds are hard, a few mosquitoes, the food wasn't gourmet but good, the drinks were weak, but these things were totally manageable. The staff was very friendly and always willing to please us and accommodate us. The grounds are kept immaculate, and the rooms are very clean. The buffet had variety, good for all tastes. One night we dined (previous reservation) at the Mexican Restaurant, and we found the Buffet better and more fun. The night shows are impressive (don't forget you're not in Broadway), and night life for our daughters was just right. The routine at night for them was having drinks at the bar (Enrique, the bartender was sooo sweet and fun!) during the show ending at around 11 pm, going across the street to sister hotel Riu Tequila that is included , the bar and disco are open until 2:00, and if you wanted to keep partying, you could get a taxi to 5th Ave. for $5 (5 minutes away) and continue at the Blue Parrot. Location is perfect since you are very close to 5th Ave (20 min. walk or 5 min. ride), but is quiet and private for the beaches. The hotel is good for a family, as well as for couples, or like us for parents with young adults. We noticed a few groups of all women. There's always something for everyone while is fun and safe. I would recommend this hotel to anybody! You get great value, great service, and great location -nothing luxurious but pretty. If you are expecting luxury, go next door to the Riu Palace. Tips: watch your hotel towels at the pool! Our first day at the pool, my daughter's towel disappeared and found out that the hotel charges you $25 if you don't return your towel. Fortunately they didn't. If you are arranging for a private transportation from airport to hotel, do it one way in Cancun-express ($75), you can't take a taxi at the airport! You can return to the airport with a taxi from the hotel for $50. Have pesos to pay for a taxi, if you use it enough times you can save some money. They charge you 50 pesos or $5. The rate when I went was $1= 14.5 pesos. Taxi to the airport 600 pesos or $50. You do the math. If you like ceramic, go to 5th ave, (10th st & 5th) second store from the corner going north, doesn't have a name (the name is \"Los Espejos de Paola\" but is not posted). Sebastian has the best ceramic from Puebla, \"talavera\" dishes, great variety, great quality, and very reasonable prices.", "Date": "March 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cYou Get What You Pay For ... And Don't Get What You Don't Pay For\u201d", "Author": "babspeapod", "ReviewID": "UR26128920", "Content": "How we selected this place: My BF and I were on a budget and wanted to find something <$900/person, all inclusive with RT airfare from Philadelphia. Obviously, most places were easy to rule out based on price. Also, he doesn't like huge high-rise hotels -- the Riu Playacar has a smaller, manageable feel to it. I have mixed feelings about this place -- and I've travelled all over the world both luxury and budget. The grounds, the beach and the pool area are beautiful and impeccably clean. Once you get into the room and are looking for comfort and pampering ... well, things start to slip. Here are 10 observations and tips -- the good, the bad, the ugly. 1.) Beds/Pillows: The beds get an \"F\" for comfort. They're hard as rocks and the pillows are about 2\" thick. We had a \"king\" room, but it was 2 full-sized beds pushed together. Horribly uncomfortable. To quote my BF \"I can't imagine why anyone would buy a bed like that. It's as hard as the ground.\" Bring your own pillow if you're picky about where you rest your head. 2.) Bugs -- Before we went, I read mixed reviews about bugs rumored in the rooms. More of the reviews seemed to debunk the myth, so I booked our room but was on the lookout from Day One. (We brought no food into the room.) I saw a few ants and mosquitos, but nothing else .... until the last night. Then, a roach crawled out from under the bed. I freaked, only to find out my BF had been spotting them and killing them all along -- mainly near the bathroom and the mini-fridge. If I'd have known this, we'd have been outta there. The mosquito thing -- bring bug spray for the shows at night if you're prone to attack. I got over 30 bites on my legs in less than an hour during a show one night, and had to get medication. 3.) Other aspects of the rooms - Nicely appointed with TVs (mix of English, Spanish, and other language channels), balconies, liquor dispensers and mini fridges. Stand-up shower had great water pressure. Ask ahead of time for more towels and more bottled water. 4.) Bathroom products -- They do not supply hair conditioner or body lotion, and it's very expensive in the gift shop and stores. Bring your own. I called the front desk to request this stuff, and they informed me they don't have it. They give bath \"gel\", a shower cap, hand soap and shampoo. The room also has a blow dryer and an iron. 5.) Hotel Services -- There's no disco, no fitness center, no jacuzzi, no business center, and no spa as some of the web/print material suggests. You have to go to another resort (which is NOT just an easy walk next door). If having these things conveniently accessible is important to you, I recommend you either pick another place or mentally prepare to have to go out of your way for these hotel services. 6.) Food - Both of us thought the food was excellent. There's something for everyone, and we also enjoyed a nice dinner at the steakhouse. I generally hate buffets, but will admit that I thought some of the buffet food was excellent -- even delicious. The carrot cake was to die for. 7.) Nightlife - Once dinner is over, there is a nightly show at 9:45pm. If you want to do anything other than go to a show after dinner, you'll have to leave the resort. Now, that's not a bad thing. It costs 50pesos for a taxi to 5th Avenue, which has many blocks of bars, restaurants, shops, etc. If you want a resort with a party atmosphere, you've picked the wrong spot. This resort is good for families, older couples, or people who are looking for low-key. 8.) Service - Front desk was fast w/check in/out. Pool bar service was fast but not too friendly (especially considering we were tipping quite generously); Restaurant service was great; Bell stand gets a taxi in <5 mins (BTW, tipping is not customary or required .... we just happen to be tippers.) 9.) Theft - We had no issues with theft (which concerned me based on previous reviews of places in mexico). We used the in-room safe and had no problems. I also took my very nice camera to the pool during the day and had no problems. 10.) Drinks - Alcoholic drinks were not good. You can serve yourself to Dos Equis on tap or 3 kinds of wine (red, white, rose) from barrels. Other than that, all of the drinks are very weak and sugary. Not good at all. Would I go back? Maybe, but probably not. I think I'd be willing to pay more for better quality and more services. But it I needed a vacation on a budget again .... I'd consider coming here again. I'd recommend it, but with some disclaimers and tips for preparation.", "Date": "March 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, WI", "Title": "\u201cOkay stay at Riu Playacar\u201d", "Author": "WarmItUp", "ReviewID": "UR26069232", "Content": "Stayed at Riu Playacar March 3-6 then moved to Riu Palace Riviera Maya for 7-10. Knew upon booking Playacar from reading reviews that rooms were not updated but we were hoping would be better. Stayed with husband and 2 kids so room seemed quite cramped for 4 and beds were small-not queens but doubles, not enough drawer space, sink faucet was drippy. We were in building 6 (pink building) and it was indeed loud at night until after 11PM from the show. Overall the grounds were beautiful and pools/restaurants were pretty nice, nothing fantastic but not bad. Our favorite was the Mexican restaurant - can book each morning at breakfast time, Asian food was good, but another buffet but at least in smaller restaurant atmosphere. Standard buffets were okay-I never went hungry by any means but wasn't excited about food either. Never used the kids club because no one was there the few times I wandered over and was never informed of schedule. We visited the Riu Yucatan and Riu Tequila and enjoyed spending time at the Tequila pool during the day both an easy walk, within 2 blocks. Nice shops directly across the street and Playa del Carmen was indeed close by, took the $5 taxi ride their and walked back which took maybe 20 minutes. We accidently wandered onto the Riu Palace Mexico grounds looking for the Yucatan and were so impressed I went to inquire at the desk if we could move over, they directed me to inquire with our travel agency. We had asked upon check-in at the Playacar if any available suites and told no, but upon mentioning concern about our room to the on-site Funjet rep, he spoke with desk staff and since they were overbooked later in the week they offered us opportunity to move to Riu Palace Riviera Maya in a few days-we gratefully accepted! We loved the Palace, much nicer rooms, nicer grounds, better drinks-smart marketing move on their part because we could not be satisified with Playacar level in future now that we've stayed at a Palace. So beware, don't visit one of the Palaces if you don't want to be dissapointed in Playacar. Playacar was about 1 hour drive from Airport. We went on the Alltournatives Maya Encounter tour to Coba, ziplining and rappelling into a cenote. The kids (ages 6 & 9) said ziplining was their favorite part of the trip-rappelling into cenote was trickest part and you'd have to know if your kids are adventurous enough to handle it. Be aware that they didn't serve lunch until after 2:30 so eat a large breakfast and take a snack with for after Coba visit. My other tip is if you have kids don't forget to pack Children's Tylenol or Motrin-my son got a fever and I had to search mulitiple stores for an equivalent and then couldn't read Spanish and doses were based on weight in kg so was confusing.", "Date": "March 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed the stay\u201d", "Author": "BACKTOREALITYUsa", "ReviewID": "UR26056794", "Content": "This was my 1st time to a RIU resort.

The rooms are not that fancy but we were only there to take a shower & sleep. I did notice mosquito's in some locations but was not bitten one time. There were two pools, one for the roudier crowd & one if you prefer to sit back & relax which I enjoyed. We had trouble finding chairs on the beach day 1 but after that no trouble at all. There is a wonderful breeze off the ocean so be careful. You may feel like your not getting hot but I can guarentee you'll leave red (ha). The ocean water was getting warmer & warmer each day that we were there - not too bad. This was definitely worth the 3 1/2 star rating it receives. I normally stay at 5 star but was pleased with this hotel. The landscaping is beautfil & I definitely recommend walking down to the sister hotel RIU Yucatan. It was very nice. There are shops directly across the street & we also took a $5(US) cab ride to 5th avenue to do more shopping. We actually went there 2 days out of our 7 night stay & still didn't hit all the shops.

There was a huge selection but it was the same every night. It wasn't gourmet tasty but it was edible. The grounds were well manicured, clean, and pretty. The beach was nice and was one of the larger ones in the area. Only saw two shows but they were pretty good. We enjoyed our stay. We booked our trip through Worry-Free Travel and was very impressed with that as well. Our only really negative experience was with the Worry-Free Rep at the hotel \"Oliver\". He was really helpful at first but once we had purchased our excursions through him (he gets commission on these) he was no longer very helpful. In fact he really copped an attitude when we requested our money back on a fishing excursion that was not going out due to rough waters.

You only get two one liters of water in your fridge for every two days...so stalk up when you see the cart down the hall..as we learned on the last two days of our trip. The room was great, all you would expect for being at the carribean sea..who stays in their room anyhow,, they were very clean. The alcohol dispensers were ok, I didn't really care for any of the booze in my room, but my friends next door had different brands that were much, much,, much,, better!! The Night life is great, the shows are mezmorizing.. we just loved it so much. We went to all of the 3 hotels and the service at all were fantastic! Your beach is beautiful, one of the best on the strip. Our travel agent told us to purchase our excursions thru her, and we couldn't find her so we went to the people right beside the front desk, and it was definately worth it. It was cheaper to buy through them (approx 13$ american), we went to the guy right beside the path to the rooms. The buses were clean and safe. The driver and the other guy explained everything and were very helpful. There was no need to feel leary about using these guys. We went to playa del carmen a couple times, didn't find that the shopping was very cheap, but it was a great time. We went to Senor Frogs and had a wild time!! The service there was far beyond what we expected! The food was good, a bit repetitive, but good enough! All the hotels have the same selection, which kinda made us sad because we thought we would get something else but no such luck. They were all the same. Bring some good shoes if you plan on walking around lots, my first time here, and I didn't realize how much your feet swell... needless to say, I wasn't wearing my dancing shoes around the clock! My date is a light sleeper, so this hotel was great. It wasn't the party scene, but it was only a short walk to the party if that is what you are looking for. The traffic was light into the night. Oh Yeah, one more thing,, the calling cards we bought from Walmart in Canada didn't work in Mexico,, so if you have little ones at home that you need to call, make sure to get the proper calling card, as the hotel charges an arm and a leg,, as well as,, 2$ per each time you use the phone to call with a calling card!

As the title says, this was our third trip to this resort. This time, however, was for our wedding. That in itself should suggest what we think of the Riu Playacar and its staff. Here's the low down on what to expect. Rooms: Are spacious enough for what they're being used for. They are cleaned daily and the bar fridge is serviced every second day. If you need something for the fridge on the non-serviced day then simply call the front desk and ask them nicely to send you up whatever you need. And of course please remember to tip the person for their service...that goes for the chamber maid as well. Food: There are three a la carte restaurants and a buffet. But don't cringe at the thought of buffet food for a week. There is a massive selection of really good food here.....for both the meat-eater and the vegetarian. Try the banana milk at the morning buffet, so good. The breakfast and dinner buffets are served at the main buffet off of the main lobby. The lunch buffet is served at the Turquesa restaurant which is located beside the beach and pool. On occasion they serve a barbeque meal at or near the pool as well. Service & Staff: Incredible! Each person that we have interacted with over the course of our three visits has been wonderful. Special thanks to Management - Helena and Sebastian; Front Desk - Claudia, Aldo, Jorge, Gilberto and Juan Carlos; Chamber Maid - Maria; Bar Servers - Osvaldo, Benjamin and the rest of that crazy crowd; and of course all the fabulous folks working their collective behinds off to ensure people have a great stay. Beach & Pool: Despite the beach decay that has been taking place for the past little while, and the sand bags placed in the ocean to help slow that decay, the beach is a wonderful place to relax, tan, swim and enjoy the sounds of the water. For those who prefer having a few beverages throughout the day, while soaking themselves, then the pool bar is a great alternative. Be forewarned however that when you least expect it you may receive a spray of water from the liquid dispenser behind the bar....courtesy of one of the bartenders of course. Activities & Entertainment: There are plenty of activities available on the resort. The Entertainment Team have a variety of games etc that they do each day with folks at the resort....such as: Air Rifle Shooting, Darts, Ping Pong, Water Polo, Water Aerobics, Bingo, Dance Lessons etc etc. Lots of fun and very interactive team. Down at the beach you have access to a variety of water-related activities. In the evening the resort puts on a stage show. Each night is different. If you're only going to see one, however, do yourself a favour and go see the Mayan Show. If you happen to enjoy watching dancers than you'll want to see some of the other shows as well. Tours & Other off resort happenings: There are plenty of half and full day excursions available if you want to see things off the resort. The trip to Xcaret Park is worthwhile. They have a show in the evening that'll blow your socks off. The Tulum Ruins are also a fairly short distance from the resort. You have a few choices when it comes to travelling to any of these places. You can get an authentic Mexican experience by taking the Collectivo van to your destination (this is the way many locals travel - A trip to Tulum Pueblo (town) cost us approximately $2 each - 1/2 hour to 40 minute drive). A private van can be arranged through the front desk (round trip to the Tulum ruins costs $120. The driver waits for you for whatever timeframe you've pre-arranged....you also don't pay until he/she drops you back at the resort). BTW, the entrance fee to the ruins is $5. If you'd prefer to have an arranged or guided tour then talk to the folks from the various tour companies located in the lobby. If you're into shopping then you can either walk 30 minutes or a 5 minute $5 taxi ride down to 5th Avenue with several blocks of restaurants, shopping and night clubs. It's definitely a tourist trap area but it is worth going down. You'll find some good deals and you'll also be able to haggle. Everyone stands outside their stores and asks you to come in. Some are more creative than others in what they say to bring you in....like one guy who uses the line \"we have the best and rip you off for less\" Bonus: When you stay at the Playacar you have access to three of the other resorts in the Riu complex: Lupita (with the golf course, fees apply for golf), Tequila (across the street...this resort has the disco), and the Yucatan. Conclusion: This resort and its staff are wonderful and we highly recommend it. We cant wait to go for the 4th trip!

I suppose if the weather that week wasn't on the cooler side, I would have enjoed the cool dip. I think there were just enough chairs for everyone who wanted to be there. At least they couldn't fit anymore around the deck, Lots of trees and huts for shade. Swim up bar, with extra table and chairs on deck for drinks and a game of cards. The beach has grown since the sand whales went in. So there's lots of room on the sand, and in the tree line for chairs. We were on the beach at around 9 or so, and were usually the first few there. I only found towel savers there once, maybe twice. But then again, the weather was cooler that week, so maybe there wasn't a mad dash for the beach. It was red flagged every single day, one yellow flag one morning. The waves were fun, but the lifequard was always making sure you weren't much past your waist. We fed the fish right off shore some bread, and the kids had fun being swarmed by these white silvery little fish- otherwise we never saw them. Pelicans were always around, diving in the ocean here and there, on the other side of the sand whales, catching their meals. The beach snack bar had good food, hamburgs, fries, hot dogs, a variety of pizza, ice cream with sprinkles, fruit, cold cuts and cheeses, salads, desserts, a nacho table with dips and chips, and melted cheese etc, popcorn, cooked veges, chicken and pork, pop, beer, ice, coffee and cappacino machine. The main buffet also had the above, for breakfast, well anything and everything. Yogurts, cereals, eggs, pancakes- sometimes with chocolate inside, sugary donuts, buns with chocolate inside, juices, bacon, sausage, ......MG isn't no wonder I alone gained 6 lbs. The entertainment at night was okay, a good mexican show, and mariachia show was good. And you could go to the other non Palace Riu to have breaky, lunch or do the shows there, so there's plenty of variety - if nothing else but just to do the same at another resort. They also had airgun, darts, volleyball, tennis (nice new rackets), water fitness, beach games to get you off your butts for a few minutes. I never found the staff to be pushy or overaggressive to get you to join in. Or the music too loud. The odd time someone would come around at the beach to sell silver chains, or parasailing $50/pers on etc, but even a no nod was enough. Oh - massage on the beach too - $59/hour. We took a cab to 5th ave. $5us each way. Or you can walk. Lots of tourist doing that, or bike riding. 25 mins or so they say to walk it. Good shopping for souvieners, Mcdonalds was on at least 2 corners. Places for a drink or twooooo. Ferries to cozumel. Little Cathlic Church. Beach for swimming. Glad we went. Across the little street at the Riu, there is also a little shopping mall. Internet is a little cheaper there, $3/half hour. $8/hour at the Riu. It's in behind the plaza at the Kodac shop - (I think that's what is was called - you'll find it easy) Couldn't complain about anything except the weather and the red flags. But what can yea do. I loved Mexico, and all the staff seemed geniunely happy to serve or help you. whistling while they worked. And could speak perfect english. It's funny to watch them wait for you to speak so they know what language to reply in. I did have the foresight to ask the tour operator to make sure we were on the \"new\" resort pick up list for the return home. Good thing I asked, because the Riu didn't tell them we had been upgraded to a different hotel-----altho a longer stay would have be excepted :)", "Date": "February 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "PA", "Title": "\u201cService - Great, Rooms - Not So Great!\u201d", "Author": "yrhgrb", "ReviewID": "UR24745288", "Content": "The hotel common areas (pool, dining areas, etc.) were clean and very nice.

The food was very good. You have your choice of three \"full service\" dining specialities (Steak, Asian or Mexican) or the buffet for dinner. If you don't like your chosen full service dinner choice, you can always go to the buffet after. You do not have to dress up as stated on the web site. You will not be out of place with shorts on. If you want to use the gym or spa, you must go to one of the \"sister\" Riu hotels down the street. The hotel is just under 2 miles to downtown Playa Del Carmen and was a great walk through a nice neighborhood. The room had a musty smell to it. If you don't get a suite, you don't get a tub (just a small shower with no light fixture). The beds are hard. We had a standard room and there were 2 double beds pushed together to make a king bed (but they are separate beds). The suites have a queen size bed and larger balconies - same musty smell though). There are 2 small wicker chairs and a small table in the room but not very comfortable. We stayed in one of the buildings closest to the pool and entertainment area. We heard the microphone and music in the room during the day and every night at 930pm, they have live entertainment that runs until 11pm. it is very difficult to sleep while the entertainment is on stage. We went with a larger group and everyone had a nice time. We spent most of our time by the pool or doing other activites because we weren't fond of hanging out in the musty room.

We are seasoned travelers to the Mayan Riviera, one of our favorite vacation areas. Check in took about 15 minutes. During the wait we were greeted with juices and smiles. The staff was very helpful and courteous. Our initial room was on the ground floor level. It was very musky and smelly and we soon were moved up to a second floor room which was ideal. Rooms aren't as swanky as some of the newer resorts but they are comfortable and pretty spacious. Each room features a bar with four hard liquors and a daily replenishment of beer, water and soft drinks. The balcony is a nice place to sit and relax with a snack after a day in the hot sun. We had lots of fun feeding the birds from there. Walk to our room was quick as Riu Playacar is one of the smaller resorts in the area. The complex consists of six three story buildings so wherever you end up staying it's just steps from the beach, pools or restaurants. It's very convenient. The grounds are green and lush, filled with flowers and trees. Another perk is the small shopping plaza across the street from the resort. Whether you want to grab some Starbucks, buy last minute gifts or get medicine, the mall is open until about 11pm daily and is a nice post-dinner activity. If you feel more adventurous, walk (about 20 minutes) or take a 50 peso / $4 cab ride to the center of Playa del Carmen for more shopping, dining and nightlife. The main swimming pool was big, clean and consisted of two smaller pools. The water was refreshing but not too cold. The swim-up bar was popular with rowdier crowds who enjoyed drinking, dancing and smoking in the pool. The lounge chairs filled up pretty quickly around the pools but since we like to sleep in and prefer the beach anyway, we had no problems with finding chairs by the sea around noon. Even though the beaches in the area have noticeable eroded over the last year, the Riu Playacar beach was one of the nicer ones in the area. Ever since a drowning accident at the beginning of the year, the Riu lifeguards were particularly attentive since the waves were high and easily pulled the swimmers in. There are three bars at the resort: at the lobby, by the pools and by one of the restaurants close to the beach. The drinks are mediocre but if you ask for the top shelf liquors, they can be much better. Even though this is an all-inclusive, the bartenders and staff really appreciates tips. We brought $100 in singles and tipped all over the resort. Food was one of the best highlight of the entire experience. Whether breakfast, lunch or dinner, everything was fresh and there was [plenty to choose from. The cooks and servers made sure that all items were quickly replenished. There are three restaurants at the resort but we actually enjoyed dinners at the buffet much better. The steakhouse restaurant was good, the Asian one was forgettable and we never made it to the Mexican one. If you choose to dine at one of them, unlike at some other resorts there is no drama with getting a reservation. You simply ask one of the servers at breakfast. Over all our week-long stay at Riu Playacar was a great one. It's nice to stay at a smaller resort for a change. We didn't have to worry about anything. If we ran out of drinking water in our room, room-service was at our door within minutes. At nights the grounds were calm and quiet.

The booking was done through Sunquest. What a great choice they made. We were met by Sunquest personal in Cancun for our bus ride to Playa del Carmen. One word of warning - be careful of the people who bombard you at the airport with an offer to carry your luggage as they're scam artists with the goal of lightening your wallet. There were reports of charges up to $70 US for carrying your baggage only a short distance. The bus ride was air conditioned and cold beer was offered at a cost of $3 US (no all inclusive yet!) As well, tipping is expected for the driver and the hosts! Our arrival @ the hotel at about 12:30 pm was basically unorganized and most rooms were not ready. We had a Jr. suite & our room was available. Most of the wedding party were left to wander the resort for the next few hours while rooms were readied. Some guests were assigned rooms but needed to move the next day. The bride & groom did not receive their room upgrade to a Jr. Suite but they were ok with the regular room. We only received one key for the room which presented a bit of a problem when we lost our key. The front desk clerk told us that there wasn't a second key & we were to contact the maid when we needed to get access to our room. Yeah right! We contacted the hospitality manager who told us to get a key from the front desk - told him that they wouldn't help us. Within 2 minutes, we rec'd a call telling us that they had a key for us but it would be $20 US!!!! Hubby went to pick up key, refused to pay & was given 2 keys???????? Lock your valuables in the safe as there doesn't appear to be organization in this area although there were no reports of theft. The front desk clerk was very upset that we had reported this situation and that he had received a notice from his supervisor about poor service. The rooms were clean and well stocked with bar including bottled water, soft drinks, mineral water and beer. There are no kingsized beds but (2) queens made separately & pushed together. It was reported that the beds were hard but we enjoy a very firm bed - others complained about this. The sheets were a bit pilly but we're used to very high grade sheets. I had read reports that the rooms had a musty smell so packed Febreeze - our room was fine but I did notice that other rooms had \"that\" smell so passed along the Febreeze. My daughter & hubby travelled with their 4.5 month old son & requested a crib - the crib was not used as it definitely didn't come up to Canadian standards (spacing of rails was very oversized & we didn't consider safe). The water in the rooms is NOT drinkable although I brushed my teeth with it and NO problems. In fact, I didn't hear any reports of intestinal issues On the EXCELLENT side - the food is excellent & very plentiful, the bar staff will make you anything & ready to suggest new choices, there is always something going on (if you want to do the organized activities), the entertainment staff are encouraging & very friendly, the evening shows are great & the layout of the resort is easy to get around and very attractive. The staff were also more than helpful for any requests regarding the baby. We participated in the morning beach exercise (more of a stretching/ Yoga but wonderful for the travel aches and a great start to the day), beach volleyball and water aerobics. Great way to meet others & wear off some of the extra calories consumed. By the way, the food consumed in Mexico has NO calories!!!! Regarding the food - there are LOTS of fresh fruit, veggies & low fat food choices including grilled fish choices. Dinner choices include the a la carte Mexicano, Steakhouse & Asian choices and the buffet. We tried all & not impressed by the Asian - overly sauced & not a la carte but buffet style. The most favoured choice was the general buffet - lots of excellent choices including seafood and an absolutely wonderful dessert bar (my favourite - sweet potato pie!!!!!) and you don't have to book your seating time - leaves your schedule totally open. Although it is an all inclusive resort, tipping IS expected. We left a tip for the maid on the first day & superior service was given compared to those who didn't tip. Bar/restaurant staff are included in this so make sure to take along smaller US$ bills with you - Canadian $$$ is not appreciated! We travelled by taxi ($5 US each way) into town for some shopping. It is a bit intimidating as the merchants are a bit aggressive. We were advised by our Sunquest rep to go after 6 pm (shops open till 10 pm) and offer 1/2 of the requested price then start bartering. I bought some great silver jewellery pieces but really shopped around before buying. I paid $120 US for a necklace with a pair of earrings thrown in but other shops offered the same piece but for a min $300 US. Liquor is also very cheap - 40 oz Kahlua for $10.60 US and tequila for $13. We also noted that the duty free in Cancun has excellent prices for liquor but not as good as town. The beach is great with sand resembling light brown sugar. The \"bags\" in the water are not the most attractive but didn't cause any problems - actually protected us against the heavy waves experienced. Other resorts had minimal beach access due to the bags. While we were there, the red flag (stay out of the water due to strong waves & undertow) was out 4 days and access to sea kayaks, boogie boards, catamarans, etc was not available. Yes, you can walk forever along the beach front! There is also lots of shade available both on the beach & around the pools - lots of lounge chairs available as well! The wedding was very organized and staff were great! An absolutely beautiful event (I do understand that flowers were quite expensive) Would we go back - most definitely. We didn't have time (due to the wedding to visit any ruins or other sights. We were there for relaxation and definitely got that!

We did have the choice to go to the beautiful Riu Palace chaple, but we risked it and the rain held off!!

There are 3 bldgs on each side. The two closest bldg to the beach (#'s 5 & 6) are too close to the loud music and activites coming from the entertainment shell. Ask for rooms in blds 1,2,3, or 4 if you are going to bed before 10:30. Rooms themselves were just fine. Room safe should be used at all times. Maid service very, very prompt and good.

The Playacar Golf Club across the street from the RIU is $130 twilight rate but if you agree to the 2hr or so timeshare presentation, you can get your golf for 1/2 price all week.

I have not slept more than two hours a night since. I have many issues with this event that I need to share with you before I am able to let this go. There are many \"lifeguards\" sitting on top of towers pretending to know something about life saving in this area. Be warned. THEY DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT LIFESAVING. The \"lifeguard\" swam out to \"rescue\" the man that was struggling in the water without ANY life saving device--even though there are at least four that I could count on the beach. Not surprisingly the rescue was unsucessful in waves as tall as my house with a dimwit with no life ring as the rescuer. There were red flags out that day--danger these flags mean stay out of the water. DANGER DANGER!!! The man that drown was a 73 year old man who should not have been swimming in the big waves and likely got on the wrong side of the sandbags(meant to keep the beach from eroding) I never saw how he got to the wrong side of the sandbags only that he could not get back to the shallow side. Many tourists attempted to help the initial rescuer while his boss from the playacar stood on the beach and watched. (with a little radio in his hand) He never got a backboard...got an airway...got a defibrillator..put towels down to lay the man on when they brought him in from the ocean, (let me guess--they've never seen anyone drown here before...) When we finally did get the man to the beach the Riu staff were useless. The lifeguard wanted to simply turn him on his side and pat his back. The man was lifeless, pulseless not to mention entirely blue. We initiated CPR. It took RIU over ten minutes before we had a venti mask. They NEVER HAD an airway or bagger. They got us a backboard after we had been doing CPR for 15 minutes already. The ambulance arrived after at LEAST 25 minutes. The ambulance driver never assesed the pt at all. She pronounced him dead without ever glancing at him. The management of RIU was more interested with removing the nuisance than with trying to save his life. I am horrified. I feel absolutely ill. I have never felt so helpless and frustrated. I felt there were many things that contributed to the untimely death of this man. 1)Sandbags--many times throughout our stay at PDC we saw people stranded on the \"wrong\" side of the sandbags--I'll bet there has been an increase in deaths from drowning in the area since the placement of the sandbags--we will likely never know as these things are not publicized. 2) Rescuer without any rescue aid and from my vantage point no rescue knowledge--I was shocked to realize that the RIU employee initially assisting me with this man had seemingly no knowledge of CPR. Three other nurses and a doctor and a firefighter (all tourists) attempted to resusitate this man for 25 minutes. 3)No equipment to aid in his rescue: no airways,ambubag, backboard or an AED--it is 2009 people!!! 4)THE DOCTOR FROM THE PLAYACAR NEVER ARRIVED ON SCENE--NOT EVER!!!!!!! 5)The ambulance took aver 25 minutes to arrive and even then carried faulty equipment and untrained ambulance attendants. I still feel awful for leaving this man's wife in the hands of that cold heartless ambulance attendant and the guy with the radio from RIU. I can only pray for her and her family.

We thought it would be a problem but we were all so tired that we fell asleep and it didn't bother us - usually over by midnight. I will say the shows didn't start until almost 10pm each night which got a bit late for the kids. That said, don't miss the 8:30pm mini disco - adorable! my favorite part of the trip. Food - excellent. (We have stayed at 4 all-inclusives in the Caribbean). Lots of selection - yes, a few of the same things every night but sometimes it's nice to have just pasta, salad...We tried the Mexican rest. one night - wouldn't do it again. Main dining just as good. Kids definitely didn't like it. fun to have nachos, popcorn available for snacks. The girls loved the smoothies and the bar staff was very kind to them. Beach - decent size, sort of crowded but what we expected considering there are about 15 resorts right there. I loved walking on the beach each day and if you are a runner - definitely hold off until 4-5 pm and run along the beach - another highlight of the trip. The caribbean was warmer than the pools (unheated but the kids swam in them) and bring some rolls to feed the fish - really fun! The fish swim around you and nibble at your fingers - the girls thought that was awesome! Don't swim out past or play on the sand bags....not smart.

Rooms - Hard to complain when we got upgraded but I would agree with prior comments about hard beds and a bad odor. That said, we were hardly ever in the rooms awake and I slept great every night. My parents (in their 70s) also slept fine. We requested cots for the girls as the \"double\" beds are really a just a bit bigger than singles. They slept fine, too. We locked our valuables but never had any problems. we left a tip ($3-5) each day and the staff made cute towel animals. The rooms are very clean as is the whole resort. Anyone who complains needs to lighten up a bit. Animation staff - Adolfo , Carlo and the rest were great. Always tried to get you to join in but weren't too pushy. They were always smiling and definitely got to know who we were. My husband wanted a CD of the music they played each night at the mini disco and they happily made a copy. Other stuff...Although expensive ($150pp) I recommend the 1 hour swim w/ the Dolphins through Dolphinus. The girls did it but my husband and I just watched and we wished we did it. An amazing experience. You are with 4 other people in the water w/ the dolphins for 1 hr...kissing, hugging, foot push ride. Only 15 minute ride from the Riu. The girls painted pottery at the beach. Again, I wish I did it - they touch it up for you (if you want) and then glaze/fire it...ready the next day. Wish I could remember the name of the Expedia guy in the lobby - he was awesome. AA lost my husband's luggage for 24 hrs and he was a big help. Also booked the Dolphin trip and return transfer. We would definitely return to this area as it's nice to shop across the street as well as WALK into town (took 20 minutes and very safe). We didn't use any of the other Riu's but you do have access to 3 others.", "Date": "January 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cRIU Playacar somewhat seasoned traveler review\u201d", "Author": "sleslie31", "ReviewID": "UR23902141", "Content": "We just got back from a stay at the RIU PLayacar in Mexico. Let me start by saying that we are pretty seasoned travelers. We\u2019ve stayed at all classes of hotels. From roach-fest\u2019s to the Four Seasons in Kona, HI. I\u2019ll share with you my thoughts for those planning on going there. The Good: This place is small. With that said, the staff really takes the time to get to know you. I didn\u2019t feel like an occupant. I felt like a guest & they were happy we were there. Check-in & transfers were a breeze & well organized. The front desk people were very nice- Especially the girl with reddish hair (didn\u2019t get her name). I think she is from Holland. This is not a place for someone snooty or someone pretending to be high class. It is laid back and everyone there \u2013 guests included - wanted to relax, be a little silly & have fun. Dining: The dining staff were great. If you sit in the same area for your meals, the waiters will remember your drinks and remember your name. They work tirelessly and hop on things right away. They paid individual attention to the kids that came through, making them feel special and welcome. The food was superb. Remember that you are at an all-inclusive environment. Some reviews said the food was the same all week. Not true. There is a different food theme every night. Then on top of that, they provide alternates that are the same. Like your basic pizza, pasta, burgers, salad. There was always something new to eat if you wanted to try it. The dining room is indoors and beautifully decorated & clean. I can say out of the 5 all-inclusive resorts we\u2019ve done, the food was by far the best here. I will note though that it is a little dressier than other AI resorts we\u2019ve been to. They enforce the \u2018no muscle shirts\u2019, etc at night. As for the specialty restaurants, we only did the Japanese. It was good, but if I had to do it over again, the main dining room was just as good. Pool: There are 2 pools. One is quieter and one has activities & the bar. There were plenty of palapa\u2019s if you wanted shade. There were plenty of chairs & towels. The bar staff were great. Even when kids came up over & over for frozen smoothies, they made them just as friendly. Beach: Wonderful beach. By other reviews I thought it was going to be small and crowded. It was actually quite large. There are sand whales there, but that\u2019s the same at all of the resorts. Please be careful to not swim past the sand whales. Even if you are one of those impervious men who think you \u2018can handle it.\u2019 The waves that crash you into the sand whales can, and have proven to be deadly very recently. On the lighter side; Lots of topless for the men. My husband was happy (Yes, American) If you have smaller kids, you may want to have a talk before the trip. My kids are about as embarrassing as they come & they were fine with it. We always just remind them that people do different things all over the world. Animation Staff: Excellent. They get to know you & your name. They work probably work 14 hours each day and NEVER run out of smiles. They get you involved and participating in games & activities. However they don\u2019t cross the line like I\u2019ve seen some animation teams do. If you are a loner, they will respect that too. To me the entertainment staff makes a big factor in the visit & these men/women were great & great with the kids too. There were a lot of kids there to my surprise (for January). Before we got there my kids said they were too old for the kids club, but they ended up loving it & begging to go. I don\u2019t think a REALLY little kid would benefit from it. There isn\u2019t a nursery like some places. But anyone between 3-10 will like it a lot. The Bad: The only thing I can really think of that stunk were the beds. Yes they are hard and the pillows are flat. But, we were so tired at the end of each day we didn\u2019t have a problem. I think all Caribbean resorts must get the same beds from somewhere because they were bad in the Dominican Republic & the Bahamas too. The rooms are just fine. Not fancy by any means, but fine to live in for a week Now when I say that, I am comparing them to the Four Seasons, Kona & some of our less-than-adequate hotels in the past. The rooms here are very clean. Yes I did smell the sewage people talked about one day. But it was just about an hour & my husband didn\u2019t even smell it. There also was that musty smell. But I have found that is the case in all Caribbean countries I\u2019ve been to. It is such a warm & moist environment. I don\u2019t think it can be escaped. After the initial smelling of it when we first got there, I didn\u2019t notice it the rest of the time. In all this place is a great value for the money. My older son actually had tears in his eyes when we left. They said it was the best place ever. EVEN better than the Four Seasons, Kona. And it\u2019s not $1000 a night! My suggestions: Use the Collectivo\u2019s. If you aren\u2019t familiar with them, read up on the internet. It\u2019ll save you tons of money on travel expenses. From Playacar, you\u2019ll need to take a taxi to the hwy. & that\u2019s only a few dollars. Watch out in Playa Del Carmen. Everyone wants to make a buck & that\u2019s how the bacon is brought home. Even Burger King ripped off my husband, charging him $6 for 2 medium cokes. His fault \uf04a There are no prices on the board & they guy said \u201cI charge you what I want.\u201d Wal-Mart isn\u2019t worth the trip. I thought there\u2019d be great tourist stuff deals, but not. Even the suntan lotion isn\u2019t that much cheaper than in town. Don\u2019t swim past the sand whales. IT IS DEADLY. There is shopping across the street, but it isn\u2019t much cheaper than the hotel. Playacar is an affluent area with a lot of money. Go to town for stuff. Bring big cups with you. The drink glasses are cafeteria sized. We forgot ours this trip and hated it. Relax & don\u2019t have unachievable expectations. Your vacation is what YOU make of it.

We were very pleased with the RIU Playacar. We had access to all the other RIU hotels except for the RIU Palace. We've stayed in several all-inclusives and thought the food was good and believe it or not, the Asian restaurant was the best. The staff were all very friendly. We never had a problem with noise except for one night when a group came into town very late and were very loud. We called down to the front desk to inform them and rather then taking care of it immediately, they asked us to be patient, as the group just arrived from Spain. The noise didn't stop for 20 mintues. That was the only negative experience. The beds aren't particularly comfortable but we weren't expecting much. The airconditioning leaked one night but was promptly repaired. Having a minibar in the room was a nice touch and they refilled it every 2 days unless you requested otherwise. We used a shuttle company to get from the airport, which cost us $50 per person round trip and next time will just take a cab for an additional $10-15 dollars because it took quite a long time to get to the RIU. Just make sure you give yourself enough time to get back to the airport (at least 1 hour 15 minutes). The beach is very calm and nice but can be quite crowded. We would just walk to the other resorts and many times just pulled the chairs away from the crowd. Playa del Carmen is a quick 5 minute and $5 cab ride. The gym located at one of the other RIU's is small but nice. We also went running several times and the bike/pedestrian sidewalk is an easy out and in (we also ran to Playa).

Musicians roamed the streets and people were in a party mood.I think the idea of a different place each night is still the most interesting for us. The only rip off was the snorkel tour that was arranged with an agent in the lobby. There were no fish,no fins,broken down boats and it was $130 US each. We went to the two other Riu's and they were also both very nice. We had great weather and a fun time. We did rent jet ski's next door at the other hotel and that was fun also.

Bathrooms at the beach restaurant had numerous things not working. Ice cream machine and drink machine stopped working and were simply covered up. My biggest concern was the smell of the room. It has a musty almost mouldy smell that was difficult to adjust to. I can still smell the scent on my suitcase and clothes. The air conditioner in the room had a three speed fan on it, but the temperature dial was not operational.

But of course I will add our whole experience in as well. It may be long, but full of advice :) Quick background: I will start off by saying we really enjoyed the resort. The people were very, very friendly and we didn't venture far from our original resorts to the others. The food was great all breakfast, lunch and dinner. We met fun people there and really enjoyed our stay. The beach was nice as for the pool areas. Yeah you may hear the beds are hard, which they are a little tough, but not that bad! As for the wedding, there were some great things about it, but there were some bad. The good news, the bad can be prevented after reading this review. My husband and I had never been to this resort before, but we knew we wanted to get married in Mexico. We got to the hotel on a thursday, was married that Monday and left on Saturday. So we had 10 days to spend at the place. 12 of our close family and friends joined us for our special event. So for the good, the bad and the secret advice for anyone wanted to get married there. First the good: Our location for our ceremony was on the beach at 5:00PM and the reception followed at 6:45. It was beautiful. All day the spot is blocked off so people won't lay there. The ocean scene in the back, the white chair covers and flower were great. Although we did not mind at all, its not entirely private. You will have on lookers during your ceremony, BUT the staff does a great job to keep the far enough back where they are not intruding. My bouquett was absolutley gorgeous, and it was the one included in the wedding package!! (by the way, we got the royal wedding package) Our wedding photographer, again included in the package, was wonderful. We could not have asked for better pictures. Our package only included 12 pictures, but we ended up buying all 75 cause they were so beautiful. I got my hair done at the local spa in the resort and they did a good job! My sister and I both really liked ours. The reception after was so pretty. We chose the steak house which was nice cause we were some what away from other guests and by the area we got married. The chairs had our white covers on them and the food was great. The timing was perfect for pictures after the ceremony, a drink or two and time to eat! After dinner we decided to hit the town and ended up at Senior Frogs in playa del carmen. Everyone went and it was a blast. I recommend going off site to keep the celebration going, especially if you are ready to have a good time with dancing and drinks. Okay now for the bad: I asked my wedding coordinator months in advance to send me how the ceremony would go, in which she did. I did not like the vows that were going to be said so I wanted my own, which the wedding coordinator said would be fine and she would pass it along to minister. So I emailed her our owns vows/ring exchange vows that we wanted. I brought them with me to Mexico and she even made a copy of them again so the minister would have them. So along comes the moment, I walk down the aile and am standing their with my husband. The minister starts, and it was clear he did not know what he was doing. The time came where I assummed the vows would be exchanged. So the minister flipps through a binder for a couple minutes as we stand there waiting. and then the time comes to finally say our vows/ring exchanged, BUT they were not the vows that I had given to the wedding coordinator. The vows I said and my husband said were completely different!! Needless to say at that point I was upset. Then during the ceremony he made us sign the wedding certificate and take a picture, then he proceeded on. Not only was our vows completely wrong, the minister had no idea what he was doing and it frankly was an awful ceremony. If it had been in the states, I would had been mortified, but it was Mexico so what do ya do!! Actually as for the wedding itself, that was the only big deal that went wrong. I guess to me vows mean alot when getting married, so I was very upset about the whole thing. As for some of the stuff you pay for in the wedding packages, not so good. For one, they decorated our bed a day too early(no big deal), we never recieved our complementary gift and the breakfast in bed was not good at all. All it consisted of was dry toast, fruit, meat and cheese platter and coffee. So basically the wedding packages are pretty expensive for what you really get with them. All in All it was a beautiful wedding at a pretty location. Our pictures were great, the food was good and we were in good company. Advice: # 1 and most important Make sure your ceremony goes exactly how you want it to. To do that, you must be in constant contact with your wedding coordinator, but more importantly see if you can get in contact with your minister. As you read, our minister pretty much ruined our ceremony. So if you want a special touch into your ceremony make that very clear and talk with your wedding coordinator as soon as you can when you get to the resort. Negotiate with your wedding photographer to get as many pictures as you want for a better price then your wedding package says. They are contracted in so have nothing to do with the resort. We were able to get a great deal for our photos by doing this. If you don't want to pay for extra flowers, we went down town playa del carmen and bought flowers and made my bridesmaid flowers for $2.50! We also picked flowers from the resort to put in their hair :) If you are not happy with some of your wedding stuff, complain. My dad complained about our minister and we got $300 back!! although we can't take back our ceremony, atleast we got some money back. We had a great stay at the RIU and even though there was some bumps in the road, we would recommend it to anyone.

On the positive side, the food was very decent and well presented and plentiful. We stayed next door at the Wyndham last time and my biggest complaint was the bad food. The main dining room at the Riu Playacar serves lunch and dinner and has a beautiful patio area very similar to outdoor eating at a good restaurant; we never had a problem getting a seat. Lunch is served very close to the beach and pool vacinity so there is no need to go far to each lunch. One day while on my way to lunch I saw the staff coming down the path with a wagon carrying a Paella Pan that was about 4 feet wide. They were on their way to the beach to serve Paella to the guests! Also, at least a few times a day the staff came down with large trays of beer and tropical drinks which they don't do at the Wyndham. The pool was large and beautifullly landscaped, with lots of shade if you wanted it. It had a swimup pool bar, which the Wyndham did not. The place was in general far superior to the Wyndham and when you calculate that the Riu provides free shuttle service to the hotel from the Cancun Airport, the price gets closer. However, if you are looking for a sophisticated Club Med type atmosphere populated by people from Los Angeles or Manhattan who travel often to St. Barts or St. Martin, this is not the place and I would say none of the Riu hotels in Playacar are. They do not attract that type of crowd. I have very few criticisms of the Riu Playacar, the staff went out of their way to make it fun. Each room's fridge is always stocked with bottled water and Corona beer. The beds are a bit hard and the rooms basic. If there was any disappointment, it was that this year there are huge sandbags in the water to prevent further erosion to the beach. They did not have that last time I was in Playa. Some people used them as a slide. I plan to go back again and would recommend the Riu Playacar to anyone who understands that they should not take the four star rating the hotels give themselves too seriously.

We booked it through the Riu website, it was a package deal that included our airfare, hotel and transfers. FLIGHT: We flew Frontier, the flight was on time and the bags were out quickly, so full marks to Frontier for that. Only irritation: no food for free, not even the nuts or chips. You could buy a sandwich, salad or snacks. On a international flight I except some food....oh well. TRANSFERS: Cancun airport was clean and quick, we were done and out with our bags in under 25 minutes. Our package included transfers, so we found the Riu rep in his blue t-shirt waiting just outside the exit. Had to wait almost 30 mins for the van and other travelers to show up, and then we were on our way to Playa Del Carmen (PDC). The ride takes about an hour, there was some construction, but almost no traffic at 5pm local time on a Thursday. CHECK IN/OUT: Was a breeze and they handed us our welcome drink. The lobby is open and airy, v.tropical. Service was friendly and warm. You could leave your bag for the bellhop to deliver, but we decided to just roll em down to our room ourselves. Check out was equally quick, we checked out at noon on a Monday, I don't know if the weekends are busier. ROOM: We were in building #5. The Playacar is the smallest Riu in PDC, with under 400 rooms divided into 6 small buildings. Our room was on the first (ground) floor. There are no elevators, so I was glad to be on the first floor. The room was also big, huge bed (2 doubles pushed together), the furniture looked in good condition. It was not luxurious or opulent, but it was clean and functional. We had a balcony, but never used it. I only noticed 3 things: the curtain liner was torn in places, the shower light would not work and the sink had no drain cover (don't let your rings fall off). Minor stuff, really, did not hamper my enjoyment of our stay at all. It is humid, and you can sometimes smell the dampness, but hey, you're in a jungle by the beach! Overall, I was satisfied with our room. The in-room bar was neat, but never used that either. The room had an ironing board, a hair drier, a dresser with 2 drawers, and a small fridge stocked with soda and water. TV had some english channels, we didn't really watch any TV, except for the weather. The mattress is v. firm, ask for a mattress topper if u are used to a soft bed. The towels and sheets were in good condition. The bathroom has a marble shower; separate toilet;a large vanity and one sink and a large closet with a safe in the dressing area that is separated from the room by curtains. HOUSEKEEPING: We had requested a roll-away, and it was already set up when we got our room. The room was cleaned well everyday, no complaints there. We got cute towel animals everyday as well. Asked for additional blankets/pillows, didn't get them right away, had to call back, and then we got them. THE BEACH: I love beaches, and this one was pretty nice. It was only a few minutes walk from our room (building 5 and 6 are closest to the pool/beach, but farthest from the lobby/main buffet). We had plenty of trees for shade, the sand was soft and wonderful. During our trip the weather was a lot cooler than normal and it was also very windy, the waves were choppy. On days that the sun did come out, the water was wonderfully warm. You could walk up and down the beach. We walked to the Yucatan and back. The big 'whales' are there, but it's no big deal...they don't really hamper your enjoyment of the beach. This was my first trip, if you've been there before, u might notice how the beach has been changed/damaged. But for first timers like us, it was still a great beach. I've been to various beaches - hawaii, florida, e.caribbean - and enjoyed this beach as well. Lots of chairs were always available. POOL: We didn't use it, they are not heated, and it wasn't warm enough. Lots of chairs were always available. The bar was fun, the drinks were pretty good. TOWELS: So they give u a towel card, and each person gets ONE, which u exchange for a towel near the pool. You will NOT get extra towels. So if you must have more than 1 towel for the beach or pool, get your own. If u lose the towel or card, it's a $20 fine, so keep those things safe. FOOD: Lots of variety, decent quality. B'fast was great, the smoothie bar was delicious. Lots of fruits at all the meals. The nacho bar was awesome. Overall, the food was pretty good. Desserts were mediocre. DRINKS: Free! Not top shelf, but still yummy. Alcohol flowed freely, lots of Pepsi products, juices, and an coffee machine for cappuccino, hot milk, milk coffee, espresso etc. They had bottled water in the room, which we carried around town/excursions. SISTER RESORTS: If you stay at the Playacar, you can drink/party at the Yucatan and the Tequila. These other resorts are huge, much larger than the Playacar and seem newer. The disco is in the Tequila, and it's freezing cold in there, but it was fun on Friday night. We went back on Sunday, and it was dead! The Pool bar at the Yucatan was great fun, J cruz...u rock. It was really cool to walk around and enjoy these other resorts. Can't go to the Palace hotels since they are considered a different (higher) level. ENTERTAINMENT: We saw the Mariachi band at the Playacar and the 'Ideal Couple' show at the Yucatan...both were fun. EXCURSIONS: you can book your excursions at the hotel lobby, lots of reps are available. They were not pushy. We just took the cab to PDC and took the 'colectivo' to Tulum and back. It was safe and cheap. Stopped at Hidden Worlds to do a quick $10 jungle canopy zipline. MISC. TIPS: If you're shopping, always bargain, a lot! Take lots of $1 and $5 notes for the cabs/tips etc. Exchange your $ for pesos if u want to shop a lot, we spent under $50, everyone accepts US$, but the exchange rate was 10 pesos to 1USD, instead for the 13 to 1USD that a bank would give u. For a little shopping, we didn't bother to exchange our USD. Playa Mart is like Hilo Hattie in Hawaii, all the possible souvenirs under one roof, good prices and good exchange rates for USD. CONCLUSION: I miss it already, it was tons of fun, they make sure you're having fun. I hope I can go back soon. A great vacation destination for friends or for a family.", "Date": "December 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cGreat time\u201d", "Author": "Mexicofan2", "ReviewID": "UR22755213", "Content": "Let me break down my review into categories: Service - We got to the hotel after traveling for many hours and was told by reception that they lost our reservation. After about an hour, they came back to us and told us they had taken care of everything. They gave us a 3rd Floor (highest floor) ocean view bedroom. The balcony was as large as the room and it had our own loungechairs. Food - We tried Jade, the Japanese restaurant, and was not impressed. It was the same food from the buffet. The buffet is large, and the food is great (not gourmet, but great). By the end of our 4 days there though, it did tend to get monotonous. Their Mexican dishes, however, are some of the best I have ever tasted. Pools/beach - we stayed next to the ocean. Yes, it has big black sand bags in the water, but after a while, you don't even notice they're there. The water is clear blue, and you can have boogie boards, canoes, and kayaks all for free. The pools also looked fun, however, we only went in for a few minutes the one day. Entertainment - We caught a few nights of their entertainment. The mariachi band was amazing. I may buy their CD. The Michael Jackson impersonator was funny, but not entertaining. The one night was dance lessons and seemed very family/kid-oriented. They do work tirelessly during the day to make sure you are having fun if you want to. Room - the bed wasn't too bad, and the maid service and mini-bar people made sure everything was stocked and clean. Travel - the hotel picked us up from the airport and dropped us off. An hours drive. They use hotelbeds.com. They use vans, not nice buses like Apple vacations. Deal with it. Alcohol - The drinks are in small glasses and they are made with well liquors, not top shelf. But you can get as many as you want, so stop complaining. As well, only beer is Corona (no Dos Equis). A few tips: 1. There are mosquitos! Bring along bug spray and anti-itch creme! 2. Go into Playa del Carmen. It's only a 50 peso taxi ride to 5th Avenue (roughly $5 USD) and its worth it. You can exchange for pesos at the front desk. 3. Go to Xel-ha and Tulum. Believe me when I say, you will not regret it. Tulum is breathtaking and Xel-ha is the best place I've ever snorkeled in my life (and I've snorkeled throughout the Carribbean) 4. Try to mix up where you eat for breakfast/lunch/dinner. You don't want to get sick of the buffet at Playacar. 5. With Playacar, you get entrance into Tequila, which has a nightclub there named the Pinata. Age range there is between 30-50. Not a place I would recommend for people in their 20s, or people on romantic getaways. 6.

The pool was big and the bar conveniently located. We liked the nightly entertainment shows too...kind of corny but fun. On the down side, the drinks used basic liquor and our whole group thought the alcohol was watered down. Not that we are heavy drinkers.. ..but it was pretty obvious. The beds were very hard and we had to ask for a cushion, which they delivered promptly and it worked well. The drink dispensers were not used by any of our group....as you really spend all of your time near the pool/beach or the restaurant. The beach was really screwed up though...with big sand bags all along the beach due to the beach erosion. So if you're going there for the beach, I'd recommend another area. Nonetheless, we played a few volleyball games with other beachgoers which was lots of fun.

It was our first resort vacation and our first trip to Mexico. We were so pleased with the professional and friendly service we found everywhere, at Riu Playacar, with our coordinating travel service, Lomas Travel, and our excursion company, who took us to Xel-ha and Tulum (booked thru Lomas). We consulted tripadvisor before booking our trip. It was difficult because so many places had a real mix of rave reviews and negative reviews, so I hope the following is helpful - 1. Food. I'm not a total foodie, but I do appreciate a nice meal prepared well using fresh ingredients, and Playacar totally delivered. I don't think you can expect better all-inclusive buffet food. A big variety of choices, we never went to one of the specialty restaurants because we enjoyed the changing options at El Porche (and sit outside on the porch for the best breeze!) Was it gourmet? No. But it sure wasn't Ryan's, Ponderosa, Cracker Barrell, etc. Much of the food options were prepared continental (European) style, which was a nice change. 2. Safety - We felt totally safe here. The reception people emphasized at check-in to use the safe in our room. I had never used a hotel safe anywhere before (traveling around US, Europe and north Africa). Because they strongly recommended it, we followed their lead. No problems - no one was tempted to take anything of value from our room. We even left a couple dollars on the dresser for the maid after our first night - when we returned it was still there. Lots of people left their bags on the beach as they went to swim. I never leave my bag unattended, anywhere, ever. To me, if you leave your bag somewhere, be prepared to say goodbye to it and its contents. This happens in your own grocery store as easily as it does in Mexico. 3. Accomodations. Yes, the beds were very firm and the pillows thin. If you're like me, being out in the sun all day, even just lying around, wears me out. Unless you have chronic pain or discomfort anyway, I bet you'll sleep like a baby. The towels were not new but they were big and very thick. There was hot water and great water pressure in the shower (what I really notice!) There was a little bit of a mildew/damp odor, but - guess what - you are in the jungle! The rooms were clean and stayed that way due to the thorough housekeeping service. The staff was very friendly. The entertainment/activities staff worked tirelessly - they were there by 10 every morning with the same crew putting on shows at the resort until 11 pm or later. I would recommend this place to couples, but even more so to young families. There were many young kids (but my no means did we feel we were at a kids camp) who were clearly having a ball. We booked through Funjet, had a direct flight to Cancun, bought non-stop transfers (shuttle to and from airport) with our package - I would highly recommend this - no hassling around with taxi drivers and other \"helpful\" service providers.

If you walk to the very far end of the beach way past the last hotel it is a quiet ,beautiful spot and good for snorkelling when it's calm,but please be cautious as we had our bag stolen from the beach which was a big shock to us as it didn't seem like anyone could gain access from the jungle at the back.

The rooms are basic but drinks are provided and topped up regulary. Entertainment was also good, with different shows on every night. Unfortunatly, when we returned from a day trip to cancun, i discovered my phone was missing, no forced entry to the room, and it had just been taken off the charger where i left it. This really upset us as the holiday was going so well. Sure, i should have locked it in the safe, but we were in a hurry to get out the room and had not done so. You just dont expect this to happen in such a lovely hotel. Security came to the conclusion that a member of the maintenance team had gone in and stolen it, let in by one of the maids. Nothing was done after that and i spent the rest of the holiday feeling uneasy and not wanting anyone near our stuff.

Well the rooms are decent but nothing special (although the towel animals are a nice touch) especially for 5 star. Entertainment is basically a dance show every night with a quickly wearing ice breaker before hand (basically embarassing games on stage but some people enjoy that so fair enough). We stopped going after a few nights. Resort is also about 30 mins (or 50 peso taxi ride) from town so shopping needs planning and the atmosphere of the hotel is not for the livelier youngsters.

Like others I stayed at the RIU Tequilla two years ago and was meant to be there again this trip, but because of referb was offered PLAYACAR, glad. Reception area - Big spacious and cool breeze blowing through, has a small shop selling some essentials, a little pricey. Shops accross the road not bad usual holiday nicknacks. I would recommend a trip into town by cab about $10 (\u00a35/6) to Walmart, hudge shop with most stuff including car tyres?? cheap to (Products not the Tyres) The reception has a bar staffed by barmen with unbelievable memory and fast to. There is comfortable seating and you will find most Holiday Reps hang around here in the morning. There are toilets which is handy for the bar. Off of the reception area you will find the main restaurant and the Chinese Restaurant called JADE, worth booking (the waiter has a few tricks up his sleeve which i still cant do!) Accomodation - There are 6 blocks of various colours situated either side of the main walk way to the beach. Each block contains approx 36 rooms. Stairs to top floors. The rooms are cleaned every day by very capable cleaners, they even make different animals out of the towels and put them on you bed! Mini bar is refereshed every other day, but ring ALDO (Remember him) if you need something it will be delivered. There is no light in the shower so a little dark but not really a problem unless you dont like the dark, and have just watched Psycho. Rooms have a safe (USE IT) We never had any problems but better safe than sorry. Each room also has a TV (not much for Brits to watch but hell didnt care) Theater and Theater Restaurant - Theater, Not much happens here during the day other that Rep orientation meeting and some where to run to if it rains or just want some shade and relax, you can even watch show rehersals. There is also a bar serving alcohol and coffee. Again bar staff just as cleaver as those in reception. the shows at night are very entertaining by both the performers and Entertainment staff Excellent. Restaurant - Serves lunch which is very good lots of different things. In the evening it sevres Mexican fare and Steak Dinner both need to be booked the morning you want it. Pudding show is quite good with the waiters and FIRE!! yes FIRE in little serving cups :-) and alcohol Pool area - Spacious with plenty of beds and no German towels Yippeee. You recieve towel tockens on checkin, the can be exchanged for swimming towels, if your towel gets to wet you swap it for another or if you have had enough get your token back. There are two pools one mainly for swimming and the other for playing and fun and games (will come to the later in a moment. In the swimming pool the is a ramp for those who cant use ladders. This also serves as the training area for you FREE yes FREE intro to Scuba Diving this needs to be booked in advance and worth it. The fun pool boasts a pool bar and again great staff with excellent memories. Here they play Water Polo, Volley ball and have entertaining games such as Iron Man, Belly Flop contest and water Basketball. This is also where you will find the entertainment staff a real good bunch who are there to make you stay fun, if you dont want to join in they will leave you in peace. Near the beach the pool is perfectly placed, it also has a toddlers pool. Oh i nearly forgot there is a Jaccuzzi too. The Beach - Some have moaned about the sand bags, however it did bother me as i didnt think they are that bad, if nothing else they arent bad for playing on and slipping into the sea (Just dont wear white swim wear!!) On the beach there are Sailing boats Kayaks, body boards and wind surf boards all free. If you head for the palace a 2 or 3 min walk along the beach there are Jet Skis at $60 for half an hour again need to book. There are plenty of sun beds some of which get hijacked by other different hotel guests. There is a Massage hut on the beach to they did have an offer on of $54 for a full body rub for an hour. THE BAD BIT !!!! - There wasnt enough no smoking areas, all the bars allow smoking, infarct it would be easier to say the only place you are not aloud to smoke is in the main restaurant or litterally your bed.

I have never stayed in a hotel with such a fantastic choice and selection of food. There is a lovely buffet in the El Porche Restaurant with a vast selection for breakfast e.g including smoothies, cheeses, cereal, fruit juices, bacon, sausages, omelettes, every variety of egg, toasts, jam, fruit and yoghurts. Dinner included a full selection of spicy mexican food, italian selection, salads, soups, carvery with amazing cuts of beef and lamb and enough choice to satisfy the most picky of eaters. We also sampled the 3 waiter service restaurants. The steakhouse menu was 5 courses, ceasar salad, a selection of fried onion rings, vegetables and spicy chicken wings, soup, a selection of steaks etc, and cake. We drank the rose wine throughout the meal and found it very nice. The Mexican restaurant had a selection of starters and we had a lovely steak but again there were a choice of main meals, followed by desert. The Asian restaurant had a wide selection of cold and hot starters including sushi, then a buffet selection including chicken kebabs, beef in a fantastic sauce, spring rolls etc. During the day there was a buffet lunch with a wide selection available and occasionally they had an outdoor barbecue with salads, jacket potatoes and various meats and it was pleasant to have lunch outdoors. There were also lovely touches like cocktails being served next to the barbecue in pineapples and coconuts. One day they even bought cups of chopped melon around the pool for everyone. The Service was impeccable from reception to waiters to cleaners. We had occasion to ring reception a couple of times because the mini bar or the optics hadn't been restocked and they sent someone immediately to resolve the problem. We had phone calls every other day from reception asking if we had any problems and asking if everything was okay. We went to Playa Del Carmen a few times and it is a nice resort but it does feel a bit like running the gauntlet down 5th Avenue which is the main area for bars, restaurants etc. Everyone is shouting for your attention and it resulted in us not going into shops rather than encouraging us and I would imagine they actually lose trade because of their incessant behaviour. We spoke to a lot of people who said the same thing and that they would rather pay a bit extra in the hotel and the shops over the road, than go to Playa and be hounded to purchase. We actually told one of the guys that it was putting people off and he replied that everyone else was shouting at the tourists so he felt he had to. We went to the Blue Parrot and it was a good experience but a lot of sand on the ground so be careful which footwear you have on. There was a fire show which was pretty good, about 5 people eating and dancing with fire. Be aware that if you see any entertainment in Playa you will be expected to contribute as they constantly come round collecting. We even had someone come upstairs in a restaurant who had been singing downstairs asking us to put something in her collection pot. This is something we aren't used to in the UK because if a bar has a singer or band on they pay for it not the customers. We went along to the Yucatan a few times and that also seemed like a really good hotel. Their entertainment area is bigger and seemed to have more of an atmosphere. They also had 2 sit around bars near the entertainment and one of the bar man I think called Alfredo was fantastic entertainment and made sure everyones drink was filled as soon as they had finished. The Yucatan also has an airconditioned disco upstairs open until 2am and they had a vending machine open all night where you could get a sandwich, hot dog or hamburger if you fancied one. Back to Playacar and you are given a card for your towels and there are usually a few books there to swap, so if anyone is a reader you might just want to take the one book and swap it over. The Entertainment was pretty repetitive on a night mainly being the same set of dancers, scantily dressed females and quite camp guys, but they did put their heart and soul into it. There was a mariachi show on one night and they went down a storm, brilliant musicians and an excellent singer. We travelled with Thomson Holidays and the flight from Newcastle was 12 and a half hours going as we had to refuel in Manchester. Although we had paid for meals it was actually 5 hours into the flight before we received anything to eat so I suggest if anyone is travelling from Newcastle they take snacks with them. The food is highlighted as being designed by Aldo Zilli on the Thomson flights and all I can say is I would be ashamed to put my name to them if I was him. Horrible grisly meatballs on the way out and chicken with some rubbery substance which could have been pasta or an omelette on the way back! The entertainment package is worth upgrading for \u00a35 as you get a choice of about 60 CDs and 10 films. All in all a fantastic holiday and I would recommend the Riu Playacar to anyone", "Date": "October 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cBeen Twice Already and I'd Go Back Again....\u201d", "Author": "RizzBits", "ReviewID": "UR20546638", "Content": "I stayed at the Riu Playacar about four years ago and then decided to go back this year again and take my best friend with me.

We stayed in a regular room with two queen sized beds. A word of warning: if you like a soft mattress, you may want to try and get yours from home through customs because the beds are very firm. By firm i mean hard. Other than that, the room is nice, the bathroom area quite spacious, the balcony has room for two with a table, and the best part is that every day the maid leaves happy little towel creatues and i have to say that every day it brought a smile to my face; just a simple thing like that. I will go back to the Riu again, i'm certain. I love the friendly people, (many other tourists vacationing are so pleasant and friendly...), and the staff is just as wonderful.

The hotel was very well maintained and very well managed. The room was very big and the ceiling was high. It had a small but very useful sitting area, balcony, huge closet, liquor dispenser with 4 huge bottles of strong alcohol. The shower/toilet area was separated only by a decorative curtain (no door), though the toilet did have a door but not the shower (the shower had a plastic curtain). Two swimming pools were busy but we always were able to find a free spot. Beaches in this area are still recovering from hurricane. No one beach is in good condition. As an alternative you can walk ~30 minutes down the shoreline until you reach wild unmanaged beaches. Those beaches are excellent. Don\u2019t trust the hotel\u2019s map that shows Riu as a complex of several Riu hotels on a nice green territory. There are some other hotels in-between so you cannot easily go from one Riu hotel to another. Hotel Tequila was so far away across the road so I even did not want to spend time checking it. The hotel\u2019s staff was very friendly and professional (except for the reception desk). We had an issue at check-in. They gave us (me and my daughter) a room with one king bed and when we came back to the reception desk asking for two beds they said we could separate the bed into two smaller beds. Only after they personally came to the room and realized that a king size bed cannot be split unless you cut it with a saw, they gave us another room with two beds. Telephone calls from hotel were very expensive so we used a calling card (10 USD for 40 minutes) and a payphone from a shopping center across the road right in front of the hotel. Cell phone calls to and from US with T-Mobile were 1.5 USD a minute. Do not use 1-866 number for calling hotel room from US. It is not a toll free number (will cost you about 2 USD per minute or more). We made only one trip during the week. We went to see Maya\u2019s ruins in Tulum (40 USD per person). It took about 1.5 hours to get there, about 1.5 hours there (~45 minutes of guided tour and ~45 minutes of free time) and 1 hour back. There were no changing rooms at the beach. Reserve more time when you travel around. Traffic was not smooth there. For example, it took us 2+ hours to get from the airport to the hotel, though the way back was less that 1 hour. The food was excellent and selection of food was very good. Two buffet restaurants served international food. Three specialty restaurants served local Mexican and Asian food. The food was the best part of our vacation. It was a very nice barbeque and coconuts party with live music and dancing at the pool on Thursday and a seafood party on Friday. The night entertainment was good too. I give 5+ to this place for excellent food and service.

It was a truly nice, and enjoyable family vacation. Although I am not a seasoned Mexico/Caribbean vacationer, I've been to Cancum (hotel zone) once, and Punta Cana DR once before, and with that said, I think Riu Playcar was the best. Two things within resort that I'd give an absolutely superior grade were accommodations, and dining. Room we've stayed at (4107) was REALLY nice, clean, comfortable, and absolutely nothing to complain about. Food - SPECTACULAR. For sushi lovers, there's an elegant Japanese restaurant/buffet \"Jade\" where you have all-u-can-eat sushi. Otherwise buffet \"El Porche\" should fit all your needs. Very clean and well kept, with ice sculptures, great fruit designs/decorations, friendly staff, and fresh, tasty food. I've heard a lots of complains about food quality in AI resorts, and even experienced it while on previous trips, but not while staying in Riu. I don't have an iron stomach like some people, but I was eating in a large quantities since it was so tasty, and was absolutely fine. There's also a Steak House restaurant, which we didn't try, but heard it was good too. Few words about the beach, and large sand bags laying on it. If these bags would bother you, than you should pick different destination. It's not the problem of this particular resort, but rather Playa Del Carmen in general . Every single resort in the area that I've seen has these bags since several hurricanes/tornadoes in the past wanted to steal all the sand. Many vacationers, including myself indeed found these bags very entertaining. It was good diving place, or you could lay/sunbath on it and get a water splash from time to time as waves were hitting them. Other than that, beach is very clean, and the water is unbelievable ( type of \"Corona commercial\" clear when close, and turquoise looking from far away). Very good entertainment throughout the day and every day different show in the evening (we've seen Mayan, Moulin Rouge, Michael Jackson). Staff nice and friendly, working hard to make all guests happy. Overall I think we spend around 30 bucks on tips, but I think these people well deserved it for their hard work.

General: The resort is clean and small enough to enjoy. The d\u00e9cor around the resort is outdated and certainly needs an upgrade. Mostly European visitors. Check in and check out is fast and efficient. Everything (dinner, lunch) opens and closes right on time...on the dot! You can visit Riu Tequila and Riu Yucatan \u2013 they're both along the same strip and a very short walk away. There's a small shopping area in front of the Riu Playacar with souvenirs, shirts, jewelry and knick knacks. Rooms: For three of us, there were two full size beds thrown together and a cot. I didn't expect to have a cot for the third person considering the cost per person to stay there. Again, the d\u00e9cor is outdated \u2013 reminds me of 70's motel-type d\u00e9cor. The rooms are muggy and smell of humidity when you first walk in. If this bothers you, ask the front desk to come spray the room. The room didn't smell again after we had it sprayed. The beds (as others reviews have noted) are hard \u2013 be sure to ask for a mattress pad when you check in if a hard bed isn't your thing. There's a safe in the room and you get the key during check in. Plenty of towels and hangers are in the room. There are no Beach: We are definitely beach people. The beach was amazing! There are some sandbags but nothing intrusive \u2013 most people were playing on them and having a good time. The water was turquoise blue and warm \u2013 there weren't any harsh waves. The beach or the sand are not rocky \u2013 we didn't need our water shoes at all! There are plenty of chairs \u2013 we got out early to get our chairs but there was no need, I hardly ever saw anyone not able to find a chair. The chairs need to be replaced though \u2013 most are broken and the headrest doesn't stay up/down. There are palm trees for shade and the area closer to the beach does not have palm trees if you want to tan or lay out in the sun. The last day, we took a walk along the shoreline of the beach and determined that Riu Playacar had the best beach \u2013 most other resorts had intrusive sandbags and therefore a smaller area available to swim in. People don't harass you to go parasailing, buy things, etc. once you say no so that's nice. Towels \u2013 get them by the pool area \u2013 you give them your towel card and when you return the towel, you get it back (be sure you return it by the time the towel hut closes or you have to wait until the next day). Food: Lots of variety. The food areas open and close right on time! Most of it was good \u2013 you found the general thing that wasn't tasty or appetizing but overall, we could always find something we liked. The specialty restaurants are definitely worth visiting. The steakhouse was the best \u2013 it was a sit down dinner and the waiters were attentive and great. The Asian was good too (good sushi) \u2013 this was buffet style. We left a tip for the waiters - they did such a great job! Downside to the food \u2013 it is NOT 24 hours as advertised. If you want 24 hours, we were told we had to go to Riu Tequila \u2013 don't know how true that is because we never went. But if you wake up early or are a late night person or have kids that eat a lot and want a snack \u2013 bring your own! People don't know how lines work when it comes to the food on the buffets. Nightly Entertainment: It always seemed empty but the other RIU resorts were always more lively and packed during the night shows. Pool/Jacuzzi: We didn't try the pool but there were people enjoying it. We tried the Jacuzzi one time and it was cold so we didn't try again. Check in/Check out: Was a breeze - quick and efficient.

Fantastic location, right on the beach in a safe area. Would rate hotel about a 4*. Most reviews have covered everything but would say top tips - request a mattress topper immediately and then the beds are fine. Also you have liquor dispensers in the room - leave a note for the staff with a small tip and they'll change the bottles to your favourites. I only tipped housekeeping at the end of our stay but they left towel art on the beds every day. Found the food excellent, lots of variety - and entertainment staff brilliant. No pressure to join in - but they're your best friends if you do! Reception staff dealt with queries adequately - but they could learn to smile a bit - my daughters found them very intimidating! Bar staff throughout hotel seem to really enjoy their jobs and are really friendly and entertaining. I would add that some of the shows are repeated if you have a two week stay - and the dance shows are the same dancers, doing same dances it seemed, just wearing different outfits. Hotel itself generally very clean - but room towels could do with replacing - a bit threadbare and tatty. Seen no bugs at all, other than a few ants on our balcony. Beach and sea is gorgeous - erosion a real problem and the 'whale' sandbags are a real eyesore for anyone wanting a dreamy tropical view (I've attached a photo). That said, everyone loved playing, diving, swimming off them so there is a plus. One disappointment - for an all inclusive, food stops at 10.30am until luchtime, 3.30pm until dinner, and then 9.30pm. If you wanted any snacks on meals in between, you had to travel to the Yucatan hotel, about a 200 yard walk. Not a big problem as food is plentiful at mealtimes, but I just found it unusual for an all inclusive. Pottery painting hut on beach is great fun for all ages, very therapeutic, inexpensive and make great gifts to take home.

Our travel agent booked us through Apple Vacations. We had to wait outside for our Apple transport from the airport for over an hour to begin our drive to our hotel, and had to make a few lengthy stops on the way. We were welcomed at the front desk with a tropical cocktail and check-in was fairly quick in spite of being questioned several times about my electronic (printed) travel documents. We only had about a half hour to get settled before our scheduled meeting with \"Jimmie\" from Apple Vacations to make our tour arrangements and schedule our return to the airport. When we met with Jimmie, we scheduled the only tour we wanted to take, which was to Chichen Itza. The resort itself was nice enough, but expect nothing above 3 star ratings. There are no beach view/front rooms, which was disappointing. The open air foyers echo and are quite noisy. There are some VERY loud birds that get to sqawking before 6am every morning. We didn't mind the beach, or lack there of it, in the least. We always found somewhere comfortable to be and the water was blue and beautiful. The huge sandbags did look like beached whales, but they were fun and quite challenging to climb on, and they are serving the purpose of regaining the eroded beach. We did spend most of our time during the day at the RIU Yucatan, or out and about. The Yucatan had better daytime entertainment and we enjoyed the setting there better than Playacar--you could be close to the bars/entertainers and still see ocean everywhere. Their lunch seemed comparable to Playacar's, so it really didn't matter where you were for that meal. We also visited the RIU Tequila, but it was just really muggy and hot, (across from the beach)--we didn't get why people think it's so great, but to each their own. The staff at Playacar was friendly, the drinks were often lacking, the food was okay, entertainment was pretty decent. --The staff: front desk were fine, the bartenders were friendly and hilarious, people were constantly sweeping/cleaning, our room was adequately tended to daily, we were promptly brought requested items for the mini-bar, the waiters at the reservation and buffet restaurants were very good --The drinks: yes, they were plentiful. However, there were some frequent miscommunications--we asked for a White Russian, got a glass of Zinfindel. Asked for 2 Pina Coladas with Bacardi, got a Pina Colada and a Rum and Coke. Don't forget to specify premium liquors though--we had some very funky tasting Margaritas and Daquiris because of cheap booze. They also used way too much of some of the syrups--made the drinks taste disgusting. (We found MUCH better drinks down at the Yucatan!) The food: we found that the buffet was as good as anything. There was a lot of variety, and they did it up with melon and ice carvings. We did the Asian one night--it was good, but we were disappointed that it was buffet. The sushi there was decent and the fried rice was probably the best I've ever had. We did the steak reservations one night and loved the beachy location. The atmosphere was nice, but the food was just okay. I had the \"ribeye\" and it was at least half fat/grissel. We didn't try the mexican, but the display of what they serve looked appealing. Again, the buffet suited us fine--if you can't find anything to eat there, you're probably just too picky and would do better to go into town and choose what you want. Our room: Very strange at times. We requested a king bed, but had 2 beds pushed together. Very difficult when we wanted to snuggle. One of us would have to \"hop the divide.\" The hotel sent a little basket of fruit and a note to our room for our anniversary with of all beverages, a bottle of cheap tequila :) The liquor dispenser was a new one for us--there are literally 4 fifths of alcohol in your room! We only had a few drinks in the room, but it was nice when you're getting changed or taking a break. The mini-bar had sodas, big bottles of water, and 3 Coronas in it. They didn't stock it everyday, but I called the front desk twice to ask for more beer and water, and they brought it up quickly. The guy who cleaned our room was such a sweetie. The first 2 days we had towel art, and one day we even had confeti--that was a new one, confeti in our bed! We tried to get most of it into the trash can before bed, but still ended up with it scattered from one end of the room to the other. It took forever for us to get the room cool, and if you walk onto the balcony to search for some kind of view, the air turns off. There's no light in the actual shower, and all the light switches in the room are strangely located and a puzzle to solve. Oh, I almost forgot--the top cover/bedspread on the bed is literally a lined curtain. I actually felt the backing of the curtains and compared it to the bedspread and it was the same. We took these off after we discovered soft blankets in the overhead of the closet. Apple Vacations Rep. at the hotel: I know this isn't the hotel's fault, but I have to mention the rep who set up our Chichen Itza tour. He told us to be in the lobby at 7:50, and after sitting for over an hour, we found out that our tour had left without us at 7:30. He had given us the wrong time!!! After a lot of hassle with Apple (having to stay in our room waiting for phone calls, etc. for hours) we were set to go again the next day at 7:30. Again, we sat and sat and were then told that it was rebooked, but \"for another day.\" We were leaving the next day and never got to go on the one tour we wanted to go on. After contacting Apple, they did apologize and sent us 2 vouchers for a future trip, that we can never use because they depart out of cities 1,000 plus miles from us (It would cost more to get there than the hundred bucks off). Thanks for nothing Apple--if you can, choose another company!!!! Also, I hope Jimmie, the rep at Playacar, is now down at the docks trying to sell time shares. He was a jerk. Overall, we did enjoy the RIU Playacar and our stay in Playa del Carmen. Some came thinking it was a five star resort for some reason. It is NOT a five star resort, but if you're not overly fussy and up-ity, you'll enjoy yourself. It would be better with some service (food/beverages) at the pool and beach. It is only a 5 minute, 5 dollar cab fare into town, so be sure to go in and spend some time. We took the ferry over to Cozumel for the day and really enjoyed it a lot. We also heard that Zel Ha and Xcaret are both really nice...we were just too busy trying to get to Chichen Itza and all the other tours had already left by the time we found out we were left hanging! Next time maybe we'll get there, but it will probably be from a different resort than RIU Playacar.", "Date": "August 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cThese is the real true about Riu playacar\u201d", "Author": "jirafitas", "ReviewID": "UR19235403", "Content": "Riu Playacar is not all what it is cracked up to be. I was disappointed in numerous ways. I worked for a market research firm dedicated to helping its clients better understand the needs and preferences of their customers. & have been traveling to Cancun in the past 10 years stayed at many other resorts in the Cancun & Riviera Maya & nothing compare to the Riu Playacar, unless these is the only place you known or you live similar like the hotel these is the worst Resort in the whole place. Pool area I was disappointed that the pools are overcrowded with very hot contaminated water, we got ear infection after the 2nd day we stay there, also you need to have cards to get a beach towel, and not enough beach chair or umbrellas to protect you from the sun. Other hotels have a waiter/waitress at the pool). But at Riu you either had to get in the pool or walk around to get a drink. Food: The food was buffet style is OK the workers are amazing to please you the only problem is the roach infestation they crawl everywhere. And for the other restaurants you need to get up at 7am to reserve for the steak, seafood or Mexican, also there are no coffee pots in the rooms. Entertainment: These is the only thing I like about Riu we went to one show The Maya show it was very good . The entertainment crew works very hard day and night to keep everyone happy and entertained. I thought they were excellent. Room: The beds are hard. Plus I ended up getting bitten by bed bugs while I was there as well... The room we stayed in was in need of a good deep cleaning, there is going to be some mildew, but the ceiling in our shower definitely needed to be cleaned & repair. The grout in the rest of the room (especially the bathroom), also could have used a thorough cleaning. Additionally, our shower did not drain properly which left us standing in about 4 inches of water each time. The beds are pushed together to make one large bed with one headboard. If you ask for 1 king size bed, it's a smaller room with a much smaller bed. Do you like to be woken up by loud and rowdy people & buses coming in & out from the next door hotel because the walls are so thin you hear everything and you end up not getting any sleep? be careful of hard beds, & thin walls you hear everything if you want to rest, plus the musty smelling rooms. Bath Towels: Time to get some new ones. The ones we had were raggedy and faded. Definitely not the towels I'd put out for your guess unless they are homeless. Riu Playcar really needs to re-upholster their outside restaurant chairs. Sometimes I didn't want to sit down because of all the mildew. (Yuck!) Beach I was incredibly disappointed with the beach erosion. They lost a lot of beach there. (Not like they had a lot to begin with). Then, they have, as mentioned in a lot of other reviews, a lot of huge sand bags on the beach and in the water, the bags make the water smell so bad like sewer There was also quite a lot of seaweed to swim thru, making the experience a lot less enjoyable. Security mayor problem with security rooms keys are actual keys and not key cards. Room number is printed right on the key so doesn\u2019t loose it? The Safe box is also operated with a key. I accidentally forgot my room number and I opened someone else room.

We met a friend in Cancun who also stayed with us at the hotel. This was my second time at the Riu Playcar (first time was pre-Katrina in 2005). Although I definitely had more fun this go-round, due to participating in more activities (scuba, deep sea diving, swimming with the dolphins, etc.), this time around, I definitely had more complaints about the property than I had before. Room: Yes, the beds are still hard. Pretty sure I ended up getting bitten by bed bugs while I was there as well... The room we stayed in was in need of a good deep cleaning.

Definitely not the towels I'd put out for company. El Porche Buffet Restaurant: Special kudos and thanks to my man Tomas for helping me out by providing me with some special bread for my \"wheat-free\" diet due to an allergy. I'm still waiting for him to e-mail me the recipe. I appreciated his taking the time to walk me thru the entire buffet selection letting me know what things were off limits and those which I could let loose and enjoy. Yes, eating buffet got a little old after a couple of days. We did eat at one of the specialty restaurants once while we were there--the Steakhouse... Unfortunately, due to my allergy, I couldn't eat much of the appetizers. Upon learning of my allergy, however, they arranged for some of my special bread to be brought down from the other restaurant. Again, I appreciated them catering to my special needs. The steak was good as was the salad. I wish I could have eaten the baked Alaska. It was fun to watch them light the liquor on fire and put on a show before they lit the cake. Wish I had taken my camera for this. BTW--they did bring me some plain strawberry ice cream so I wouldn't feel left out. (One additional comment about the restaurants...) Riu Playcar really needs to re-upholster their outside restaurant chairs. Sometimes I didn't want to sit down because of all the mildew. (Yuck!) Beach: I was incredibly disappointed with the beach erosion. They lost a lot of beach there. (Not like they had a lot to begin with). Then, they have, as mentioned in a lot of other reviews, a lot of huge sand bags on the beach and in the water. There was also quite a lot of seaweed to swim thru, making the experience a lot less enjoyable. (I was even more disappointed when I took a stroll down the beach to the Sandos Hotel and saw how huge and beautiful and clean their beach was. They also have hammocks and a whole lot more chaise lounges. Their showers also actually worked. Problems: Had an incident while we were at the hotel on our last day. I let my son go back to the room to get some rest while my friend and I stayed at the pool for awhile. After about an hour, I went to check on him. No signs he'd even been in the room. After three hours of searching for him, with the help of the Playacar police and all the available hotel staff (thank you), it turned out he had entered the building on the wrong side, counted doors, and gone into the wrong room without realizing it. The problem with this is, both our room keys opened this other person's room. Therefore, one has to wonder about security. Thank goodness my son turned up before I had a heart attack. I really appreciate the prompt attention the hotel staff provided in looking for him (including putting out an announcement over the P.A. system at the pool), but honestly, this whole thing could have been avoided if they had more secure doors on the rooms. I would guess this may be the reason for the numerous thefts previously reported by other guests at this hotel. Hopefully they actually fix it... Other than the above, we all really enjoyed our time at the Riu. Customer Service at the front desk, all the restaurants, and also the bars was phenomenal! I feel like I made friends while there and would definitely like to return if not just to see them again. After seeing the Sandos, however, I might consider checking them out too.

IT HAS GONE ! unfortunately and sadly, the beach is eroding , and has bean for the last 2-3 years. It is so bad that from the Iberostar hotel right the way up to Playacarmen , where I might add you could at one time walk on powder soft sugar white sand, is now completely awash with what looks like thousands of beached whales.

The hotel was a great choice - we visited the Tequila (heard that this is closing in August for a refurb), and although it was nice and a good alternative for a night out, we liked that the playacar was smaller and more intimate. We had read reviews before travelling and i was getting a bit worried about comments on valuables being stolen - i am always cautious wherever i stay, but we never had any trouble or problems during our stay. We kept valuables in the safe and kept our suitcases locked with any other valuables when we were out. Rooms - We stayed at building number 5 which was close to the pool area and beach. We had a ground floor room with a balcony which was nice. The rooms were quite basic, but cleaned daily and had everything we needed including a minibar that was stocked every other day with bottled water, beer and soft drinks. They advise you not to use the tap water, even for brushing your teeth, we used the bottled water which we found fine - they will always re stock if you run out. following other reviews about the beds being hard, yes they were, but i find this on most holidays. The day we arrived i phoned reception and asked for some mattress covers - the maid arrived soon after and put them onto our bed, and these made the beds more comfortable. The only thing we found, and heard others mentioing it round the pool was that the towels in the room smelt of damp. They were changed daily and sometimes smelt ok, but for the majority of the stay they smelt a bit funny - certainly did not ruin the holiday though! There was a slight smell of damp in the room, probably related to the air con, but again nothing major (although when i returned home and opened the case, all of my clothes had that familiar smell!). Food - there was so much choice and variety! There would be themed nights in the buffet, and lots to choose from. There also some speciality restaurants, we tried the steak house and the asian restuarant, this was our favourite. For these the they two sittings, 6:45 and 8:45, and you book at breakfast for that evening. Location - we were about an hour from Cancun, and a five minute taxi ride ($5) to playa del carmen. It was nice to be able to walk freely out of the resort to local shopping areas. Playa del carmen 5th avenue has lots of shops bars and restaurants and makes a nice change in the evening. We went into cancun on the Thomson bar crawl it was nice but very very busy - we liked playacar as it was quiter but still had the nightlife if you wanted it. Staff - all staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and could not do enough to help you with any queries you had. In particular the entertainment staff or \"animacion\" team worked so hard - they were there early mornings and for the evening shows - there was always lots of activities going on around the pool to get involved with if you wanted to. Weather - the day we arrived there was a storm and i was worried there would be no sun for our holiday! this soon lifted and we had many days of sunshine which was nice. we did a couple of trips - the captain hook dinner cruise was fun, and a snorkelling trip where we swam with turtles, sting ray and baracuda! The beach has eroded quite abit as others have mentioned, however if you walk along further there are some nicer bits. The sea is lovely, really clear. The pool area is also nice, the pool bar is busiest but there is another pool which seemed to be quiter. We would definately return to Mexico, we had a great holiday, cannot fault it all - we met some lovely people which made the holiday even more enjoyable.", "Date": "June 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis", "Title": "\u201cA Great Place to Visit\u201d", "Author": "rsumms", "ReviewID": "UR17190482", "Content": "Playa del Carmen, Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico: A great place to visit! The Hotel was just what I was expecting from the other reviews that I had read. Our room, the resturaunts, main building, pools, and grounds were kept very clean. The people working at the hotel in all positons were always very friendly. Our room was very nice and clean. The air-conditioning worked well for those of you who need it cool in the evenings. The in room mini-bar was nice and was kept with bottled water al the time, although we did not use it much since it was an all inclusive we stayed at the bars socializing. The matress was hard, but again as stated in other reviews, we asked for and revieved right away a matress cover which did help a little. The two pools were very nice, never overly crowded, including the pool bar. Just as I read in the reviews, there was not much music or pool games. This hotel is for the person who wants to be secluded without a lot of people or being bothered with noises. There were a few children but not many. Everyone we met there, guests, were also very friendly. The resturaunts were nice. the food at the Steak Resturaunt was alright, better steaks in St. Louis. The Asian Rresturaunt was great. I did not think I would like that type of food, but it was wonderful. All the buffets were good also. There was a large variety of food at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I wish someone would of told us of the beach. We were told two years ago Wilma, hurrican, came through and took away 100 feet, approx., of beach front.

The riu hotels are brilliant! We stayed in the playacar area, just less than an hour down from Cancun which is an ideal location as you are within easy access of all the trips/sites, but in a much quieter more beautiful area. When we got there it was raining, which i wasnt too surprise about as we had chosen to go at the start of the rainy season! But from then onwards it was sunny and boiling hot all day. We stayed for ten days, it only rained on the first and last day, so we were quite lucky for that time of year! The hotel itself is beautiful, and right on the beach, with huge pools and a swim up bar! In terms of beaches, so far ive been all around europe, north africa and to some of Australia, but Mexico's beaches were by far the best ive seen, beating bondi! If youve been to the caribbean/indian ocean i suppose you are used to it, but the beaches are pure white sand and actual green blue sea, its beautiful. Anyway, the service is excellent, and there is no pressure to do anything like you find in other places, no one will hassle you to get involved with anything if you dont want to. There are loads of free activities and watersports, windsurfing, trying scuba diving, kayaking, all free! Also tennis courts, ping pong etc. I usually go half board, so this was my first all inclusive holiday, and i loved it! Alcohol is all included aswell, like all alcohol, any cocktail you want, or just anything really. The food was good, for me places like Egypt and Tunisia have more vegetarian food, but my boyfriend loved it, and i never went hungry! As for trips, they all sound amazing, normally im tempted by one or two, but this time i wanted to go on them all! We went to Tulum whihc has a very very beautiful beach and lots of Mayan ruins. Th tour feels quite long in the heat but the guides are brilliant. We also went on dolphin discovery where you can swim with manatees and sea lions as well which is really fun and a bit different, and we went ona speed boat trip wihich is amazing. You ride your own speed boat through the mangroves and then go sonrkelling on the World's second largest reef! you could easily spend 2 weeks lying by the pool/beach with free alcohol and get a really good tan, or you could go on all the trips, i would recommend taking extra money for them as otherwiise they charge more to convert it and so on. Only bad points were mosquitoes. Definitely take loadddds of repellent as thye just get everywhere! And id leave dolphin discovery till teh end of the holiday as you cant wear suncream with the dolphins, so we got burnt!

We flew Skyservice. Flight was fine, a bit of turbulance. Otherwise fine. We arrived at 10pm at the hotel. Before we officially check-in they had food waiting for us at the buffet, which was great! Rooms are nice. Nothing to be WOW!! about. Average, clean and well kept. Beds are pushed together to make a king, a bit hard, but I don't mind that. Shower area nice, and clean, seperate washroom area. Although if you are a light sleeper, you can hear everything very early as 5:30-6am. Food: Buffet breakfast and dinner is good. Lots of varitey, and theme nights. A la carte dinner is nothing better than the buffet. We ate the steakhouse, it was good, but no big deal. Didn't bother with the Mexican restaurant, as they served that everyday, for dinner, and we didn't bother with the Asian. Although we did sneak into the Riu Tequila for dinner, much better food and more variety. We managed to go there twice, before we got busted....hahaha.. You can only go there for breakfast and lunch. But its worth the try if you can!!! Pool/ beach: Pool is nice, plenty of room, expect it can get crowded when they have pool activities; such as aerobics and water polo. There are plenty of chairs to choose from, but the huts are usually all gone by 9am. The beach on the other hand was disappointing. I did hear that there was still some damage to the beach due to hurricane Catrina, but I didn\u2019t realize it was that bad. Don\u2019t get me wrong the water is beautiful, but there are huge sand bags in the water\u2026.they looked like beached whales. Also along the shore too, there are sand bags too. When you walk in the water it is very rocky, but as you walk in further its better, but there still are some pretty big rocks, so be careful, I must have stubbed my toe at least a dozen of times. Also you can\u2019t just walk from your beach chair to the ocean, it\u2019s like a little hill that\u2019s about 4-5feet down. The hurricane just ripped these poor beaches apart. It\u2019s not that bad, if you walk along to the other hotels, some are worse than others. At first it is disappointing, especially if you have been to other amazing beaches, but you make the best of it and have fun. After your first day, they don\u2019t even bother you anymore. They are trying to restore and re-build the beaches, but it\u2019s going to be another couple of years before it\u2019s complete Grounds : The grounds are nice, not a huge resort, the lobby is a fair size, just average. The Lobby and grounds at the Riu Tequila are much bigger and better, but I guess that\u2019s because its across the street and is not on the beach, so they have to make up for it. We also visited the Riu Yucatan, as you can go there too. Again, nothing special, and the buffet is not good at all, in comparison to the Tequila and Playacar Activities and Entertainment : We didn\u2019t stay at our hotel for the entertainment. But did watch a show at the Tequila. It was o.k, a lot of dancing and nice to watch\u2026but after it was all the same stuff\u2026. We ended up going to Fifth Ave. You must go there for shopping. Tons of stores, bars, restaurants, pubs, cafes ect\u2026It is sooo nice there. Especially at night. Feels like your in your own little town. Everyone just walks the streets and browses. Went to a nice restaurant called Casa Aqua. Excellent food, just pricy. Its only a $5 cab ride. Departure and Check Out : Our departure flight wasn\u2019t till 9pm, so we spent most of the day at the beach. If you want late check out, its $50US extra, only if your room is not booked for the next people to check-in. In my opinion it\u2019s not worth it and no need. They have private shower areas in the lobby next to the bathrooms, where they provide soap and shampoo and a towel. So that\u2019s what we did. They hold onto your luggage in a secured room that is locked, so need to worry about your luggage. Check out was easy and very fast! Conclusion Riu Playacar is a nice hotel. If you are beach person you might be a bit disappointed, if you don\u2019t care for the beach and don\u2019t mind a 5mins walk/ 2min shuttle ride to this beach from the Tequila. I would say stay at the Tequila, as its overall appearance is much nicer, and food is better. If the price is good, book, if not then I would reconsider. Yes it is nice, but I wouldn\u2019t go back again, as I know there are better hotels out there. It\u2019s an older hotel, so it\u2019s not like the recently new Riu\u2019s in Aruba, or Los Cabos.

We had our bags taken to the room, the room was a nice size, very very clean, seperate toilet, shower and a little dressing room area with curtains sepparating the room from this area.Comfortable beds, a safe and the room had a great balcony with a couple of chairs to chill out on at night or in the morning. The room also had optics which was really fun! choice of vodka,rum,brandy and of course the famous tequila! also a fridge with pepsi, orange, 7up, corona and water. The fridge was re stocked every 2 days. Food was fantastic, good choice of food, good variety each day, different themes, waiters were lovely. Iam quite fussy with my food and i didnt have a problem eating, i was very satifised every day. There are 4 types of restaurants buffet style, mexicano, asian and steakhouse. We ate at the mexicano twice it was lovely, you get a choice of mains with buffet style starters and a great pud, i was stuffed! The food was excellent. If you want to eat at the themed restaurants just book with one of the waiters at breakfast, they give u a time slot and tell you where to go. The pool area was lovely, 2 large pools one with a swim up bar and jacuzzi and the other with a volley ball net and a disabled ramp. There was plenty of sunbeds for everyone in the sun and shade. The hotel also had a towel service so you could get fresh beach towels everyday. The bar by the pool offered a great variety of drinks for everyone, we really enjoyed the cocktails they were delicious! The beach was nice although the sea could be a bit rough sometimes, again lots of sunbeds and water sports to do. There was plenty of things going on during the day at the hotel, the entertainment staff were wonderful, kept us ammused each day with a good variety of games such as horseshoe, boules, shooting, aqua gym, bingo and kayaking in the pool!!!!

First impresion was that the entrance was not as stunning as other Riu hotels that I have stayed in. Showed to our rooms, disappointingly all the worries that I had (read reports about) before travelling regarding the damp smell in the rooms were unfortunately correct. It really was appalling. We returned to reception, were showed 5 more rooms, but only one was marginally better. No Thomson Rep in resort , they were all at a meeting! , no telephone number to contact them neither at reception or in the Handbook..not good representation.,so we had to contact Thomson in London. at cost to us of \u00a320+. After 5 hours the rep arrived, we had to sleep in smelly rooms for the night , then were up-graded to Suite rooms the next day. If you can run to the extra cost its worth doing the rooms are fantastic. From then on the Managemant could not do enough for us, it was obvious that they are trying their utmost to support the 4* rating awarded to this hotel. The food was top notch, at least 5*, I have travelled widely around Asia, US, Africa, UK and the Caribbean, the food has surpased most of the 5* resorts that we have stayed in. Sushi, Smoked Salmon, beautiful cooked joints of Beef, Lamb, Pork, Mexican delights, fresh fruits and salads and the best Juices and smoothies that I have ever tasted. Our rooms were cleaned daily and the beds were comfy, but although we tipped our cleaner we only got a couple of the lovely towel art , shame. Optics/ fridge was topped up every 3 days, however they will top-up in between if you ask..politely. In fact anything you require in the room will be done quickly. and with a smile. We were saddened to see that the beach had been eroded by the waves and the recent tropical storms, in fact we had a storm during our stay, and 3 palm trees were lost. We had not visited since the Hurricane 'Mitch' struck Playacar, 10 years ago, it seems sad that every storm erodes the beach. It was too rough to swim for most of our stay, but the pools were good so not a problem. There is two pools, one we found quieter, (the top one) and the pool bar - pool with jacuzzi, where most of the games are played. Try the aqua - aerobics they are fun and it works some of the food and drink off. !! The animation team are enthusiastic but not pushy, if you want to sit close by and watch...thats ok. You don't get dragged to take part. The dance and Mayan shows were wonderful, and the Mr & Mrs hilarious. But wear your Mossie repellent in the evening they are vicious. The Ice sculpture is good to watch, and try to guess what creature he is creating. Very clever. The BIKINI/SARONG outdoor show is very good, while the men are watching you can spend his money...I promise you he will not notice... Reception staff especially Wim are very helpful, anything you are not sure about they will do their best to help/ find out for you. Please if you have any problems however small do ask , they really know their stuff. Medical, tours and trips, local taxies or buses. Sailing lessons are available we found out and they issue certificates in English, so they are valid in Europe too. If you get a Riu card, you get 20% discounts from any of the shops or the water sport centre. Earn points to spend on future visits from your stays at all Riu hotels. If you visit I would like to ask you to say Hi to David and Rafael in the dining room, they are great and made our dining a real pleasure. I was'nt made aware of any of the issues rearding stealing in the Hotel, in fact the opposite, someone lost their purse in the ladies loo in the swimming pool, it was handed in at reception, with monies intact. and a bracelet was found in the dining room and handed in by staff. But you have to be sensible wherever you go and use the safe, thats the beauty of All-Inclusive you never need money. Wear your valuables then lock away, like at home, don't leave in full view. Okay summing up:- +Great holiday, fantastic cuisine, Well run hotel, Suite rooms fabulous. Friendly helpful staff. Weather wonderful. - Smelly rooms not good if you are asthmatic, but complain don't suffer. Beds firm but ask for waffle toppers. We all had a great relaxing holiday. ps ..swim with the dolphins, and visit Tulum the dragons! are huge... Any questions e.mail me and I will try to help.

I will try to be thorough without repeating too much of what has already been said about this wonderful resort (though hard, because what has been said is exactly how we feel about the Riu Playacar). Checkin: The front desk couldn't find our reservation. I thought about calling Cancun.Com (loved Cancun.Com!) and have them deal with the front desk. But, the front desk, told us (it was only noon) our room wasn't ready. \"After you finish your welcome drink, I will give you your wristbands, then you go enjoy the hotel. Leave your bags here, they are safe and come back in a couple of hours to get your room, don't worry about the reservation\". We didn't worry because they were so nice at the front desk and we got back everything was fine. The Resort: My first impression was wow! Wide path full of palm trees on each side, birds chirping, breeze blowing, which led us to the pool (and the pool bar). Though it was noon, plenty of loungers still were unoccupied, with no towel to reserve them. The pool appeared to be a nice size, though when later used (wading, floating-much later in the week, kids playing water polo and football), it was a little on the small size. No matter, it was glorious! The path continues from the pool to the beach. Again, no crowds. The waves were gentle that first day but rough thereafter. I was awed by the beauty of the beach, I read so many reviews about the beach being \"gone\" that I was surprised how nice and big it really was. We then went onto the Tequila to see it's pool and sports bar. The Tequila's pool had a rock waterfall and a little larger. The sports bar was a nice touch. No beach access though. Room: Room 5225 - Building 5 closet to the pool and beach. Second floor, great location! This is a small resort, so no matter where your building is, it is close to everything! We got to our room and we found nothing to complain about. Plenty of storage, nice shower (large step and a little slippery when wet) and plenty of space on the vanity. I found it odd to have packets of shampoo instead of bottles. Large closet with enough hangers for us and the safe, which was easy to use since you needed a key (don't lose the key!) to use it. We had room in the closet for our three bags, though there is space on a dressers to stack them. The TV had many English statiions and a remote. The balcony was a nice size and had two plastic chairs and a plastic table. Our clothesline was bent so we couldn't use it. No musty smell in our room at all. Our mini fridge was filled with Pepsi (no Pepsi Light), bottles of Corona and huge bottles of water. The Optics held brandy, scotch, vodka and Jose Cuervo tequila. We sat on the bed and it was hard!! We went down to the lobby and ask for a cover and extra pillows and they arrived before we got back to the room. One more thing, we never heard our neighbors or any cleaning carts. We did get our morning alarm of chirping birds each and every morning. What a wonderful way to wake up! Food: The buffets were delicious! Breakfast had fresh bread that you could toast and great preserves, fresh fruit, eggs, bacon (everyday), sausage, juices in all different flavors and omelets to order. The servers were quick and we had coffee and water on our table before we sat down with our plates. This buffet was served just off the lobby in air conditioning. Lunch was an outdoor affair with some of the stuff left over from the night before, but the food from the night before was so delicious, that we were glad! The grouper at our first lunch was outstanding! Salad bar fixings and guac, pico and chips were in abundance! There is a Corona tapper to get your own beer. For dinner we did the buffet mostly and we were glad! We loved the food. Once we had fresh grouper, once we had duck the next night was sushi (not bad!!!). We did try the steakhouse (outdoor dining with a beautiful view of the ocean), I loved my Rib Eye! We then tried the Asian restaurant and the same sushi was there and outstanding spring rolls (I got sa few of those!). The dinner buffet and Asian restaurant (my husband wore nice shorts and closed toe shoes) were both off the lobby in air conditioning. We had to make reservations at breakfast the morning of the night we wanted to eat at the speciality places. Easy to do and no problems getting reservations either time. Pool/Beach: Lovely! The atmosphere surrounding the pool is so full of greenery and foilage, giving it such a intimate atmosphere. Though the loungers are fairly close, it appears that you have somewhat amount of privacy. We always had a papalpa. I did drop my towels off before breakfast, ate and came right to our spot. We relaxed and then head down to the beach and watch the burn off of the clouds every morning. Every morning, it was cloudy and the then the sun would shine. Only 2 days out of the 9 were there, were more than partly cloudy. The first day the surf was smooth and then more and more breezy and rough. In fact the 2nd to the last day we were there a storm hit during the night and took away part of the shoreline and three palm trees! It was so sad to see. I talked to a Riu manager and he said the shore will come back. After watching the surf and the burn off, we go back to the pool. The pool (I thought) was a little small, and the water cool at first but it quickly feels warm as you get use to it. There is a jacuzzi, but it's an extension off the pool so the water is cool. I brought a little MP3 player with a small portable speaker and listen to our music while we relaxed on our loungers. Then the music at the pool would begin and the bar would open (no pool or beachside bar service) and our day of fun would officially begin! By the way, you can get drinks in or out of the pool. The swimup section was always quite full but the same people didn't stay for hours at a time. Entertainment: We only saw one show and it was the dance show. We loved it!!! I can't comment on the other shows. We either went to bed early, sat by the pool and had a couple of drinks in the dark (very nice) or sat in the lobby for a nightcap. If I had to write down some observations and tips they would be these: 1) Bring lots of sunscreen, the stores across the street sell it for $27 (US dollars) a tube! 2) Careful of the floors in the buildings if you are wet, they can be slippery. 3) The glasses are small, bring your Bubba mugs. 4) I didn't see any floats in the pool, brought mine but didn't use it. 5) Bring your MP3 Player with a small portable speaker, you will enjoy your music before the music starts at the pool. 6) Don't lose your hotel key in the ocean like my husband did, it will cost you $20. 7) Put the ceiling fan on at night. I think the air conditioner gets somehow remotely used by the resort because it gets warmer in the room at night. 8) Ask the bartenders for more liquor in your drinks if you need, they gladly will accomodate. 9) Bring a watch with the date (sometimes we lost track). There is a clock, but no calendar in the room. 10) We packed aqua shoes, but never needed them. The beach has no rocks or little pebbles to hurt your feet. 11) The staff works hard! We were left towel sculptures everyday. We tipped a $2 bill each morning and left it on the pillow. We also tipped the bartenders a $2 bill every few rounds. 12) Our minifridge was filled every 3 days instead of 2, but we didn't mind. Call the lobby if this isn't enough. 13) You can use the internet for 20 min. for $3 in an air conditioned room off the lobby. 14) Don't even brush your teeth using the sink water. I tried to mentioned everything that I would have wanted to know. I hope this helps you decide to stay here. You will not be disappointed!", "Date": "June 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Louis", "Title": "\u201cAnother Great Vacation At This Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Finchykins", "ReviewID": "UR16525190", "Content": "This was our fourth stay at the Riu Playacar, and it didn't let us down. Our group of six were greeted warmly and shown immediately to our rooms. While the rooms are beginning to show a bit of wear and tear, they are kept extremely clean. The beds are a little hard, but after a day of fun and sun, I like that. We slept great. We had no problems with theft or any of the like, but then we didn't leave any valuables out. Why tempt? The grounds were amazing, the pools kept very clean. We spent most days at the pool bar, but lounge chairs were plentiful. Speaking of the pool bar, Alex took great care of us. Drinks were plenty strong, and the service was great. Other bartenders and barbacks were equally friendly. We visited other Riu pool bars(the Yucatan, and the Tequila) and felt ours was definately the cleanest. We did meet some great guests at some of the other resorts, so we still had a nice time. The food was everything we remembered and then some. Seriously, if you can't find something good to eat, you have a problem. The options are varied, and everything is kept very fresh. The guacamole is phenominal. We didn't eat at any of the themed restaurants this trip, but have tried them all. Our favorite is Jade, then the Steakhouse, then the Mexican. We were fortunate that on our last night, there were many Oriental offerings at the main buffet, including sushi. It wasn't the best we'd ever had, but good. The service (at breakfast, and at dinner) was very good. We tipped, but we work in the industry, and eveyone works very hard. The entertainment staff was great. We went to several shows, and the Animacion team was friendly, but not pushy when recruiting for activities. If you wanted a more relaxed atmosphere or less crowds, the other side of the pool is definately the answer. The beach has definately been affected by the hurricanes and erosion. The first and second year we went, it was spectacular. Last year was very sad. You couldn't even walk up or down the beach to the other resorts. While the Playacar had one, there were NONE at the other resorts. This visit, it seemed they stole some of the Playacar's to build up the rest of the resorts. Bad for the Playacar, but good for the whole resort community, I suppose. It was still beautiful, just not as much, and a little rocky. We didn't do any excursions this trip but as a collective group, have done the Dolphin Adventure, Xel-Ha, and the Mayan Adventure Tour. Email me if you have any questions. We did go into town (highly reccommended) for a few drinks, and then to a bar/lounge called Alux. It's in a cave, and very cool. We didn't eat there, but it was a neat experience. The service was also very friendly. We took a $5 cab ride into Playa, then a $5 cab ride there, then a $5 cab ride back to the resort. Check it out. One last thing. There is a new management team at the Riu Playacar. This new team is doing a PHENOMENAL job of being on top of things. Over the years, we recognize many of the same employees, and love that continuity. Not sure how the staff feel about being scrutinized, but as an outsider, new management is dong a great job. It has made a noticeable difference. Hope that next year, they haven't gotten too big for us;) Please email me if you have any questions!", "Date": "May 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful beach, Friendly Staff\u201d", "Author": "KSgirl80", "ReviewID": "UR16237684", "Content": "We just returned from 5 days at the Riu Playacar.

This is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. The location is excellent, right on the beach which is beautiful, pure white sand and crystal blue water and a 25 minute walk away or a $5 taxi from the resort centre which has lots of shops, places to eat and bars. The food was gorgeous, really good quality and lots of variety, something for everyone. We ate in the main buffet every night appart from one night when we ate in the Steak House at the hotel. To be honest the buffet was much better so was stuck with that. Everything was really fresh and lots of it - not good if you are watching your weight! The staff are very friendly and efficient and cant do enough for you, they are really good and really look after you. The rooms are spotlessly clean and comfortable, excellent air conditioning, fridge re stocked every 2 days with soft drinks and beer and also a free minibar. Cant say enough good things about it, try a Miami Vice cocktail - fab! What is also good is you can use the other Riu Hotels (appart from the Palace) so you get a bit of variety. You have to eat your evening meal at your own hotel but can use the pool, beach and bars at the others as much as you want. Out of all of them though I think the Riu Playacar is the best. There are lots of beds around the pool and on the beach, never a problem finding one whatever time you go out. You dont need to be up at the crack of dawn to get a bed. Sometimes the evening entertainment wasnt great but that didnt really matter, some of the shows were really good. I noticed a lot of people have commented on trip advisor about the sand bags on the beach, yes they are there but the beach is still amazing and if you walk along it away from the hotels at the end there is a long stretch where there are no sand bags at all, it is beautiful. The weather was really hot and sunny for the full 2 weeks we were there. Cant really add any more than that but GO - you will love it!

So rest assured we are well versed in Mexico vacations and I know what I am talking about. We even got married in Mexico 2 years ago because we love it so much. The Riu Playacar was delightful in it's initimate atmosphere and truly adoring staff. It's only 300 rooms so it is simple and relaxing. Here is a rundown of our experience: Beach--one of the best so far. The water was a bit rough at times but there was no seaweed as found a bit further north in the Riviera Maya. Small but beautiful. No problems finding chairs at any time of the day. Pool--great fun! Lots of fellow travelers and a great place to meet people. Pool activities were also entertaining and the activities crew was hilarious. No problems finding chairs or shade. Restaurants/Food--I would classify as better than ok but not excellent. The buffet was good and an excellent variety. The reservation process was sort of a pain as you could only make reservations that day for the evening and there are only 2 times available (645 and 845) but it was never booked. The Asian was the only thing I would classify as not good. The Steakhouse was very good and the Mexican was my favorite. Staff--always friendly and helpful and extremely hardworking. Please tip your bartender and cleaning lady. Rooms--yes, the beds were hard--as we have found in every hotel we stayed at in Mexico except for Secrets Excellence (now just Excellence Club, I believe). But after a few cocktails or a long day of excursions you get used to it and don't mind so much. Ask for a mattress pad. Can't guarantee you'll get it but they do their best. We were on the 3rd floor and there are no elevators but other than having to get your luggage up and down--it's a great way to work off all the food! Plus it's a very short 3 flights.

Had a terrific time! It was about an hour ride from the airport, and pulling in the entrance, it was clean and well-maintained. Check-in was a breeze, and a room was ready for us even at 11am. We were in Room 3318 - beware there are no elevators! Rooms are average, nothing fancy but comfortable. Beds are hard, but in a good way, I always got a decent nights' sleep on them. Seemed weird to sleep on two separate beds as a couple though, but you adjust. The food there is very good, I enjoyed the buffet and the foods were a little different each day, with the exception of breakfast, it was about the same each morning. Only ate at the SteakHouse but it was awesome, and it was nice to be waited on. Be sure to get up early in the morning to book a restaurant for that evening as they fill up quickly. They pulled out a grill to BBQ on the only day it rained, that food was awesome also. Drinks were plentiful and service was fast most of the time. I'd say the resort was not very crowded, I never had to wait for a chair at the beach or the pool, but the pool was definitely more crowded than the beach. The staff was friendly and tried to get people involved in the activities such as water polo, bingo, ping pong, water aerobics, etc. You would not be bored at this resort. Shows were all good, you can see shows also at the Riu Tequila and the Riu Yucatan. Please take the time to visit both of these other resorts as they are a short walk away. The first night we were there, we had drinks and we were feeling a little tipsy and got pulled onto the stage for a game called \"The Ideal Couple\" OH! Beware if you are not athletic or competitive!!! We did some risque games on stage but how funny it must have been- or so it seemed from the photos my parents took! We won in points but lost in audience favorites- boo! But we won neat sun visors from the resort and we have a few bruises from our competitive nature! The only complaint I would have is to listen to your travel agent reps there who are selling you trips. They warned us not to book trips off the beach and to book with them. Well....we had already booked a $35 snorkel trip from the hut at the beach through Scuba Caribe. We told the manager that two of us could not swim, myself and my father, and were assured this was NO PROBLEM. All went fine at first, we were taken to the boat by jet ski. We took a long boat ride to a nice place to snorkel, we were told one hour but when we got there the men said only 45 minutes. They could not speak any English, just a tiny bit. So snorkleing was beautiful, saw many beautiful fish. Upon our return to the resort, we idled and anchored about 100 yards or so out in the ocean, on the other side of the bladders they have set up due to beach erosion. We were told by the two Hispanic operators to \"swim, swim\" and we tried to explain we did not know how and it was too rough and too far. Nonetheless, we were forced to try to swim back. I struggled in the surf until I got cramps in both feet, my husband lost a fin, and my parents' belongings were put into a garbage bag for someone to swim back with. My father nearly drowned. He was hit by wave after wave until he gave up and could swim no more. He was thrown on and off the bladders in the ocean. His glasses were broken too. Finally a nice Mexican man swam out and retrieved him. What a horrifying experience. I do NOT recommend anyone book a trip from Scuba Caribe unless you are a good swimmer, or unless you clarify beforehand the specifics of your trip. After much complaining we were refunded our money and sent to a nearby resort for a complimentary massage, so yes in the end we were compensated. I'd like to say this swim shop is not owned or operated by Riu Resorts, they rent space to these people. This was through no fault of our resort that this happened. All in all though, the trip was awesome and the resort nice. Take the time to see the other resorts, go into town to shop, and take the 40 minute ferry ride to Cozumel for the day- it is only $22 round-trip and worth every penny to do so!", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLovely staff\u201d", "Author": "sunseeker018", "ReviewID": "UR15143319", "Content": "We stayed at the Riu Playacar from April 11 th to the 18th.

We stayed at the RIU Playacar. It's easy to see why RIU has a 5 star reputation. Upon arrival on the bus, the resort grounds were spotless. Once inside one had to be awed by the marble and the graphics painted on the ceilings. The furniture was inviting looking and the interiors was \"clean as a whistle.\" We arrived at the resort at 10:00 as,m,; our rooms were ready. We were promptly taken to our rooms, we changed quickly and went for a short walk before lunch. The rooms were clean, practical, we had a liquor dispenser in the room and a well stocked mini fridge. There was a large area with a walk-in closet; sink and the shower and a separate bathroom The food was amazing, you could not go hungry, something for everyone. All meals the rest of our stay were like that; if you went hungry you are just to finicky. The bed was very comfortable, 2 double beds pushed together, gave a good nights sleep. The staff; what can I say about the staff? They were fantastic, couldn't do enough for for the guests. Very friendly, courteous, helpful. There English was pretty good, and if you tried to speak Spanish the were helpful if you weren't sure or using word incorrectly. The animation team worked tirelessly to get people involved in sports & games. Management was was top of the line. The staff were happy in there work, doing little extra things for the guests which equals effective management. There are only 2 bad things about the whole trip 1) we only stayed one week, we should have stayed 2 weeks. (we'll know better next trip) 2) We read some of the reviews on RIU Playacar which made us wonder if we were going to the right place. But after being there the people with the negative reviews ie beds hard, not enough food or variety, staff was surly I say to these people stay home you shouldn't be traveling. To all my friend Wim Bracke, Jay Jay, Susie, Alexandra, Dalberto, Anne, Aldo, Claudia, Gilberto, Polito, Frankie, KiKe, Luis, Miguel and the hundreds of other staff we didn't meet.

We didn't appreciate this and know that the hotel wants to fill the rooms, money is money, but they need to not advertise that they don't allow spring breakers if they are going to allow them.

The first couple of days were extremely windy and subsequently there were huge waves and little beach area to enjoy. Later in the week it calmed down a bit and there was adequate beach to relax in the sun. Overall, the resort was enjoyable. No problem at check-in. Do be aware that there are no elevators in the three story buildings so if you have difficulty with steps, request a first floor room. Yes the rooms are dated but were kept very clean throughout our stay. We did notice some mosquitos in the room during the week. The buffet restaurant was very good. There were a couple of nights that were exceptional and others just OK, but that can be related to personal preference, I'm sure. We did not try the specialty restaurants. Funny thing happened when we did make a reservation for the Mexican restaurant and showed up at the correct time. They said that there had been a mistake and that the Mexican restaurant was closed for the night because the buffet had a Mexican theme night going on. Since we were wanting this type of food anyway it worked out just fine. The buffet was great that night. We did enjoy using the exchange privileges with Riu Yucatan for lunch one day and that was very good also. Breakfasts were excellent. Service was always great whether at restaurants or at the bars. No problem there at all, even during the busiest times. The pool area is beautiful. There was nearly always a chair to be had and you could find shade if you wanted. The plants and flowers around the pool were immaculate. This is one of the prettiest pool areas we have enjoyed. But yes, people do reserve chairs early by leaving towels etc, and some never show up until very late in the day! Pretty good martinis but not always consistent, even from the same bar. Other drinks were also inconsistent, but usually exceptable. Wonder if this was an ongoing problem as we saw lots of drink glasses nearly full just left to waste. Although the rooms could use a bit of updating, we enjoyed the resort overall. The smaller size was a plus. I would return again, although there are many other resorts in the area that I would also like to try. The only other Riu we had experienced was a Palace and there is definitely a difference.

I also have a nut allergy and they were super curteous and willing to cook me anything I wanted to avoid any nut contact. I didn't feel that was necessary and found things to eat.

Nice houses to look at along the way as well as Playacar Ruins. We walked during the day and night and we felt safe at night. Lots of traffic and other walkers along the way. When you tire of the resort food, there's tons of choices in town. I will say the Riu Playacar has the best beach by far. The erosion is really sad and a lot of the resorts in town barely have a beach, at least not a nice swimming area. Riu Playacar swimming area was amazing!!! We swam out to the big sandbag and perched for a while, basking in the sun with waves splashing over us. Pure paradise!! No issues with the safe or missing money.

Positives: -The help is EXCELLENT!!! All the employees were very attentive and quick to action and as polite as can be. - The location is wonderful. I walked around a lot of the places in the area and I think this one has the best beach area. The sand, water temperature, current, and activities available are all wonderful. They have many different activities that you can do for free and others,like jet skiing, that are available at a reasonable price. - The food is unbeatable. They have a buffet that is open most of the day and the selection and quality of food is amazing. It was way better than I expected and the best of any place that I have stayed. They also have restaurants(all of which we went to) that you can make reservations for which are also free with your stay and their food and service is also great but I don't know if they are worth doing over the buffet. - The weather was wonderful. There were two days when rain rolled in but it only lasted a few minutes then quit. Negatives: -The beds were as hard as a rock. There was a Walmart very close (less than $5 cab ride) where you could get the egg carton padding to help solve this problem. -This one is really picky, but the only beer that you could get for free is Corona. -The only big problem that I had was the shower temperatures. They were AWFUL! The temperature would not stay constant at all. It would be freezing, then burning hot, then freezing again. If you went at a time when not many other people were showering, the temperature consistency was OK but if you went in the morning or before/after dinner time, it was horrible!", "Date": "February 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort, but beware of sidetrips\u201d", "Author": "MinnesotaMillergirl", "ReviewID": "UR13758396", "Content": "We spent 5 days at RIU Playacar and overall the trip was wonderful.

We asked Oliver several times about the boat and each time he assured us, yes all inclusive, our lunch consisted of 1 sandwich, we saw some chips on the counter and ate those though.

Overall, we were impressed. We had an incredible vacation. Here are some tidbits that I think some may find helpful. The service was fantastic. The employees are all very efficient, friendly, and helpful. We were very impressed with their desire to make our experience a good one. We thought the food was pretty good. It was a little on the greasy/buttery side, but that is to be expected in Mexico! They fry about everything. The staff during lunch and dinner was very helpful. We give the shows mixed reviews. Some were exellent, while others left a lot to be desired. We felt like a couple of the shows were very distasteful (certainly not for kids). Some of the dancing onstage was very suggestive and we felt like we were attending a strip show more than anything else. We were quite disappointed by these shows. We were not forewarned in advance about the risque nature of the shows--thus we ended up walking out of two of them. However, the Mexican themed shows as well as a couple of the other ones were very good. The other negative aspect is the second-hand smoke. You can't sit anywhere at the beach or elsewhere without it affecting you. We estimated that well over half of the visitors were regular smokers. The beach was nice. I don't know how it was before the hurricanes/erosion, but we were pleased with it after reading so many negative reviews. It certainly seemed to be the best beach in the area compared to hotels three up and down from them on the coast. The other hotels had lots of whale bladders without much beach. We didn't walk as far as the Sandos, but we liked the Riu Playacar's beach more than others in the area. The rooms were nice enough for us. We asked for a couple of extra pillows and slept well. The beds were a little hard, but we didn't mind that at all. The maids do a great job every day. I give this hotel a thumbs up, especially because of the accommodating staff. We really enjoyed our stay. A couple of other things--we found it cheaper to book tours in Playa del Carmen at the stands rather than online or at the hotel. We found a Chichen Itza Tour for $40 per person --one that was nearly identical to other similar tours going for $80-$110 at the hotel. Also, we took the collectivo to Tulum which was $3 per person each way--very economical. We also found snorkeling tours in Cozumel to be cheaper buying on the street. Last observation--we would highly recommend getting out and seeing the culture around the area for at least a couple of the days. You can find enough activities at the resort to keep you busy, but we found it good to mix it up by visiting surrounding areas some days and relaxing at the resort on other days. This resort definitely is a great place to stay and makes for a nice base for a Riviera Maya vacation. We enjoyed our stay.

It is located close to town\u2014 $5.00 (US) a carload taxi fare to town or 20 min walk. The Playacar has eight three-story buildings, but no elevators. If you can\u2019t do six flights of stairs, this probably isn\u2019t the ideal resort for you. The reception, restaurants, pool, beach, and rooms are all very clean and nice and they have an excellent beach. The Riu Resorts are like McDonald\u2019s, but not in a negative way. Rather, you know what you are going to get no matter where you are. The food is good to outstanding, the resorts are always clean, and the help is always polite and efficient. We have stayed at five different Riu Resorts, and while they have all been good, the Riu Palaces are the next level up, not only aesthetically, but in many aspects. The help will do anything within reason to make your stay pleasant. Of course, all resorts have a good and bad side, so let me address some observations that I\u2019ve made\u2026 The price of your Riu vacation includes all tips. The people working for Riu make an average of $5.00(US) a day. Because of this, even an extra dollar or two can go a long way. I\u2019ve found that if you want excellent service, all you have to do is tip often, and to anyone who merits it, starting the moment you arrive. The guy that loads and unloads the bus? Tip him; he works very hard and most people ignore him. Tip the bell hop at least a buck a bag. I hear people complaining that their bar and towels aren\u2019t restocked enough. Our housekeepers get $5.00(US) a day from us, and we have always been supplied more than what we need. You want top shelf drinks? Know which bars have them and tip the bartenders. They will remember you. At the specialty restaurants, tip everybody\u2026 when you come back, the service gets better. Hint: Take along a big pile of singles. There is a weird smell. Naturally, it\u2019s the tropics. The environment is much more humid and nothing ever dries out, so don\u2019t worry about it. My room over looks the resort next doors\u2019 kitchen and there is a lot of noise. You know what? Somebody has to get those rooms, so just deal with it. With the patio door closed, you hear very little. Did you travel this far to sit on the balcony? The bed is hard. Yes, and the pillows are too small. Just ask for a couple more pillows and get used to it. Beds in the Palaces are softer. The food is sub-par. If you can\u2019t find something decent to eat at this resort, you should be staying in town and cooking for yourself. The resorts offer a very varied selection of foods, from local to American-style, and you are sure to find something that suits your fancy. If anything, try dining at one of the specialty restaurants that offer more specific entr\u00e9es. All the chairs are taken. If there is a particular chair or spot on the beach that you want, you need to do this. Get up at dawn. Go to the beach and take a morning sunrise picture. On the way there or back, just throw your stuff on a couple of chairs and you\u2019re good to go. Come and go as you see fit. It\u2019s first come, first serve, just like everywhere else. You snooze, you lose. Towel issues. You get a card to get a pool towel, so don\u2019t lose it (or your towel) because it will become a hassle. People like having more than one towel, so keep an eye yours. If you are saving a chair and only use it a tiny bit, it becomes obvious to everyone who is using the pool/beach area and your towel may \u201cdisappear\u201d. Europeans. The people from continental Europe and Russia may seem loud and pushy initially, and may seem to look down their noses at Americans (especially when in large groups), which can be irritating. However, their impressions of Americans are surely similar to the impressions we get of them, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find upon talking to them that many are eager to chit-chat and get to know people from other countries, or even just practice their English. There are many nice Europeans. Weddings. I\u2019ve never set up a wedding at a resort, but have observed a few. The more laid back the wedding is, the better it will turn out. Things move a little slower in the tropics. If you have your ceremony at 1:00 pm on the beach, it will be sweltering hot. Be aware that everyone sun bathing on the beach will be part of your wedding. That includes the 300lb hairy guy in a speedo or the grandma standing there topless. It happens. My advice is to have the ceremony at earlier in the day when the sun is coming up and the beach is almost empty. It will be much cooler, quieter, and private. Riu resorts are a great value and a fun place to spend a week or two to experience a different location and culture while still enjoying the comforts of a hotel-like atmosphere and the luxury of an all-inclusive resort.

They have asked to be included in our yearly stay at Riu Playacar. As always we had a great time and had nothing to complain about once we returned home. Front Desk: Check in went quick and smoothly as well as the check out. The front desk staff was very efficient and we were enjoying the sun in no time. Rooms: No problems with our room. Everything worked in our room and the room was clean. Yes the beds are hard but we were informed that something was available to make the beds softer. My wife likes the hard beds so we did not try it. The fridge in the room was filled every other day with bottled water, soda and beer. The housekeepers were always very friendly and polite. Bars: The resort has 3 bars. One in located in the front lobby and is opend from 9am to 7am (only closed for 2 hours!). Another one, La Cumbia bar, is located next to the theatre/show area. The third bar, our favorite, is the pool bar. This seems to be a favorite, with people waiting for it to open at 10:30am. The bar staff are always enteraining and ready to serve up your favorite drink. It's amazing they are able to keep smiling with the fast pace they must keep. Beach: The ocean keeps cutting away at the beach, but the beach in front of the Riu Playacar is one of the better ones in the surrounding area. Food: Breakfast buffet is served in the main dining area, our favorite is the omelets. Be sure to try a smoothie. Lunch is served in the open air restaurant close to the beach. There is a salad bar and numerous hot food items along with dessert selections. Dinner buffet is served in the main dining room with open seating from 6:30 to 10pm. There are 3 specialty restaurants which you need to make reservations for. They include the steakhouse and the Mexican restaurants by the theatre and the Asian restuarant next the the main dining room. Enterainment: The entertainment staff starts mid morning and finishes their day after the evening show. They host a variety of activities throughout the day which include; morning stretching, water aerobics, air riffle shooting, darts, boce ball, water polo, beach volleyball, Spanish lessons and bingo. Staff: The entire staff of the resort all seem to have a good attitude and enjoy their jobs. The management team of the Riu Playacar need to be commended for the excellent job they are doing.

They all farm transfers out to whoever, for us it was Gray Line for the ride to the resort, and some no name for the ride back to the airport. Even more exclusive resorts than Playacar do the same as their guests were on the shuttle vans with us. Get something recommended by those who know, read the thread. As for the resort itself, the staff was for the most part excellent. The meals are nothing special, we would have liked some good Mexican food. We got some as soon as we got back to Atlanta, (just kidding, we had some downtown), but there was very little at the resort. We had Thai one night, yuk!, but duh, what were we doing eating Thai in Mexicao anyway. Seafood was VERY limited. That didn't bother me so much, but my kin had a hankerin for some. There is plenty of variety, you certainly won't go hungry. Yeah, the beds are hard as a rock, the rooms are musty. Our toilet was slow to go down, and there was a leak in our ceiling; they offered to move us but we weren't there for the room. There are no elevators, avoid the upper floors if you have a problem with that. Our room on the backside of building 5 faced a big chow hall on an adjacent property. Trucks carrying water, food, garbage, etc were constantly beeping while backing in all hours of the day and night, slamming doors, etc. Most of the time when we heard them it was time to get up and get a Bloody Mary anyway. The beach is adequate, but don't expect any long walks, you can't get past the property on either side. The long sandy picture depicted on their PDF brochure is no more, it has been eaten by mother nature. If you want to hang out on a more interesting beach, go downtown. A long beautiful sandy beach follows along 5th avenue, the strip where all tha action is. If we go again, we won't be staying at an all inclusive, we will stay in a motel in Playa.

So much so that my girlfriend was getting rather irate at all my nay saying before we got there. Once we got there though I realized it was much better than I expected, and I can't see how people wrote such horrible reviews. We had an amazing time at the Riu. Yes, the beds are hard as rocks, but if you request a mattress pad when you check in it should be fine. Besides, odds are that you'll be so tired by the end of the day that you won't notice anyway. The breakfast was great and the lunch was fine but with any buffet you get tired of the same food every day. We ate most of our dinners in downtown Playa so I can't give an honest review of the specialty restaurants. The beach was nice, but as most others have reported, if you don't get there early to reserve a spot you'll have a hard time finding one later in the day. Yes, there are a lot of Europeans but that was good for us, we like to get exposed to other cultures. Some other reviewers said they were treated rudely, but as long as you don't act like the \"ugly American\" (ie: loud and pushy) it's not a problem. We were embarrassed by how some of the other American tourists were acting at the swim up bar but we just ignored them. The rooms are not the most sound resistant because of the tile floors so it will start to get noisy around 7:30-8am when other people start heading out for the day. We were usually up by then anyway. The entertainment staff was amazing, Joseph, JJ, Laura, and the others were very energetic and always eager to please. If you see any of them dressed up in a cow outfit it means they got to work late and are hungover so try and take it easy on them! The bartenders were just as amazing, they work their butts off so be sure to tip them occasionally. I saw a lot of people ordering a ton of drinks but not tipping these guys anything. Say hi to Polito at the lobby bar, he's a great guy. So is Aldo at the front desk. Cab rides to downtown Playa are only $5 and you can take a bus to other cities for around $7 so transportation is not a problem. For anyone looking to get out and experience a little adventure I recommend the Alltournative Eco-tours. There are travel agents every morning in the hotel lobby that you can book these through. We went on the tour where you ride in a Una-mog (it's the first generation of Humvee made by Mercededes). The trip consists of a roller-coaster like ride in the Una-mog, followed by swimming in the underground caverns, sea kayaking, and snorkling in the ocean, plus some amazing Mayan food. Highly recommend it!! My only negative comment is about the rooms. Since it is a humid climate, the rooms have a musty smell. Not a big deal but my girlfriend has bad allergies and I think there were a lot of mold spores in the air and she was sneezing and was stuffed up for acouple of days. So if you have allergies start taking Clariton about two days before you get there and you'll be fine. Also, pack lots of sunblock because no matter where you go in Playa, they charge an arm and leg for it.

The Yucatan peninsula has many fascinating relics of Mayan culture; the beaches were gorgeous; the sea was lovely and warm (in January!) and there was some very good snorkelling. We went with Thomson, and elected to take their trips. We had heard that it is much cheaper to arrange them in town, but wanted to be sure the trips would be of a high standard and we've learned to trust Thomson. We didn't regret our decision. The tours were all on luxury coaches, with interesting and informative guides, and lunch was included on their full day trips. We did Chichen Itza, Coba and Tulum and would highly recommend all of them.

The hotel and grounds are very attractively laid out and beautifully kept; spotlessly clean at all times. The hotel is all inclusive. The food is delicious with plenty of variety available pretty much throughout the day, and there's an excellent range of drinks and cocktails at the bars. All the staff were just lovely - so pleasant and helpful and genuinely welcoming. We don't normally bother with hotel activities, but found ourselves drawn in occasionally because the Animacions team made everything so much fun. Top marks to them for energy and commitment way beyond the call of duty. We enjoyed rifle shooting, Spanish lessons, salsa dancing and pool aerobics. Evening entertainment was a mixture of Animacions team and outside entertainers brought in, and was all very good. Particular favourites of ours were the Mariachi band and the Maya show - both absolutely excellent, try not to miss them if you get chance to see them. It's also worth going into Playa del Carmen for at least one or two evenings. There's lots of live music in bars, plus strolling Mariachi bands, and we thought it was much more atmospheric in town at night than during the day.

The two places to eat are the main restaurant(across from lobby) for breakfast and dinner and the open buffet style for lunch) .(You had two sit down dinners that you had to reserve . they had a steakhouse one and a sea food one)they had amazing selection and enjoyed the pasta bar they set up where you could pick what kinda pasta u wanted and they cooked it for you. my favorite part was breakfast they had SOOOOO much to choose. & the ommlette bar was to die for and the fruit smoothie bar was delicious! We went on a snorkling trip. and atv/speedboating excursion, and it was wellll worth it.This is a very nice hotel. the rooms are very well keept and the staff is there the second you need them.", "Date": "January 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quebec City, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort! Excellent service!\u201d", "Author": "Audela", "ReviewID": "UR12570382", "Content": "My friends and I (a couple and single woman) went to The RIU Playacar from the January 7th-12th. We booked last minute through the hotel website and arranged our own airline tickets. Transportation: We took a taxi to get to the hotel which was about 50 minutes away from the airport. We were able to negociate down to 70 US$ for the 3 of us. To get back to the airport was about 45$. Mentally prepare yourself for the Mexican driving...Picture a 2-line racetrack with lots of cars, speed bumps and 140 km/h ride! Check-in/Check-out: Fairly simple and quick. You get room keys, towels cards and a safe key (free of charge). You get a map and some explanations as to where you can go within the RIU complex. Basically, you can go to all RIU's except the 2 Palaces. Rooms: Our room was in Building 5 (one of the two closest to the beach) on the floor level. That was great because it meant no stairs to climp up every time we went back to our rooms. We had a patio with 2 chairs and a small table. The room was OK. Nothing fancy but very clean. 2 double beds. Quite small to sleep as a couple in it. The mattress was hard but that how I prefer it. The pillows were VERY thin and we had no problems getting 1 extra per person. Each room has a small fridge stocked with Pepsi, 7-up, orange crush, bottled Coronas, club soda and 3 large bottles of water. The fridge is restocked every 2 days. Each room has a liquor dispensor (rhum, tequila, vodka and gin). The room has a TV with the major channels (CBS, ABC, NBC, BBC, CNN, etc), a hairdryer and an alarm clock. We found the air conditionning hard to adjust to a comfortable temperature. It was often too cold. We would turn it off and it would quickly get stuffy. Thankfully, the room also had a ceiling fan. The bathroom was great although our shower wasn't draining properly. Nothing we couldn't live with! The grounds: The property is well taken care of. There are lots of beautiful trees! The six buildings all have a different color. There is a main path that takes you from the lobby to the beach and the buildings are located on each side of the path. The restaurants and buffets: There are 2 buffets restaurants. El Porche is located in the lobby which serves breakfast from 7:00 am to 10:00 am and dinner from 18:30-22:00. El Turquesa is located near the beach and pool. It serves a continental breakfast from 10:00-Noon and lunch from noon-16:00. At dinner time, El Turquesa converts into 2 specialty restaurants, the Mexican and the Steakhouse. The Asian restaurant is located in the lobby next to El Porche. We looooved the buffets! They were beautiful, excellent quality and offered something different every night. We tried the Asian restaurant one night (Sushi was great!) only to discover that the next night's theme at the buffet was Asian and got the exact same options as the night before. Bars: There are 3 bars. The pool bar; one side is a swim-up bar with stools in the water, the El Turquesa bar near the beach where you eat lunch and the lobby bar. You can get all kinds of drinks. Local and international. They have a drink menu. Mojitos, daiquiris, differents martinis, bloody marys, rhum and coke, sangria, etc. Pool: Has lots of lounging chairs but you have to get up early to get one. People put towels on them to reserve them. By 8:00 am, a lot of them are already gone. There's lots of shade all around it. The pool is big enough and rarely feels crowded. The water is quite cold. Definately colder than the ocean. Beach: Unfortunately, recent hurricanes wiped beaches away in Playacar. It looks nothing like the pictures you see advertised in the magazines. It's tiny and feels crowded with all the lounging chairs all lined up BUT after walking down the beach and seeing others hotels, I have to say the RIU Playacar is one of the few resorts that's still has a beach. We were very fortunate. The water looks great. We did step on a few rocks in the water but as soon as we were a bit farther out, it was great! Entertainment: We went there to relax, so we didn't really participate in any activities except water aerobics which was hilarious. But there were lots everyday. Rifle shooting, darts, salsa and meregue lessons, water-polo, iron-man, water olympics, ping-pong, yoga, stretching, etc. The entertainment team seemed nice and they left you alone if you weren't interested. We went to 1 evening show and it was entertaining. Excursions: We took to all-inclusive day trip to Xel-Ha and Tulum for about 120$ each. Leave at 7:50 am back around 18:00. Xel-Ha is a beautiful natural lagoon where you can snorkel and do all kinds of stuff. Tulum is a site where you get to see Mayan Ruins. (Beware: if you want to film with a videocamera, you need to pay a federal tax of 3,50 US$). The all-inclusive Xel-Ha trip included transportation, lockers, towels, snorkeling equipment, lifevest, all food and all drinks (including alcoholics). If you want, you can also swin with dolphins for 137$. We loved Xel-Ha and Tulum. We would definately recommend doing both. My friends also went snorkeling to Turtle Bay where they got to see sea turtles and they also snorkeled in cenotes. They were very impressed with their tour. (74$ each, 8:45 am-15:00) Playa Del Carmen: From the resort, you can walk to Playa Del Carmen (30 minutes walk) or take a taxi ( 5$). There's all king of shopping and restaurants even a Subway, McDonald's and Burger King. That's also where you can catch the ferry to Cozumel Island. Overall, we loved our experience in Playacar. We enjoyed RIU Playacar personalized service and attention to details. The food was wonderful and the resort was beautiful.

The food was great and breakfast was my favorite. They have fresh squeezed juices (watermelon, pineapple, strawberry, canteloupe, etc.) and the buffets were varied enough so that you never get bored. The fresh salsas were also out -of -this-world. They have theme restaurants that you have to make reservations for and we tried all three---Steakhouse, Mexican, and Asian. Unfortunately, none of them could compare to the quality of the buffet. Sounds weird but it's true. For example, the roasted duck from the buffet was hand carved and was 10 times better than the one offered at the Asian restaurant. Try the themed restaurants if you must but we found ourselves back at the buffet after going to the themed one. Tip: if you take the earlier reservation at 6:45pm, you can still go to the buffet before they close at 10pm if you didn't like the earlier food. We also loved the all-inclusive bars. We had been excited about the in-room liquor dispensers but the bartenders were so great that there wasn't any point in drinking in our room. All the cocktails we had were really good. Another tip: you can ask for premium brands like Beefeaters or Jim Beam instead of their generic brands. Just tip the bartender a couple bucks and he'll remember to use the good stuff the next time you come up. The bar in the lobby was by far the best. They also had a swim up pool with stools where you can sit in water while you drink. But considering the copious amounts of alcohol being drunk, I figured that would be the most piss-infested area of the pool so I stayed away. While there, we checked out the other Riu properties like Lupita, Tequila, and Yucatan. We were glad we chose the smaller property because it felt a bit more homey. With less rooms, we felt the staff got to know each guest better and we were able to connect with other guests more easily too. When we visited the other places, they were so big (which is great if you like bigger resorts) but didn't have the cozy atmosphere of Playacar.

I originally booked the trip for seven nights and extended my vacation with an additional night. This was my second time staying at a RIU resort and my first stay was at the RIU Jalisco in Riviera Nayarit, four years ago. The ambiance at the RIU Playacar was fantastic and the entire staff at the RIU was very helpful and courteous. Ultimately, a special \u2018Thank you\u2019 goes out to the Animations Team who with their daily activities around the pool made my stay very enjoyable. I very much liked the team\u2019s enthusiasm and the fun they provided each and every day. I also enjoyed the nightly reception the Animations Team provided at 6:30pm with the opening of the dinner time at the Restaurant, El Porche. Each night there was a different theme and a lot of thought was put into the nightly performances. At last, I always looked forward to 9:45pm time when the Animations Team announced their daily winners on stage. I have to say the team made each presentation very special for the winners. Sometimes, birthdays were celebrated in a special way as well. After the nightly 10:00 pm show the Animations members routinely invited people to do the Conga-line which concluded with the RIU song. That truly was one of my favorite things to participate in and I looked forward to it each night. Once again, I am very impressed with my stay at the RIU Playacar and look forward visiting the resort hopefully soon in 2008.

Our family of 4 returned yesterday after a week at the Riu. My husband and I are seasoned travelers and we've stayed in all-inclusives, condos and regular hotels all over the Caribbean, and this was our first visit to Playa del Carmen. Rooms: The good--spacious, clean, separate toilet area, good location, mini bar & fridge. The bad: beds (hard & two separate doubles), view (an access road & wall), noise, mosquitos, theft (my son thinks someone stole $20 from his shorts, which were in his suitcase) and temperature (the air conditioning couldn't keep up with the heat so it was difficult to sleep). Service: The good--Almost everyone was polite and friendly. No complaints except for the maid. Our kids thought she/he didn't like them! Besides the theft, my other son found some of his clothes in the shower, wet and covered with vomit. He was ill one day and he thinks she cleaned up the bathroom with them! I did see a male employee going into a room in the middle of the afternoon and couldn't see a reason for it. He didn't have a cart with towels, beverages or cleaning equipment with him. Hmmm... One day our door was left open after being cleaned. It was a good thing we kept our valuables in the safe. Pool/Beach: The good--the bartenders at the pool bar did a good job keeping people entertained and I can't believe the booze is watered down. All of us had the hangovers to prove it! There are 2 pools, an activity pool with the bar (fun) and relaxing pool. They're nice and cool but not too cold like other places I've been. The beach was one of the nicest in the area due to erosion and the water was warm. The bad--you had to get a chair early (8:00 was typical) or you were stuck with a broken one. If you're a prude you'll hate all the topless girls. Lots of cigarette butts and vendors. No beach bar or service. Food: The good--Everyone liked the food, no complaints. We were there for Thanksgiving and we had turkey and mashed potatoes. Every night was a different theme in the buffet. The steakhouse restaurant was ok and the Oriental was good. We had Mexican night in the buffet so didn't try the Mexican restaurant. No one got sick from the food. The bad--We're from Wisconsin and missed our cold milk and Coke. I just can't drink luke warm milk with my breakfast! Call me picky! The drinks were fine although you have to ask for the brand you want or they'll give you the house brand. Entertainment: The good--we didn't get too involved in the activities but our boys did and had fun. If you win at one of the \"tournaments\" during the day you go on stage at night to get your prize. The show dancers were pretty good. We only went to 3 shows. The bad: the show starts @ 9:45 so that's kind of late and after the show there's nothing to do except drink at the lobby bar. You have to go down the block across the street to the Riu Tequila to the sports bar (they charge for all the games & internet) or disco. We were advised not to go into town at night. Ambiance: The good--it was casual and safe. The bad--WAY too many Europeans. Of course some were nice but the majority were pushy and rude. I have too many examples to write. Before we book another trip we'll check to make sure it's geared towards Americans. We won't be returning to this resort because there are so many more out there.

It was a very beautiful and small resort with in my opinion the best beach of all the resorts in the area. The staff was great, the shows at night were wonderful, rooms were very clean (but need an elevator to the 3rd floor!), but we will not be returning due to the fact that most of the beach in Playa has eroded and it is very hard to walk anywhere down the beach because there is no shore left- it has sandbags/rocks lining it or water is going right up to the hotels. Other travelers have said you could walk the beach as far as you wanted to a few years ago, so we were not expecting the lack of beach. We had a good time at the Riu Playacar, but were a little dissapointed in its '5 Golden Apple' rating. It seemed just like many '4 regular Apple' hotels that I have been at. The specialty restaurants were the only way to go as we felt the buffet for dinner was not good. I was expecting better food for this rating (more seafood, steak, etc.). We have been to a '6 Apple' and WOW what a difference, we were thinking this would just be a step down from that, but that was not quite the case!

All are friendly and very willing to help. A nice touch was the way they encouraged us to use a few words of spanish to greet each other. By the end of two weeks I think we were getting there! The rooms were spacious and comfortable. Like others have said the beds are firm, but we always slept well. We also liked the numerous 'animals' the cleaning staff constructed from the towels each day. We always had clean towels (and face-clothes!) and a stocked mini-bar and had no security problems. The food was also great with something (no many things) for everyone. We tried all 3 of the restaurants and liked them all. However in the end we prefered the buffet for choice and the ability to control portions. It is easy to overeat at the hotel. I had a birthday whilst I was there and although we did not tell anyone I received presents from both the desk staff and the PR Team. Another personal touch. My husband dived with the resident dive centre run by Scuba Caribe and found them very professional, helpful and friendly. We also went on a couple of organised trips which we booked through the hotels resident advisor - much better ythan either Thompson or Grays (based in the small plaza opposite) in terms of advice, personal touches and price. We hired a car from Thrifty - also based in the hotel - and found the service good, the rates competative and the car itself exactly what we wanted. Driving is much slower than at home because of the roads but I would strongly recommend this for a long trip, like going to Chichen Itza rather than choosing an orgainsed coach trip. We stopped off at Valladolid and had a large lunch for 2 plus coffee for 58 pesos (\u00a32.50). A great bargain and a different experinece.W e stayed at the Hacienda Chichen (and would recommend it) so were able to visit Chichen Itza at 8.30am. There were then very few tourists so we were able to appreciate the atmosphere of the site and get some great pictures without lots of people in them. It was nice to leave at about noon when it was getting very hot and filling up fast. Finally I would recommend the sea trek at Xel Ha.

I should have written this sooner! I am surprised to see that there are a fair amount of negative reviews about this resort-I was nervous after I booked the trip, and then read so many reviews here by unhappy guests! (I have been to PDC once before, stayed at the VivaMaya.) We really enjoyed our stay; our beach was one of the nicest in the Playacar resort area (gated area where most of the big resorts/AI are). We walked up and down the beach, and due to the tropical storms, most of the beaches at each property had sand bags, and lots of erosion. The drinks were rather weak, and all the frozen drinks tasted really sugary. But the Corona on tap at all times was great! You can get it whenever you want. And of course the minibar in the room was nice too, along with the liquor dispenser (terrible low grade tequila and other alcohols, but hey, its in room). Our beds were quite hard, but you more or less can deal. Yes, there tends to be a general mustiness, however, in the 3 times I have been to Cancun, and 2 x to PDC, this seems to be something that is just a given in a tropical moist climate. ( The only place I didnt experience that was the Marriott CasaMagna in Cancun, and we could only afford to stay there one night!) Basically, for the price, which is somewhat high but average, this is a nice place. It is not luxury, or high end, but once you have been to a couple of these resorts, and done more research after each trip, you will find the complaints, and raves, to be similar at all places.

But it is very small, the beds are rock hard and they don't like to pass out washcloths for some reason. There were 11 of us on this trip and most of us had to call for a washcloth everyday. We asked for foam mattresses for the bed and received them immediately, but they didn't improve the bed any. The absolute worse thing about this resort were the guests who have no regard for children or people trying to sleep. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN TO SWIM WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING WOMEN RUNNING AROUND TOPLESS AND WITH STRINGS UP THEIR BUTT!! No where! No designated area for them or for us. And when we asked about a place to take our children to swim, we were basically told there was nothing they could do. Iberostar's policy has always been that the women could not go topless at the pool. Only at the beach. So we were able to choose there. Anyway, it made for a long boring vacation for our children. My relatives stayed in a building where the guests made so much racket every night, they didn't get much sleep.

The food- horrible. Worst buffet food I have had at any all inclusive The staff- well we called three times to have an Iron delivered to our room. We finally gave up. It never was brought.

You can walk to the other 2 Riu resorts just down the road. I probably wouldn't stay here again, not because of disappointment in the resort, but because I like to have change each time I go on vacation.

We filed a report with the mgmt, but they responded back after one week, saying we waited to long (the report was done the very next morning but they did not get to it for five days). No apologies, nothing, just a comment saying they did not have money behind the counter to reimburse us. The rooms do not have key cards, so anyone can quickly copy your key and have full access. You won't be able to lock everything. . .they will take shirts, hand cream, etc. After checkout, we were required to put our luggage in the storage room during the afternoon. This is when someone went through everything and took things like jewelry, shirts, handcream, perfume. It was as if they had time to go shopping in the luggage room. They clearly tried all the facial products and left the bag a complete mess.

There also appear to be either BED BUGS or fleas in the beds, I am not sure which. My girlfriend was covered in bites by the end of the trip and we could see the tiny insects all over the sheets.

We found that by the time the shows started(10 pm) , we were too tired to enjoy them after a full day. We would have preferred if they started the kids shows earlier and the adult shows around 9 pm. Xel-Ha- great day. we got the all inclusive package which allowed for food, drinks, everyone enjoyed the day. worth going. Maroma Paradise- big rip off!!!!! a catamaran snorkel adventure is how it was described to us- what a joke! a horrible bus ride from hell to the place, a ride on a cat that was powered, 2 stops a few hundred feet from each other, nice fish, damaged reef from the last hurricane, and then \"snacks\" at the restaurant, which consisted of chips and a small saucer of refried beans and sodas. It was very expensive for 8 of us and compared to other snorkel trips which we have taken all over the Carribean, this was the absolute worst. It took up the whole day for a few hours of fair snorkeling. We couldn't wait to get back ti the hotel to eat and have a few drinks after this turkey of a tour. Overall, this was our first trip to a Riu and we would consider booking with this hotel chain in the future. We all had a great, relaxing time.", "Date": "September 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Ont", "Title": "\u201cPlayacar great as usual from London, Ont\u201d", "Author": "LoulouLondon", "ReviewID": "UR8607741", "Content": "My husband as I just returned from one week at the Riu Playacar from Aug 25 to Sept 1, 2007.

The rooms are extremely clean but the towels and the bedspreads need to be thrown out and new ones purchased. I would use them as rags to wash my floors.

I wasn't surprised by the recomendations made by our concierge, concerning loosing the keys, or towel cards etc. It is a normal practice anywhere to be charged if you loose the keys. We had no problems with the safety box or the doors etc. As for the smell in the rooms some people had complaint about, I have to say it is due to the high humidity, remember the caribbean is 85 to 90% humidity of course, so just turn on the A/C or open up your sliding door/window and the smell will just go away. Sometimes the power will go out but only for a short period of time, but that is part of the experience of been in a different country in a small town, if you don't want that just travel to New york or elsewhere. In the afternoons by our room's window we got serenaded by the most beautiful bird songs you have heard. Tons of birds on the trees will start singing and it was a reminder of the beautiful place we were in. The food at the Hotel was amazing, specially the breakfast and dinner buffet. There was something for everyone, the meat eaters, the vegetarians, the high protein eaters, the high carbohydrate eaters etc etc. There are so many options to go by that I couldn't believe anyone would complain about the food. The selections of fruit and healthy food is amanzing!!!!! The staff at the hotel was great, everyone from the lady that cleaned our room to the waitress and waiters, the bar tenders, etc etc. I can't say much about the animation staff since I spent most of my day sightseeing and wouldn't come back to the hotel until night time to enjoy the buffet. I got to see some of the shows and they were good, very entertainning. Just what you would find in a community college production. My family and I never had any problems of missing items etc as some of the reviews stated, in fact one of us lost his sunglasses at breakfast and one of the waiters kept them and returned them to us later on. I really loved this place, and the Cheff is the sweetest, kindest person ever, he would do his rounds and go greet people at the tables and ask for feed back, one time he prepared something specially for us. The food presentation was beautiful and I enjoyed so much that I am working on a blogsite so that anyone who is curious about the food can see for themselves what is all about and satisfy their curiosity. We also got to meet the general manager of the hotel and she was amazing, very nice and concerned about our stay if we needed anything, if we wanted anything else etc etc. Overall it was great. As for the sunbathers, yes a lot of people go topless, so what? isn't it worst what teens see on the videos etc on television? of course the complaint comes from people from the USA. In Europe is a normal practice to bathe topless on the beach. If you have kids talk to them, eveybody has boobs!!!!!!

Booked through Thomson, we have been very pleased with the resort accomodation, food, service and excursions. We received a welcome drink on check in. The information we received about the hotel was clear and informative. Our room, (in the pink block, by the pool) was very clean and housekeeping attended every day.There were no unpleasnt smells as some reviewers have reported and our towels were perflectly ok! The food was very impressive. A wide choice, fresh - excellent quality. The waiters and waitresses can not do enough for you. They are welcoming, courteous and helpful. The El Porche restaurant can feel a little busy at times but this is a small point. We enjoyed all our meals. The beach is small and has suffered some erosion but this is not a problem.The sea was an amazing colour and warm. The beach has less shade than the pool. The pool is often busy and many people do reserve their sunbeds at 7am then not sit on them until 2pm! If you want shade you need to get down to the pool before 10am. We thought the entertainment was rather repetitive. The entertainers work really hard, but the shows follow the same format with a different theme. The best night was the Michael Jackson Show. We really enjoyed that! One negative point: BEWARE of theft of keys from any bags you leave at the poolside. SEPARATE your safe key from your room key. Room keys have room numbers etched into them so if you lose your key, you could lose stuff from your room. Our friends did whilst we were there.They lost their camera, binoculars, mobile, jewellery they had bought. KEEP your keys with you. Hang them round your neck or round your wrist.This was such a shame they made the mistake of keeping the keys together and they were taken from pool side from a bag.Don't let this put you off the resort. It is amazing. The staff are well trained, polite and hard working people.Just take precautions and lock your stuff away. We would definitley go back to the RIU Playacar.

We were looking to just get away for a relaxing week, and we did get just that. Let me start this review with the background knowledge that we have only stayed at one other all-inclusive resort. Of course, it was a couples-only, and is rated as a 4-5 star hotel. Please keep this in mind while you are reading this review, and put that into perspective... Check-in: We arrived at about 4:30, and were immediately given a room...and a drink! The man at the desk was really making a big deal out of the room he was giving us; I guess it was because it was in the building closest to the beach and pool area. He gave us the key, two towel cards, and a lock for the safe. In addition to this, he explained the restaurants times. A bell-man followed us to our room with our bags. The room: We were in building #5 which (as mentioned earlier) was close to the beach and pool, which was GREAT! There were two double beds pushed together, which we weren't prepared for. The mattresses as others have mentioned were hard. Just to the right of the beds was the bathroom...there was a vanity area a sink, the closet, mini bar area. There was a separate area with a door for the toilet. The shower was like an alcove. It was very dark in there, with no light. It would have been a nice size shower, but the bottom was set up in an odd way. There was about an 8\" lip around the actual area where the water drained. The water drained very slowly, which was a pain after rinsing off at the beach with all the sand collecting at the bottom. The shower head was moveable, but didn't stay in place easily. The water pressure was nice, but the temperature was another story. It seemed that if people next-door or above us were using the sink, toilet, or shower, the temperature would vary from really hot to really cold, without warning. All the rooms had a balcony. The safe was free to use for our stay, but if you lose the key, you had to pay $50. We did not (thank goodness) experience anything being stolen as was mentioned in previous posts. We left the maid $2-3 each day, with a little candle on the last day. Each day (except for 1) we had a towel animal waiting for us on the beds. We noticed that if my husband slept in and the room wasn't made up in the morning, it wouldn't get done until after 4pm when we were often getting showers and getting ready for the night which was inconvenient. One big disappointment was the mini bar area. We were told it would be refilled every two days. Even though we did not use the liquor there (rum, vodka, tequila, and gin), the fridge had 3 bottles of water, 4 bottles of Corona, 2 7ups, 2 Pepsi's, and one orange soda. On our trip, it was only filled on TWO days. On Monday, and again Thursday when we called because it was still empty at 4pm. This was a disappointment because it was nice to have the bottles of water vs. a little cup from the bar areas. The beach: The beach was beautiful when we arrived on Saturday. By Wednesday, the beach had eroded, and was much smaller than when we first got there. The sand bags to the right of our hotel (at another Riu resort) were very exposed. While it was nice to have the area of palm trees at the top of the beach, it would have been nice to also have the palapas right on the beach for the option of shade next to the ocean. The Riu next door had these, but their beach was smaller. The two days we were actually on our beach were Sunday and Wednesday. On these days the water was very choppy which did not make for good off-the-beach snorkeling. I had heard about people bathing topless here, but wasn't prepared for the amount of people whom did this. I would say about 6/10 women we saw were topless. Didn't bother us, but we did notice some children pointing...so it would probably be important to talk to your children about this before you went (explain this practice is acceptable in most countries). Occasionally, there were vendors that would try to sell sunglasses, bracelets, necklaces, but with a simple \"No, gracias\" they would move on. There were plenty of beach chairs, but some were broken and could only be left in the laying down position...check them before you choose one. Each night, they were lined up again. We never had a problem finding a chair here...the pool was another story. The pool: The pool was nice to relax in after a long day at the beach, but have fun trying to find a chair this late. The practice here seemed to be that people would put their towels on the chairs to save them for when they were done at the beach. So, many times, the chairs would go empty until very late in the afternoon. This was a bit frustrating. The pool bar was always so busy. One thing I would have liked to see was that children would not be able to sit at the bar itself. We often didn't even go over because there were children all around, and no where for us to even get a drink. There were two pool areas. It would be nice if one were designated as the \"children\u2019s pool area\" but I can understand why it wasn't done this way. The towel shack is near the pool areas. When you want a towel, you turn in the card...you can get a different towel throughout the day, or even keep them over night, or the whole week. As long as you have the correct amount of towel cards when you check out at the end of the week, you will not be charged $20 per towel. There was music by the pool, and it seemed that many activities were planned to take place there. The restaurants and food: The main buffet was good, but it got old pretty quick. It seemed to have the same food every night for dinner. We liked breakfast here best. We ate at the buffet for 3 nights, and that was PLENTY! This buffet is not open for lunch. The only option for lunch is \"Turquesa\" or the restaurant near the pool/beach. Lunch here was again the same foods each day. After 3pm, you could only get snacks from here. This consisted of popcorn or round nacho chips with melted cheese. It would have been nice if they kept the salsa and guacamole out with the nachos during \"snack time\" for those who don't eat lunch until later. Dinner times didn't open until 6:30 at the buffet. The earliest reservation dinner time was 6:45 for Jade (Asian restaurant), The Mexican restaurant, or the Steakhouse. There were two reservation times, 6:45 or 8:45. The reservations had to be made each morning between 7-10:30. Reservations are to be made inside the buffet restaurant at the drink area (we were NOT told this when we checked-in). Even if I didn't get up there until 9:30, there were plenty of reservations available. We ate at all three of the reservation restaurants. We noticed particularly at Jade the dress code was NOT enforced. It said no shorts allowed...not true. There was a man in his early twenties right in front of us who was admitted that was wearing a t-shirt, shorts, and a hat. This was a little bothersome because we made the effort to pack nicer clothing because of this. We thought it should have been enforced better. This restaurant was a buffet with what was more like Chinese food than anything. There were a few \"sushi\" rolls, but my husband couldn't even bring himself to call it sushi. It was more like the rolls that you buy at a grocery store...imperial crab meat, rice, etc. The Mexican restaurant had a buffet for appetizers like salad and soup, nachos, etc. There were mostly seafood entrees (which I do not eat) so I ended up getting a steak. This disappointed me because I would have liked to have something more \"Mexican\". The steak house was the best of the three reservation restaurants. There was no buffet, and the service was great! Activities/entertainment/service/staff: I believe the activities were the downfall to this resort. When we checked in, we were not given a schedule of activities. There is a chart posted of activities outside the buffet restaurant, but it has NO times listed! By the time we realized other people had a paper schedule with times, we only had two days left of our stay. When we did get the schedule, there were no locations listed! On Wednesday morning, a woman next to me was approached on the beach about \"stretching\" that would take place in five minutes on the beach volleyball court. The woman who was sitting close to me and I walked over to wait for it to begin...and it NEVER did. No one showed up on the beach to do this! Not sure if it ended up taking place somewhere else, but I just went about my day. I was surprised to see how hard the animation team worked, and the long hours. I do have to say, though, that we were never approached by these people to join in. Throughout the week, it seemed that they had their \"favorites\" and only catered to those people. I was disappointed that we were not approached for joining in things since we had no idea where or when they were supposed to be taking place! The nightly shows at La Cumbia were OK. They were different each night, and sometimes a bit \"cheesy\". Don't get me wrong, I know they worked very hard, but we were not impressed. The staff at the restaurants and bars were WONDERFUL! They not only got us drinks at the bar, but entertained us as well! We did not go to any of the other properties of the Riu, so we can't compare to them at all. Services: We were disappointed that there was not a listing of services in the room. If the spa information had been listed somewhere, we may have tried that out. There was no information about this. We would have also liked if there were an \"orientation\" of some type which told of the services, activities, etc. A nice touch would be for the Riu resorts to come together and have a shuttle service from the airport for their guests. Even if it weren't free of charge, I would have paid $20 or something like that instead of the $60 each way from the airport! Check-out: We were scheduled to be picked up at 1:45 for our flight, but had to check-out at 12. By the time we checked out at noon, the luggage holding room was over packed, and there was luggage all over the lobby that people had just left for the day. It is a bit ridiculous that we had to wait in the open-air lobby for almost two hours. There was a \"hospitality room\" which was basically a bathroom that had 2 showers in it if we wanted to use the beach or pool until it was time to leave. It would have been nice for there to be an air conditioned room or area where people who didn't have a lot of time to wait to hang out. By the time the shuttle arrived for us, we felt like we needed another shower before we even got on the plane. When we did check out at 12, the man took our key, safe lock, and towel cards. He did not say \"I hope you had a nice stay,\" \"Thank you,\" \"Have a nice trip,\" NOTHING! He just waved his hand at us as if to say we were checked out and we could leave. The front desk is the only area that we did not receive good service. I am sorry this turned out to be so long...I had not planned it to be. But, I hope this helps some of you before you go here.

This was our third visit to RIU Playacar in three years and each year gets better and better!!!!!! First off the location is really great. there is a shopping plaza across the street and you are a short cab ride from playa del carmen for more shopping. Room: We had a fantastic Room! We called alex at the main desk a few days in advance to request a ground floor room near the beach and facing the main walkway. Our room was clean by 9 in the morning each day we were there. We tipped the maid a dollar or two every day and we got more towels and towel art in return. Beach: The beach isn't the biggest but it's definitely the best of the other hotels beaches in that area. Apparently, storms were causing erosion and sandbags had to be put in to build the beach back up. There are no sandbags as you go into the ocean at Riu, but there is a large one on the right side of the beach. You can walk around the sandbag if you want to walk the beach. Pool: We didn't spend a lot of time at the pool, we prefer the beach. The pool is kept very clean and has a pool bar. The pool bar was fairly busy but we didn't have to wait long for our drinks. There are technically two pools, but it's really one pool separated by a bridge. Water volleyball and free scuba lessons are held in the smaller pool. Food: The food is great. There is one buffet and 3 other restaurants: Mexican, Asian, and a steakhouse. We weren't very fond of the Mexican but the Asian and Steakhouse were excellent! Our favorite restaurant was the buffet though because they have a wide variety of foods and beautiful decorations every night. Fernando was our waiter at the buffet and he is the best! He would always greet us by name and had our table reserved for us every night with our sodas already on the table. Make sure to sit near table 115 for Fernando, he truly is a great person and loves the guests. Breakfast was always great. there was all different sorts of foods (fruits, cereal, potatoes, pancakes, french toast, quesadillas, and eggs, TONS AND TONS OF EGGS) The peanut butter at breakfast is to die for! It was some of the best peanut butter me and my dad ever had!!! Entertainment: Words can't describe the entertainment staff, outstanding is an understatement. They sweat their butts off for 14 hours a day and will do anything to keep you entertained. There are games throughout the day and the winners get a prize a 9:45 in the show theater. It's almost impossible to not become attached to these guys. The shows at ten are amazing. The dancing is terrific and the guys are hilarious, they really interact with the audience. One night my mom and I were picked to go on stage and dance with the guys, i don't know how they can stay up there for hours at a time, me and my mom were sweating buckets, and were were only up there for 15 minutes! It's really hard to not become attached to them, and they're all sad to see you go. But we'll hopefully be back to see Domingo, Travis, Caesar, Isreal, and Osmar again next year!

So excited to continue on with the day we went to the beach, which was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!!! Clear water, nice smooth waves, and lots of beach chairs. After swimming a little we took some of the best naps of our lives on beach! The pool was great and I loved the swim-up bar and pool activities (don\u2019t worry for you who are not too thrilled about all the pool activity and music, there is another pool which is usually almost empty and quite). The staff, but especially the entertainment staff, is F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C!!!!! Nice, hard working, and are glade to be doing their job. The evening performances were so good and funny that I was sad when they ended and couldn\u2019t wait for the next nights show. One day we went of the resort to see the Myan ruins which was easy to get too because tour buses are just across the street with great drivers and many people on the bus. Also if you cross the street there is a market everyday and a few small stores. The staff is so talented and speak so many languages, yet knowing a few fraises like please, thanks, hi, and bye in Spanish might help you for the few people who speak only Spanish. But trust me you will not have to worry about communicating. The jet skiing at the beach was very fun but you have to pay some money. We never got to parcel but I hear it was great. May I suggest that your bring a deck of cards because it is a really fun activity to do during times when you don\u2019t know what to do, like after dinner at the theater before the show, when everything is closed. Opps I forgot to mention the all inclusive part is great because you can eat whenever you want with unlimited great food. When our stay was over I was so sad and couldn\u2019t stop looking behind me as we drove from the resort to the airport. In other words I had the best vacation ever and want to go back!", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cA review on the the good, the bad and the weather!\u201d", "Author": "CT07", "ReviewID": "UR8106173", "Content": "We stayed at the Riu Playacar for our 2 wk Honeymoon at the end of June into the beginning of July 07 and we would rate it as a 4* hotel. Overall the Riu Playacar was very nice. It was clean and the food was very good (although by the 2nd week you may have to be a bit \"creative\" with what you're putting on your plate) and the staff couldn't do enough for you! A special mention has to be given to the cleaner we had! Every time we entered our room after a lazy day on the beach we'd have a creature on our bed made entirely of towels - like swans, armadillos, teddy bears, dinosaurs! So funny and a really nice touch. There is also good entertainment staff at the Playacar. Being Honeymooners we weren\u2019t into the organised games and events etc, but the staff don't badger you to join in and left you to yourself. We liked that, as at some hotels you can be hounded to join in! My only gripe about the place is if you are unlucky to have noisy neighbours like we did! Unfortunately sound amplifies in the apartment blocks themselves and the doors are rather thin!!! Also if your neighbour smokes then you can end up smelling it in your toilet which is a little unpleasant\u2026 The Weather - was great! It was the beginning of their rainy season, but we only had 2 days of rain out of the 2 weeks we were there. Apart from that it was sun, sun, sun (with a little cloud hiding it every now and again). Also worth noting is that it does cool down a bit in the evening (by the sea) which we found quite nice! Playa Del Carmen itself was, I'm sorry to say, totally charm less!!! I'm glad that we were \"cocooned\" by the all inclusive Riu as Playa had nothing there to endear it to us! I would definitely use a Riu hotel again, but we weren't enamoured by Mexico as a country (which was disappointing for our honeymoon) so maybe we'll try another destination... PS: Those travelling from the UK - TAKE NOTE!!!! When leaving the UK most travel operators let you leave without having to pay excess baggage if you are over by a small amount. However you'll get stung on the return! We were over by just under 5kgs between us and we had to pay about \u00a350 (1kg=\u00a310)!!! You also need to have CASH for your departure tax. We ended up paying \u00a350 excess and \u00a350 tax just to leave the country - it was a bit of a nasty surprise!", "Date": "July 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Flagstaff, AZ", "Title": "\u201cGood time and service at Riu Playacar\u201d", "Author": "taupo95", "ReviewID": "UR8097541", "Content": "We stayed at the Riu Playacar June 29-July 4, 2007. We had a great time and loved how friendly all of the staff were. I will agree that it would have been nice to have more wait staff to serve drinks, but this didn't diminish our experience too much since this was our first all-inclusive vacation. We had similar problems as another reviewer about housekeeping: one day our room was cleaned and all towels removed but not replaced, our water wasn't replaced daily as they said it would be (in fact one day they removed our lone bottle of water we'd left in the fridge), and one day we came back to our rooms to find we had no doorknobs on our doors. While it was annoying to have to call to get these issues resolved, each was resolved quickly and with apologies. One thing we would HIGHLY recommend is the Lomas/Funjet travel assistance group. We booked a shuttle with them for transport between the airport and the resort, then found out they have an on-call representative stationed at the Riu Playacar to assist with booking tours and giving information on local sites. We had Omar and he was wonderful. Extremely informative and seemed to have our best interests at heart. To top it off, he told us to talk to him first if we had issues with the hotel and every time he saw us he would ask how things were going and if we were enjoying our stay. When we mentioned to him some of the above issues, he jumped right on them and the hotel staff really got moving to fix everything. Other issues we had included the minibar - it's stocked only every other day and they give you items that don't exactly mix with the liquor they put in your room (national brand tequila, gin, rum, vodka). The following is what was provided in the fridge: 4 Coronas, 2 Pepsis, 2 orange sodas, 2 club sodas, 3 large bottles of water. The water is supposed to be replenished daily but ours wasn't always replaced (in fact one day they removed the one bottle we had left in there). You could get other safe water at every bar and restaurant, so we often ended up taking our empty bottles to the bar to refill them. Also we emptied our already near empty vodka dispenser on day 2 and it was never replaced, nor was our friends' liqour dispenser replenished in their room. We had no issues with theft as desribed in other reviews, but having read those reviews, we took luggage locks with us and locked up most of our stuff in our luggage every day. The issue with the doorknobs was just plain weird. We were told there was a problem with the locking mechanisms and they had to remove them for maintenance, but we had not had trouble with them at all. Of most concern is that they didn't tell us they would need to be working on them - they just came and took them, leaving us with no way to get into our rooms until we figured out you could stick any long slender object into the door and unlatch it, so anyone could have gotten into our rooms. We went to the other resorts in the area and were pleased to find we had picked the right sized resort for us. Riu Playacar is relatively small compared to the other Riu's but our beach seemed to be one of the most expansive in the area. It was not very crowded and the only time we had to wait for a drink was at the pool bar (which did have a lot of children sitting at the bar, making it difficult to even order drinks there). The food was delicious and we highly recommend the Mexican restaurant. Breakfast was always great and we had the same wonderful waitress every morning. They love children there and dote them with attention, so if you're traveling with kids this is a great place to go. Overall our experience was positive and we would return in a heartbeat.

For the price, all inclusive, you can't really beat it. My biggest complaint would be the beds, the mattresses are extremely hard. If you can get past the hard beds its a good deal and a lot of fun.

We never stay at the same resort, just because we like to try new places. I just like to say that so you know that I do have something to base our stay on. Upon arrival our check-in was smooth and quick. There was no line, nor did I ever see a line at the reception desk. We arrived well before check-in time but our rooms were ready and available. We booked with another couple and our rooms were side by side, just as we had requested. Something I really liked at this resort was the way when you book two rooms there is an outside door that opens into the center of the building and then each room has a door, so if you want to close the outside door and leave the two individual doors open you can. We didn't bring our kids this trip but thought that would be great when bringing them. The walls were also very quiet. At night we heard no outside noises at all. The staff at this resort is wonderful all the way from the cleaning staff to the entertainment staff. Our room was kept very clean and well stocked of drinks and towels. Everyone that worked there was very friendly and always spoke to you and smiled and seemed truly happy. The buffet is wonderful! We ate at the buffet every meal that we ate there except one time, which we ate at Jade, the Asian restaurant. As was typical, Jade was just as wonderful. The entertainment staff worked extremely hard to keep you having fun. I personally normally steer clear of getting all involved in the games and everything but they are so personable that you become friendly with them and enjoy playing all the games with them. There are three bars on the grounds. I don't know the exact hours but the lobby bar stays open almost 24 hours. It's crazy! Their drinks are very good and they are very attentive about getting your drinks to you quickly. Once again always smiling and joking. Check out was crazy easy. We simply walked up and handed them our room keys and towel cards and they said thanks, hope to see you next year. lol I obviously have nothing bad to say about this resort, it's smaller but very fun and active. We actually met some people that were staying at the Riu Palace and they had come to our resort to use some of the water sports rentals. The beach at the Playacar was much better than at the Palace. They ended up staying at our resort the rest of the day simply because they liked it there more. As we were leaving we heard that from another couple as well. If you prefer the beach/ocean and the pool area then Playacar is for you. Another cool thing about the Riu's is the fact that you can go to any of them to visit, other than the Palace. The Tequila has a really cool sports bar and a cool disco. The Yukatan and the Tequila both have really cool bigger pools but we only went by there to check it out.

Some people are just too spoiled...a little more humility folks:) My wife and I arrived in Cancun on June 2, and it was indeed extremely hot and humid (33C, 100%). The trip to Playa del Carmen took less than 40 minutes. Upon arriving at Riu Playacar we were greeted by an extremely friendly and smiling staff (Robert, speaking Polish, English, Spanish, French and Italian!!). Even though we arrived around 10am, we were given a room and immediate access to all of the hotels amenities. The room was great, although one could not help but notice a slight scent of humidity. No biggie, it's Mexico in June, rainy season with humidity hitting 100% almost everyday. The pool was awesome, cleaned everyday, clean towels whenever you wanted one. The only complain would be that the pool closed at 8pm. The beach is rather small, but that is due to extreme erosion from the Carribean Sea and last years hurricane Wilma which hit the coast pretty hard. The food was great, lots of fresh fruits, salads, good selection of meats. One thing though, the pork chops were dead literally....:) again no biggie, considering the variety of other food available. The restaurants are great although I'd suggest going to buffet dinners since there is a wider selection of dishes. The best we had was the Mexican Night on Friday before leaving. Amazing food, amazing service, tequila, wine, monk fish, taquitos, enchiladas! The staff was amazing, always smiling, always making every effort possible to please, courteous. The night before leaving we had a cleaning guy come in to collect dirty towels, he shook our hand and wished us a great last day and a safe trip back home. Absolutely first class! The guys working at the pools, El grupo de Animacion, were a handful:) Funny guys, always sweating their butts off to make people feel comfy and coming up with things to do. One thing is certain you WILL NOT be bored at Riu Playacar. Again first class! Overall, we had a wonderful time. Nothing bad to say about the hotel or staff.

When we got off the plane the hummididty was realy high and it was over cast, i suddenly remember thinking oh my goodness what is the weather going to be like as we are both sunseekers. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by the receptionists who was very helpfull and quickly explained roughley where everything was. Our rooms were very good and we were both pleasently supprised to see a mini bar and optics on hand in our room, this was all inclusive and was topped up every two days which was brilliant, this included bottles of purrified water bottles of soft drinks and on the optics there was four brands of alchol, excellent, this was emptied very quickly as the larger here is very good. The temperature of the room was lovely and cool, this included air con and an electric ceiling fan which had three different speeds on it, we left them both on for the whole time that we were their. The weather was brilliant lots of sun but at the same time a brilliant breeze. The pool had plenty of sun loungers and the beach was lovely. One of the pools has built in access for a person who is disabled which i thought was a very good idea. Very easy access around the complex for everyone. The only thing that we did not like was having to see the hotels photographer walking around with Parrots and Iguaners so that guests could have photographs with them, you could visibly see that the animals were not enjoying this and was cruel to see, this was ashame to see on our holiday, i suggest that anyone travelling to this hotel stays away from photographs with these poor animals. The food was fantastic we ate like kings, i am normaly very wary of eating chicken, fish and other types of meat but i can honestly say we ate everything that we could try and no problems with a dodgy tummy. The Room Maids were brilliant very pleasent and cleaned the rooms every day. Shopping at 5th avenue is a womans paradise great designer shops, so expect to take plenty of money.

Although I was a little bit skeptical before I left, especially after reading some of the postings, I was pleased to see that I made a very good selection. Having been in the Yucatan Peninsula before, I was not completely surprised by the architecture or comfort, but Playacar is a great destination with really neat architecture. Arriving in Cancun, it\u2019s always a hassle, but this time, choosing Best Day travel as the transportation mode to Playacar area, made our experience more enjoyable especially thanks to our driver, Victor, that gave us good advice and pointed out couple of interesting places to visit during our stay. When you get there, the hotel is located right across the street from the little arts and crafts market, which made it very convenient for the evening stroll and last minute shopping. The architecture is really nice and the lobby is quite charming The staff at Riu Playacar and Robert in particular, have really helped in making our stay so much more enjoyable. The grounds are very well kept, and the beach access is not bad in comparison with other hotels in the area. Rooms are very clean and the minibar is continuously replenished. I would say that the only drawback is the reduced number of restaurants to choose from on the property. A total of three restaurants on the grounds are available during the day, but unfortunately only two open for dinner. One is \u201cEl Porche\u201d, which is absolutely great and the other one is Jade offering Asian cuisine. On top of that you, for Jade you need to make reservation in the morning.

The shower and tap water were a tad on the smelly side (not potable), some of the rooms A/C were not working, and with only one restaraunt (besides the one you need to make reservations for) got repettitive after a few days. For this resort, All inclusive does not mean All inclusive. You must bring cash for internet services, phone, snorkle, skuba, parasailing, etc. And its not cheap. A 10 minute parasail ride costs 35 bucks american per person, just an example. There are tours you can take but again, not cheap. There is only one dinner theatre on the resort which does the same thing every night. After the 3rd night, you are looking for something new to do, which is outside of the resort, and again costing you more money. The thing which suprised me the most was the amount of thieft happening. Our own room was a target. We had clothes, money, and jewlery taken from our room, and when we brought it to the attention of the manager, we were given a bottle of booze. Which didnt make sence anyways since it was an all inclusive resort and the booze was free anyways. We noticed on several occasions that there would be a soft knock on the door and then an employee from the resort would use a key to enter the room. More than once a day also. In all, we had about $200 of missing items, which was exchanged for a $5 dollar bottle of tequilla. We went to this resort for a wedding and we were not the only room out of 10 who had things missing from the rooms. There is a small safe in the room, but not big enough to fit 2 suitcases.

We stayed in Building 1 on the ground floor along the main walk way to the pool. We were worried it would be high traffic, but it was perfectly fine. House cleaning kept our room stocked with towels, shampoo, and left us cute animals made out of towels. They also stocked the mini bar and fridge every other day with drinking water, pop, Corona, liqour, etc. If we ran out before, we just called the front desk and it was delivered right away. Many reviews of this hotel said the beds were hard and the pillows were flat. Our beds were firm, but I still got a good nights sleep and just used 2 pillows which was fine! FOOD - I am always worried about how the food is when I go on vacation because I am the world's most PICKY eater!!! I couldn't get enough and probably gained a few pounds! The buffet was awesome! The food was always fresh and there were numerous options so it never got boring. We ate here every night, but one, That night we ate at the steak housewhere you had to make reservations. It was nothing spectacular. The steak was ok, but was cold by the time we were almost done eating it. We both preferred the buffet. Lunch was available at the Turqueza restaurant by the pool and was also good. They also had a pool party and BBQ by the pool. The waiters and bartenders really work hard to please you. We did tip them at the end our our stay and they were very appreciative. ENTERTAINMENT - The entire RIU staff works so hard to make sure the stay is memorable - they work 6, 10 hour days!!! To start the day, the RIU Animacion (activities group) planned games (rifle shooting, bocce ball, water areobics, volleyball, etc.) which were fun and the winners received prizes. And it also didn't hurt that the guys are extremely good looking!!! They also took the time to get to know the guests (and remember them thoughout the week) - one employee, Israel even had lunch with us. There was also an employee who played with the kids - dress them as pirates (make up and all) and had balloon sword fights, etc. At night, they same staff would take guests on stage to dance and present awards, etc. Again, the kids could do the hokey pokey, play games, etc. At 9:45, the themes show would go on. These were mostly dancing shows - Grease, Latino, International, etc dances. Although it was a little repetitive, the dancers were working thoughout the day to perfect their routines. On Friday night, they had a Mariachi band which was very good. They also had a house band a couple nights where the employees were ask the guests to dance. After the shows, there was open dancing or guest would go to the disco at the RIU Tequila (sister resort) . BEACH - it was a little small because the hurricanes erroded the beach, but it was still beautiful and well maintained. The resort next to the RIU (I believe the Wyndam) didn't have a beach at all!

The food is excellent. we would go back again. But, we only stayed for 2 days bec. we got a upgraded promotional stay to Riu Palace riviera Maya. The riu palace was so nice and elegant but the atmosphere is sure different. We did not feel we were in Mexico ;it`s more like we were in any other western hotels. We miss the riu playacar`s atmosphere bec. you can feel the culture. My daughter wanted to go back there but it`s too late and anyway we may as well enjoy the upscale hotel for such a price.

There was always a chair and your choice of sun or shade. The cleanest place I've ever been, they are always cleaning!!! I spent less time by the pool, there was less of a breeze and they played silly games in the afternoon which isn't something I really enjoy - but it was certainly something many others enjoyed. The staff was incredible. I work in the service industry and it never felt like they were helpful only if you tipped them. In reality they seemed to enjoy there job, whether they got an extra tip or not, and they all deserved extra tips for doing such a good job with a smile everyday! The food was good and lots of variety, and the fresh fruit I am missing now! The rooms are okay, beds are hard but you do get used to them. The shower and bath area is very nice and spacious. The musty smell was gone after the air was cranked and an air fresher was used (plan to bring one). If you want to go on any excursions it's best to go across the street and book with gray line tours, it's cheaper and very well done. Ask for Manuel if you do the Tulum tour, he's fantastic and made the trip wonderful. Don't forget to bring bio-degradable sun screen as many of the excursion require it.

The resort was fully booked eventhough it is now officially low season, but the staff handled everything very efficiently. The only problem that we had was that the door to our room stuck so badly that we couldn't get into it several times. Each time, we'd have to trek down to the desk and have a bellboy come up to open it for us. Finally, after the third time, someone came up and completely replaced the lock for us. After that, it worked fine. The food was just dandy. Some of the stuff was a little greasy, but if you looked around, you could find healthy, fresh, delicious choices. (Try the oatmeal or rice pudding for breakfast. They are made from scratch and wonderful!) We did eat at the steak place one night and it was okay. I personally found the buffet to be just as good and with many more options. Bar service was great! I told the bartender (at the main bar near the stage) the first day there that I am pregnant and can't have liquor. He seemed to take personal pleasure in coming up with new n/a drinks for me and remembered me each night. As for some of the negatives that I've heard on here, yeah, the rooms can be musty and the beds are hard. This is the tropics. It's to be expected. Turn on your a/c for a while and the musty smell should clear right up. The beach is small, but it's always clean and there are plenty of chairs available. One hint for those planning on travelling here: Check out the Gray Line Tours located across the street near the little mall. They are more reasonably priced than the ones that you can get in the hotel lobby and the staff is extremely well-prepared and educated. If you can get on a tour to Tulum with Manuel, I highly recommend it. Really nice kid who knows more about the ruins than I've ever heard before (this was my third trip to Tulum, my sis' first) and he has a great sense of humor that keeps everyone laughing the whole time.

We went down April 8-15th. It was 88-95 everyday. We were all 27-29 year old couples. When we arrived on Sunday we were all welcomed with a drink and wanted to have all our rooms together since there were 3 couples. They put us in 6th building closest to the beach. It is the Pink one. That is the one I would recommend to everyone. Number 5 is close to the beach but we heard people complaining that the busses and workers were loud on that side. We were on the third floor with the high vaulted ceilings. The rooms were not musty and were very clean. The fridge was stocked with beer, pop, and water. There were 4 bottles of booze on the wall. The towels were new and soft. The balcony was inviting and fun to sit on when waiting for all the girls to get ready for dinner. We loved all the restraunts. We never did the asian one though. It was hard to get reservations. So we took turns sending people down at 7 to make them. The pool and the pool bar were great. We spent 4 days on the beach and 3 days at the pool. It was so hot on the pool area you had to be in the shade or in the water. When we first arrived at the beach it was very large and then it started shrinking throughout the week. On the last day it started to come back. There we all sorts of things to do everynight. We went to the other sister hotels each one night and then to 5th one night. It was a 5 dollar cab ride to 5th and well worth it. Our hotel had a show or an event everynight that we all enjoyed. The entertainment staff was great. They always had something going one and made it fun to be there. There is one thing that I would recommed. We got large insulated mugs to get our beer and drinks in before we left. We got them at walgreens and everyone wanted to know where we got them. The cups they give you drinks in were small and did not get them cold for very long. The only complaint we had was no room service in that I mean no meals.

We all had a great time. The resort was beautiful and the staff was outstanding. We were there April 3-8. The beach was my main concern before traveling. If you have already booked and are concerned, relax! Right now the beach certainly is not as big as the resort pictures indicate and it is not as big as some to the south, but it is very nice. As you sit in your chair, you will have a wonderful view. You can, though, see big black sandbags in the water at each resort to the left and right, but you have to look for them. They are not distracting. No sandbags in the water at our resort. The two levels of beach reminded me of natural sandunes beaches . Actually quite natural looking instead of sculpted. Of course the beach can change daily! We walked the beach twice to the south. The walk was a little challenging in parts (we had to walk on the upper level of the RIU Mexico beach) but got easier as we went on. The assistant manager came around twice during dinner to see how our trip was going. We couldn't think of anything to complain about when we saw her. We had six rooms total. Three had no musty odor,. Two had a slight odor that decreased as time went on. One room was way; too strong and we had to contact the resort. Now I understand why there were varying reports on this forum concerning the musty smells - the rooms varied . We felt that the musty smell factor may have been due to how little the guests before us used the air, how long the room stayed closed up, where the room was located, etc. I would recommend contacting the resort if you feel that your room is going to really bother you. On the room towel subject. I think they got new ones. Ours were fluffy brown towels that looked very new. I believe another poster reported the change during their stay. The thin beach towels didn't bother me. Beds were firm but were on boxsprings. We were in Mexico. We slept fine. I was the mom in charge of finding a reasonable but beautiful resort to accomodate different families. The rooms needed to be clean but not luxurious.

We traveled with another couple and here is what we think: Pools - crowded as was expected but we were always able to get chairs. The pool bar was never too long of a wait. Two of our travelers took scuba lessons in the pool and saw things like toilet paper floating around so there wasn't much swimming on our parts after that. Beach: Always could get a chair - lots of choice for shade or sun. Lots of beach on the \"upper\" part, not so much on the lower part of the beach, but who cares? We enjoyed that area very much. Food: The buffet was fabulous. We quickly found favorite smoothies, desserts and main dishes each day that we came back for the next day. We ate at all three restaraunts. They were all booked by 7:30 or earlier each morning, so you had to get up early for a reservation. Still, portions were smaller and the menu was limited and the same all week. We sometimes had dessert at the buffet afterwards. Overall, we were very happy. Room: Whoever complained about the towels was a little petty perhaps. Our room towels were abundant, fluffy and large in size. The pool towels were a little well worn, but again large and served thier purpose. No musty smell for us, though we sure were looking hard for problems after reading other reviews. The only complaint was our TV didn't work, we called the front desk and someone was \"coming right up\" to look at it. No one ever came. We finally got that working then the remote didn't work - same problem reporting to the front desk and no one ever came so we just forgot about it. Trips - We took the city bus to Tulum for $3.50. The bus on the way there was air conditioned with a movie playing. On the way back, no air, windows didn't open and flying pests, but we survived. We rented scooters on Cozumel - very fun!!! The ferry was very rocky and they were passing out puke bags. On the way back we rode on top in the back and it was much better. Downfalls: The fitness room was at the Yucatan so we had to walk there. It was small with only a handful of machines and was packed uless you went mid afternoon. The disco at the Tequila smelled like sweat and puke and was filled with spring breakers who looked like their major in college was pole dancing. A plus for the guys in our group, not so much for the wives. Hints: The town was a $5 cab ride or a 30 minute walk. The \"booths\" towards the ferry dock had cheaper necklaces, knick knacks etc than the first ones towards town.

The \"common thread\" through most of the reviews was a musty smell in the rooms and very hard beds. Let me begin MY review by saying that this was probably the cleanest hotel we have ever stayed in. True, there was a musty smell in the room but the climate is very humid and the resort is right on the beach so with all of that dampness, I doubt that this could be totally avoided. As for the hard beds, that is also true. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable they were. I have had lower back problems for many years and my back did not bother me at all while we were in Mexico, which is rare. This would be a strictly personal experience, since everyone has their own comfort levels. The one problem we encountered was spring-breakers. The first night there, around 2:00 a.m., the occupants of the adjoining room came back from partying. They were laughing and talking loudly, slamming the door, etc. I was willing to wait it out for a bit to see if they settled down but they then turned ont he TV (very loud) so I called the front desk to advise them of the situation. Within 5 minutes, security came and talked to the people and there wasn't another sound from them. Two nights later it started before midnight (a completely different group of \"kids\"). They were all over the resort, coming and going at intervals until around 5:30 a.m. My husband spoke to them twice to ask them to be quiet but they didn't speak English and either didn't understand or didn't care. We spoke to the front desk the next morning (along with some of the other guests). The manager got involved and by later that afternoon, the room was vacant. After that, we had very quiet nights. Other comments included the lack of beaches. The entire area had been heavily damaged by hurricanes so the beaches have been eroded. However, they were very clean and usable. We tend to be busy with other activities and don't spend all day every day at the beach or pool so this was not a big issue for us. The afternoon pool-side activities were different each day and anyone who wished could get involved. Again, the pool was very clear and clean as was the surrounding area. There was always someone picking up glassware, dishes, etc. and generally keeping the area neat and clean. We ate at the buffet most evenings but did try the 3 sit-down restaurants. Actually, the buffet posed no problem since the variety of food was so large and every meal featured something special. Of the 3 sit-down restaurants, our preference was the steak house. It was very good but we didn't want to eat there every evening. The Mexican restaurant was o.k. and the Asian was our least favorite, although the food was good. Our overall impression of the Riu Playacar and surrounding areas was excellent. The cleanliness of the entire area was outstanding, the friendliness and helpfulness of everyone from restaurant staff to taxi drivers was helpful and reassuring, the tours were worth the money - informative and enjoyable.

After reading many of the reviews on the property we were well informed on what to expect.

The beds again are really hard, but after a couple nights We were use to them. I would request a room in building five or six closer to the beach. We roomed in the first building on the right, and faced the Resort next door, where all the staff came to work, it was rather noisy all day and night with alot of noise, and buses coming and going dropping off the stafff, along with goods coming in, had to sleep with the door shut at night and still heard alot of noise, the worst was the buses coming in and the back up alarms blaring away when the were leaving. Food: The food was average I would say, Overall it was fresh but you could tell what what fresh and what was not. I wait staff was very friendly and went out of there way to accomadate you. We tried the Steakhouse, Asian, and Mexican resevations as well, they were pretty good however the Steak house was the best. The bar staff was very accomadating, and you always had a drink in your hand. We ate at the Yucatan and the Tequila, It was better food we thought. Beach: The beach was not the greatest, however it was peaceful and had beautiful clean water. We spend alot of our time at the Riu Yucatan Beach, it was much larger and easier to find shade to lounge in. And had better activites to take apart in such as beach volleyball which we really enjoyed. We took the ferry to Cozumel, and it was a rather rough ride but a good experience, We rented a jeep on the island and drove the whole south side of the island and checked out a few beaches, it was pleasurable.

The Mozzie's don't like the cold!! Food - Absolutely fantastic. HUGE choice! Great selection of food, but the best thing for us was the Mexican food! 100% authentic and really, really good!!! I still miss it now! There are a few speciality restaurants, steak, chinese and mexican. We went to the Steak house twice and the steak was beautiful! The chinese was ok, if you like sushi, and fancy a change from Mexican. We didn't even go to the Mexican as you could have it every day in the buffet restaurant! You have to book these but we never had a problem getting in! Pool - we stayed by the quiet pool, the one without the pool bar. This one is much quieter and away from all the activities! The american's and canadians who seem to like to join in with all the activities can get quite loud!! Which is fine if you want to join in, but not if you want to just relax in peace and quiet! There is a towel hut where you can get clean towels from as often as you like. Staff - really friendly and helpful. They are genuine, not like in some other resorts when you know all they are interested in is tip's! Do tip them though, they deserve it. Although you will find the American's and Canadians tip a lot more frequently, but they are used to it! Trips - your tour operaters will try and get youto book trips through them but as we all know they can be expensive. Tip. there is a small shopping complex across from the hotel were they also sell trips. Try there before your welcome meeting,then you can compare prices and know whether you are getting value! We only went on one trip to Chichen Itza. This was fantastic and highly recommended.Make sure you take your camera,some sun cream and money (small notes).There are plenty of locals inside selling their wooden and stone carvings and are EXTREMELY cheap Weather - Great. Only 2cloudy days in 2weeksthere! Some days were unbearably hot, make sure you take plenty of suncream. You can buy it over there but it can be quite expensive! Beach- this was the only dissapointing aspect of our holiday. I was really looking forward to a white beach as described and photographed in most of the Mexico brochures. I felt really let down when on arrival there appeared to be a 6ft drop down to the beach. There has been someseverebeach erosiondueto strongcurrentsand waves following thehurricanes over the past few years.Thereissome beach butnot as muchaswe hadbeen led tobelieve. During the second week the beach waseroded even further, by another 10-20m and 2 rows of palm tree'sfellinto the sea, which Ithoughtwasreallysad tosee.Asquickly as the staff were puttingdown sand bags the beachwas justfalling into the sea! During our second week we juststayed by the pool. Overall a fantastic holiday,didn't want to come back and I would definately recommend it!

And we were used to 5 star hotels here in the states. The food was great we never went hungry. There was enough to drink. Lets face it, if you could find somthing you liked to drink there your to damn picky. And the staff was byond friendly and helpful. They did everything in their power to make you confortable.

Was a little scared about the hotel reading some of the past reviews, but put your mind at ease, you will LOVE the Riu Playacar. We got to the hotel around 2:00 that afternoon and we were greated with a drink and wonderful person at the front desk. This is our 4th all inclusive trip (3 times to the Cancun area and once to the Domenican Republic) and this was the first time we were able to understand the front desk people fully. The staff spoke very good English. We headed to our rooms to get our suits on right away and yes you could smell a musty smell but we turned up the air and turned on the ceiling fan and when we got back later that night we couldn't smell it any more. The food was good. We never had a problem finding something great to eat. We only ate one night at the buffet cause we made reservations everynight at one of the specialty resturants. Our favorite we decided was the Asain, then the steakhouse, and then the Mexican. But all three were good. We went two nights to the Asian and two nights to the steakhouse. Room services was good. Everyday we had a different \"towel art\" figure on our bed. We always had more then plenty towels and shampoo and soap. The activity staff was out of this world. They were full of energy. By the end of the week they knew our names (good or bad I'm not sure). They did everything from pool stretching, to water balloon fights, a beach party, to beer drinking contest, which by the way never go up against a Canadian! They will kick your but! The entertainment at night was okay. If you like to just watch people dance you will love it but if you want entertainment it's not there. We found out when we got back we should of went to the disco at the Riu Tequilla. I guess that is a pretty big party every night. Next time we will know. The only \"bad\" thing on the trip, if I had to write something, was the beach. To get down to the ocean you had to walk down a whole bunch of sandbags. Which wasn't that bad. We did stay at the pool 95% of the week. We talked to the manager of the resort and she said that the goverment was coming in sometime in March to help build the beach back up. So that will be good. As you can tell we enjoyed our trip VERY MUCH and would recommand this to anyone! If you have any questions you can email me at jpiehl@butler-bremer.com Hope this helped.

Each year we have a \"friends and family\" tour with 20-30 of us ranging in age from infants to grandparents. When we booked this year I read plenty of these darn reviews so I feel obligated to write one, they are helpful. Here is our report..............FOR THE MONEY, this place is wonderful. Our highlights include the staff, incredibly great and helpful, top to bottom, housekeeping, kitchen staff, front desk, bar staff, everyone. In past vacations (some worse than others) unless you are tipping you tend to get the cold shoulder or painfully slow service. This place won't disappoint you on the service side. The entertainment staff is particularly friendly, and amusing, don't miss \"the perfect couple show\", hilarious. The food is great. The buffet is incredibly comprehesive and much better than any other facility in this price range that we have stayed at in previous years. I read reviews on moldy smell, no one in our group had any problem with that in their room, as a matter of fact we found the rooms to be quite nice. The mattresses are particulary hard and the pillows flat, I requested some extra blankets and pillows and they arrived quickly, again, the service is great. My wife mentioned about the tattered towels but honestly, perhaps because I am a man, I hadn't noticed this whatsoever, they worked fine for me. The beach did have an erosion problem from the hurricane, we were told. We still spent a lot of time on the beach area, the views are beautiful. With the Riu you can use the facilities at the Riu Yucatan and the Riu Tequila. We spent the day at the Riu Yucatan and went on their beach, it was PACKED everywhere as was the entire resort. This is the first time we had to stand in lines or felt crowded. We were definitely glad to get back to our resort which really didn't seem very crowded compared to our other trips in past years. FYI, a lot of Europeans stay at this resort so there is a lot of topless sunbathing.

Arrival: Excellent greeting by front desk. We were meeting our friends from Toronto and the hotel accomodated us with rooms side by side. Hotel Room: Satisfactory. The bathroom had ants and the towels were old, stained and stringy. The beds were hard and pillows flat. This didn't bother my sleeping as much as the loud music coming from the hotel next door. I did mention this to the front desk and was told this is a common problem, nothing can be done. Beach: The beach has been washed up so there isn't very much beach. We managed to find chairs and stay at our resort. You can walk down to the Riu Yucatan if you want more beach. The water is a beatiful clear blue. Pool: No problem finding chairs and sun anytime of day. The pool bar could get a little loud and was impossible to get a chair in the water, was always busy. Bars: There are three bars, all had excellent service. You must try the Tequila pops. Buffet Restaurants: There is one at the pool/beach for lunch and one near the lobby for Breakfast and Dinner. Both had excellent food and service. There was always plenty of food and variety to choose form. Theme Restaurants: The Asian is a buffet style, we weren't too impressed with the food. The Mexican was really good and glad we tried it. We did not go to the Steak House. Entertainment: Excellent Staff: They work very hard and kept you occupied all day even on the rainy days. Front desk, restaurant, bars and maids all provided great service and attitude. I did find the Riu entertainment staff could be selective to who they wanted to talk to, like the young girls. Overall, I would rate this resort a 3 star, not a 5 star. We have stayed at three Iberostars that were rated 5 stars and have never been disappointed.

Another with a fountain (which was never on). Lots of chairs at both. Closest bathroom was located between the lunch buffet & the lounge bar. BEACH: Massive erosion problem. Lots of area for chairs but difficult to climb down the sandbags to beach. Impossible to walk either North or South of property. The surf was rough the week were there 2-5 foot waves, not enogh for boogie boards but too much to use the kayaks or other water toys. Very strong under tow.

The pool closes at 6:00 & there was no live music or anything to do before or after dinner unless you walk to one of the other Riu's. The show doesn't start until 9:45. BEST EXPERIENCE: TULUM!

In my opinion the Playacar is the better out of the 3 Riu resorts (Tequila, Yucatan, and Playacar). The grounds were beautiful, Pool was nice and good entertainment. Didn't make it to any of the shows, but heard they were good. The food on the buffet was very good. Probably the best buffet in all of the all-inclusive resorts I have stayed at. We ate at two of the reservation restaurants, second seating. I think the buffet was better. The steakhouse fills up by 7:00 am so if you want to eat there you need to be in the dining room before 7:00 to make a reservation. The drinks in the bars were OK. They do serve a few top shelf liquors. Only Corona beer on tap. I've had better Pina Colada's, daquari's and margaritia's. They weren't bad. Just OK. They serve in small glasses, so bring an insulated mug. They do not have room service. All staff were friendly with the exception of the front desk. They were rude. Now my negative opinions of this resort. If you want a good night sleep. Don't go here. The beds are very firm. Riu is a european chain and I heard europeans like firm beds. So all Riu's beds are very firm. I could put up with the firm bed, but the pillows really were bad. Very flat. We complained about them after 3 days and they brought us fluffy pillows. Why wouldn't they have good pillows on our beds in the first place??? There is no mattress pads on the bed. I think that is gross. The sheets have stains and the maid does not change them daily. The towels in the rooms were really...bad. Raggy and dirty. It looks like they just dried them and put them back in the room. The rooms also have mold in the bathrooms. My husband has allergies to mold, so he was congested the whole time we were there. The ventilation system in the room is bad. It does not circulate properly so it does not get the humidity out of the room. So guess what?? Your clothes are always damp and so are your sheets. So if a comfortable bed and clean linens are a must. Don't stay here. If that doesn't concern you. Everything else about this resort was nice. I won't be returning though.

Don't book from hotel lobby, it's more expensive. Also ifyou are trying to decide between the Chi chen itza tour or Coba I would recomment Coba, its half the distance and just as nice.

The staff of the hotel were fantastic with nothing being too much trouble, the waiters we found particularly accommodating. The Hotel itself was clean and the grounds were beautifully maintained. The rooms though were not up to the standard of the rest of the Hotel and were more 3 Star than the 4 stars Thomson rated it or the 5 stars Riu rate it. There was only a shower (no Bath) and a curtain dividing the bathroom from the sleeping area. We had requested adjoning rooms because we took our kids, to find that we were not together on arrival. A quick chat with reception soon sorted this out. Strangley two rooms shared a single passage way which was fine if you shared this with family which meant you could shut he outer door leaving the inner doors open but not so good if you were sharing with strangers. Having said that the food was 5 star with a wide variety of choice and range. The only thing missing was the champagne at breakfast that we are used to having at other 4 star hotels although the free minibar and optics made up for this. The activities and the animation team kept our kids 15,17 & 19 amused on the days we stayed around the Hotel. The only real gripe was the pool itself which we found to be the only area that needed improvement. The pool was constantly dirty with debris which included a range of bugs, plasters and straws floating on the surface and the floor of the pool littered with plastic beakers, sand and sodden leaves. Using the swim up bar was an unpleasant experience because of the amount of dead insects floating around whilst trying to enjoy one of the many cocktails on offer (alcohol was brand names and not cheap local produce appart from the tequilla of course). I reported this initially to the pool guys who then did absolutely nothing about it. I then reported it to the Hotel Management who tried to fob me off with excuses of weather (Winds) etc. I explained that having a pool at home meant the excuses given were not acceptable and that the filter system was simply not up to it. On our last day a concerted effort was made with the pool being properly vaccumed and the tiles washed and and the surface scimmed. However, my feeling is that this was only a small effort made because of my complaint and they would soon lapse back to their previous regime of neglecting the pool. Mexico is fantastic with warm friendly locals and a wealth of history and culture. Mexico is now our favourite holiday destination and it is our intention to return every year and inspite of the niggles we would return to the Riu Playacar whilst we have children. If you have no childrern I would go to the Riu Palace Mexico which we visited during our stay. Other things to consider are the trips on offer. if you are prepared to walk or take a taxi into Playa Del Carmen you get these trips even cheaper than the kiosks outside the hotel can offer, and they are undercutting the hotel and the tour operators by nearly as much as 40%.", "Date": "February 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cwonderful\u201d", "Author": "julestap60", "ReviewID": "UR6804600", "Content": "My husband and I just got back from staying at the Riu Playacar.

Overall, it was an excellent vacation. It was our first trip to Playa and it won't be our last...next year (because we are going back) we will be wiser. Here are some things we learned along the way. I will leave out the stuff everyone writes. I want to cover things I wish I knew before I left. AIRPORT TRANSPO: Don't fall for one of the overpriced \"shuttles\" that advertise on the web like Paradise Transfers. We got taken. Total loss about $40. Get a taxi instead. It's only $50 one way. Or ride the bus. DOLLARS vs. PESOS: Wait until you get there to take out/exchange money. You get more for your money purchasing with pesos. The ATM across from the hotel was easy. We got about $2,000 pesos for $185 - so it's worth it. HOTEL: Beautiful. The rooms are nice but our room was moldy and stinky. We didn't realize until we got home and were sick with coughs that we should have changed rooms. If your room stinks of moisture - change rooms ASAP. HOTEL STAFF: The best. They work very hard and deserve tips. Not everyone tips. We gave $2 or 20 pesos for meals (give directly to them) and tipped our maid daily. STRATEGIC TOWELING: You will need to be strategic when scoping out your spots (sun or shade). Some rude folks drop their towels on chairs at 9 a.m. and leave them there all day without using them. Get your spot early and if you are going to be gone more than 30 minutes, give it to someone else. It's only fair. BEACH: (See attached photo) Don't feed the rumor that the beach is gone. There is plenty of sand and beach - it's just changing daily and there is some sandbagging. There is still plenty to enjoy at this hotel and several others. BRING: Plenty of shorts and tank tops. You need to change way more than you think (this tip mainly for us girls who like to be cute at all times). Lots of sunscreen - one bottle will not go far so bring two. HAIR: Give up on trying to keep it straight. I flat ironed my hair and it was curly two hours later. Work with the weather and pull it back with a clip or scrunchie. GYM: There is an excellent gym you can access at the Riu Yucatan but it's a long walk (which is kind of a power walk workout in itself if it's hot). Go early before the heat. Treadmills, Elliptical and weights provide a decent workout. OUTSIDE RESORT: Go and check out town, Xcaret, Xel Ha, Mayan ruins, etc. but I don\u2019t recommend eating food outside the resort. It\u2019s risky. ALL INCLUSIVE: It's the way to vacation. For us wives and moms, just think you don't have tocook or clean at all. Drinks and food galore. I drank enough to cover my room charge!

Prior to my arrival, I was very concerned about the weather and beach conditions. Here are my quick thoughts on the Playacar experience: Hotel -- The hotel was great. Very nice grounds and the service is exceptional. I stayed in a 2nd floor unit off a stairwell overlooking the garden, and the room was very nice (and not too noisy). The beds are firm (you might bring a pillow if you can), but the room was of high quality. Food -- Food is primarily a buffet setup; as long as you don't expect a fine dining experience, you should be happy. My biggest issue with the dining was not the food itself (I thought all meals were quite good and always fresh) but with my fellow guests (I suggest avoiding the peak lunch time crowd as it reduces your chance of getting cut off or put off by someone with less-than-graceful table manners. Beach -- The beach is essentially cut off at the main ground level, but then extends down a slight slope to the ocean-level beach front. The ground crew was working to add sand bags to make it easy enough to step down to the ocean. The beach was plenty big enough to accommodate people wanting to lay out there. The ocean was great. Pool -- The pool was nice and it was always easy to find a nice spot. The activities coordinators will recruit you hard to join is some fun, but they also know to leave you alone if you'd rather stick with a book. Weather -- Over the course of five days, there were some clouds and rain, but generally, the sun was out for most of each day (clouds tended to roll in around 2-4 p.m. and most of the rain showers lasted only 30 minutes. Overall -- The experience was very good and I will go back again. I walked down to both the Riu Tequila and the Riu Yucatan and these were also nice properties. Next time, I will likely spend one of my \"lounging\" days at the Yucatan to change it up, but really, neither the Yucatan or Tequila seemed a better choice to me.", "Date": "February 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Damascus MD", "Title": "\u201cRiu Playacar was awesome\u201d", "Author": "goingsouthsoon", "ReviewID": "UR6778969", "Content": "The resort was beautiful with well kept grounds, lobby, restaurants and pool area. The price for the flight and resort was excellent. We were hesitant to book it at first but after enjoying ourselves so much after 2 days - we began asking ourselves when we could come back! The only thing we did not care for was the rock hard mattress. The staff layered blankets under the sheets for us and that made it better. After a few days, we didn't even notice it. Our room had a refrigerator with beer, sodas and several large bottles of water. That was great to have on hand and at no extra charge. Staff everywhere was wonderful, from the bartenders to the housekeeping staff. We especially enjoyed the waiters during the dinner. Some of them did tricks with the utensils and glassware. Their sense of humor and service made dinners an event each night. Our resort was one of the few along the strip that still had a beach area. So much of it washes away daily. The entertainment staff was great. Young adults, all good looking and lots of fun. They handled kids and adults very well. There were several shows, one of which was more like a high school musical, but all were fun. The food was very good and we were spoiled with so many choices all day, every day. Some of the desserts had a refrigerator taste but since there were so many to choose from, it was not a problem satifying our sweet tooth.

Overall, food was a little bland but there were ample salsas from mild to hot to add taste. Only ate at the Mexican specialty restaurant which was out standing. Service- Front desk, maids, and bartenders were very attentive. The dinner service at the buffet could be a little slow, and I often had to go get my own drinks rather than wait for them to get me one. Breakfast service was very good. The Bad- Beach- 3 weeks ago there was major beach erosion. Riu Playacar seems to have stabilized the beach, which is only about 10 feet to the water now. The beach is slowly coming back. You are able to use the beach and facilities at the Riu Yucatan, about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The beach at the Yucatan is very nice. Be advised the lunch buffet at the Yucatan was not as good as Playacar. Room- the beds and pillows were both very firm. The sheets and towels were clean, but often had stains on them and they were incredibly rough. We were in a first floor room, and the corridors outside our room were very noisy.

We had reservations for the Riu Tequilla but the Manager there told us there was a pluming problem and only 5 more rooms were available and we would be upgraded to the Playacar. They asked us to go to the bar and have a drink while they printed out a document for us to sign and also took our emergency contact information and told us they would call them and let them know we were changing hotels. I didn\u2019t think they would call our contacts and when we got home we found that they didn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t want a room on the ground floor and asked for a 2nd floor room thinking there were only 2 floors. There are actually 3 floors, the ground floor, the 2nd floor which they called the 1st floor, and the 3rd floor which they called the 2nd. There are no elevators. When we got to are room there was a little difficulty opening the door, to open the door you had to turn the key to the left then while turning the key pull the door knob towards you then the key would turn a little further at which point you had to push the door kind of hard to open it, (because there was a damping mechanism at the top of the door to keep it from slamming shut.) It can be challenging if you are carrying anything or have your hands full. We also noticed that they only gave us one key we later went to the front desk and got another key which barely worked, you had to fiddle with it quite a bit to get it to work, (that\u2019s probably why they didn\u2019t give it to us it the first place). We then went to have lunch, after returning to our room I noticed that the Air Conditioning was not working. I tried calling the front desk a few times by dialing 0 which kept on being busy. Later I realized by reading the Riu booklet in the room that to call the front desk you had to dial 813 or 413 that was after I walked to the front desk to let them know that the A/C working and was told it would be looked right away that was about 4:30pm, no one ever showed up so I called at about 5:45pm, no one still hadn\u2019t shown up so we went to dinner and stopped at the front desk on the way and complained again and was told some one would be there right away it was now 7pm after eating we returned to our room a little after 8pm and there was a guy working on it he worked on it till 10:30pm and said he would back in the morning. The next 2 guys showed up to work on it, we went to the pool/beach and when we returned it was fixed. Our room number was 3307 which is the middle building facing the back of the property to the south of the Playacar, it had a good view of their employees hanging out, coming and going by bus, garbage trucks and what sounded like a car alarm that went of a lot of the time. The bath room had no tub only a shower stall. The shower head was a detachable design with a flexible hose, the best thing was that it was mounted on a vertical bar to raise or lower the height of it, I\u2019m 6\u20192\u201d and usually the shower heads are to low but you could be 7 feet tall and it would still be high enough to stand under. Every day there was a towel animal left on the bed. The mini bar fridge kept the drinks nice and cold, Usually they don\u2019t get cold enough but this one worked great. One thing I didn\u2019t like was that the bottles were glass and the floors are all hard tile if you dropped one there probably would be glass that would need to be cleaned up and with plastic you could drink some recap it and put it back to stay cold. The water bottles were plastic though. One the ground floor there is a ice machine, the one in our building didn\u2019t work the whole time we were there. The building and grounds were always kept very clean all the time. I walked the beach quite a bit and at the Playacar there is some erosion, the beach has 2 levels, the first level is at the water level the second level looks like they had to dump extra sand one it to raise it up, you had to climb up or down a little sand hill to go down to the water or up to the lounge chair area. From the Playacar\u2019s beach you can\u2019t walk north towards PDC, the water comes right up to a wooden wall and the waves hit the wall pretty hard I didn\u2019t see anyone try to go past it. At the other end of playacar\u2019s beach you can get past the sand hill that has been built up by climbing over or walking in the water on the sandbags that are stacked up around the hill. The Riu Yucatan had a much nicer and bigger beach. The food at the restaurants was alright some things were good and some wasn\u2019t, there was a beach cookout one day and that was good There is no drink service by the pool or beach if you want a drink you have to go to the bar and get it. Security was well enforced at the front gate, every time we returned via cab to the resort the cab had to stop at the entrance and you had to show him your wristband, I never seen that done before. Right before checking out I went to wash my hands and there was no hot water after about 10 minutes still no hot water. This seems to be a common problem in Mexico I think it has happened at least 1 time at every hotel I\u2019ve stayed at in Mexico.

We were booked for the Tequila as we stayed there for the past two years but they were overbooked so they moved us to Playacar & told us it was an \"upgrade\".....in my opinion it wasn't. I guess because it was on the beach that is why. As far as food & decor, it is very similar to the Tequila...yep same hard bed but that is not a concern of ours. We ended up hanging at the Tequila & the Yucatan for a day & ate dinner at the Tequila 3 nights because we knew most of the staff at the Tequila from years past. The kids club at the Playacar is nothing like the Tequila. Our daughters had a blast at the Tequila with the program that they had but really not that exciting at the Playacar for them...they did try though. The overall serv ice was good but once again not like the Tequila. I am not bashing the Playacar but my first choice is the Tequila for sure. The walk to the beach from the Tequila is no biggie. I liked the layout of the Tequila way better than the Playa & also the lobby at the Tequila is very \"happening\" if you will. Weather was GREAT all week with the exception of on half day of rain. i was concerned before we left for they were forecasting rain all week but con't go by that because it changes so often. Xel-Ha was great as usual but if you can get the tickets from hotel & get a taxi. We are not tour bus people. We rented a taxi van for 140.00 both ways & had a wonderful driver, he dropped us off when it opened & picked us up when it closed & the hotel can set up with it.

Being our 3rd trip to Mexico, once to Cancun, the other to Puerta Vallarta, staying at the Riu Jalisco. But the RIU Playacar in Playa de Carmen was by far one of the best. PROPERTY: Very well kept. BEACH: The beach was one of the nicest. Plenty of chairs and lots palm trees for the shade. The only thing they are lacking is a little \u201cbeach bar\u201d to get a drink, rather than walking to the pool bar, but we did recommend this to Eric their Customer Relations staff, and the next few days there were guys bring down trays of drinks. POOL: Pool was very nice, pretty chilly. There are 2 pools, one had the swim-up bar and this is activities took place, the other section was very quiet and relaxing. There where plenty of chairs, and like the beach, had several areas with shade. SERVICE: The service was great! They bend over backwards to make sure you are looked after. Very caring, all around. FOOD: The buffet always had a huge variety and we liked just about everything. There are different food stations to choose from, always something for everyone. Specialty Restaurants: There are 3 (Mexican, Steakhouse, Asian). We ate at 2, the Steakhouse & Asian. Steakhouse was good, they give you plenty of food, so you don\u2019t leave hungry. The Asian was our favorites, we ate there twice. ROOM: Very nice, ours was a king bed, overlooking the walkway with a nice view from the balcony, close to the pool.

But, when they took us to the room it was horrible, very small and the balcony had a tall wall and overlooked a service area. We went to switch rooms and they said they only had a few king beds and those rooms were on the \u201ccorners\u201d\u2026so, I would say, avoid the king bed rooms. We then asked for a room overlooking the walkway\u2026.these had a much nicer view and were larger. But, there were bugs! This was the first time we have ever experienced this in Mexico. There were little tiny bugs in the bathroom area and tiny ants all over the room. The gross part was\u2026I opened a soda, put it on the nightstand, and 5 minutes later when I reached for the soda there were ants all over it!!! That completely creeped me out. The TV didn't have good reception and was difficult to watch. The beds\u2026.well we are used to the beds being hard in Mexico, but these were really hard and the pillows were like rocks\u2026and the bedding, well it didn\u2019t make me feel very comfortable. Overall, we did enjoy our stay, but if you\u2019re looking for more of a luxury hotel with a \u201cmore modern look\u201d, this may not be the hotel for you. If you do choose this hotel\u2026remember to ask for a hotel overlooking the walkway and bring an insulated mug!", "Date": "November 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manitoba", "Title": "\u201cAll that we expected and more!\u201d", "Author": "BigZee", "ReviewID": "UR6168923", "Content": "Wow!

There are lots of shops just outside the resort if you fancy a browse and haggle. They dont pester you in the shops like other destinations and leave you to browse at your leisure. The excursions were very expensive but are a must. It would be cheaper by far to walk out of the hotel across the road and book them at a stall. They are all run by the same company so you dont lose any quality. On each excursion you could save at least half the price by doing it this way.

If you were raised on a silver spoon at mom and dads go back home because the real world is not like that for most.

Well this is not the case if you actualy take a look around everyone works so hard its not even funny. If you get bad service you probably deserve it. Try a little tipping sometimes and quit being so cheap all inclusive dose not mean you can be a [--]. Also a please and thankyou works well if you demand they will ignore you and I would too. Anyways the rooms were plain but nice. Airconditioning was like an artic fridge. Lots of water pressure in a large shower with a never ending supply of hot water. Lots of pop beer and water in the fridge. Refilled every second day but if you run out call front desk and they will get someone to fill it. Only ever waited 30 min to get stocked up again. For extra of everything in the fridge put a little tip inside of the fridge. The beds were hard and its nice to be back in my own but still slept good. You get used to the hardness after a couple days. Food at all the restrants was good. always a litlle something different every night. But after 2 weeks you do get sick of it. The key to lasting for 2 weeks of buffet is not to always take everything you can at once. try something different each night and quit being pigs. The pool area was a little small but not a big deal if you need bigger there is a big body of water just steps from the pool its called the ocean so get off your lazy butt quit complaining and try walking 30 extra seconds. The pool area is very nice and the beach is unreal how nice it is. Never had a problem finding beach or pool chairs no one realy played the towl game. The entertainment team was great always working hard 16+ hours a day. One night one of the crew took my wife and I to the Mummbo cafe drove us in his personal car got us a table in a packed joint had a few drinks with us and did not expect anything in return I had to force him to let me buy him a drink. While down in playa we celebrated our one month of being married so the manager of the hotel booked us a dinner in the stakehouse when we arrived they had a table on its own for us with champaing on ice they baked us a cake and put congragulations on it and even had the waiters sing a few songs for us. When we got back to the room we found they had decorated it. There was ballons all over the place and fresh flower pettles around the shower around the sink and on the bed. They also gave us a big bottle of tequila with a couple little items one was an ashtray painted with the name of playa del carmen and the other was a small perimad.

There was lots of daily entertainment including, darts, horseshoes, shooting and water balloon fights in the pool - which was great fun. If you have kids, they will love this hotel. The entertainment staff were lovely and not \"in your face\". The food was the usual Riu layout, of cooking stations around the restaurant, there was usually a good selection and the salads were nice. The only downside, is that after 2 weeks the food does become a little repetative and I was craving a ham sandwich or a cornish pastie! Staff service was generally good, the only slow service we saw was the pool bar. I got the impression the staff were too busy eyeing the ladies to serve. Outside the hotel is lovely too. It's in a gated community with residential houses which are apparently owned by the local wealthy, according to our tour guide. There is a golf course in the gated area, but it's very expensive. Outside this area and into Playacar felt very safe, much safer than Jamaica. I would encourage you to take a trip to X-Caret to swim with the dolphins and manatees, it was really special and was a highlight for our holiday. Cancun is only an hour away and was worth a trip.

The other all-inclusive I stayed at in Mexico was the Iberostar Playa Paraiso Lindo, which was far superior to RIU Playacar. To start off, upon our arrival to the hotel, we found out that our key did not open the door to the room since the door lock was broken. When we contacted the staff, they were very unresponsive when we requested it be fixed. When it was fixed, they did not install the knob fully and the knob came off as we opened the door. We had to push the doorknob into place ourselves so it would not come off anymore. The staff was also bad in that they did not restock our refrigerator with beverages very often, and that we had two pairs of the same liquor in our dispenser, two bottles of tequila and two bottles of vodka. We were supposed to have four different types of liquor. A picture of this is posted. Our room overlooked the service and maintenance area of the Wyndham hotel next door, so our view was not very scenic. A picture of the view is also posted. Another aspect that disappointed me was the fact the hotel only had 2 ala carte restaurants, which were Mediterranian, which was very good, and a steakhouse, in which my steak had a high amount of gristle. The third restaurant, El Porche, was the buffet restaurant and it had fairly good food, although some meat was gristly and fatty. The other all-inclusives I stayed at had at least 6 or more ala carte restaurants to choose from. The property was very small, and the entertainment, activities and atmosphere were not nearly as upbeat as other hotels. The hotel was also old fashioned in that you had metal keys to enter your hotel room, rather than the plastic cards most places use, and the safe was opened with a metal key too, rather than a keypad combination.

I was given a plastic bracelet to wear all week long so the hotel could keep up with me & also for security purposes. You have access to the Tequila as well (don't let your travel agent tell you the Palace is available for lunch & dinner purposes because this is not true). There were only 2 real places to eat at night other than the buffet- which was not bad at all. The steak restaurant was your traditional lean steak with lean flavor. The mexican restaurant was something I could get off the buffet but with a fun, less crowded decor. The staff is fun and very helpful. Almost every staff member I encountered was more than happy to help me with my Spanish and visa versa with their english. If I did not have a clean room or towels or a restocked fridge at the end fo the day, someone rushed right to my room to fix this. Tipping (as anywhere you go) helps with your quality of service. Night life is very active at this resort. The Tequila has a great disco open til 3 am. There is also a clubhouse with pool, shuffleboard & foozeball- open 24/7! The Riu has shows & liquior dispensors in the rooms every night. One night the Riu even brings in local vendors: jewelry, clothing, souvenirs. However, the rooms & atmosphere at Riu is average. I did not receive nearly the type of cleanliness, upscale accommodations & attention I have received when staying at much nicer resorts in the past (in the same area). The foyer sets the tone of the rest of the resort. The resort has no air conditioning other than in the guest rooms (which isn't great).

Perfect smaller resort with the use of larger Yucatan and Tequila resorts. We read many reviews before booking so thought we'd better do our part to add to this helpful site. Our opinions are based on having stayed in many AI resorts throughout the Carribean. In the Mayan Riviera area we have stayed at the Barcelo, Bahia Principe Akumal, Copacabana, Gala and El Dorado. Transfer to Resort - Smooth and uneventful Check in - My compliments to the front desk staff. Very quick and accomodating. On arrival we asked for our rooms to be next to each other and as close to the beach as possible, which they were gladly able to do. (Bldg #5 third floor was great) Beach - (always our first priority) was gorgeous. On the same strip as the Gala and in our opinion the best area. Never a problem getting beach chairs for the four of us. Our one pet peeve was the people who created their own shade by unending a second chair to create an personal umbrella. The resort could use some palapas for shade so this wasn't such a problem as it sure takes away from the views if you're not in the front row. (Lots of topless sunbathing if that is an issue for you.) (Lots of boats and a very busy beach.) Beach Activities - We took sailing lessons and found the staff informative and easy to understand. The younger two in our party had a blast on the banana boats, boogie boards and parasailing booked at the beach. They also booked through the resort for the dolphin swim, sailboat cruise and snorkelling and had a great day! Pool - Looked great but we aren't pool people so can't really comment. Tons of activity in the afternoons and all seemed to be having a lot of fun. Was not over crowded and there were always lounge chairs and shade available when we passed by. Pool Bar seemed to be a hit in the heat of the day. Food - Buffet included lots of variety including fish, seafood, chicken, pork, beef, pasta, pizza, varied Mexican dishes, salads, vegies, fruit, desserts............the usual. More selection than many we've been to. We had no problem finding something to eat. There is an open air section in each restaurant so we could always be outside. Servers were attentive and we even got a few napkin folding lessons. Rooms - Beds are as hard as rocks. If that's a problem they have blankets and mattress pads available and I would request one and save your back as it does help alot. The fridges in our rooms were well stocked and any requests for extras were filled immediately. Phones worked without issue which isn't always the case in Mexico. Maids were great, sheets and towels changed every day. FYI there are blowdryers and alarm clocks in the rooms. Bars - 4 females had no problem getting drinks prompty and premium liquor was the norm. We found the bartenders entertaining and joined with them to create some real fun. Nightly show - Tried to attend one show but didn't last so can't really comment on them. They were always well attended so couldn't have been too bad. Staff - We found that every smile or \"Hola\" to the staff was returned. There was no problem with speaking English and if you were polite they went out of their way to help you. We did witness some very rude people that didn't get very far with that approach.........We just stood back, snickered and thought good for you. Grounds - Beautiful, clean and well kept. And in that heat you couldn't pay me enough to work that hard. Shopping - There is a bank and a dozen or so small shops right across the street from the lobby. Exchange rates are better than the resort offers. Store prices are typical resort prices but handy if you forget something or don't feel like going into town. Clientele - More Europeans than Americans/Canadians during the time we were there but not sure if that is the norm. Weather - We do not usually travel to Mexico during our summer months but with University students it was the only time we could go. Would I recommend it?? You bet!! Hot is great no matter when you go. The humidity didn't bother us at all. FYI - Our other notable excursions we would highly recommend. Took the ferry to Cozumel (45 min ride) and rented a jeep ($55 usd for the whole day) to tour the island. Great fun without the hassel of being on a tour. We snorkelled and saw pools and pools of fish including baracudas, swam in the crystal clear waters on the east side of the island where the beach is totally untouched. (A MUST SEE) The Blue Parrot Restaurant - Playa Del Carmen Serves a variety of food and great wines but their sushi is the best we've ever had anywhere........and we've eaten A LOT of sushi. The restaurant itself is a wonderful experience with individual treehouses over water pools. Located right on 5th Ave near the north end. To check it out before you go check out www.blueparrot.com (under beach club and dining) They also have a cool \"on the beach\" nightclub and hotel down on the waterfront.

We also had 4 liquor dispensers in our room with tequila, vodka, gin, and whiskey. Other amenities - ceiling fan, safe, two tables and a chair, t.v., extra blankets, dresser, and phone. An iron was available upon request. The resort had 4 different places to eat (two restaurants and two buffets) and 3 different bars. The steak restaurant and mexican restaurant required reservations. Reservations were made the morning of at the breakfast buffet next to the front desk. Reservation times were 6:45 p.m. or 8:45 p.m. The food was excellent at both restaurants. The food at both buffets was good as well. They had all kinds of great mexican dishes as well as hamburgers, hotdogs, french fries, fried chicken, salad bar, soup, fruit, vegetables, ice cream, pasta, pizza, etc... The cooks did a great job of keeping the buffet tables clean and full of food. The buffet by the pool also had a snack area with nachos and cheese, popcorn, and coffee. There was a small bar by the front desk, a larger bar (that usually opened in the late afternoon/early evening) by the two restaurants, and the pool bar. The pool was nice, especially the swim up bar. The pool as well as the lounge chair area was very clean. There was at least one person at all times picking up empty drink glasses or sweeping the concrete around the pool. The lounge chairs with shade were usually taken by 8 or 9 in the morning. But there were plenty of available chairs in the sun throughout the day. Water aerobics was offered each day as well as all kinds of activities around the pool (dance lessons, bingo, volleyball, soccor, ping pong, etc...). The bar drinks were good...especially the frozen drinks made with real fruit. Corona is the only beer available. And for those of you who like Southern Comfort like my husband, that's not available either. The beach was amazing...by far the best beach in the area. It had the softest sand and wasn't crowded like Yucatan Resort beach. There was always a chair to grab, even in the middle of the afternoon. There were plenty of motorized sports available like jet skiing, parasailing, banana boat, etc... We also had access to the RIU Yucatan and RIU Tequila Resorts. The Tequila was across the road from the Playacar and the Yucatan was a short five minute walk. We were able to eat at their breakfast and lunch buffets, as well as order drinks at the bars, but we didn't have access to the dinner restaurants. There was also a nice shopping area across the road from the Playacar. It had jewelry, swim suits, sunglasses, T-shirts, pottery, picture frames, etc.. Overall, the experience was wonderful. We would recommend this resort to anybody interested in visiting the Playa del Carmen area.", "Date": "August 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, England", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel.

The hotel itself is spotless and well cared for. Our room was lovely, cleaned everday with new sheets amd towels, the flowers etc left by the staff are a lovely gesture. The mini bar is restocked every 2 days but if you run out of anything, just ring reception and they'll sort it for you (if you can't wait for it to be delivered then you can collect it yourself from reception!!!) The reception manager rang our room many times to check we were ok and if there was anything they could do for us. There was plenty of food and a wide variety, again the staff were extremely helpful and you only have to ask nicely and they'll sort you out!!!!!! Yes, the restaurant does get hot at night but if you locate yourself under a fan you'll be fine...(what do you expect when there's cooking going on!!!!!) The bar staff were fantastic, we only had to show our face and our drinks would be waiting...I can personally recommend the Cosmopolitan!!! Again, if you ask you can have imported brands. There are two pools, one with the bar and a quiter one which is where we based ourselves. There is always a variety of activities going on to suit everyone and the animation team work hard to keep you entertained...if you don't want to participate there's no hassle either!! The pool was cleaned several times a day but you can't stop leaves falling from the trees!!! There are plenty of sunbeds, though it can be difficulut to find a place with sun and shade. There are big huts which is great for the shade but not so good when you want to sunbathe. There was no problem with the towels, you could change them several times during a day if you wanted!! Overall, I am unable to falut this hotel. All the staff work exceptionally hard to look after you, you don't have to tip them but they certainy deserve it.

I'm not a huge Riu fan but my friend eventually persuaded me. Check-in: Was smooth. Dutch girl at reception gave us all the information we needed; location of restaurants, opening hours, etc. Room was available right away. Room: Our room was ready and was ideally located near the pool (light blue building). Didn't notice a musty smell. The bathroom was a bit odd with no door but a curtain instead. I like to have the choice between bath and shower which was not the case here. I thought the room looked a bit dated. The beds were firm but I had no trouble sleeping in them. Restaurants: The buffet restaurant was nice. Food was hot and tasty. It gets a bit repetitive after a couple of days but what else can you expect when you are in an all inclusive resort? If you want variety and Michelin star food go to a 5star BB and eat \u00e0 la carte. Getting reservations for the speciality restaurant was quite an ordeal. Eventually got one for the steak-restaurant. Was good but nothing to be wowed about. We never had the chance to try the Mediterranean restaurant. They also should consider making it a totally non-smoking restaurant. Bars: Cocktails were below average. Have been to Iberostar in Cuba and DR and unlike here cocktails that ought to be made with coconut milk had actually coconut milk in them. As 2 single girls in their late twenties we never had trouble getting waited on rapidly. However, we did notice that some people had to wait quite some time to get drinks. Pool and Beach: Both were clean. Never had trouble finding a lounge chair by the pool. Being able to find one at the beach (in the shade) came close to a miracle. Entertainment: Daytime: darts, water volley, bingo, soccer, beach volley,... . If you don't want to participate they won't hassle you. I was able to read by the pool without being bothered too much. Night time: Went to almost every show. Before the actual show the animation team organise funny games. They do try hard, and its quite entertaining in an American pie sort of way. The shows performed by the Riu ballet are entertaining. We saw Chicago, Michael Jackson show,... . They also invite outside groups who bring you the history of Mexico in an amazing show. We also went out with a couple of guys from the animation team but it was just not our kind of bar. I have nothing against cockroaches, they have a right to live, but I just don't want them near my drink. Went to the disco at Riu Tequila a couple of times but the music was old and boring. If you have a couple of drinks you might have fun. Maybe we were just too tired because of jetlag. Excursions: Xcaret: Fantastic! We swam with dolphins and it was worth every dollar. Have bought magnificent DVD of this fabulous experience. Would do it again without hesitation. We also swam in the underground river which was a very refreshing experience. There is also a small zoo. At night there is a show which shows you the history of Mexico, the different national dances,... Mayan adventure: Was great. Don't do it if you are not the adventurous type and if you are acrophobic. Chichen Itza: A must. Don't miss it! Protect your head as it is a HOT place to visit!!! Guests: The people who visit this hotel are mostly Americans and Canadians. For the Americans who have a problem with nudity, didn't see too many topless women and thongs. For other Europeans: didn't have too many problems with Americans. We were particularly fond of that one American (George) who was as gorgeous as the real George Clooney. ;-)) Some Americans were loud and didn't have any education but that was just a small minority and some Europeans are no better so just try to get along. What bothered me most was that there were loads of people who carried jugs around with their favourite alcoholic beverage as from 10AM on. Hellooo, can you spell alcoholic. If you want to get drunk, fine with me, but don't bother others because you are a lousy drunk. Didn't pay too much so all in all it was an okay trip but next time I'll probably go to an Iberostar.", "Date": "July 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cBest Place for a Wedding\u201d", "Author": "AmandaL", "ReviewID": "UR5476253", "Content": "We had our wedding here in June 2006, with 43 of our friends and family.

I did not know what exactly to expect, but the Riu went above and beyond my expectations to met all of my wedding needs. The resort itself is beautiful- the most immaculate and lush landscaping I saw at the Playacar hotels (I walked through several.) The beach is gorgeous and pool with swim-up bar was a great place for my 37 guests to get to know each other. The food was great in the buffets- there was a huge selection and the menu changed every night I was there for 8 days. The service was the best part. From the time I stepped on the property, the entire staff knew I was the bride (guest of honor) and made us feel like celebrities. They truly have fun with, and care about, their guests and were able to make my dinner reservations to my requests for both the rehearsal and reception dinners. The wedding coordinators are wonderful and made sure to get the flowers, cake, music, etc. that I wanted. They even contacted my DJ ahead of time to give him my song list and he burned a bunch of music for me. They also got me a hurricane and other needed supplies. The best part for me was the photography. I was weary of having to use their contracted photographer, but Julio Paredes and his wife, Monica Luciano, were absolutely amazing. They stayed with me for 5 hours through the dinner and dancing. I purchased the largest package for $990 and they created and entire DVD video of the ceremony, a slide show with music of 400 photos and printed all 400 photos out for me in an album. Not only was their time and care appreciated, but the quality of their photos was stellar. Every shot was breathtaking and I am so happy to have this documentation of the event. The only thing that is too bad is that the hotel takes 1/2 of all their income as a commission. Be sure to tip them extra under the table, becuse they deserve it! The staff at the front desk worked hard to accomodate many small needs. They upgraded us to a suite for free and gave us another room to just sleep in at night when our AC was not cooling down our room enough. The Entertainment team was hysterical and the nicest bunch of people you will meet. The housekeepers work so hard and keep the rooms spotless- give them a small tip and you will get cute towel animals on your bed. Overall, the wedding was picture perfect, and all 37 guests had the time of their lives. We will definitely be back and I would recommend the Riu if you are looking for a destination wedding.

Went out one night with the entertainment crew to the Mambo Cafe. It was okay, $27 for entrance and open bar, but would only allow you rail drinks. Couldn't get anything special.

There was a great crowd of guests sharing our moment with us and a handful of videographers surrounding us...it was great. Check out our pix! The RIU chain and name is a guarantee for a great location and good food. All the important factors that make an amazing vacation. The accommodations are clean and comfortable, food was delish-nice variety every evening. We had our wedding dinner at the Steak House of course. The set-up and food was perfect.

The beach is exactly as you see it in the travel brochures-clean and soft beige white sands, picture perfect turquoise waters and subtle waves to enjoy for everyday your there. No complaints at all! If your not just a Beach Bum, the Mayan Riviera has endless things to see & do both day & night. Take a 5 minute cab ride to 5th Avenue for amazing shop'g boutiques, a day trip to Cozumel for unforgettable snorkel'g, eateries & shop'g, excursion out to the Mayan ruins of Tulum, try to go swim'g there too (don't go to Chitzinitza-too far & no beach), if your willing to spend more than US$50-$100-check out the many one-of-a-kind eco parks in Mexico like Xel-Ha, Xpu-Ha and Xcaret, for those that like their Tequilas & Coronas for partying definitely take the crew with you out to downtown Cancun-if there is one disco u go 2, it has to be Coco Bongo (u can also bring ur camera too-just don't 4get it there after all the drinx). Coco Bongo is US$45-entrance, a great show and all u can drink if u can make it thru the crowd to the numerous bartenders. In btween the week u can also party it up at the RIU Yucatan disco, only a 2 minute walk or crawl from the RIU Playacar-yes all u can drink here too & if u get out of the club on time u can enjoy BBQ munchies to soak up all the tequilas too. Honestly, if I could only go to one place every year, I would choose Mexico-Cancun or Playa del Carmen. There is soooo much to see and do thru all times of the day...and most of all if you love your turquoise waters like I do...Mexico is the place to take a perfect vacation, and maybe have a perfect wedding!

We had a fab holiday we went with our 4 year old. She could of done with more company her own age, however the animation team and the childrens reps could not of done more to make her have a happy stay. We loved the Riu Playacar and felt really sorry to be leaving. The rooms were excellent we certainly didn't have any bed bugs. Our room did smell a bit musty the first night but once you were in there for a day you either got used to it or it got better with fresh air circulating because of the fan and opening and shutting the door. The food was excellent and I would say it only became repetative if you weren't prepared to try something different. The animation team were excellent and worked extreamly hard I did not find them to pester you to do the entertainment they would just ask if you wanted to do the activities and if you said no they went on there way I never felt pressured once and would strongly disagree that this hotel was like \"Butlins\". The Riu Hotel band were- well what can I say they made me cry I don't think I have ever laughed so much they really should stick to salsa numbers Bridge Over Troubled Water and Eric Claptons- You look Wonderful Tonight were just too much !!! The mini disco well my daughter loved it and I think the animation team deserve a medal for doing that every night. The beech was lovely, white sand and fantastic blue and terquoise sea. In fact the only thing I found disapointing about this holiday was Thomson our tour operator. The planes need some rows taking out and some seatback tvs putting in. I feel that thomson are a very greedy company especially their trips they wanted to charge us $270 to go to xel-ha we ended up paying $160.

First time we visited it in 2004, so I can evaluate the damage Wilma hurricane did to Playa Del Carmen/Playacar villaghe and Riu Playacar and particular. I can say that damage in resort areas is not as significant as I have expected. It looks like thay have fixed everything by now. Some palms have lost few leaves, several bushes ,which formed a good shade in 2004, are not present, but in general it is still same good old Riu (and Playacar village). By item: 1. Food. To me food is great. You have a pretty simple choice for a dinner: a buffet and a restaurant which requires a reservation. Some people here complain about a necessity to make a reservation. Well..It will take you about a minute if you wanna do it:) Food variety in a buffet significantly exceeded our requirements. Wine is bad practically everywhere in Mexico, so it is bad in Riu. There were a lot of other kinds of good alcohol other than wine. 2.Rooms. Very clean. Beds are hard as in every hotel in Mexico. However it is not that hard that you can't sleep well after many hours of activity. I didn't notice musty smell other reviewers complain about. Before going to Riu I read a couple of reviews regarding bedbugs and decided to talk to Riu management. Here is their reply: \"We have read the same comments on the website, but we did not received any complaint here at our hotel. For your information we have been through all the rooms and have not found any bedbugs at all. The whole hotel is desinfectated every month and all the beds as well as the bedsspray's are desinfected as well. We have a certificate to show you if needed.\" NO bedbugs. NO any traces of bedbugs. I am well familiar with these insects. 3.Service is more than just great. Mayan people work very hard. 4.Pool. Personally I hate pools so I didn't even try a temperature of water in it. Pool's area looked rather crowded, it is true. However most \"pool\" people looked pretty happy anyway. I can say that those who looked unhappy are unhappy anywhere in the world. Staying unhappy is their life motto. 5.Beach. It is gorgeous. _Plenty_ of extra sunbeds, since most guests prefer swimming in the pool rather than in the sea. Shade is poor, but people manage to build nice \"cabanas\" using two extra sunbeds and a towel. You'll figure how to do it out pretty quickly after arrival:) However, it would be nice, if management could provide guests with sun umbrellas. It doesn't cost a lot of money, but it makes a lot of sense under Mexican sun.

Took advantage of the canoeing, sailing, tennis, volleyball that was offered on the beach... They have photographers that take your picture on the beach, and then post it in the lobby between 5pm -9pm, with your choice to purchase or not....this was a great idea, bought a few photos, especially the one with the iguana on our heads.... The beach was gorgeous, always plenty of chairs, were beach lovers and not fans of the pool, so it was really relaxing, especially when you just want to lie back and read a book, however if you want action, music and activities then the pool is your best bet.... Weather wise, it was pretty cloudy all week and it rained all day our first day there, which was slightly disappointing, however the animacion staff ensured they provided games and activities to keep our minds off the weather! One last thing that would have been nice to know was, they actually have a shower stall in the lobby bathrooms, we checked out at noon, but our bus didn't pick us up until 4, so it would have been nice to know that we could have showered before our departure, instead of using the cold showers by the pool....

Limited choice of restaurants, the two on this property were actually in the section where the lunch buffet is served in the afternoon, divided in half , (Mediterranean and Steakhouse). Both had limited menus (4 choices) and were far from what you would expect in a 5 star resort. Not worth the trouble of booking in advance. 10. No spots in the shady areas by the pool unless you wake up at 6:30AM 11. No spots for shade on the beach as most of the trees were damaged by hurricane. 12.

Snorkeling at Xel-Ha was easier than the ocean which is great for beginners. It also has other things to do when you get tired of snorkeling. The Play del Carmen town is much nicer than Cancun. The vendors will heckel you to come to their store, but once you are inside, they leave you alone and allow you to browse without pressure from them. We have stayed at the Moon Palace which is north of Playa del Carmen, and south of Cancun. The only advantage with the Moon Palace is the mile long lagoon pool, but the beach is not as nice at the Moon Palace. If you are a beach/ocean type person, the RIU is the better choice. We had 6 kids with us, ages ranged from 12-17. All had a great time, they felt safe at all times, and we were comfortable letting them wander about the complex to enjoy themselves.

The Playacar is very clean and safe and the staff are abosulutly fantastic. We have travelled to several all inclusives and I can truly say the staff at the Riu are number 1. The rooms did have a woody smell, however as long as you kept the air and fans running, it disappeared. I think you have to expect this with the high humidity. We ended up in an end room in the second building (right in the middle of the resort) and we had a true kingsize bed. It was a little hard however we never had a problem sleeping. As far as the drinks go, the slushy drinks were all good and all you have to do is ask for the premium stuff and tip a little and your drink is ready for you as you approach the bar. For those who enjoy a dark beer they have it on tap, you just have to ask, and a dollar bill every once in a while goes a long way. The food was pretty good also. Breakfast and lunch were also great and dinner had so much to choose from, if you planned it right, you could eat something different every night. The steak house meal was excellent as well, but did not have time to try the other one. The entertainment staff were quite enjoyable, and tryed to get everyone involved throughout the day, Bingo at 4:30 everyday was a blast. If you go to this area, you have to go to Playa del Carmen. What a neat place with lots of shops and tons of restaurants/bars to enjoy. If you want to barter for some goods, go off to the side streets off Fifth Ave., as they are more than willing to barter. All in all our trip was fantastic, but would rate this resort a four plus, not a five star resort. We did enjoy the size of it, as it is small enough you got to know the other guest's and staff very well.

We had a Blast!! We arrived at the resort at midnight and were given three rooms side by side as requested. We stayed in the Green Building on the ground floor. We liked the location because it was close to the 24 hour lobby bar (where we spent most of our time at night)and the breakfast restaurant. The rooms did have a musty smell that we had read about from previous reviews, but if you keep the air conditioning on it's not as bad (but we needed the extra blankets). The walls are also pretty thin. There was always lots of bottled water in our bar fridge, so no need to worry about water. But the water temperature in the shower was hard to control, it seemed to be either really hot or really cold. The power also went off in the room a few times. The staff at the resort were really great. There were always people cleaning and the main desk called twice to make sure everything was okay with our room. Although, the lobby never had any change(1 dollar bills) for larger bills, so bring lots of 1 dollar bills if you plan to tip. There are NO RULES at this resort, we could do whatever we wanted (like go swimming in the pool at 2am the night we arrived!). The drinks were good with lots of variety (Banana mama was my favorite) and no long waits to be served. Alex and Antonio took great care of us at the Lobby bar. The beach was amazing, so beautiful and warm...better than the beaches we had been to in Cuba and Jamaica. And we never had a problem getting 6 loungers together on the beach. However, it was harder to get loungers at the pool, but we usually ended getting some. There was a photographer on the beach who went around and took pictures. It was neat, because there was no pressure to buy them. The pictures would be set up in the lobby each day after 5pm ($6.50) for each picture. They turned out really good. If I had to complain about something, it would be the food. It was the same thing every night and I was surprised that there were no Tacos served. The pancakes at breakfast were the best! We thought it was weird that the supper buffet didn't open until 6:30 and lunch was over at 4:00. So from 4-6:30 there was only cold snacks. It was also annoying that you had to book the Steakhouse restaurant the same day and quite early (7-10am). But the steak meal was excellent. There was lots of activities during the day and hardly any children around. The nightly entertainment was pretty good. I liked the interactive activities with people from the audience. The Michael Jackson show was good too. We went to the Disco (at Riu Tequila) a couple of times, but it was small and stinky. It was fun to walk to the other resorts and have a drink at different bars. The Yucatan also gives out subs after midnight at the bar! There is shopping right across the street from the Resort with some great stuff. We also took a cab ($5.00) to Fifth Avenue where there is 30 blocks of shopping and Restaurants/bars...lots of neat stuff...a good place to go for unique gifts and souveniers and most of the people will bargain with you. We went on one excursion to Coba. It was worth every penny ($104 US). We left at 7:30am and went to the Coba ruins where we climbed the tallest ruins, swam in a Cenote (underground swimming hole of fresh water in a cave-really cool). Then we went on a Zip line and did Rapelling, took a canoe ride and walked through the Jungle to see some monkeys. I was worried about seeing snakes in the jungle, but thankfully we didn't see any. The weather was perfect..hot and sunny everyday. The last two days it was windy and the waves were huge on the beach. It was fun to ride the waves, but all the water sports were closed due to the winds. Overall, we had a fantastic time. One final warning, be careful about bringing back wood. We bought a wooden mask on 5th Avenue and when we arrived back at the Halifax airport, they took our mask at Customs!

I even sought out the PR manager to tell her that first impressions are everything. The bedspreads are really bad and my first impression on walking into the room is \"This place is a dump\"...But... its really not. I was worried about the beds but we all slept fine even though they are hard. Rooms were clean but bring your own shampoo and conditioner...they provide tear open packets of shampoo and shower gel (no conditioner and no lotion) We did enjoy the food choices. The Mediterranean specialty restaurant was just average however. The Steak restaurant was pretty good. You have to grab pool shade early because there just isnt' enough shade. Beach was calm most of the week which disappointed us because we like some wave action. Then on the last day when it was rough they wouldn't allow boogie boarding or swimming...but you can't control the sea. We did walk through the other Riu hotels. The Palace was big and beautiful. The Yucatan was big and more casual. We liked the size of the Playacar due to the fact that several times a day we are running back and forth to the room to retrieve stuff. At the other 2 Rius' its quite a hike...at the Playacar it was much more manageable. I agree that if you are looking for a 5 star the Palace fits the description physically...it would have been too big and inconvenient for our needs as a family.

I picked the right place as far as the beach is concerned. We walked all up & down the beach in Playacar and we had the biggest beach by far. That was very important to us. The room was very nice and there was no musty smell that I read about so much on Tripadvisor. The RUIs are very energy conscious, so the rooms are alittle warm when you first get in them, but once you put the fan and A/C on it's fine. If you open the balcony door the A/C automatically turns off and if the rooms aren't occupied all electricity to that room is off. The mini-bar was full stocked but the liquor in them isn't top shelf - but if you aren't picky I guess it's fine. They restock the mini-fridge every other day and it includes large bottles of water and soft drinks. The bathroom has a hair dryer and each day they provide bath gel and shampoo. Towels were soft and fluffy. A nice touch is that the toilet is in a private area with a door so if someone is using the bathroom the other person can use the shower/sink/etc. 2 Double beds and yes they were alittle firm but we both slept really well. The bar in the lobby is alittle too small but we would go up every evening and it was fun talking to people from all over. My husband is a beer drinker and he drank Corona on tap the entire time. We couldn't think of any place around here that has Corona on tap. I sampled all sorts of drinks and they were plenty strong and not made with cheap liquor. There was another Corona tap down by the beach in the Turquesa restaurant so even if the couple bars were crowded he could go there and grab a beer. The breakfast buffet was the best meal. Lunch was also good. The 2 sit down dinners were fair. The steak dinner was better - the steak was very good. The mediterrean restaurant was lousy. We walked out and went up the dinner buffet. That wasn't the best either but from what we gathered talking to a lot of people - most of the food at the all-inclusives is just fair. Lots of activities and my husband played volleyball every day - which he loved. The waves were great, but the water was alittle cool (I thought it would be alittle warmer). Flights were great - on time and I was very impressed with USA3000. They kept giving us food and drink the entire time. They also showed movies both ways. We visted both RUI Tequila and RUI Yucatan. We liked the Yucatan alot, but their beach was not as nice as ours. We would never stay at the Tequila, since you have to go to one of the other resorts to get to the beach. Another nice advantage of the RUI Playacar is there is a very nice little shopping mall right across the street. All sorts of little shops and outside vendors on cobblestone pathways.

So bad that it infiltrated my suitcase and I have had to wash EVERYTHING. They DO NOT have wait staff by pool or beach. Even at the crappy hotels you would have someone to wait on you by the pool. The food was VERY bland. We were sick of it by day 2. It was the same every meal, every day. My friend set the alarm clock every day for 6:00am to make sure we could have chairs by the pool. You had to physically go down to the resturant every morning by 7:00am to make reservations for their resturant for that night. I don't know WHY you couldn't call. Never got an explanation. There are 2 bars; one in the reception and pool area. Very small. We finally went over to sister hotel, the Tequlia and thought it looked a lot nicer than our hotel. There food was the same but looked and tasted so much better. We could not visit the Riu Palace Riveria Maya. You were not allowed to even walk through. You could only have breakfast or lunch at sister hotel, not dinner. And the beds were terrible, ROCK HARD. On the plus side, the staff was very nice and helpfull. And it was very CLEAN. Thank God. Bottom line, we would NEVER, EVER stay there again. One more thing.Every day they had activities around the pool. They absolutly insisted putting hugh speaker right behind our heads and turned it up loud. I have NOTHING against music, I love it. But when it is 1 foot behind you and blaring so loud that you can't talk unless you shout, its too much. We were nice, we asked if they could move it to a neutral spot several times. They refused. It was so bad that every time they walked away from the system, my friend would get up and unplug it. Usually it would take about 45 minutes before they would come back and plug back in. She did it 3 times. That provided some entertainment value.

We did enjoy the food and the beach. The property is nicely repaired post-hurricane, very clean- flowers and vegetation look good. There is some construction going on next door. The hotel customer service was less than desirable- front desk staff specifically, very rude at times.

The Riu Playa del Carmen has one wedding coordinator for all of the properties and they are running 3-4 weddings every day, so lots of stuff gets forgotten, our orders were basically forgotten -they gave me 14 chairs for 28 guests????

It's too long to list all the things that went wrong, preacher showed up 30 minutes late, the hotel doesn't even bother to arrange area surrounding ceremony, I have topless vacationers in my Wedding Photographer $400 pictures.

We were to fly out at 6:15pm but did not leave until 8:40pm with no explanation for the delay. Once in the air, we were told, due to head winds, we would have to land in Charlotte North Carolina to refuel before heading on to Cancun. We finally arrived in Mexico at 4am. It took a long time to get things processed at the airport as a few flights arrived at the same time and not many working at that hour. We finally arrived at the resort, again due to the late hour, no welcome greeting which is understandable. We went right to bed due to exhaustion at 6:40 am. Considering it to be a 5 hr flight and no storms enroute, we were not impressed with the airline. No entertainment at all on the plane and one stewardess insisted I leave the blind up where I was sitting at the window so as to see out of in case of an emergency. I have travelled many times but never encountered that!! We cannot say enough about this resort, however. Very clean, food was fabulous and people were friendly and helpful. They couldn't do enough for us and for that we were thrilled to tip them well. I would go back to this resort in a heartbeat. They go the extra mile to help you. I needed to phone home and our rep. sold us Mexican phone card for 24 minutes - $10.00. I used a portion of it and saved the rest to use at the next resort we were going to. We could not get a two week booking at this resort when we booked in October, so we had to move on to another resort closer to Tulum. Now that resort does not come near the RIU Playacar. And, I could no longer use the Mexican calling card I had purchased. We found at the Playacar, the maids were continuously cleaning. Not so at the second, resort. The bathrooms at the pool at the second resort were seldom cleaned and actually to the point of being disgusting. There was no working soap dispenser and only 4 small cakes of soap for everyone to use. You would not see this at the Playacar. Little things at the second resort, made us feel it did not rank the 5 star as advertised but the RIU Playacar is tops!!! Bar service is another thing. More than one person working the bars at the Playacar so no waits, whereas the second resort, we more often than not, had to wait in a long line as there was only one bar tender. We made sure we tipped him well and gave him Cdn t-shirts, socks, and a cap besides for his efforts. Basically it was too short staffed at the second resort but not at the Playacar. I think more people should consider this resort as it is not highly talked about as the others. You will love it. By the way, you can charge your digital camera at this resort, not the second resort we went to. I am not a demanding person, nor do I look for things to complain about.

I found that it was great for all age groups. I went with people in their 30s\\40s, mid 20s, late teens, and children ages 8 and 10. We all agreed that this was much better than any other vacation we have had in the past. The entertainment staff (animacion team) were all great, they really got you into the activities, but did not push you. The shows were very well put together. We especially enjoyed the ones with the audience participation. The entertainment team were all very sweet and were very quick to learn your name and to get to know you. We always felt incredibly comfortable and welcome. There was quite a selection at the buffets, the only problem that i can think of is that it was not changed up very much during the week, but there was more than enough selection to have something new each day. The food at the a la carte restaurants is amazing! the steaks were some of the best ive ever eaten, and the fish was incredibly fresh and tasty. The beach was amazing, beautiful white sand and clear blue water. There were a few people selling jewellery and cigars on the beach, but they did not bother you at all in fact they stayed out of your way and let those who were interested come to them. There is also a great selection of activities for everyone. There is a variety of sports, as well as things such as ping pong and darts. The guys who run these activities are also eye candy for the ladies.

After reading some of them we wondered if we were at the same place. We have stayed in other all inclusive hotels so here is our personal impression. We had a wonderful week. The hotel is smaller than the other Riu Hotels there, but that is what we loved about it. Close to the beach, pool, the main lobby and dining. The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to provide great customer service. The food is good and yes, it does get alittle repetitive by the end of the week but that is typical of an all inclusive. However, everyday they added something new. The variety is awesome and you will always find something you like. Try some new things. If you walk away hungry it is your own fault. I am still missing all my fresh fruit for breakfast! The rooms were clean and you would always find towels made into swans ect. on your bed. Nice touch. Yes, the beds are hard. We put extra blankets on the mattress under the sheets and that helped. I slept fine. The pool area is beautiful with lots of chairs- kids were no problem. If you want to avoid kids go to an all adult hotel like Secrets. The swim up bar is nice. The ocean and beach are beautiful. It looks like the pictures. The town of Playa del Carmen is a lot of fun and a 30 minute walk or a taxi ride for four people for $5.00. Make sure you go- and eat when you are there. There are many good resturants. There are many excursions you can take- book them at the hotel. We went snorkeling for the day at a national park and had a lot of fun. This was one of our most relaxing vacations and we would absolutly go back and stay at the resort. Not one person we met last week or in our group had anything negative to say. Keep in mind that you are visiting in a different country with a different culture. It wont be the way you do things at home nor should it be. How boring!! If you want to have a relaxing vacation at a nice resort, with friendly, warm people then this is the place for you.

Though no hotel is perfect, and this hotel does have a couple of minor negatives, we thought the positives far outweighed them. First of all, I have never experienced service as attentive, friendly and fast as I have at this hotel - Mexico or otherwise. Every staff member we encountered had a cheerful hello and a smile. They ALL seemed to enjoy their guests and their work. In fact, the 2nd day that we were there the front desk manager left us a gift and a note letting us know who he was and where he could be reached should we need anything. He even called our room that night to make sure we were happy with everything! We thought the grounds were beautifully maintained. There were 2 pools - both very large. One was quiet and peaceful, the other a little more lively with a swim-up bar, music and activities. The rooms were spacious and very clean. There was a musty smell - common in Mexico and very obvious to those of us coming from other climates. I noticed that the smell was very strong depending on the humity. On the days that weren't quite as humid - we didn't notice it at all. The mini bar was re-stocked every 2 days and you can't beat the booze dispensers! (see photos from other guests) The sheets weren't exactly soft, and neither was the bed - another common Mexico occurance. The beach had tons of chairs and a small hut with 4 massage tables. I did notice a bit of beach erosion from the hurricane all over Playa - not just at our resort. But, if you've never been there before, however, you wouldn't know it. We still enjoyed VERY long walks on the beach. Plenty of room for everyone. The food overall was very good. I'm not normally a buffet fan, but I was VERY happy with the selection and the made-to-order quesadillas, tacos, and pasta bar etc. There was a very wide variety of choices and they change it up most every day. It's rare for an all-inclusive to have good food - but this one does. The dinner at the steak place was wonderful! The only reason they insist on reservations is that it is a 4 course meal that requires quite a bit of prep. Yes, the drink cups are small, but our group purchased insulated mugs from a gift shop near by and the bartenders are more than happy to fill them with whatever we wanted! They keep your drinks cold and require less trips to the bar. They even have waiters that bring gigantic trays of assorted beverages to people on the beach. I liked this resort because it was smaller and you could get to where you wanted to go quickly. We did have access to the other Riu resort restaraunts so if we were in the mood for a change we didn't have that far to go. Just across or down the street! And the service was so personal! I loved how the staff came to know us by name after we'd only been there a few days! Contrary to other reviews, there were not that many children during our stay. A few young ones here and there, but mostly 25-55 year olds - if I had to guess. ALOT of people from Europe. Yes, be prepared my fellow uptight Americans, there's a bit of topless sunbathing and some very tiny Speedos on very large men! There is also a wonderful, funny, energetic, entertainment staff on hand to make sure you don't get bored. Ladies, do yourselves a favor and take a salsa lesson from Isreal - it's a treat - trust me. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay here. If you're looking for a spa-like atmosphere with 300 count sheets and luxurious amenities - this resort probably isn't for you. If you want wonderful, friendly, attentive service, a casual, relaxed stay, good food and great scenery, this is just the place for you. THANK YOU Saul, Gloria, Frankie, Luis, Carlos, Hanna and everyone else - we had a wonderful time! A few tips: there is a bit of construction going on next door - ask for a room on the inside near the main sidwalk or on the other side of the resort. The noise wasn't ever any louder than the blender at the bar, but if you think it might bother you - it's easy to avoid. Oh, and PS. people like to get started early around here so get your towels and use them to save the lounge chairs you want BEFORE you go to breakfast! No, there isn't an elevator, but there is a bellman to carry your luggage or get a room on the first floor- No steps!

Bad food options, tons of children, and not so clean. At checkout, we found the front desk personnel less than charming. We were told that dinner reservations could only be made at breakfast, and since we just checked in we would have to wait until tomorrow. So our only option that night was the buffet. We are accustomed to All-inclusives that offer at least 2-3 restaurants with no or flexible reservations. The last AI we went to was Dreams Cancun, which is in the same price range. We were given a 3rd level room. As we approached the building, the bellboy informed us that there was no elevator. My girlfriend and I are avid runners, so we are not simply Lazy Americans. But, I feel that a hotel that Apple Vacations lists as a 5 Golden Apple, should have an elevator. In their defense, the hotel manager offered to move us the next morning. It has very little options for dining. Lunch is limited to an outdoor \"very average\" buffet in a facility that didn't seem very clean. Sodas were available in a plastic cup about the size of a thimble. My girlfriend and I joked that the glasses reminded us of the milk glasses in Pre School. I am 34 years old; I prefer a glass that is larger than a half cup. Despite the cheesy rule of the strict reservations, I tipped the Maitre D so that we could get a table at one of the restaurants. In actuality, the Steak Restaurant and the Mediterranean Restaurant are actually just a bunch of tables in a closed-in eating area. The 2 restaurants are simply 2 different menus. While the service was pleasant, I'd like to have the experience of going to a real restaurant with real atmosphere. I think Riu can do better than that. The beach seemed nice. There were no palapas, but we knew that before we booked. The pool was packed with children, which is great for some but we prefer to stay at a distance. As far as the room, all Mexico hotels have hard beds and salty air. Other than that, it was fine. This hotel would probably be fine for a family with kids. But for adults, I'd say pass on this one. We were actually so disappointed; we stayed one night at Playacar, and moved to the RIU palace two doors down the street. We were given no credit despite the fact that both hotels were RIU.

The food ranged from good to much better; more important, even those with the goofiest dietary restrictions (and there were more than a couple) found items at the resort they could eat...and enjoy. The wait staff was very accommodating and became part of the entertainment. We had an impromptu Thursday evening get aquainted gathering at the Porche that was very fun. (We thought about bringing Fernando home with us, but knew his family would miss him.) Rooms were spacious and pleasant with towel sculptures for added interest. The location was perfect for night outings to great places like Ajua (live entertainment that defies description), Agua, and a rehearsal dinner at the Blue Parrot, that, thanks to Paula, was fabulous to provide just a little change of pace. The beach backdrop for the ceremony was glorious and we didn't mind sharing it with onlookers. Mariachis and maracas added a special touch. The reception was later than most American events, but it was lovely and personalization didn't reqire worrying about imprinted napkins or the color of the mints. Post-wedding activities included day trips to Mayan ruins, including Chitzenitza as well as excursions to Xcaret, and every imaginable water sport.

These people work so hard to make sure your stay is wonderful in every way. They are so friendly and pleasant. They will do whatever they can to please. Unfortunately the same can not be said for the front desk staff. They are all very pleasant and will listen to your request, write it down and tell you it will be handled, but they will do nothing, your request will never get handled. When you followup on why your request wasn't handled, they smile and go through the same routine again, and again your request will not be handled. They never apologize or make any attempt at customer service recovery. If you need something done, talk to anyone on the hotel staff except the front desk staff and you will get your issue resolved.

We went on a vacation to th Riu Playacar this past march. It was great! Our whole family had such a great time. One thing that was really great about the hotel was the fact that everyone was so friendly. Everyone stopped to chat and say hello. It was really nice and made you feel welcome. We had originally booked a junior suite. When we arrived at the hotel they didn't have one available so we took a normal room. We were offered an upgrade to the Riu Palace but declined it. The food was absolutely amazing. There were 2 restauraunts, the main buffet in the lobby and another smaller one adjacent to the theatre. We ate mostly at the big buffet in the lobby. It was very good. There was fresh squeezed fruit juce at breakfst which was great, but no maple syrup for the pancakes. Dinner was great, with both mexican and american food and many different kinds of meats and hors d'ouvres to try! Lunch was only served at the smaller restauraunt by the theatre. There was chicken, pasta, tacos and pizza as well as ice cream for dessert. We actually went on the kitchen tour in the large buffet and they made us great breaded chicken and showed us how they make these really neat carved watermelons that decorate the buffets. The beach was pretty nice. There are plenty of lounge chairs and a massage tent. There were equiptment rentals there too, hobie sailboats, paddleboats and surf/boogie boards. We went sailing on a hobie sailboat and it was very exhilarating, as the winds were very strong the week we were there. However, these winds created large waves with an undertow that A) caused the equiptment rentals to be closed some days B) caused the beach to erode a lot and a ledge of sand to form. There were jet ski rentals and parasailing places a couple of hotels down the beach so its pretty convenient. The pool was very nice. It was very large, it looked like one giant pool but was actually two seperate pools. This was pretty good because one end had a swim up bar and whirlpool so it was quite a bit busier. The other end was quiet, shadier, and had a fountain. Also the quiet end had a ramp to go in for anybody who might need that. The activities were fun for everyone. There were numerous sports tournaments thoughout the day and other activities to join. Some of these were ping pong, beach soccer, volleyball, shooting (i think) and bingo. The winners would get a prize (Riu t-shirt, visor, bag ect) and a certificate at the beginning of the evening show. The was a free scuba diving trial in the pool. I tried it and thought it was a lot of fun, because I've never tried scuba before. There was an aqua aerobics class each day in the pool and it was just as much fun to watch as it was to participate in! There was a show every night in the theatre. The pathways around the theatre were lined with vendors. THis was great to pick up some souveniers, especially these gorgeous paintings done entirely with spraypaint. As for the shows, they were mediocre. One of them, the 'cat vs. dog' one, was very fun. To go on trips such as Chichen Itza you had to walk down the street to the Riu Tequila to get on the bus. Because the buses came in the morning, breakfast was served for us there too. It would have been nicer if we could have gotten picked up at the marketplace across the street or at the Playacar, however. 2 nights before going home, we discovered that the bathroom plaster celing in our room was totally filled with water and was almost ready to collapse!!! The hotel was very good about it and helped us move rooms really quickly but it was kind of annoying considering the fact that it wasn't the room we had booked to begin with. Luckily, everything was okay, most of our luggage stayed dry and the ceiling didn't collapse or anything, but it kind of upset us.

It was alright, but I wish we would have stayed at a nicer resort, especially for our honeymoon, and an adults only resort. It seemed kinda crowded to us.

The drinks were good and the service was also good...the people work very hard there! The food however, got really old after the first few days and it tasted the same after awhile. We were expecting good Mexican food, but their Mexican food isn't like it is in the U.S. Neither of us like seafood, so that eliminated that. They did have a wide selection, but pretty much the same stuff every night. We didn't like the fact that we had to make reservations for dinner every night, and in order to eat at the steakhouse, you had to make your reservations at breakfast time the day of...you couldn't make it the day before. A lot of times, we wouldn't even eat breakfast...we'd sleep in, etc. We did eat at the steakhouse one night, and it wasn't anything to write home about. The beach and pool areas were nice though.

Period. There were of course some things we did notice about the resort, such as hard beds (they really are plywood firm). This is not such a big deal, usually you are half in the bag by the time you go to bed anyways, plus it gives you a firm surface for your after hours...umm...activities. The wasps were terrible around anywhere that had booze. We went in August and I think it has more to do with the time of the year. Didn't see any tourists get stung though. Those are really our only two negatives. Now on to the positives. The food is out of this world. The buffet is spectacular to say the least. We both ate everything there and didn't get sick at all. I really can't say enough about the food. Yes you have set times and tables for dinner....but who cares? It's nice cause you get the same waiter every night and if you tip him a couple of bucks US every night your glasses never get more than half full and the plates are cleared immediatly. The evening entertainment is just that...entertaining. It's not Broadway, but its not meant to be. We took in the show every night, it was fun and humorous, and they actually had some pretty cool stuff such as Mariachi. Lots of ethnic mexican stuff, just what we were hoping for. Both pools are very clean. Didn't use the swim up bar much due to the wasps. Oh, very important, get yourselves some insulated large mugs so you dont have to make so many trips from your pool chair. You can find these in the shop at the entrance or in many of the stores in Playa del Carmen. The ocean is spectacular and there is a large beach with palms, very scenic. The ocean water is very warm and does not do much to cool you off. Yes there are butts in the sand along with other garbage but I didn't blame the hotel for that. I dont expect them to have 100 people on their hands and knees pick butts out of the sand. You hardly notice them. Not a big deal. Playa del Carmen is cool and only a 5 dollar cab ride from the hotel. We paid for the cab cause we went with another couple. You could walk it easy but we were on vacation. 5th ave is completely blocked to vehicle traffic and you can walk the street drinking ice cold cervezas ($1) while the women shop. MMMM ice cold corona's. Mostly touristy crap but a lot of good restaurants. We ate at the Blue Lobster and it was good. 2 for 1 happy hour cervezas. Sweet. The highlight of our trip was a day excursion to Cozumel. Do it. Period. We took the ferry (20 mins) from Playa and there were people lined up on the pier at Cozumel trying to rent you scooters and cars. We rented two scooters and snorkle gear and rode on the road that goes around the outside of the island. It was a riot. If we saw a place that might be good snorkeling we would just pull over and jump in. Saw some amazing fish. They have little restaurants overlooking the ocean on the road with decent food for a decent price. We stopped at a couple of those for a break. I guess when it was said and done we spent probable 75 bucks per person. Cheap. I felt sorry for the suckers who paid for their package excursion and didnt get to do half the stuff we did. We did a day trip to Xel-ha. It was alright. The water was very cloudy when we were there. Would rather have spent another day in Cozumel. It was an awesome trip that we will likely never forget. The resort is great. It is not perfect but worth far more than what it costs to stay there. No doubt about it....phenomenal value. I think a trip is what you make of it. If you show up and immedialty start looking for the faults, you will find them no matter where you go. Go there to have a good time and you will.

I picked the BEST time to choice my vacation, not only was in Mexico but Wilma decided to check in also (lol). Yes, I was there during Hurricane Wilma, but even with that I cannot say anything bad about this hotel. The staff was more than professional during the 48 plus hours of the hurricane. I came to Riu Palyacar as a guest in a room and left with a feeling that I was leaving family behind. Part of that family was the staff that was warm and friendly before, during and after the hurricane. These people risked their own lives in order to keep the guests happy. They truly wanted to please the guests not only as a job but as a personal obligation to help others in the time of need. Anyone can do an outstanding job during easy times but when you have an extreme condition such as a hurricane and people put others before themselves, with little to no sleep, that is a sign of a great person. This Hotel is operated by a general manager that in my opinion is a fantastic lady. She left her husband and 1 year old child at her home during the hurricane without any communication with them, but still she gave 999% toward the guests of this hotel.

Before myself and my wife went we must have read every review and website about this hotel and to be totally honest we went with mixed feelings about it. Having never been on an all inclusive holiday before and never having been to Mexico before we were a bit worried about it not living upto expectations, but believe me those worries were soon put to rest. Were do i start, the food was excellent, plenty of choice superbly presented, tasted excellent and service was great. Being in the food industry myself i have high standards and Riu Playacar lived up to them. The Bar service was excellent, no problems getting served and always done with a smile. The rooms were also excellent, very clean and tidy and with just a small amount of tipping you got your towels made into all sorts of animals. Even the small things impressed us like the gardens were always being attended to, maintence of the hotel was always ongoing, even one day saw someone painting the rubbish bins, and it's this attention to detail thats makes the hotel stand out. Believe me once you've been to some of the Spanish and Greek Hotels that call themselves 4 Star, then this attention to maintence is a big deal. Then there's the excursions and Diving, we went on a couple of trips while we were there, swimming with Dolphins at Porto Aventura was okay, but we were told afterwards that the Cozumel one is better, we went on the Fat Cat Catermeran excursion which was superb, great value for money and excellent snokerling.I also tried Scuba Diving for the first time, did it with Scuba Cariba at the hotel, superb training given and the dive itself was well supervised, if you are planning doing a dive while you are there it's well worth applying for the riu discount card before hand and getting 15% off the normal price. Then entertainment at the Hotel was very good especially the Grease show, we also went up to the Riu Tequila and the Yucatan which were also very nice, but much prefered the smaller Playacar.

The staff are constantly working around you, always with a smile despite the high temperatures. It really was like paradise and we had a truly amazing stay. Rooms..... we tipped our maid $10 a week and the room was thoroughly cleaned everyday with fresh towels which were made in animals. Yes, the drinks in the fridge were plentiful but to be honest we hardly made use of them as we were never in. Food..... this was excellant, there was so much choice, even after 2 weeks you could still find something new to try. Drink..... Basically you could have anything you fancied. The drink is not watered down at all, in fact quite the opposite. I loved the cocktails \"Road Runner\" was my favourite although the tequilla boom booms were very good, we have Fernando to thank for them! Beach..... Wow! white sand and turquoise warm water. As you stepped out the pool you were straight onto the stunning beach. Well worth a view at night. Entertainment..... I can't stress how hard the entertainers work, there are activities all day and a show every evening, they work non-stop. The magic show is a must! Our favourite experiences were swimming with the dolphins and scuba diving. Our instructor was Birdie, she was lovely and if you have never dived before she will completely put you at ease.

The breakfast and dinner buffets are incredible at the main restaurant. They have 2 specialty restaurants but we never felt the need to go, as we were completely satisfied with the buffet.

Here are my comments and ratings out of 10. I hope you find this helpful because I sure did find this site helpful when booking my trip POSITIVES: Beach- It was busy but beatiful. The Hotel had a great oceanfront and the beach was soft and sandy and the water while a little choppy was very beautiful and warm. 10/10 Pool- The Pool and The Pool Bar were great. The Pool was actually two pools together and was also nice and warm. It is true that you needed to be there early to get a good spot... But here is a tip since all the guests did it, get a towel before you eat breakfast and put it on the chair(s) you want and then eat and go down later. And Yes there were bees around the pool bar so be careful. 8/10 Hotel and Staff- The staff were very friendly and very helpful. Good english skills. The Room we had was nice, simple and clean. Just like the pictures you see in the brochures. Very Nice. 7-8/10 Bars and Entertainment- The access to the other RIUs was a great part of this trip. I would reccommend the RIU Tequila's Pool as It was better in my opinion... I would say the RIU Yutican was about the same. Nice to travel to the different places for drinks etc. The nightly entertainment was pretty good... the Micheal Jackson show was awesome!! 7.5/10 Food- Believe most of the posting that the food was very good. I wont repeat anything not already said... I thought it was great with great selections. 9/10 NOT-SO POSITIVES: Pool- Lots of activity, ie kids jumping around and games which can be good and bad. If you want a serene swim as a couple it can be hard to find. They also closed the pool on one side for 2 days for repairs which was unfortunate but not too bad. Hotel Rooms- The walls and doors of are room were perhaps the thinest I have ever seen anywhere I have every traveled . I could hear EVERYTHING like it was two feet from my head. Hard to sleep in etc. This was a BIG annoyance for me personally, it didn't ruin anything, but it left this resort something to be desired to say the least. Bars- Sometimes the drinks were very WATERED- DOWN. The beer would be good sometimes, and flat the next. It was NOT corona at the bars, some people seemed to think it was but was local beer. Drinks were pretty ok at best. Kids- For some this isnt a problem... for honeymooners it may be. Just be warned there are a ALOT of families with ALOT of kids. This isn't meant as a criticism just as a small peace of advice if you are looking to book for diffferent reasons. Overall- I would give this resort a B+ - I could recommend it... I wouldn't say its the greatest but it had a ALOT of great qualities.

LOTS OF HELPFUL STUFF!!! Sister(20) and I(18) travelled to the RIU PLAYACAR from Dec. 28('04) to Jan. 4('05). I know you're probably thinking that that was a long time ago and wondering why I'm writing a review now. Well, I'm currently booking a trip to Cuba and realized just how much the reviews do help. So here's our wonderful experience. This being our first trip anywhere tropical, our minds were filled with dreams of palm trees, the aqua blue ocean and long lazy days on the beach. And the Riu Playacar more than provided. In fact it blew our minds! I'll break it down for you. Check-In: Was a breeze. You're greeted with a drink which tasted so good. In fact it might have been the best I had all week! You are given your towel card and shown to your room. All done very efficiently. Rooms: Were in Villa style accommodation and all very close to the beach and the lobby/main restaurant. Our room was on the ground floor and it was neat to be able to walk right out of the door onto the path to the beach, or lobby in the other direction. Room was clean and maid was excellent. She was so efficient that we never even saw her. We did tip her. Shower and washroom were clean and in good shape. It was fun to watch the Mexican version of MuchMusic or MTV...pretty funny. The only thing about the room, and this was not a big deal at all, was that the water from the sink smelled like sulfur or rotten eggs some times. But it's not like you're drinking the water anyways. Pool/Beach/Grounds: In a word...Imaculate. So georgeous and clean. And many lounge chairs everywhere. Pool is perfect temp. and so refreshing after a day in the sun and ocean. Swim up bar was cool and the other side of it you can walk up to and bring your drinks to the beach without getting in the pool. (drinks overall at resort are wonderful and plentiful/good variety) Do drink water during the day as it is so hot and you will get dehydrated with all of those Pina Coladas and Corona! Beach is breathtaking and the beachsand is awesome! The sun is blazing at 8AM and down by 6PM. Georgeous palms and like I said tons of beach chairs.(actually quite comfortable) Red Flags most of the time so we could not use the non motorized water sports. This didn't bother us because the atmosphere and the warm Mexican sun is what we were really after. Grounds are so well kept. Couldn't take a walk anywhere without seeing gardners and staff keeping the place absolutely beautiful. They stamp the RIU logo into the ash trays...that's how nice this hotel is. Food: SO AWESOME!! So much variety...really tasty. Buffet restaurant(El Porche) was amazing for breakfast and dinner. Everything you could want. The fresh squeezed juices in the morning were amazing. There must have been 10 different kinds. Beach restaurant(Turquesa) was good too. Food there for lunch and snacks. I liked the pizza, pasta station and nachos. The homemade salsa everywhere was so good! We went to the steakhouse which is actually part of Turquesa which turned into the a la cartes in the evening. My sister enjoyed it all right, but I got terribly sick...violently sick the next day. I ate the ribs. We went on the tour to Chichen Itza the day I was sick too so it completely ruined the tour for me. Throwing up in a towel the whole time...so embarassing. Met another guy who also got sick from the steakhouse. So just be advised. If anything looks under cooked DO NOT EAT IT. Service was amazing everywhere. Especially New Years Eve. So enchanting. They really went all out. If you're going during a holiday bring fancy clothes(and shoes). We were so glad we did. Everyone gets very dressed up. Entertainment: Awesome. So fun. Animation staff were so great and always had something on the go. Shows at night were good to excellent. A mexican folklore night with ancient drums, GREASE the musical, a magic show, an authentic mexican band(so good, the mariachi player was the cutest little man I've ever seen) and a show of dances from all over the world...from Africa to Brazil...Arabia, U.S.A., Argentina Italy and many more. So well done. the dancers are extremely professional. Disco was fun, but very dark inside(at the Tequila.) Tons of stuff to do at the resort. Let go and do the audience participation stuff. So many laughs. Tours: We went to Chichen Itza, Tulum and Xel-Ha, Cozumel, as well as into Playa Del Carmen. Chichen Itza would have been awesome if I wasn't sick. It was neat to see the way the Mayans live. They live in huts, but they have satellite dishes...Bizare to me. It was quite sad too. You stop at an authentic market, go swimming in an underground well(amazing) and see the ruins. I would not reccommend this tour for young kids and the elderly as it is very long and Chichen Itza is extremely hot. Though they do give you lots of water. If you go, enjoy it, just don't eat any slightly undercooked ribs the night before:) Tulum was the most beautiful place I have ever seen. The ruins are set against an expance of ocean so blue it blows your mind. It is well worth it and I recommend this tour the most. Xel-Ha was ok. It was beautiful and lush. But the lagoon doesn't have very good snorkeling. It was still neat though. But we could have done without it. Cozumel was cool, but the shopping is the same as in Playa Del Carmen. The ferry made both of us sick. You have to have your sea legs and a strong stomach. Playa Del Carmen is well worth a visit. It is bustling and colourful and full of culture. Tons of market style shops and also a more modern area. Exchange your money in the heart of 5th avenue as the rates are much cheaper, or just bring american money as it is widely accepted. You name it, they have it. Barder and you will get good deals on jewelery/crafts. Sarongs are $5. Try walking away and they will call you back with a cheaper price. It gets exhausting after a while and if you are not with male companions you will get hit on. And that can be very annoying. Oh well, it's all in the experience right:) It takes 20 min. to walk there and a taxi is $5. The vacation homes along the way are really something to see. I would recommend to do less tours than we did as we felt like we did not have enough time at the resort. One week just doesn't seem like enough!! I think I've covered everything. The RIU PLAYACAR is amazing, completely 5* in every way and you will enjoy yourself. It is worth every penny and more. My advice...pack a smile and the word \"Hola\" and you will have the time of your life. I hope this review helped.

The Rui Playacar accomadated us relatively quickly. When we arrived at the check in counter, they greeted us with two cold drinks, which was extremely nice after traveling all day. Our room was very nice, we were able to control the temperature with the air conditioning and the ceiling fan. The mini bar in the hotel is included and restocked every other day. Yes, there are only four beers inside but we could just walk downstairs to the bar and get all the free beers we wanted 24 hours a day. Housekeeping did a wonderful job cleaning the room daily. The food is great and had such a variety. You could eat basically anytime of day. They serve breakfast until 10:30, lunch from 12 to about 4, then they have snacks and then you can choose to have dinner at either 6:30 or 8:30. We always chose 8:30 since we spend so much time and the beach and pool. Both the beach and pool are great. You could easily take drinks out on the beach and there is a pool bar which is very nice, and another bar across from the pool and the bar in the lobby is open 24/7. We spent many evenings in the lobby bar meeting and mingling with others, which was very fun. The whole entire staff is SO friendly and helpful. We loved our stay and would return to the RUI in a heartbeat. The other nice thing is that there are two other RUI's in Playacar and we could visit those hotels too, and that was included in our all inclusive. One night we walked to the RUI Tequila and went to the disco and bar and didn't have to pay a dime.

I was surprised at how clean everything was. There were no obvious signs of damage, other than the palm trees that had blown over and were being propped up. I saw trees with broken branches and most of the leaves had blown off. Other than that there was no structure damage that I could see. We didn't get too far from our resort, other than into town. I saw little, if any damage in Playa. My only complaint about the RIU Playacar was that for a \"Fully stocked bar\" we were only allowed 4 beers, every other day. There were liquor dispenser with Gin, Rum, Tequila and Vodka....but since neither of us are booze drinkers, this did not appeal to us. We really just wanted to throw down a few Corona's in our room from time to time. We finally had to bribe a guy to get us a 6 pak that we put in a plastic bag with ice, and smuggled it down to the beach! We ALWAYS cleaned up our area! The pool bar was great....lots of fun AND lots of bees! So if your afraid of bees, stay away from the pool bar! I was not at all impressed with the food, although the variety was vast...yet tasteless. Bland. I also would have preferred to be able to eat when I wanted to. Instead we had to make reservations for the buffet....for the BUFFETT!! If you got to the restraunt too close to the time of the next seating, you couldn't go in. The \"specialty\" restraunts were nothing to write home about. I'm glad I was only there for the weekend. As a travel agent, I look for the good and the bad in a location/resort. For the money, I don't think I would stay at this resort again. If I did, it would be to see the great lookig men that the RIU Playacar employees! Oooo-la-la those are some good looking men!

The rooms did have a very STRONG musty smell. One of the deciding factors for picking this hotel was that there were 2 pools. Well, one of them was closed being painted, repaired, etc. The food was okay. Last year we stayed at the Riu Cancun (in Cancun) and it was rated the same. The Riu Cancun was MUCH nicer. First, it is a much newer hotel. Well, on our second day we received a notice in our room saying that they would move us, AT NO CHARGE, to the Riu Palace Las Americas (in Cancun). WOW!!

Service from the staff was better than a five star hotel in London. The grounds are well-maintained and provide a tropical paradise ambience. The food is plentiful. While it is not Paris dining, it is delicious, with a wide variety. The RIU Playacar is located within the Playacar development of luxury hotels and residences. It is a sheltered view of Mexico. Playa Del Carmen is only minutes away ($5 by taxi) where there is plenty of shopping and a more genuine feel of a Mexican city (pop. 350,000). We felt safe the entire time we were there. The Mexican people are delightful. I have found this to be true in every part of Mexico (not counting the border towns from California to Texas). They are hospitable and friendly. While my partner and I could have relaxed the entire time at the resort, our kids were glad that we took 2 excursion trips. Both were all-day trips. First, we took the AllTourNatives trip to Coba and the native Mayan village. Great time. Second, we took the Mayan Adventures snorkeling tour. Excellent. Both trips were in brand new Ford vans with A/C that seated appx. 12 people. The drivers were safe and the tour guides entertaining and very accomodating. We learned much about the natives and the environment of the Yucatan peninsula. I don't usually stay at a hotel or resort more than once. There are too many other things to see.

We were absoutley blown away when we entered the grounds of the playacar. When we got off of the bus from the Airport we were greeted by friendly faces and everyone saying HOLA and then pointed towards the bar for a welcome drink! We were given our key to our room and we were both soo very excited to get to our room to see what it looked like and to see our view. We walked in and we both said WOW! it was soo extremely pretty and well we were worried about the smell because we read soo many reviews saying the rooms were a bit musty from the ocean. Ours wasnt to bad, but we were prepared with airfreshers. We stayed 6 days and the first 3 where great but it rained almost everyday we were there. But didnt mind because it was warm and we just stayed in the pool and enjoyed the pool bar in the rain. We both highly recomend to book a snorkling trip thru Fun Quest(glass bottom boat) it is a fairly cheap trip (to cozumel) and they took us to 3 different reefs and OMG talk about beautiful. AMAZING!! I am scared of large bodies of water and well lets say i would of done this everyday if we could of. Totally amazing and absoutely beautiful and the tour guides were FUNNY and soo VERY friendly and helpful! it was like 38 bucks per person and that included our fairy ride over to cozumel. WONDERFUL wonderful! Now back to Riu. The staff was amazing and the enterainment crew were awesome. They so deserve recognition for the extremely long hours they work and all the fun they provide to not only the kids but all of us adults as well. We got many laughs from the silly things they would do, wether they were planed or some not planed they gave us many laughs. The towel girl at the pool was very friendly every single day and always had lots of smiles to give and a nice warm hello! One thing we read here and do also advise it is to take a insulated cup/mug for your drink. It not only keeps stuff from melting so very quickly but you also get more and they gladly fill your cup to the top! Now about the beach. We both enjoyed it very much but was surprised it wasnt a tad bit cleaner. There was alot of dibree on the beach and even after it was raked. The errosion was pretty bad but didnt take the beauty away from the water. Lots of waves while we were there because t here was soo much rain.

I really enjoyed the Friday night show of the Maya Indian ceremony. The swim up bar was always a delight. The beaches were clean with plenty of chairs for everyone. Sevice from the staff was wonderful as well. No one could go wrong. Im ready to pack my bags for a second trip to the same place.", "Date": "June 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cHoneymoon at the Riu\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3550078", "Content": "Upon arrival we were greeted with tequila sunrises, followed by a very fast explanation of how things worked, then off to our room. I read reviews that the rooms smelled so we took air fresheners however they didn\u2019t smell at all so I have no idea what that was about. You need to make sure to tip the guy who restocks your refrigerator. They say they restock it every other day but tip him and he is there daily with a smile on his face. Also tip the bartenders and get to know one of them. I liked the women bartender. The whole time she tendered the bar in back of the poolside bar. Pool was not too crowded and neither was the beach. Beach was eroded but beautiful. Water was really choppy but that was good to us. We had a blast jumping over the waves and riding them on the boogey board or letting them take you towards shore. One day the water was really calm and it was pretty dull. Food was awful. The first day everything was pretty good, second it got tired some, then it just got bad. You have to register each day before 10AM to get a seat for the non-buffet diner. DO THAT! The lunch/dinner buffet gets old fast. We are from Texas but it was HOT and HUMID there. The rooms AC units are not up to par for that heat for us. At night with the fan on full blast, a thin sheet on and the AC running all day it was still not cold. The showers are AWESOME! The rooms are actually really nice to be honest. No complaints at all except for the AC but we like it freezing. Drinking gets old and you feel kind of trapped there. Go into town. You have to ride a taxi but it\u2019s easy just go across the street and call one. In town they are everywhere. That takes up a day. Here is our best part of the trip. Go to Xel-ha. It\u2019s about 30 minutes away and about $100 per person for the trip and full amenities there. It\u2019s awesome. The food is GREAT! They serve Modelo but who cares right? The snorkeling is the real treat! We saw huge schools of neon colored fish, sting rays, etc. right there in your face. It\u2019s amazing! Plus they have a lazy river, cliffs to jump off of, hiking, etc. etc. Plus huge lizards everywhere! Awesome place. We also went to Tulum was ok but we have an excellent tour guide. Get one or else it will be boring. You can swim on the beach, better than the Playacar\u2019s and swim in the backdrop of ancient ruins. Overall we had a good time. The only things we didn\u2019t like were the food, AC, lack of night entertainment (consisted of couples simulating sexual acts and taking shots).", "Date": "June 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Troy,IL", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Debbyu", "ReviewID": "UR3546810", "Content": "We spent May 21-May 26, 2005 at hte Riu Playacar and had a great time. We were going for our 30Th wedding anniversary and I was a little afraid of some of the comments that I had read on this site but now I am so glad that we chose this resort. I will say that we did not have one problem with this resort. We stayed at the Riu Palace last year and liked this resort better(and it was cheaper) The food was exactly the same. The alcoholic drinks were the same. The rooms were almost the same except for the bathrooms. We did not have a smelly room or drain problems. Every one at the hotel was very nice and worked very hard. On our anniversary we went to the steak house for dinner and the workers made a special cake for us and came over to our table and sang. We really loved this hotel. It was smaller than the Palace but much easier to get around. The hotel is right next door to the Riu Palace and The Royal Hideaway(very high dollar) so the beach area is basically the same. Yes, I will say that last years hurricane did alittle damage to the beach but you can't blame that on the hotel. I did not have any troulble walking the beach or getting down from the palm area. The only thing bad I can say about this hotel is that they need to spend alittle more time cleaning the pool. It did have a little scum line around it. But we had so much fun at the pool bar we really didn't care if the scum was there or not. They have a few activities in the afternoon like water baloon fights, bingo, dance lessons and so on. I won a t-shirt one day because after the baloon fight I turned in the most broken pieces of baloon. This is a great way to clean up the mess. We only went to one show at night because we had seen most of the shows last year . The show we went to was fabulous. The dancers were like wathcing a Las Vegas show. The bar down at the show area is the best!!!!!!!! The bartenders really try to please you and they also are very friendly. They showed my husband a few tricks like holding a glass full on liquid with only 3 fingers. He is going to practice on that before he tries it at one of our next parties. Please give this hotel a try I know you will not be disapointed. We have been to Cancun 4 times and Playa 2 times and this has been our favorite hotel so far. We would go back in a heart beat.

Also if the beach doesnt seem to fill up that fast... but if you want to go rite byt the beach make sure to go there right away. They pool on the other hand was really crowded. We got there i think at 830 one day and all the chair were filled up.. so if u like the pool go there quickly. The food was basically the same everynite. They had different meat dishes( roast beef., duck etc.) but the side dishes were basically the same as lunch(pizza, fries etc) They have a snack sation by the threatre, which had popcorn and nachos with cheese. The bar tender are really friendly(basically the whole staff is) and if u really want to impress them try speaking spanish(augwa haha is water in spanish) The animation team is really fun... and the games they have at the beginning of the show are entertaining to watch. Also there is no need to really go into playa del carmen since there is a little market rite outside with a lot of AIR coniditon shops( haha it does make a difference) Yea the only thing i would suggest is that if u arent really for loud people dont go by the pool around threeish since because of the open bar haha, yea but one yur firt full day i would recommend a spanish class to help u around your stay.

The food was very good for an all inclusive. If you don't like the food, it's not there falut. There was something for everyone, lots to choose from. They really try hard to please everyone! We did eat one night at the Medeterian Restaruant. The food was very good, but it seemed to take a long time to serve! Not a problem since we had nothing else planned!

The staff was wonderful and sure go out of there way to please you. The room was throughly cleaned every day, and it was spotless, they made little animals out of the towels and blankets with fresh flowers. Another nice touch! The mini bar and fridge were great, I loved the bottled water, stocked every other day, but if you ran out of something, just call and they would restock (and they did). We spent the first day at the pool. Very fun, but decided to try the beach the next day! This is then the place we camped out for the next 4 days! The beach was beautiful. There were plenty of chairs, sun or shade, just choose your spot!!!! It was a little walk to the bar everytime you needed a drink, but hay a little exercise is good for you!! The nightlife was a little quiet, but that was ok with us, we did head over to the Riu Tequilla one night and that was a lot of fun. At the Riu Playacar they did do a Michael Jackson show one night and that was fun to watch! There isn't anything negative that I have to say about this hotel.

I have to say that the hotel is really just a moderate hotel, but the grounds are beautiful, well kept, and the beach is gorgeous. The beach front was fairly expansive with lots of palm trees scatterered among the beachfront, which gave it a nice tropical feel - great weather and a wonderful breeze. The swim up pool bar is a refreshing break from the beach as there is no beach service at the Riu Playacar. The food was adequate - nothing gourmet. I was tired of the buffets after four days, but there was a nice variety. The two evening dining restaurants, the steak restaurant and the Mediterranean are in the same place and their menus don't seem to change from day to day. The food was fine though. If you are staying for 7 nights, you will probably get a little tired of them. I suggest taking a cab to Playa Del Carmen and sampling one of the restaurants there. It is a charming little town with alot of ambiance, and you can find some great little restaurants. The rooms were ok as far as hotel rooms go, nothing luxurious, but this is not a luxury resort. Beds are hard, room stays cold, bathrooms are spacious. I would recommend taking Mosquito repellant. I have been to Cancun/Riviera Maya many times and never had a problem with bites. This time, however, I got biten up good by Noseeums - tiny, little microscopic mosquito type flies that live in moist, sandy areas and breed in the ocean.

Just a couple dollars here and there and maybe as you checkout is all and even that wasn't expected.

The town is nice with plenty of shops and quite a few restaurants. If you decide to go to Cozumel on the ferry the ticket booths can be confusing but either one will get you there at about the same time and the price was about the same 32-36 USD round trip per person.

The day before we left, we were told that wasn't enough time to perform the blood test and that we would need to \"TIP\" the judge to make it happen.

This year our group of 29 people decided we wanted a smaller resort. Previously some of our group had stayed at Riu Playacar and had enjoyed their stay. It is hard to please a large group. ROOMS: Yes the beds are hard, but you are so tired at night from swimming, volleyball, body surfing and walking the beach you sleep good. Our room 2218 did not smell(if it had we had air fresheners). The only complaint about the room is the KEY you need to carry with you to the safe and room. The towel animals were fun. REMEMBER TO TIP !!!. FOOD: Our group of 29 ranged in age from 8 to 43. Everyone found something they liked to eat. Breakfast to dinner was very good. Ham is not the ham that we americans are used to.Roast pork is our ham .

BAR: Corona is the beer on tap, Pepsi products and 7-up are your soft drink choices. SHOWS: Good The town of Playa Del Carmen is a little over a mile away. (4 dollar cab ride.) It is a nice place with shops that you can buy jewelry to junk. Make sure you shop around. If you like to cook buy Vanilla to take home, it is very good. Everywhere takes US dollars.

We arrived around 15.00 hours and got a very warm welcome. The woman at the rece ption (as well as the manager from the hotel) spoke Dutch, and although we didn't expect a warm welcome in the Dutch language while we are in Mexico it was a nice thing, while we were in the plane for about 11 hours and a bus took one hour. We got an explanation how it works with the Riu-hotels, like the dinner times, one is at 18.30 hours and one sitting at 20.30. You gave your room number and you could eat the whole week at the time you reserved, or if you wanted a change the time to earlier or later no problem as well. You also had your own table so you don't have to look for a free table. And a separate smoking and non-smoking area. Also we got two towel-cards which we used every day. During the day you can use all the activities and meals (except diner), drinks from all the Riu hotels. If you wanted they even could arrange an excursion to the Palace hotel to show you around this great hotel. Sometimes they also offer you a possibility to book to Riu Palace in Cancun, so if you want a change take it. Before you book your Riu hotel ask for a Riu-classcard via their website. You are saving points each time you are staying in a Riu hotel (doesn't matter in which country or when because they have hotels all over the world). With the Riu-card you can also pay for telephone/fax etc. costs or have an upgraded hotel room. Go to ---- and see what has to be done. The hotel rooms are very good with hard beds (twin or double) but very comfortable, there is a refrigerator, an A/C which you can regulate yourself, separate toilet-room, shower (which is great enough so you don't have any trouble that the shower curtain will stick against your body), a liquor-dispenser with booze as well as a safe deposit box and of course a hairdryer. There is also a great balcony with table and two chairs as well as clothes-horse. In the room there is plenty of space to tidy up your room, although the lighting at night in the room could be a little bit more if you want a read a book before you go to sleep. The musty smell is a part of the tropical weather condition and when you use the A/C it will be gone very soon. The room has sliding French window and when you don't like the A/C on all night you open the window because there is a insect screen so no mosquito/other bugs will come inside. Especially for the European people who read this review: take an adapter which you need to refill your batteries from your digital camera, video, MP3 or GSM or raiser. In Mexico they have 110 Volt instead of the 220 Volt which we are used to. Also bear in mind that you need a triple GSM, a dualband phone is not working. I had my birthday (41 years old!) the next day we arrived and the hotel maid had made beautiful animals (which she did every night but this night my bed was completely full with it) from the towels and there were about 10 balloons with all kinds of faces hanging in room, which was a nice gesture. By the way we had room 223 which was on the second floor at the end of the building and we had only one neighbour and looking over the \"Riu-boulevard\" which leaded to the beach. The property of the hotel is very clean and it is one of the smallest of the RIU hotels in Playacar. Although the hotel was completely full you could not tell because lots of people go on a trip or do some shopping or stayed at the beach at Riu Palace or Riu Yucatan. At the property of the hotel were also a lot of animals, like birds, lizards, squirrels, cats (you don't see them in the restaurants) and a strange kind of marmot. The hotel has a great beach which lots of trees and chairs, although about 15 meters of sand has washed away, but there is still lots of free space (also without trees) to put your beach-chair. We are beach people so about the swimming pool I can not tell your much, although I noticed there were always lots of chairs. Although at the end of the day (around 16.00 hours) there were hardly any beachchairs left. The water of the swimming pool was clean and great, not too cold not too warm. There is also a great animation team which start around 10.00 to do all kinds of exercise, Spanish lesson, bow and arrow play, volleyball, waterpolo, dance lessons, bingo and at night there were always great shows. By the way learn of view words of Spanish before you go to Mexico and the people will treat you like kings. The restaurants are great. The main restaurant is where you have your breakfast and diner. In the morning they have great choice of bread. Do you like toast make it yourself or take another kind of bread. There also juices, jam, cheese, eggs, milk, plane yogurt as well as strawberry and peach, fruits, meat, even peanut-butter corflakes, tea- or coffee or croissants or cakes or sweet-bread. If you like a hot meal in the morning also that is possible. At lunch there if a buffet in the restaurant near the theatre. There is also lots of choice like hamburgers, French Fries, macaroni (just ask the chef and he will fix you your once choice), salad bar, rice, fish, meat, pizza, fruits, all kinds of pastry and of course ice-cream. Diner you can use at the main restaurant or the two other restaurants at the property, but for these one you have to make your reservation in the morning with breakfast at the bar for the same day. We only tried the fish restaurant. It was very good. Diner is also great and many choices. There is always fish, shrimps, meat, potatoes fried or cooked, vegetables, also a table where they cook macaroni at your own speciality. Lots of fruit, pastry, ice-cream and salad-bar with of course the different kinds of olives. And also for the one who like to have sauce there is enough like mayonnaise, ketchup etc. The drinks in the hotel are also great. There is a card which will explain what is in a certain drink. Just ordered it and try it, if you don't like it order another one. And for some who are diabetic there is also soda, diet pepsi, water. Of course red/white and rose wine, bear. By the way you must try the Mexican coffee, delicious. Across the hotel there is a small Playacar shopping mall with clothes, drugstore, all kinds of souvenirs. If you want to go to Playa del Carmen you can do that easily by foot or when you are tired just take a cap and it will bring your there for only four Dollars. Don't forget when you are going to Playa del Carmen by foot, it is warm/hot, your foot will swallow and it is about 20 minutes steady walk. Also in Playa del Carmen there are lots of shops, restaurants and bar. My advise is not to stay in the hotel for your diner every night but go out once and take and marvellous diner in one of the restaurants. Most of the times there will be a Mexican band playing all kinds of songs and music to give you the right feeling of Mexico. You don't have to exchange your Dollars you can pay easily with Dollars, only it is a little more than the Mexican pesos. The excursions you can book with your travel agency, but it is also safe to book this across the street or in the centre of Playa del Carmen. Take your pick and enjoy yourself. We took a local bus which is going from the Centre of Playa del Carmen to Tulum, which was a beautiful temple at the sea with beautiful views. When people ask me do you want to go to this hotel again, I immediately would say YES.

If you are looking for a couples only with small crowds, check out El Dorado Royal Resort and Spa. We've stayed there too and it was great and private.

Considering all the other choices, would not stay there again unless price was considerably more attractive. Staff great and food fine, but there were other problems. Went with adult daughters and their husbands plus my spouse. Close to Playa del Carmen if that's an attraction to you. Meals - Seatings at 6:30 and 8:30. Seems to be no reason to have to make reservations. Reservations means you have assigned seating each night. If you go about 7:30, you will be rushed because they want it cleared out at 8:00 and closed for a half hour. Silly practice and not what I experienced at other resorts. Menu stays the same. Only have two specialty dinners: steak and mediterranean. Only a few tables available for reservations. I had to get up at 7 a.m. to make reservations. Breakfast is the best. Again, staff is great and friendly. Other Riu's to use: The Yukatan is closed, so guests from the Tequila will walk over to Playacar to use the Beach and pool. Very crowded at the beach. Need to \"reserve\" pool spot or beach spot by 8.am. Trade in your towels the night before to get a clean towel out early on you chaise. Money: Bring $1 and $5 bills - plenty. Many places will not give ANY change either in pesos or dollars. Riu PLaycar has a sign that says change only in pesos. There were items we didn't purchase because we weren't going to give a $5 for a $2.00 item. They do not accept USA coins. Rooms: Musty smell Damp - Never had such a smell on my belongings when I returned. Rooms clean and water is very hot. Should have listened to reviews and brought room freshener. At check in, we were told about the musty smell by the staff. Clean otherwise. Alcohol: I tried one type of alcohol in the room (a dispenser) and it was watered down. Drinks are not very strong but taste good. Bartenders are friendly. Photos: We made a special evening appointment with the hotel photographer and got really nice pictures of our family down at the beach at sunset. We tipped the photographer and paid the usual $6.00 for the pictures. Shuttle: none available to town. taxi ride is etiher 4 or 5 dollars each way. Short ride. Beach: small and eroded. Water was rough. Very very windy this time of year. Pool: adequate, but crowded. Bar fine. There were very very obnoxious guests (americans, unfortunately) who were in a crowd of about 20 and who were loud, rude and generally not family rated.

And we were given exacttly what we wanted after I slipped $20 to the reception person. We had to wait for about 3 hours for the room to be ready. it was a nice room, quite. but there is some smell in the room, luckely we brought the plug-in air freshners, which everyone recommended. they helped a little bit. we complained about the sewage smell to reception, they kept calling us and asking if everything was ok, but really nothing was done. if you keep the A/C on all the time, there is no smell, but it gets really cold in the room during the night. They clean your room every day. Remember to tip the cleaning pereson every day. The beds are hard, but the bigger problem for me were the pillows, which are flat and uncomfortable. There are palm trees on the beach, which we did not like, too small, crowded, bad beach erosion. We used Riu Palace beach. That hotel is much, much nicer. If you can spare a few more dollars, you better go to Riu Palace. That hotel is sobeautiful, much cleaner. In Riu Playacar there were a lot of senior citezens, like 65-70+. Not too many kids. Pool area was always too croweded, the kids pool smelled dirty. We used the pool at Riu Palace: much bigger, much cleaner. The food was ok. mostly all the same, boring. We had an early seating at 6:30 in the evening for dinner. Staff is nice, always smiling, trying to please you. The entertainment program is ok. nothing special. We could not wait to go back home. All in all, I would recommend this hotel if you are on a tight budget, or this is a last minute decision.

We had a great time! We are in our early thirties---and we found there are things to do for all ages. We arrived on a Thursday afternoon and we were immediatly greated (the second we got out of our shuttle) by someone to help us with our bags. We walked into a beautiful open lobby and were handed a welcome drink. The people at the front desk were helpful and friendly. We got to our room and our luggage was already there waiting for us. The landscaping is amazing--the beach area is breathtaking--the pool area is beautiful--the rooms and all of the buildings are incredably clean--the buildings where you eat and where the entertainment is are decorated beautifully(marble, granite, tile, chandaliers, hand painted murals). We went there to relax so we did not do alot of the activities. We went on the afternoon snorkling tour(highly recommend) where they take you out on a boat about fifteen minutes from the resort. Lasted about 1 1/2 hours, my husband went parasailing, and we did a little shopping. If you want to shop, there are plenty of places to go. Right across the street is a little shopping area where you can find everything. Playa del Carment is about a 5 minute cab ride. Beautiful town. There are lots of activies going on through out the dayat the resort. Spanish lesssons, sand volley ball, scuba lessons, bingo, water aerobics, dance lessons, snorkling, (all free) just to name a few. We took advantage of the pool(with swim up bar) and the great beach area. We can't say enough about how beautiful the beach is!! Very clean, amazing white sand, incredable clear water. The food is great-----and I am a very picky eater! I had no problems finding something at every meal. The menu is always changing so you don't get tired of the same things. The drinks were great. If you want the better tequilia in your drinks you just have to ask for it. The mini bar in the room was great to have. We enjoyed it alot!!!! The entertainment was good at night. So much to see. They really have alot of activities for the kids that stay there. They really include the kids in many things. We really can't say enough about the staff. So friendly, so helpful, just great.

This place is awesome!! If you are used to staying at the Ritz then this is not the place for you. If you are looking for a relaxing yet fun vacation for a very decent price then this is the place for you. We booked out trip thru Apple vacations and they were the best. All of our transportation to and from the airport was taken care of which made it so simple. There was a Apple rep in the hotel everyday to take care of anything we needed, including booking any side trips we wanted to go on. RESORT: The resort was beautiful!! The landscape was done to perfection. The pool area was nice although there was a strange odor coming from some sort of pool house back near the kiddie pool. So we just sat on the other side and problem solved. You need to get down to the pool rather early to get a chair at the pool, but we finally realized all we had to do is throw our towels down on chairs before we ate breakfast and nobody would move them. The towels provided for the beach and pool are not bad, but if you have the room in your suitcase you can always bring your own. ROOMS: I will say that there is definately a musty odor in the rooms, but like all the previous reviews I read before going we brought the plug-in air freshners and a few candles and it was fine. The AC in our room was ok it could have been a little cooler but after being in the room for awhile it was fine, Also keep in mind that the sliding doors to balcony are connected to the AC unit so if you have your door open for air the AC cuts off. The cleanliness of the room was excellent. If you need you bar stocked just ask a few dollars to the guy who is stocking definately did not hurt. FOOD & DRINK: This place is set-up for drinkers so if your not a big drinker this might not be the place for you. You will not find Budweiser anywhere inside the resort so if you want something other then the Corona then you will have tyo go and get it downtown. The frozen drinks are fine and there are so many to choose from try them until you find one you like. Don't be afraid to ask for more alcohol in your drink if you want it. True there are only a few \"top shelf\" liquors but we are only comparing it to what we are all used to. Try something different you are after all in a different country. As far as the buffet and your reservations it was simple the day we got there we were in the lobby saw a man coming out of the restaurant we stopped to ask and in two minutes he had us booked in for the whole week at the same table. We had the 8:30 dinner seating but found the crowd to be far less about 9:15 there was still plenty of food left and we never felt rushed. SERVICE: What can I say these people were all very friendly and took great care of us. They all work there butts off for very little money so tips are really appreciated and they deserve it. BEACH: The beach is breathtaking!!! Plenty of sun or shade!! The chairs work just like the pool throw your towels on them early and they will be there when you are ready. All in all this is a great resort that we would go back to in a minute. The price was right and we loved everything about it.

Go to the Playa DelCarmen/Mayan Rivera but Don't stay at the Rius. Bad service, bad food, bad attitude! My husband and I went to the Riu Playacar for our first anniversary and were Very disappointed. The service is terrible! It started the first night when we arrived late, around 9pm, and asked where we could get a bite to eat. We were told the El Porche was open to 10pm so we rushed across the lobby to the restaurant - we grabbed a couple of cold pieces of pizza and received many dirty looks when we were told they were trying to close up.... FYI: the brochure says 'snacks until 2am', 'snacks' = hot water for tea or coffee and popcorn was all we found... After our cold pizza we went to look at the beach in moon light and were surprised to not see any beach cabanas or palupas. We asked the front desk if any shelter was available (We're both fair and I was 3 months pregnant which means direct sun is Not a good idea). The nice 'host' said \"oh yes, in the morning all the beach chairs are set up and beach umbrellas are available\". There is NOT an umbrella on the premise (there are a few palupas around the pool). You can lay under Palm trees but be very aware of falling coconuts (I'm not kidding). The Riu staff will say Anything you want to hear to make you go away (a fact that was displayed again and again). Then to bed - the Hardest bed I've ever had the displeasure of sleeping on! Pillows - I've used thicker tissues! Every morning we woke up sore and with a beaten feeling. The food is boring and below average (I'm being kind, my husband would have a few more choice words I'm sure...) There is only one non-reservation restaurant for dinner, El Porche - an out-dated Miami/Golden Girls inspired restaurant with very limited seating outdoors (I didn't travel to eat in a depressing interior) - and you have to decide on the early seating or later seating and stick to that schedule. We were told if you ever want to change from late to early or visa versa \"no problem\" (again - say what the guest wants to hear so they go away). So, one night we wanted to eat early rather than our usual late seating and you'd swear we had asked to be hand-feed off golden platters. ATTITUDE! Then my husband found a hair in his food...not a good night! The \"2\" reservation restaurants - are actually the same place (by the beach). 1/2 the room is the steak menu, 1/2 is the seafood and No you can't mix the two/order from different menus (regardless if one you loves steak but the other loves fish). Both were ok, but the menu does Not change; same appetizer, starter, entr\u00e9e choices and same dessert EVERY night and the menu is also the same at the other Rius (the Yucatan and Tequila) you're allowed to dine at. Yet More Attitude: the night my husband found (a short and curly) hair in his \"freshly prepared\" food he complained to the waiter, who told us he'd speak to us boss...we waited...and waited...and waited...finally found the waiter and asked what was happening - nothing he said, he told his boss, that's it. We had had it! Ed went to the front desk, was shown to the manager's office. The manager listened, her response \"well, if you don't like it here you can go and stay some where else\"... UNBELIEVABLE. The worst customer service EVER. We didn't spend thousands of dollars to be treated like crap! There are more examples but I think you get the idea. I will never stay at a Riu and warn everyone I speak with not to trust the Riu name! We were in Aruba the year before for our honeymoon and stayed at a Wyndham - this chain I Would Highly recommend. My sister just came back from the Mayan (on our advice did not stay at any of the Rius) - they went to the Royal Hideaway (which we said looked beautiful from the beach) and could not Rave enough about the Hideaway - they said the staff in particular we Outstanding!

This was our first trip to a sun resort since our honeymoon 18 years ago, and we loved it. The resort was everything we could have asked for. ROOMS - Check in was quick and painless, 10 to 15 minutes. We asked for adjoining rooms, and got them. We stayed in rooms 4208 and 4209, which are are the second floor of one of the middle buildings, facing the center walkway. The rooms each had two double beds, pushed together. This worked out well because each person had their own bed. Friends who we met there had one room for the four of them (parents and 2 girls 13 &11) and they were cramped for space. Check out was lightning fast (30 seconds)! We had no phone calls and turned in our keys, safe locks and towel cards and they said thanks, you're done, please come again (basically). Each room had a desk/bureau with three drawers and two nightstands with 2 drawers each. This gave us planty of room to put away our clothes and other stuff. There was also a large closet with a room safe. Each room had a small table and two chairs, a 20\" color TV and a luggage table. One each balcony was two resin chairs and a resin end table. The bathroom had one vanity; the liquor dispensor with gin, vodka, tequila and rum; a mini-bar with pop, beer and water; a 4' by 4' shower with a handheld shower that could be adjusted to different heights; and the toilet which is behind its own door. The housekeeping staff kept the rooms spotless. We left $2.00 US in each room every day and we were greeted with some amazing towel designs, including mermaids, swans, elephants and babies. We left the rooms early, usually by 8:30, and our rooms were finished before noon everyday. The mini-bar was refilled every second day as promised. Our friends did have difficulty getting diet pepsi, but mostly because the person with the diet pepsi showed up at 10:00 pm as our friends were getting into bed. Regarding the various complaints we've read about the rooms: Yes, the beds are very firm and the pillows are thin, but by the end of the day we were all so tired we had no problems sleeping. We prefer firm beds anyways. Yes, the rooms did have a musty smell from the air conditioning, but it disappeared with 20 seconds of entering the room (at least that we noticed). The air conditioning worked fine, in fact some days we turned it down becuase our rooms got too cold. Our clothes did smell when we got home, but they all needed washing from the humidity, they came home damp. As for noise, we heard nothing, and I am a light sleeper! MEALS - The food was excellent! The breakfasts were amazing with eggs of every form, pancakes, french toast, omelettes, fruit, cereals, breads and other baking. They have a juice bar with 6 different juices, on top of your orange, pinapple, grapefruit and apple. The lunches were down by the pool and consisted of hot foods, salads, fruit, breads, burgers, hot dogs and pizza. There was pasta station with made-to-order pasta and self serve soft ice cream. The dinner buffets were in the main dining room. The entrees usually included two fish dishes; pork, chicken and beef; fajitas; burgers, hot dogs and pizza; the pasta station and a Mexican table. There was also a large salad bar and a large dessert bar. We ate at both of the a la carte restaurants, and they were both very good. The avocado appertizer at the Mediterranean was exquisite! The menus were limited, but the meals were excellent. As with most buffets, the food can get monotonous. Looking back, we think the problem was you take a little of everything every time, and thereby get tired of fish, chicken and pork every night. Trying sticking to one or two entrees per meal if you are there for two weeks. The staff in the restaurants were great. You do get an assigned table with an assigned seating for dinner, which suited us just fine. We liked it because you got the same waiter and they looked after you very well. Our only suggestion is that it would be nice to have a sandwich bar or station available for lunch. The breads were there, but some cold cuts, sliced cheeses, lettuce, tomatoes, sprouts etc. would make a nice change from all the other food. BARS - The three bars opened at 10:30 am and stayed open until midnight. The service was great and so was the selection. We had daquiris, margaritas, beer, mai-tais, screwdrivers, riviera mayas and just good old CC & 7. Yes they are served in small plastic cups during the day, but we brought the insulated mugs and they filled them right up. The drinks were not watered down, in fact some could use some watering down, and we never had a long wait at the bars. For those interested, they did have a dark beer at the bars, all you have to do is ask for \"cervesa negra\", otherwise you get corona. POOL & BEACH - The pool and the beach were amazing. Playacar is supposed to have calm water, but we had 3' to 4' waves for most of our stay. This was fun to play in, but as we found out, it covered most of our beach. Once the water calmed down. we have another 20' of beach in front of the hotel. The pools were great. We spent most of ur time around the pool without the bar because it was quieter and our kids are water rats. They kept the pools and pool area spotless. There was one fellow who spent all day cleaning leaves from the pool and other just sweeping and general housekeeping. They have lots of shade around the pool with these thatched umbrellas (palapas?) all over the place. They were building more all the time we were there. As for the beach, there are lots of palms to give minimal shade, or if you go behind the massage hut there is lots of shade. It also appeared that the erosion problem refered to in some reviews is healing itself. STAFF - The staff at the hotel are amazing. They are the friendliest and most fun-loving people I have ever met. We found them to be extremely helpful, although honestly, we didn't need a whole lot of help. They did arrange transport for us to Xel-ha, got us taxis into Playa Del Carmen and helped us with some minor issues. The animation staff were the best, friendly and they got you involved. We did air rifle, water volleyball, water polo, bracelet making, spanish lessons, scuba demo, bingo, and there was much more to do. GUESTS - Regarding the other guests, the only ones we had problems with were Americans, not all, but some. We realize you spent good money to get there, but so did everyone else. The ugly few were constantly butting in front of you at the bars, the buffet and even the front desk. Heaven forbid you give the person in front of you a foot of breathing space, because someone would push in, worse than rush hour! And the disrespect they showed the staff! You are a guest in their country! If I went to Texas or Florida or California and treated resort staff the way some did, I would get deported and Dubya would nuke Ottawa! Remember people, you're not at home, this isn't the Waldorf Astoriaand your not eating at a 5-star restaurant. Relax, enjoy and experience a different lifestyle. After all, that's what we're all there to do, and the staff is more than happy to help you acheive that goal! ACTIVITIES - As stated earlier, there are way to many to discuss. Just go and enjoy. Off the resort, we did go to Xel-ha. The kids swam with the dolphins, which was wonderful. The snorkeling however was every disappointing. The water was cloudy, the bottom sandy and we saw very few fish. Snorkeling down their river is also a little scary because your competing for space with the people floating down on the inner tubes. We also went snorkeling on a trip booked through the dive shop. They took us by boat about 15 minutes down the coast, just past Xcaret. We saw lots of fish and coral, very nice. Went to Playa Del Carmen twice. Shopping there is good. We had lunch at Carlos and Charlies - excellent! One note - the Kahlua in Playa runs aroudn $9 US for 750ml, I paid $13 for a liter at the airport. Do you own comparison shopping. Overall, would we return - yes!

We paid ~$2400 per couple (including air fare and transfers) through Worry Free Vacations. We never like to go to the same place twice, so we would likely not stay here again, however I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend it to friends. If you are looking for a very upscale, high class resort or a place with a lot of exciting nightlife, this resort isn\u2019t it, however it is a great upper-middle class resort with value for the money. ROOMS: Clean, basic, lots of closet space \u2013 never enough hangers, so we brought some. Beds are hard but didn\u2019t bother us too bad. Sheets and comforters are scratchy. There are some blankets in the closet that we put down on the bed and it made it softer. Bathroom area roomy. Toilet is separate with door from rest of bathroom. Large minifridge stocked every other day with 7up, orange soda, mineral water, 3 large bottles of water, 4 coronas, 2 pepsis. Mini bar had Jose Cuervo, and local rum, gin and vodka. If you run out, just call the front desk and they deliver more. The person who stocks the minifridge is a different person than the maid. Minifridge was usually restocked in the afternoon. We left a note of what we wanted. They have Diet Pepsi \u2013 called Pepsi Light if you ask for it. Floors are tile and slippery when wet. No problem with bugs, except a few mosquitos. Maid service was great. Brought a glade plug in, a small travel bottle of febreeze and a few drier sheets for drawers and the \u201cmusty\u201d smell of the tropics never bothered us. Room keys are on regular key fobs (piece of square plastic) so we put one key on the safe key lanyard and brought another key lanyard along so we could each have a key around our neck vs. having to have a pocket.

There was some construction at the resort next door, so I suggest you try NOT to get a room on the south side of these buildings \u2013 they seemed the noisiest. 5 is closest to the theater, so if you like quiet, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this one. Buildings 2, 4 and 6 are on north side of resort. We typically stay on the 2nd or 3rd floor at resorts, but stayed on the 1st floor this time and really liked it. We were in building 2, rooms 2105, 2106 and 2107 and they were quiet for the most part and close to the lobby. The resort was very clean, well groomed and the staff was constantly cleaning up. We never felt unsafe during the entire trip. We had no problems with theft. There are NO TIMESHARE salespeople at the RIU, which was a great. No workout facilities on site. INTERNET: There is a little computer room off of the lobby. $3 for 20 minutes of internet access. There is someone there to help you too since the keyboards are a little different than the US. BEACH: Yes, it has eroded but is still beautiful and plenty of room. You can no longer walk to the beach up to Playa del Carmen though, due to erosion farther north. You do need to go down and reserve a chair (throw a towel on it) fairly early as they chairs were mostly taken by 10 a.m. We stayed at the beach in the morning and the pool in the afternoons. There is no bar right on the beach, no beach wait staff service and no bathrooms really close by, so it is a little walk, but not a big deal and a way to walk off some of the calories! Some topless women. Speedos galore on men of all sizes too. SERVICE: Very good. We did tip a few bucks here and there and tipped the maid ~every other day, but really it wasn\u2019t necessary. Staff works hard. Animacion staff very energetic and always something going on. LIQUOR: Corona is what\u2019s on tap and in the minifridge. They also have 2 other beers at the bars \u2013 they are listed on the menus at the bars but I can\u2019t remember what they are - something like Negra or similar? Ask for top shelf liquor by name. No Jack Daniels or Captain Morgan available that we could find. They did have Baileys and some other top brands, although I did hear people say they didn\u2019t have any really high end quality liquors. They did have Jim Beam and a ton of Tequilas, etc. We didn\u2019t find the drinks watered down \u2013 quite the opposite. If you want more liquor in your drink, just ask. The wine is not top quality wine and was dry, but is ok. The guys in our group drink Budweiser, so we went into Playa del Carmen one day and bought a case of Bud to bring back. There are several little mini marts in Playa del Carmen and you can find Bud and other brands for ~$1 a can. SHOPPING: There is a small plaza right across from the resort. Playa del Carmen is only a ~$4 cab ride (20 minute walk) north of the resort. We also went to Cozumel for a day and our friends said the shopping there was much better than in Playa del Carmen. Playa seemed to have a lot of little shops all peddling the same line of touristy goods and not very good quality. FOOD/RESTAURANTS: Great buffets. Something for everyone. Always many choices. But after 7 days, no matter how wide a variety, buffets get somewhat tiring, so you can always go into town for a meal. Lunch buffet was the weakest, but still lots of variety and good food. If you are looking for high end seafood, etc. you likely would be disappointed. My friends said the \u201cfancy desserts\u201d (cheesecake, etc.) weren\u2019t very good. Steakhouse \u2013 ok; not Midwest quality beef but a nice change. Didn\u2019t try the Mediterranean restaurant, but didn\u2019t see anything too spectacular on that menu. One main drawback to this resort is you have to choose the 6:30 or 8:30 seating time and stick to it all week. The buffet can get to be a madhouse so we found if we waited until ~7:15 it was better. DRESS CODE: Men are supposed to wear slacks to dinner, but we found nice shorts were accepted in the buffet with a shirt with sleeves, which was great. HEALTH: Most of us got mild diarrhea at some point, but in all honesty that was because we ate and drank too much. The oily \u201cfoofy\u201d drinks such as pina colada, Miami vice, etc. are great, but if you drink 10 of them it is to be expected that you will get a little tummy upset. No serious stomach problems though. POOL/BARS: Two separate pools \u2013 1 with swim up bar and a separate one more for relaxing. We loved the swim up bar in the afternoons. Bring an insulated mug since the glasses they use are tiny. I don\u2019t think if I had small children I would let them swim in this pool in late afternoon \u2013 it is a swim up bar pool and the bathroom is a little ways away, so you get the picture. Resort doesn\u2019t have floaties but you can buy in the gift shop, in Playa, or pack one. Pool is shallow enough to stand in (I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d). My husband was disappointed there weren\u2019t any \u201ctheme\u201d bars at the resort \u2013 i.e. no piano bar, sports bar but there were still plenty of options. SHOWS: Micheal Jackson show was good. Others we heard were not Vegas quality, but ok for something to do. Shows don\u2019t start till 10 p.m. There is usually some type of kids show before the 10 p.m. show. EXCURSIONS: Xel-Ha was great. Get the all-inclusive plan \u2013 worth the money. We ate at the Mexican restaurant there and it was very good. We did \u201cDiscover Scuba diving\u201d through the Scuba Caribe dive shop at the resort and had a great time. It was $130 per person and we got to do 2 dives and they take you out right from the resort. Be sure to be aware of their refund policy. One couple with us wasn\u2019t able to complete the diving, but couldn\u2019t get their money back. They did let 1 friend go on the snorkel trip instead though. If you are adventurous, you might want to go to Mezcalitos beach club on the far east side of Cozumel and try the ring toss game and get your picture taken at the \u201cNaked Beach\u201d sign\u2026.not recommended for kids. If you go to Cozumel and rent scooters, beware\u2026driving is reckless and you are taking your life into your own hands. Our group rides motorcycles and said you couldn\u2019t pay us to rent scooters over there! GENERAL COMMENTS: Bring comfortable shoes and light weight clothes that you can layer if needed. Visit mapchick before you go for tips and they also have great maps of Playa, Cozumel, Cancun, Riviera Maya. Take lots of small bills - $1\u2019s, 5\u2019s etc. for tips or buying stuff \u2013 no one ever seems to have change except pesos. LEAVING: Cancun airport \u2013 long lines, lots of waiting, they randomly pick people to search luggage by hand; outrageously high prices ($3.50 for bottle of water; $1.80 candy bar). Bring a bottle of water with you and eat before you get to the airport.

We are so excited to be going back to \"paradise.\" I've read so many reviews and can hardly believe what I read, the food is poor, the rooms smell musty, the service was not what you pay for, the pool is nasty, the drinks are watered down, yada yada yada! I can assure you this, if you are an average couple with a 70,000 to 80,000/yr income, who are not too good and snooty to enjoy life, then this is the place for you! I can only think these bad reviews are from people who are use to extravagant vacations with an extravagant budget. This is a fantastic package at a fantastic price. The resort is breathtaking, the sand is so white and the water so aqua. Everyone at the resort will bend over backwards to help get you what you need/want. The food is delish, morning, noon and night! The rooms may smell a little musty but remember where you are \"THE BEACH!\" they smell musty in Myrtle Beach and in Florida too. The service was awesome, as soon as you are done with your plate, someone is there to take it away. At no time do you see any of the workers slacking, they are the hardest working people I've ever encountered, my husband and I recognized that on our first trip. As far as the pool goes, each and every morning as soon as the sun comes up the staff is out cleaning, mowing, raking, and setting things up for YOUR enjoyment, not one time could I say the pool needed cleaning....maybe some leaves would blow in but that's about it! The drinks are fixed exactly as requested. My husband and I drink rum and coke, all you do is order it, they pour till you say when and fill the rest up with coke. TIP, TIP, TIP, REMEMBER, these people make $17.00 US dollars a day, they work long hard shifts, 6 days a week! They don't expect a tip, but appreciat it very much if you do.

Lunch is a typical buffet, again, with more choices than you will know what to do with. The guacomole and tortilla chips come highly recommended. For dinner, you can either choose a buffet, or the Mediterranean Restuarant or Steak House Restuarant. The Steak House is great, with a wonderful show when they serve the baked alaska for dessert. The booze is pretty good. They have Corona on tap and the mixed drinks seemed strong enough. If you want high end alcohol, just ask for it. The bars don't tend to be too busy, and the drinks were quite easy to get. The only problem I ran into was a scam one night when I was walking on the beach. A guuy dressed in a security uniform told me I needed to give him 40 dollars to walk there. When I wouldn't give it to him, he tried to follow me, but I got in his face, and he backed off. Not trying to scare anyone, just be aware so you don't get taken for a ride, so to speak. Also, be aware of the nude European sunbathers, they can take you by surprise.

We went through APPLE VACATIONS and our entire all-inclusive stay with airfare out of Charlotte, NC, was less than $2000 for both of us! Wow! So you have an idea of our \"tastes\" to base this review on, we spend our honeymoon at Sandals/Beaches Royal Plantation in Jamaica, and have stayed in places like Spanish Bay at Pebble Beach. But we also have enjoyed taking weekend trips to Myrtle Beach and camping in the mountains. Here are the highlights: GETTING THERE: It is about a 45 minute ride from the Cancun Airport - through Apple Vacations (or others), they provide included transport in nice vehicles. EASY! CHECKING IN: Somewhat chaotic if a lot of people are checking in/out but they do serve a cold beverage. The staff was friendly. SCENERY: Breathtaking! It is a lucious resort with plenty of tropical plants and great landscaping. BEAUTIFUL!!! ROOMS: Unique with 12X12 tile floors and an bathroom area separated with a curtain. (Toilet area does have a door) The king bed is two doubles pushed together and is very hard. It wasn't great, but we kept telling ourselves, it was only $2000 for the whole package! There is A/C unit that is only on while you are in the room but when it worked, it kept it really cool. The balcony was great, but NONE OF THE ROOMS ARE DIRECTLY ON THE OCEAN. We didn't spend much time in our room, so it wasn't a big deal, but thought you all would appreciate knowing. STAFF: Fantastic! This was the best part of the resort. Everyone was so hospitable and willing to help us. In the morning, you give the great guys at the towel kiosk your \"towel ticket\" and they give you a towel. In the afternoon, you give back your dirty ones and they give you your ticket back. So you really get to know these guys and they are a ball of fun! The \"fun staff\" (the ones that try to get the guests involved with stuff) are great - they give you great suggestions on things to do in the area based on your interests. BEACH: It's as if you are sitting in a postcard! You can see from the pictures that people posted, it's a vast area with tons of palm trees to sit under for shade. The water is warm and gorgeous. And the sand is perfectly white and beautiful! BEACH ACTIVITIES: They had volleyball all day long and salsa lessons & Bingo in the afternoons at the pool area. There was always something to do if you wanted to do it. You can also use the sea kayaks and catamarans for free. Fun! You can charter snorkel trips from the resort too. We had a ball on our trip - the ocean was unusually rough, but it was such an adventure on the boat! Worth the money. My husband would probably add that another \"beach activity\" is people watching - the Riu resorts are very popular with Europeans which we thought was GREAT because it added to the experience - we met a lot of really fascinating people! Some women are topless and the men where tiny little things. No biggie to us, but thought you might be interested to know. OTHER ACTIVITIES: They had shows each night at the Playacar and the Tequila across the street. They were entertaining and everyone seemed to really enjoy it. There is a \"disco\" at the Tequila which was quite fun. The town of Playa is just a 5 minute/$5 cab ride away. There is very upscale shopping and great bars and restaurants equipped with mariache bands and all! FOOD: Available available for all meals is a buffet that was good. The lunch buffet is outside and has some of the best guacomole ever! Breakfast was great each morning outside! (It's also available inside in the A/C - no worries.) For dinner, you are assigned a table after you check in and you're supposed to sit there each time. Depending on how crowded they are depends on how strict they are.We tried the Steak House - wasn't great, but wasn't bad either. You have to have separate reservations for the non-buffet reservations. No big deal though. BARS: We thought they were great! We also didn't go to the Playacar to get 30 year old Scotch. :) We tried dozens of different fruity drinks, margaritas, and simple Rum & Cokes. We definitely tried plenty of tequilas at the different bars. The swim-up pool bar was great! Overall, it was a GREAT trip for the money. If we had spent $4000, we would have been supremely disappointed. But we didn't and REALLY enjoyed ourselves and have recommended it to tons of people.

We agonized over where to stay since we read so many mixed reviews of too many resorts. So after taking the plunge, here is a topline of our experience: FOOD - moderate to poor. Expect buffet for all dining experiences with the exception of two nights in which you can get a reservation for a sit down meal. If you go on vacation to be waited on , this is NOT your place. Typical buffet food- pizza, spaghetti, cheeses, breads, salad bar. Do not expect any regional or authentic mexican food ironically! Thank god for tortilla chips and guacamole. No room service either. The only food available in between dining service is popcorn and a bad nacho machine - imagine a cheese pump nacho case from a football game. If you are looking for late night munching after drinking, forget it. NOTHING but the bad popcorn and faux nachos. BUT the breakfast buffet is GREAT. Tons of options and fresh fruit blended into smoothies. And there are awesome espresso machines that are self serve and serve great cappaccino's and latte's. We ventured downtown and found some great spots for food since we couldn't stand to do dinner in our place one more night. BOOZE - This is an area in which no one went into detail on the reviews and wish I had know the real deal. The only beer available is Corona ON TAP. And it tastes pretty bad. They do stock the mini bar with a few Corona bottles which is nice. There are no servers around the pool area or beach serving drinks - you'll have to get up off your chair and get your own drink. Very very few name brand alcohols - ONLY if you ask you can get basic Bacardi in the mixed/blended drinks. And there is Cuervo. If you are a Vodka drinker, you are out of luck. The only vodka available is Smirnoff or some scary local brand and it is grim. Bring an insulated mug for drinks - the glasses they serve drinks in are tiny. The blended drinks all taste the same , bad syrup-ey mixes without any fresh fruit in them at all. Also, no clubs or \"disco's\" on site. Any partying has to be done off site, downtown PDC or another Rui resort close by. SERVICE - GREAT. Everyone there was incredibly cheerful and very helpful if you had a question or special need. Definitely tip please! They work LONG hours and have to put up with a lot of crazy demanding tourists. Even on our last day, the front desk ran around to find us to let us know our flight was delayed. ROOM - I thought it was fine - although beds are harder than rocks. Ask for a north building room - much quieter . And our north facing room had a super private patio over looking the grounds without any obstruction of other buildings/rooms. BRING an air freshener - the plug in kind that runs all the time. Rooms are very musty and will quickly seep into all of your belongings. POOL - lots of sun space around pool. And big pool too. Tons of chairs - but you do have to get up pretty early to get one right by the pool in a area with lots of sun. They go quickly. If you are the type of person who will eat anything and doesn't mind lower rank alcohol, this could be a great destination and a great value. But if you are looking for a place to be pampered and served with great food and top shelf alcohol, then an all inclusive is definitely NOT the way to go.", "Date": "April 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Upper Michigan", "Title": "\u201cMoney stolen\u201d", "Author": "Yooper54", "ReviewID": "UR3316527", "Content": "We stayed at the Riu Playacar and we were having a wonderful time until we discovered that money was missing from our room safe.

We had our 2 children (23 and 19) with us. Our rooms were very nice -clean, spacious, nice furniture, beautiful balcony!

The Riu Playacar was smaller than most of the resorts we saw but it was on the beach and was very close to walk to from our room. We actually liked that it was smaller than some others we saw. Alot less crowded. There were no oceanfront rooms but we had a room on the first floor facing the main walkway near the beach. The room was nice and clean but what we didn't like and it was a problem was the shower and the sink drains didn't work well at all.

The beach was pretty with all the palm trees for the shaded areas and there were lots of chairs this was never a problem.Down by the water the beach was much smaller here. We were told that their had been beach erosion making the beach much smaller than it had been. We did notice a few times that some trees had fallen in the ocean. Also wanted to mention that there are topless sunbathers all over the beaches incase you have a young family and are not accustomed to this. We thought the blue aqua colored water was simply breathtaking. You can also look across and see Cozumel.

See also my review to Barcelo Maya. I liked the Barcelo better for many reasons, although I would definitely return to the \u201cPlayacar\u201d area, just not to this particular RIU resort. Great time, we absolutely LOVE Mexico. We love the people, the service, the weather, the Mayan Riveria, the food. It is very interesting to go to two resorts in one week. They were SO different but both very good. We got married at Barcelo Maya on March 4 and spent our \u201choneymoon\u201d at Riu Playacar the following week. I don\u2019t consider the flight etc. to be a crucial part of the experience, but I know other travellers have complained. We travelled with Sunquest/Skyservice and were very impressed. Excellent service on board both ways and on time both ways. First let me say that this resort was VERY VERY crowded. Maybe it seemed more so after coming from the HUGE Barcelo, but it was quite a shock. Also, the average age of this clientele seemed older (55+?). Pros: Excellent food at buffet restaurant. Generally we found the food better than Barcelo. Better bar service also. Great to have the choice of 3 resorts to go to (Playacar, Tequila, Yucatan), we loved the atmosphere at the lobby bar of Riu Tequila and the shows. Fantastic activities staff. Location is great, you can walk to playacar village (1 min) and Playa del Carmen (10 min--$4 cab ride); Very clean rooms; mini bar in room was good; Shows were very entertaining; they seemed to have lots of variety and fun things for all ages. We were there on our honeymoon, so we kind of expected a bit of a to-do. The front desk staff were indifferent. We got balloons and a swan towel animal in our room. So finally on Wednesday, I decided to complain to the Sunquest rep. Not that I need another fruit basket and a bottle of tequila, but it is kind of the principle that Sunquest advertises that you get some kind of special \u201ctreatment\u201d at the resort on your honeymoon. So the same day we got a mexican figurine, a letter and a bottle of tequila delivered to our room. Cons: Not great choices for a la carte restaurants, same menu for the whole week, not a lot of choices, not a great atmosphere. The resort in general was WAY too crowded. Compared to Barcelo, I did not find this relaxing at all, but I think the entire area (playacar) seemed crowded. Lots of drunk 40 and 50 year old people. We are 34 and were dismayed with the lack of \u201cclass\u201d shall I say of some of the clientele\u2014tank tops and cut off shorts at dinner? Please. Lots of smokers; Pool was dirty, needs a good cleaning and paint job, could have felt dirty due to the # of (intoxicated) people in it every day; small crowded beach, it seems that Playacar has experienced some beach erosion lately, disappointing. Very young crowd (18?) at disco. Riu Playacar has received complaints in the past about the safe etc. It is a very outdated system. Your room KEY (not card) has your room # printed on it, and you get a KEY (not a code) for the safe. We found this very surprising and a definite security concern. No robes, no coffeemaker in room. Had to call 3 times (3pm, 9pm, and 11pm) to get extra towels on our first day (after that episode the service was much better). In general the atmosphere of RIU Playacar was an older crowd and a definite weird mix of people. I don\u2019t mean to sound like a snob, but I found some of the guests a bit trashy. We did meet some nice people at the RIU Tequila and liked the people/atmosphere there a lot better. It says clearly at the front door of the restaurant and in the brochure in the room that you are supposed to wear pants to dinner, but this was never enforced by the staff. I guess I expect since I am not in university on spring break that I wouldn\u2019t have to sit next to drunk guys smoking in tank tops at dinner\u2026but to each his own and everyone has a different idea of vacation. Maybe my feelings about this were enhanced because it seemed so crowded. Who knows. I think the RIU is a good company and we definately would return to a RIU resort, just not this one. It was way too crowded to be relaxing, felt like spring break for 50 year olds! I do like the Playacar area for sure, it is really too bad about the beach erosion was really sad. In general it was a 4 + star resort if it was 50% full.", "Date": "March 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "winnipeg", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel was 'just right'!\u201d", "Author": "winnipegirl", "ReviewID": "UR3270610", "Content": "Well, I've been home a week now and miss it terribly. I certainly would not want to write a review that would come off negative in any way because we were treated so well by all the staff and had an absolutely fabulous time. I think it is the staff that makes your stay so special here. I loved the size of the hotel-not too big, not too small-JUST RIGHT! We were so close to PDC, cab fare was cheap $4-$5-we went into town 3 times after dinner. This is a MUST! PDC is so incredibly beautiful in the evening. My concerns were: Lack of oceanview- We didn't get one but I think even if we had, there would not have been much view due to trees obstructing the views and distance. We had walkway view, it was lovely and quiet. Smells in room- we were on second floor and there was some odor coming from the shower drain. I kept it covered with a towel. You get used to it aftera while. Didn't affect our enjoyment of room at all. Hard beds-we put towels or extra blanket under our fitted sheet and it gave us just enough cushion to sleep comfortably. When the maids did our rooms, they left them there for us. We were travelling with a group of six and no one complained about bad sleeps. Condition of beach-as disappointing as it was to see the beach eaten away, we just pulled chairs down by the water or staked out front row (cliff-side) early in am. Still had fun boogie boarding and swimming. Be careful on the north side of Playacar beach (to the left) there was some hard exposed coral. None of the above affected our stay in any way. Everyone's different so what is important to one person may not be to another. Food-All six of us thought the food was fabulous! No one in our group had any issues with illlness. We ate at both the Steakhouse and Mediterranean-loved them both! The salmon at the Mediterannean was our favorite. I enjoyed the skewered steak/shrimp at Steakhouse. The meals exceeded our expectations. NOTE: you can not be late for specialty restaurants-6:30 or 8:30 sharp or else! We had a straggler and were told order now or too late! This was at about 7pm. They have everything timed precisely with the 2 sittings. As for buffet you can arrive late but you must be done by 8 pm for the 6:30 sitting and 10 pm for the 8:30 sitting. I found the latter timeslot was less rushed. Staff-the sweetest, friendliest you could ever meet. Too numerous to mention all. Israel (babyface) really stood out as he was always poolside encouraging us to join him for activities. The only negative experience was when we arrived and were informed that we were being bumped to the Tequila for 1 night. They did compensate us for the downgrade but we had several in our party coming at different times and we had to walk back and forth each time a new person arrived. Of course this was in the rain! Our feet were quite sore and we didn't get settled until dinnertime the next day into the Playacar. Kind of took 2 days off our holiday. We were upset that we were told to leave the Tequila by noon but could not check back into Playacar until 3 or 4pm. I think the proper thing to do would be let us have the rooms we were in until the other rooms were ready. On day 2 of our holiday, we were living out of suitcases in the lobby. This is the only reason that I rated this experience as a 4 out of 5. Otherwise it would have been a solid 5. The front desk was very apologetic and did try to make up for it during the rest of our stay. Sum it up-the layout of the resort is great-especially if you don't like hoofing it for miles and miles. Excellent size for seniors or those with small kids. Everything was top notch. I wouldn't go for a 3rd floor room myself-too many stairs. Check out all the other resorts have to offer-Tequila has neat character and pool area and Yucatan had the best beach.

Most remarks we have read on this site to date have been true - based on our observations and taste. Specifically: 1) The rooms have a very musty smell and your clothes will reak quickly. An air freshener is a must. 2) The beds are very hard. Strongly encourage to request additional pillows because those provided are thin and don't provide much cussion. 3) The food was OK at best. I strongly encourage you to try the other dining options available at the RIU Tequila and Yucatan and frequent the one that works best for you. The steak house and mediterrian dinner restaurants at the Playacar we felt were better than the buffets, but require reservations. 4) The staff was extremely accomodating (maid service, front desk, bar staff, servers, etc.) and aimed to please. We never had to wait long for food, drinks, extra towels, etc. 5) The beach in front of the resort is falling into the ocean and it doesn't appear the resort is doing much to curb this such as sandbagging which many other resorts have done. If a spacious beach to play/lounge is a must, you may want to consider another resort apx. 1/2 mile south down the beach - especially if you have children. 6) The resort does have both a pool area and sandy area underneath palm trees which are very nice, but provide a lot of shade. We found ourselves constantly adjusting our chairs because we didn't get down to the beach early enough to reserve a chair with direct access to the sun. 7) Bring a large insulated glass. The drink glasses they provide are small. 8) Bring your tennis racket! The courts are in decent shape and we rarely had to share the court with anyone. 9) The rooms do have a mini-bar and fridge stocked with water, pepsi products, bottles of Corona, etc. Nice touch. 10) This is an older persons crowd. Stay elsewhere if you want to party till 4:00 am with teenagers and twenty somethings. 11) Lastly you will find women sunbathing with their tops off.

We arrived and were informed they had overbooked and they had changed our reservation to the Riu Yucatan. Were told at first it was the same but larger and later that it was more expensive. When I was researching I chose not to stay at the Yucatan because it was larger, was about to get renovated and because the pool appeared to be very small for the size of the resort. I told them before asking for anything else, I chose NOT to stay at the Yucatan that I ahd booked for the Playacar. Basically they were like, \"sorry, it is what it is. You can stay at the Yucatan\". Not trying to be too pushy, seriously - I wasn't being obnoxious, I asked about if it was possible to upgrade us to a suite or the Palace which was the only other Riu we had considered since we weren't being provided what I had paid for. Was told, no, we can only send you to the Yucatan in a standard room. So at arrival, felt like I had been duped by travel agent or apple or the riu chain. Was disappointed. I will say, we were greeted with a drink promptly and the people were nice, but not very helpful or understanding. The apple rep was useless in helping us, didn't even try. I guess I am spoiled when you are bumped in the US they typically do something to comepensate you...upgrade, free night, something.... but it just didn't happen. I know, I was in another country, but still felt like I paid for something upfront and then was changed. I was only there for 5 days and decided to just spend my vacation enjoying the beach whereever I was rather than spend time on the phone with my travel agent or the apple rep. Happily, the property at the Yucatan was beautiful and they did put us next to our friends in rooms right off the pool. The furniture itself in the room was akin to a motel - but we didn't spend alot of time there so it wasn't too bad. I can't say what it was compared to Playacar, though I know the layout is quite similar. the beach at the Yucatan is MUCH better. Playacar erosion is like a 5-6 foot drop to the water - Yucatan is a sloping 2 feet, so it had that working for it. I saw a sign at the pool the second day we were there \"ask us about upgrading to the Riu Palace in Cancun\". That was never offered, had it been we probably would have taken it - because it was also one of our considerations. I just don't get why they didn't tell us that at the desk at check in. Especially since it was around 6 and too late for beach time or activities. I didn't want to sacrifice any of our vacation later which is why chose not to, just don't understand why wasn't offered. So if you book for the playacar, be forewarned, from talking to others at property they overbook and you really don't have much of a choice of where they put you. I will review the Yucatan over on its page.

I had read many reviews before going and admit that I was still a little leary about my choice. Don't get me wrong, I have stayed in Cancun many times and can have fun at a 2 star as much as a 5 star, but the couple we went with were used to a little more upscale and not so commercialized. That is why we chose to go further south this time. The resort was beautiful! Lots of fun around the pool or relax on the beach. Go topless if you want! Food was good. Nice choices at the buffets. Sit down service was very slow but food was good. The disco at the Tequila was great the first night we were there but not so busy after that. We never really ate or went to the beach at the other RIU's but did go see them and I was not disappointed in our choice. The other couple, they said they would go back in a minute! Did not see any shows except the Michael Jackson show at the Tequila our first night. Went into town for the first half of the Superbowl and then back to the hotel to watch the rest on the big screen down by the pool. We got tired of drinkin Corona draft or bottle from the minifridge so the last full day the guys went tok a taxi to Wallmart and brought back a cooler with 2 cases of BudLight. We were in heaven that last day by the pool. I think we could have sold them for $5 a piece if we wanted! Not that we all drink Budlight but that seemed to be the only American beer available. The week went by entirely too fast. My only bad experience was that I wanted to book a snorkel trip to Xel-Ha and our Apple rep said it would be too crowded and said we would enjoy the Mayan tour more. We spent most of our time in vans traveling to the three snorkel sites. One was in a cave and was quite interesting but the water was freezing. We spent at least 40 minutes between each of the three sites. Next time I will insist on what I want to do. One thing that worried me was the smell in the rooms that other reviews referred to.

We booked a room at the riu tequila which is across the street from the playacar. They told us that they were overbooked and offered to move us to the playacar (which is on the beach). We took the offer so we could be closer to the beach. The riu tequila looks a lot better than the playacar, but we were not on vacation to look at lobby's etc. The room we received had a very strong musty odor, so we whipped out our air freshener and took care of that (not fully). The beds in the riu playacar are so hard and uncomfortable that my back was aching after two nights of prisoner style sleep. The food at the playacar is below average, not very good at all. The beach has sustained substantial damage from the hurricane season, so what you get is a lot of sand leading to the ocean, then a 3 foot drop to the ocean. Not ideal. The entertainment was pretty good. Don't expect a Vegas show. The guest consisted of a lot of southern Americans, candaians, and Europeans. Some of the guests are loud and obnoxious which lends to the sub-par hotel making the whole trip feel a little trashy.

Our biggest compliment is to the staff, they were absolutely incredible. Josef even climbed a palm tree for us and knocked down fresh coconuts, and opened them so we could have a taste! Sergio kept a tight reign on his animacion staff and they were great. Jesus gave us great service at breakfast each morning with an enthusiastic Hola and a carafe of coffee. These people worked from 7 AM through the dinner hour and late evening, tips were greatly appreciated and well earned! The \"Grease\" show was fun for all ages and we had a great time at that. The disco at the Tequila was fabulous on Thursday night, but seemed to cater to more of a local crowd on Saturday night. We also tried the disco at the Yucatan on Saturday and we were the only people there and they never dimmed the lights. One great thing was the burgers and hot dogs outside the Tequila disco at night! They are just to your right as you come out of the disco. The pools were a little cool, but that didn't bother us, it was a lot warmer than we'd have back home! The drinks were great and the bartenders were more than happy to accomodate any strength or any concoction you might ask them to create for you! Rudolfo at the Yucatan pool bar was wonderful. There are many activities offered each day and you can participate if you'd like, but you are not pushed into it by any means. The beach erosion was very sad, but it didn't keep us from getting sun on the beach. The one excursion we did was the Snorkeling Adventure. What a great day! Everyone had so much fun swimming with the fish, even seeing barracudas, and looking at the reef. Noah was our snorkeling guide and he would jump in the water and grab sea cucumbers for us to look at and starfish. It was fun. It was located directly next to a nude resort which gave us quite a laugh to see some naked buns out windsurfing! I highly recommend the Riu Playacar. We took our own insulated mugs from home and had people offering big money for them. They are great to have on the beach with you!

This is our 2nd time in Playa Del Carmen. We loved it in 2004 and wanted to return. We stayed at the Reef Club the first trip; wanted a step up in service and accommodations and definitely experienced that at the Riu. We arrived and were greeted at the front desk with delicious, cold fruit drinks. (YUM) A great start! The buildings are plantation style with three stories. A main walkway splits the two sets of buildings, at one end is the beach, the other is the lobby entrance. The buildings are painted in cool colors of green, blue, pink... and others. Palm trees and clean, well-manicured grounds are featured. The pathway seperates the \"exercise\" pool and the stage, then the buffet/restaurant area and the \"drinking\" pool (with the swim up bar). Continuing toward the ocean, the path becomes a large sandy area with hundreds of palm trees & beach chairs. Beyond that, BEAUTIFULLY CLEAR ocean and great views of Cozumel lights and large passing ships. Having been in pdc in 2004, we immediately noticed that the beach has disappeared at the Riu and other properties. What used to be a LARGE (40 ft?) expanse from the raised beach chair area to the water, is now gone. The water is starting to erode the raised beach area and the roots of the first row of palm trees are often exposed each morning. Neighboring hotels (the Allegro, Reef Club, others) had been almost entirely washed out. Their former beaches now have numerous (ugly) sandbags and staffs were constructing stairways in order their guests could get down to the water from their hotel. Many of those properties seemed to be teetering on the edge of falling into the ocean, and we witnessed a few palm trees that were uprooted and laying down. Eeek! We were told by staff at the Riu that this happens every couple of years. We also heard that it was the result of recent hurricanes. Drunk people were saying it was tsunami related. We walked on the beach in both directions and would recommend to beach lovers to stay at the Iberostar or other property SOUTH of the Riu Playacar as they still have lots of beach left. The aesthetics of the beach are trashed with the presence of printed blue and red rice sacks containing sand. We stayed in room 2117, the green building, closest to the lobby. Facing the north side (opposite of the main path) we enjoyed the building and our room. We primarily drank at the lobby bar (Alejandro is the best!) and it was an easy stumble home and to breakfast in the AM. The rooms are nice. We experienced two problems which were resolved while we were there -- our showerhead squirted water ACROSS the room into the closet, and our fridge stopped working. I asked our package sale person (Sebastian) to translate the issue to the staff, told the person who called to see how our room was and finally the issue was addressed on day 3 when I spoke to a person at the front desk. The fridge issue was resolved on our day 6. Maid service was excellent. Each day we were greeted with towel animals. I tried to leave pesos for the staff but the $$ was left untouched on the bureau. The in-room bar (four dispensable bottles of alcohol) went almost untouched. It's nice to have, but we just went to the always-open lobby bar for any hard beverage needs. The fridge's contents, water, pepsis and 7ups are awesome to have. Staff refills the fridges every couple of days. We'd emptied our fridge by day 4 and requested refilling. Maid service doesn't refill as they came and no beverages did; when I saw the cart of beverages at the next building I asked the gents to refill us and they were kind enough to do it immediately (on day 6). The bed setup in the room is unique. Two double-sized beds are in the room pushed together. Extra blankets were available in the closet. The one thing I noticed about the bed is that they have some kind of plastic liner under the bottom sheet. It can make the bed rather toasty, even sweaty. One thing we missed was the presence of a bathtub. The shower is decent sized, and water pressure is excellent. We just both like to soak. Having a patio facing away from the main walkway is great -- private, quiet and relaxing. We found the food to be very good. We adjusted to their policy of a set dinner hour by snacking on chips and guacamole at the lower restaurant that serves lunch nearly all day. We ate at the reservations-only, full service steakhouse which featured a multi-course meal that was good, not exceptional. I thought the steak was great, but their attempts to mass cook side dishes (ie twice baked potatoes) makes it less fresh. REGRET: No Mexican Coffees!!! We saw people having them made but didn't know how/if we could order one. We were never offered that. I say, ASK! Beverages were plentiful at the Riu as they should be. I'm impressed how many name brand alcohols they're using and the adeptness of the staff to handle so many people so kindly and efficiently. Their staff brought out HUGE trays of drinks for the people in the beach area. That was super nice too. REGRET: I wished we'd listed to previous customers and brought big insulated cups to enjoy the cocktails while sunbathing. It seems stupid but even if it's for water, it's nice to have help to keep it cold. Visitor ages at the Riu Playacar seemed to skew higher than other places we've stayed. While there were many families with kids under teenage years, I would say people in their late 20s were the youngest adults. Lots of Candians, French, German, Dutch and English folks. (and they're all lucky enough to be there for TWO weeks!!!) Americans seemed like a minority...that was nice. Children and parents alike seemed really happy at the Riu Playacar. Staff was fun and each day there were lots of activities. I enjoyed the daily water polo with \"kids\" of all ages. We took advantage of the Riu opportunity to view and use the other Rius. Though we didn't go to the Palace (we heard contradicting stories as to whether we're allowed), we danced and drank at the Tequila. They have a fun danceclub, though it can go a bit techno. The Yucatan looked AWESOME -- the facility was quieter and bigger. Peeping in, the room layouts seemed identical. We took two excursions and would recommend them both. TRIP ONE: We snorkeled at Point (Ponte?) Morelos one morning. The snorkeling was on a beautiful reef a half hour north of PDC. We were back by noon. WARNING: Though our package dude Sebastian didn't tell us, they require that you use BIODEGRADABLE sunscreen ($10/bottle) and charge you a couple bucks a head to get in to the park. BRING MONEY! TRIP TWO: XCaret. One word: Fabulous! We floated through the underground caverns, watched the dolphins, had margaritas at the top of the point (which is VERY windy.. a definite no-hairpiece location), saw numerous amazing animals... all terrific. The big thing is that you DO NOT need to go on a tour. $10 taxi rides take you to the park. It's $49/piece to get in (we bought it through the hotel in the hopes of avoiding the line. No, you still have to wait for the slowpokes to buy their tix) and you can be on your own schedule. The beach is beautiful, the whole place is a can't-miss. We actually took a bunch of walking trips downtown to Playa del Carmen. (It's a 25 minute walk to the southern most area of the downtown) We thoroughly enjoy strolling down the street there and enjoying cocktails in the open-air restaurants. We did note that \"Americanization\" has sprung over the last year. The shopping malls are more like the suburbs...there's 3 Haagen Dasz' and two Diesel Jeans places, a TGIFridays -- eek. I hope it doesn't change too much! We enjoyed the Riu Playacar and would certainly consider returning. As lame as this may sound, the two items I was diappointed by were the lack of bathtub and the plastic beds. If you're going, enjoy it!

Surrounding hotels that I have stayed at (ex: Ibero Star, RIU Tequilla) were beautiful and the RIU palace looked like a weak attempt at replicating a Washington DC tourist stop. The tiled hotel had 50 workers cleaning the floor (making it hard to walk), but why couldn't someone fix the sewage smells? 2) Sure it was nice that the housekeeping staff folded our towels into animals, but did I want them to GO THROUGH MY BAGS AND STEAL A CAMERA. My brand new, digital Nikon was taken out of my room. I approached the houskeeping staff and the management, and it seemed as if not a soul cared whether or not I had my memory card with 100's of photos. WATCH YOUR STUFF... ALL OF THE SAFE KEYS ARE THE SAME FOR ALL VACATIONERS. If the safe isn't saf, what is? 3) Lastly, if you are looking for a 'fun' and 'wild' hotel don't stay here. Cancun or Acapulco are much more entertaining. But that ISN'T what I was looking for. The hotel claimed it was 'spring breaker' free, and all I wanted was some quite beach and pool time with my daughter. Than why were the annoying pool staff bugging us (and the rest of the elderly/middle aged people staying there) to join water arobics and riffle shooting? Why did an old lady get hit in the head with a volleyball while a techno song repeated (daily) in the background about 'booty calls'. Not too classy. More like a trashy Las Vegas hotel. 4)Lastly I would like to say that I couldn't sleep for two reasons. A) The beds were hard but not horrid. B) The AWFUL music and night time entertainment drove me to insanity at night, I would have paid money to shut the off key songers up. 5) Don't order mixed drinks, they taste like perfume.", "Date": "February 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Upsate NY", "Title": "\u201cOUTSTANDING\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3184991", "Content": "My family and I were there in September (wife and 2 yr. old twins) and it was excellent.

The only thing that I can honestly say that I wasn't completely happy with was the hard beds. They were a little too firm for me.

You can only make them the same day you are going, and I believe booking starts at 7 am. Activites are great as well. You can do as little or as much as you want to. There's a team of activity co-ordinators that orchestrate anything from beach volleyball, water aerobics, fashion shows etc. Or...you can just plunk yourself down on the beach. But...get a chair early, as like any place there's a lot of early morning chair reserving going on. If you get there around 6:30, you'll see a beautiful sunrise in the morning. By the way, yes they could use a bar at the beach, but there's 3 in total, and none are that far.

Beginning with our flight from Philadelphia, to the customs in Cancun, to the front door and check in at the hotel, everything was perfect. We requested an upper floor down by the pool and we were happy with our third floor garden view...in the pretty pink building...close to the pool, bar and Turquesa restaruant. The room had a slight musty smell upon arrival, but after opening the door and airing it out, it was fine. The room was big enough for us and the bathroom was huge. The mini bar had more than we would ever use and they kept refilling it as requested.. especially the diet soda! The room was kept immaculate all week. As far as the food, we enjoyed the buffet, tried the Steak House once and the Mediterranean twice. The ala carte retaurants were just about average but service and ambiance were nice. We did try breakfast at the Riu Tequilla and Tucan and that was fun. At all the restaurants, the waiters, waitresses and bar tenders were very gracious. The beach is just magnificent and there were plenty of loungers both in the shade of the palm trees and out in the open...your choice.

After reading the reviews before we left, we were a little nervous. The hotel is on the smaller size which makes it very manageable for walking to meals, pool, beach, etc. We had two adjacent rooms and they were spotless, large, and well appointed. We found the beds firm but very comfortable - far superior to the ones you sometimes get where you roll into the worn out middle! One room did have a slight stale odor - again, hard to dintinquish the source. We did bring room spray and left the door open when we were there and it was fine. The other room never had the odor - so just ask to be moved if you find it objectionable. We were on the third floor which was extremely quiet and offered cathedral ceilings which made it feel very large. The beach and water were spectacular - swimming was great. The surf however prevented the staff from allowing water sports the entire week. The width of the beach is also rather lacking (seemingly at all the Playa resorts) so the chairs are rather packed-in but palm trees are interspersed which offer the chance to be out of the sun if desired. The pool was rather cool but many people seemed to hang out there, especially with younger children. There are topless women, many Europeans seem to frequent the area - so if that bothers you, be forwarned. The food setup could seem somewhat cattle-callish, however we found sitting on the outside terrace contributed greatly to our enjoyment of meals as it was much smaller and quieter than the general dining room. There is plenty to choose from, the breakfasts were the best. Dinners got somewhat monotonous but there was always a salad bar (I would bring my own dressing next time,) fresh fruit, soups and fantastic salsa and chips. The only thing we were extremely careful about was the seafood and some meats. It makes sense to use judgement on what to select and you will have no stomach problems. If you are particular about your choice of alcohol or wine I would recommend bringing some. Their high end vodka was Smirnoff and they don't offer the opportunity to order good bottles of wine. We missed that but the Cuervo Gold margaritas were good - you need to ask for the name brands. The entertainment is fun and totally optional. We went a few nights and had a good time. The New Year's Eve party was a blast. (two, live Mexican bands) The staff is extremely friendly and eager to please. The facility and rooms are spotless. If you are not happy and you don't speak up it's your own fault. Trips: we went on a Tulum/Xel Ha trip. Both are amazing destinations but were extremely crowded. We wished we were warned about the crowds. ALso don't take a tour there that involves a coach bus, ours stopped at five more hotels to pick up people resulting in a long, long bus ride instead of what should have been a quick one. A small van or cab would have been much better. Swimming with the dolphins was a great experience for our kids and the half-day snorkel trip is also highly recommended. Downtown: The Riu location is excellent in that you can visit the \"Mexican street\" across the street for a little shopping, or walk down to Playa del Carmen (20 minute walk) along clean, safe sidewalks to a really authentic Mexican town with tons of shops, restaurants, bars and the ferry to Cozumel. There was also a golf course that looked very nice which we did not have a chance to go to. We would go back again. The weather was spectacular every day, the people very accomodating and the beauty of the surroundings is really special. PS- Going AI with teens is highly recommended. They could come and go as they pleased, sleep late and eat breakfast late, etc. This made it a low stress time for all of us and as a result we really enjoyed each other's company all the more.

While we encountered a problem with the hotel's smell, the same can not be said of the location, the staff or the service; they were excellent. The staff, whether working in the restaurants or attending the rooms, always worked industriously, professionally and enthusiastically. The facility itself, however, falls short. It has a major shortcoming: its rooms have a musty, moldy, sewer-like smell. I think the problem lies within the architectural design of the building. Either the plumbing lines, sewage lines or atmospheric moisture is seeping into the concrete block construction of the hotel walls causing moldy, foul and stale breathing conditions. We noticed a similar smell at the Riu Yucatan as well when walking through it, despite the fact that the workers scrub clean the hotel floors, walls and bathrooms, spotlessly. Thankfully, our stay was short, because we could not stomach a longer stay. We needed to have the doors open and the fan on to endure the week. Flowers and scent devices were put into the room to try and mask the underlying problem. This moldy musty smell problem was identified on an internet forum a year ago, and we had hoped the problem had been corrected, but it has not. As well, almost half of the fourteen people in our party encountered stomach and intestinal bacterial infections by the last half of the week causing us to miss at least 1 or 2 days of our six actual days at the hotel. At a cost of nearly $3000 from Calgary, this makes each day lost very expensive. Unless something is done to correct the hotel's smell, and money put in to improve the refrigeration and distribution of its food, we will never return to the Rius. All that being said, the beach is gorgeous, the staff are friendly and professional.

In the evening, enjoy a lovely dinner (buffet or al a carte) at Playacar and then plan the rest of the night out. Both Yucatan and Tequila have discos, pretty good evening shows and a lively party atmosphere. When you're through with the dancing, the partying and the drinking - return to the civility of Playacar. It is a couple's paradise - leave the kids at home, and don't book into this resort if you're a major partier - it's not meant to be that kind of place.", "Date": "December 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "nj", "Title": "\u201cnever again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2906996", "Content": "Hotel is not clean, the food was not always fresh and the same menu every day.

I have been to all inclusives in Bahamas, Antigua, Dominican, and now Mexico, and this is up there with my faves of all time. I did read a million reviews on the resort before I went, and I know if you are reading reviews on this site then you are probably looking to make a decision on a hotel in this area...Please dont be mislead by the negative reviews... This hotel is great: Great atmosphere, Great location, Beautiful beach, Friendly people, VERY hard workers, Clean rooms / nice mexican feel in lobby and restaurants, Stunning Pool and lovely grounds, nice size as it is small enough to get around with ease, nightly entertainment is quite good, check in / check out was simple as can be, Safe beach / safe area (it is a gated area so all the hotels are within a gated community making you feel very safe to walk at all hours of the day/night, Within walking distance to all Rius and you can use their facilities. The rest of my review will clear up a few things that I have read in others, and also add information that I felt would have been useful when reading other reviews: 1. Some reviews say there are no alarm clocks in the rooms. There are alarm clocks in the rooms and they work great, as does the wake up calls! 2. Awesome place to do dophins : Discovery Dophins...Clean, long session with dophins, professional, fresh ocean location, not a small tank. 3. Cozumel: awesome place to do snorkelling...can take the ferry over for 18 dollars return and sign up once you arrive as there are many people selling guided snorkelling tours on the pier. 4. Tipping: many people didnt tip, but we did and they really appreciate it as you will see soon, they work extremely long hours... some times from 6:30 AM till 11:00 pm. Please tip them well as they are such great people. 5. Bring own cups: YES !!! their cups are very very very small... like i am talking kid size and plastic... bring your own bigger plastic cups and they will make your drinks in it no problem. 6. In comparison to other rius: this one is smaller, but I liked it better : Riu Tequila looked nice but is not on the beach, Riu Palace was stunning but very ritzy, Riu Yucatan was lush and pretty but felt very dark because of all the trees (even around the pool it always felt shaded), All are great to visit, but i LOVED the lay out and size and atmosphere of the Playacar... I am soooo happy I picked this one after visiting the others and spending time at ours as well as theirs.... 7. Internet cafe...cheaper accross the street instead of in the hotel itself.... All the rius have onsite internet however. 8. Food: Dont miss mexican night at the buffet... it is GREAT ! Buffet has food for everyone : breakfast has eggs cooked to your liking, fresh squeezed juice, fruit, cheeses, sausages... bacon... you name it... dinners have it all... seafood options, meats, veggies, pastas, cold salads... I did not find that i got sick of the food at all... it was all good....Tried the steak house and it was delicious... if you like well done steak, order medium as it will still come well done ! they like to cook their meat well i think!!! so knock it down a notch when you are ordering and it will come how you want it.... this dinner was like a 5 course meal starting with soup, then salad, then the meal, followed by baked alaska (flaming)... it was Delicious!!! 9. Playa Del carmen as a town : very beautiful... almost feels like a mini spain... great bars if you want to go there at night... 10. Age group at the hotel : all kinds... the week we went there were only a few kids... majority middle age, and I am in my mid 20's and I met several people my age to hang out with... I had a great time so dont worry, there are people for everyone of all ages there!!! 11. Time Share people: didnt come accross any and i was prepared to find hundreds based on the reviews! just be aware, but dont be over paranoid as I didnt find a single time share person. 12. Cancun airport: No problems here... it was smooth as can be for us.... 13. washrooms off site ... if you are doing day trips off the resort, be prepared, some of the washrooms you will encounter might be interesting...and many of them cost money if you are out side of the resort... like in cozumel... not alot... just a few cents. 14. Rooms and beds: yes, beds are hard but I slept great, ask for a room facing the walkway... building 3 and 4 are smack dab in the middle of the pools and the lobby/ restaurant so i would request these builidings if I were you as i heard that the buildings too close to the lobby were loud at night with lobby bar noise and that the buildings near the night entertainment could also get loud.... we slept great... no noise travelled through our walls... it was a wonderful, nice decor, clean room... towel art every day, restocked fridge, alcohol dispensers in the room... in room safe, TV with a few english channels, bottled water provided in room fridge and also at front desk, shampoo and soap and shower gel in small packets (we brought our own as we prefer to use a normal size bar of soap... your choice!) 15. Alcohol : if you want name brand alcohol, just ask for it... they have it, but you have to ask. 16. the smell that many talk about : does not exist at this resort from what i could tell, but you can definitly get a whiff of it as you walk up the main street past other hotels... it must be something in their sewers or something... but you dont have it at the playacar... see, it is paradise here!!! 17. When you get off the plane to go on your trip, dont lose the declaration form that you filled out... YOU NEED THIS TO GET BACK ON THE PLANE to come home ! 18. they are quite good at speaking many languages... we had no problems here communicating in english. 19. Dont pay more than 40 paseos to down town playa del carmen... this is the going rate... 20. Towel service was GREAT...big towels, trade them in if they get wet... no probs... No probs with getting a chair around the pool or on the beach...also lots of sunny as well as shaded areas at both 21. Facilities accross the street : complexes right across the street that you can get things you need... pharmacy stuff, cameras, internet, souviners, etc...though i am sure this stuff is cheaper down town, but if you dont want the fuss of down town, it is literally steps away. Areas of improvement that I saw : Only two things here... firstly, it would be great to have a beach bar... secondly, bigger cups at the bar... plastic is fine, but needs to be increased in size big time as they truely are kids size!!! Thats all for now... i took 3 disposable cameras and filled them all... it was just such a great trip... and I highly recommend this resort... If you like to have fun and enjoy a resort that is friendly with hard workers taking care of you, this is the place for you!

We are very experienced travellers having been to the US VI, Jamaica, Costa Rica, the Dom. Rep. and Mexico, as well as to Europe many times. The rooms at the Riu Playacar are immaculately kept and we found the buffet food far better than other chains we've stayed at, including the Barcelos & Iberostars. One downside to the food is the ala cartes. They are not worth going to in my opinion. We found the drinks very good and they do have top shelf liquors - you just have to ask for them, perhaps it's because they know us very well, but we were never given a \"watered down\" drink. The beach is beautiful here and unlike another reviewer, I think it's much nicer than Canun's beach since in Cancun I don't remember one palm tree on the beach. Here there are many palms and the water is much calmer than in Cancun. All the staff was very kind & helpful to us on our many visits and we look forward to going back to the Riu Playacar again.

I would not return to the area, nor the hotel complex. This area of Mexico is overbuilt and heavily populated with tourists. If one is looking for a Cancun, Miami Beach, Myrtle Beach type of vacation this would be the spot for you. If one is looking for something quieter and more relazing, as well as less cement/structures and more nature(what God created, not man) I would recomend one go elsewhere. I myself prefer the outer banks of North Carolina to the hustle, bustle, people and cement of a city located on the beach. The hotel had beautifully landscaped grounds. Due to heavy usage the hotel itself appears to be much older than it actually is. This hotel is located on the beach, but two other Riu's are not and as a result the hotel actually buses in hundreds and hundreds of guests from their non beach locations every half hour on the hour. One begins to feel as though they are beaching in a bus/train station. The pool is cleaned daily but one really can't tell. The heavy guest usage shows greatly in the condition of the pool. There was actually trash on the bottom of the pool that remained on the bottom of the pool all week long.Our room smelled very badly/musty. Though our clothes/luggage/ect. have been left in the garage to air out for the past three days they still smell sour. A lot of food is provided, but as is typical of a buffet the quality suffers when huge quantities are being prepared. The restaurant wait staff were under staffed and as a result you end up waiting on yourself a great deal of the time. The housekeeping staff was the highlight of the week. The towel animals and flowers were a very nice touch. The rooms were always cleaned very well. The noise level in the hotel was irritating. The evening show traveled through the complex making it difficult to sleep at night-11pm. The level of noice at the pool became a major irritant. The staff loved their microphones,speakers and whistles a bit to much. Though guest involvement was minimal at best with the pool/pool deck activities the noise/music/whistles blasted throughout the day making relazing, reading, napping, ect difficult. One began to feel as though they were in a club 24-7. I would strongly recomend Cozumel over this area any day as well as the Allegro complex located on Cozumel.

Covered and hidden in the suitecase so incase someone looked in, couldn't see it as a precaution would felt we shouldn\u2019t have to take. We spoke with the manager, (I believe it was Gabriel) and he said that he would have the security look into it. About and hour later, we spoke to a girl at the front desk and she told us that there were more than a few people that complained about things being stolen. Which to me and many others, should not be happening in a 5 star resort! We realized they were missing the day we were leaving, needless to say this ruined our perfect honeymoon The value of the chain and ring are approximately $700-$1000, which doesn't include the personal value of the jewelry. As well my wife had an encounter with one of the head staff from the main restaurant. He seemed to have too much to drink that night after work and asked my new wife to take him up to her room. She laughed it off, however, I didn't. In a 5 star resort I expect professionalism from ALL the staff especially on the premises. Other that these incidents, we had a great honeymoon.

Weather was steamy but expected, Arrived at 12:00 noon to the hotel, were greated with drinks at the lobby (non alcoholic) went to the rooms which were COLD , nothing wrong with the air, had to use the spare blanket at night. Room temperture must have been around 60 degrees. Plus the ceiling fan once adjusted kept the air circulating. I did bring small scented candles and used them for about 3 days, the room was musty but I can see why at this time of year, and the candles did the trick, I had read a review before I left about the clock situation and bought a small travel clock , it wasn't nessasary the rooms now all have clocks. Big Ones! Food was OK and as someone else said it's not a cruise ship, more like a Country Buffet or one of those big Buffet resturaunts in the States. The Buffet is actually better then the resturaunts. They had the same menu everynight and after trying the steak house once we never went back. There is no Bar service in either the resturaunts if you want a cocktail you have to get it from the outside bar and bring it with you, I did see someone tip a waiter 1 night and Tequilia shots were brought in for them. There is almost no service of any kind in the buffet dinning room. There are some waiters with Water and Coffee but they never came to our table and we always had to get up and get our own. We were gently reminded to leave at 8:30PM from the 7:00 PM seatings which we never got to till 7:45 so felt a bit rushed sometimes. There is NO room service, and you have to remind them what liquer you would like the bar stocked with. Watered down doesn't begin to describe the liquer... I can handle about 5 Vodka Tonics ( my cut off point) over a 4 or 5 hour period before I feel the effects. I could drink literally 10 in the space of 3 hours and not have any effect. If you go to town you can buy your own but it is way overpriced almost the same as in the states, You are better off buying a bottle from the Duty free shop at the airport or going over to Cozemel. Now to the pools , there are two and a wadding pool , Why is it that parents can be soooo rude as to bring babies in the adult swim up bar pool . There are enough pools in this resort to make a Family pool and adutls only pool , Management if you are listening you need to pay attention to this, this is my biggest complaint. Watching babies throwup or have Bowel movements in a pool is disgusting. They need to be wearing swim diapers and be in a Family pool not the adult swim up bar pool. No child under 12 should be in an adult pool. Now to the activities. I would recomend caution when taking part in the Parasailing / snorkeling that is offered off the resort. My friend was hooked into the harness wrong and was litleraly falling out of it at 100 ft up when they finally noticed the reeled them in but he was slammed into side of the boat, when they pulled him on board they repostioned the harness and sent him back up with out even asking him if he was OK. Now I saw other Parasailing with no incedents but I would have a plan to signal if you want down . The other thing the water was very rough and the driver of the Wave runner who took us out to the boat thought he was funny jumping waves and redlinning the the waveruuner. These aren't designed for 3 people but that is what they put on them and the person in the back was in danger, had they let go there death grip once they would have been tossed into very rough water. We went snorkleing that day too, in to open ocean. Again rough , my mask kept filling up with water and breaking , the guide kept yelling at me to put my face in the water and I had to yell back my mask was broken , He fixed it and I headed back to the boat myself , about 1000 ft This was not a good day to snorkel, I have snorkeled in Cozemel before and I think that's the better place to go. Also the water over the coral was extremmely shallow where we went and you were tossed into it often, many people got scratched up and swollowed alot of salt water. Even getting onto the boat was bad , we had to walk out to it and climb up the ladder, a wave came and slamned me into the ladder and I cut my foot , they gave me a piece of cotton to stop the bleeding. Now I have to in all honesty say we used poor judgement on this trip the water was to rough , we knew and we went anyway. We should have just waited for another day. Overall the stay was enjoyable , But things management need to work on are the pool , it was filthy by the end of the week and I mean at 7:30 in the morning when know one was in it. They should have bar service in the dinning rooms, and fans in the outdoor theater near the bar area. Change the Dinning room menus or at least have a choice each night of 3 or 4 things. On the rooms the only thing I can say is more dresser space is needed. thier was not enough draws for 2 people. Positive notes. The rooms were nice, clean and roomy, Yes the bed was hard but I don't have a problem with that. The staff is extremely hard working, These people put in 15 hours days and yet somehow remain gracious and curteous every minute of the day. I applaud them, I felt the few extra dollars ( maybe $25.00 total) I handed out in tips during the week was well earned by them. I truely apprecialted thier fine service. I liked the set up for the resort area itself, shopping across the street , 5 min cab ride into town.. safe envioriment, but I would not go back to this Hotel, I would however go to the one next door , for a little more money I would try the Royal Hideaway.

I was a bit worried that it would be a bit too snobby since it's a 5star but was happy to see that it was more laid back. The animation team is fantastic. Those guys never stop entertaining, especially Joseph. We laughed all the time. The check-in was so fast and easy. Later on that same night, they called our room to check if we were satisfied with it. A couple days later we got a welcome letter on our bed from the manager. They really try their best to make sure the customers are happy with the resort. The room was great. My husband loved the mini-bar filled with beer, water, soda water and pop. The alcohol dispenser was a perfect touch. The towel arragements were amazing. We got turtles, crocodiles, dogs, elephants, flower baskets, etc... I didn't know you could make so much with a towel. The layout and size of the resort is great. Not too big and not complicated. The buffet was very good. A good variety. Deserts are very good especially the flambe bananas. I had no complaints expect for the eggs in the morning. They seemed a bit watery compared to ours back home. This was the first vacation that we did not get sick due to the food. I liked the idea of dress code requirements but have to admit that at 115 degrees, the men didn't really feel like wearing long pants. My husband wore golf shorts some evenings and the staff did not say anything. The bars offer a good selection of different drinks. The alcohol amount in the drinks are just about right but towards the middle of the vacation, the bar staff kept pouring more and more each time. I have to admit that it doesn't hit you like it does back home. We never got drunk even though the amount we drank some nights. We had a blast with the bar staff. They are so friendly. The pools were great especially since the sea was rough the second week due to Hurricane Ivan. The beach was amazing. Alot of chairs are available and the palm trees provide the shade needed. The only problem with not having the pallapas is that you have to move your chair around during the course of the day if you want shade. All in all, it was the best resort we have been to and are definetly recommending it to anybody who want to have fun and relax as well.", "Date": "September 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denton, Texas", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Time!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2594053", "Content": "My fiance and I returned yesterday from 4 nights, 5 days (Sept. 18-22, 2004) at the Riu Playacar.

Many people always hold back on eating certain foods in Mexico. My boyfriend and I did not hold back at all at this resort. We ate everything!!! The food was absolutely fantastic. And guess what? We did not get sick at all! The staff was even better. We particularly had a really fun time with the bartenders that work down by the theatre. They made the trip just that much better. I read in several other reviews that people had an issue with the rooms being \"musty\". Frankly...I really have no idea what they are talking about. I always keep the air condition very low in any hotel room. Doing so during my stay left me with no \"musty\" feeling of the room. I would say that the only down fall is that there are no ocean view rooms. The resort is more like a small community. If you are looking to actually wake up and look out your window at a full ocean view..then this would not be the place for you. But everything else about the resort made up for that. The beach is enormous! I have never been on a larger beach at a mexican resort than this one. The entertainment crew was always a ton of fun as well. There are people of all different ages at this resort, which made it interesting. I would recommend this resort to any person of any age!!!!

However hopefully our comments are still helpful. We previously stayed at the Riu Merengue in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic in 2001 and returned to the Riu chain b/c of our great experience. The Riu Playacar was a nice hotel but not outstanding. The best part about the hotel is its beach. The sand is pure white and clean, with many shade trees. The ocean is gorgeous. We saw many people doing parasailing and other watersports. The pool is also very nice. One part was more rowdy and had a lot of kids. The other was more quiet and filled with adults. The pool bar was great. We thought that the maid service/minibar was very good. We left a few dollars tip each day and a note the first day in Spanish to please leave an extra gallon of water and extra cokes and beer. After that we got just what we requested. The maid also left beautiful flowers and towel art several days. Aside from the maid, however, we were not thrilled with the staff at Riu Playacar. Whereas at Riu Merengue the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful (to the extent that we missed them when we returned home), at Riu Playacar they were somewhat indifferent and unfriendly. This was a big disappointment. Some might attribute this to a language issue, but I speak fluent Spanish so it was not that. The room is a typical Riu room with two double beds pushed together instead of a king. It's not ideal if you like a king, but it's not as much of a problem as some make it out to be. The room had a lovely balcony and the room has pleasing hardwoods throughtout. The walls were paper thin however. You could hear everything in the other rooms and in the hallways. This woke us up every day. The shower was difficult to work w/o getting water everywhere. The resort does not have the most attractive layout as it is basically long and thin. This means that almost no one has an ocean view and you don't get that casual, sprawled out feel that some other resorts have. On the other hand, it didn't take long to get from one place to another. We are familiar with the Riu style buffet and a la carte restaurant seating/reservation arrangement. Frankly we thought the food was not very good at all. It frequently was not chilled/warmed properly and there was a surprising lack of variety from day to day. After not having become ill at all in the DR, we both became quite ill for about 3 days at the Playacar. I suppose it could have been from a dinner in Playa del Carmen but I suspect not b/c of the lack of refrigeration/heating I mentioned. Luckily there is a convenient shopping plaza right across the street and they have a drugstore where you can buy any medicine you need. There were also swimwear shops there with a nice variety. The hotel's location is very good--just a few minutes cab ride from Playa del Carmen. Playa del Carmen is pleasant. There are lots of nice restaurants, shops and bars to choose from, albeit at high prices--practically American prices. Plus the vendors are clearly all collaborating in their prices. Even bargaining with them did not get great results. All in all we enjoyed our 5 days at Riu Playacar. But I wouldn't return there (although I'd return to Playa del Carmen) and there are other hotels that are probably superior (Iberostars, Palace).", "Date": "August 27, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Family Holiday\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2493211", "Content": "We just returned from the RIU Playacar on August 23rd, 2004.

We have been traveling to Mexico for years and tried many of the all inclusives. Of the three we have tried in the Playa Del Carmen area, the Riu has the best food. The only reason I do not give this resort an \"excellent\" is that you had to sign up for a set dinner time for the entire stay. All other all inclusives we have stayed at only require reservations for the specialty restaurants. The Riu demands reservations even for the evening buffet. One reason we chose an all inclusive is that there is no need for a watch. We can do whatever we want, whenever we want. Having to eat at a certain time puts a damper on that. Also, we had requested the 9:00 seating thinking that we may not always be ready to leave the beach and get ready for dinner by 7:00. Unfortunately, a few of the nights we were starving by 7:30 but just had to wait it out. There is no where to get a snack after 5:00 p.m. to hold you over for dinner. The Gala and the Iberostar have food service around the clock (There was always a snack available or room service, which was not offered at the Riu). The Riu is absolutely beautiful. The grounds are prettier than the Gala or Iberostar and far prettier than anyplace we have stayed in Cancun. Is is small enough that there is never a wait at the bar or at the buffets. The place is immaculate. Housekeeping starts working very early in the morning and doesn't stop until mid-evening. All were very friendly and accommodating. Another perk was that they only charged $1.00 to connect you to an ATT operator to use a calling card. Any other place we have stayed charges at least $10-$15/call. There are so many chairs around the pool and beach that we didn't have to play the towel game as we did at all other resorts (getting up at 6:30-7:00 to put your towels on your chairs). We moved freely from the beach to the pool and never had problems getting chairs. Regarding the air conditioning complaints I have read, these people were clearly not in our building. We were in building 5, 2nd floor. It was freezing at night. Not only did we have to turn the fan off before going to sleep, but sometime in the middle of the night, had to turn the AC completely off because it was so cold. The musty smell is all over Mexico - if you want dry, go to Arizona. We brought plug ins, no big deal. I was not as impressed with the Animacion team as some others on this board. I thought they were a bit lazy and one young man was very perverted. I am no prude by any means and was traveling with an 18 and 21 year old so it didn't offend me. However, if I had small children and they witnessed his pole dancing at the pool and his gyrations in his speedo, I would not have been very happy as this is a family resort, not adults only. The entertainment staffs at the other resorts were more outgoing. The staff didn't walk the beach and pool to get people involved as I have seen everywhere else. You pretty much just had to look for things going on (volleyball on the beach and in the pool, shooting range, bingo, etc) as they didn't come looking for participants. I thought they could have been a bit more interactive or at least posted a sign somewhere daily that listed what was happening. If you weren't at the right place when something was starting, you were just out of luck. In fact, we didn't find out that they played bingo every day until we were checking out and someone was talking about it because we must have been on the beach when it was announced at the pool.

The water was fabulous, the beach was the best I've seen and the staff was great. I wish I could have stayed longer! Everything was great so I will try and give you as many tips as possible. Snorkeling at the actual reef is not free, it's $50 for 2 people, but you can use the scuba equipment on the beach for free. Of course, there is not much to see at the beach and the water is more murky. Parasailing is a must though, and it will cost you about $70 per couple. If you want to use a Kayak or boogie board, it's free. If you want to do any water sports however, you must sign a release at the Scuba Shop (so they are not responsible if you get hurt) and they will punch a hole in your wrist band indicating you've signed the release. There will be a little hut set up on the beach called Scuba Caribe where you can check out all of the water toys. As many others have noted, the air conditioning is mediocre, but as long as you keep the balcony door closed and your ceiling fan is on high (blowing down), it is comfortable at night. I agree, the beds are hard, but it was no problem for us. I also agree the rooms are quite musty, but we were used to it after a day or so. I didn't even notice it by the end of the week. I think the Cancun Airport had the same exact smell. The resort is 100 yards from the Carribbean so this is understandable. You may want to bring an air freshener if you think it will bother you. The cups at the bar during the day are small and you may want to bring a larger insulated cup, but for us they were fine. The mini refrigerator is restocked every 2 days with Pepsi, Corona, Bottle Water, Orange Soda, and 7up. We thought it was very convenient that they give you towel cards at check in. There is a booth by the pool area with clean beach towels where you can give your card to them and they give you a beach towel so there is no need to bring beach towels. It would be a waste of space in your suitcase. If you lose a towel card, it does cost $20, so be careful. If you want to take any trips, there are desks set up in the main lobby represented by Funjet, Apple, or GoGo Travel, and they can arrange it for you. We went to Xel-Ha, and it was a great time. You can snorkel, explore jungle, swim with dolphins and much more. The Mayan ruins are also very nice. Tulum, Coba, Chichen Izta are all well worth the price. If you're staying at the Riu Playacar, you can also visit the other Riu resorts nearby. The Riu Palace is just 2 resorts down the street and the Riu Yucutan is next to the Palace. The Riu Yucutan has much more jungle canopy on it's property and is a larger resort that includes a Disco Club, and a weight room. The Riu Tequila is across the street from the Yucutan and is nice too, but has no beach so it's a little less expensive. You may want to check out the other resorts one afternoon. Also, there is a nice outdoor stip mall across the street from the Riu Playacar with plenty of gift shops, and even a convenience store with Pepto, film, water cameras, etc. All in all, I would highly recommend this resort, and we are already thinking of going back next year. In my opinion this is a great deal for the price.

We actually spent two weeks at this wonderful resort the first week was our wedding and the second was our honeymoon. We travelled down with a group of sixteen people, what a great experience. When we decided to get married at this resort we found limited resources of information about getting married in Mexico. So this is truely for the new brides and grooms who are looking for wedding reviews. Before we arrived at our hotel, we had been corresponding with the wedding coordinator well over 6 mths (must let you know they seem to have a problem retaining their staff) we dealt with two. Anyhow we made sure that we followed up every week closer to the wedding date via email to ensure no problems would occur. We had requested specific building closer to the beach (building 5 & 6) and a suite if possible, since we were getting married and having our honeymoon there (building 5 & 6). All building have 3 floors, the first day they gave us a 3rd floor room in building 2 which didn't have a shower curtain, a flushing problem and the A/C didn't work. This is where we experienced our first problem, after calling front desk we were told that someone would attend the problem. We arrived at 2pm that day we had someone come by and put a shower curtain up but not until 11pm the washroom problem was not fixed. We also requested a suite ( they only have 4 I believe) which were all occupied. I found that the night managers who were inexperienced, it was better dealing with the day managers who were able to deal with the problems a lot quicker. We met with the wedding coordinator on Tuesday, our wedding was on Thursday that week. Here are some tips and things that we suggest you do if you decided to get married in Mexico. Select a date and time, you can select the place when you arrive. make sure that you have all documentation for yourself and your two witnesses. Ask when you will receive your wedding certificate (make arrangements) If you are getting your hair done at the salon, make your reservation with the stylist before your arrival via the wedding coordinator this rule also applies to your guests. Bring pictures (saves alot of time due to the language barrier) Make arrangements with the wedding coordinator about which restaurant and menu (you can get this from the wedding coordinator) you would like via email. Before you arrive you can select a package, once that has been done you will be requested to send back an agreement with your signature. You pay once you meet with the coordinator. When you meet the coordinator she will show you an album where you make select your location (which they decorate), flowers and cake. We chose on the beach under the palms (very beautiful) which provided some shade for our guests. Be ready for the crowd that seems to assemble during the ceremony (which is usually 20 min) who are all in their beach attire. Our photographer was part of the package (Julio, wonderful guy!!!) We were able to negotiate the negatives for a fabulous price!!!! Our wedding ceremony and pictures were at the Riu Palace, our Mariachi band, dinner and dance was at the Riu Playacar. So yes we all walked 5 min over to the Palace. (Bring your own cold water, unless you are staying at the Palace they don't usually give the guests any drinks, which was really silly considering how hot it was!) We arrived back to the resort (Playacar) after pictures to enjoy a Mariachi band (for an hour) and toasting with champagne). We enjoyed a outdoor sit down dinner with our guests (we had one and half hour to eat dinner) We cut our cake, took more pics and then proceeding to the pool to have our first dance ( they had lit it up) we brought a CD and player to play our first dance. I have to say the food was great, always a good variety. They had great mixed drinks, watch out for the drinks mixed with coconut (natural laxative). Tip: Bring an insulated mug They have a great entertainment staff, especially Sergio who kept everyone happy. Show every night at 10pm. You could also go over to Riu Tequila to the disco (which has A/C) Yeah!!! We found emailing our friends in T.O through MSN than phone calls (Watch out for this can get very expensive) If you call the neighboring hotel (Riu Palace) as we did you are still charged for this we were not aware of this. The internet cafe across the street was much cheaper, even cheaper in Playa Del Carmen. We went several times into Playa Del Carmen $4 US cab ride. Walked the route of cafes, restaurants, bars and souvenier vendors. We took the ferry over to Cozumel (watch out for those of you who get sea sick) Take a gravol before you go also anything with ginger does the trick. The ride is usually 30 min Cozumel is great for snorkeling and duty free shopping especially for jewellery. We found that snorkeling at the resort was not great, didn't see any fish. Cozumel was great for this, worth the nausea.

The air conditioning was mediocre, probably fine for most, but we like a cold bedroom for sleeping. The mattresses are very hard, as seems to be the case all over Mexico. The pillows were hard and uncomfortable. Small things really, we had a great time. One other thing, the shower area is separated from the bedroom by only a curtain, open in the middle. It didn't matter to us, but to some it might present some uncomfortable moments. There were plenty of lounge chairs at all times, wherever we wished to sit we could find available chairs. The rear third of the beach is covered with palm trees, nice to enjoy the beach and still be in the shade. Be careful not to sit under one with coconuts, they hurt. And yes, topless sunbathing is common. We took the ATV tour through the jungle to a waterhole. It was fun, and worth the money. We also took a dinner cruise on the \"Columbus\". Avoid this.

If the bathroom curtain is closed, the cold air will not reach the bedroom. Simple, leave the door closed, and open the curtains when you go to bed, set the dial to 17 degrees and you will be fine.

All in all this was our second trip to the RIU resorts in this area and we were extremely happy with the service and the hotel premises. To all the people that complain, stay home........or learn to appreciate what you have rather the concentrate on finding faults. These people work for minimum wage $120 a month, and always smile, and we appreciated their efforts with daily tips.

We used Apple Vacations / Allegient Air from Denver. This was our 2nd trip to Mexico; first was three years ago and we stayed at the Moon Palace. We chose the Riu Playacar based on reviews on the internet and comments from a neighbor who visited last year. The beach area is beautiful. Very soft sand, no seaweed (didn't return to Moon Palace due to excessive seaweed), crystal clear water, and ample loungers. The best thing we brought on our trip was $1.50 blow up float mats which we used to float around on the ocean for hours and hours. It was so hot during our visit it was impossible to just lay out on a chair, but the float mats were great. The scuba shop will fill the mats if you don't want to blow up yourself. We also brought mugs (great tip we received on this site!). The cups you get from the pool bar and other areas are the smallest I've ever seen. In that kind of heat you'll finish your drink before you ever get back to your chair. We always tipped the bartenders a dollar or two when asking them to fill up our mugs. All of the staff was extremely polite, friendly and helpful. Never ran into any staff that were unaccomodating. Our room didn't get made up until 4PM the first day, but was done by late morning later in the trip. The rooms were very clean, as was the entire resort. We had 3rd floor, building 3, but overlooked the back of the resort next door -- poor view. The air conditioning was basically non-existant, but we were only in the room to sleep, and with the ceiling fan running we were comfortable to sleep. (very hot though if we came back from an activity). I usually love the heat and thought it was strange there were no blankets on the beds. Definately didn't need them! We left all of our remaining pesos and around $5 US for the room steward when we left. (along with our mats we didn't want to deflate and haul home!) The food was OK and presented quite nicely. I just didn't like the idea of set dining times. Since we were only there for 4 days, I survived the buffet, but I think an entire week of buffet food (breakfast, lunch, dinner) would get a bit old after a while. There was a large variety, and we always found something we liked -- never went hungry! Having the shopping center across the street was very nice. We used the internet cafe at Donnelly's several times to check in at home. Only $1 for 10 minutes. We also walked into Playa one afternoon to shop and took a cab back. The Playacar area has some beautiful homes and the walk was about 25 minutes. We also took a cab to town for dinner one evening and ate at La Parilla. The food was very good. We took a snorkeling trip through the Scuba Caribe center on site. We paid the day prior for the 12:30 trip. They told us to show up at the same place the next day at noon to get our gear, which we did. The attendant then told us to wait by the picnic tables, which we did. It began to thunder and sprinkle and no one ever approached us about the trip. So at 12:30 I went to the counter to inquire if the trip was still on. I was told it was too late for the 12:30 trip, that we were supposed to take our gear and walk down to the Riu Palace to get the boat for the trip. No one ever told us that, so we wasted the entire morning, but were able to take their 2:30 trip. Make sure you verify where to go if you book through Scuba Caribe. I am used to snorkeling in the Caribbean islands (Curacao, St. John, Aruba), and seeing \"live\" coral reefs. While the area of Cozumel/Playa promotes having the 2nd largest reef in the world, I was very disappointed. No color to it at all -- appeared to be dying. The guides gave no instruction to those that never snorkelled previously. It is very shallow over the reef in the area we stopped and people were getting stuck in the reef, stepping on it to get out, etc. It is such a shame that no care or protection is taken. We saw some pretty fish, but the reef itself was a huge disappointment. We used the peddle boats at the resort and had a good time; also attended the Michael Jackson show which was quite entertaining. Not sure where I caught the \"bug\". I didn't drink the water and was careful about what I ate. Maybe I got something at the restaurant in town or the plane food on the way back. In any case, I've now been quite ill for almost 1 week and am being tested for girardia or samonella. Very limited number of english speaking guests during our first two days; appeared to be more later in our visit. Not a big deal to us, but may be to some that want to meet up with other's they can converse with. Overall, the resort was beautiful, the beach outstanding.

I absolutely LOVED the Riu Playacar. The beach was amazing--shocking turquoise water, white sand that doesn't get hot on your feet, and a nice combination of several days of big waves followed by a few days of very calm surf. The resort grounds were immaculate, almost constantly being cleaned and maintained. There were plenty of comfortable lounge chairs on the beach and at the pool at all times, and we were told the resort was at 98% capacity. The pools were very nice, great swim up-bar, great hobie cat sailboats at the beach, etc. The frozen drinks were delicious and the swim up bar had a great drink menu. Didn't feel the need to bring a huge insulated mug-in fact I thought people looked pretty goofy with them. It was good to get up and get a drink every so often. One day they served huge drinks in coconuts on the beach-I don't know if it was only because it was Easter Sunday but the resort went above and beyond our expectations. Our room was very nice-extremely clean and although the room wasn't freezing cold from AC, we were in Mexico--I didn't want to be bundling up under blankets after a cold Wisconsin winter anyway! I can't believe how many people complain on this site about AC problems on a tropical vacation. There are ceiling fans and it seriously did not impact our sleeping ability at all. Also, we went with another couple and they put us in rooms next to eachother with an outside door to shut to our hallway which was great-it was like having our own suite. The housekeeping staff and the restaurant staff were very nice aand accommodating nd I practiced my Spanish with everyone I could. The towel animals were great and on our last night I half-jokingly asked our housekeeper if he could make me an alligator and the next day there was a huge towel alligator on our bed with sunglasses and a hat on it. It made our day and I made sure to tell him so. We left him a nice tip at the end of our stay. The rest of the staff at the resort were very friendly as well, especially the European students working for the resort entertainment group as a part of their internships in hotel management. The food was really good-always lots of fresh guacamole and the breakfast buffet was great! The only problem with buffets is that it is easy to over eat! The town of Playa del Carmen was a nice 20 min. walk down palm tree lined streets or a quick $5 cab ride. There is a nice pedestrian district with lots of shops and some great restaurants. We had a wonderful dinner at a traditional Mayan restaurant that was recommended by the front desk at the hotel. If you like to snorkel, I would strongly recommend avoiding the funjet/Apple trip to Paradise Reef and going on a trip from Scuba Caribe right at the resort beach instead. The funjet trip was more expensive, and were told it would be a 3 hour trip and instead it was 5 hours, the last hour and a half we were forced to sit at a restaurant and wait for the bus on a beautiful day.

I have been tracking this site trying to get information for about 6 months, and I can safely say that many of the low gradings come from people that NEVER went to the resort (other resorts that try to get the Playacar a bad score) or are UNBELIEVABLY picky. The last couple reviews with the Air Conditioning(could be possible, but did you do ANYTHING else on your trip? If you are only going to stay in your room to test the air conditioning, stay at your local Holiday Inn. If you travel to a beach resort, I strongly suggest visiting the beach and the 1 million + 1 things to do in the Yucatan.) As far as the person not having a room for a few days, I don't believe that story at all. I was in contact with the front desk with different questions everday, and every time they politely answered my question or resolved my problem. The front desk staff was beyond friendly (as was the same for the ENTIRE staff in all areas). I will not say that we didn't have room issues, but they were all fixed quickly. Our drain in the shower was not working well, creating a pool in the shower. We called on it, and within 2 hours it was resolved, no problem. We also called a couple of times about needing more water (you get 3 huge bottled waters, 2 7ups, 2 orange soda, 2 pepsi, and 4 corona bottles in your fridge), and they brought more water shortly. You also get 4 hard liquor bottles in the room (1 each of tequila, rum, vodka, and gin). Complaints about the bed hardness (we got used to it quickly...no big deal at all) and the AC (each room has a big ceiling fan right above the bed) are from probably the same people that complain about getting free gifts. Nothing is ever too good for them. We brought the big insulated mugs, and were pleased how well they worked. we filled them up before we went to the beach and they lasted all afternoon. Otherwise, we probably would have had to go back and get refills 3-4 times...My favorite drink that I concocted was filling my insulated mug with soft-serve vanilla ice cream, getting a small glass of orange pop, bringing it to the bar and having them blend it together with some shots of rum. It was an orange shake that tasted phenomonal on the beach. I also have read about getting up early to get beach chairs. There are ALWAYS chairs available, but if you want a prime spot, get up early, if not, don't worry. The meals...I compare the average meal (buffet style) to a U.S. casino buffet. A lot of different food with some changes everyday. I didn't like the taste of some of the food, but there was always something else that I could choose. We tried the steakhouse one night (you have to make a day-of reservation for that), and it was very good. Other suggestions: -bring lots of $1's, for tipping and making exact payments for things in stores as often they only give back change in pesos. -the cab fair to Playa del Carmen is $4 -Go across the street from the Riu Playacar to book cheaper day-trips...they are on average $20 cheaper. -Choose the 8:30pm dinner time (you could also choose the 6:30pm) as often the vacationers schedule makes it a rush to get ready by 6:30pm. -Guys, bring at least 2-3 pairs of pants. The resort has a rule about wearing pants for dinner and not wearing t-shirts. It is a bit more formal, which is fun, and it was very embarrassing to see many americans still wearing their swimsuit and tank-tops to dinner when it is obvious that everyone else is dressed-up. -The evening shows are all pretty good, and the Michael Jackson show was as good as I have read on this site. We did go one night to the Tequila to their disco, and although the club was smaller than I expected, it was fun for almost all ages (the music was newer dance, r & b, etc... so older couple may not enjoy it as much). -The only time we tipped at the resort was $1 a day for the maid (who was actually a guy). He did a great job cleaning and daily left a towel character that was really cute, and we always found ourselves excited to see what character would be next. We did tip our dinner waiter (you get the same one each night) Joswe (the best waiter of all time) at the end of our trip as well as our vacation host from Olympus Pablo. -If you know any spanish, try to use it. Even if it is only Cervesa (beer). That is their national language and attempts should be used to speak it...although most employees do know a good amount of English...they appreciate your efforts to speak Spanish. The nicer you are to the staff, the more they return that favor x 10. I think that is what many of the bad reviews were lacking. -Topless beach. Yep. New thing for me to see...about 1 of 20 women were topless (usually laying out) on the entire beach (about 12 different resorts). Nothing too big of a deal. I suggest for US guys to wear shades so you don't get caught peeking... -If you go down there and come across Francisco the bartender or Joswe the waiter, tip them well as I am sure you will see how great of a job they do. They work normally from 11am to 11 pm, (most employees work 12 hour shifts). -There are other things I could write, but this review is already way too long, but a saying they have down there is \"Nobody knows you, and nobody cares!\" Which means let go and have a good time. You get out of the vacation what you put into it. If you are a bump on a log and want someone always catering to you, go somewhere else. The recreation staff (Animacion team) is always trying to get people into activities and have fun. -One last thing: I can understand why some of the world does not like Americans. I observed too many people from the US being rude and drinking WAY too much. We tried to be a bit of an Embassador of the US...which really wasn't too hard. Simply being polite and not making fun of Mexican, European, or South American people isn't too hard, but you would be surprised at how many were embarrassing themselves and the US.

I had read some people were not thrilled about the steak or seafood restaurant, but we found the steak restaurant of good quality too. Because it has a bit more \"romantic\" setting, the steak restaurant is worth the effort especially if you are there for an extended stay or want a change from the buffet. Also, the cookouts on the beach were fun and tasty. Lots of meat options grilled fresh right close to your lounge chair was a nice option for lunch. The beach as many have noted is awesome, so I won't elaborate more. The hotel staff was quite friendly and responded to every request we made. Our initial room smelled overtly like smoke, so we asked for a transfer which occured within minutes. We also had to ask for wash cloths twice, one time it was addressed immediately. The other I remedied by finding a maid who assisted me. Overall they were very attentive to my needs. Why not an excellent rating then? I agree the in-room refridgerator should be re-stocked daily. It wasn't the alcohol that was the problem for us. It was the water bottles. Even though you could get it easily enough, the convenience of it being ready and cool would have been excellent. We learned a simple trick about the third day that an empty water bottle on the bed with a $1 under it would fill the fridge every time. The pool bar tended to serve the women first no matter the order you arrived which I found annoying (although I understood to some degree for courtesy). Most of the time though, you were served immediately as there was no rush at the bars.

Keep in mind that this is in comparison to other resorts in the area. Here is what I experienced and can validate as true: 1. The lunch and dinner buffet food is not very good, but not terrible. I would say that you get what you pay for, but it's not true. You are much better off dining in town. We experienced wonderful meals in Playa del Carmen and they were very reasonable and much better than the food at RIU Playa car. 2. The service at the RIU is terrible. Yes it is Mexico, but if you advertise as 5 star you better be all that and more. Mini bar should be stocked daily not every 3 to 4 days. If there is a dispute, it should be resolved quickly. Ours involved stolen luggage and was never resolved. We were never given the room upgrade we were promised and they didn't care. You also need to figure out for yourself how to sign up for signature restaurants, rentals, etc. A more active and informative concierge would be helpful. 3. Yes, the rooms are a bit musty. I don't hold this against them. Our room was not that bad and it is the jungle. But, our view was of the next building over. You can't do any better for honeymooners? Come on. 4. Yes, the beds are hard. Again, I don't hold this against them. All beds are hard in Mexico. 5. The lunch area smells of stale beer. This should be addressed. Again, not worthy of the 5 star rating. Overall, I need to give this a 1 out of 5. If it was advertising itself as an average resort I would give it a 2 or 3. This is not a luxury resort, and unless they make dramatic changes, it never will be.

We were there from May 22nd to May 26th. Just needed a short getaway. Would I recommend this resort? Yes. It really depends on what you are looking for. Best things about it: If you are a lay on the beach type, you're in heaven. Beautiful grounds and very well kept. This place is clean, clean, clean. When I first walked into my room, I noticed that the floors shined. I assumed that it just looked clean. The next day I noticed that they mop the floors daily. They even pull out the beds from the walls and mop behind stuff. I was throughly impressed. Great customer service. I thought that a belt was missing from my room, it turns out that I left it at home (duh). They launched a full investigation for my belt. I found out that it is their policy to search all employees each night before leaving to make sure that things don't walk. The entertainment was fair to good. The Michael Jackson show was very good. The Playacar is smaller than the other hotels, and we found that we liked it better. They have a wide variety of food. It is eatable and decent, but we found that we were never looking forward to lunch or dinner. For most people, it is just fine. We're just kind of picky about eating really well on vacation. We always do cruises, and this was our first resort. So in all fairness, I'm not sure what to compare it to. We had a good relaxing vacation, but I wouldn't go back only because of our food preferences. Everything else really was great. On a score of 1-10, the playacar is a 7. The biggest benefit that I see is that you get so much for your dollar. It is an excellent value. Things to keep in mind. Bring American singles. Although not required, we tipped our housekeeper $2 per day. As I mentioned before, we received excellent service. I won't go into the details of the things that I requested, but they remembered everyday without being reminded. Bring insulated mugs, a clock, shampoo, soap. We bought a $10 mexican calling card to phone home. It's $7 per minute from your room. Yes, the beds are hard, but I found they were okay. There is a smell, but that's Mexico. After awhile it goes away. I bought plugs-ins and candles and only used the plug in. The biggest things to look out for are the timeshare people. These people are so slick. As we got off the plane, people who look very official approached us. (Keep in mind, everyone who works in the airport looks official.) We managed to get past all the people approaching us, but right across from getting our baggage there were people from behind the desk calling us over. We told them we wanted to get our bags, they said no you have to come here first. Asked for our baggage claim ticket, wrote something on it, and proceeded to smoothly tell us about the area and what we should do. Finally after about 5 minutes, he goes into why we need to go to a meeting at the Mayan Palace. We then realized that he was a timeshare guy too. (We thought that we were so smart.) On the beach they approach you, but they are very nice when you say no. Just a note: Many women on the beach go topless.

This was our second trip to Playa del Carmen, the first to a Riu Hotel. We absolutely loved the resort. It was a beautiful place with a huge, spectacular beach. The food was better than we expected. Dinners were excellent, great variety and great taste. We ate at the \"steakhouse\" one evening and had a great time. The only minor issue we had was the lunch, food was good, the variety of selection could have been better over 7 days. Our room on the third floor of building 3 was very nice, very clean. We ran low on bottled water a few times, one call got our room restocked quickly. The nightly entertainment was better than we were prepared for, 3 shows were excellent. A few points: 1)Due to the insane amount of comments about musty odor we brought a plug in air freshener, which was a good idea. Our room had a slight musty smell when we arrived, but this was expected since the buildings are open air and you are in the tropics on the ocean. 2)We did bring 24 oz insulated mugs, which is a great idea for taking a cold drink to the beach, the bartenders are happy to clean them and fill them. 3)Bring lots and lots of sunscreen, we could not believe the number of fools that obviously did not wear enough or any and looked like lobsters their second day of vacation. 4) Topless sunbathers on the beach were fewer in number than our last trip, max was 10 at a time, which included my wife. We theorized the reasons for fewer were more Americans, and the internet. 5)Service and Tipping. The service from every member of the staff was outstanding. The bartenders move at the speed of light, never waited more than a minute for a drink. Contrary to many postings I have read which made it sound like everyone tips, we did not tip any of the hotel staff. I can count on one hand how many tips I saw people give to bartenders and dinner hosts over seven days. We believe in the all-inclusive system, we did not tip last time and got great service, and we got excellent service again this time. 6)Ask for \"name brand\" liquor with your drinks. Instead of Pina Colada, ask for Pina Colada with Bacardi, or Margarita with Cuervo. If you don't tell them what liquor you want, you get the house brand which is, uh, not very tasty.

We were there April 24 - 28, 2004. My wife and I are early 40's and left the kids with the grandparents at home. The staff was very friendly and courteous, always saying \"hola\" when you passed them. I would classify the food as very good and better than I expected. There was a wide, wide variety at every meal at the buffet and it was different every night we were there. The only problem was that I overate! I will say that they don't serve very much beef, but I stuck with the fish, chicken and pork and was happy. We made reservations one night for the seafood restaraunt and we were pleased with the food and the service. The breakfast and lunch buffets were also very good. They have a omelet station for breakfast and have a bacon, sausages, breads, fruit, fresh juices, etc as well as cheeses and cold cuts (very European). We walked one day to the Yucatan and it was the same lunch, but good just to be in a different place. The mix of guests was an interesting mix of North and South Americans and Western Europeans, especially Dutch and German. I didn't find anyone to be arrogant or obnoxious (except the drunk guy in the hallway at 3:00 am one night). We were glad we read some other reviews and we brought our own soap and shampoo. We didn't bring an insulated mug and were OK, but we spent more time at the pool than the beach, if you are going to be at the beach a lot, bring one for your drinks. Also bring some slippers or house shoes to wear in the room because the tile floors could be cool, especially after the maids cleaned them. We didn't do any tipping at all except a small tip for the maid. I saw some people tipping at the pool bar, but only a small minority, it wasn't expected, and nobody at the resort will hit you up for a tip. They give you \"towel cards\" to trade in for beach towels, so you always have fresh towels for the pool or beach. The only show we saw was the Michael Jackson show and it was pretty impressive. We took two trip while there (booked through our Apple Vacation reps at the hotel). We went on the \"Snorkeling Adventure\" where you go to a park and snorkel along a barrier reef. This is a full day trip. You snorkel in two different places, have lunch and relax, then go out one more time. It's \"all inclusive\" there and they serve beer and drinks, bottled water and the lunch was good. We also went on the \"Zip Line\" where you go into the jungle, swim and snorkel in the large sinkholes and birdwatch, check out caves, see a Mayan shaman, and then slide on these metal ropes over the jungle. This was a very different experience from the normal touristy stuff and if you are a little adventurous I would recommend it. This was a half day trip, but they give you lunch as well. Bring money to tip on the trips, not only is it expected, but the trip guides do a great job and you will want to tip them and be generous.

People who think they are reviewing the RIU Playacar are quite frankly, telling more about themselves than the resort--and sometimes the picture is not pretty. My wife and I have stayed at the RIU Playacar approximately 10 -12 times and are booked for May 12-19. We have lived in Europe and traveled most European countries as well as Asia and of course most of our great states including HI and AK. We have also been on seven cruises. Apparently, most of the negative reviewers have never before ventured past the county line and at best, it was a first visit out of the good ole US of A. 98% of the negative complaints you read hear are totally unwarranted. These folks would not know a good beach, a nice room, quality food and quality service, even if it were biting them on the backside. All hotel rooms (regardless of cost), homes, stores, outbuildings and other structures in and around the ocean and humidity smell musty. Second and third floors are farther from earth so they don't smell so much but then people complain because they have to climb the stairs. The smell has never bothered us in the least and never will. If you want to avoid the musty smell, don't go near the beach or jungle or Mexico or the equator\u2014just stay in your back yard. Mexican beds are hard. That's just a Mexican bed--they like it that way. We usually sleep far more there than at home. If you have to have a bed just so-so, stay with yours. Visitors at the RIU Playacar are comprised of about 80% Europeans, 15% Canadians, and 5% Americans. Anyone who has been to Europe knows that they like to wear less in the sun. Men don't seem to mind this (dah) and once American women realize the topless ladies are not a threat to their marriage, they don't mind it either. Sure, all people are not perfectly shaped and just like reviews, some are prettier than others\u2014so what! Sometimes it's that 5% at the RIU Playacar that brings us to question the values of the \"good ole American way\". Once you travel outside, you understand that it\u2019s not the rest of the world that\u2019s different\u2014it\u2019s the Americans. Sure the RIU Palace and other resorts are nicer but you pay much more for it. If you must have a disco or, your arm band gets you into the Yucatan or Tequila (not Palace). The lady who said all the people from the Tequila pour onto the beach was wrong; that's at the Yucatan. We\u2019ve been there all times of the year and never has it been crowded. The size of the RIU Playacar is great and anyone who's stayed at the Yucatan will certainly appreciate the fact that you don't have to \"take a hike\" to the beach. The buffets are wonderful for the 5th through 95th percentile guests. The complaints about the food are from the other 10% who find fault with their grandmother's cooking or consider McDonalds to be fine cuisine. There are some complaints about the dining \u201cschedule\u201d. All cruises serve dinner on \u201cschedule\u201d, that is you may choose to eat at 6:30 or 8:30 or whatever. You don\u2019t have to wait in line to get reservations your first morning. Just show up at either 6:30 or 8:30 and tell the maitre d' how many nights and he will seat you and you claim that seat and time for the rest of your stay. Really tough isn\u2019t it! Do remember long pants for men for dinner. All nicer resorts require this. If you want the most of everything in a vacation for the least amount of money, you will be very happy at the RIU Playacar, unless of course you don\u2019t like your grandmother\u2019s cooking.

Other Riu hotels had long walks between and long waits at buffet lines and bars.3) Take insulated mugs ($4 at Walmart). I would pour a beer from my room refrigerator into mug and take it to pool or beach and it would stay cold for over an hour.4)Did combo Xel-Ha/Tulum side-trips. Don't book in hotel ($94) book across street at strip mall($74) Both places were nice, but everything took longer because of logistics of picking up other guests. Might be better to rent car and go on your own. We ended up spending 2 hours at Tulum (Mayan ruins) and 3 hours at Xel-ha. Probably need 6 hours to do Xel-ha right. Snorkeling was great (more fish by the dam) and rafting was good.5) Entertainment was better at the Tequilla. You can go there since it is a Riu hotel. We did 3 nights at Playacar (Michael Jackson and Grease are best shows) and 3 nights at Tequilla. I didn't expect much in the way of entertainment, but it was probably the weakest point of staying at the Playacar.6) Food was generally good. Lots to choose from. My favorites were the bacon and omelets at breakfast and the oysters at dinner. Stay on the buffet line. We booked on night at the Steak restaurant and it was horrible. Maybe because we are from Kansas City where the best steaks in the world are from, but looking at everyone elses meals, I would give it about a 4 (out of 10) Buffet line is about an 8 or 9.7) smell in rooms: We were on first floor in bldg 3. We didn't have any smell, but our neighboring room did. So, check out your room when you first get there, and if you don't like it for any reason, get another one. They don't mind.

Oh well, we got free tours and free gifts, so it wasn't a complete waste of time. Also, keep your eyes on your valuables (purses, pocketbooks, etc.) when going thru security at the Cancun airport. My wife let the security screener look through her purse while another screener checked her shoes. We were over the Gulf of Mexico before she realized that $80 in cash was missing from her pocketbook.

Thanks to the previous visitors we made the selection to stay at the Riu Playacar. The facilities were not overwhelming as we had seen at other resorts and that was nice. We had the choice of using the other Riu properties in the area, and although they were very similar it was comfortable. The hotel is very close to Play del Carmen and the ferry port to Cozumel.Close to the shopping in PdC. There are special restaurants each hotel had each evening for which you must sign up. We were planning to go on Valentine's day and but tried the steak house on the Friday before. Ok, someone wrote a while back this was nothing to write home about and that was correct. The ribeye was one tough piece a beef. So after that we stuck to the wonderful buffet.The buffets were good and depending on how you pace yourself you won't get tired of them after 7 days.If your goal is a golf vacation and you are serious about the game, then Cancun is not the place to go, but if you enjoy the game and are willing to sit through a 90 min presentation by the Palace Resorts folk, then it is free. Although I enjoyed the 9 holes before dark, it was good. Now the people we played with were not happy with the course etc, Oh well. On the side, the pro shop is pricy.We talked to various groups and decided on Suntrips. We were pleased with the package. Not sure about the level of support once there and are on the tours. Some from the group took some Apple trips for the day because they offered more. Our goal was to be on the beach and take a couple of trips. The only downside was that the temp was lower than expected and it did rain more (5 out of 7 days). The locals were saying this was unusual for this time of year.

We are both experienced travelers, she is a Leisure Travel Agent and I am a Sales Manager, and we were totally impressed with the staff and service at this hotel. The resort has a small quaint feeling to it and is quite an impressive complex. The hotel was originally going to give us a ground floor room in the building closest to the lobby and we requested and were given a room in the building closest to the pool and beach. The rooms are large and well appointed with a mini-bar, refrigerator and safe. The rooms smell like any resort that is situated close to salt water and is located in a humid tropical environment. Once you have turned on your ceiling fan and adjusted your air conditioning, the rooms are very comfortable. The bars of soap are very small so you may want to bring your own bar of soap for showering. We were told that the guests were approximately 60% European, 30% U.S., and 10% from Latin America. Most of the staff speak fluent English and they are very friendly and accomodating. The guests are courteous but keep in mind that U.S. citizens are not the dominant clients here. The key to having a great vacation is being flexible and learning from your experiences. If you bring your children, be prepared to notice that the European women like to sun bathe without any tops on. There were a lot of children at the resort and the hotel has a professional recreation staff to keep them busy with activities. The food and drinks (alcohol) were very good. The buffets at breakfast, lunch and dinner had a large assortment and on Wednesday the hotel served the largest peel and eat shrimp that we have ever seen. Make sure that you have dinner at the steakhouse. For dinner we had: an assortment of hot appetizers, caeser salad, tomato bisque, rib eye steak with baked potatoe and vegetables, and for desert a baked alaska. The shopping center across the street is very nice and on Saturday night there were tables set up in the hotel complex on the path to the beach where you could buy hand made crafts. Playa Del Carmen is only a $4 U.S. cab ride away and is a fun place to shop. Cozumel is a $19 roundtrip ferry ride away fron Playa Del Carmen and has more of an upscale shopping environment. If you like to bargain and negotiate while you shop, the shops in Playa Del Carmen and Cozumel will be fun for you. We found that 50% off of what they quote you the first time on some items is a reasonable amount to pay.

I had heard and read that the beaches were better and it was more laid back than Cancun. We loved the Riu Cancun, but found the beach to be a little small for us. We love to take long walks on the beach. We again traveled with Sun Trips with no complaints. They have this down and their charter service, Ryan Air is quite good. Again we got to Cancun and went through immigration and customs quite quickly. Playa del Carmen is about 45 minutes to an hour from the airport. Last time it took us almost the same amount of time to get to the Riu Cancun because it is one of the last stops and the bus stopped at a lot of hotels. Our bus was fill mostly with people staying at one of the four Riu's there. The road we came in on cuts the Riu Tequilla off from the other Rius (you will have to cross the street if you stay at the Tequilla to get to the beach). It was dark, but the hotels were well lit and in fact had some Christmas lights already up on their trees. We checked into the Riu Playacar and went over to get a time for dinner. They didn't have any seating available for the early setting so we were giving a table at the 8:30 PM setting. THE ROOM. We were checked into room 1102. It was almost the closest one to the lobby area. The room was a normal hotel room, although these Rius are a little short on storage space. We did smell the \"smell\" you read about in many of these reviews. This was to become a major problem. It is not a musty smell, but really a swampy smell. It wasn't too bad when we checked in, but the second night I woke up and it smelled like a skunk was in the bathroom. It was coming from the drains. They sent someone over who drained the drains and it was pretty good--for about two more days. Then the smell came back. We moved at this time to room 3212. We again smelled was there, but not too bad. Tip #1. Your room will have an odor. If it is too bad, get to heigher ground (second or third floor). You may also want to bring some air fresheners or even some lemon scented drain cleaner. The room was kept spotless by the chambermaid. She would leave little (and big) animals made out of the towels and even the extra blankets. The TV's at the Riu Playacar did not have timers on them (unlike the Riu Cancun), but the stations were the same, so there are adequate english speaking channels. Again there were no clocks in the room and the soap and shampoo left a lot to be desired, which leads us to our next tip. Tip #2. Bring a couple of bars of soap, your own shampoo, and a clock if you want one in the room. The Riu Playacar only has showers in the room and the bathmat is about 12inches by 24 inches. I got out of the shower the second day there and the tiles had gotten wet. Zoom, I went down like a bowling pin. After I told the management about this, they sent up a rubber mat (like the ones you have in a bathtub or shower so you don't fall there). We placed it right outside the shower and it worked well. Tip#3. Watch your step in the bathroom. Wet Mexican tile is as slippery as ice. FOOD. We were really impressed by the food at the Riu Cancun. I would have given them a 4 out of 5. The food at the Playacar was similar, but I only would give it a 3.5 out of 5. You didn't quite have as much of a selection and lunch was someone boring. It didn't make any difference where you ate for breakfast or lunch, the menus were all the same. We did eat breakfast at the Riu Tequilla one morning. The facilities at the Tequilla were quite pretty and I thought their buffet room was nice. They had artificial flowers on all the tables and the paintings on the wall made for a very nice room. The Playacar was a bit simpler. Dinner, however, was very good. We had Turkey on Thanksgiving and nice cuts of beef most other nights. Jackie really like the seafood station where the shrimp were. I had grown quite addicted to the butter pecan ice cream at the Riu Cancun, but found they only had it about half the time at the Playacar. As always the wine, left a lot to be desired (at least the first glass did). Tip#4. I found that they didn't have bacon at breakfast (only sauage). We were eating first thing (at 7 AM). Once morning I went back in to get some juice and found they did have bacon. Apparently they weren't putting it out at first. I also found the station by the breads that had Mexican foods had the best cooked bacon (less greasy). The steak house/seafood restaurant. You can make reservations for the steak house/ seafood restaurant. These are side by side and are both open air. We ate twice at the steak house. There is a varied menu at both with each have about 6 entrees. You are serve appetizers first, then salad. then the entree, and finally dessert. We only ate there twice for two reasons. We found we got too much food and the buffet was really excellent too. Tip #4. You have to make reservations in the morning at breakfast if you want to eat at either of these restaurants. I did not see anyone rejected. I think they simply want to know how many to expect. Don't worry if you eat late. There will be room at the sitdown restaurants. THE BEACH. Here is where the Rius in Carmen del Playa shine. This was probably the best beach I've ever seen (and we have traveled extensively including many trips to Hawaii). The beach is huge. The sand is cool even in the heat of the mid day. There are ample beach lounges and you can sit in the sun or the shade. We prefer the shade (we catch the sun on our walks on the beach). As you walk from the rooms to the beach, you will find the shadiest spots to be on the right hand side. We liked being perhaps 20 feet in front of the massage hut right next to the fence. There are a number of trees there and after 9 AM you had shade all day. To the left you have the boats and the building for the watersports. You will have to fill out a release form to use the boggie boards, Hobie Cats, peddle boats, kayaks, etc. and once you do they punch your braclet. We used the Hobie Cats three times during the six days we were there. Once day we didn't feel like it. Another day there was no wind and on the third day there was too much wind. But sailing is fun and easy. The water temperature is amazing. When you are on the boat the water laps up and it is actually warm. The nights are relatively cool and early in the moring when we were walking on the beach, the water temperature was warmer than the air temperature. You can walk about a mile towards Playa del Carmen (left--south). At that point we could have continued further, but you had to wade out into some surf to go on. There are a couple of beautiful homes on the way (check out the one with the bedroom facing the ocean). Gong right (north) you can also walk over a mile. You finally get up to some rocks and there is an interesting path through the rocks which agains requires you to wade through some surf to go farther. If you like walks on the beach, you'll love this beach. Tip #5. They open reservations for the Hobie Cats at 9 AM. If you are there then, you will have your pick of times. Tip #6. If you want a massage on the beach, ask them if they have any \"specials.\" Most of the time they do. Tip #7. Bring an insullated mug with you for the beach. We got two twenty ounce mugs from Walmart for $3.60 and it was one of the best things we brought with us. Just had it to the bartender and they will fill it up. Tip #8. You may be approached on the beach by time share sales people. They will try to get you to come view a property. We were offered two round trip tickets to Cuzomel, a Mexican blanket, a bottle of tequilla, etc. to visit one. Be nice, these guys are just trying to make a living. But if you aren't interested, just tell them thanks, but no thanks. SHOPPING. There is a nice little shopping area just across the street from the Riu Playacar. No real bargains there, but very handy. We used the internet cafe to keep in touch. Costs $1 USD per 10 minutes. Playa del Carmen is also a nice little shopping town. Again, you won't find the \"best\" mexican prices, but some nice shops and some interesting items. We did in fact find some \"overpriced\" stores, selling things for more than you would pay in the states. The walk to Playa del Carmen was a nice one. Just long enough to work a few caleries off. The bottom line. We wouldn't go back to the Riu Playacar until they fix the smell problem. However, in spite of it, we had a great time and will be looking for other properties in the area.", "Date": "December 5, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot impressed with RIU\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1492931", "Content": "Just returned from the Riu Playacar.

The room was nice, but to have my balcony on the ground floor was like staying on the promanade deck of a cruise ship, everybody walks by your room. We told them we didn't like being there, so they switched us to the 3rd floor and it was much nicer. Although we left a tip for the maid every day, we always had to call for soap or towels or our mini bar. I have stayed in all inclusives in Mexico before, but I never felt like I was on a schedule. Don't like the way you have to have a schedule for dining and that for the majority of the day, there is only one restuarant open at a time. Also, only one bar open besides the pool swim up bar. Not good. I would not go back because they really don't have much to offer for an all inclusive, expect for nice rooms, but not all that great.

We were married on the 4th and after the reception went directly to the Airport as happy newlyweds. We checked in with no problems but hoped that with our marriage certificate in hand...possible for a free upgrade....nope..would cost us extra$$...no thanks..just thought we'd ask. Unfortuately we saw the next pair of newlyweds ask for free upgrade at the boarding gate....they got it. We were quite disappointed having asked 3 hours earlier....oh well though....we were just happy to be going on our Honeymoon. The flight was fine but struggled for some leg room.. Arrived in Cancun , beautiful. Arrived at the RIU....small resort but very nice. I had previously emailed the hotel directly, weeks prior requesting 3rd floor and making sure they knew we were going to be there for 2 weeks and it was our honeymoon... Checking in...we were given first floor. I mentioned the emails....showed our wedding certificate...and was told to check out the first floor first and perhaps he could move us if we didnt like it. Well we didnt like it...... An hour later we were moved to the second floor. No view, no fruit basket(states in brochere all honeymooners receive this with tequila) YIKES WE THOUGHT!!! OH WELL...we said again...smiling at each other and looking at the 2 double beds...no king bed either. The room was ok....it did have the 'smell' but it wasnt overbearing. The shower (no tub) was nice and the mirror space area was great. Now the beds....hard hard hard........not so nice. The A/C was great but we never did have our pop and water re-stocked for 4 days....had to go to the front desk and ask what the deal was...they sent someone over within 30 minutes. Somedays we didnt have new towels replaced, which was annoying when I got out of the shower and EEEK..no towels. Another call to the desk...30 minutes later towels delivered. Housekeeping shows up at 0830-0900 daily...make sure you use your do not disturb sign if you like to sleep in.... But the noise generating throughout the building usually wakes you starting at 0800 anyways. Not nice. They have one buffet restaurant for breaky and dinner...for 2 weeks we thought this may be a problem...it wasnt, the food was always yummy especially the PRAWNS! We booked one night at the Seafood restaurant and was DISGUSTED. The food appeared to have been pre-made and sat under heat lamps...I was ill for 24 hours after that night. Not nice. I didnt hear anything good about that retaurant from others either. We decided NOT to do the steakhouse since being sick. The buffet was fine for us. The beach itself, sand and warm bluey green surf was breathtaking. Lots of loungers and beach volleyball. No bar on the beach, disappointing and unusual being at an all inclusive. ?? LOTS OF TIME SHARE PEOPLE AND VENDORS on OUR BEACH, very very annoying and disappointing. We kayaked, used the pedal boats and boogie boards available...fun and great exercise(we tend to eat to much on holidays) hah. We went to COZUMEL and rented a old convertible bug...herbie and drove the island stopping at various beaches and had a blast! WORTH THE 80.00$$. NOTE:Hubby normally gets sea sick on ferry's....the ferry to cozumel is not so smooth but he took some meds prior and was fine. We also went to XEL-HA booked thru our hotel...didnt do the TULUM part...thankfully as we needed all day to fully enjoy XEL-HA.. We also bought the all-inclusive drink/eat pass for 29.00 and WELL WORTH IT....the margarita's were fantastic! Xel-ha was awesome....the cave snorkeling and little inlets.....cliff jumping...tubing...great adventure. The hotel nightlife no good, the shows were boring for us(the Bahia Akumel was excellent for shows).....if you like a bar night, you can go to the TEQUILA property..heard it was fun. We used the internet cafe at the Tequila...only 6$ for an hour....good deal. We met another couple from Canada who was on our flight into Cancun and had a blast....although we learned from them that they had their travel agent put on their reservation:HONEYMOONERS....so they got the suite on the third floor for free when they checked in.....but they told us they werent honeymooners(married for 3years)....they also didnt have to show their marriage certif to the front desk!!!! SO IF YOU ARE HONEYMOONERS, MAKE SURE YOU MAKE YOUR AGENT PUT THAT ON UR RESO!!!!! urgh. Overall...what did we think..... we wont be going back to that resort... Personally we loved Punta Cana in the Dominican Rep. for it's culture and people. The RIU needs to get a handle on the time share vendors and upgrade the customer service levels.

The weather was nice..rained once, but it was brief and did not interfere with plans. It was hot and humid as was expected. We asked for a 3rd floor room to avoid the smells we had heard about. No problems with that, but realized there was no elevator. No biggie. The view........NONE! This was the single most disappointing thing about the way this property is designed. When I go on a tropical vacation I want to see the beach! At least some palm trees! Every room faces another building on this property. Even though we weren't in the room much, it's just the principle! I wouldn't come back to this hotel because of that. On the plus side...The rooms, buildings, grounds, and beach are very nice. I didn't like the beach being such a journey from our hotel room though! It was very clean and the water was the most amazingly clear water I have ever seen. Looks and feels like bath water! The rooms are clean and the landscaping is finely manicured. The fridge in the room is fully stocked with water, soda, beer, and there is also bottles of liquor in the room as well. NO COKE PRODUCTS! Another disappointment. I paid for all inclusive and had to pay for \"Coke Cola Light\" across the street, which is their version of Diet Coke. It was drinkable but took getting used to. I seriously don't understand how Coke and Pepsi allow this country to destroy the flavor of their beverages. I got a Diet Pepsi at dinner and almost puked on the first sip. It was truly the most disgusting soda I've ever tasted. I couldn't drink it. I would love to know why this is? Because I am talking REALLY REALLY BAD!!! No matter what brand of soda I had down there, they were all pretty bad. Diet, non-diet, it didn't matter. The mixed drinks were good to me, but I don't like the flavor of strong drinks. For people who want strong drinks, tip more or drink more! The food was great because of the variety, but we only stayed 4 days. If I'd stayed longer it would have gotten old. It was annoying trying to figure out the whole meal thing, but once we did it was okay. The Steak House takes reservations only, which is also annoying because I am not a morning person (especially when I'm on vacation) and you have to make your reservation around 7 am to get a seat. We almost didn't get to eat there, but did on the last night and enjoyed it. You might want to bring your own snorkeling gear...you only have an hour to use the ones at the dive shop. Buying them in Mexico is $25 and up when you can get them cheap (about $10) at your local Walmart or Target. There is quite a few water sport activities on site that are free. We did not do any of the ones that cost anything. Shopping across the street is very nice. I liked it better than going into Play del Carmen because people are way too pushy there and practically grab you and pull you into their stores. Once you're in there, you may not get out for awhile due to high pressure sales. You need to tell them to buzz off because you probably won't talk them into any real good deals anyway. They didn't have too many things I couldn't find at home there, and the prices are outrageous! I thought I was going to get great deals on silver and realized it was cheaper to buy it at home. I only got a decent deal on a hammock. These people are con artists and will rip you off whenever possible. My first purchase was put on my credit card. They took advantage of my naivity and charged me $75 for an item which was $7.50! I was pissed! Make sure you fully understand the pesos and check your receipts prior to leaving the store! Another tip is to pay for as much as possible with your credit card since American dollars are worth so much more than theirs. That's why they prefer you to pay with cash. Well, say you buy a $5 item and give them a $20 bill. Most of the time they will give you change in pesos..so you just got ripped off big time. The more you do this, the more money you are giving away. Some places only take cash, so bring some, but request change in US currency. Sometimes they'll do it for you, but don't expect it. Time share people are vacation killers! We were warned to stay away and did. Then we got suckered by a slick liar who told us he was going to sell us a snorkeling trip. We were on our way to the ferry to go to Cozumel when he stopped us. These people are extremely sleazy! In short, we had big plans for our day, but were winging it as we went. He knew we wanted to snorkel. Then he found out we were going to Xel Ha the next day but didn't have tickets. He said if we go have a drink at this hotel down the street he'd give us all inclusive tickets to the park for $14 each, including transportation. This was going to save us approximately $80 or more. We had already missed the ferry we wanted so we figured we'd make the next one at 1 pm. Then he finds out we're not married....here's the sleazy part...he walks us to a shop a few doors down, has the guy in the store give us sterling silver bands to wear (and got to keep), tells us to tell the people at the hotel we're on our honeymoon, then tells us he could get fired if we told these people what he was doing. Next, we're in a car going to this hotel. The guy springs it on us that this will take about an hour and 15 minutes, then we'll get free t-shirts and our tickets. I was angry because we were already on a time frame to go snorkeling. He then says it was too late for snorkeling tours anyway. I was already seething. Then he gets out of the car and we continue to this hotel that's supposedly \"right down the street\". We ask the driver how far this place is and tells us 20 minutes. I about came unglued! When we got there we were then advised it's at least a 3 hour ordeal....now I'm ready to start ripping people's heads off. The hotel is the MUYAN PALACE....VACATIONERS BEWARE!!! This place is beautiful, but wan't even completed yet. It was a time shire scam. When we told our guide we weren't interested he called the manager over. These people just don't take no for an answer, and by now I'm starting to have violent tendencies. You have to get mean and hold your ground. I think I scared the lady manager because I picked up my purse, slammed it on the table (and my purse is heavy!) and said, \"WE ARE DONE! GET US OUR XEL HA TICKETS AND GET US A CAR TO TAKE US BACK TO THE FERRY NOW!!\" I had a few other choice words which I yelled to her as well. This was a FOUR HOUR NIGHTMARE!!! We did get our snorkeling tour in, and it was great, but had we not been roped in like idiots by that sleaze ball we would have had a much better one, I'm sure. At least we met another couple on the boat who also had their vacation day robbed by time share scabs, so we felt better knowing we weren't alone in the idiot department. We had other tentative plans for Cozumel which were foiled by the time share crap because we lost so much time. Xel Ha was nice and was the only good thing we got from the time share losers. The bus had too many stops to make though, and we didn't get there til 2 hours after the place opened. Then they pick you up an hour before it closes...so we were ready and the bus was very late! We did get to swim with dolphins there which was a dream come true for me! I highly recommend this for $95 a person! WOW!!! Experience of a lifetime..truly amazing! In a nut shell, 4 days was too short of a stay. We were rushed and never relaxed. Stay at least a week. Don't be afraid of being rude to the pushy sales people, they're rude anyway. Take heed: Whenever you're asked what hotel you're staying at by sales people, run..do not walk! They are time share people! Alot of the people seemingly selling tours are time share people in disquise! Know this! They can destroy a vacation and they are everywhere you go. They all seem to work for that godforsakin' Muyan Palace too! Unless you have the time to waste on this sort of thing, or are genuinely interested in buying into it, stay away from them! As for the Riu Playacar, it was a nice hotel overall. You can also use the facilities of the Yucatan and the Tequila, but we didn't have time to. My only real complaint was the view (or lack thereof) and no Coke products. The people are friendly and are easy to deal with as long you know spanish and/or they know english! Lots of topless women on the beach, so this may not be for you if you're offended by that sort of thing. Just remember you're in a different country and it's a different culture than here in the states.

We go to Mexico every year and had never done an all-inclusive and thought we would try it. We also wanted to visit another area in Mexico. It was the absolute worst vacation we have ever taken. We were so disgusted that we got back and booked a Sandals vacation just to shake the bad feelings off. First of all the line you have to stand in to book the dinner reservation is long and then fills up quickly. We finally got a reservation and when we ate there the ribs were raw on the back side. The most important issue was the room that stank so bad that I tried to sleep on the balcony to avoid the smell. The front desk sent someone up and they said that the smell was normal. NOT FOR ME. I HAVE STAYED IN MEXICO EVERY YEAR SINCE 1995 AND NEVER HAD ANY SMELLS LIKE THAT!! The power went out and that is pretty normal for the area but I was highly offended when we were \"lining up for dinner\" and the doors were closed and the help peered out of the curtain and laughed at the guest. The lights are out and it's dinnertime. Everyone went to eat at the same time and the line was long and so was the laughter of the employees. We booked snorkeling and stood around waiting and waiting only to find out that not enough folks booked and so they just canceled it without telling anyone. It is out in the boon-docks and we gladly hired a cab to take us, wait and bring us back so we could go to Cancun and get a decent meal and get away from the hotel. I certainly believe that someone can't count. It is not a five star by any standard that I have stayed at. More like a Motel 6 with a beach that by the way, you walk to a long way. The units face each other, so when you go out on you balcony you just look directly into someone else's balcony and it's very close. Drinks are all watered in my opinion. When I call with all the problems and there were many more than mentioned here, the front desk had a very nice woman but absolutely nothing resolved. I called Worry Free Vacations when I got back and they could care less. Gave me an offer to go back! Can you believe it! Go back for 2 days.

I would suggest going very early in the morning and doing it on your own in order to save time and money. I would recommend X-Caret and Xel-ha.

We found the reception very friendly. Others had complained about the smell in rooms. Keeping this in mind when we checked in they assinged us a room on the first floor. We went ahead and asked them for one of the third since reviews said the smell was less on the that fllor. We had to wait an extra five minutes and they were able to give us one. If you go this route remember one thing ( NO ELEVATOR). Not a big deal to us but it could be to others. Also maybe there was one and we just din't see it. So ask first. Our room didn't have a smell at all and we also had candles just in case. The room was very nice. At first we found the room didn't have a bath tub. So that was disappointing. But the large shower with the removeable showerhead and endless hotwater was very nice. The room had a stocked mini bar and a refrig. with sodas, beer and bottle water. Remember on thing sodas in Mexico don't taste the same. Not disgusting but I didn't like them. The water was nice to have. The floors in the room were ceramic and could get slick. I feel a lot of this is due to the shoes you wear. I wore sandle and had no problem when I wore my tennis shoes it could get slick. But in Mexico everywhere you go they have ceramic floors. The only real complaint I had about the room was no view at all. We faced the back of the restaraunt. If you are in to sitting on the balcony and looking out this is not the place for you. It just gets down to the design of th resort. Almost all rooms face the other buildings. But you are not in the room that much. So just think about that. We did find the beds hard and also the sheets and comforter were rougher. It was not a problem to us. I was so tired at the end of our days the ceramic floor would have felt great. We found the rest of the resort very nice. The people our very friendly and they are constantly cleaning this place. ( Another reason the floors our slick) The place was spotless. Talking to others who had stayed at other resorts I feel we probally had one of the nicest beaches The beach was very clean and nice. It was awesome. As far as food goes I liked it very much (ALL KINDS) there our two restaraunts at Riu Playacar and you can use other resatraunts at the other two resorts. We never did visit the other two resorts. you have basically a buffet style resateraunt ( El Porsche) and a set down and they serve you (The Steak House) both our great. Steak house more romantic. The buffet a endless supply of all kinds of food. You can eat from 7am to 1100 pm. You can also eat at the Riu Tequilla and Yucutan we never did. We stayed 4 nights. I feel the food could get old if we would had stayed longer but at least you could go to other places. Also they weren't picky on the dress code. So never being at an all inclusive place we were confused on how things worked. Such as when you eat and when you can't . Even as I'm back home I'm still confused. So at first it was aggrevating. The people don't understand you and you don't understand them. We were told many different things so it was very confusing and aggrevating to us. They have rules on what to do as far as seating and times. But what it gets down to in a nutshell is this when we were down there it wasn't crowded in the hotel at all so we pretty much just walk in and sit where we wanted to and ate. I guess if it during the season where it is crowded it doesn't work that way. Also we found on the last night at the steak house you have to make reservation. We didn't know that but again it wasn't crowded and they let us in anyways. Overall no big deal but it was very stressful trying to find out what to do. There is representives at the facility at certain times that our with who you book your vacation through. So talk them. Ours spoke english and helped us. You can also book your excursion you want to do through them also. As far as the water sports. Bring your own snorkel mask and tube!! Yes it is free there but only for one hour a day and that goes far the boogieboards, windsurfers, hobie crafts and kayacks too. Also before you can use the hobie crafts whick look like a lot of fun you have to take an hour lesson that cost $35.00. So even though it is free there our catches to it. For a hint to buy mask and goggles there around $30 - $50.00. So get them at Wal Mart for about $10.00 and bring them. TRUST ME ON THIS! We did snorkel on our beach and saw a few things it was neat and we did use the boogie boards ( No waves though) and the kayacks were fun. You also can rent wave runners and also parasail at the beach. As far as excursions go. I really don't know what to tell someone to do. We were told buy people to do thing on your own. Its cheaper. The people at the hotel such as your representive will tell you to book through them. ( They make a couple of bucks) no big deal. So do your shopping if you have time. Saying this leads me to this story. They will tell you to stay away from time share people. Take thier word. DO IT!!! These people almost destoyed our vacation. First off we decided to wing it and do the tours on our own. Which really consist of going when you want to and find your own ride to get their. That is the big diffrence in a nutshell. We don't like following other people and going when they tell us and leaving when they tell us. When we went shopping the first couple of days we avoided talking to anyone who was trying to book a snorkel trip, xel ha, atv tours etc. etc.. On our third day we decided to go to Cozumel. Once getting their we would decide on what to do. Rent a jeep go snorkeling our do both. The ferry leaves every hour up to 10:00 pm. We were walking to the ferry aroudn 11:30 am to catch the 12:00 ferry. It takes about 40 minutes to get their. Alosn the last ferry back to Playa De Carmen come back at 9:00pm. Whild walking down to the ferry a man approached us and asked us what we wanted to do when we got over their. We told hime we were interested in snorkleling. So he invited us in to book a trip threw him. Being stupid we listen to him. We said what the heck we are going over there to that so while we have time before the ferry leaves lets book something now and save time. What a joke. We were tole that it was too late to go snorkeling and that the last trip left at 11:00 am and their was no other snorkel trips through anyone. Well we were planning to visit Xel Ha the next day so snorkiling at Cozumel was out of the question. Great. So he did tell us we could book Xel ha through him and he would save us some money. Xel- Ha all inclusive is $59.00 pp. He said if we visit a new hotel down the block and have a drink. We could purchase Xel -Ha tickets all inclusive $14.00 pp. So we said well since we can't go snorkling based on what your saying we have time. We'll go have a drink and just catch the 1:00 ferry to Cozumel. Hey all we have to do is have a drink and hey they just want us to wear the Free t-shirt they will give us when we get back to the US to advetise the new hotel. What is so hard about that right. Well the man finds out were not married. No problem he just gave us two sterling silver rings and told us just tell them your on your honeymoon so I don't get fired. So at least the rings were free. Should have been clue #1 but hey were stupid. nExt thing you know the guy puts us in a car just to show us to the street we we well get picked up for the tour to Xel ha the next day. No problem. Well when we get their he gets out and instruck the driver to take us to the Mayan palace down the road. We also asked him how long would it take. He replied we would be back in 45 minutes. Great Cool we are going to save $80.00 for 45 minutes and we get free T-shirts and we already got free silver rings too. Well after about 10 minutes of driving we asked the driver how much farther and he ssaid about another 20-25 minutes. Lets just say there was almost one less Mexican in Mexico. Well we finally arrive and were just going to tell them we our Honeymoon and we have people waiting for us so give us our tickets and get us back. WRONG!! If you don't take the tour you can't get the tickets. Well the tour is 90 minutes they say. So well we can't snorkel so they said, We already basically wasted an hour for nothing. Lets see the tour. They did give us a representive that spoke english and actully played hockey for St louis. So we explained to him our make believe story of how we just got married and we need to get back. No problem this will take only 3 hours and well get you back he replies. Well we eventually get thrrough to him we had an hour and not three. So he did start to hurry to get things going. He showed us the resort very impressive but not what I came to Mexico to do. Well we see it and now it is time to sell us on it. So we know were not going to buy anything. He does his presentaion and yes it the 30 minute presentation it does make since. But I say hey let me take it home and think about it. Nope can't do that You have to put $5300 down right now. Well have I got done laughing We told him NO!! Well how about $2300 NO!!!! We explain hey your a nice guy but we are in a hurry we don't have time to think about this were on our honeymoon etc etc etc. Well he let us know our honeymoon wasn't a big deal but the rest of our lives at their facility is. HA HA Ha. Well he finally calls the manager over to say. Can you believe this... We our interest in the package we just don't like how much money to put down. OH MY GOD WHAT PART OF NO DIDNT YOU UNDERSTAND. Well now the manager has to let you know how stupid you are for not signing with them and they are going to cut us a deal. Well in five minutes we went from a $69,000 package and $5300 down to a $17,900 package no money down and $109.00 a month. Well when my girlfriend had enough and did everything but choke this lady we were finally able to leave. Well I must say we did get Two T-shirts and purchased a piece of paper that says we could get two tickets for $28.00 did come true. So the next worry is will they show. But anyways we got back and finally were able to catch the 4:00 pm ferry. A whole day wasted. Pretty much the only thing we could due is just shop we we already have done the first two days. Well we take the ferry over their and. Well when you get off the lead you to a tourist center YOU THINK. Well it isnt its another Time Share trap. Once again I think someone is being nice and trying to give us a map of Cozumel. Well in about 5 seconds my girlfreind catches on this was a time share scam too and tell them to shuff it. We did find this amusing. Well 25 yard down the walk to Cozumel we were stop buy to young Mexicans who offered to take us Snorkleling. The also informed us we could leave right then for $25.oo pp cash. We said what the Heck and also another couple arrived who just got ripped off of their day at another time share joined in and said hey the day is shot why not. Lets just say these two guys turned our whole trip around. They took us out for 2 1/2 hours all the beer we wanted and three different reefs. It was incredible. On the last reef we saw a huge sting ray and also a sea turtle it was an incredible experience and one I will not quickly forget. I would of gave these two guys $100.00 for this trip. So a bad day turned out for the best. The next day we had to catch the tour bus at the shopping center located across the street of the hotel at 9:25 am. Well it did show and took us to Xel -Ha the draw back is you have to make a few stops to pick up other people. So we didn't get to Xel-ha until 11:00 am and the tour bus leaves at 5:00 pm to go back. So not alot of time. The park is open 9:00 am to 6:00 pm. But I will say for $28.00 total we got our money worth. The park is very neat. The all inclusive gives you lockers, snorkle gear, all the food you can eat and drinks, and discounts on the optional tours that our their. We also swam with the dolphins their $90.00 pp for 45 minutes. Well worth it. DO IT!!! The snorkling was ok at Xel HA not as clear as Cozumel but we did see the parrot fish (HUGE) and some other very large fish. I don't know if I would have been happy if I would have paid the $59.00 pp price. I would have gain another three hours but I just don't know. I would recommend the park. The entrance fee for non inclusive is $25.00 than you rent the snorkel and lockers and othe things. I forgot how much. The park is all natural and very very beautiful. The bus picking us up was late getting their and we didn't get back to the hotel until around 7:00pm. So to wrap the review up I would say this. As far as the hotel goes. I liked it. Would I go back probally not just because I would like a view and I like to try different hotels. This is nothing against the hotel. It was worth the money and we loved the people. We our not big drinkers anyways but i felt that most drinks were strong. Other reviews say weak. I don't know. they were free and good. You know if there weak drink more. Clean place, awesome beach. You can't go wrong for the money, I feel. The boggest complaint we had was no view no iron our board. We brought our own iron and used a small table with glass in the room to iron. ( Difficult ). You probally could get a nicer resort with more things if you shop around for the same amount of money or maybe just a little bit more. If you already have booked you still won't be disapponted. The location is great 1.8 miles from Playa de Carmen. You can take a taxi for $4.00 one way. I think it was $5.00 to get to the ferry. the ferry to Cozumel is $15.00 pp round trip. As far as Mexico goes. Beautiful water best I have ever seen. I didn't like people always bothering you to buy things and trying to sell you trips. Very Polite though. I only had one person ask me for some change to get some beer and when I said no he shook my hand and told me to enjoy my stay in Mexico. So the people were very nice. The shopping I wan't impressed with. Yes their things that you dont see here but really no big bargains. The shopping at the plaza across the street from the hotel is just as good as in Playa De Carmen. EXCEPT FOR THE HAMMOCKS get them in Playa de Carmen. Overall We did do some very interesting things. As the title says it was Awsome and Aggrevation. Being the first time to Mexico it takes a few days to get use to how things work. I would suggest any first timers to go for a longer stay. Right when we figured how things work it was time to go. Also ignore most of the people that talk to you and they will leave you alone especiall if you are in a hurry to go somewhere. As far as the excursions get on the internet before hand and read up on them there is a lot of choices and see you representive at the hotel even if you don't book through him he still has what the places offer. Be prepared for some hidden cost. Most places due take visa but a lot don't so have cash. As far as Time Share goes. Ours did pay off and we save $80.00 I don't know if wasting three hours and how mad we were was worth it. But if you stay for a week and can take three to fours hours out of one of your days and you can say NO to these people you can save some money on an expensive excursion so use your judgement. When you have 4 days your just rushing all the time. I'm not in a hurry to get back to Mexico but in realistic turns I feel It was a learning experience. I did things with my girlfriend that I feel our once in a lifetime experiences so it was a very special trip for me. I think if we were to go back it would be a much better trip due to we understand how things work. So if you can afford it spend more time and I feel you will enjoy a better less aggrevating trip.

Playa del Carmen is a nice little beach town. There's plenty of shopping, and at night Captain Tutix is a great club to go dancing in. We also had a great time in Cozumel for the day. We took the ferry from Playa del Carmen, and then rented a jeep from Budget in Cozumel (55 USD). The beaches there are deserted and beautiful, and I hear that the best snorkeling is there.

For starters, your all-inclusive wrist band entitles you to eat, drink and play at two neighbouring Riu resorts only 200 meters away. This opens up certain other options. The resort is a leisurely stroll south along the beach from Playa del Carmen, past a half a dozen or so other resorts. We found nothing but the utmost care and attention to guest comfort and service, including a hospitality area for you to store your luggage and shower on departure day. Your wristband is not required to be turned in so use it all day even when you check out. The hotel itself is a statement to Spanish opulence with one of the grandest lobbies i've seen. Upon check-in you will be assigned a dining table which is yours for the duration. The food is nothing short of extraordiary, with a variety so vast that one could never even sample a bit of everything. Desserts, if you have room for them, are spectacular. There are several types of liquor bottles inverted in your bathrooms for ease of dispensing, all replenished regularly! In room safes, mini bars add to your convenience. I should think that the very few complainers forget that this is an emerging third world country and perhaps their lofty standards wouldn't be met regardless of where in the country they visited. This hotel is ranked 5 star and deserves every bit of it. If you plan to stay, make sure you email the hotel and be specific about your room. You'll want one facing the walkway, ground floor. The ones that don't face the walkway are in the rear and your view will be the next door resort's back doors and perhaps even the service entrance. I could go on and on so if you have anymore valid concerns or want some helpful tips, email me. One more thing....I've NEVER thought any of the drinks were weak!

Upon arrival we were greated with a delicious wine punch served in champagne glasses. But, I am afraid the it was downhill from there for the hotel. Our room, located on the first floor, was not only musty, (to be somewhat expected in Mexico), but it reeked of raw sewage. Traveling companions in other rooms complained of the same problem. The odor waifted up through the shower drain during the middle of the night, so we woke up to a most unpleasant smell. The beds are probably the hardest and dampest I have ever laid on in all my travels. (Notice I did't say slept on, because I was so uncomfortable I didn't get a wink of sleep the four miserable nights I spent there). And, being from a costal area, I am used to dampness. The food is very European and served buffet style. It was mediocre, not gourmet at all. But, you can make a dinner reservation to eat the evening meal resturant style, if you get up early enough to beat the others. The meals we ate when we did make a reservation were better quality. But, in the Riu's defense, there is American television in the room, the inclusive price does include alcohol (some resorts charge extra for this), and I found the grounds to be very tropical and well kept. The water is clear blue and the beaches were powdery. Palm trees lined the beach for shade and there was lots of fun and follicking by staff members. Overall, my opinion is that if you don't care what your room is like, and delicious food is not of the utmost importance to you, then this is a good place to stay.

Again I agree with NJ about the butts on the beach. This last time was the worst I have ever seen. But not to the point that I wouldn't go back. I have contacted the resort with this concern. I have a hard time with the fact that people use the beach as an ashtray. But over all this is a great resort and they are constantly looking for ways to improve. I have a very hard time with the rating that NJ gave. Perhaps they are just EXTREMEMLY picky. It goes to show you can't please everyone. I would strongly recommed this resort to everyone.

We booked our tours through CancunVista (Martha) and had no problems there. We visited Chitchen Itza, it was a long day, but fun. The ATV Tour was well worth the $45.00. The bus was air-conditioned and had t.v.'s in them so we were able to watch movies. The X-Caret was fun, but very hot and humid. Our kids swam with the dolphins and really enjoyed it.

While the RIU has a lively, festive atmosphere, which we enjoyed; we were hoping for a good place to just relax and have a few margaritas by the pool. The RIU was pretty crowded during our stay(May 5-12). The beach and the pools were always packed with people. Also, there are optional, structured activities every hour on the hour (i.e., water aerobics, table tennis, volleyball, beach parties)....which is good if you like that kind of vacation.SUMMARY: Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the RIU!

We had a great time. I read everything on this website and it was all helpful. The best beach I have ever seen in Mexico. The palm trees and the turquoise waters and soft white sand (never hot!) - fabulous. Indulge in a massage, we both had one on an afternoon it rained suddenly, under a grass hut on the beach, it was the ultimate in relaxation. The Playacar is the smallest of the Riu resorts in Playa del Carmen. I think much better than the Palace, Yucatan or Tequila - they are bigger and less cozy - so much walking. The Playacar has a nice intimacy. Not many kids the week we were there, about 50% Europeans, and yes - some topless. The staff is one of the best things as others mention. You can drink and eat practically non-stop, so who cares if the drinks are weak? Some of the evening entertainment is excellent and professional - some of it is comedy/lip syncing on stage with the animation team, hit or miss. It was VERY hot last week - didn't want to take any excursions - couldn't bear the thought of a bus trip to a hot place that might not have pina colada's available at a moment's notice! We did visit the town of Playa del Carmen twice, $5.00 by taxi, one afternoon to shop - typical touristy places, silver, pottery etc - had a cool cervesa at a bar on the beach. And then again one night - completely different vibe at night - should have gone more - all inclusive be damned! Ate at the Casa del Agua - great food, service and view of the street scene, Avenida 5, the pedestrian shopping street. Several bars with live music - it was fun. We also had drinks at a place called Alux - which is in the not so nice part of town - but is built entirely underground in a cave - stalagtites and mites - really cool too see without having to take an excursion. Here is a summary of the things every tells you to bring: -candles or glade plug ins for the rooms - although we really didn't need them in our third floor room. -underwater camera - we too tour guides try to charge you) -insulated glasses - brought them - but drank our drinks so fast didn't seem to be any point! -lots of one dollar bills - we tipped everyone a buck or two for the aforementioned great service. -SUNBLOCK. -long pants for the guys for dinner - not all do - but it looks nice - women tend to dress up a bit for dinner - cute sundresses, etc. -your own soap, shampoo and conditioner - they do have packets, but, you know. The rooms do have a powerful hair dryer. -walkman if you hate blaring disco music which they play at the pool and are trying to read. The two pools, one more quiet than the other, were nice, lots of chairs and choice of sun or shade. Overall I would highly recommenf the Playacar for the price. I would probably try something a notch above next vacation, in terms of restaurants and bedding. The beds were very hard and the sheets stiff and scratchy on tender sunburned skin. As fara as dining, I didn't mind the buffet's, I just hated the atmosphere in the main restuaurant - too brightly list and \"cafeteria-ish\". Ate at the steak house twice and the mood was much nicer there - I had chicken, and surf and turf - no it wasn't the best steak ever, but the other 4 courses were excellent. And the mood in an open-air restaurant by the ocean, with good service by far surpassed the main dining room. Too bad they didn't change the menu, or we would have been there every night.

The key is to crank up the ceiling fan. Also, the A/C struggled to keep up with the intense Mexican heat. I wouldn't be overly concerned, you won't be spending much time in your room anyways. The rooms are centrally located between the main lobby and restaurant and the pool and ocean. I don't think there is a bad location to be had.The week we stayed the Weather Channel had predicted rain or shower everyday. We were horrified by the forecast. I don't know how they determine forecasts, but we never saw a drop of rain. It did rain and night, sure sounded like a monsoon. We did however see plenty of sunshine. Whatever you do make sure you bring a decent lotion with a rating of at least 25SPF. They don't call it sun country for no reason.The food at the buffet was good. Don't expect gourmet quality food, but it is of good quality and should not disappoint. I especially enjoyed the breakfast, those donuts really did it for us. Also, they will make omlets to order. There are two other options a Mediteranean and Steak House themed experience. The Med is all seafood, so make sure you are aware of this before going. The steak house is good but again don't expect a Ruth Chris steak. Lunch is held down at the restaurant by the pool. It is convienient, but at times I would have preferred the air conditioned main rest. One nice option is that you will be able to eat breakfast or lunch at the Yucatan or the Tequila. We stayed at the Yucatan before and really liked the Hacienda. Check it out. I really didn't care for the Tequila.The grounds are immaculately kept. Palm trees, ferns, exotic vegetation are manicured daily. The staff does a fantastic job keeping thing organized and clean. I doubt you will find a nicer group or harder working group. The beach is fantastic. What is great about the Playacar is that you won't have to e annoying how people tend to reserve seats by the pool and beach by throwing down their worldly possessions, and not being around for hours at a time. Oh well, don't sweat it there's plenty of room. The beach is drop dead gorgeous.There are two pools. One pool has a bar and tends to attract the same people day and day out. The serious partiers. While the second pool is much quieter and reserved for those wanting to chill out and take a nap. The drinks are plentiful and the bartenders do a great job.The entertainment borders on excellent. The Michael Jackson show was very impressive. Also, the RIU dancers (I call them the Fly Girls and Boys) are great too. To somewhat cheesy, drinking contests, bad skits, etc. Don't be discouraged the staff goes out of their way to accomodate. Remember that the staff don't make a ton of money so it really is nice to tip the maid and the bartender. We brought a stack of $1 bills. I doubt it will effect the level of service you receive, but it sure made us feel better.All in all I am giving the Playacar 5 stars. Realistically it really deserves 4 stars, since there are better resorts out there that will pamper you stuff you with better quality food and drink. However, for the money the Playacar is a best buy, we payed $1700 USD. Be assured that if you have booked a trip you will have a great time and you won't be disappointed.

Our family's first all-inclusive vacation and we found it to be absolutely outstanding. The staff was exceptional and went out of their way to help us at any time. The rooms were great and the musty smell was only apparent if you didn't run the AC or fan. Each adjoining room shares a common door into the hallway but seperate room doors. It was very nice for our daughters to have their own room. The cleaning each day was very good and the girls enjoyed the towel 'animals' left each morning on the made beds. We left a $1.00 each day for the room service as they really did a nice job cleaning. The food was great, and yes, you do reserve your seating at the El Porche' Buffet on your arrival. We found that the later 8:30 seating was more to our liking since the evening entertainment didn't start until nearly 10:00 each night. We ate at the Turquesa (Steak House) one night and found it ok. Was nice to sit outside. We had no problem eating at El Porche' the other nights since there was plenty of food to choose from. The beach is wonderful with a swim area, windsurfers, and Hobie Cats to sail. If you know how to sail, just tell them and forego the $35 lesson. Be sure to reserve a boat early for the next day because they go quick. There are plenty of beach/poolside activities to keep one busy : pickup volleyball, mini soccer, dancing, water polo, and many activities for young kids. There is no snorkling at the Resort but we were recommended a small lagoon called Yalku near the small town of Akumal a few miles south. It was only $6.00 compared to the astronomical prices of Xcaret and Xel-Ha and was quiet and calm. We took the Resorts snorkling trip for more money and it was good but the surf was high due to a windy day. Playa del Carmen is just a 20 min. walk away where you can enjoy night life and barter from the small shops.The night entertainment was great fun and the resort entertainment staff was absolutely tireless.Overall, if your loo Palace two doors down.

I had never been to mexico before, and was somewhat leery. I shouldn't have been. Everything was incredible.Our trip started with us caravaning up to Midway Airport in Chicago, about 3 hours away. We arrived with no problems, and got in the baggage check in line for Funjet vacations. The line was long, but went very quickly. I felt very bad for people next to us though, as they had forgotten their birth certificates and were not allowed on the plane. What a bummer.Boarded the plane and we were off. Nice smooth flight to Cancun. No food served besides chex mix and cookies, but only a 3 hour flight so no big deal.Landed in Cancun and got through customs very quickly. No problems at all. Was met at Airport doors by very nice luggage porter. He waited til all my group was together, then took us over to our ride to the Riu Playacar. It was a very nice air conditioned bus. Coronas were available for $2.00 each. It took approximately 45 minutes to get to the resort, but time flew by due in no small part to the chatter of our Funjet guide. Great guy.Got to resort and checked in smoothly. Just remember there is a $20.00 deposit for a 2nd room key. My room was 3316. That room is in the blue building, 3rd floor, and you can see the ocean from the balcony, which is not possible in most room. There was no musty smell in my room at all, even though I was expecting it and had brought candles just in case. One of the other rooms had a very brief odor, but it disappeared immediately. My room had a great ocean breeze, but the room across the hall, 3308, had no breeze and the only view was of the back of a neighboring resort. I guess I got really lucky.This was the cleanest place I have ever stayed. The staff works extremely hard to keep everthing immaculate, and yet everyone always has a smile on their face.The floor shows were terrific. Be sure to try and catch them when think it was the best I've ever had, I had no problem finding something I liked. We went to the seafood restaurant one evening. While the adults seemed to enjoy it, the teens did not. It was a little more diverse than most American teens are used to eating. I would not recommend it to anyone not willing to experiment. Never tried the Steak restaurant. Being from the Midwest, I can't imagine any place on Earth having steaks as good as we have here, so I don't even try them when in different places.A cab ride to Playa de Carmen in only $4.00 and takes only a couple of minutes. No big deal. Shopping is fun, and people watching even funner. Ate at a great restaurant on the ocean. Best food I had in Mexico.Funjet representatives were very helpful, and I couldn't be happier with them. I will definitely take another funjet tour, and I will definitely stay at a RIU resort.Was a nasty odor in the discos at RIU Tequila and RIU Yucatan, so I left. No big deal.

I have to wonder about the few people who have written bad review for this place - they must be extremely picky - the kind of people who are never happy with anything. That said, I have very few complaints. Anyone who has done any research knows that the rooms supposedly have a musty smell - they do. If you came to have a good time you won't be in your room much anyway. Once you are in there a while you forget about it. The only other bad thing, is that they try to get you to sit the same place every night and at the same time - we never did. Although I think the head waiter was annoyed with us - but they never made us move. Also, the brochures say men are supposed to wear pants to dinner - most men I saw had shorts on - they may have changed that rule. The food was good - something for everyone. I personally could have lived on fresh salsa (excellent) and fresh fruit alone. It was not the \"exact\" same every night as some people have commented - the salad bar was the only thing that was mostly the same. There were always different entrees, fish, meats, etc. I'm not much of a meat eater, so I can't comment on the toughness of the beef or pork. I had some chicken in a tortilla and it was good. My friends liked the fish. Beverages - lots of fresh fruit juices in the morning (mimosa's once). One kind of beer - Corona. Most any kind of mixed drink. We especially liked the pool bar. I walked a good way toward town along the beach and I think the RIU Playacar has the best beach. It has a nice stand of palm trees to provide shade if you like and alot of beach chairs.

This allows the musty smell to build up and as the old saying goes \"first impressions are lasting\". O.K. having said that, the smell does disipate and was hardly noticable the next morning. The only other problem was that the showers are very slippery (speaking from experience with the floor) A shower mat can be obtained if reqested. I wish we had!!

We were treated kindly by all the workers. Our room were clean. The shower got hot and had plenty of pressure. It drained perfectly.

One thing noted is that only one plug in for the bathroom. I wish had brought an extension bar. I use a couple hair appliances. The bar of soap is tiny. I am glad brought one from home. thank goodness for reviews... The insulated mug also was a great idea..... you just ask for a fill up at the bar and they happily oblige you.

It is not going to be gourmet. One evening they had the biggest shrimp .They constantly there making dishes and bringing dishes in from the kitchen. I had the best fish and grilled vegetables one evening. I had to go back for seconds. Our waiter was so good. Dinner is assigned a time and table. You can be there anytime between 6:30 to 8:00 and then the next sitting is at 8:30. It is an opportunity to meet new people. We enjoyed it. I was addicted to the salsa they served. I miss it. There are always soups, pasta dishes, vegetarian dishes. We never went hungry. I also like how they had the beer and soda on tap and from mid morning until dark the restaurante on the beach was open and you could go in and just help yourself or get something from one of the bars . They had popcorn...nachos...and soft serve ice cream in cones all afternoon long. We chose the playacar because it is small. We did not want to dress up. Just went to relax and visits the sites.

The rooms do have a musty smell, but like everyone else on here we brought some air freshners and that solved the problem. I'm not sure if the mustiness comes from being close to the beach (we stayed in Hawaii within feet of the beach on our last vacation and we had no musty smell there). I think the smell comes from the tap water, which isn't drinkable. They must wash the towels in the same water because new towels we got came with the same musty smell. The rooms are well cleaned everyday and you get 4 bottles of hard liquor and 4 bottles of beer in your room, the beer is refreshed every 2 days. The food in the restaurant was good and the seating is assigned, men also have to wear pants to dinner. The food does tend to get a bit repititive after a few days and the other RIU resorts serve almost identical food so going to the other hotels to eat isn't a big change. The Riu Playacar seemed to be the most popular of the Riu resorts as everyone from the Yucatan and the Tequila seemed to be at our resort for the beach and the pool bar. The pool bar was rocking all the time... the animation team was everywhere and they made sure you had a good time. The beach was very nice and clean and as others have said... expect to see topless sunbathers. The resort was filled with mostly Canadian and European tourists... with a small portion of loud obnoxious americans. We personally saw the mexican staff, who were normally very attentive and friendly, instantly cool when a yank would show up.. so I can see how some american reviewers have a different perspective than the others that are writing here. The animation team seemed to be everywhere and they would sit at your table at dinner and draw you into friendly conversation. At the 6:30 and 8:30 seating times for dinner they formed a receiving line to the restaurant which made all the guests feel ext La Cumbia lounge.. which had a full size stage and sound system. One nice handy tip is that there is a market across the street from the the Playacar and it had everything from all kinds of souveniers, shops, internet cafe etc. The prices at this market were the same if not CHEAPER than the same stuff on 5th ave in PlayaDelCarmen. We visited PlayaDelCarmen a few times and it was definitely worth the trip... the taxi fare from the Playacar area to PDC is SET at 40 pesos with no need to tip the driver. I would highly recommend this resort if you are visiting PDC as it seemed to be the most popular one in the whole Playacar area.", "Date": "March 2, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "CANADA", "Title": "\u201cHere's the plan\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR861697", "Content": "A group of 4 of us went there last week.

When the a/c was on and the door closed, any musty smell was soon eliminated. The daily buffet was exceptional, and you could always find something that met your satisfaction. However, the food at the two retaurants that required reservations was much to be desired. Ironically, the daily buffet REQUIRED men to wear long pants at the buffet, but you could wear shorts at the two restaurants that served the below par food and where is was not easy to get a reservation.If you prefer to hang-out on the beach, there is no bar there. You must walk-up to the pool area or the open-air restaurant that serves the buffet lunch. There is no bar in the hotel lobby, or the restaurant that serves the daily buffet dinner, however beer and wine are available at the buffet. The entertainment staff was great...and entertaining. Some nights included professional entertainment that was outstanding, and a Michael Jackson impersonator preformance was exceptional. The entire hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating, including the Mexicans that we encountered during our out-of-hotel excursions.Sorry Riu Playacar, I never go back to the same hotel, but I would consider another Riu hotel in the future.", "Date": "February 22, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Idaho Falls, Idaho", "Title": "\u201cI'd Go Again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR858771", "Content": "We prepared for the worst, but boy, did we waste our time.

Let me start out with the positive. We stayed at the RIU Playacar and We thought it was beautiful, particularly the grounds, the pools and the beach. In addition the staff was extremely friendly, attentive and professional. Given the amount of people and the different tastes and nationalities, We thought the food that was served in the main dining room was very good. There were many, many choices and if someone could not find something to like, shame on them. We were given the choice of making reservations to eat at two other places. The food in these two other rooms unfortunately left a lot to be desired. One night we make reservations for the room called the Steak House. One of the entrees, Sirloin Steak was very tough. I think since the name of the place was the Steak House, a better choice of steak such as Filet Mignon should have been a choice. There was one entr\u00e9e that did include Filet Mignon with shrimp, but those that had it only got about 5 pieces of Filet Mignon and 5 pieces of Shrimp. We never went to the other Restaurant choice which was called the Mediterranean restaurant. The reason was that we asked several people on different nights what they thought about the food and we always received negative comments. Our room was a nice size and was clean. It came with a porch. However we found the odor not only in the room, but in the whole building to be unacceptable. It was moldy and musty. The hotel asked if we would consider using our towels more than one day for environmental reasons. we would have been more than happy to do that, but the towels never dried! In fact, the clothes in the drawers always seemed to be not quite dry. In addition, there was no iron or ironing board nor a bathtub. We also had very little drawer space. The entertainment also left little to be desired. It was sub par and not the least bit professional. Our idea of entertainment is not playing bingo as an example or being entertained by young people in training for the travel industry.Suggestions: It would be nice to know what the other Rius were having for dinner and for entertainment and be able to go there. We were told we could only go there for breakfast and lunch.Also we were told that there was a gym or workout area. That was in another Riu and the equipment was very limited. When I was in there, there were 2 other people and it was crowded. I had to wait to use the equipment I wanted. There were 9 people in my party.

There was definitely good points and bad points to the trip. Some things couldn't be helped (like the weather!) but other things I think could be corrected - and I do intend on corresponding with the RIU to let them know about it. I agree with some of the reviews. First of all, YES, the room did have a damp/musty smell. I guess that since I read about this before I arrived, I was expecting it. It wasn't pleasant, but it wasn't too bad either. I guess if I were to go there again, I'd bring along a scented candle or air freshener. Also, the room did feel \"damp\" so our clothes felt damp before we put them on. Perhaps they need to invest in dehumidifiers! Other than that, the room was fine. There wasn't a tub, but I never take baths anyhow, so that was fine. They always have about 3-4 big bottles of purified water in your refrigerator in addition to Pepsi, Pepsi light (not Diet Pepsi, more like \"Tab\") carbonated water and Corona. They also have 4 bottles of alcohol - the labels are in Spanish, so I'm not sure what they all were. That wasn't really necessary since you could go to the bar and get a drink most of the time! One other complaint that I do intend on reporting back to RIU about is that we NEVER got all of our towels back. If you want to reuse the same towels, you just hang them up. If you want fresh towels, put them in the shower. We started off with 2 bath towels, 2 hand towels, 2 washcloths and a bath mat. We only ended up with a bath mat 2 out of 7 days we were there. Some days we'd only get 1 hand towel and other days we'd get no hand towels and 1 washcloth. One day we did tell our rep that we didn't get any towels. Perhaps the maids didn't want us to be so wasteful, but since nothing seemed to dry in the room, we did want fresh towels just so they could be dry. Perhaps the maids wanted a bigger tip! The next good/bad thing was the food. Breakfast to me was great. I loved getting made to order omelettes or eggs over easy. They also had pancakes, french toast and a variety of breads, fruits, etc. Lunches took place down near the pool. For some reason, I just couldn't really get into the food for lunch. They always had hot dogs (kind of cold) and hamburgers (more like meatloaf than a burger) and nachos with a variety of toppings. Also available was soft serve ice cream. Dinner time was my big complaint. I have to agree with the reviewers who didn't care for the food - especially anything with beef. It was tough as shoe leather! Fortunately, there was enough food to find something to eat. The one big complaint that we had was about the \"Steak\" restaurant. We tried a few times to get in. It was always booked. One day we set the alarm to make early reservations, and the head waiter was no where to be found. He claimed later that he was there, so the fact that he was not telling the truth was very annoying. My husband decided to take a walk to where they served the steak and I believe that they had about 12 tables total set up - that's out of probably 50 tables available in that area. We never did get into that restaurant, but since the beef was so poor in the buffet, perhaps it was in our best interest not to get in! Also, the other reviewers are correct in the fact that you are assigned a table for dinner. That could be good or bad depending on who you are sitting near. Fortunately for us, we ended up sitting with a very nice couple and by our last day, we ended up attending the evening entertainment with them. The rest of the vacation was wonderful. The grounds were beautiful! The pool looked inviting, but since it was a little breezy out, after sticking our feet in the water one day, we decided that the ocean was warmer. They had an entertainment staff that almost seemed like \"camp counsellors\" who would try to engage you if you wanted to learn a line dance or play games such as bingo, table tennis, etc. They didn't pressure you to do anything you didn't want to. The beach was gorgeous! Yes, there were several \"vendors\" coming around trying to sell you silver items, beads, trinkets, etc, but if you said you were'nt interested, they left you alone. Also, be aware that there are several topless bathers. It didn't really bother me, but I guess it could be embarrasing if you brough along your sons and if they'd stop and point!!! The evening entertainment was nice. The shows rotate among the various RIU resorts, so you get a different show every night. Some were better than others, but all in all, it was nice. The entertainment staff did a wonderful job to get you into the mood of the show and the announcer was amazing! I think he spoke at least 4 different languages. It's too bad he had to talk so fast to get everything out! We booked our trip through Funjet. Everything went so smoothly thanks to them. We were told by our travel agent to look for the \"Lomas\" people with the white pants and ties and bright blue shirts. They got us to transportation at the airport, booked any side trips, arranged for our pick up back to the airport and made sure we were at the correct location at the airport. That brings me to one last point about the trip. You do need to be careful for people who try to book tours for you down there. We were told that there are a lot of people who try to sign you up for \"time shares\" and try to entice you with free trips to Xcaret, Tulum, etc. When we encountered these people, we told them that we're all set for the week, or that we're leaving tomorrow. The people are very friendly and try to engage you into conversation by looking at a tee shirt or baseball cap you're wearing, or if they notice your wrist bracelet from the hotel. It's best to just smile and keep walking and tell them you're all set or else you'll be taking up a lot of your precious time. I know this review is rather wordy, but this is the information I would have liked to have before I arrived. I think perhaps for several hundred dollars more, I'd think about upgrading to the RIU Palace. I heard from a couple who ended up staying there that the food was 3 times as good and everything was top notch.", "Date": "January 19, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cThe Perfect Exciting Vacation Ever\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR836947", "Content": "This hotel is terrific!

At first we thought we made a mistake after seeing only couples and seniors, but after the first night we became aquainted with the staff and met other guests that were in our age group. The resort itself is beautiful and the views are breathtaking. They would go out of their way to make sure that we were happy. We did requested a different room in the beginning since it was on the first floor and had a musky smell. They arranged another room by the next day on the third floor. In the new room they had a basket of friuts waiting with a note hoping that this room was to our liking and it made a big difference with better views and no musky smell. The staff was extremely friendly and always helpful like bartenders Carlos and Roberto whom service was impecable. Also, the entertainment staff was extremely energetic and alway got the crowd into the shows and events. Entertainment staff such as Juan and Antonio was the best and have to definitely say \"thanks guys for a great time\". There's three other Rui's resorts all in walking distance that you have access to each one has it's own characteristics and charm. The food was great and I don't understand why some would write and complain. Don't expect fast food here, all is fresh and you can tell that they do very much so caters to the Europeans which is a nice change than from some other resorts. I did last year went on a Carnival cruise and found the food to be aweful and at best just OK. As for the nightlife in the resort there is one club in the Tequila resort opens every night and the other club in the Yucatan resort opens from Thursday nights to Sunday. My friend and I went to both on the same night and found them to be OK, great for couples and others who are content with sticking with the resort's guests. It's nice and convienent that you don't have to pay to get in and all your drinks are included, but we did go into town for the nightlife and after that we became regulars. Each night we would go to bars and clubs in town such as the Blue Parott, Captain Tutix and next door to Kuba. All of these clubs are located on the beach and we met more people that were in our age group and each night was a blast. The drinks were affordable, there's no cover charge and a cab ride is approxiately 4 US dollars each way. We were disappointed with our tour operator that was at the resort that sold us our excursions. We did managed to go on two different ones and had a great time on both, but realized after just across the street from the resort at the shopping plaza where the Tourist Information, we could have gone on these excursions for almost half of the price than we paid for. So my advise to anyone that is planning on going on some excursions, shop around first and you can save a whole lot of money. Also, remember to bargain with the locals for any goods or sovenirs. Anyone that does not mind to do a little physical activity should definitely check out the Mayan Ruins. Very unique and interesting. Overall, my friend and I really, really enjoyed ourselves. I have been to many differents resorts and I have to say that this is one of the best that I've ever been to.

I did overhear some people saying that their rooms were a little musty and that they had requested new rooms. Our room did have a very light odor, but it was not enough for us to request a new room. Breakfast is by far the best meal of the day, made to order omelets, eggs (any style), bacon, sausage, toast, tons of different kinds of breads, fresh fruit, yogurt, fresh squeezed furit juices, etc....The buffet offered quite a variety and we were never disappointed. If you come to this resort and can't find a thing to eat, you must be really picky!! The drinks were good, we are not big drinkers but what we did try was tasty. The grounds at this resort are kept so clean. We never had a problem with cleanliness. We tipped the maid $2-3 U.S. dollars a day. She took really good care of us during our stay.

We walked along the beach and even walked all the way down to the Porto Real Hotel (very nice). We had dinner one night at La Parrilla Restaurant. Very, very good food. All in all we had a wonderful time and we truly do plan to return to the Riu Play ng to have a good, relaxing vacation. I'm sure I left out several things, but if I can answer any questions, please e-mail me.", "Date": "November 27, 2002"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toms River,NJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat Time\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR753538", "Content": "Spent a week Nov 2-9 at Rui Playacar. Found the staff very friendly,always wanting to please. This place was spotless and the housekeeping staff was constantly sweeping/ cleaning the public areas. Food & drinks abundant with a good variety. I didn't find the drinks watered down , in fact the bartenders asked if we wanted a single or double. We were fortunate to have only 1 day of rain and the resort provides umbellas for each room. The beach is truly beautiful and clean. Lots of lounge chairs. We had no towel problems on the beach or in our room. The room had a musty basement smell that I got used to quickly. We had no trouble getting reservations at steak house or seafood house. We did not sit at the same table for breakfast but were at the same one at the dinner buffet. There was plenty for us to do at the resort but we chose to relax at the pool or beach. I did end up getting intestinal upset around day 4.

Drinks were not strong, but then I preferred this. For a strong drink try the ones on the menu that are advertised as long drinks. Liquor in the rooms is awful (what is that stuff???!!!) Bring alot of single bills (American) for tipping. We had problems getting any and none one seemed to have any, or didn't want to give out any. Alot of Europeans which gave the hotel an international flair. Loved that. Go to COBA. JORGE is a wonderful, informative guide. Friendly staff worked very hard, be sure to tip.

The hotel itself is nice enough and clean (not as nice as others in the area we have stayed at ie Iberostar Quetzal/Tucan). What we hated... we had to sit at the same table at the same time for dinner each night at the buffet and the same table for breakfast. So no matter who you met or how your day went there we were at table 118 by ourselves. The buffet was THE EXACT SAME each night. At least they could shuffle it around a bit to make it look different. By the 3rd day we were all referring to this as \"Ground Hog Day\". The a la carte restaurant was so so. We were also under the impression we could dine at all 3 Riu's. Not the case - you can drink and play at all 3 (not the Palace though - the nicest Riu) but you cannot eat anywhere except your assigned table at your assigned time. I will never book another Riu and I will refuse to be assigned a table and time at any resort I pay this much to visit in the future. I find these reviews very helpful and will be travelling to Mexico in January for the 10th time.

The resort was beautiful-extremely clean and the service was wonderful. Two pools, one with a swim up bar, and the other on the quiet side for relaxing and reading. You could be as active or relaxed as you choose. The beach was spectacular, white sand and turquise waters. We ate at the steak specialty resturant once and it was ok but not worth signing up at 7am. I thought the buffet was better.The menus changed daily and they had to cover a lot of diffrent cultures and the food was very very good. There are two bars and the drinks were served very quickly (try a half-moon) We ate breakfast at both the Rui Yucatan and Tequila and thought the Playacar was the nicest of the three. There was not one bad thing I could complain about, and the price was unbelieveable at $650- Also try the one hour body massage for $28(you think you are in heaven).

Staff is more than accomadating! Refill minibar every other day but tim them a buck and leave a note and you will have what you ask for. Most people at the resort are European so if you object to topless sunbathing, better find some place else to go. Men do have to wear pants to dinner but they can be jeans. Mostly couples average age of 30's at the resort. No singles or spring break atmosphere! Entertainment is ok. About the same as a criuse ship. Good some nights and cheesy others!

The entertainment staff was lacking during the 4.5 days of rain there wasn't a thing todo. The showers clogged up if you used to much water pressure and the water pressure would change depending on what other people in the hotel were doing. The rooms SMELLED and I can't stress enough that they SMELLED. If you go bring an air freshner. The rooms were very damp. Every night when it was time to go to bed the bed sheets were damp and they also smelled. You couldn't hang anything to dry because it wouldn't not even if you put it outside. The cleaning staff had a hard time understanding that if you take towels replace them with new ones and when the sun final can out they ran out of towels at the pool everyday. So hang onto your towel. The beach was small but nice. Watch out for the mexicans they are constantly bugging you to by something and other resorts would come up to you and try and get you to go to there resort. I have stayed at other RIU resorts before and wouldn't recommend this one.

Room was clean, air conditioning worked fine. 5. Grounds were beautiful beach was really nice. Plenty of lounge chairs, nice pools. Bad Points. 1. Had a hard communicating with the maid that we needed more than one bath towel for two people and we needed a bath mat. 2. Specialty seaafood restaurant good, service slow. 3. Liquor provided in room was pretty poor. 4. Shower would back up a little, never overflowed. Toilet stopped up once, fixed promptly. Room was slighty musty but was fine when you turned on the air. 5. Entertainment was so-so. Emcee introduced everything in 4 different languages, got wearing after a little while. 6. If you go during hurricane season like we did, be sure to bring cards, lots of books, or a gameboy.

We were stuck in the terrible hurricane and only had one full day of sun, but still enjoyed our vacation. The hotel staff is very friendly, they will help you and answer any questions you may have. The rooms are clean and don't really smell as bad as people tend to say. A good suggestion is to bring air freshner with you and spray it every 2 or 3 days to keep your room smelling nice and fresh. The food was very nice, we had buffey every single day, since people say that the sea food and the steak house are not that great. Every day they make something different and there is a lot to choose from . ( Trust me I am a picky eater but I actually thought that the food was very nice ) The beach is absolutely beautiful, eventhough we only got to enjoy it for one day. It's huge and very clean. I am a beach person and I would honestly rate this beach as a 10 out of 10. The pool itself is also very nice, however I didn't even get a chance to swim in it. After 1 pm until 9 pm there isn't really that much to do, so if the weather isn't great.. REMEMBER TO BRING CARDS WITH YOU!!. The nightly entertainment is good, it starts at 9 and finishes at 11 pm. To rate this hotel out of 10 I would give it an 8 just because none of the rooms face the ocean or the pool, so unless you enjoy the garden view you shouldn't have any reason not to give this hotel a 10. For anyone who has any questions, I would be happy to answer them.
