When we first visited Istanbul we stayed at the Erbil Hotel next door to the Metropol and were rather disappointed with that choice, so we were a bit wary of what the Metropol would provide on our return to the city. I can say though that we were pleasantly surprised. The staff were pleasant, the nights were quiet (even with the local nightlife... we had a street-facing room and it was fine), the rooms were very clean and comfortable and the pillows were of decent quality. The only thing to worry about is the disturbing colour of pink that the rooms are decorated in... but that can be easily overlooked given the other virtues of the hotel.

He showed us the room and gave us a great deal for 4 nights. He was also exceptionally helpful with advice about the best things to see in Istanbul (as well as what to avoid). As we had arrived in the morning- he gave us a free breakfast and it was great to be able to check in straight away. Istanbul was a fantastic city to see and staying at this hotel made it even more of a pleasure. It is near all the best sights, the rooms are very comfortable and clean and the staff were excellent.

The hotel does not have a restaurant, but there are several very popular ones within 100 meters. We usually ate in some other areas of the city, but mostly due to our schedule and some specific recommendations that we had for places to eat.
