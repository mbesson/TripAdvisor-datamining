This was bad considering we just got off an international flight to Madrid and just wanted to rest, not go out into the city. We were offered nothing for this wait to get the room, not even a bottle of water at the bar! Our room was facing the street and was kinda loud at night. The worst thing was that we did not discover there was free WiFi until the last day of our stay. They offer internet access for 9Euro / day in room and we thought that included WiFi but it did not. So ask for a WiFi code at the front desk if you do stay there. Room was clean and very modern. Beds are really hard!

Our first room was directly next to the elevator door. We weren't too keen on having that room so we immediately asked to swap rooms. The lady was not friendly and she made it seem like I had done something wrong. The next room was very warm until we realised late at night that the heater in the bathroom was on and couldn't be turned off! After calling the reception, they sent an employee to look at it, however he couldn't speak English! They called me later saying they turned the heater off for the whole hotel which we found out wasn't true. The next morning after an uncomfortable night's sleep we complained to the reception again and, again no one could speak English until the manager came. I'll say he was quite helpful and apologetic and gave us another new room (3rd one) which was one of the street front ones. The hotel is quite modern but I can tell it has been renovated on the surface and they have added such as things as new lights, bedding, tiles, etc. The location is quite good. It would be better if they had more English speaking staff and the staff took guests concerns more seriously and not as if they are annoying.", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laramie, Wyoming", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel & location, rooms seem to involve a tradeoff\u201d", "Author": "JerkyLlama", "ReviewID": "UR130600039", "Content": "I was put up at the Vincci Centrum for a short conference in Madrid and overall had a relatively enjoyable experience but one that left me with mixed emotions. The hotel is in a nice location, just a short walk from Puerta del Sol, Santa Ana square, the Prado Museum area, and Retiro Park. The staff was very nice and welcoming, doing such things as making dinner reservations at a nice place nearby and being very polite and helpful during the tasty breakfast buffet. In talking to other guests who attended my conference and stayed at this hotel, the rooms seemed to entail a bit of a tradeoff. There appear to be some rooms such as mine which feel quite spacious and have nice natural light, but are facing the busy street and are honestly quite noisy with street noise. I had an important presentation one morning and was up half the night before due to the noise from traffic, horns and sirens, and the jarring click-clack of cars frequently running over what must be a loose manhole cover. I'm usually a deep sleeper, but falling asleep took so long that at 1:30am I was *this* close to going down to the lobby to try to get a quieter room to get some rest before my important 9am presentation (for which I faced the double whammy of being jetlagged for anyway). In talking with other guests, it seems that the rooms off the street are much quieter, but feel smaller and darker. So depending on your preferences, be aware of this fact. Also, in my own experience and in talking to other guests, the in-room internet connection was a bit erratic at best. Overall, a nice place ... I just wish the windows were more soundproof and the internet connection more consistent given the price (about 140 euros a night in late May ... not ridiculous, but also not cheap either). The room itself, service, and the location would merit 4~4.5 stars ... but the poor sleep quality make me rate my experience at 3 stars and would have me looking for another location to stay the next time I return to this lovely city.", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, decent rooms, very clean.\u201d", "Author": "Tom P", "ReviewID": "UR130566066", "Content": "Stayed here mainly due to its location, it's close to the main areas we wanted to visit (museums, Sol square, restaurants etc).

Upon first arrival it was difficult to see the hotel entrance as the building to the left is dwarfed in scaffolding which, judging by the graffiti/posters and pigeon excrement covering the side walk, is an old demolition site gone bust. Not the hotels fault, however the path should be kept clean for health reasons let alone guest perception. Upon entering the building, everything was very dark, the wood paneling, the lighting and floors. As we stood puzzled trying to ascertain where the reception was, we where overcome by the stench of raw sewage. The female front desk clerk gave no welcome other than \"an unfriendly\" do you need a room. We both speak Spanish, but continued the conversation in English, \"actually we have a booking\". NB> upon last minute research with Trip Advisor, I had sent 3 forms of communication. An email to booking.com, whom clarified the information, another to the hotel reception and also telephoned the hotel to make sure we had a quiet room away from the elevator and a view as my partner suffers badly from claustrophobia. With no mention of the sewage smell I had to ask and she abruptly snipped it wasn't the hotels fault it was the area and it was being dealt with. We entered the room and sure enough, a small, stale smelling room, window looking out onto a brick wall and 3m away from elevator, opposite the cleaning closet. Hastily back at reception, I pointed out we had been given everything I had specifically NOT asked for. She said, its all we have and insisted the room was not close to the elevator. I said its 3m away I measured it, she argued it wasn't! She continued to reprimand me, that they do not read the guest requests when I had asked why we were not informed my requests couldn't be met. I was so disturbed by her insolence and Yes, from the moment we stepped into this property we wanted to leave. We were now given a smoking room, both being non smokers, on the first floor directly above the entrance and views to the scaffolding. The smoke stained off white curtain had an old dark coffee stain that had been there some time and throughout the room and hotel the dark cheap wood paneling was chipped and scratched with no signs of repair and black scuff marks on the white wall areas. I had read in previous reviews that the hotel was on a quiet street and that there were no TV channels in English. They do have 6 channels in English, however only one works - CNN Africa and again I was told by the same unfriendly receptionist it was being fixed. Judging by the jammed news report on each channel, this issue was obsolete. The sewage smell and the English TV channels typically remained unaltered after our 3 day visit. Regarding the street, which has daily tour buses driving down every hour was not my interpretation of quiet. The first morning I was abruptly awoken at 8am by the overnight desk clerk and a maintenance worker gossiping VERY loudly directly below our window. I asked them to please speak quieter and away from the hotel entrance. He glanced at his watch as if I was inconveniencing him, muttered something at me as the desk clerk moved him off to the side to finish smoking. Downstairs in the over priced breakfast area, every day were 10 newspapers. All Spanish, not one for any of the foreign guests. Early Sunday morning we left the hotel for breakfast, noticing someone had vomited against the main entrance wall and across the path. Upon returning late afternoon the vomit was still there and we immediately mentioned this to the same unfriendly female clerk. How many hotel staff had walked over this disgusting site to come into work that day? This hotel clearly is not 4 stars, with its thread-bare carpets; the permanent mat in the foyer entrance is so worn, its edges are dog-eared and its only a matter of time before an accident occurs. Every night as we entered the hotel, we passed through a cloud of smoke from the same front desk clerk smoking outside, below our window, the entrance littered with cigarette butts and not so much as a welcoming nod from him. The elevator is tiny for a hotel of this size and requires a great degree of patience in waiting for it to arrive, with mechanical failure to close the doors once we had max of 4 people inside. Now I'm quite sure Mr. Marcelo [--], the Hotel Manager will write to rationalize and maybe camouflage most of this review as chronicled with many other complaints, but I can only encourage he pay careful attention to my honest and objective review, in the hopes of making it more hospitable to foreigners who have traveled far and at great cost to stay. I will also forward on this review to the CEO of the hotel chain.

Over the duration of 2 weeks my room was moved three times as a result of multiple issues at this property. My first several days at this hotel, ended with me in the accident and emergency department getting stitches. Due to a broken tile and missing threshold, my foot was lacerated bad enough to require stitches. On my way to the hospital I stopped by the front desk and advised them what had happened. Four hours later when I returned to the hotel after being treated in the ED, I found the room exactly as I left it. The blood, the missing wood, nothing had been touched. I went back to the desk to complain and was told that the maintenance supervisor was on vacation, and the manager would call me the next day!!!! The next day, after not receiving a call from the manager, and now without air conditioning I had to return to the front desk to complain again. I was moved to another room that night. Never did anyone apologize for my injury or try to take responsibility. Once in the room, on my very first night, I had discovered bugs in the room. I called the front desk and they said they would sent the housekeeper to the room to spray pestisides. I advised that I was NOT going to breath pestisides and they ask me to tell them when I was leaving and they would spray the room. I was horrified at their response, and went to the desk in person. The very rude staff advised me that Madrid was a very old city, and sometimes the outside bugs come in. After being disrespected with very bad broke English, I returned to my room. The following day the manager, I believe his name was Michael called me in my room. He asked me \"What do I need\", as if I was somehow responsible for all of the issues within the hotel. Following our conversation, he again moved me to another. There was no apology, no offer of a free drink, or any attempt to make my horrific stay better. The third and final room I was moved to was AGAIN, without functioning AC. It was the worst work trip I can imagine. I agree with the earlier post, the staff was certainly not very nice if you dont speak Spanish. I have seen many positive post about this hotel, so I was excited to stay here. It is clear to me now that many of those post are clear fabrications!

The hotel is very nice indeed and looked very clean with beautiful design and very clean rooms. Very often in Spanish hotels breakfast is a disappointment.

Also the staff was very professional, helpful and friendly. BUT...Make sure you ask for a quiet room if you want a good night sleep. I was given a room on the first floor, street-side. Traffic outside is dense and noisy and the room was not well noise-insulated. Traffic will keep you awake or make you wake up early! Also the airco in my room was not (yet?) working. The weather was nice and sunny with outside temperatures rising to 25C in the shade in early april. When I got in bed, I estimate the temperature in my room was around 26C. I want 21C or less for a good night's sleep. The in room airco controller was set to cooling and full cold at high fan speed, but didn't blow cooled air. Either the airco was broke or the hotel hadn't switched on the central airco system yet. Frankly I expect airco to be available year round in (Spanish) hotels in this price class.

The oysters and the cod tapas are just amazing. Near there, you can find Botin, the oldest restaurant in the world (they serve a spectacular lech\u00f3n) and a street full of bars, where the Txacolina tapas place is great.

While the showers are great (as noted in other reviews) and the decor is chic, the hotel does not have adequate A/C in the rooms to make a trip to Madrid manageable in the summer. For travelers staying during other times of the year, this might not be a problem, but if you're stay is anytime between June and August, spend your money elsewhere so you can sleep at night! Details: After entering both rooms, I turned the AC up to full, but only a slow breeze of slightly cool air came out. In both rooms on the two separate occasions, both my wife and I woke up in the middle of the night sweating. I speak fluent Spanish and spoke with the reception after the first night, requesting that the AC in my room be fixed or I be given another room. They first said that there wasn't anything they could do, then said they would have the mechanic come by. That evening the mechanic still hadn't come by and they said they'd try to find another room for the second 2-nite stay later that week. While they did find another room, the AC was exactly the same and we had much difficulty sleeping. There are plenty of other hotels in Madrid in this price range--my advice to summer travelers would be to pass on the sleek furnishings and stay somewhere more mundane that has at least invested in a decent air conditioning system. Laptop Tip: If you are bringing a laptop, make sure to have your own internet cord.

We were asked to move 3 blocks away to a sister location, the Vincci Centrum, without so much as an apology. We were booked into the Vincci Centrum, into a smoking room, although we had reserved a non-smoking room with Vincci Soho. The next problem encountered was the lack of internet connectivity within our room. This was one of the selling points for the Vincci Soho as we both needed to do some work remotely while in Spain. The front desk seemed un-sympathetic with the situation. They grudgingly offered to let us log into the internet in another room they were saving in case a late night traveler arrived at their door step - it wasn't reserved. We told them that was inadequate - and had to demand they either fix our internet or give us a room with it. They grudgingly moved us into the room they were saving. The rooms are extremely cramped. The view was of a brick wall from our room, so make sure to be explicit in your reservations if a view is important for you. The rooms were very nicely appointed - looks like they were recently updated. However, there is an odd 1/3 shower door arrangement that makes it impossible to shower without getting water all over the bathroom. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel - mainly based on the poor service. My experience with hotels in this price range is if there is a problem, it is solved immediately with apologies, or the hotel does what they can to make up for the inconveniences through other complimentary services. We felt we had to cajole them into providing the basic services described on their website, which isn't much fun. We stayed at another Vincci hotel (Vincci La Rabida) in Seville.

Firstly the lobby area is tiny, everywhere in the hotel is so dark, lit constantly by harsh spotlights which just heat the place up. The reception staff have excellent english and are helpful to a degree (when i asked them to call a cab to the airport for me i was told to stand on street....nice!!). Also had problem with air-con and was told nobody could take a look at it till the following day. They also have very annoying habit of interrupting you mid-flow to answer the phone, leaving you just standing there waiting for them to return to you. We spent our first 2 nights in a room which had no natural light, a small window opened onto an internal fire escape which was always in darkness. The harsh spotlights made everything seem surreal in the middle of the day. Girlfriend went a bit stir crazy with the cabin fever. Again i'd agree with the rooms being too small and having too much furniture. Bathrooms are good though, great shower, 2 sinks, big mirror. Asked to be moved to exterior room after 1st night, but were told at 12.30 that we were too late. Eventually moved the next morning. New room was fine (no noise at all). If i hadn't had experience of 1st room i'd probably be agreeing with the hotel's 4 star rating but the interior rooms are a huge problem, avoid them. This hotel has no bar area just seating in the lobby. Overall no atmosphere.

The bellman did say that in one year, they would be doing construction on the building next door so that might be something to keep in mind. The one criticism was that we asked the front desk for a restaurant recommendation and the person helping us just rummaged and gave us a card for a restaurant over near Plaza Mayor. We took a stroll past the restaurant and it was closed on Sundays. Probably a very minor oversight on the hotel's part.

The rooms are fairly large and very clean, bathroom is well-equipped, and service is impeccable. Each room has a couch, small coffee table, ottoman, big closets, and desk; overall comfortably furnished. Room service food quality is superb and reasonably priced...to my surprise. A couple minor negatives about the hotel. First, the TV does not offer any English programming. Second, the wooden floors tend to make a lot of noise when you walk around with your shoes. This is noteworthy because when your hotel room neighbors walk back into their room at 4am, it is likely that the sound of their heels and boots walking all around the room will keep you up. Lastly, the hotel room door has a 3/4 inch gap on the bottom, and everytime someone smokes from the elevator lobby, it will get through to your room. Just use an extra towel to block it.

Perfectly adequate, but all seemed a little bit cramped.

Also, going in November you'd expect the weather to be cooler (which is was - averaging around 10-12oC), but the heating in the hotel was turned up full blast all of the time, which made for an uncomfortable nights sleep.
