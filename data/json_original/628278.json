And the best apartaments are the Nova apartaments! I went there in February while it was freezing outside and was delighted to the apartamnet. There was everything you could need:water and wine glasses,pots,kitchenwares, a washdisher,a stereo,coches,2 tv, many many other fab things and an extremely comfy bathroom! I loved so much laying in an hot water bath with -10\u00c2\u00b0 outsided! Having breakfast in the morning while the apartament was kissed by the sun was a pleasure. But I have to admit that the hardest thing was that we had to get up from the bed........it was the best and most comfortable bed I have never slept into! My back is still dreaming that mattress! And what to say about the awesome patio/balcony we had... Another magnificent thing was the daily cleaning. At night we found the apartament immaculate. These people are extremely kind. When I broked a wine glass the staff member wasn't \"angry\" but he was worried we had enough glasses! Moreover I called the reception on Saturday and they were so kind to reserve a car for me for the next morning at 5am to pick me up to the airport. I really enjoy my stay in A'dam thanks to my wonderful friend, the dutch kindness, the amizing city and the Nova apartaments!! Thank you very much from Italy and I hope to see you again in November!", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Heraklion, Greece", "Title": "\u201cDescent, clean apartments, good value for money\u201d", "Author": "zuiveld", "ReviewID": "UR118057035", "Content": "Near tram stop and a nice restaurant, nice room.

This is a totally self-serve apartment. There is no receptionist or anyone to greet you. The only staff are the care takers, who did a fantastic job and were very attentive. We arrived in Amsterdam much earlier then the 2 p.m. check-in, but still headed over to the Apartment as Kartel arranged an early check-in. There is a small red \"Nova Apartments\" sign outside the apartment entry. At the apartment entry (on the outside) you ring a bell for the receptionist on the intercom to the left of the door. The man greeted us via the intercom and advised us to leave our luggage inside the foyer area by the stairs and to return at 1 p.m., then buzzed us in. We returned at 1 p.m. and once again buzzed-in by the receptionist via the intercom to find our luggage still by the stairs in the foyer as we left it earlier. We were under the impression our luggage would have been delivered to our apartment or moved to a secure location from the earlier conversation with the receptionist as both of our business laptops were with our luggage. There also was another guest waiting with us. There was no envelope with our name or a key for our apartment, so the caretaker phoned the receptionist and the issue was resolved after Kartel & the other lady explained the situation. The caretaker showed us to our basement apartment # 72/1 & the other lady to her apartment, which he was still cleaning. There is a lift in the building, but the lift does NOT go to the basement apartments. There are some steep swirl steps you need to climb down CAREFULLY to reach apartment # 72/1 and I was concerned about injury down those steps with our luggage, but to our rescue the caretaker swiftly carried our luggage to our apartment. The apartment was very clean, well decorated, and airy for a basement apartment. There is a kitchenette, adequate luggage storage and everything you will need for your stay. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. The room is cleaned daily. The linens and towels also changed daily. Your room will be cleaned between 11 am-4 pm daily. These apartments are non-smoking; however, on our second day we smelled cigarette smoke in our room. Kartel and I are non-smokers never smoked a day in our lives so this was rather annoying, but because we were headed out for several hours we didn't make a big fuss as we didn't know were it was coming from. Kartel read other reviews about appliances not working & electrical issues. Well with his \"it can't happen to us mentality,\" late Sunday night a fuse went out when Kartel plugged the iron into outlet near the hob. We had no electricity in the bathroom and on the outlets over the kitchenette area from Sunday night until we left Monday morning. The location of the apartment is ideal and centrally located to everything. It's located a short 5 minute walk to the Museumplein tram stop. Tram #5 to Centraal Station will take you to all of the major sights. It's also a short walk to supermarkets, restaurants, the \"I amsterdam\" sign and the Van Gogh museum. Vondel Park was only a 15 - 20 walk, but the #5 tram can take you there as well. Kartel sent an email to the Receptionist on today advising of the electrical issues and the smell of cigarette smoke in our room. The receptionist didn't respond to the electrical issue only noted that they are a non-smoking facility and that the next guest complained about smoke in our apartment, as if we were the smokers. Overall, the apartment suited our needs: to sleep, shower, & store our belongings. The location can't be beat as it's centrally located. Would I stay here again? Not sure. I would give it some thought as the electrical issue, no lift to the basement, and the disorganization with not having our information ready on time would have me searching else where. If I had to stay here again based on location only - absolutely!", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "midlands", "Title": "\u201cnot organisied\u201d", "Author": "MidlandsJonney", "ReviewID": "UR77517784", "Content": "i stayed here for two night, when i arrived to check inn at 2pm, opened the door and the room was a tip, it was like the apartment got robbed. this was very distressing for me and my partner. i contacted the reception via phone.. they told me they were understaffed for cleaners. finally checked in 5.30pm. this almost ruined my hoilday.. up until they offered me the first night free. even though the receptionist kept telling me lies to when i will check inn. this is my first time staying here. even though the aprtment is valur for money, nice, clean and great location, as it was buzzing constanly around our area.. as was some free concert happening in the area. was awesome.", "Date": "August 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cBetter than an hotel\u201d", "Author": "Geert-Hilde", "ReviewID": "UR71212797", "Content": "Last month I payed 150 euro for a 2* hotel, now 140 euro for a spacious and clean apartment that can be compared with a 4* suite in an hotel.
