The rooms were as advertised (150 square feet), \"extra clean\" (as \"clean\" as any hotel you will find), with outstanding amenities you would usually not find in a hotel at this low price---flat-screen TV's and laptop computers with fast-speed internet in each room! There was a staff person available at the desk 24 hours a day, and each staff person (whether morning or night) went out of their way to assist us with maps, directions, suggestions, etc. Each staff person spoke both English and Italian. The staff treated us as if we were their \"family members\". The continental breakfast, served in a restaurant next door, consisted of a sweet roll or donut of your choice and one drink (coffee or juice). You can purchase additional food items if you wish, though we found that enough food to get our days started. The location of this hotel in Rome is EXCELLENT---literally across the street from the main railway station in Rome---Termini Station. That may or may not sound \"bad\" to you. The atmosphere on this main street around the Termini Station was \"safe\" with plenty of stores, restaurants, etc., and no one \"bothered\" us at any time as we left or returned to the hotel. This is an ideal location, because you can walk or take the subway from Termini station to anywhere you wish to go. The area \"felt\" really safe, and we experienced NO \"unpleasant\" experiences whatsoever---either at the hotel or outside the hotel. The bus from the airport stopped at Termini station. After we got off the bus, we had to walk only 20 yards (20 meters) to the front door of the hotel. Really nice after a long international flight! The elevator is \"typical\" of many European hotels---holding only 2 or 3 people. If you have more people in your group that than, the elevator will be back in 2 minutes---again, \"no problem\". The room is about the same size as most inside cabins on most cruise ships---not \"large\", but \"adequate\". If you are out and about sightseeing in Rome, you will use your hotel room primarily to sleep anyway. We plan to stay there again on our trip to Rome next year, so we highly recommend the Hotel Viennese if you are looking for a clean hotel, great staff, and excellent location while in Rome. You won't find a better hotel for the money in Rome!", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surfers Paradise, Australia", "Title": "\u201cwhat a terrible place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Robyn L", "ReviewID": "UR120075020", "Content": "Do not ever stay here it is shocking. We arrived late in the night and had made arrangements for a late check in but our room that we had booked for 4 nights was given away and they put us into the Viennese No.2 or so they called it. It was a dump I have seen closets bigger than the room they gave us, and there was three of us. The bathroom or what they called the bathroom had a shower curtain that went around the toilet and a towel at the door so the water wouldn't run into the room.

Better value obviously if you book directly from hotel.Hotel Viennese is a 1 star category only because they have no more than 15 rooms. In Italy the stars category are given only for the number of rooms. located a short distance from Rome's Termini Station on the north side. As you are leaving the Station, by track n.1, you are on Via Marsala Hotel Viennese in on this street. Looked eerie entering the building and hotel in on 4th floor small elevator up. They have other rooms in the area , we have stayed in three of their buildings not sure how many they have. Hotel Viennese 2 is around the corner from via marsala take the first turning on the left (via millaza i think) , after exiting hotel viennese , Evergreen another building is only a few meters down this street on the right.Rooms basic very clean, internet in each room free, very firendly staff , remembered us which is nice The hotel Viennese does not have a restaurant, but has agreed with one of the best restaurants in the area a convention to our customers by offering less comprehensive ranges from 10.00 / 15.00 to a maximum of Euro 25, 00. You can present yourself directly to the Mino Restaurant located in Via Milazzo 18 like a costumer of Hotel Viennese. Supermarket nearby in Termini downstairs or despar shopacross the road.

Space was tight however we got what we paid for, in general the room was a bargain, one of the few places with a room that sleeps 5, 1 bunk, 1 twin and one full bed. Have some humor and enjoy the saving. The elevator got to be the very first one built on this planet, a true adventure to ride and in case you forgot how to pray you will remember it riding this cage on a rope, or if you prefer walk 4 stories schlepping your suitcase. You pick, again good humor is of essence. Breakfast was a few steps away in a cafe at the corner, you will receive a voucher from the hotel. Right accross from the cafe is a small grocery store with literally everything you need. Sandwiches, salads breads, cold cuts, water all at grocery store prices and having a refridgerator in the room helped a lot. We went on a 11 day mediterranian cruise and rather spnd the money on that then an overpriced hotel in Rome. Like the previous revews said the hotel is just a few steps from stazione termini, gateway to take the bus for arround 10 euros to Fumicino airport, allow at least 1.5 hrs for the ride due to heavy traffic in rome. Or take the 1 hr train ride for arround 10 euros to Romes Cruise port Civitaveccia. The colloseum is about 20 walking minutes away or you can take the city bus or metro to get there. Again I would stay again at the Viennese due to price and friendly staff. Would not stay 2 weeks there however totally ok for a couple of nights.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gaithersburg MD", "Title": "\u201cExpected the worst and was generally pleased\u201d", "Author": "dbcmdc", "ReviewID": "UR115183492", "Content": "I was a bit leery of the place before arriving having read the reviews and having stayed at bad Termini hotels in the past, but we really wanted a decent place close to the train station.

In short, this hotel will provide you a decent, clean, recently remodeled, reasonably priced, air-conditioned room right across the street from the Termini station. The staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast in the morning is served at a smoky, dingy bar a couple of doors up. It was OK and got us the start we needed.
