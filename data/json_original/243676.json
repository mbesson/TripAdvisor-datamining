If you stay at this hotel, plan on paying ridiculous prices, OR try to jam everything into their \"free\" 10 minuets \"per 24 hour period\" OR go next door and steal wifi from the Ramada. To me, this is crazy. Just stay at the Ramada. In addition, there were no vents in the bathroom, the shower curtain hems were lovely shade of gold (from mold), the beds we're too hard and the breakfast was miserably boring. Also, our room was on the front so it was very, very noisy at night with traffic on Bayswater. On the plus side, the lotion was great for our purposes, near the Tube, our room was comfortable for 2 of us, our room had a small balcony which was cute and the staff was willing to accommodate our request to arrive one day early. I won't go back tho... The whole deal with the wifi and the stupid rule on 10 minutes every \"24 hours\" was too stupid for me. Next time I'll just go to the Ramada, where they happily give you wifi.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely would not recommend!!\u201d", "Author": "TheWalkers9113", "ReviewID": "UR116184542", "Content": "We had high hopes for a lovely stay at the Westland as it was recommended by Rick Steves. The email exchange to book a room was very friendly as well. There was not a lot of rooms available and the last email exchange had us booked in as a double for the first night, a single (we would flip a coin to see who was on the floor) and then finally a double room for the last two nights in London. I asked that we be put on a waiting list for a double room the night we had to move to a single bed and we were informed that we were at the top of the list. Yeah we thought. When we arrived at the hotel the reception was very friendly and efficient. We were informed that they had good news - we would not have to change rooms after all. We were thankful for that. What a disappointment though when we saw our room. It was very spacious with two double beds and a single but was very shabby. I could handle shabby though at 156 sterling a night (or so we thought) it seemed that the room should be better appointed. What I could not put up with was what looked like mold in the bathroom vent (see picture). I wiped down a grease mark on the wall in the bathroom and the towell was black with soot. We informed the reception of the cleanliness issue and they said they would alert housekeeping. They did clean around the vent while we were out but that was it. We decided that night that there must be healthier and less shabby accommodation to be had. We found the Best Western Phoenix around the corner on a much quieter street for only 130 sterling a night. We gave the Westland notice and put up with our second night there. What a surprise at check out to learn that they were charging us for a three bedroom room at the rate of 169 sterling minus the Rick Steeves 10% discount. In my mind it is only good service to advise customers when upgrading a room at check in that they will be paying more than what was last quoted or the hotel should give a complimentary upgrade. I think we would have been able to swallow the additional cost if the room had been remotely decent. As it was we paid the higher bill and advised the two owners who were there at check out that the room needed serious attention and they should check it out personally. The response was \"we have given a note to housekeeping\" I would have expected more from a family run business. Our stay at the Phoenix was delightful. A clean, well decorated and quiet room. If you have to venture into the Westland you had better double confirm the rate and see the room before committing. I would hope that there are well kept rooms in this hotel... I have included pictures of the wrinkles in the carpet, the threadbare bedcover, peeling paint and mildew/mold?. I will say that the breakfast was good and the gals in the breakfast room were delightful - genuinely friendly and efficient.", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cNo hot showers, Wi-Fi expensive, breakfast very mediocre\u201d", "Author": "JohnHS1", "ReviewID": "UR115697430", "Content": "We suffered 2 days without hot showers, with hotel staff making excuses about the hotel being full.

Originally we were booked in a Standard Triple room (we were two adults, one child, and a baby). We found the room a little small, though that was partly due to the fact that there were three single beds and a crib, which all took up a lot of floor space. They told us they could push two of the single beds together, but instead we opted to switch to a Deluxe room which I think was a triple, but when I originally booked it didn't seem to be available. The best thing to do is to book over the phone and tell them your needs and wants and they should be able to tell you what type of room is best. We found the Standard room a bit shoddy (in a cozy way!), but the Deluxe room was much nicer and larger, or at least better arranged, and not all that much more expensive. The Standard room had a small balcony overlooking Bayswater Road, while the Deluxe room had no balcony but overlooked the preferable side of the hotel (trees and a little bit of a view of the hotel next door). The Deluxe room was quiter, though the room facing Bayswater wasn't overly noisy. The hotel staff was very nice and helpful, and the breakfast was very good. We had it delivered to the room most mornings, and they only charge a small fee for that. The location is great if you like to be able to get into Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park easily, as we did. Being right on the Central tube line is also very convenient of course. The one thing the hotel could do that would really improve the rooms is to add smal refrigerators to the rooms. We kept some milk and yogurt for the baby in the fridge behind the counter in the lobby, and they were very nice about fetching it for us whenever we needed it, but a small fridge in the room would have helped a lot. Also, the pillow are very hard - that can be improved too.

We stayed 3 nights in early October. Great location in residential area on Bayswater Rd., across street from Kensington Gardens. Within 10 minute walk of 3 tube stations. Plenty of restaurants within a few minutes walk, and a laundry one block away. Our room, with balcony, faced Kensington Gardens, and was very quiet with large double-pane door/window. The room was large, by European standards, and very clean. The en-suite bathroom was also large, had combo bath/shower with plenty of towels, pressure and hot water. There is a bit of confusion in the breakfast room about full-English. If your room rate includes it, be sure to tell the staff. The continental breakfast is very basic. The reception staff was very helpful, with suggestions on transportation, eating, ATMs, etc. The manager, Shirley, was very helpful in getting us a refund on some long distance calls made from the room using an independent provider. Be aware! Would stay again in a minute!", "Date": "November 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cThese hoteliers were our saviours after a real bad experience...\u201d", "Author": "CazzaScotland", "ReviewID": "UR10149243", "Content": "The kind people from the Westland Hotel took us in when we had nowhere to go after walking out of another filthy hovel of a hotel called the Blue Bell in Notting Hill. It was 5pm on a Saturday night in London with nowhere to stay but when we knocked on their door, a warm welcome awaited us when they heard our plight. The owners really put themselves out - they did not actually have a room for us, but offered us the flat on the top floor for 1 night, then said they could provide a proper bedroom for the next 2 nights. We gladly took them up on their offer. We found the hotel very comfortable and clean, the reception staff extremely kind and helpful - they go that extra mile to make your stay a pleasant one and make you welcome! Really lovely hot breakfast - all freshly cooked to order! Piping hot, which is the only way! Very peaceful, relaxing experience, after a most horrendous fright when we were shown the accommodation at the hotel we had originally booked. We walked out of a nightmare into a haven of friendliness and helpfulness and felt at home during our stay.

It is just what you expect from an old English hotel: a large lobby, well decorated in an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old-fashioned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd style and very kind staff. We booked a single and a double room. The former was a rather small room at the rear of the hotel, the latter was a spacious room on the 5th floor with a wide view on Kensington Gardens. Westland is situated on the very busy Bayswater road, but the double glazed windows tempered the traffic noise, although this will probably not be sufficient on the first three floors. There are several bus stops in front of the hotel and the underground is about 300 meters away. This means that there is a direct connection with the city centre and the Royal Albert Hall as well (bus 70). There is a very nice bar, the Black Lions, near the corner of Bayswater Road and Queensway, where you can have a good meal and nice wine at reasonable prices. The Bar Churchill Arms is worth the visit too (take the bus in the direction of the Albert Hall). There are several good restaurants in the neighbourhood. There is no air-conditioning, so during warm periods it might be rather unpleasant, certainly if you let the street noise prevent you from opening a window. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t our problem at all, as the weather was rather rainy. The rooms are carpeted and well decorated and have a trouser press, an ironing board, a desk, a linen cupboard, a TV (only 5 channels) + radio and coffee/tea facilities (but without the usual coffee- or teabags). Our beds had very good mattresses and blankets that smelled a little dusty (which was no problem after I beat my blankets after the first night). There is a large bathroom with a hair dryer, a tub and a shower, but showering is a problem. In the single room it was impossible to take a shower in the morning: if the tap is coming above point 3 on a 10 points scale, there is no hot water. In the double room the water pressure varies from a small jet to normal. In this bathroom the ventilator works night and day, and you cannot switch it off. We informed the staff, but no action was taken. Continental breakfast was included in the price of the room and consisted of juice, toasted bread, butter, jam/marmalade and tea or coffee. For an additional 8 pounds (about 12 euro) it is possible of having a full English breakfast. Then you can also have cornflakes, eggs, bacon, sausage and porridge or kippers or baked beans or cheese and hot chocolate. For this price, I have had better breakfasts. We booked through Buro Britan in Amsterdam and paid 525,00 euro for both rooms, which is really a good offer. Will we return at that price? Probably yes, but only when we can have a room far from Bayswater road.", "Date": "August 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ann Arbor, MI", "Title": "\u201cVery large rooms for a reasonable price\u201d", "Author": "Greenlady56", "ReviewID": "UR8044580", "Content": "The Westland Hotel offers very large rooms for a reasonable price by London standards.
