In total we had 3 different rooms on 2 floors. I'll start out by saying this is an older hotel. The wall paper is peeling in some places. The elevator is crazy slow and I had to go to the lobby twice to get towels becasue they werent finished doing laundry when they cleaned our room. Those are the worst things I can say about this hotel. It is on the boardwalk. I paid $427 total for a 3 day holiday weekend. The staff was very freindly and accomodating. We had a balcony with a side view, which was a great view. If that is important I would suggest requesting a room on floor 4 or 5. If you get a lower room on the one side you might be looking at the building next door. Our room was cleaned every day. Overall it was a good experience. I would definately reccommend this hotel to others.", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGlad I didn't cancel!\u201d", "Author": "smgraci89", "ReviewID": "UR139016221", "Content": "I was very nervous to stay at the Americana after reading the reviews, but my stay was JUST FINE. I feel the need to put a good review on here to help the place out! For the VERY cheap price, the few bumps along the road are completely worth it! Let me first say that as a 23 year old female, I'm a little picky and easily grossed out by dirty rooms - this place had no effect on me. It was clean, spacious, and lets be honest.. I didn't expect to spend much time in the room anyway! I only have 2 things to complain about after a week long stay; 1. The door to the back patio was difficult to open, and difficult to close/lock. 2. All of the stairway doors had a sign that said \"Emergency Exit Only - Alarm Will Sound If Opened\" so we were forced to take the elevators. However, there may have been an alternative had I asked the front desk. Thats it! So, if you're thinking about cancelling and you expect to spend 90% if your vaca in the room, maybe you want somewhere with a flat screen and free WIFI. But if you're just looking for a cheap, clean place to lay your head after a day on the beach and a night on the boardwalk, STAY HERE! :)", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPleased\u201d", "Author": "Gr8tApostle", "ReviewID": "UR138883870", "Content": "My family and I traveled from NJ to Ocean City,MD for our annual vacation.

I itched all night and my BF woke up with welts. Springs got me in the back all night to the point where i just gave it up and fought back the tears of exhaustion. The shower was equally as awful.

She said she only saw one room under our name when we had three reserved. She also didn't know if our rooms were ready. She told us to go up and check. What hotel does that? So we finally get our room keys after struggling to find a parking spot in their small parking lot. We walk in one room and a guy was sitting on the bed watching tv and smoking a cigarette. He was a worker there. The lock didn't work on that door and the toliet holder was on the floor behind the bathroom door. In the other room there was hair everywhere and it was never cleaned up the whole time I was there. The sliding doors can barely be seen out of because of the nasty scum in between the glass. You can't dial out on their telephone in the rooms period. You can't contact the front desk unless you call the main number from a cell phone. The \"penthouse suite\" if that's what you wanna consider it, does not have PRIVATE balconies. You cannot have visitors period. We had family members come up from another hotel and we had security knocking on our door with the owner. Then they gave us a list of rules for the place AFTER we got in trouble instead of when we got there.The rules included no alchol if any person under 18 was in the room with you and absolutely no alchol on the balcony. I had a maid sign up for hours the 3rd day I was there and they NEVER cleaned it. Free WiFi? YEAH RIGHT you can't get a connection unless you're sitting in the hallway which is extremely hot. The elevator is so slow and hot too. The AC in the room was horrible. The only clean thing about this place was the shower. The beds only had a sheet and comforter, no blankets. The microwaves, tvs, and phones were all different in every room. The staff takes every thing as a joke and laughs and everything you say. They pretend they can't understand you and you can't understand them. The jacuzzi worked but it's small and very loud. The maids fold sheets and towels up right out in the lobby. There were only three carrying carts for the entire hotel. It took forever for us to even get one to bring our luggage to our room. The indoor pool was very tiny and dirty.

My husband and I sat for days on end looking at hotels in Ocean City trying to make a decision. Like most we didn't want to spend a fortune on a hotel that we were just going to sleep in, we didn't go on vacation to sit in the hotel room. Finally we came across the Americana, and it had one of the best prices, especially for a hotel right on the boardwalk. Not to Mention the hotel is on 10th street, Which is a greatttt location on the boardwalk, all the shops are around there, anything after 14th street is just hotels and only a handful of shops. We arrived on a Monday at 10am, Check in time isn't until 3pm. But they were nice enough to let us do our paper work in advance so we would be able to park our car in the parking lot before check in (Make sure you do this if you arrive early...they will tow you). The room was ready by 2pm an hour earlier then promised. The rooms are pretty large, we were on the 4th floor with a \"side view\" you can still clearly see the beach from there. The first thing I did was check for bed bugs, and I was relieved when I came up with nothing. The room was very clean. The maids were great they cleaned the room everyday, we left personal items out in the open with our Cell phones and nothing was touched. The only thing I have to complain about, is the second night were were there there was no hot water when I was trying to give my children a bath, Which I guess is to be expected with such a large hotel. The people were very nice and didn't bother us at all. We came and went as we pleased. They do have an Indoor heated pool, which some other reviews complained about sand being in the bottom. There is sand in the bottom of the pool, but there is really no way to keep the sand out. They do supply a shower in the pool room and there are signs up to please rinse off all sand before going into the pool. The two short times we were in the pool room, we saw many people just jump in with sand all over them. Overall I think this hotel is great for the price and the location couldn't be better, if you have small children its great to not have to cross a road to get to the beach. If your looking for something super fancy then go somewhere else, you get what you pay for. And the Americana is totally worth the money paid.

My stay was from an arrival on Thursday to a departure on Sunday The 'no hot water' occured on Saturday and continued on Sunday. 2) No AC with the exception of opening the screen less balcony door and allowing, thakn goodness, a cool ocean breeze to make things somewhat comfortable. 3) Wallpaper that lack an adhesive backing meaning = peeling away from the walls. 4) a wood slate between the matress and boxspring of one bed. I guess this is their interpretation of a sturdy comfortable bed. 5) Two plastic chairs on the balcony that the last time they saw their original white color was when they were purchased. Please, at least spend 9.99 for a new plastic chair. 6) Cockroaches in the hallway/ stairwells 7) Not witnessed by myself hoiwever said bug in my friends room. 8)An oily smell that seemed to eminate from the downstairs lobby.

We decided to go down on a whim to see the beach one last time before winter. We were looking for something close to the boardwalk, also with an indoor pool. We thought we had found that with the Americana. Boy, were we wrong!!! We got there in the afternoon and just dropped our bags off in the doorway. At that time, the room had a \"closed-up\" smell. We didn't think too much of it at the time---that was our first mistake. We returned to our room about 4 hours later to check out the indoor pool. It was very small, which was okay (so it shouldn't be much to clean, right???) When we looked into the pool at the lights, you could see scum floating on the top of the water. It looked like it had an oily residue floating, but the scum looked like dead skin, like someone had sunburn and peeled. Yuck!!! I'm getting shivers just thinking about it. We said something to the girl at the front desk, and she looked at us like she didn't hear or understand us. At that time, we went back to room, and tried to turn on the air conditioner. That and the TV did not work. We still thought the room smelled a little musty. We thought it just needed the air on. They did send someone up right away, to fix these things. So, we left and went back out for the evening. When we returned from the boardwalk after midnight, the stench of the room knocked us over! We thought it was coming from the air conditioner, but wasn't sure. It did get more humid out as the evening went on, so this must have brought on the smell. My fiance went down to the front desk to say something, and the first thing he was told was, \"you should have said something right away\", and that there is nothing they could do about it now. He said we would have to take it up with the manager in the morning, that he could not do anything about a refund. (Plus, he told my fiance the room we were in went for $79 a night, but since it was Sunfest Weekend we were charged $139.) We knew we wouldn't get another room that late in the night, so he asked for some air freshener or something. They did provide that, which helped a little. The beds seemed to have clean sheets and the towels were clean. That and the view are about the only nice thing to say. We had the same problems with the sliding door and the elevators, as did other people who reviewed here. In the morning, we asked to speak to the manager, and again we got a blank stare. We asked again, and got a curt \"manager is not here\". We know we will never get refunded, but I just hope this will help someone else not to make the same mistake we made.

Looking back, I think I rather would have drove the 7 hours back home. They brought us a cot right away with the sheets all tied down to it with a dirty strap. The room was full of stains. There were stains on the carpet, stains on the ceiling, stains on the seats of the chairs, and even stains on the lamp shades! The dining table had a leg broken off of it, and the leg was taped and glued back together. The patio's cement floor was stained too! And the patio chairs were those cheap plastic white ones. The patio chairs were dirty. Our view from the balcony was of an alleyway with a dumpster. Garbage was all over the alleyway. We also had a view of a roof of the building next door. It was full of sea gull droppings. Yuck! The room was also a smoking room, when we had requested non-smoking. When we went to leave the room to head to dinner, our hotel room door would not lock. We had to have maintenance come to completely remove the locking mechanism. We waited around for about 1 hour for them to do this. Then we finally left for dinner--at first making sure that our door would lock! The elevator was SLOW, and always crowded. It would start with a jerk. The hallway carpet was in some spots covered with sand. When we returned to the room to sleep for the night, we had to make up the extra cot ourselves. Trying to sleep was impossible!

Sleeping in the heat was more relaxing than sleeping with a loud air conditioner! Some of the other reviews mentioned that the employees of the hotel spoke with accents.

There was one younger girl that I give some credit for being nice and even working there! I honestly felt after our stay that even the fair rate this hotel had was a rip off. Oceanfront or not, you still need a clean, usable room and good service.", "Date": "June 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cBetter Than Expected\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3324394", "Content": "On a whim, my family decided to do a day trip to OC. It had been a very long time since my wife and I had been to OC and never had my children traveled there. I did an internet search and booked the Americana for two nights since the off season rate seemed reasonable, location (oceanfront-10th street and boardwalk) was close to the action etc.. The day after I booked the Americana, this TripAdvisor hit me with some pretty bad reviews. Images of the aftermath of spring break teens, smoked filled rooms and all gave some concern. Actually, if you read some of the other reviews you'd think the health department...well, let me clear things up for you. The people at the front desk are very friendly. The lobby, pool room, hallways were not smoked filled. I would recommend a makeover in terms of paint/wallpaper, but all in all our first impression was good. Our room was on the Penthouse level which included a 2 1/2 person jacuzzi tub. Everything was operational and the room included a kitchenette with a refrigerator and microwave that were invaluable for heating up leftovers etc. Not the Taj Mahal, but well run and clean. The best thing about the Americana is the location, close to some good restaurants/shops and the pier. My family had a nice stay at The Americana. If you are on a budget and location is important to you, I would stay at The Americana.", "Date": "April 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cThe Bad Reviews are True!!!!!

My boyfriend and I read the bad reviews before we stayed in the Americana hotel, but we thought we would give it a try anyway since the price was right and we had already made reservations (by the way you have to cancel 10 DAYS IN ADVANCE)!!! We stayed there the 18th and 19th of February, and we would not stay there again. No matter where you went in the hotel there was a HORRIBLE smoke smell. We asked for a non-smoking room, but there were 2 ashtrays in the room. Both nights, the receptionist as well as other guests were smoking throughout the lobby. My boyfriend had to go to the bathroom when we got there, but we ended up having to clean the bathroom first. There were NASTY urine stains ALL OVER the toilet and all over the toilet seat, and the whole bathroom was very gross....it didn't look like it had been cleaned properly in quite a while. We ended up having to buy sanitizing wipes so that we could disinfect the entire room before we were able to use it. The floors had not been vacuumed, and they were not cleaned the second day either...so we felt the need to wear our shoes and socks the whole time. There were stains throughout the room...even the ceiling. The room did not have an alarm clock (which I have NEVER experienced before), so we never knew what time it was. There was a coffee maker, but there was no coffee or filters....what good is that??? There were two of us staying in the room, and we only received one washcloth and one towel.....NO BATH MAT!!!!!!! As mentioned in other reviews, the sliding glass door was very difficult to open and close, and we could hear the other guests opening and slamming theirs as well. We didn't even attempt to use the pool...we were tooooooo afraid. As we rode the EXTREMELY slow elevator down on check-out morning with two other couples, the mood was anything but happy and friendly. These two couples seemed as annoyed and disappointed as we were. The only good thing about the hotel was the view outside and the location. My family, as well as my boyfriend\u2019s family, has been staying in Ocean City for over 30 years. Rumor in ocean city is that the hotels along the boardwalk are inadequate because of the high school and college kids who come and stay in cheap places to get drunk. This is the main reason why we have avoided staying in no name hotels and motels. The Americana Hotel is a prime example of the unacceptable conditions that plague hotels along the boardwalk.", "Date": "February 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201ca disaster\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2967839", "Content": "we have stayed at this hotel many times and while it it not the best it was always adequate until my last trip on oct. 27th 2004. we had a smoke free room but when we entered the smell of smoke was terrible. the balcony was filthy and there was a plastic cup will with wet cigerette butts. half the lights did not work and the room was quite dirty. when we complained, we were shown another room. this one was worse than ours. all in all we looked at 7 rooms. one had mold two feet high on the bathroom wall. in another room when my wife turned on the light the bulb exploded and we had to bring her to the emergency room. when we got back at 1;30 in the morning we demanded out money back (they did give us the money) and we went next door to the paridise hotel which was beautiful.", "Date": "December 31, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cReally a good deal.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2333166", "Content": "I was surprised to read some of the negative reviews of the Americana. I'll grant you that the hotel is not the Taj Mahal, but it was a pretty good place for the in season side view room we had on the sixth floor. The room we stayed in was clean, and the maids were very friendly and kept things in order while we wree there. The bathrooms were not spotless, but I've seen worse in places where I had paid more. The indoor pool is small, but it served our children well during one rainy day we had. The place was very quiet. We never heard noise from other guests, and being on the sixth floor, we heard no street noise. The balcony will seat about four adults. The chairs were not very clean on the balcony, and on the sixth floor, the balconies were not covered. The elevators were slow, and the hotel offers no assistance in transporting luggage from the lobby to your room. There are carts available to take it up, and there appeared to be plenty of parking for guests. We got a spot very close to the door and had a spot during our entire stay. The staff was mostly foreign, but you come to expect this in Ocean City, Md. Nearly every store or restaurant is either managed by foreign residents or has foreign people working there. I have absolutely no problem with this. The workers were very friendly at all times and were quite helpful whenever we had a question or need. If you're looking for a cheap place to stay in Ocean City in a good central boardwalk location with very nice ocean views, then consider the Americana. It's not the vacation hotel of your dreams, but if you want a good low budget option, I'd say go for it. We're planning to go to Ocean City, MD, again next year, and will consider the Americana again.", "Date": "July 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cWARNING- DO NOT STAY HERE!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2317304", "Content": "This hotel is owned/operated by foriegners who speak broken english (their english gets worse when there is a problem).

The patio furniture was covered in a thick layer of dirt and was unuseable. The microwave was broke and the buttons on the old phone stuck. They advertise cribs as being available. When we requested one, they tried to tell us there were none. After complaining, it took several hours to assemble one from storage. Then they attempted to charge us $10 a day rent for it!
