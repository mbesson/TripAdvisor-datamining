The room was a reasonable size, the beds comfortable, and everything was clean. The breakfast was spectacularly large and freshly cooked. A couple of minor quibbles: coffee was served from vacuum flasks, which meant that it was thoroughly stewed by the time we got to it; and here and there the building was fraying around the edges a little. However, the hotel is apparently about to close for renovations, which will no doubt remedy the latter issue. It's to be hoped that the refurbed hotel won't have higher prices though!", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boulder, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cA definite improvement!\u201d", "Author": "Richard B", "ReviewID": "UR121530375", "Content": "This was my second visit - the first being about 2 years ago and not particularly memorable - I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised!

We stayed here while my wife was in the highgate hospital. The only reason we booked in to the hotel was to get some sleep for the 3 hour drive home the next day as I didnt fancy driving all that way without a decent nights sleep in the chair next to her bed. Total waste of money ! We booked 2 single rooms which were both small but functional and a fair reflection of the price. I stayed in room 8 and my mother in law just down the hall. In the cavity wall behind the head board of my head was a noisy part of the plumbing/boiler that loudly rumbled everytime a tap was put on. (constantly all night). It's about as loud as a car engine at idle. I was so tired and in bed I put in my headphones for earplugs and tried to get to sleep. Tossed and turned until 03:55 when 2 guys and a girl checked in to the room next door. They were loud but not so much so that it would have been an issue were it not for the fact the walls appear to be made of card they are so thin. This went on for about 45 mins - 1 hour. Then the traffic starts, The old aluminum windows are so useless you might as well be sat in the road it is so noisy. When I met my mother in Law for breakfat (which was quite good) I discovered that her stay was no better and we were both exhausted and had got a couple of hours sleep each. I honestly would have beenbbetter off sleeping in the car. We complained in the morning. I'm not expecting much for the money only that it is clean and that I get a good nights sleep, simple. It is clean to be fair, but don't bother coming here for sleep. At first they acted supprised and claimed never to have heard any noise. however as I persisted this turned to \"must be the boiler above one of the rooms again\" to \"we keep telling the owner it needs to get sorted\" to find that exactly the same thing is already on here proves they know all about these issues and just chance it. They also seemed to think I was reponsible for the noise for not getting dressed at 4 in the morning and confronting the drunk guys next door. (this place is all about service)! Exhausted, tired and gumpy I flat refused to pay the bill in full and eventually after great protest we agreed on \u00a375 for both rooms instead of the \u00a3110. I was too tired to argue further. The lady on recepton took my number and said she would get the owner/manager to give me a call the next day. I have waited 3-4 days and no one has bothered. If they had just called and appologised I wouldn't have been bothered to log on here and register my dissatisfation. They didn't, so I did !", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood value accommodation in Muswell Hill\u201d", "Author": "Grecofan2", "ReviewID": "UR117039201", "Content": "We stayed here for one night in order to attend a family party in Highgate.
