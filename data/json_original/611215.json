There were two snags, though \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so I want to advise you how to react in the unlikely event that one happens to you \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 because apart from my misfortunes, this is a pretty terrific place that you should enjoy. Issue #1 was a reservations foul-up, resulting in my first night being spent in a nearby competitor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who put me in a drastically deficient room. The day after, I discussed this at length with Agan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gracious staff, who seemed genuinely regretful yet unable to compensate me beyond a beer or a shuttle to the airport. In the off chance that you wind up down the street in a tiny room with a lumpy bed, broken window, no TV remote or security lock and a brick-wall view, tell Hotel Agan immediately. Agan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rooms are far better than that, and (as in all things) they will want to make things right for you \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more easily fixed before the poorer room is endured. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hassle and a time drain, so weigh accordingly. Issue #2 is the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thin walls. It was noticeable but not a problem until the final night, when a party next door cranked up at 2AM til sunrise. Noisy guests can happen anywhere, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less insulation here from bad neighbors. On the other hand, I toughed it out instead of banging on the wall or alerting the front desk; either action might have fixed things. (Here and elsewhere, I found that Istanbul pretty much demands pushback.) Those issues aside? I really liked Agan. My room was clean, attractive, and very comfortable; it offered a swell neighborhood view, and had the perfect undertone of lively street life in the evening. Room amenities are rather generous for such reasonably priced lodging. Location is marvelous, a quick walk to both Sultanahmet and Eminonu. Agan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s adjoining restaurant provided the most extensive free breakfast of my travels in Turkey.

Knowing this was the touristy area we had some idea of what to expect. Nothing however prepared us for this place. Finding the entrance was a bit tricky as all you see is the bar outside with music blaring from it. The staff are mostly made up of 18-24 year old men who constantly had to ask one another how to do things such as run the card, find the room keys etc. They often were sitting outside in the bar area waiting for guests to come back and then try to convince them to have a drink with them in the bar. The room was pretty small with what looked like lady Gaga music video decor. (looked better in the picture online). The flat screen TV had a complex set up to get it to work with the satellite system but overall was fine. A/C worked but we had to go and ask for the remote from reception which of course required the man/boy working the desk to go off and ask someone else where it was and then find some batteries for it. The room was clean and once the A/C was going it was ok. Bathroom was clean with a decent shower. The small fridge didn't work or had run out of coolent. WIFI worked fine. The hallway noise on our floor was fairly tremendous. There was no sound insulation in this place at all. The main issues with the place arose a bit later in the evening. The before mentioned bar gets going around 8PM and does not stop until around 3AM. The bar apparently turns into a club with the music vibrating the entire place. Again the guys running the desk take over the bar and make it their own Discotechque at night. We should not forget the interlude of the singer/guitarist. He is one of the guys working at the hotel and knows five songs. Yes, literally five songs and he will play them in repeated fashion over and over again for about an hour (with guitar solo interludes) and he will be there every night. Getting to the hotel in the evening requires you to run a gauntlet of men standing in front of menus placed in lit glass covered tables. They will literally stand one after the other and try to force you to look at their menu. There are a minimum of five of these to get to the hotel door. This would be okay, if the fifth person wasn't one of the guys who worked at your own hotel and was constantly reminding you of the 6% (odd number) discount you get by drinking at the bar. Breakfast was buffet style. For one or two days would be bearable. After that, you'll be looking to find another place to go. Breads, spreads, feta cheese, fruit, olives, cereal, tea (strong), coffee (weak) is served in the bar in the morning. Multiple flatscreen TV's with music videos running are on all the walls. The stickiness from the night before is still somewhat to be found on the tables and chairs in the bar area. There is a litter of kittens that live outside and even though they are extremely cute to watch play, after seeing them run across all of the tables (having done a good job of grooming themselves prior) you start to get the idea that this place is 1 part hotel, 2 parts zoo. The finale ended with trying to book tickets on an airport shuttle. As we were leaving from the Asian side (further away) we decided this seemed to be the best and easiest way of getting there. We were reassured when we got there that the shuttles run everyday with no issue and to just get a ticket from someone at reception the day before leaving. So the afternoon before we take off, we go to the desk to buy our tickets. The kid (maybe 17?) at the desk starts to write out the ticket and takes the credit card. After swiping the card but not being able to figure out the CC machine, he asks the oldest of the group how to run the machine. This man asks why, and he tells him it's for tickets to the airport shuttle. The response is there is no airport shuttle for the next day. No reason for it, just no shuttle. However the sign for the shuttle bus was still in the lobby. We got there with tram, funicular, bus ride that required leaving four hours earlier than the shuttle would have. I think we would have had a much, much better time on our trip in Istanbul if we had not stayed here. The place was centrally located and easy to walk to the various tourist sights so at least were able to get away from it easily enough, but that isn't want you want in a hotel.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kazan", "Title": "\u201cI am very happy for such small money it was great.\u201d", "Author": "KazanAisha", "ReviewID": "UR115175080", "Content": "This is a great place to stay in Istanbul. very convenient location, excellent staff. clean and comfortable rooms, excellent breakfast.

The hotel was clean, convenient, easy to find, and set in a great neighborhood close to many of the major sites such as Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya, and the Basilica Cistern. It is also very close to the Tram line so we were able to use public transit very easily to get to sites farther away from our hotel. Also, the great staff helped us figure out which bus to take to locations off the Tram line. One of the best things about Istanbul were the wonderfully friendly people we met every day there. The people at Hotel Agan were no exception. The absolute best part about this hotel was the staff. They made us feel very welcome immediately upon our arrival and made sure to make us feel at home during our entire stay. I have already recommended Hotel Agan to many friends traveling to Istanbul, and I myself would love to go back and stay there again! It was a good value, the breakfast was nice to have right there in the hotel, and the outdoor bar seating area was a very comfortable and relaxing area to sit and soak up Istanbul. The rooms were a bit small but this was not a big deal at all. We were two people in a room with two single beds and it worked fine for us. The bathroom was plenty spacious. The street outside was a bit noisy late at night, but again - this was no big deal. This is all part of staying in a big city. It was a fun to look out the window and watch the street scene. A couple of times at breakfast the scrambled eggs in the warmer were slightly less than warm, but overall I thought the breakfast was great. Again, the best things about this place were the price, location, and above all - the wonderfully amazing staff.

Besides that, the hotel was cheap and really nice. Make sure to utilize the airport shuttle provided by the hotel as it is actually cheaper and taxis have a hard time finding the place.

The soundproofing between rooms was also lacking... no one wants to wake up to moaning/mooing sounds at 9 in the morning. Adding to our lack of sleep was a double bed with a twin blanket (or at least a blanket that was way to small) for the two of us, which would have been fine for one but left us in a blanket tug of war all night. Also, we put our do not disturb sign on the door, but the maid tried to open the door several times while we were sleeping and then finally she knocked until we woke up and handed us some towels. Granted it was 1 in the afternoon, but if I want to sleep until 1 I will.

We only had one evening meal at the hotel and it was very nice, the rest of the time we ran the gauntlet of the nearby restaraunts before making up our mind - this was actually great fun and should not be seen as a trial or an irritant. It is all good natured and some good deals can be made for a discounted meal. We intend returning to Istanbul and the hotel Agan will be my first choice for a room. Excellent value for money with the most amazing staff. Almost forgot to mention the breakfast which was complimentary to the room. A good selection of food and plenty of it providing for a great start to the day.", "Date": "August 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Welcoming Hotel, Friendly Staff, Recommended!!\u201d", "Author": "basimamin92", "ReviewID": "UR73658252", "Content": "This hotel had very friendly staff and very helpful, clean and well air conditioned rooms.

They changed my single to a triple, for only 15 Euros a night extra, I was staying 2 nights. This is very comparable to a hostel rate in the area, so for 15euros extra my boy had a good bed, the room was comfortable, big double and a single bed, tele, excellent shower room, AIR CONNED!!! and free bath stuff and slippers provided. Room was cleaned every day, breakfast, which was included, was a good buffet. Hotel has free internet and is local to attractions and the docks as to get to Taksim, Istanbul centre. I would def recommend this hotel to anyone, for the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff, the locations. Two tips I have for people staying at the Agan 1: From airport don't get taxi or shuttle bus, which can cost up to 20euros. Get the metro (M1) to Zeytinburnu, about 6/7 stops. All trams and transport uses tokens, which costs 1.5 Turkish liras, and you can get this at every station via the vending machines. At Zeytinburnu, change to tram line, I think it was T2, that goes to Gulhane. Get off there out the gate at the back, 1st street on right walk down to 3rd turning on right and hotel is there, about 300m from the stop. 3 Turkish Liras was about 1.5 Euros at the time compared to 20 Euros by taxis. 2: Don't have dinner in the area round the hotel. All the restaurants serves the same foods and charges about the same money. Instead, eat up in Taksim, which you get to by the same tram you came in on, across the bridge. Up there, where all the night clubs/bars/shopping are, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find a better choice of foods, much better atmosphere and here's the important thing, usually 1/3 to up to 1/2 the price you pay in the restaurants round the hotel. The above 2 tips are, of course, my views only and it is recommended you try others out. But 100% I would recommend the hotel to anyone!

More Like 3 Star!! Recommended!!!\u201d", "Author": "jangir", "ReviewID": "UR66646332", "Content": "As a solo traveler I stayed at Hotel Agan in June 2010 for 3 nights. I had initially booked a single room but upon my arrival was upgraded to a suite - first piece of good fortune. I found the hotel to be clean and the staff to be super friendly, most of whom had a very good command of English. Hotel guests also get a small discount on food from the restaurant next door. Location wise, I found the hotel to be perfect for all the sights: Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia and all the other HISTORICAL sights of Istanbul. Now I have written 'historical' in caps lock because if you are seeking to go to Istanbul to party the night away in bars and clubs, this location is NOT for you. If you are planning to travel to the Hotel from Sabiha Gokcen Airport (SAW) on a weekday be prepared to sit in traffic for a long time. During weekdays and Saturday the traffic in Istanbul can be crazy. I landed around 7pm on a Thursday and the traffic was so bad that the driver and the Hotel staff (whom the driver called) advised me to take the 15-20 minute ferry to the hotel - Agan is located about 5-10 minutes walk from the port. Paying for the ferry is about 2 Turkish Lira. If you are flying in from Istanbul Ataturk airport (IST) then on a good day it should take you about half hour to get to the Hotel (may be less). Now, although I have given the Hotel 5 stars for location, value for money, rooms and service, for sleep quality I have given it 2 stars. Why? Because right next to the Hotel are wonderful outside sofas (like being in your living room) and tables where visitors can relax, laugh and enjoy food (in large portions) and MUSIC. Music is played late into the night and you can hear the chatter and laughter of visitors from the bedrooms facing the entrance - I can't speak for the other rooms of course. Furthermore, there was a construction site not to far from the hotel and work goes on throughout the night. But both these negatives apply to ALL THE OTHER HOTELS located in this area. Please also be prepared to be woken up around 4-5 am every morning by the call to prayers from mosques dotted around the area. Another thing to note is the fact that rooms have no safety boxes. In fact these are located in reception. You are given a key and the receptionist keeps the other set. In order to open the safe both keys are needed. The only problem with this is: what would have happened if I had lost my set? The breakfast buffet (included in my reservation) is excellent. The Hotel also recommends different tours and I opted for an English tour guide run by Ulkesel Profesyonel Turist Rehberi. There is also free Internet access Finally, the Hotel is located around several Turkish Bath Houses. Although most people would advise to try traditional bath houses, I would recommend a more modern and upmarket Haman.", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGood Deal\u201d", "Author": "SteveNM", "ReviewID": "UR66461250", "Content": "I flew in from the Sabiha Gokcen airport on May 28, 2010, on a flight from London, Gatwick, via Easy Jet. Upon arriving at the airport, I was aware that a Visa was required, so I had my US Passport and $20 US ready when I lined up at the Visa entry. I showed my passport and paid my $20 and got through with no problems. Once you have your Visa, you can then go through Passport Checkin. The agents spoke English, so I was able to answer a couple of questions and was let through without any problems. I then followed the other passengers from my flight to the baggage claim area, and was able to retrieve my luggage within 10 minutes. There are signs in Turkish and English throughout the airport. Since this airport is located on the Asian side of Istanbul and my hotel was located on the other side, I had to make arrangements with an Airport Shuttle service (you can do this via internet), and had someone waiting for me with my name on a sheet of paper as I exited the airport baggage claim area. The shuttle picks up several people at the airport for 10 Euros ($6.50 US) and takes them to their destination hotels throughout Istanbul. Since we arrived at about 12:30 pm, we were unable to avoid traffic, and it took us approximately 1.5 hours to get from the airport to the hotel. So, use the bathroom before you leave the airport, and be patient \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccause the driving in Istanbul is crazy. When I got to the hotel Agan (pronounced ah-yawn), it was on a side street away from major traffic, but there were several restaurants/bars in the vicinity as well as within the hotel itself. I was met by hotel staff who were expecting me. I was assured ahead of time via e-mail in English that I could pay with a Visa Card, and they did accommodate, however, they changed the price from Euros to Turkish Lira, which essentially came out to the same amount I was quoted, so that was not an issue. Since I was trying to save money, I expected less, but Tripadvisor.com had some really good things to say about the hotel and its location, so I took a chance, and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really disappointed. I was given a room on the 3rd floor right next to the elevator, but the room itself was quiet from within the facility. I was pleasantly surprised to find a well-kept, clean, neat room with two twin beds, air conditioner, shower/bathroom, etc. Other amenities included a refrigerator (which worked tepidly if at all), and wi-fi which was very temperamental. I finally gave up and used the hotel unit on the ground floor or used my own laptop on that level when it was convenient. A flat-screen TV was also available, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to really turn it on. Breakfast was also included with the stay. The room was large and comfortable but the a/c was not very powerful during the day. Unfortunately, some nights were too hot and others were too cold \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so what can you say. My window opened up to the restaurant side of the street, however, I was not seriously bothered by the music or talking (never blaring), and things pretty much got quieter by 11 pm. Once you closed your windows, the noise was almost non-existent, but I would recommend ear plugs for those who have problem with any noise in particular. The rooms were cleaned every day, and clean towels were provided. The bathroom fixtures appeared to be a little loose. When I used the WC in the hotel restaurant, I also noticed there were problems with the fixtures there as well. Cleanliness in the room was not an issue, but the restaurant WC could have used more attention; it seemed to have a perpetual leak. I did not eat at the hotel restaurant other than to partake of the breakfast which was included with my stay. I preferred eating at the smaller restaurants in more out of the way places. Breakfast was very generous with a variety of meats, cheeses, vegetables, olives, yogurt and fruit. Orange juice, coffee and hot water were also available, and there were a variety of breads (regular and local) with small packets of honey, jam, etc., to choose from. Milk and corn flakes were also available. Breakfast started at 7:00 am. I noticed after a large group of younger people checked into the hotel, there were slim pickings at the buffet if you got there late. I felt safe traveling as a single person and walking around at night by myself throughout the city and in the area where this hotel is located. There are a variety of restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and fast food places within walking distance. There are even a couple of small grocery stores where you can buy fruit, candy, beer, wine, etc., to take back to your room, at a much reduced rate than you would pay at a specialty or other stores. ATMs are also available within walking distance and in safe areas. Please note that anywhere you go in this part of town, there are a lot of people around, and traffic is always heavy except for late at night, but that was all part of the fun and excitement too. With regard to sightseeing, this location is fantastic. I was able to see 75% of what I had planned to see while in Istanbul without ever getting on a bus or tram or metro, which were all readily accessible within yards from the hotel. Of course that means you have to like to walk (a lot), but all of the major attractions were within walking distance. When I did use public transport, there were plenty of people to ask how the service worked, and after you do it once, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a pro. There is a sightseeing cruise on the Bosphorus down near the Eminou landing that takes you for a 2-hour cruise up the Bosphorus and back for 10 TL \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss them, because they stand out shouting the tour and there are signs as well. It is not a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153guided\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tour, but it was more than worth the price of the ticket \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the guidebooks can give you all the info you need on what you will see. There are many facets to Istanbul and each quarter has its own flare. Going to Taxim square one night and walking along the shopping boulevard was a whole other Istanbul and a whole other experience, so get to as many places as you can and have the time for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and walk as much as possible. I was a bit concerned about the language difference coming to Istanbul, but I found that most people do speak English, and they are generally very friendly and kind if you approach them in the same manner. People dress in every which way, but modesty does seem to prevail and is preferred. Turkish men rarely wear shorts but some do especially the younger ones. Women are more modest in their dress and get a lot of attention when they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. My only disappointment if I had one is that Istanbul is not very conscious of its litter and garbage problem and there is a problem with smoking and smog (from the cars, ships, etc.). People throw paper, plastic, whatever, without a thought as to where it winds up, and usually that is in the water or along the streets. Walking along the Galata Bridge, you see fisherman opening the plastic bags containing whatever fishing apparatus, and they throw the wrappers on the bridge where it eventually gets blown into the water \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what a shame. I kept thinking wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it be great if they had an adopt a highway program, or some kind of program to teach young people (and old) about the problems associated with litter and pollution. I would definitely recommend this hotel and a visit to Istanbul \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is a fascinating city with much to offer.

Secondly, the hotel's website paints a glossy professional picture that is really some way from the reality. The biggest complaint is, without doubt, the bathroom, which was tiny and there was no room to hang towels. It's simply no use to have a bathroom where the shower sprays water all over the room with no receptacle or curtain or anything. This was very inconvenient. The bathroom was also poorly ventilated and had no windows, so there were large patches of damp on the ceiling and it smelled pretty awful. The bathroom door would only stay shut if slammed extremely hard. The receptionist was sympathetic, and said that the hotel was being renovated in January 2010, although whether this will improve the bathrooms or not is unclear. On the plus side, the hotel bar is pretty much the cheapest place to get a drink in the local area, and the staff were all friendly with a good, lively sense of humour. The free wifi was a plus, but the range was extremely poor, so if you ventured more than about 10 metres from the reception area, it stopped working. The room itself was reasonably clean, but a thick layer of dust adorned the radiator and the metal headboard. Although the room was cleaned every day, the towels were not changed every day, which, given that the water from the bathroom got everywhere, was disappointing. Also, the cleaners folded towels that we had hung to dry, preventing them from drying properly. The bed sheets were never changed during our week at the hotel. The room was equipped with some kind of televisual relic of the 1970s with a scabby remote whose buttons were mostly worn off. The only English channel available was BBC World News. Breakfast was included in the cost of the room but we were extremely disappointed by the selection and general standard. Every single plate in the stack was so wet that water would drip off it onto the floor when tilted. There were only two cereals on offer, and bread with a single type of cheese and cold meat, although there was a large range of salad. Sadly the supply runs out quickly and unless you arrive for breakfast reasonably early, all of the popluar things have gone. When we arrived on the first day, we were told that the room was not ready for us, and we were made to walk to a nearby hotel. We tried to arrange for some compensation for this but the hotel was having none of it, and seemed generally uninterested at the inconvenience caused. The general state of the hotel is poor, with horrible-looking cleaning cupboards (some were left open and visible) and a tiny lift that has no interior door, so it would be perfectly possible to get some loose clothing caught between floors while the lift was in motion. I could not recommend this hotel less, and would choose it again only if the last available option was a park bench.

The staff is very freindly, and almost all of them can communicate in English well enough. We took a two-bed room. The room was bit small, but manageable. There was almost daily supply of toilet paper, shampoo, soap etc. Fresh towels were provided every day. The room had a cupboard, a writing table, and a room refrigerator. The air conditioning unit was excellent. Although the TV was there, the only english channel was the BBC World News. All others were Turkish channels.

However, that was not the problem due to the hotel, but rather due to the company that operates shuttle bus service.

On checking out I was a bit concerned as my airport transfer was running late: the very kind receptionist offered to call the company with his mobile phone and reassured me the transfer was on its way! Please note the company had nothing to do with the hotel as I had booked it on the Internet prior to my trip. This has to be good service!!!

Hotel Agan was our only decidedly negative experience. Initially, it seemed like a nice enough place. The woman who checked us into our room was very friendly and the location was fabulous (as long as you don't mind the very persistent touts in front of every restaurant on the street). First negative experience: we attempted to shower. Many of the hotels and pensions we stayed in had small bathrooms with open showers (not enclosed). We were used to that. We'd been in Turkey for two weeks. This, however, was by far the most awkward set up. The shower was sandwiched so tightly between the wall and the toilet that a large person might actually have to wash with one foot in the john. On top of that, the shower head wouldn't stay fastened in place on the wall, meaning that you have to use one arm to hold the nozzle up while you shower. My husband recommends sitting on the toilet and pouring water over your head. Be careful, though, as the water temperature fluctuates rapidly between scalding hot and ice cold. Our baby had to settle for a sponge bath. Negative experience number two: we were sitting in our room, when we heard a jingling in the lock and the door flew open. Apparently the man who restocks the mini bar (ours did not need restocking) was never informed that it is appropriate to knock before entering other people's hotel rooms. Oh well, that was actually sort of humorous and nothing to get all worked up about. On the other hand . . . Negative experience number three: Okay, here's where it gets ugly. Hotel Agan was our last stop before heading home, and we spent two nights there. We decided that it would be nice to have our laundry done before packing it back into our suitcases and heading home . . . but only if laundry services were affordable (we are students and saved up for an entire year to make this trip). We asked the woman who checked us in about laundry services and she said that the hotel had an arrangement with an outside company who could do our laundry. She couldn't quote an exact price. I asked another hotel employee, a young man, for a rough estimate of the cost. I said, \"Can you give me a general idea of the cost? Is it five lira? Fifty lira.\" He laughed when I said fifty lira and replied, \"No, no, it is very cheap. Maybe three or four lira.\" We had paid between five and ten lira for one load of laundry in the other hotels we had stayed at (some ironed, some didn't, and we didn't care either way). I was surprised to hear that it might be a little cheaper than that in Istanbul, but I figured that even if he was off by a few lira, it was obviously affordable and we should go ahead and have our laundry done. We did. The hotel came back with the bill. SIXTY-FIVE LIRA. That's well over forty U.S. dollars for one load of laundry. We tried expressing polite surprise and dismay. We recounted our earlier conversation with the hotel employee (and were more or less accused of lying). We explained that we'd never paid more than ten lira anywhere else (again, we were accused of lying). The two men we spoke to were discourteous, condescending, and -- I feel -- dishonest. In the end they agreed to let us pay \"just\" fifty lira, which is still an outrageous price by any standards. I take honesty seriously and go out of my way to treat everyone with kindness and respect. It is very rare that I run into people so unwilling to reciprocate. I would never in any circumstances return to Hotel Agan and I strongly encourage other travelers to support businesses that show basic decency and integrity. If my family's experiences are any indication, Hotel Agan is not that kind of business. I'd recommend staying at the Tash Konak (in Sultanahmet) instead. We spent two nights there, as well, and loved it.
