It was a five minute walk to the UCLA extention, which is where my class was located and the location couldn't have been better. There are many dining options in the neighborhood- from swanky to cheep, you have your pick. At first I was disappointed that I was put into the room right next to the front desk; arguably the loudest room in the building, but it turned out to be quite because of an extra pocket door that was installed to create a sound barrier. The room was clean, modern and had all the necessities. This is not the Ritz people- this really is an nice economy choice for people who need the basics at the right price. Parking was free and easy. Maid service was good and efficient. The breakfast was just right- nothing hot, but plenty of cereals, fruit (apples and bannanas) and toast/muffin/pastries to choose from. The internet was spotty, which was probably the most annoying part about the stay.

At first glance the exterior, entrance, and hallways suggest that the rooms would be some kind of typical two or three star accommodation. You know what I mean - that dated 90s cabinetry, funky geometric coloured bedding, and mattresses that you could pretend to surf on. Boy was I surprised. I ended up booking here for a few nights while I sorted out housing for a summer course at UCLA. Previously I had been put up at the neighbouring Claremont hotel, which rings in at about half the price as the Royal Palace. The Claremont was full so I went in search of something nearby that wasn't outrageously priced and here I stayed. For $150 a night I received a room that I would put easily on par with something like a Westin or Sheraton. The room was wonderfully appointed (and I assume recently renovated) with fantastic beds. Wow, wow, wow is all I can say. The bed had a fantastic pillow top mattress, crisp white linens, lots of pillows, and a properly firm boudoir pillow that aided a great deal in bedtime studying. The shower head was a tad low but whatever. That's a minor point next to the importance of a good sleep. The only downside of the stay was the service at the front desk. The staff here ranged from indifferent to downright surly. Perhaps they've had to deal with one too many annoying guests over the year but I certainly didn't do anything to ask for attitude (I hope).

The hotel itself looks very average from the outside, even checking in and seeing the lobby and going down the hallway to our room was also quite average, but once we got to the room it was a WOW. We arrived early and our king room wasn't ready so we got upgraded to a king suite and I have to say this hotel is very similar to many of the Marriott's and Doubletree's I have stayed in with regard to room furnishings, TV's, and room amenities. The kitchenette and bathroom had granite countertops and the bathroom was the roomiest I have ever had in a hotel. The bed was comfortable to the point that I looked under the sheets to see what brand it was in anticipation of my next mattress purchase for my home. We had an incredibly spacious balcony that was at the rear of the building so not much view, but surrounded by trees and very quiet and private. Our trip was divided up into two different stays at the Royal Palace and on our second stay there the following week, our room was equally as nice just not as large as the king suite was. I have to say that the hotel front desk staff seemed mostly indifferent, but the housekeeping staff was very pleasant and did a fabulous job keeping the hotel clean. I usually wear socks in hotel rooms rather than go barefooted, but in this place I was confident enough in the cleanliness to go totally without socks and shoes in the room. This place even smells clean, and that's no small feat for a hotel. The area around Royal Palace is very nice, felt safe, and had plenty of options to shop and eat within walking distance. It is also very close to UCLA. The only real drawback is parking is very tight here, but at least it is free and that's more than many LA hotels have to offer. I was impressed with this very small, unimpressive looking hotel and will definitely stay there on my next trip to LA.

We booked our accommodation via the hotel website directly, & confirmed a place to stay for the duration of our holiday. On our arrival (via rental car), we discovered that the hotel was a fairly smallish complex, close to UCLA, Westwood Medical complex, & many restaurants, cafes, & a few shops.

Basic beakfast is also provided \u2013 muffins, coffee, juice, toast, etc \u2013 fairly standard but fresh & reasonable. The hotel is located fairly near the freeway, & access to many of the Greater Los Angeles sights is very easy.

The night manager, Chris, was very helpful and friendly. He gave excellent advice concerning how to get to the Getty: the bus! The bus stoped 2 blocks away and took a lovely route past Bel Air. He also gave us excellent advice about how to drive to several places in the area. The breakfast was danish, English muffins, toast, 4 kinds of dry cereal, coffee, tea and 2 kinds of juice. The parking wasn't a problem, you just had to leave them your keys if you blocked another car. Very safe, walkable neighborhood.
