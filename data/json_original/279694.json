The pool area is a bit rundown, and has neighbors that are quite loud. Both sides of the pool area had kids in yards that were very loud, and a another bordering property had a very yappy dog.. I understand that the owners, and managers can't control the neighbors..but I think advertising as a \"peaceful\" place is deceptive!

We spent time trying to find a place to stay that would sent a laid-back, calm and relaxing tone for our trip. We found it. Compared to most hotels/motels/B&Bs in the area, these cottages are conveniently located. They are just two blocks from the main street. (Calistoga only has one main street with one red light.) It was a very easy walk to the far end of town. If you need supplies, the grocery is on the corner. Because you are off the main road, the area is quiet and peaceful. The cottages are dated. Built in the 40's. Think 50's ranch house for interior, especially kitchen and bath. This is not a sleak, modern hotel. It's a charming alternatives to the motels and B&Bs in the area. We stayed several days and found the cottage quite comfortable. Our room had a kitchen, bath, bedroom, and a den with couch and TV. Plenty of room. They are very clear that the office will not be staffed overnight and that they routinely walk the property. If the staff has to leave the property for any time, they post this information. They even put a note on our door that they had to leave early due to illness. Honestly, once we checked-in we did not need the staff until check-out. Parking is not adjacent to the cottages but is very close. With rolling luggage, this really wasn't an issue. They do not have phones in the room. They do have wireless internet. Breakfast is delicious - fruit, juice and pastries from a local bakery. The coffee in the room is from the local coffee house and is excellent. Most mornings we took our breakfast outside. They provide outside table and chairs for each cottage. The staff was very helpful. Great resturant and winery recommendations. Even gave us discount coupons. This is the \"sister\" property to Dr. Wilkinson's (best massage in Calistoga) and is an all-adult property. That might have added to the peaceful nature of our stay. Our room was close to the pool. The pool area is lovely. The only complaint we had was that the maintenance shed was next to the pool and the grounds keeper and housekeeping started early - before we wanted to wake up.

Set back from the main street, the cottages are nestled in a residential neighborhood and just a short walk from the town grocery and the Wilkenson spa. Would have liked to take a spa at night past 10 PM but understand the limits, to ensure the quiet enjoyment for all. Other guests were quite nice and engaged in easy conversation. A couple of updates would be nice, new kitchen cabinet/stove, It needs more counter space. A new vanity in the bath would be a nice addition too. They need to add some hooks/towel bars too.
