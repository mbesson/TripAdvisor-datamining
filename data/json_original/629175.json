I enjoyed walking around the Bastakiya area in the evening and happened upon a group of local gentlemen from Majlis Alareesh - Albastakiya and enjoyed a chat with them and a glass of tea. There are a couple of HIndu temples nearby, but are hard to find as they perforce have to be inconspicuous and are small. Am sure they are not enough for the large Hindu population working in Dubai, but all they are allowed. There was also a Sikh Gurdwara and another place within walking distance for Hare Krishna followers. Their day for prayers is Friday, as it is their day off from work.

The building itself is a warren within a maze. Our spacious quarters (Room 6, I think) were cobbled together from three rooms connected by four foot-high doors, booby-trapped with half-steps. Yet, somehow it worked, and we neither stubbed a toe nor bumped our heads. Best was that the hotel owns it own dhow, a comfortable spruced-up 12-metre barge. We got a private dinner and two-hour cruise (just the two of us) on Dubai Creek at sunset. Magic. And at about $125, a bargain. Drawbacks: the free wifi works only in the public areas, parts of which are not air conditioned, and can be unbearably hot. The staff was pleasant and helpful, 24 hours a day.

I was coming out of Afghanistan and seeing my wife for the first time in months, so wanted our first night in Dubai to be special. I researched the heck out of the hotels available and selected the xva based on it's charm and the lovely rooms shown on the website. Further research in lonely planet told me should get room number one. I booked, received my confirmation, and printed it out. Under \"room\" it listed \"room number one.\" So imagine my surprise when we arrived (and wre met by a charming and hard working Filipino steward) and we led to a shabby closet not big enough to turn around in. \"I think ther has been a mistake,\" I said, cheerfully extracting my printed confirmation. \"we are in room number one.\". The poor Filipino guy, looks at the confirmation, says, hmm, yes, so it seems. But unfortunately room number one is more expensive than the rate you paid. \"well, that makes sense,\" i said, \"as I booked online months ago and the rate available then was lower than the rack rate tonight.\" \"Yes, but I cannot give you room number one for that price,\" he said. \"this rate is the small room price.\". I pointed out that my confirmation from the hotel stated clearly, \"room number on, a spacious standard suite.\". In addition to not being room number one, the closet he had shown us to was in no way a suite. Maybe ten square meters. Maybe. My reaction, through gritted teeth, was to tell him to call his supervisor. This guy told me the website made a mistake! I pointed out that the website WAS HIS HOTEL'S OWN WEBSITE. The Filipino guy had me walk through on the HOTEL'S computer how I booked this room for this rate (about a hundred bucks less than the rack rate for room one.) we managed to repeat the results the and then. Let's note that I was at that point exhausted, frustrated, had traveled by helicopter, MRAP, (late) charter aircraft and then taxi for a total of 14 hours. I had totally disappointed my wife, and instead of enjoying be out of a war zone I was arguing with a hotel clerk. The Filipino guy told me that room one was infect empty, but the manager would not let us stay the since we had paid such a low rate. You can imagine how I felt about this. On the phone with the manager, he confirmed that if we paid a charge to top up what we had paid to the rack rate for room one, we could stay there. He said he did not understand why the website had given me that rate for that room, but the price was wrong so I should either pay more money or stay in the closet. It was late so we stayed in the closet. The next morning the manager showed up at the hotel. I told him of my great dissatisfaction and he was thoroughly unconcerned. He said that what i had been accommodated in was a \"standard suite\" and that the term \"suite\" was accurate since xva is a boutique hotel (!). He said that I was never promised room number one, and that the website had assigned that room in error, which was not the HOTEL'S fault. Room one sat empty during our stay. Elegant lobby, nice cafe I guess, but I have never been so rudely stiffed by a hotel in the last 20 years. I am still angry 3 months later and am comforted only by the fact that with this review,I might spare other traveler's my disappointment and victimization. A final point: even if your service experience were far more satisfying, there is no getting around the fact that the xva has one or two showcase rooms that feature prominently in their website, the lonely planet reviews, and the Conde Nast article. The rest of the rooms are tiny and inferior, and, as my experience shows, you have no protection from being shoehorned into one.

There was also a usable mini-fridge, half-filled with snacks & drinks for purchase. Also had a hot pot w/ complimentary coffe & tea.

Located upstairs from an art gallery, in a kind of open air terrace, there are several small guest rooms overlooking the gallery courtyard/cafe. It did feel a bit odd walking into a courtyard art gallery with suitcases, as there is no clear reception, but it's a relief after staying at other soulless chain hotels in the middle east. Don't expect swimming pools, hotel amenities, etc, you come here for the charm and uniqueness of the place. It is right next to what must be the loudest azzan (call to prayer) at 5.00am, so be prepared. Very cool place, and would highly recommend it to people looking for something a little different.", "Date": "February 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sussex", "Title": "\u201cFabulous place\u201d", "Author": "JanetFSussex", "ReviewID": "UR53507379", "Content": "We stayed at this very unusual but lovely hotel in the old town of Dubai. It's very quirky! It is set around 2 courtyards and very Arabic. They have art exhibitions there so it's very interesting. The rooms are very clean but small although we had a little sitting area as well which helps and breakfast is taken in the courtyard.

The room in which we stayed is no where to be found on the website, was anything but chic, the bed was woefully uncomfortable, the decor included a dusty faded bouquet of artificial flowers, fleece blankets used to cover old furniture, an assortment of worn rag throw rugs, and thread bare towels. Was not at all what I had anticipated after such glowing reviews. Am not the kind of person to like to stay in mainstream hotels, but this experience makes them more tempting if just to know what to anticipate.

Those who rated XVA anything under a 4 star obviously don't know how to appreciate quality, art, style and a little bit of something different from the conventional hotel. XVA is anything but your average hotel. The staff are courteous and the service is remarkable! The location, though not situated by the beach is in the historic area of Dubai and provides tourists and businessmen with somewhat of a retreat from the glaring tourism in Dubai. The cost of rooms is well worth the experience or even under priced.. which you will definitely never forget and will want to keep coming back, or never leave! My only complaint would be that the rooms be just slightly larger, but don't get me wrong it does not affect much... The food is exquisite and the owner gorgeous!!

But by no means is this a boutique hotel, there is no reception or hotel staff - once the gallery/ cafe closes at 7pm (or for the weekend) guests are left to themselves. Do not expect the usual hotel amenities. The staff is very charming, but not terribly professional (e.g. we were checking out on a Friday when nobody is on site, so we had to settle our bill during breakfast on Thursday morning, before a first coffee...) The rooms are terribly small (we were in room 3 which according to a plan that was available was 10m2) and presented in charming but very home made style. Bath room is very basic, no shower curtain. The house complex consisting of the gallery, cafe and hotel is impressive and the location is great. However, there is no parking available (we were trying to find a parking space for almost an hour on a Thursday night at 11pm...). I was a bit surprised to find this hotel recommended in both the Luxe Guide and the Wallpaper City Guide - this is definitely not the type of hotel that you would normally expect to find in these guides.
