{"Reviews": [{"Content": "comfortabe 2 stars + hotel I like the hotel for it's price, location and cleanliness. I would say it is three stars, but it is located on the backyards of other houses, and there is no phone in the room. It takes about 30 minutes to get there by U-Bahn from Alexanderplatz, and it is a 3-5 minutes walk from the station (U-Bahn Tierpark). The check in is friendly, but sometimes there is no an English-speaking person, which is actually not a problem. The breakfast is very good, though the official time is from 7am (which is a bit late for Berlin), but coming a bit earlier was not a problem, and we were served perfectly.", "Date": "Oct 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR239524249", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Yigal"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d729373-r10159478-Hotel_am_Tierpark-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "729373", "Price": "$107"}}
