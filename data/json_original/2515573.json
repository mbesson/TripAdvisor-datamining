The elevators frequently took several minutes to make it to the bottom floor; on multiple occasions, I overheard other guests expressing concerns to the front desk staff that the elevators were broken, but no steps were taken to remedy the situation. The parking lot was gated for reasons I couldn't understand; there was nothing really to walk to that might prompt those who weren't guests to park here. The gates were open half of the time, and when they were closed, I did not see one person successfully swipe through with their room key; the front desk had to be paged for assistance every time you wanted to park here. The gym didn't have any sprays to clean the equipment, and the sanitizing wipes they'd provided ran out the first week I was there and were never replaced, making me a little reluctant to use the machinery. This is the first Sheraton I've ever stayed at, and it was not a good recommendation for the chain as a whole.

Check in/desk staff we're all very helpful & friendly and although no free wifi in the rooms, there were two pc's in the lobby for guest use, so that's what I used. This is a conference hotel so there were normally a number of delegates milling about, but nothing to worry us with noise etc. As advised by helpful travelers on here, I asked for a room at the back of the hotel facing the mountain on check in and we were given a room on the 11th floor. As mentioned, the rooms have seen a lot of service and are past there best in some areas, but our room was perfectly serviceable for our needs with a nice 42\" flat screen and clean crisp bed linen. Got free parking on the deal, but noticed that the entry/exit barriers seem to be kept open at nights, so maybe they no longer charge anyone? You need to have a car here as although the hotel is just across the road from a large mall (well a five lane freeway and a couple of dual carriageway's), you can't really walk to any attractions. Guys on the desk offered to run us over to the mall if we didn't want to walk, which was nice, but we took the 15 min walk. The tramline does pick up at the mall though, so you can run round town or down to Tijuana on a $5 daily travel card. Oh yeah, Wendy's, Denny's & another cafe right next to the hotel, so cheap eat options on hand within walking distance, as well as the food court in the mall. Although there are many better locations to stay in San Diego to be in the centre of the action, it offered good value for what it is, an older Sheraton in a non tourist location.

Simply put, do not stay here. My basic requirements for a hotel of clean, quiet, and comfortable went 0 for 3. As a Platinum I was \"upgraded\" to a larger room on the 7th floor. The larger room simply provided more surface area for the lack of cleaning and maintenance. After the room next door started throwing a party (not the hotel's fault) I threw in the towel and went down to the front desk and was moved to a 5th floor room facing the 8. Exact same condition as the first room (and loud), with added bonus of spackle where they've fixed the numerous holes in the wall. Dirty and stained carpets (I wore shoes walking around the room and slept in socks), furniture that wouldn't have been out of place in a dorm room that I wouldn't have sat on in a Tyvek suit, and a disgusting bathroom with shower pressure that can generously be described as \"San Fransisco mist.\" I ended-up rinsing the shampoo out of my hair in the sink. The door to the bathroom doesn't even open because the toilet is in the way. Free parking and internet for being a Platinum as well as Club room access. Unfortunately when they moved my room they didn't recode my key for club access and each trip on the elevator involves about 15 minutes (each direction) because of there only being one elevator in service. When I finally got into the Club lounge I found it to be overcrowded and picked-over so I threw in the towel and ate breakfast in the restaurant. Eggs were cold, but at least I didn't have to fight 50 other people. In the evenings you get to have conversations with the prostitutes hanging in the lobby as you wait, and wait, and wait for the elevator. Gym is a disgrace. I've seen nicer gyms at Hamptons. When I mentioned the fact that the hotel should be condemned at check-out the Front desk cleark said \"oh, we know.

I used the hot tub several mornings and my daughter swam in the pool on one day. The cooler weather kept us out of the pool mostly. The pool area was nice and relaxing, however over by the wall side of the pool there was a steady stream of sugar ants running along the length of the pool. Not really a huge issue to me as I know they are common in warmer climates, but it did kind of freak out a 5 year old girl.

As for its location, we went to the Zoo, Seaworld, and Leogland and every one of these locations were an easy freeway ride to get to. Overall, I highly reccomend this property.

I usually stay anywhere from 4 to 10 nights per stay and am almost always upgraded to the 12th (Club Floor) or 14th floor (2 room suites). A hillside view room is always quieter (even numbered rooms). The hotel is comfortable and the rooms have the Sheraton Sweet Sleeper Beds. Having stayed here on multiple occasions, I have noticed a rather high turnover in staff in the last two years. It seems every time I check-in, there are all new front desk clerks. Everyone is very pleasant, yet overall training could be slightly improved (especially around Sheraton standards). * Addressing recent comments about security: The hotel has NO security cameras and what security at night there exists is very MINIMAL.The 12th & 14th floor USED to be controlled access in the elevator, however two years ago this was stopped and anyone can access these floors - strangely, the doors from the stairwells that access the floors still require a key. I do believe that the hotel does have a security problem (inside and outside), which is why I never leave a laptop, iPad, or similar device in my room when I am not there. Also, make sure the room door clicks shut, some doors don't close on their own. Rooms in general are comfortable, however I believe there needs to be a renovation of soft furnishings, wallpaper, carpeting & drapes. Renovation of the banquet rooms were being done on my most recent visit - nice - but do the guest rooms too ! Club Lounge: As with most domestic Sheratons, this hotel has a lounge the size of two standard guest rooms. The lounge offers a very limited evening service of 1 or 2 appetizers, and a small selection of sodas & water. There is a $3 charge for beer & wine. There is a nice small continental breakfast served from 6:30-9am every day (unfortunately not longer on weekends as with most Sheratons!). The ladies that staff the lounge in the am's & pm's are very sweet and always remember me by name. The lounge itself has never been renovated and is in need of sprucing up. The furniture is too big for a small lounge and provides little area for seated breakfast - especially on weekends. The complimentary parking for Platinum guests is a nice perk not found at other Starwood properties. Of course, Platinum level guests get comp internet access here and at all Starwood Hotels worldwide. I will continue to stay at this property as it is most convenient for me and is a nice Starwood choice if I don't want to be in thedowntown area. One comment for the management is that I don't like being told that things are the way they are because of Remington.

Unfortunately the hotel's TV was faulty and we were not able to watch the game. The excuse was that the satellite reception was dodgy, but we saw the game being aired downstairs in the lobby. Now, it could very well be the case that the lobby has regular cable and the rooms are hooked up to satellite TV. But that seems unlikely. They also proceeded to overcharge us for wireless internet. At checkout, when we mentioned that the lack of TV access was unduly frustrating, we were offered nothing more than a \"I am sorry.\" The hotel is also right next to the highway so it is ridiculously loud. Granted, we knew this when we made our same-day reservation, and we can live with noise, but the windows here might as well have been made of single-ply toilet paper. Regular glass buffers sound slightly (and that would have been acceptable) but this hotel's glass windows defy that convention. The elevators take forever. There are over 10 floors in this building (maybe 20) and only two elevators. The floors are not even equipped with screens indicating the current floor position of the elevator so you are left waiting like a fool in the dark.

I've never had so many issues at one hotel!\u201d", "Author": "ravenchow", "ReviewID": "UR114081487", "Content": "I have stayed at Sheraton Hotels a number of times, as well as this particular hotel a couple of times. So, I looked online at rates on Friday, April 15. I was interested in the breakfast package, but I noticed that my child wouldn\u2019t be included for breakfast. Doubletree had a similar package which cost only $10 more, but it included the children. Also, they have an indoor pool which would be preferable due to the spring season temperatures. I decided to call Sheraton, Mission Valley, since we\u2019ve stayed there before, to see if they could include my child. Not only would they include my child, they would knock $8 off the nightly rate. This was actually making Sheraton about $20 less than Doubletree per night. Since our focus was Sea World and the beach, I decided that Sheraton would work out the best. We had a long 7 hour drive to San Diego due to all the traffic leaving our home city and driving into San Diego. We have an infant so it was a relief to finally pull into the Sheraton property and get out of the car. We checked in at 8 pm. There was no mention of breakfast vouchers and I forgot to ask about them since I was simply relieved that we arrived. This is odd though, since our increased rate actually helps pay for the vouchers so I\u2019m not sure why the check-in clerk would \u201cforget\u201d what we paid. We went out to dinner after settling into our room and returned to the hotel around 10 pm. I stopped at the front desk and spoke to the same gentleman who assigned our room. He looked up the info and said that our package only included 1 breakfast per day. I was confused since the original booking was for 2 breakfasts and I called to see if we could add our child to the package. Now we are receiving less than what I had originally called about? The person on the phone had switched us to a government discount, but that was what he selected when doing the offer over the phone when I explained that I needed our son added into the breakfast package. We argued quite a bit and the gentleman would not change anything. Now, we actually have less than what I originally called about and we already were in our room at 10 at night, when we could\u2019ve been staying at Doubletree. Finally, he said I could use the free Internet service included in my room package and look up my email confirmation. If I could show him confirmation of this arrangement, then he would give us the breakfast vouchers. I printed a copy of my email confirmation and showed him the following typed info in my email, which I have copied and pasted below from the email: FULL BREAKFAST FOR 1 Per Person/per Stay He said that the above message did not mean each person received a breakfast. I explained that in English, the word \u201cper\u201d means \u201ceach\u201d so the above statement actually reads: Full breakfast for 1 each person each stay. It really didn\u2019t matter what I said because he said that we did not get breakfast, other than for 1 person. I was getting angrier and angrier at this point because this was not the arrangement I made when agreeing to book a room on Friday and the printed email confirmation in my hand meant absolutely nothing. We could\u2019ve been at the Doubletree for $10 more ($18 more after this supposed discount) and been swimming in an indoor pool that evening. I told him that he needed to get a manger that could see to this arrangement that I paid for on Friday. He stated that he was the manager. I started raising my voice pretty loudly and other customers were in the lobby off and on during this long, heated exchange. I assumed because I got so loud, he finally gave me the vouchers for all 3 nights for the 3 people in my family. I was seething by the time I headed upstairs to our room. This would be our last stay at any Sheraton Hotel. Never again. We thought there was a hot breakfast buffet like the Sheraton in Anaheim, but the next morning, we discovered there were only some discount store pastries and cereal boxes available. I had asked during the reservation if this breakfast arrangement was the hot buffet we were accustomed to in Anaheim. We apparently weren\u2019t the only confused customers because as we sat there, a few other families entered, looking for the buffet. The vouchers stated that we could order off the menu, so we did. The service was poor & there were hardly any customers in the restaurant. I wasn\u2019t surprised. This entire breakfast experience actually made us laugh about the fact we were so angry about leaving out our breakfasts entirely when we checked-in to the hotel. McDonald\u2019s would\u2019ve been a better experience. I took a shower after breakfast and our smoke alarm went off and would not shut off. Apparently the steam (no ventilation system in the bathroom) sets off the smoke alarm outside the bathroom door. My husband looked outside in the hallway because we actually thought the hotel was on fire. There were a couple of housekeepers & another employee on a cell phone. My husband thought they were calling someone because apparently, it was only our room with the problem. I stopped my shower and the smoke alarm shut off. No one ever came to our room to question this problem. Very odd. You\u2019d think an employee might want to investigate. This happened again later and a maintenance worker showed up and removed our smoke alarm. That can\u2019t possibly be legal. I gave him permission to do it though because the smoke alarm was a huge nuisance. Who wants to listen to a piercing smoke alarm every time they take a shower? The first night we noticed a Going Green flyer in our room. If we declined housekeeping services, we would receive a $5 voucher from \u201cparticipating vendors\u201d for each day we declined services. We thought this might be a nice way to get some lunch money for the day we left. We had to hope that a good restaurant would be on the list. On Monday, we didn\u2019t receive a voucher, but we received one on Tuesday. It turns out that the participating vendors were actually the restaurants INSIDE Sheraton. Well, that was silly. A bagel cost $5 so our decision to decline housekeeping services was a very poor one. The flyer didn\u2019t indicate it was restaurants on the property. My husband decided to ask a gentleman at the front desk if the snack room allowed the use of these vouchers. He said that yes, we could use the vouchers there. That was fine then because we could get some snacks on our day of check-out. On Wednesday, we expected to get our Tuesday voucher since we declined services Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday, the only thing we received was our bill, no second voucher. Great. Now I have to call and complain about yet another issue on our final day. I called and that issue was handled surprisingly well. The woman on the phone said she would send the missing voucher up to our room immediately. She did. Wednesday morning we went to check out. We let our son pick out $10 in snacks from the snack room, which didn\u2019t take long since a 30 cent candy bar was priced at $2 and a $2 bag of chips was actually $4. We went to the counter to hand in our key card and use our vouchers. The woman said that we couldn\u2019t use the vouchers in the snack room. We explained that just yesterday, someone had told us we could use them there. She apologized for the misinformation and wouldn\u2019t allow us to use the vouchers. At this point, I was FINISHED with Sheraton Hotel. We were on our way out of town and I\u2019d had it with the horrendous service at this hotel. With customers standing nearby, I told her that we\u2019d no longer be staying at any Sheraton and there was no misinformation. It was all blatant lies. We were lied to about our reservation and lied to about the vouchers declining housekeeping services. We needed to redeem these vouchers and leave the property. She told us to take the items and leave. We did. I wrote a complaint to Sheraton. I received an email response from management at this property, offering us 7,000 points. I had no idea what that meant & that's tacky to offer something that most customers would be unfamiliar with. I emailed & learned that 7,000 points were equal to 1 free night. I'm not sure why this wasn't the offer given. Plus, 3 horrendous nights that we paid for cannot be made up with one free night.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guadalajara, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cLike my home\u201d", "Author": "LAG59", "ReviewID": "UR112961504", "Content": "Great hotel!

Our goal was to rent a car and tour the city throughout the trip, hitting all the hot spots, spending little time in a resort / hotel. I picked this hotel mainly for it's location and price. It's an older hotel with some outdated bathrooms / plumbing, but certainly was perfect location wise. It's right off route 8, making it within 15 minutes to almost any location you'd want to visit around the San Diego area. The parking is free and right in front of the main entrance, and with the help of our GPS, the drives were easy and quick. The front desk and staff were polite and responsive. The rooms were not amazing, but sufficient (new flat screen TVs were nice). The pool was nice and quiet for a few hours of reading after a long day. The one negative that people seem to hit on is the noise because of close location from the highway (basically a stones throw away from our window). We stayed on the side of the hotel with a view of the highway so this was an issue for us, but not something so loud you couldn't sleep. My wife and I have lived in different cities along the east coast for the past 6 years so are not terribly bothered by city / car noise. The reason for the noise (in my opinion) is outdated windows with poor insulation. The hotel could solve this issue relatively quickly with improved insulation on the current windows, or for a permanent solution (however expensive) with completely new windows. Overall, we were quite happy with our stay, for the price and location it was perfect (we used a third party for our reservation and got an excellent deal).", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cTypical Corporate America - unpleasant\u201d", "Author": "dolldetails", "ReviewID": "UR107606496", "Content": "We rented this room to watch the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Catherine at 3am in the morning and not disturb our household.

I followed the link on the Rodeo site which went to Starwoodmeetings and booked through there. My confirmation email included a link to upgrade to a club room for only $40 a night, I followed the link and it listed the benefits of the Club upgrade being \"Don't miss this exclusive opportunity to upgrade your room to experience our Club Level Rooms for $40 per night. Our Club Level Rooms gives you access to our Club Lounge and fitness center. Our Club rooms also include a free bottle o water and upgraded amenities. For those who like a little extra room for families or for buisness upgrade your room to an amazing Suite for $100 per night.

Club Lounge includes: complimentary breakfast, afternoon hors d\u2019oeuvres, a variety of beverage options and copier/fax/printer.\" Well the catch is that the club lounge is only open for breakfast Monday - Friday, and hors d'oeuvres Sunday to Thursday. which is not listed in any of the communications or links I was sent from Starwood and the hotel. It is mentioned on the Features & Activities page of the hotel website. But I was not told of this when I booked or when I checked in. I contacted the front desk and was told the Club lounge was not open on weekends, but that I was still entitled to the other benefits of free internet, car parking and the bottle (single) of water in my room. I contacted SPG chat and after a lengthy online chat with Amy was told pretty much the same thing, sorry but there is nothing we are going to do or offer you, its listed on the website. The hotel is fine room wise, good bed, a little dated decor, room compendium stained and damaged pages, good Air Conditioning, happy looking staff, but I think for the money I could have got a better deal at the other hotels down the road which were including a full breakfast with the room rate. I was not satisfied with the response I received from the initial contact with hotel staff or from SPG online Chat, I believe their upgrade information is misleading and they kept trying to pass the blame. While writing this review I received a call from Lucy at the front desk apologising and sending me up vouchers for Continental Breakfast which is all I really wanted in the first place, but I had to jump through hoops to get to this point and spend an hour and a half of my time dealing with it. There are promotions everywhere saying \"Rediscover Sheraton\" well Sheraton needs to rediscover its guests and its communications to ensure that all information is clear and concise and clearly stated. In the old days (10 yrs ago) every effort would be made to resolve an issue and associates were empowered to take the initiative and ask the guest what they wanted for the problem to be solved. On my experience this time no one asked me what it would take to make me a happy and satisfied guest, they pointed me to the web page and said its there to read that lounge is closed. They did not put themselves into my shoes to see how I was feeling and I don't think realised that a tiny little thing like a continental breakfast would impact on view and opinion of the Sheraton and Starwood brands. I now have a breakfast voucher, but I had to fight for it and spend time that will never be recovered.

However, we did get lost trying to get to the otherside of the highway for a shopping day at Fashion Valley. Sheraton are well branded hotel and very spacious. Our room overlooked the back so we didn't hear any sounds from the highway. Beds are very comfortable and the flat screen television was larger than most hotels. The only negative thing about this hotel was the parking situation. They do charge for parking in the front, however the gates were always up so you really didn't need access for parking. After the wedding we parked on the side, which needed more light at night. However, the side entrance to the hotel made it safe to walk from your car to the hotel. The location of the hotel is great if you love to shop and go into downtown San Diego with direct access near the major highways. Since Fashion Valley Mall is literally across the highway, there are alot of places to eat at the mall and the surrounding shopping center on Camino Del Rio N. Based on the price, service, location, and comfortable bed, I would recommend this hotel for both business and leisure travelers in San Diego.

The first two trips were very nice and I enjoyed the hotel, room, food selection and the staff. This trip was different. The room I was assigned to had a very small bathroom - the vanity was upgraded but the toilet and tub were old. The toilet lever broke twice during my three day stay. Once, I called maintenance, and the second time, I fixed it myself. The roomed seemed clean, the linens were new and the bed was comfortable. I liked the larger TV and the desk area. I did have to pay $9.95 for daily internet. The air conditioning system turned on and off frequently, which would not have been bad, other than the loud band and crackle that accompanied the action, enough so that I needed earplugs to sleep. The nice concierge/doorman was gone and the front desk staff seemed new and overwhelmed, with no clear answers for the simplest of questions. For example, one evening, the hotel elevators were not working for at least 45 minutes. They could not direct us to service elevators, or stairs. They ran low on small bills and would not give change, so I was not able to leave a tip for housekeeping on my last day (even the restaurant could not give change). I called the front desk to request a taxi and a Towncar showed up instead, with a flat fee fully ten dollars over what a taxi cost to arrive from the airport. This is called rogue-cabbing and is against city and convention bureau policies, but I'm sure the front desk is getting kick-backs from this car service. The restaurant was understaffed and they directed me to table with no menu,silverware or beverage for ten minutes. On the plus side, the food was good when it arrived. Leaving the worst impression is my experience after I departed. I found a $4 charge on my CC. I have contacted the hotel over ten times by phone, fax and email for the last two weeks and they have not resolved the matter, nor I have I even received a reply back. On three occasions, I actually have been disconnected by the front desk instead of being transferred to the accounting department or general manager. Twice, I have talked to someone who promised a receipt within the hour, to no avail and I have never actually received a callback, fax or email in response. I left a voicemail detailing my dilemma for Susan Stevens, the general manager, and have not received a response. All this over a $4 charge, but it is blocking my entire expense report, so it is important. In this economy, what hotel can possily survive with this lack of customer service?

After calling engineering to tell them there was a problem, he told us thats just how they work. The room was dark and looked over the motel syle pool. The TV remote did not work. The comforter was stained. It was just one thing after another... We got ready and called the front desk for a cab to get to the event. Knowing that it was only a 3 minute cab ride across the freeway, we called down about 10 minutes before we needed to leave. Our frustration only grew when we were told it would be 20 minutes for a cab. After waiting 25 minutes, now missing the opening speeches of the event, a town car arrives and asks us if we called for a cab. We had waiting all that time because the girl at the front desk called a town car? He claimed to be a taxi but it was certainly a towncar service and I am positive the agent make some sort of commission. $15 dollars later for a 1.5 mile ride across the freeway I had had it. I paid a very cheap rate but even if the room were less than $100, I would not stay there. It is dirty, secluded, and has poor service.

The hotel is easily seen from the freeway, but it was difficult to find the driveway since there's only a small sign and some hedges and cars on the side of the road. Parking is just an open self-park lot with no covered spaces. Some of the spaces were very narrow. Check-in was efficient and the staff were very nice. The decor is dark wood/formal classic style. There's a small gift/convenient shop, but no clerk - you pickup what you want and pay at the reception/check-in desk. There's a restaurant on site (didn't try it) and a reasonable pool. There's also a \"club level\" for the nightclub crowd. On the weekend it was pretty busy between club rats and what appeared to be a wedding party/family reunion.

There's standard fast food and coffee shops on the hotel side of the freeway. If you want chain restaurants or other local fare you have to brave the shopping center traffic. Because of the layout of the off/on ramps and turn lanes, it was very difficult to determine what lane you were supposed to be in until you were right at the intersection. Unfortunately, due to the layout of the streets its not easy to walk from the hotel to the shopping centers. That was my biggest complaint: the surrounding traffic during the weekend.

Also, we had to call housekeeping three times - once the toilet wasn't working, once there was no hairdryer in the room, and once to have the batteries in the remote control replaced. That's a lot of calls to housekeeping for a two-night stay. I don't want to put anyone off from this hotel, because the odds are you would have a nice stay.
