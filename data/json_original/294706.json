Great value, clean rooms and very friendly staff. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to our friends! This is in no way a negative comment but our only comment would be that you need to leave one ID (drivers license) during your entire stay and also your room key each time you leave. We are used to taking our key with us but it is really safe and there is someone always at the front desk. Also, be sure to bring toiletries (shampoo, conditioner and soap). We took the ADO bus from Cancun Airport ($10 pp each way). When you get off the bus exit to Ave 5 then turn left and walk down to 4th. The hotel is a block and a half away from the beach, Ave 5 shopping/dining, and two blocks from the Cozumel ferry. If you are going to Xelha, you can also take the ADO bus and it will drop you off right in front. The first bus leaves at 8:30 am and you get there around 9:15 am. There are two buses back to Playa - one at 5:40 and one at 5:55 pm. It is about $9 USD round trip with ADO. It is way cheaper than a taxi and my husband didn't really want the hassle of finding a collectivo. I would also recommend booking your Chichen Itza tour with the front desk.

The room was very basic and clean. There is no tv and only a couple shelves to put your clothes. There was a small fridge in the room, but it made a lot of noise. The room I had was kind of noisey because of a bar that is a next door but I closed the shutters on the window and it wasn't too bad. The breakfast is a bun/croissant or cereal, juice and coffee/tea. The hotel is very secure and you hand in your key when you leave the hotel. They have free international calls with the help of the receptionist, which was really a nice perk. I booked on Expedia on late notice for $70/night and I think it was worth about $45/night (USD). Air conditioning and a safe was an extra $9USD. The pictures are accurate to what the room looks like.

From there, ask a worker for directions; it is a 10 minute walk to the hotel. I looked at a lot of other hotels that were twice the price, although located in the same district. Barrio Latino is in the heart of the tourist centre, and there are always places to go and places to eat. I would recommend El Fogon for their pastor!! ROOM: Comfortable, quaint with a hammock outside, and clean! Don't expect anything fancy, however, this hotel meets all your needs without having a TV or pool. I have to add that we did have tiny ants overtop the headboard in our room; this didn't bother us much, since having geckos and bugs aplenty is pretty standard in tropical countries (I stayed at a 5* resort that had some of these guys around too - - - so don't be surprised). Simply stow sweet candy in your luggage, and you'll be fine... I found that they got into a ziplock bag of Smarties! BREAKFAST: Standard continental fare - coffee or juice, with either cornflakes or pastry. The coffee is really good! If you are a healthy-eater, you can easily find something on 5th Ave. SERVICE/FOOD: Service was always prompt and courteous. I stayed in a Non-AC room, but this didn't matter much.... If your kids don't mind not having a TV or pool, I think you can easily bring children to this hotel... As for noise - our room did have background chatter from another establishment at night, however, we had earplugs, so this was inconsequential. You have to walk through the main office which is always manned, so it is safe and secure. There is no in-room safe or bottled water in the rooms.

We booked the first two nights before we went online just in case we didn't like it, but we signed up for the rest of our trip after our first day. This, in fact, turns out to be the best way to do it as they charge a significantly lower rate in person than they can when you book online. Probably the best advice unless you're at the very peak of high season (and are therefore worried about finding accommodations) is to just reserve the first night online ahead of time and then add the rest after that - we saved about 30% doing it this way (~$70 online and ~$55 in person). It's perfectly located if you ask me - 1 minute from 5th Avenue and the beach beyond but far enough so that you aren't kept awake too much by the noise in those places. Anyway, the place was spotlessly cleaned every day. The rooms were not huge, but the bed was - king sized and comfy. The AC was much appreciated after the intensity of the tropical heat. Lockable safe in the room. Gorgeous inner courtyard - tropical trees and a grass-thatched palapa in the middle. Free WiFi was also a big bonus. On the slightly down side, there was sometimes a bit of a smell from the drains that wasn't awesome but which also wasn't hard to quickly forget about, and the continental breakfast was not really worth attending - the coffee was garbage and the buns were uninspiring. After the first two days, we just got our breakfast elsewhere. One of the best parts was the super reliable, always approachable, very knowledgeable front desk guy, Marco. He helped us so much over our stay, from understanding how to catch buses and collectivo taxis, to finding places to eat, and sorting out other issues.

Rooms were cleaned every day and although the rooms were basic it did have a fridge which was nice. The location of this hotel is a few blocks north of the busy 5th avenue so it was quiet at night and the restaurants near this hotel seemed to be less 'touristy' and more authentic and cheaper. Only bummer about the room was the beds, pretty stiff springs but still slept pretty good each night. The continental breakfast in the morning was basic (cereal/crossiants) but really good (the guava juice and coffee were excellent!). The courtyard/garden area was also a very nice space. Overall for the price we were happy with our hotel choice. I don't think we will be back to Playa as it was definately more expensive than Puerto Vallarta.

I had a room on the second level above the office that was somewhat smaller and lacked the individual terrace area or the hammock that other rooms had. But because of more natural light and privacy it provided, I began to prefer it immediately. It rained on my first night, and I was awakened to a leaky roof. Although it was fixed the next day (I was told), I was offered another room downstairs that looked bigger and newer. But by then, my little room seemed like the most perfect one for me, so I opted to stay. I liked having a view of the street instead of facing the courtyard. I could sit in the hammock chair for hours, alternating between surfing the web (free wifi), reading a book, and watching people on the street below, all in relative seclusion. The beds had nice new mattresses with good linen. I also appreciated the extremely quiet ceiling fan. The hotel & the room were generally quiet. The bathroom could be a potential problem area for some. The tiles in the shower were getting old & chipped, and some could seem mildewy. The sink pipe leaked a bit, too.

The beds are comfortable, the showers are warm, the AC and and fan worked perfectly - also (and importantly in my opinion) the rooms and bathrooms were very clean. The hotel isn't on the main drag; which is a bit of a plus in my opinion as another hotel I stayed in (Hotel Labnah - avoid like the plague!!) was very noisy until late at night because of neighbouring clubs... Barrio Latino is very quite and peaceful. The rooms look out onto a small courtyard, which is nicely maintained, but as mentioned the rooms don't get all that much natural light - but to be honest, you're in Mexico - get out of you room and go and see something!! :) The breakfast could be better; the food is nice but a little sparse - you can buy extra items at a small charge; but I think more should be provided as standard. All in all I'd easily recommend this hotel - on my 2nd visit to Playa Del Carmen (we were on a round-trip) we stayed at hotel Labnah which was absolutely awful; so we checked out and tried to get back into the Barrio Latino which was unfortunately full... the guys were helpful and recommended us to try the Hotel Casa de las Flores, which was really, really nice (although a little walk from town)...

Parking was very difficult to find downown , so that the hotel in front of the Barrio Latino was charging 5 dlls a night. Barrio latino had very good rates and the parking for free, so that was a great deal to me, adding the use of the safe in the room, a very well working air conditioner, and the hammock outside my room which I could enjoy a lot when not working. Because of a very low season in a difficult year, most of the hotels downtown I could visit, or I could walk close, were empty, but the Barrio Latino was almost full every night of the week I spent there. People came and left, and I could notice they were from countres like Us, Canada, Australia, Mexico, adding several europeans from Italy, France and me with my group from Malta. It was nice to have short talks with them. While I was there, the signal was getting even better, because of a new router and several point to point antenna they were trying to install. Overall, I think Barrio Latino is the best choice for people like us who go for Business in the Mayan Riviera to visit clients of the tourism market, because of the location, the great service, and the unbeatable prices.

The hotel itself is very charming and full of personality. I had read reviews about people in love with the shady courtyard and the individual hammocks outside of each room. While I didn't end up having time for my hammock, it was lovely to know it was there waiting for me. The room was cute and quiet and did the trick. The toilet in my room was a little tricky, but definitely not something that would prevent me from staying at this hotel again. The hand-painted walls and accents are nice touches, and it really fits the quaint feeling of Playa del Carmen. There are also two cocker spaniels who permanently live at the hotel. I'm a dog person, so I absolutely adored having them running around. If I had to complain about something, it would be that the staff was a bit more knowledgeable. The two young people who generally ran the front desk didn't have many recommendations. A small part of it may have been a language barrier since I speak very little Spanish, but it would have been nice if they could have been a little more helpful on that front. I believe I did talk to the owner and his wife at breakfast on a few occasions, and they actually had very good recommendations and always seemed excited and willing to help. I think I would have moved into the hotel if the two of them could be around all of the time. The breakfast wasn't the most exciting breakfast I've ever had, but for the price of the hotel I definitely didn't mind venturing out a few mornings for a bigger, more substantial breakfast. I would definitely recommend this hotel especially over the big, showy resorts. It's about two blocks away from the beach, so it's close enough to the action to be convenient but far enough away to be quiet and relaxing.", "Date": "May 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "rubbishystuff", "ReviewID": "UR28267892", "Content": "Clean, cozy rooms.

Management were extremely accomodating. We originaly booked the Carribean Room with the palapa roof and found this room to be too small for two people and fairly dark. Luckily they had space available and for the best price difference, we had to pay $10US per night for one of the Standard Rooms. This change made a big difference in our overall enjoyment of the hotel and Playa. The Carribean Room only has small windows on one side, and the bathroom was quite small too. The standard rooms were considerably larger, have windows on both sides of the room which allows a cross breeze into the room, with a larger bed and bathroom. As well as a larger a/c unit (which may or may not work, we didn't care, because we prefer a ceiling fan, which worked well). Overall, the hotel is clean, and so was our room. Security seemed top notch, with the front gate always closed. And locked after 11pm. The in room safe boxes are large enough for most traveler valuables however it did not fit our laptop with 16\" screen. Some additional towels and a bathmat would have been welcome additions but were not crucial. The free parking was great and secure, however, there is only room for about 5 vehicles and its a first come first serve, but I think you can park on the street for free and staff can watch it too. Parking was full on our last night but not on any of the others. We asked for a quiet room and were given the second from the end, But almost any of the rooms except the three nearest the street are most relaxing, with only the very distant sound of this vibrant city sounding in the night. Yes there is a bit of a pong from the drains in the washrooms, and they do request you do not put any paper down the loo, but this is normal in a lot of countries, and is actually better for the environment, we should all be putting our paper in the bio waste. Neither are that bad. There is a laundry right across the street so you can pack light and get your clothes cleaned at the service while at the beach. It rained hard one evening so we went to the Casa Tucan across the street for dinner and it was one of our best value meals in Playa. To sum it up, clean, quiet, nicely decorated, acceptable breakfast, ncie dogs, pleasant staff, secure and great value. We thank everyone at the Hotel Barrio Latino for making our vacation most enjoyable.", "Date": "February 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA haven of peace in Playa\u201d", "Author": "SLPTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR24596907", "Content": "My husband and I had booked a private room in a hostel for the last 2 nights of our trip to stay in Playa.

We found Barrio Latino and checked in. One night at 650 pesos, king size bed, available immediately, free breakfast, private bath with good shower, and a ceiling fan AND a/c (a real plus since my husband hates a/c). The staff was friendly, the dogs were adorable, and the hammock on the balcony was perfect. I had to give my drivers license over, pay in advance, leave the key everytime we left, and let the staff check the room before checkout, which are not unreasonable policies but were a bit surprising. The room was spotless, the bed was comfortable, the noise was reasonable, and the breakfast was more than adequate. I highly recommend this hotel, especially with the great location just close enough to the beach and 5th avenue but near enough to the \"real\" town to get the local flavor and eat at local places.

The staff was exceptionally nice and for the price... (43 US dollars) we could not complain. The hotel had all the ear-markings of being remodeled, and presented with fairly nice shabby chic decor. We viewed our room before agreeing to stay and found it to be average at best, but satisfactory for one night. However, staying in this room (#22) proved to test all patience. Our toilet barely flushed (three try minimum) and it came with a sign posted on the wall to dispose all toilet paper into a waste basket instead. When we ran the sink faucet to brush our teeth, we were greeted with the smell of sewage. The musty, rotting smell of the bathroom was so strong that opening the door in the morning took stamina and nose plugging! All we really wanted was a one-night stay in a quiet hotel where we could wash away all our dirt from traveling on our last night in Mexico. This was definitely not the place for this! We also did not have enough towels, and could not use our AC due to the rattling noise it made when turned on. We had to close most windows to keep out the street noise from surrounding hotels as well as noisy guests on the first floor, and our shower continuously dripped and leaked even when turned off. The few pros to this hotel were two helpful, pleasant desk clerks that spoke English, a location only a few blocks off Avendia 5, and our king bed was surprisingly soft and comfortable, and not a typical hard Mexican hotel bed. Also, part of our disappointment stems from disliking Playa del Carmen in general. I have no idea why people chose to visit such a cheap, crowded, dirty tourist trap at all when there are much more beautiful places to see along the Riviera Maya! I suppose there are much worse places to stay in Playa, and for the price Hotel Barrio is probably one of the better options- but although I loved the Riveria Maya, I have no plans to waste time in this city or stay at this hotel again in my lifetime.", "Date": "December 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cUnderstanding management\u201d", "Author": "Jocky603", "ReviewID": "UR22418138", "Content": "We booked this hotel in Playa del Carmen as we really liked the website, location and price.
