Check in was acceptable. I wanted a double bed, but they only had two singles. Seems like they don't have very many rooms with double beds to begin with so you really have to check with them to make sure you get it. They apologized and upgraded me to a sea view room instead. The room was nice. Bathrooms very clean. Would have hoped for a bathtub but those are quite rare in Hong Kong. The room had what seems like taller ceilings. The sea view also faces the park behind the hotel instead of the road in front. That said, not much of a see view left with so many taller buildings in the way. Bed was a touch hard, but that's pretty typical of Asia. The AC is powerful enough but it turns off when you take your keycard out of the slot. Ripping the cardboard sleeve they give you for the keycards and stuff it into the slot does keep it running. Room has a basic safe, but its bolted to a cabinet, not the wall (sorta iffy). The elevators are awful. Simply awful. They were working on them during my stay so they had 3 instead of 4 running (one of which ran on it's own with separate buttons). Normally, it should be fine, but the elevator controller is pretty idiotic. Hopefully it'll improve once the work is done. Oh and the 25th doesn't have elevator service, you walk a flight of stairs from 24. The crummy elevators is really the only thing keeping me from giving this hotel a 5 star rating. Location is good. Close to MTR Jordan Station and Austin Station. There are busses on the main road, but don't bother, the MTR is usually much quicker.

One elevator was completely down as it was being repaired, so that left three working elevators. While we were there, over the course of three days, two of the three remaining elevators constantly broke down. At one point, we were carted up to our rooms on the 15th floor using the service elevator. We were told that the two broken elevators were under emergency repair and would be up and running soon. Later that day, we tried to leave our rooms on the 15th floor. Just like before, only one elevator was running. The one working elevator constantly went to the 25th floor and proceeded downward picking up passengers till the bottom. Unfortunately, being on the 15th floor, we could not get on since the one working elevator was always full by the time it got to us. After waiting for over ten minutes, we decided to take the fire stairs down fifteen floors. To our surprise and horror, the bottom eight floors were locked. Even worse, the last few floors were completely unlit. We eventually made our way out of the death trap on the 11th floor and got downstairs using a different set of elevators that only go up to the 13th floor. When we presented our dissatisfaction with the elevator and emergency exit problems to a manager, he focused on the elevator issue being fixed soon. We tried to explain the hazard of the stairs leading to unlit and locked lower levels. The manager maintained that the last level is unlocked (it's not, we checked), but failed to understand the problems with having an unlit stairway and locked emergency exit doors. In my opinion, the B P International is a dangerous place to stay. As for the rest of my experience, it was average. The front desk didn't seem to care much for the issues we presented and were not very helpful. On the other hand, the concierge and information desk was much more helpful. The large lobby is very inviting and kept very clean. Our rooms were pretty small; however, the size of the room didn't bother me. I agree with other reviewers that the location of the hotel is nice.

I booked a Harbour view room in February requesting a non-smoking room with a queen bed, arriving on May 7 for 4 days. Three weeks prior to arrival, I emailed the hotel confirming my booking, once again requesting that a non-smoking, queen bed room be put aside for me. The hotel thanked me for my email and \"noted\" my request. We arrived in Hong Kong on an early flight from Europe, but there was no room available as yet (no problem with this, we were very early). Nevertheless, the girl said she would check us in so all I would have to do later was collect me key. Once again, I reminded here of my request of a non-smoking, queen bed room. She said it would be no problem. On our return later in the afternoon, to my amazament I was told by a different check in person that my room with TWIN beds was ready! I explained that on three separate occasions, I requested a non-smoking, queen bed room. He said that there was none available and that there were only six such rooms in the whole hotel (this hotel has about 500 rooms!). After a lengthy heated argument, I had to settle for a smoking, queen bed room. So after booking three months earlier, reconfirming my request by email three weeks before arrival and being told that very morning that everything was ok, the hotel still couldn't deliver.

Believe those and this. It is truly bad. I had been given a room on the 24th floor, harbor-view, and while the view was pleasant, going in and out of the hotel was anything but that. There was a total of three working lifts servicing B, G, UG, 11 - 24 storeys. They don't work well.

Whined to a cleaner who revealed that the lift situation has been like this for more than six months, that even she could not stand it at times. So what's happening B P? Pluses: - great location - step out of the hotel, turn left and walk a few steps) (okay maybe for five minutes) and you will hit Austin Station. Better yet, turn right from the hotel, walk towards Parkes Street and you will hit Jordan Station. - great food With Temple Street nearby and the plethora of seafood (giant praying mantis prawns, crabs, shellfish etc), and so many tea houses nearby - you won't go hungry. - great service Staff was nice - lady checking me in was nursing a very bad flu and had a mask on but went out of her way to recommend a respectable foot reflexology place to help with the aching feet. Awesome. - great price, sorta It's not ex for a hotel like this - but surely you can give more than one tiny bottle of shampoo and soap for two people?

Tsim Tsa Shui (TTS) is about 20 mins walk. If you do not feel like walking, then just hop on the Jordan MTR to TTS. The hotel room is big compared to other hotels. The staff from the housekeeping department are super friendly. There are 2 negative things about this Hotel. Firstly, I find that the staff manning the reception are not helpful or friendly. They have this \"air of arrogance\" in them and it seems that they only treat guests who can speak in Cantonese well. Their English is mediocre and they have a tendency to speak fast. They would not volunteer any information but rather acted very aloof. Secondly, the elevators in this Hotel seems to be specially made for a remote little village and not for a mega fast paced city like Hong Kong. The elevators take ages for any guests to ride. From the many reviews in Tripadvisor, I believed this is the main complaint. People in Hong Kong tends to walk fast, eat fast and talk super fast and yet this elevator is superbly slow..... P.S: For those who want to go to the airport or going to the Hotel from the airport, you can travel via the Airport Express. The costs is HK$90 per person. but if you buy the tickets in a group of 2 or more, then you'll save more than HK$20 per pax. From the airport, take the Airport Express and stop in Kowloon station.

For some reason, in a massive hotel, one elevator is always out of order, and you have to press two buttons to call the other 3 elevators.

My first impression of the hotel was decent enough. The lobby is nice and, while small, the rooms were clean. There was nothing particularly fancy or luxurious about the room itself, but it met our needs just fine and had a nice, strong shower. However, service at the hotel was markedly lacking - even by Hong Kong standards. Our problems started at check in, when my wife and I were told that only twin sized beds were available, rather than the queen sized bed we would have preferred. When I asked if we could at least switch rooms later during our stay, we were basically unapologetically told no. This was not the end of the world, but a simple smile or apology would have helped go a long way. The next day, it was raining quite a bit and we had dinner reservations. We asked at the bellstand if we could get a taxi. We were told, \"No problem. You can hail one outside.\" But there were none outside. So, we were left to stand in the rain on the sidewalk to hail a taxi on our own. This took about ten minutes, and we were about ten minutes late for our reservation accordingly. Again, this wasn't horrible. But a little bit of help would have been nice. The following day, we checked out. Check out was efficient enough and easy, despite a long line. We opted to take \"their\" shuttle to the airport to catch our flight. At 110 HKD per person, this was barely any cheaper for the two of us than a taxi would have been. But we figured it would be easy and reliable (see above about catching a taxi). When I asked how the shuttle works, I was handed a list of times with no actual instructions, information, speaking-to, or even eye contact. So we chose a shuttle that gave us a little cushion on time on our own. We left our bags at the hotel and were told to be back at 19:30 to catch our bus. We were back at 19:15. At 19:45 (our shuttle's scheduled time), there was neither a shuttle nor mention of a shuttle. We inquired at the bell desk, and we were told that the shuttle would arrive any minute, and the bellboy would let us know when it was there. No problem; we continued to wait. At 20:00, my wife again asked the bellboy where our shuttle was. She was told that he had \"just spoken\" to them (maybe the driver? who knows...), who was five minutes away. Of note, we had been watching this bellboy moving bags around for the preceding 45 minutes, and at no point was he near to or speaking on a phone. So we asked if he'd mind calling and checking with the driver again, as we needed to catch our flight. We were still being polite, I should add. However, at this point, the bell staff literally turned his back on us and walked away, completely ignoring us. I can tolerate a degree of subpar service, but blatant rudeness to your customers crosses a line for me. As we had been ignored, we asked again (admittedly, somewhat less politely this time) and were told, extremely rudely, to \"just wait a few minutes\" as, again, he turned around and walked away from us. The bus did, in fact, come a few minutes later. Overall, it was about 20 minutes late. Luckily, we had given ourselves a big time cushion, so 20 minutes wasn't the end of the world. But the complete lack of basic communication or professionalism by the hotel staff was inexcusable to us. Additionally, as a note, if you take \"their\" shuttle (as it's advertised), give additional extra time, as this is a shuttle that stops at multiple Kowloon hotels. Again, not necessarily a big deal had we known, although, when we asked for details about the shuttle, this information (and, in fact, all information) was not given to us. The hotel does boast a good location, adjacent to Kowloon Park, and nearby to a lot of good food and shopping. It also boasts a clean, though not fancy room, at an affordable rate.

We did not have free wifi as some have noted, but a computer near the bar was made available to us. There is a happy hour every day for those who enjoy a 2 for 1 drink. The one negative was the wonky elevator service. Friends we were travelling with were on a floor where the elevators did not want to stop, and ended up having to walk down at one point. We watched elevators go past our floor on more than one occasion. I did create a sense of unease when we eventually got in, wondering if we could get out! Apparently upgrades are about to occur. Good. The price for this hotel was reasonable, and we would recommend it to other travellers.

It is cheaper compared to other hotels in Hongkong but with so much to offer. Check-In: check in was fast, plus we had free complimentary drinks. The receptionist attended to us well. In case of early check in and your room is not yet available, like ours, you have the option to leave your luggages at the reception so you can start touring hongkong. Not to worry since they do have an organized system so as to take good care of your belongings. Lobby: really huge and comfortable where a lot of people can sit comfortably in case you have to wait upon checking in or out. Looks really nice as well. :) City Vista Rooms: yes, the rooms are a bit small, but let's face it, its hongkong and we dont get to see so much big rooms here. Even though they're small, it's really clean and they have nice comfy bed sheets that they change everyday. Really well maintained. Also, the rooms have complimentary water, coffee and tea replenished everyday. If you ran out of drinking water, you can always go to their pantry, and refill your bottles. The bathroom was really nice too with a shower heater installed to it. Also, it is complete with toiletries (bath gel, shampoo, toothpaste, toothbrush, comb, slippers) and towels, which are also changed daily. But I have to suggest to just bring your own soap since the ones they provide can't actually clean you thoroughly. Also, the room is equipped with hair dryer, iron for clothes, electric water heater (which I dont think you'll need since you can always get hot water in their pantry per floor) and a safe which works really well. They also provide hangers inside the closet if you want to hang your clothes. Wi-Fi: i believe it is not on every package that wi-fi is free, but in our case, it is. Connection was really good, but the downside is, only one person can use it at a time so if you are traveling with others, you have to take turns in using the wifi. Elevators: their 4 elevators are already working but there is a note in our room that they are still updrading it. It is indeed quite slow, but based on the previous reviews, I can attest that it did improve a lot. :) Location: near the shopping area for mid-high range priced clothings also near MTR Jordan. :) Check out: really fast unlike other hotels that make you wait until they have checked the room if you have taken something from their bar.

This hotel is perfect! I have no complaints. Lets start with check in. We were lucky that we were able to get our room at 1:30PM instead of 2. There were some days that the lobby and front desk looked like chaos and pandemonium around 1 to 2pm but on the day we arrived everything was calm. So I guess you just have to be patient if you are going to wait for your room, which we did. We first had lunch across the street at Cafe de Coral, rice and noodle meals. Then we walked around the park to kill time. Went back to the hotel at 130PM and our room was ready. We just had to wait for the 2nd room (for the grandparents) another hour but that was okay since everyone could just rest in the 1st room. The rooms are small but what would you expect in HK and for the price. But we were comfortable --- a 5'11' dad, a 5'4\" mom and a little boy. We had a queen bed. Maybe for \"taller\" visitors and tourists the room would seem small to them. But for our physique it was okay. There is a 7 eleven across the street and a grocery store \"wellcome\" at the basement of the 7 eleven store. I bought fruits and drinks were cheaper at the grocery. So convenient. Kowloon park is right behind the hotel, a good 3 minute walk to get to the heart of the park. Beautiful park, perfect if you are travelling with kids because they need time to just run around, walk and explore. There is a big children's playground. Perfect! Park opens at 5am and closes at 12mn. There is a jogging trail too! Unfortunately i didnt bring any gear and was tired from walking all day. You can walk to Harbour City mall and the other malls along Canton Road! All the high end and mid-end shops are there! It is retail shopping heaven! Nathan Road is just a short walk up the street. You can actually walk down Nathan Road to the Avenue of Stars and watch the Lights and Music show at 8pm. So for the price of the room, it was worth it. We stayed for 3 very comfortable nights.

The hotel itself was spotlessly clean Staff all very friendly and helpful and most spoke perfect English. The rooms ( we had a twin) were not very big but certainly good enough for a few days stay. There was plenty of hot water and good size shower even though the shower room was very small. I always think if the bed is very clean and the shower is good that is fine for short stays. Our room was on the 20th floor overlooking the city so lots of lights at night . There gave you two free bottles of water a day which came in very helpful . The bar had happy hour for a couple or hours a night. and the buffet restaurant for lunch was very good. The hotel also looked after your luggage if you had a late flight which i thought was helpful too. you are within walking distance of the night market and ferries to Hong Kong Island and Macau as well as some great shopping malls I think if we visit Hong Kong again i would certainly stay at this hotel They do a shuttle from the airport to hotel for 110 HK dollars ( March 2012) one way We found this very helpful as we arrived in the evening and didn't really want to be getting on buses and trains but if you are young public transport is really cheap.

It is close the all the great shopping. If you want to shop high end then yes, Hong Kong is the place to be, but for cheap stuff like cell phone cases, just order it on Ebay and save yourself the hassle. I dont suggest going to the swap meet type areas like Mong Kok or the night market. It may look like a deal, but its not. Just go on Nathan Road or the malls for the small stuff, most shops will have the prices listed and they arent that bad. The best night food places are on temple street (2 blocks from BPI). Great price and really good food. There are 2 MTR stations near the hotel ( Austin street & Jordan Street stations) My Wife and I stayed here from 02/01/12 - 02/05/12 as part of a package deal when we went to the Philippines. We booked it through Holiday World Tour. I'll break it down to make it easier to read. Pick up at Airport- Coming in on a late flight was good because you get the shuttle service all to yourself. They say that extra baggage is $25HKD per bag, but they never charged us so we tipped the driver more..they just say that so you don't bring too many bags. The arrival agent was nice and so was the driver. Front Desk- Front desk staff was very helpful and answered all my questions, night after night. The check in was at night so there was no line. I went down to change my money and they told me that if i needed it now they would do it, but suggested the money exchange across the street for a higher return. It's the small things which really make the difference. The place right across the street isnt much more than the hotel ( Hotel= $7.30 for $1USD, Money Exchage $7.40-7.50KHD for $1USD). I found a place next to the Temple street night food area which always had a good exchange every night (Sun Rise Money Exchange & Remittance Co. Law Ho Yin 75 Austin Rd [--] she would always have $7.60 or even $7.80 which is really good. If your in the area then i suggest going there and she's really nice. Bell Desk service- Bell boys were very attentive and got our bags up to our room fast. They are also helpful with questions about the area. Rooms- We were on the 23rd floor and our room faced the skyline...WOW. you really cant beat the view. Rooms are a bit small, but we only used them for sleeping so it didnt bother me. Two to a room is MAX. The rooms are Very clean and updated (except for the TV's) Beds were comfy and they made sure they maximized all the space in the room. The Bathrooms are small as well, but updated, i really liked the shower...no pressure problem at all. Don't touch the mini bar, just go across the street, they have a 7-11 and a Circle K and the building next door also has a supermarket. I recommend buying some cup o noodles and use the hot water in the hall way...cheaper. Internet- The internet is NOT free. For 4 hours it is $50HKD, for 24hours its $100 HKD. for 24hours+ a mobile usb adapter its $150. And your timer starts when you first log on. Phone calls- Phone calls are not free as well. 1 local phone call cost $4HKD...not much, but it can add up if your not paying attention. Elevators/Lifts- there are 4 lifts....they are all slow. This is why i rated this hotel a 4 star instead of a 5. You can waste your entire vacation just waiting for these lifts. Watching everyone rush to the lifts on the ground floor is like catching the MTR during rush hour! Concierge /Tour desk- Very helpful, when it comes to the tourist stuff, but if your looking for food places like good ole street food, then you should talk to the bell hops. If you plan on going to Disney Land you can purchase your tickets here and avoid the lines at Disneyland. Same for Ocean Park. Restaurant- we didn't try the buffet , I rather go out and try the different street food vendors and our door eateries on Temple street. Hong Kong- so if its your first time to Hong Kong dont be intimidated...the people are very nice and most speak some English. If you want to get around take the MTR ( Subway) go to the customer service desk and pick up a Octopus card. The card deposit is $50HKD plus $100HKD. So when you get the card you pay $150 and have $100 to use. You get the $50 back when you return the card minus the $9hkd service fee if returned with in 30days. You can recharge the card at several loading stations and you can use this card for EVERYTHING, parking meters, Vending machine, Most types of transportation in tourist areas, Food, ect. FYI- Smokers....Hong Kong Is Very Clean and they want to keep it that way. You will notice that most people that smoke hang around orange trash cans with ash trays on top.That because they dont want to get slapped with a $5000 HKD fine for throwing their cigarette butt on the street. Same fine for spitting as well...yea thats right Spitting.

To start off, price is very reasonable compare to other hotels in HK during the holiday season. The rooms are small but expected consider the limited space in HK. We have 2 children so instead of squeezing into a fancy hotel in one room, we rented 2 rooms with very reasonable price. We had to stay in the smoking floor because this hotel does not offer connected rooms in the non smoking floor. We were unsure about that at first but it turned out fine. Ventilation was very good so we didn't really smell cigarettes inside the rooms. You would smell it in the elevator area though. I wish they would just get rid of smoking in the hotel or put connected rooms in the non-smoking floor. Hotel staffs were very friendly and helpful from bell service, cleaning crews, front desk, to the property managers. Rooms are very clean and neat but need some updating. I wish they would have a DVD player and a more advance TV instead. Otherwise, most of the basic necessities were there. Alot more than some motels and hotels in the United States would offer. Cleaning service was very efficient. They could be in and out within 30 minutes and our rooms would be sparkling clean. The mattresses and pillows were very firm and in good shape which we found that as very important feature after a long day of walking. You won't feel the springs like some hotel beds do. We have had worse beds in the Marriotts and Hiltons in the US before. Location wise, it is very convenience with a grocery store across the street and a Manning drug store close by. MTR (subway) is not as close as some other hotels but it was still within walking distance. There were some restaurants around but if you want varieties, you would have to take the MTR to MongKok or the heart of Tsim Tsa Tsui. We did not get the free breakfast package because there is a cafe de Coral across from the hotel which serves reasonable price breakfast with varieties. That was my children's favorite restaurant since their food was similar to American food. We got free wifi instead which is more important because you won't get any free wifi anywhere. I would suggest travelers to get free wifi instead of free breakfast since HK is a food haven. Afterall, we had a great stay in this hotel and I would recommend this hotel to anyone even family with young children.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWendorful hotel, excellent location, clear, nice service, good breakfast.\u201d", "Author": "Hussain125", "ReviewID": "UR122085724", "Content": "Wendorful hotel, excellent location, clear, nice service, good breakfast.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgetown, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cGood free internet, 1 min to airport shuttle\u201d", "Author": "Asrul", "ReviewID": "UR121752785", "Content": "My priority is always free intenet and good location.

Temple Street night market and Nathan Road are a stone's throw away. I don't disagree with the other reviews about the small rooms, but hey, we've got to be realistic here. This is Hong Kong and real estate is expensive and scarce. If you go to New York or Tokyo, the rooms are not going to be any bigger. In fact, we've stayed in even tinier rooms in NY. Within its category, BP International met expectations. Service staff was friendly and our bathroom was equipped with toothbrush, comb, shower cap, facial cotton, etc. We don't see these complimentary toiletries anymore unless we are staying at a 5-star hotel these days. One thing is that they only have 4 non-smoking floors, so be sure to request for it at check-in if that's what you want. One quirky thing: the hotel played the same elevator music the entire week we were there. I caught myself humming to the tune when walking on the streets. The poor hotel staff has listen to this same tune everyday! Tip 1: right outside is the pickup point for the Airport Shuttle Express bus that will bring you to the Airport Express train, if you don't want to take a taxi.

We stayed for 3 nights at BP International and thought of updating my fellow travellers on this hotel. Firstly, let me start with the good points - a) Excellent location in Kowloon. Close to all major tourist attractions in Kowloon area. Proximity to multiple restaurants and to the Jordan MRT. b) The lobby is vast and nice with some wonderful steel chandelier kind display c) Efficient check in process - did not take much time d) We requested for an early check in and they gave that to us - ordinarily there check in is from 2 p.m. but we got the rooms by 1 p.m. . This helped a lot since we were travelling with a child & an elderly parent. e) The hotel has a Scout Display souveniers in one of the floors which was pretty good f) Breakfast spread was also quite filling and of good taste g) Opposite the hotel, there was a 7 Eleven store which became quite handy for us. Apart from that the hotel was quite close to the Temple Street night market and was within walking distance. Now for the unpleasant parts - We were at the 14th floor and on all the 3 days that we stayed, we faced issues with the elevator, which somehow refused to stop on our floor. Had to climb down on most occassions to the 13th floor & take the elevators from there. Post reporting the problem, we saw notices that the elevators was under maintainance. Another bad experience we had at the hotel was with our luggages . It took more than an hour for the luggages to be sent to our rooms. The service boy who came with the luggage, simply just dumped the baggages near our door and left without even informing us. Can't seem to remember his name though. Overall service at the Hotel was quite apalling and I hope that the senior management wakes up & takes note of the behaviour of the staff there. A small suggestion to the Hotel - wrt to Breakfast - for stay beyond 2 days the spread becomes boring. Same set of food with no changes at all. Maybe, they could rotate the menu every alternate day. Additionally, I also feel that the rooms are really small for a couple with a child. Hardly any place to move around.

She said if we are not going out or coming back together at the same time, we should leave the room key to the front desk and anytime whoever comes back first can approach to the front desk and ask for the key to the room. We then left the key to the front desk and left the hotel. When we later came back to the front desk trying to obtain the room key to get to my room, there were long lineups of quests waiting for check-in and check-out. We had to keep in the lines waiting to get our key. It took us about 15 mins before we can have the room key. Can you imagine the hotel needs 15 mins before allowing you to go back to your room? Another occasion was when I came back to the hotel, I approached to the front desk to ask for the room key, I was told that my wife has already returned and took the room key. So I went up the room and knocked the room door. However, my wife was inside the bathroom and didn't realized that I was knocking. I have to keep waiting and knocking the room door for about 5 mins. During my period of knocking the door, I was blamed by adjacent room guests for my disturbing noise. This makes me very embarrass. Room was small but clean and tidy. Beds are of prisoner's bed size. Most of the front desk staff are having difficulty with communication in English. This hotel is just average. All staff are with miserable faces. You can never found smile on their faces even when you say \" Hi \" to them. This hotel is horrible ! When you walk in the hotel lobby, you look like you are walking into a funeral home as every staff is having a long face. Don't fooled by the hotel pictures.

It's a lot better than having breakfast outside the hotel, And rain is pouring during our 4 days of stay. > Housekeeping responds quickly. I asked for additional pillows and an adapter for my sterilizer. They sent it right away. >Bathrooms are clean. Water is good even the exhaust. Although I was hoping there's a faucet under the shower since it's hard to bathe my toddler using the shower.. And the free toothpaste is too small... >Rooms are clean even if it's small. There's no ironing board which could be very helpful too... And one thing that I really didn't enjoy from this hotel room is the noise outside the hallway. I can hear it clearly while lying inside the room especially at night... Our room is in front of the lift so you can hear people talking and children running. And the hotel music in the hallway is too loud I can hear it inside our room as well!!! > The location is great! There's cafe de coral in front of the hotel. Beside the resto is wellcome supermarket and 7-eleven. Kowloon park is at the back of the hotel. And most of the shopping centers is walking distance only. Like Harbour City, The One, Mira,K11, and Elements,. Temple street night market is also near. Starts at 5 pm where I got my souvenir chopsticks!

Cab cost about HK$100, because of the tunnel toll. Check-in was fast and easy. Lobby is separated in two parts, with a seating area and concierge in one, and just the main desk and elevators in the other. Looks very nice for a 3 star hotel. We also had to extend our stay 2 nights which they handled quickly. Elevators are SO SLOW. We stayed there for 7 nights and quickly learned to press the 'up' and 'down' buttons and ride it either way, because being in an elevator was better than just waiting for the one going in the right direction to come your way. Room was on the 13th floor, overlooked the city, but could see the park to the right. space-wise small, but god for HK standards and the price. Room was non-smoking (4 floors of the hotel are) queen bed. It had a safe, vanity, hair dryer, tv, 2 phones, luggage rack, and stocked bathroom. The showers were always warm or hot and were extremely powerful, rare for asia, but a welcome treat after traveling. Service was ok at the front desk, could be a little warmer and more welcoming. They always seemed annoyed to help and answer questions. An assistant was very helpful when we asked for extra sheets, some wire cutters to cut a lock that had broken on my luggage, and a corkscrew. Concierge is helpful. One complaint is the housekeeping. They were so eager to clean the room EVERYDAY. After we learned they refused to be turned away if we opened the door, we ignored the first two times housekeeping knocked another day until the assistant manager even came by and checked on us after calling us. If we have \"Do Not Disturb\" on the door, it means what the sign says. Another day, the housekeeping caught us just as we were coming back from breakfast, and insisted on cleaning our room when we hadn't even used any towels from the night before. We just gave up fighting and let them clean whenever they wanted. Buffet breakfast at the hotel was quite good. Served a variety of western and asian foods. for HK$85 it's not bad compared to what you can pay at other hotels, but you can get delicious buns at bakeries everywhere outside for about HK$20 max and fresh fruit juice stands nearby. We were given welcome drink coupons which we used the first night we arrived. The bar has live music from 9-11 and the atmosphere is basic, but fun. There are always taxis right outside the hotel, but there are 2 MTR stations nearby, Austin and Jordan. Austin, just one street away, and Jordan a few streets away. You can get everywhere on an MTR, highly recommended, easy way to travel. The Temple Street night market is walking distance. The Kowloon park is next door, also nice way to start your day every morning. Locals practice martial arts and exercise. There is an aviary and a maze. Various shops and restaurants surrounding the park.

I can say that there is nothing extraordinary with this hotel. The rooms were very small for the price and bathrooms were very slippery - be careful. My friends stayed in a guest house nearby and the room size were similar although less modern. Next time, I think I'll just stay at a guest house since I only stayed in the room 4-5 hours a day for sleeping anyway. The restaurant at the basement was absolutely delicious though. I will definitely eat there again the next time I am in the city. What's great about BP is that its really close to Canton Rd and Nathan Rd. Everything is very accessible and it is more secure than the guest houses available nearby. Customer service was average and the bell boy sort of rude but later apologetic, when I confronted him for it. My uncle, who I was with, got hit by a taxi and we had a to spend a day in the ER. I think BP should be more cautious with this. They should request traffic personnel near the pedestrian line since they have a lot of guests using it. If you want a \"hotel\" feel and have the budget for it, I would recommend this hotel. It is way cheaper compared to nearby 3-5 star hotels, but if you don't really care for all the fancy stuff, I'd say better stay in a guest house and use your money for some shopping. :D", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cVery good location...Stay in there...\u201d", "Author": "oguzk", "ReviewID": "UR96450043", "Content": "Hotel is located very close to all attractions and shopping...The rooms are Hong Kong standard but really good value for the money.

We were not affected by noise of the construction too much because our room is not located on the top floors and we went out most of the time. The breakfast buffet at the hotel restaurant is good ( a variety of Chinese and Western breakfast choices) at a relatively affordable price when comparing with two other hotels that we stayed from Dec 22 to Jan 03. Overall we found that the staff are friendly and helpful. The front desk staff are very professional and accommodating to our requests. When we found out the double/twin bed room that our travel agent booked for us is too small for three of us (two adults and one child), we have to request for a cot. However, we could have a cot for three nights, not 4 nights because of the limited number of cots are all reserved on Jan 06. Seeing our dilemma situation, the front desk staff (Kevin) suggested that we could upgrade to a family room with two bunk beds for an additional HK$330 per night. There are only smoking family room available but Kevin let us checked out this \"smoking\" family room before we made a decision. We found that this family room is acceptable. As well, we think this is a good deal because the hotel charges adding a cot for HK$350 per night. This family room does not have a kettle, coffee and tea bags but Kevin arranged to have these things provided in our room. We also requested for a late check out (3:00 pm) because we have to attend a family event until 2:00 pm. The hotel policy for a free of charge late check is until 2;00 pm.

The hotel is close to 3 underground stations so you can easily get around Hong Kong using the MTR. Or you can walk through the park and be at the ferry terminal within 20 mins. We were very pleased that the hotel gave us an upgrade to a superior room on our first stay, it was very spacious and had a good view. The standard room we had on the second stay was not as luxurious but still adequate (we missed somethings like the nice bathroom supplies), but we were happy that they at least had a room available when we arrived from our flight at 6am. The rooms are not too well sound-proofed, especially the ones close to the lifts. Overall, the hotel was a good choice because it was close to many shops and restaurants and the MTR so we could get around to visit the sights.

There is a coffee shop on the UG level and a self service laundry on the 13th floor. few floors in the middle are for parking and about 5 floors are of the HK Scout association. Dont expect a quite and peaceful reception area, its always full and with a lot of people around. The Concierge always seems to be full of luggage !!!! All in all.. a good lively atmosphere. Rooms: The rooms are small. I guess that this is a predicament for almost all hotels in HK so one should be ready for it. There is No Room service, though there is tea coffee making facilities and a mini bar in the room. The guys at the coffee shop were accommodating enough to heat up the tetra pack of milk for my daughter every morning. Each floor has a water filter and shoe polishing machine in the pantry. Ask for a higher floor, harbour facing room. The view of the HK skyline and the Kowloon park, more than makes up for the small confines of the room. The double bed was a bit cramped for us as we had our 2 year old daughter with us and we had not asked for extra bed. ( I doubt an extra bed would have fitted in the room though:-) ) But the bed should be adequate for two adults. A must check out is the Hon Po Palace restaurant in the basement of the hotel... yummy dimsums and other stuff. Location of the hotel is its main attraction. Smack in the centre of Kowloon. The Night market, The ladies Market, Avenue of Stars, Harbour City, Heritage, HK Space museum.....etc etc... everything is in easy reach. max 15-20 mins walking. or one can go to the Jordan MTR which is a five minute walk. Jordan MTR connects you to Central or Admiralty from where one can go to the Peak tram or the Ocean Park respectively The hotel offers a Airport Coach to go to the Airport priced at HKD 100 per person.

All payments were actually settled and signed during check out. Negatives ~ We were three with a city view room (two twin beds) and an extra bed so it was a bit of a squeeze. There is some room under the desk where you could store your luggage but the extra bed made access to this space very difficult. So we had to make do with our luggage on the floor and a few inches space to walk on. Not much, but it wasn't a deal-breaker. We were out most of the day anyway. There are signs everywhere of B P International being a no-smoking hotel, so it was quite strange that our room and bathroom smelled somewhat like cigarettes when we got there. We did not complain about this since it was not that bothersome for us. With the a/c left on, it went away after some hours so no problem. Positives ~ We slept comfortably in our beds, though narrower than normal twin beds, but the small size of the room made it quite cozy. With 500 plus rooms in the hotel, I expected to hear disturbing sounds but there never was any. I remember not wanting to get up from bed, thinking it was 6am because it was so quiet, but in fact was already around 9am. Bathroom was spotless, no complaints about this at all. Housekeeping was incredibly helpful, lending us everything from a 220 adaptor to a pair of scissors, and when asked, immediately bringing over an extra set of towels for our third person. No complaints about their service. Buffet breakfasts were not extensive but more than enough! I do remember them serving the same food every day.. bacon, hashbrowns, scrambled egg, fried rice, asian noodles, sausages, congee. There were also stations for cereal, salad and bread, and eggs. 85HKD per head definitely worth it. B P is a block away from Jordan MTR station.. easily reached with lots of local flavor around. Kowloon park just behind, and Chinese noodle shops, seafood restos, 711s and Wellcome supermarket just in front of the hotel. Money changers also just around the corner. We were actually billed for less than expected, and had no problem cancelling an online booking to take their shuttle back to their airport on our last day. The experience was pretty seamless, and given proximity to MTR and being right smack in the city, would likely come back!", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value, great location!\u201d", "Author": "Sunny_SJ", "ReviewID": "UR61812989", "Content": "This hotel was the first stop of our Asian trip and I am so glad we stayed at B P International.

This hotel is easily accessed via the CityFlyer bus ($33 HKD) which drops you off near the Jordan MTR (Prudential hotel/Prudential Center). It is about 3 blocks away from where the bus drops you off. The hotel is a bit north of the other hotels in the Tsim Sha Sui area and is on Austin Road just on the northern border of Kowloon Park. I booked the cheaper City View rooms, but was upgraded to two Harbor view rooms with excellent views of the Park and Victoria Harbor. Check-in was quick and easy and the staff spoke flawless English. We had arrived a bit early (2pm) and they were able to let us into our rooms early. The elevators are a bit small and fit only about 8-10 people in them, but were fast and we noticed that they put a little note indicating that the buttons were disinfected every hour. (Hong Kong is very pro-active about keeping things clean apparently and we saw this throughout town). There is a Wellcome grocery store and 7-11 across the street from the hotel which is convenient for snacks. There are also many restaurants within walking distance. Again, the MTR is within walking distance which is very handy for touring Hong Kong. The rooms were indeed on the small side, but did not make me feel claustrophobic (it was not as bad as described by some other posters and I had anticipated the worst). The rooms were clean. We had two rooms with two singles and a great view. The rooms included a refrigerator, hair dryer, water boiling carafe and coffee service. I was not sure if the bottled water was complimentary so did not use it. We asked for ice and it was promptly delivered but there was no way for us to get the ice ourselves if we wanted a refill (the staff would have needed to be called to get us more). The bathroom was very small but did include the usual amenities such as shampoo, conditioner, body gel, comb, toothbrush/paste and slippers. As reported in the other posts, on the second day, for some odd reason, both rooms smelled of smoke even though we were on a non-smoking floor. However, the smell went away once we turned on the Air Conditioner. Also, the hotel does not have a pool, but did have a restaurant (which we did not try). Overall, I enjoyed my brief stay here, and I would recommend it to others who want to stay in Hong Kong. It is clean, in a good location and has all the basic amenities you need.

Jordan is only several stops away from stops such as Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok, Central, Causeway Bay. These are several stops that I went to often. Kowloon Park is located right next to the hotel, so for those who like to work out (swim, jog, daily pull ups/pushups), this park is great. A great dim sum restaurant is right next to this hotel as well. The Tsim Sha Tsui harbour, where the Avenue of Stars/Bruce Lee statue/8pm light show is located, is only 15-20 minute walk from the hotel. Also at the harbour, you can take a day trip to Macau. Victoria's Peak- Take the MTR to the Admiralty station, and exit out where Hong Kong park is, through Hong Kong park, you can take the tram to the peak. OR you can just take taxi to the peak (around 40-50 HKD). This is only about 3 stops or so from the Jordan station by the hotel. 8pm Light show at the harbour- 15-20 min. walk from hotel, or take the taxi from the hotel, it would be 5 min. or less and would cost about 20 hkd or less. The Hong Kong museums and space museums are here as well, right next to the harbour. Lan Kwai Fong (bars and clubs full of foreigners)- Take the MTR to Central, and exit D. This is about 4 stops or so from the Jordan exit. Ladies Market- Located in Mong Kok, is only one stop away from the Jordan exit. This is a place where you can do a lot of souvenir shopping. There are also many stores that sell athletic gear, with many Nike stores and shopping malls in this area. The Langham Mall is also here as well. Stanley Market- Take the MTR to Central, it's only 4 stops or so away from Jordan. From the Jordan station, go to the bus station right outside, and take the bus to Stanley. The bus will indicate if it's going to Stanley or not, several buses will take you there. Knutsford Terrace- a strip of nice bars and restaurants. You can walk from your hotel which will take about 15-20 min or take the MTR to Tsim Sha Tsui, which is one stop away. Ocean Park- Take the MTR to Admiralty, which is about 3 stops or so from the Jordan MTR, and take the bus from Admiralty. Staying next to the MTR station in Hong Kong will make your trip in HK very convenient, which makes BP International an ideal place to stay.", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cNice Harbour view rooms\u201d", "Author": "Matt_Standage", "ReviewID": "UR48692328", "Content": "This is your typical Hong Kong hotel.

The hotel's lobby is quite spectacular and is a tribute to Lord Baden Powell who of course is the founder of the Scout Movement. The hotel has a Scout annexe, with it's own separate entrance from the main hotel and we saw many Scouts out on the street. Despite this difference the hotel was as good as any international standard hotel for service, appearance and cleanliness plus an in room safe. We had reserved a city vista room through the internet but on arrival found that it had two single beds and we wanted a double. The staff found us a double room ok but unfortunately it was on a \"smoking\" floor and the smell was quite obvious even when stepping out of the lift, one evening we accidently turned off the vent in the room and the smell was suffocating. The bed was the hardest I had ever slept on and the pillows were quite flat, in spite of that we slept very well. Maybe because of the room change we ended up with a room overlooking Kowloon Park and we could see part of the harbour. Our 4 night deal cost $3,190 HKD (no breakfast, extra 85HKD pp) which was one of the most reasonable in Hong Kong. We found a very good cafe called Marco's in a street across the road where you could get an English type breakfast or Asian or a combo of both for a very reasonable $22 HKD pp. We used the shuttle service organised through the hotel which considering the distance from the airport (about a 30 minute drive) at $85 HKD pp was very reasonable. I think the price has increased to $100 HKD now but still very reasonable. The hotel said that they had reserved a return journey for us too but it turned out that the earliest shuttle was at 7am and too late for our plane. We were well and truly ripped off for the taxi return journey at $329 HKD, (the hotel said it would cost $250 HKD) with the meter showing $185 HKD and the driver doing a calculation for what we thought were tolls and maybe an airport fee. We were just so flabbergasted and just paid but in hindsight I think we should have called his bluff and refused to pay so much. Other passengers we spoke to were similarly ripped off. Weighing it all up I would definitely stay here again, for price convenience and cleanliness it was worth putting up with a few niggles. Hong Kong is a great city, we felt very safe at all times. Make sure you do a day trip out to Lantau Island to see the giant Bhudda, it is just amazing! I did a search on Trip Advisor for Lantau Island and found a travellers instructions for a trip there, his detail was amazingly accurate and we followed it almost to a tee and had a great adventure.

Definitely the pictures found at the hotel's website show the rooms looking a lot better than it does really. The \"double\" bed that should be ok for two people barely looked like a single bed to me. there were three of us, and after they provided an extra bed there was hardly room to walk! We had to close our luggage otherwise we would be stepping on the beds to get from one end of the room to another. The shower area is tiny! Maybe it would have been better if it wasn't enclosed in glass. We were laughing one morning because one of my friends was taking a bath and we could hear his elbows hitting the glass. It was that small. This is my third trip to hongkong and though it was a relatively pleasant stay I would probably stay at a different hotel next time.", "Date": "March 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila", "Title": "\u201cclean and modern\u201d", "Author": "shanelovesryan", "ReviewID": "UR25755774", "Content": "the lobby looks elegant and checking in didn't take very long. we were given a smoking room but the entire floor didn't smell of smoke. the room was small but cute. my mom and i are both petite so we really din't have much of a problem with the size of the room. i guess taller people will have a bit of a problem with that. the bed was not as hard as some members have stated. you will definitely choose to sleep on it rather than on the floor. it was freezing while we were there so we turned the airconditioning off during our stay. the blankets kept us warm although they are somwhat old and overused. but i didn't care much since they were really clean. i loved the interior since it's modern as well as the bathroom. i love the strong pressure of the water as well. it's not entirely a sound-proofed room but i didn't experiencemuch noise coming from outside our room. our toiletries were replenished everyday and our room was also cleaned daily. and it's like a new room each time we come back. the tv has limited channels but it's ok since we didn't come to hk to watch tv. hehe. the elevators didn't take long however the carpet on the lobby is already dirty due to the contant raining so i guess they should change it more often. overall, i will definitely stay here again since i am scared to risk trying out other hotels in hk. the place is great and you can walk to any place, close to the mtr, night markets along the streets, as well as nathan road. i will recommend this to my friends.", "Date": "March 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cJust plain & simple\u201d", "Author": "jatv", "ReviewID": "UR25730899", "Content": "Its our first time to check-in at BP International and I must say for a 3 star hotel, price is just right.

But i was able to get on to internet via wifi. You can request the converter plug for your electronic devices from the front desk. Room also got a minibar, with free coffee, tea, chinese tea, kettle and safe in the room. I got a nonsmoking room, and amazingly the entire floor does not smell of smoke. Request for room facing kowloon park, which gives a nice view of the harbor, HK island and lower kowloon. bathroom is small but manageable, it is clean and they give you complimentary bath items. Water pressure in shower is super strong - so strong that you can hear your neighbors taking a shower! bottom line, it is a great location, just 3 mins walk to the nearest MTR station (jordon). Or just 20 mins to the harbor front. Temple street is a couple of blocks away, and there are shops and restaurants all within a block. It is not on Nathan road, so you are not overwhelmed by buildings, people and congestion. The room with a view of kowloon park also gives you a feeling of \"breathing room\". Finally, there is a free shuttle from the hotel to the kowloon station (for airport express train). It is shuttle K5, runs every 20 mins, starts at 6.30 am. The free shuttle picks you up from corner of hotel and drops you at kowloon station. You can check in at kowloon station for your flight (participating airlines only) - they will take your bags and give you a boarding pass (which you have to check again at the airport counter 30 mins before departure).

Firstly the not so good:- 1) The bed was the hardest bed I have ever slept in, or tried to sleep in. I quite like a harder matress but in all honesty, sleeping on the floor (had there been room to do so) would have been a softer option. 2) Cost of Internet access was HK$90 for a 24 hour period or HK$40 for four hours. They did not offer a discounted weekly rate which many other hotels do. Having purchased internet access, the signal was at best flaky and at worst unavailable. This was for a wired connection not a WI-FI one. 3) Lack of WI-FI 4) I thought the cost of the Breakfast buffet was a bit steep at HK$93,50, but that appears to be the going rate 5) The size of the room, the bathroom in particular was very small indeed. I was pleased I was a solo traveler. The bathroom amenity pack was pretty sparse 6) I left three English \u00a32 coins on the desk in my room. By the time i came to look for them, they had disappeared. 7) I could not seem to get the room temperature right. When sitting at the desk I was very warm from waist up and cold fro waist down Now the pretty good 1) Location - the hotel is close to Jordan MTR making transport very easy. Also there were always cabs available on the rank outside. 2) View from the room. I was in room 2128 and had a good view of both the harbour and of Kowloon Park. The only downside to this was being unable to close curtains to shut out the light when trying to sleep 3) The rooms were very clean and fresh towels were left every day. Its only a sam ethat tis was spoilt by point 6 above 4) The Wellcome Supermarket and 7-11 stores just opposite the hotel. All in all the BO is OK, but that is about it, just OK.

We stayed in a harbour-parkview room, which had a surprisingly great view of the harbour and Hong Kong skyline with a direct wide-open view of the 2IFC (the tallest building in Hong Kong) and the rest of Central, although a couple of buildings did partially obstruct the view. I do believe we got extremetly lucky with the view, and I don't think that every harbour-parkview room would have the Hong Kong view comparable to ours. This is definitely a 3-star, not 4-star. The room is tiny and the bed was nothing more than just basic. The hallway was gloomy and the lobby was also rather basic and no-frills, with cramped check-in counter. But the check-in was very quick and smooth, and we had no complaints with the service here. And the important positive was that everything inside the room was pretty clean although basic. I especially thought the bathroom was spotlessly clean; very small but well-designed with a nice new sink and a powerful shower. The location is decent, though not the best. It's on the north side of Kowloon Park, and the closest metro (subway) stop is Jordan only about 5minutes away. If you were to walk to the main part of Harbour City shopping mall, the Star Ferry, and the harbourfront area of Tsim Sha Tsui, it would take a good 15-20 minutes. The area right near the hotel isn't all that interesting, although it is very close to Temple Street Night Market. I will say that Kowloon Park that the hotel sits right next to is very pleasant, with an aviary, well-groomed gardens and a flamingo pond all within the grounds. A stroll through this park is a nice way to get to Tsim Sha Tsui from the hotel.

Staff very helpful even remembered our booking - we had asked for higher room with views overlooking habour. We were not disappointed got lovely view overseeing kowloon park and harbour. Def ask for it and no extra charge. Room size I personally thought were okay, yes slightly on small side particularly bathroom but we were not planning to spend alot of time in hotel room. Jordan MTR just around corner meaning you can go everywhere but have to admit for those who like walking it was about 10-15 min walk to ferry port. Transport is the best I've ever experienced it make London look real poor. Trains/buses/ferry/taxi all very easy and very cheap with the exception of taxi. Get a Ocptus card this saw us thru the entire trip and very easy to top up. The ferry ride is great far better then taking the MTR across the water.

Avoided local places (sorry am a bit picky!) but found it easy to find places to eat just look for packed places especially by the local as this was a sure sign of quality and prices. Markets, well did all of them! Would highly rec'd Ladies, Night Market usual HKG merchandise. Plently of fake stuff but HAGGLE as the prices are extremley marked up. Found Stanley mkt a disappoint as seller somewhat rude and not willing to barter. Shops on TST are bright and sparkling but beware as the prices and selling manner is not for the faint hearted. Buddha a must despite the long winded MTR and bus ride when you get there you forget the ride up and thru the mountains. Photographs galore and so tranquil makes you think about life! Laser show at Harbour is awesome. we took a boat and watched from middle of harbour. Could argue that seeing it from harbour side would have been just as good but hey we just got in the flow of it! Visited Stanley island alot peaceful then the TST not alot to do but the resturants by harbour are great and ideal place to do the people watching!

We were on holiday, not a business trip. This was our first visit to Hong Kong and we chose the hotel based on reviews on Trip Advisor. Actually my number one choice was the Salisbury YMCA (based on TA reviews) but the YMCA was fully booked even two months prior to our trip. Overall I was pleased with the BP, although I would have preferred to have been closer to the harbor. Location: The hotel is at the north side of Kowloon Park on Austin Road just west of Nathan Rd. The street in front is rather busy but our room was on the backside of the hotel (I wanted a view of the park and harbor) and was very quiet. Room: Having wanted a room at the Y where everyone recommends a room with a view I followed the trend and booked a room with a view at the BP\u2026.and it was worth it. (See attached photo of the view from our window.) It was quiet (as I previously noted) and even on the 21st floor we had a nice view of the harbor without too many obstructions. We could view the nightly light show, although once I saw it I wasn\u2019t impressed. The room (2137) is small but not tiny and there was plenty of room for us and our luggage. The bathroom was cramped, but again it was sufficient and had a very nice shower (no tub). The room was very clean, quiet, and acceptably dark drapes to block out the morning light. A great bonus was excellent air conditioning. Restaurants: We never tried the hotel restaurants. I checked out the buffet but the minute I saw the pickled ducks feet on the salad bar I decided not to eat there. Down near the harbor was a building called the East Tsim Sha Tsui Centre that had western restaurants. We had a good meal at Outback. We also tried the Spaghetti House around the corner on Nathan Rd (just north of Austin). We had acceptable Italian with some interesting but fun miscommunications. A waiter brought our food although he was not the same person who took our order. I asked for glasses of water. He looked a little confused but then paused, walked over to the next table and returned with extra silverware settings for us. I said, \u201cno, we would like some water\u201d. He returned with two mugs of hot water. I stopped trying and we made do with our warm water. Another evening we were on the island and ate at California Pizza Kitchen in the Times Square mall. This was especially funny since I had never eaten at CPK in the states. Across the street from the hotel is 7-Eleven. Next to 7-Eleven (and down some steps) is Wellcome, a grocery store with fresh produce. Over on Nathan Rd across from the park is Pacific Coffee Company where I went for my morning coffee. Transportation: From the airport we took the express train to Kowloon. Even though there were only two of us we qualified for the \u201cgroup\u201d ticket. They were 70 HKD each instead of the usual 90 HKD. At the Express station it was very easy to catch the free shuttle to the airport. We walked to the shuttle area and very helpful attendants asked what hotel and pointed us to the right bus. On the return I did not attempt to take the free shuttle bus from the hotel back to the express station. The bus only runs every 30 minutes and because we were leaving at 7:00 am I did not want to stand around. The woman at the front desk told me that a taxi to the express station would only cost 20 HKD ($2.50 US) and she was spot on. It took about 5 minutes and was exactly 20 HKD. In town I did not get the Octopus card and I\u2019m glad because mostly we walked. When we did finally take the subway it was incredibly easy to use. They have machines where there\u2019s map. You touch your destination and it tells you the amount to put in for the fare, for example we went to the Wong Tai Sin temple which is about 6 stops from Jordan. The machine told me to put in 8 HKD (the machines take coins) and out popped the ticket. The subway trains are clean and nicely air conditioned. Price: I checked all the various sites and prices were about the same. I booked directly thru the hotel site because I wanted to make sure I got a room with a view. I paid approx. $185 USD.", "Date": "October 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sydney, australia", "Title": "\u201cwould stay again\u201d", "Author": "roz_dog83", "ReviewID": "UR10257792", "Content": "the BP internation is located in tsim sha tsui right in the heart of kowloon. it's a 5 minute walk to the MTR station and about 10-15 minutes to the star ferry terminal. i recieved a free upgrade on arrival, which meant my room looked out over kowloon park and victoria harbour. the rooms were clean and nicely done, if a little on the small size, although more than adequate. the staff were always helpful and friendly. as others have said this is the headquaters of the hong kong scout movement so there are lots of scouts and their parents floating around, however generally they use a separate lobby and lifts. i would definately stay here again and would recommend this hotel as a moderatly priced, but good value hotel", "Date": "October 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wigan", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location\u201d", "Author": "Margreen", "ReviewID": "UR10213490", "Content": "We stayed at the BP International for 2 nights in October and found it to be in an excellent location for all the shops and amenities.

It is in a great location (near the subway, beside a park, and near lots of shops and restaurants). The thing I liked most about this hotel was the great location and view. My boyfriend and I stayed in a room that faced Kowloon Park. You get a great view of the Hong Kong harbour and all the lights in the evening. I used the park in the mornings to go for runs, which was convenient because access to green space is limited in HK. The staff were accommodating when I requested a quiet room that faced the park. Being vegetarians, this hotel was also in close proximity to about 10 different vegetarian chinese restaurants, which was really great. The hotel is only about a 3 minute walk to the nearest MTR subway station (Jordan). In regards to the interiors, the hotel is fairly new and the rooms look clean and modern. The only thing that visitors should be prepared for is hundreds of boyscouts and girlguides that use the hotel as a dormitory. But you only see them in the lobby, so it wasn't a problem.

Our checkin was very professional and courteous. We travelled on a Corporate package and were allocated a harbour view room on the 24th floor, not much to see on arrival but the view was magnificent especially at night when the clouds finally lifted. We had no trouble with noise & hardly saw any scouts as they have a separate bank of lifts and are only allocated between between certain floors on the lower levels. The room was spacious enough for the 2 of us, clean, modern and comfortable. Muted colours, comfortable bed, fluffy pillows and ducted airconditioning. The bathroom was small but clean and the shower pressure wonderful. As space is at a premium I thought the concealed space in the desktop for the hairdryer with a mirror on the lid was ingenious. The tea & coffee making facilities, fruit basket on arrival & an English newspaper each morning all nice touches. Breakfast was a Asian/English buffet with a cook standing by for any requests. Two free internet terminals from 3pm in the bar were handy to check emails especially during happy hour.
