The place had no lift, the rooms were dirty and small and their staff were rude and unhelpful. For what I was paying, I was hoping for at least something decent. I've stayed at hostels that were cleaner than what I encountered at Hotel Spagna. I made the booking with this hotel based on their photos featured on their website, location and costs.

After lugging heavy luggage up stairs to our room without any assistance, my mother in law immediately burst into tears and we quickly checked her out and into a hotel down the road.The room was small, dusty and dirty. There was rubbish in the drawers and cockroaches in the wardrobes. We had a double room that consisted of two single beds. Although we put them together before we went to sleep, they were about eight inches apart by the morning.There was no shower area in the bathroom, just a shower against the wall. The shower curtain fell down as soon as I touched it. The final straw was the complete absence of any hot water at all in our room - a basic amenity you'd expect in the simplest accommodation you would find.We immediately checked out after a single night and popped down to the hotel where my mother in law was. I demanded a refund, but the sour-faced, unpleasant woman in reception flat out refused. When I threatened to post this very review and notify the agent who booked this hotel never to recommend it again, she simply shrugged her shoulders and said, so what?. They didn't care that they were losing business and boy it shows in how the entire hotel is presented.I have travelled extensively and stayed in a 2 star hotel a week before in Paris that was far, far superior. The very fact that this hotel has 2 stars beggars belief. I sincerely believe that upon review, they would have a star stripped.A serious warning to travellers. Never stay in this hotel. Be wary of the photos on their website, they are not authtentic or representative of the true squallor of Hotel Spagna. There is nothing worthwhile about it. It has a great location, but there is a nice enough 3 star hotel down the road for only about 20 euros a night more - it's worth it for a bit of service and some hot water.Four weeks in Fawlty Towers is far, far more appealing.", "Date": "Jul 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR230014171", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Blank45000"}, {"Content": "Hotel Spagna - Overpriced sub-standard accommodation On our travels through Italy we had pre-booked accommodation in Florence at the Hotel Spagna. On their website the Hotel looked reasonable although a bit over our budget of 120 euro per night ($A200). On arrival we were given a room on the 5th floor  had to lug our bags up the narrow stairs (laid with the dirtiest, worn, red carpet I have ever seen) as there was no elevator. On entering our room we were confronted with an awful musty smell. The room was dusty, there was hair in many areas of the tiled floor, the fold out divan was dirty  stained and in general, the whole suite was un-inviting. On opening the window, the view over the terracotta roof with the gutters filled with rubbish and smelly residue water, was enough to put you off Florence let alone this Hotel. At night, I wasn't sure whether we were bitten by bed bugs or mosquitos breeding in the gutters. The only consulation was that the sheets were clean each day.Our advice: If visiting Florence do not stay at the Hotel Spagna, it will be enough to put you off all of Florence.Carl  Anne TrottaGisborne, AustraliaOctober 2007", "Date": "Jan 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR476639202", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Larcenna"}, {"Content": "Great Location.. Not so great hotel.. After having a decent hotel in Venice we were hoping for about the same when we got to Florence. We were WRONG! Though it's in a greatttt location the hotel is just not great at all. It's old, breakfast was horrible (except their coffee/chocolate machine was good). We had to pay an extra 10E a NIGHT for A/C. The showers were extremely small and you literally had to open up the shower and put your foot on the toilet to shave your legs or to get your shampoo/soap from the sink (Picture a shower like in a RV). if you needed to use the bathroom you had to open up the shower doors to actually be able to sit at the toilet. Water leaked from the bathroom into the room. Small TV, the third bed was a very OLD cot. You have to drag your luggage up the steps...

It's really easy to locate, because it's really a few steps to everywhere. It's located in the Via Panzani, and beside it were also hotels.I honestly doubt the 2-Star rating given. To get to the reception, you should climb the stairs (there were 5 of us and 2 of them are childrens) with heavy luggage. We had requested before for a private bathroom, and wow, considering the so many luggages we have and the childrens travelling together with us, they gave us the highest top floor! So imagine the 5 of us working hard to get our way to the top floor(4th storey!) without a single help from the staffs! The receptionist also told us that if we need an air-con, we need to pay for an extra charge of 10 Euros per night for each room. We did pay, for the summer's weather was getting worse, and it would be quite impossible to sleep.The first room is a triple room, and it's quite a big and spacious one with minimum lighting (some of the lamps were actually not working), the air-con produced large humming sounds, TV was small but OK. The problem is cleanliness. The linens are all OK, but somehow the rooms was so dusty.The bathroom was also spacious. The problem was with the shower. We didn't know why for the first 2 people who took a bath there, all that come out was hot water (we tried every way, every movement). Sometimes the water got really worse like a boiling one. Luckily for the third person the water wasn't that hot, but still we can't manage to adjust them. The flush of the toilet also gave us some problems. After we flushed them, there would be a really noisy pump sucking out water for 5 minutes.The first night suddenly the lights are out. And so the air-con. Luckily they got it right in 20 minutes. It was OK for the first room who face out the street. But the second room had a window which faced the other room's window, and it's horribly dark there.We had no breakfast there because it's an extra charge and we prefer to sit down somewhere else.On our way to check out we need to bring the luggages down -- again.I don't reccommend this hotel for anyone who travels with more than 2 people, children, and someone who carry heavy and big luggages.

We found Hotel Spagna had a room available within our price range. It was a standard sized room, not overly big, and neither was the bathroom, but it was fine. We left the room and went and saw the town. We had a great dinner at a nearby restuarant. We really didn't have a problem with the room until the middle of the night. It was hot, and they wouldn't turn the air conditioning on because it wasn't summer (It was the end of May), so we opened the window. A pigeon decided to sit a few stories above our window and be very loud all night. We think at some point a friend joined him. So we missed out on a few hours of good sleep. In the morning we went down to breakfast, it was basic, juice, coffee from a machine and rolls. We decided to move on and not stay in Florence another night. Upon check out, we asked directions on how to get to the Prada outlet nearby, and got directions from the woman at the desk. We checked out and took the train to the town the woman told us to go to, we got off the train and went to find tickets for the bus that goes to the outlet. At that point we were told there weren't busses that go there. We then went to the information center, who told us we had to take a train back in the direction we came to another town, and from there taxi. So we had to pay for another train ticket and 11 euro for the taxi to take us (but luckily we took the taxi, because we never would have found it). Essentially, she gave us bad directions and after a bad nights sleep, I wasn't in the best of moods.Overall the hotel was ok, but the experience left a bad taste in our mouth.", "Date": "Jun 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR931372993", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Not Worth the Price! The experience at Spagna left quite a lot to be desired. We booked 6 nights at this hotel and were seriously downgraded on the fourth night. They moved us to a room with a shower right in the middle of the floor and no toilet. We were expected to walk past reception down the hall to go to the bathroom. We paid for a hotel room but got more of a hostel type situation. The manager refused to refund us so we had to move to another hotel around the corner on our own dime. We found the service poor, the rooms were the least clean of the five hotels we stayed at in Italy and I would advise against booking Spagna if you get motion sickness.
