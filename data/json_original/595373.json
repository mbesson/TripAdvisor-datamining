Our room had an adjoining door with a group of teenage girls in town for a dance competition; the sound damping wasn't good so lots of giggling bled through the door and the hallway, but it was usually quiet by the time we went to bed. Service was great -- my girlfriend accidentally left one bag on the Silver Line on the way over to the hotel, and the gentleman at the front desk helped her get a number for MBTA that was still open after business hours, and they were able to sort out the situation. Having a Silver Line stop a block away, and South Station within walking distance if we stretched was quite convenient. We ate once at the Irish pub in the hotel; my burger was a little overdone, but her order of Irish sausages was excellent. On the weekends, there are very few dining options in the neighborhood, because the nearby Financial district is almost completely shut down. The small Starbucks in the lobby doesn't have enough capacity for the size of the hotel, which means that finding an affordable breakfast is difficult.

We have stayed in many Westin hotels and this one was incredibly disappointing. Why can I hear the people above us walking around? I just want some sleep. Is this the Motel 6? Oh, no that's right I paid over $249 a night to stay here so this must be the Westin but as we continued with the weekend it proved to be Westin employees working at some other hotel. The staff are wonderful with baggage, cleaning, and concierge services but they need to work on delivering on the amenities that are expected with the Westin name. We travel alot and try to stay healthy and one of the reasons we normally choose the Westin is to have a hotel that supports our healthy lifestyle, but not this one! There's a large non refrigerated snack case with nothing in it!!! Hello............. there is a convention going on and you know the hotel is going to be full, why are you not prepared? No snacks and No water in our rooms to purchase and the water out of the tap was appalling, get a filter!! So cloudy with sediment swirling (that never disappeared, yuck) that it was not something you would put in your mouth. Given that, why is there no water in my room???? Interesting that when I go down stairs even the Starbucks is out of water, really???? We are human beings we need water, kind of essential. I requested a refrigerator so I could have fresh healthy snacks for the convention, since eating out isn't that healthy or easy when 25,000 people are at the restaurants surrounding the convention center. They said they only have a few refrigerators and they were out, I had called to reserve one 2 weeks prior. Kind of ridiculous when a Radisson hotel can provide one in every room! It's a high end hotel get some refrigerators come on! It's great that it has a gym and pool but the chlorine in the pool area is so strong you wouldn't want to stand in that suffocating space for more than a few minutes, so it's pretty much useless. And again, no water in the workout room!! We are human beings and we paid a bunch of money to stay at your hotel, can we at least have some water????? On a positive note, the beds are amazing. But why are there no fans in the bathroom?? I am a professional, I need a bathroom that I can get ready in that has a fan for the steam from the shower!!!

The Old Town trolley also picks up in front of the hotel, which goes all over Boston. It's worth the money and is a serious time saver. There is a restaurant/bar built into the hotel and a small bar facing the exterior as well as a Starbucks. The good thing about all these restaurants/bars is that they make the hotel convenient. The hotel store doesn't have much in it, but there is a CVS near South Station on Summer Street. The hotel is very clean as well as the gym. There were several Life Fitness elliptical machines, which is a plus imho and there is a small pool next to the gym. Walking or running down Summer Street in the morning is a serene experience and makes for an interesting way to see Boston, but it's a long walk/short jog, so just be aware before you venture across the bridge. Also, if you have kids, the Westin isn't very far from the Children's Museum.

It is the second time I've stayed at this hotel. Overall I would describe the hotel as your standard, convention center hotel. It is next door and connected to the Boston Convention Center, so if your event is in the CC it can't be beat. The decor in the lobby is modern. Rooms are standard size...well appointed with HD flat screen TV, great beds, nice sized desk, and a sitting chair. Bathrooms have a tub/shower combo with double shower head. In-room internet service is available at two prices depending upon chosen download speed (the new standard in hotels.) However, free internet with excellent service is available in the hotel lobby and throughout the Convention Center (easy access from the 2nd floor of the hotel.) There is also a good fitness center and indoor pool for working out. I didn't eat it the hotel as there are many options within a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. I did sample all the bars in the hotel, which can get crowded and slow if there is a big convention crowd descending at the same time. Staff is extremely professional, friendly and accommodating. We were always greeted warmly in hallways and the lobby by the hotel staff. This is a courtesy that I truly appreciate and I compliment the employees for making guests feel welcome and special. With regard to location, it is not in the center city...but it is an easy and safe 20 walk to Boston Common. For people who don't like to walk, a cab fare to the action is about $10-$12 one way. The hotel is also a block from the silver line of the T (public transportation). You will need to change lines at South Station to go most places, but it is an inexpensive alternative to taxis and walking.

The bathroom was clean, and the shower had two showerheads. The water pressure in the shower and the sink was not the best, though; okay but not great. One problem was that there was no TV remote when we first got to the room. After calling the front desk, a maintenance person came to the room within 10 minutes. He was extremely professional and friendly, and took his time to test out a new remote (which didn't work), then look at the TV to make sure it worked. He returned soon afterwards with a functioning remote and all was well. On his way out, he also fixed the alarm clock. These were small issues in an otherwise very nice stay. The hotel is attached to the Convention Center and located within a 6-10 min walk to the waterfront and a multitude of restaurants. It's about a 17-21 minute walk to the casual and very good Yankee Lobster restaurant. I found the area around the hotel to be safe and clean, even at night. There are daytime activities and good nightlife along the waterfront near the hotel (i.e., restaurants and bars), but it's a bit out of the way from the historic area of Boston and the Freedom Trail. You could walk to the main tourist sites, but taking a cab is a very quick and easy roughly $12 cab ride. You could also take the metro, which has a couple of stops very close to the hotel. I think that the hotel is great if you are here for a convention/business, but I can see how it would be a bit out of the way to see other parts of Boston. But, it really is an easy trip to get to downtown Boston via cab or metro. Parking is available for a fee in the hotel parking lot. It was not difficult finding spots. The cost was $32 per day, though, which I think is a little steep. Con: It would have been nice to have free wifi in the room. If I remember correctly, there was a fee for this (I didn't use it because there was a fee, so I am unsure of the charge). Room tip: ask for a quiet room with a city view. Not sure if I got lucky, but I got a top floor room with a terrific view of Boston. I would stay here again if going to the Convention Center. I was very comfortable and happy with this hotel.

Arrived around 9pm...nice large bright lobby but SO noisy..there was some sort of reunion party going on in the main bar/restaurant and you could hardly hear yourself think in the lobby. Check in was efficient. Our room was large and airy, with lots of floor space but the usual problem of not enough electrical outlets to charge all the electronics for our next day of travel. Went down to the Irish bar for some dinner....food and service was just average...and not an Irish staff member to be found (I actually asked as there was some particular information I needed that would have been a word of mouth thing). Decided to try the concierge but the desk was unstaffed for the 5 minutes we stood at it. Went back to our room and dialled the number but it rang out and eventually went to voicemail, we opted to give up. There was free wifi in the lobby area and two levels of paid wifi in the room. As there was something we needed to see from home online we opted for the Gold service (which the info said was required for streaming) at $19.95. Signal was poor and unstable and crashed at least three times in the hour (the charge was refunded at checkout when we mentioned this) The bed was large and comfortable. En suite bathroom was also a decent size and had the all important magnifying mirror. Double shower head with a notice about Westin's famous dream showers...and information on how to get the second head working. Well it certainly wasn't the shower of my dreams, even with both, pressure was poor. The location is great if you're going to the convention centre and a relatively short cab ride from the airport.

What this essentially means is that they charge you for almost everything and some of these things aren't exactly cheap. The rooms are large so it's easy to share them to keep the price down. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is bright and inoffensive and the bathroom well-appointed. The complementary toiletries are very nice. Additionally, the room includes everything you expect: mini-bar, safe and a coffee-maker that actually makes pretty decent coffee. The beds were extremely comfortable and the air conditioning worked well. Internet is available in the room at a (high) price (you can choose from two speeds) but it's free in the public areas (lobby, mezzanine etc.) Location-wise, the hotel is not central to Boston, but it's a comfortable 20-minute walk from the city centre. Alternatively you can take the silver line from World Trade Center station, which also provides a direct link to the airport. A taxi from/to the airport will set you back about $15 (excluding tip). I feel, considering the distance, the room rates should have been lower to reflect this. Note also that the room rate includes a copy of USA Today. If you don't want this, they will take the money off your bill. The staff in the hotel were all polite, helpful and attentive. Check-in was efficient, check out more so: they print your bill and take the payment from your card before you get up on the morning of your departure. Regarding eating, there's a branch of Starbucks integrated into the hotel. This is a cheaper breakfast option than the hotel's own offering, which is a highly-priced yet average breakfast buffet. I gave the Irish Pub a try for dinner, and that was fine but, again, the food was expensive for what you got. If you want to try somewhere outside the hotel, there are some options on the waterfront (past the World Trade Center) or along Summer Street. However, if you want a better selection you should go into the city centre (the Quincy Market, theatre district or Chinatown areas are good bets). The hotel also has a fitness centre and swimming pool but I didn't use those so cannot comment.

As many have said already, the Westin is perfect for one attending a conference at the BCEC. The hotel is spacious, airy, cool and contemporary in design. It's not warm or intimate. The Westin might be OK for a casual tourist since the World Trade Center T-stop is literally a 5 minute walk from the hotel; however, given convention business, it's unlikely that a \"special\" rate will be available to make the Westin Waterfront a better deal than other establishments closer to central Boston. I stayed in room 1308. Pluses: 1) The staff seems very prepared for large numbers of people passing through the lobby and/or checking in to the hotel. 2) Nice view of the Boston skyline from 1308. 3) Free internet in the public spaces. Wireless/wired access for a fee in the rooms (two speeds). 4) Very nice and spacious workout room with several Lifefitness treadmills, ellipticals, recumbent and upright bicycles. The indoor pool is just long enough to make laps possible. 5) The Westin is very close to restaurants in the Seaport area. The Seaport and Renaissance Hotels are the two other large establishments in this part of town, and both are only steps away from the Westin though they are technically closer to the waterfront. (The waterfront, incidentally, isn't a particular draw for any of these hotels including the Westin. None are actually on the waterfront). 6) Direct access to the BCEC (in a way both a plus and a minus depending on your point of view). 2) Rooms are typical Westin: contemporary, reasonably spacious, nice bath and amenities, and, of course, the Heavenly Bed. A little wear and tear is evident in some of the furnishings. Minuses: 1) Selection of dining establishments in the hotel is limited, especially for dinner. MJ O'Connors is an \"Irish pub\" that serves perfectly good food in a very casual environment. Prices are relatively modest. Sauciety is a breakfast and lunch venue that is actually more aligned with the open and contemporary design of the hotel. I had a very enjoyable lunch here. Too bad Sauciety isn't open for dinner! Other restaurants in Seaport are not far away even on foot, but good luck in getting in if convention activity is strong and the Seaport and Renaissance Hotels are full (which is highly likely). 2) While the Westin is theoretically within walking distance of central Boston, the environment isn't exactly \"walking friendly.\" Overall, the Westin Boston Waterfront is a very nice business hotel.

Bathroom......i have no words, amenities of all sorts and the shower to DIE FOR! i probably will get that shower for my own bathroom at home! it's called the heavenly shower and it even has the logo of the hotel on it! room is so clean. we stayed on the 10th floor and view was beautiful - you can see planes landing as if it was right outside your window. the hotel is spotless, coffee delicious! plasma tv the whole lot. we called concierge for mouth wash, the only drawback is the lady had no clue if they supply it and you could hear her on the phone asking other staff members. maybe a little more training since she works at the concierge? but apart from that she was very nice - the gentleman delivered it in like 3 mins? i didnt even get a chance to brush my teeth yet! The only thing the iron was broken and the water was leaking everywhere - but i mean you cant check that in every room (i know from experience). it took a little while to deliver the iron, but the hotel was very busy so cant blame them for that.

Although I booked a room with 2 beds, when I called to confirm with the hotel I was told they didn't have any double rooms available and was given a room with 1 king bed. Since there were 3 of us I wasn't too excited about that. They said it wouldn't be a problem to get a roll away upon check-in. On the day of check-in the other 2 in my party got there a couple hours before I did due to flight complications. Since the reservation was in my name they were not able to get in the room but the hotel did hold their luggage for them. I called to see if I could check-in over the phone and they wouldn't let me do that. Once I did finally arrive check-in was very quick and they were even able to accomodate my request for 2 beds. I should add that I did take the T (silver line / bus) from the airport. However, once I got dropped off at the closest station (World Trade Center) I had NO idea which direction to go. Here's what you do ... go into the building and get to the 2nd floor. There are 2 bridges. Take the bridge that would be on top of the building you were just in. Once you cross the bridge the convention center is to your right and the Westin is to your left. Not a big deal as long as your luggage has wheels! Both the hotel lobby and room were very modern and clean. There is a Starbuck's right off the lobby as well as a convenience store. One morning we ate at Sauciety which is also connected to the lobby. They offer a buffet which didn't cost much more than ordering ala carte. I think it was $23 for the buffet which included coffee and juice. Our room was spotless. The bathroom mirror had incredible lighting. The double headed shower was wonderful! The vanity was in the bathroom so getting ready in the morning for us 3 ladies took awhile. There was a good size flat screen TV as well as a long desk with an office chair in addition to a stuffed chair. The beds ... oh, the beds ... were probably one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in. In fact, one of the ladies that was with us is trying to find out what bedding they use so she can buy some for her home. We LOVED the beds!

The rooms were great with nice flat screens, wonderful beds and again, with all Westins, great bathroom ammenities. The shower heads, the towels and the complimentary toiletries are top notch. The hotel is not in the heart of the city. A good 2 mile walk can get you to the city, maybe a mile and a half. There is a subway stop a couple of blocks from the hotel which was not a bad walk to get to the subway and then it is a couple of transfers to get to the stop at the Old State House downtown. A cab ride downtown was about $8-$12. The hotel is situated close to the waterfront with Legal Seafoods, Yankee Lobster Company, Legal Test Kitchen, and several other nice restaurants and upscale sports bars. The Bank of America Pavillion is within walking distance too. It's a great place! But, if you desire to walk out of your hotel door and be in the heart of the action, you might want to stay more in the center of town. But, if you don't mind being off the beatin' path a little, you can't go wrong with the Westin Boston Waterfront. It is an awesome hotel. By the way, WIFI is $12 a night. The Workout center is very well appointed. The indoor pool is great with a hot tub there too. OH, can't believe I forgot this...there is a Starbucks right there in the hotel lobby...great!

We've never had an issue with the rooms -- they've always been clean and large enough.

The hotel is connected to the BCEC convention center, so if you're going to a convention there, this can't be beat for location. It also has in-house event space on two different sides of the hotel. Some things to keep in mind: 1) Both valet and self parking in an attached garage are available, but can get expensive. 2) It's in the Waterfront area, which I think of more as a driving neighborhood than a walking one. 3) There is an MBTA silver line (bus lines that run mostly underground in dedicated tunnels!) stop close to the front of the hotel, so you do have access to the T network if you're headed somewhere and don't want to take the car. 4) It's close to the airport, but there's not a complimentary shuttle there. However, if you can wheel any luggage across the street to the silver line, you can take that, or just grab a cab for the short ride. 5) As far as dining, there's an MJ O'Connors Irish pub, Sauciety (a slightly off-beat restaurant usually serving breakfast and lunch only), but there's also a couple bars and it does have a Starbucks, so at least it has the bases covered.

After reading all the reviews, I was a little worried at how far away it would be, but found that the World Trade Center area seems to be a newer area and a 5 minute walk to the silver line subway. We rode the subway for all our destinations, getting a 7 day link pass for $15 and walking around the city. We had a great time, and definitely recommend comfortable shoes. In retrospect, we would probably recommend checking out the Trolley hop-on hop-off tours that drop you off at the different landmarks throughout Boston, however, we enjoyed seeing the city from the Bostonions eyes too. You can walk 5 minutes to catch the Silver line, or walk a mile into boston to the South Station (red line). To get from the airport to the hotel, we rode a taxi, because at that point we would have been too overwhelmed to ride the subway, however, once you know about it, it's a very easy ride to the silver line World Trade Center to get off and walk 5 minutes to the hotel. If you would prefer not to walk, get a taxi. There are four food places in the hotel: Starbucks (open daily, but not late at night), Saucity (very expensive Breakfast only), an Irish pub restaurant (good food and drinks - recommend the steak tips), the Birch Bar (didn't try this) and the city bar (open at night). You can also walk about 10-15 minutes down to the Seaport harbor area where there are numerous restaurants including a deli, Legal Harborside (seafood), Legal Test Kitchen, a mexican restaurant, a great Italian restaurant (Salvatores), and others. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel because the breakfast restaurant was very expensive and the room service was ridiculously expensive! We ate a few things from Starbucks one morning, and otherwise walked/rode subway to the areas that we were seeing that day to find a restaurant. There are starbucks and Dunkin Donuts everywhere around Boston! We did take the recommendations of others since it was our 5 year anniversary and told them. Joseph was at the counter and SO nice! I specifically asked for a Harbor view up high and he got us a room on the top floor (presidential suites), harborside, and a bottle of champagne with a personally written card from Joseph! The hotel room had everything we needed, including a VERY comfortable bed. We slept in every day because it was so comfortable. We were given 2 water bottles in our room every day, and signed up for the green program in which we did not have room service change our bedding or towels, which earned us $5 each day for food in the hotel (which we spent at Starbucks).

The staff was generally nice but we never got a call back from the head of security (ourdesignated contact person for the fall) when we asked about a medical evaluation when my spouse's back seemed no better after three days. Staff was generally nice, but oddly and I think cruely, the concierge must stand his or her entire shift (8-12 hours). I liked the hot tub open 24 hours but its too small for a hotel this size. The pool area was clean, but there was enough hair in the bathroom drains in the pool area to make a mastiff. There were no suit spinners or plastic bags for suits. Lockers were provided in the workout/pool area which was nice...no unsightly work out clothes except in the appropriate areas. Also no report of spouse's fall. I wanted to check for accuracy, hotel staff mentioned legal concerns. Oh, and I rented a car through the hotel for the week end. Despite assurances it would be an affordable w/e rate, I paid top dollar. No written confirmation was ever given, I was told not to worry a week before the trip, but had to rebook after we arrived. Timing was fine. No waits. Turn down service was optional (Call if you want it, $5 off if you don't,) but we didn't ask and didn't receive service or money. That's it. Location is great for T, waterfront, chinatown, south station and The Common, but I'd look for an alternative for personal travel. This was a cororate trip.

The hotel has an interesting conservation policy: they will give you SPG points for not having your sheets changed every day and you can save water by not turning on the second shower head?!? I see how the first is a valuable initiative, the second is a little bogus; why does the shower have 2 heads in the first place? In fact, both are situated a little low, at 5'10 I had to crouch.

I own and operate a hotel and was shocked at the price difference it was a very busy weeeknd in Boston w Harvard and other school graduations but think the price increase was ridiculous. We stayed 5 nights and I am a memeber of their loyalty program and they would not offer any discount. The rooms are nothing special, not very clean and tiny. Exepcted alot more for the price. Had to pay for interent in the rm but could get it free in the lobby?? Then only good feature was the bed and bedding. Our iron was so old all the marking were worn off couldn't use it. Asked for a new one waited as we had to iron dress pants before our mtng. Called for the second time someone dropped it off but did not knock so we were sitting there waiting for nothing wasted half an hr. Came in a new box never opened plastic and all.... Was told at night the store in the hotel opened at 7am so instead of leaving that night to get a few neccesities we waited till the morning for the store to open. The person was half an hr late as I waited outside more and more pp stopped looking for items but it took them hald an hr to open maing us late for our mtngs again. The rooms were not inuslated very well could hear everything in the rooms next to us and the hallways got woken up the first night by pp returning to their rm late at night and at 5am the next morning by somone getting a shower next to us. Expect this in a lower end hotel but not when you are spending $400.00 a night. The front desk staff and conceirge desk was not helpful or friendly. Is that not we were payign extra for the service and extras at the hotel?? We asked the lady at he conceirge desk to reccomend a place to eat after a long day of travelling informing her we were not looking to get dresed up just go as we are and get a quick meal. She sent us to Mortos an expensive and very formal restaurant in which we felt very undressed. She called to make our reservation as I am sure she got a kick back for every referral. Come to find out the nest day their is a pub in the hotel that we could have eaten at ans not taken a cab as it was raining to the other restaraunt. Also asked her what to do and see as we only had one day that was not invloved w convention plans just told us the basics found out two days in from the bellman that there is a free shuttle that goes to the downtown every hr and a subway across the street....

The room was modern and tastefully decorated but I was surprised by little details missed by the cleaning staff like hairs in the tub, dirty walls etc. The bed was nice but I had trouble finding a pillow that worked for me. This didn't matter too much becasue the guys in the room next to me were partying and i could hear every word they said through one of the vents in my ceiling and also in the bathroom. If that wasn't enough the adjoining room (not the partiers) (interior door that joins two rooms) was not well sealed. I could see light under the door and hear everything they said as well.

Not so at the less expensive but equal in quality brands I mentioned above. Day two while getting ready I was surprised to find no iron in the room. A brand new one still packaged in a box was brought to me in about 10 minutes. This made me late for my first meeting and I was a little surprised I had to unbox and unpack the thing. It also being new smelled pretty bad leaving me to wonder if I should have also stopped to read the directions about what do do before using. On the Maintenace side my door deadbolt liked to pop out causing the door to not latch but remain ajar. As one who freqents hotels and knows doors generally close loudly i didn't realize it didn't actually shut until an hour after I entered the room the 1st time. It also had this issue when leaving requiring me to insert my key card to unlock it from the outside in order to close the door.

Complaint: While \"livid\" is too strong a term, I am furious about the conditions and experience of my recent stay at the Westin Waterfront in Boston. Never before have I paid so much for so little in return. Traveled with family. Due to flight delays the payer was late to arrive and we had to provide a credit card to swipe at check-in. Despite assurances that the original card would be billed for the stay all the fees were applied to the wrong credit card. We were advised that the room was an upgrade, it reminded me of a dorm room. We requested another room and were given a new room on the Starwood Preferred Guest floor. That room needs to be refurbished. The room was noisy and that became evident at night when it sounded as if an industrial vent rang along the ceiling. This may be a problem in several rooms since the lobby store had sold out of earplugs.

I previously had stayed at the Westin in Fort Lauderdale and was blown away by the service, the location, the fabulous smell and cleanliness, the valet staff was so nice and we didn't even have a car! I actually didn't have any intention on staying at the Westin in Boston because I wanted a hotel a little closer to the heart of the city. It was a hard find though due to Bruins playoff game 2, Red Sox game, Marathon Monday, and a Celtics game as well. When I came across staying at the Westin I thought, \"I should have thought of them to begin with.\" I wish I didn't excpet so much. After booking online and looking at their website, I wanted to call and inquire about the \"in room spa treatment.\" Bad idea.. the first woman who answered said they don't have a spa. I already knew that, I told her I was talking about the \"In room spa treatment\" that is mentioned on their website. Apparently she didn't know what I was talking about because she just hung up on me. I then decided to call a little later, hopefully after her shift. The second guy said that the concierge wasn't at their desk after trying to transfer me 2 times and that he would give me a call back. No call back after 2 days. I called again to try to get massages and the woman said the concierge wasn't at their desk and she would give me a call back, again. I asked to speak to a manager who then told me she would call me back as soon as she gets some rates from the outside company. She didn't call me back, some rude lady called back who said \"good luck with trying to get an appointment, it's the busiest weekend of the year.\" I asked if I could call her back directly when I wanted to schedule them. \"I guess so..\" she said. Fabulous. After giving up on the whole in room massage deal, we arrive at the hotel a few days later. The lobby smelled just as I rememberd, soo good. After checking in we got to the room which smelled like stale cigarettes and had stains all over the beside chair. We then tried to take a nap which could have been fine if we could drown out all of the people talking in the room next to us or in the hallway. When the \"valet\" got my car, she came cruising around to the front, and had to lay on the horn because a taxi and her almost collided. I couldn't believe my eyes. I think that she could have been a little more cautious with my car. I understand she beeped the horn, but maybe she shouldn't have been flying around to the front. I am highly disapointed with my stay at the Westin Waterfront. I did not ask to speak to a manager while I was there due to the fact of it taking 20 minutes to even check out. There were only 2 people working at the desk on \"the busiest weekend of the year\". I didn't even want to waste my time talking to someone who wouldn't have done anything for me. I will never stay there again.", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quebec", "Title": "\u201cCan't think of a bad thing to say...\u201d", "Author": "bigbadbruins", "ReviewID": "UR104534217", "Content": "Got a great deal on Hotwire, 2 rooms for 2 nights for 600$ (150$/night).

We arrived at Logan about 7 pm and decided to take the silverline to the hotel. Took us a 45 minutes from arriving at ground transport to getting to the hotel. We took a taxi $15, on the return, got there in less than 10 minutes and felt that it was money well spent. The entire hotel is absolutely beautiful, and we had great service. We both got rooms on the top floor 1(6th) with stunning water/city views, I am SPG-Gold so this may have been considered my upgrade.... hmmm Anyway, the rooms themselves were gorgeous and the beds wonderfully comfortable. The dual showerheads are great. My 8 year old niece loved the indoor pools and spa and most especially loved riding the hotels escalator's up and down, up and down.... The location of the hotel is not the greatest, but my sister wanted to eat at a couple of the seafood restaurants, including legal test kitchen, so this location worked out ok. We did buy a 2 day old town trolley pass which picked us up and dropped us off right at the front door of the hotel and was great for seeing the city. I ordered room service 4 different times in 3 days and each time it came in about 20 mintutes and the food was excellent. An excellent angus burger, serving of fries and a soda will run you about $28, pretty typical in a 4* hotel. Parking was $42/day. what else can I say but.... Ouch!! My only problem with this hotel was the business center. $24 for 1 hour in internet use. I never once saw anyone in there using the computers yet they had someone manning the office. Why not just have a few computers for free use? I really think when paying $200+ for a room you should have free wifi or either free use of computers in the business center. I know this is pretty standard in the more upscale hotels but they need to rethink this policy. I would have given this hotel 5*'s without hesitation except for this. Still, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hotel if you don't mind being removed from the city for a bit.

We intended to ring in the New Year and Celebrate my birthday. Pulling up to the Hotel in the taxi, The Westin Boston Waterfront is first class in a quiet part of town where one would feel very safe walking alone at night - trust me, I did and quite a lot. Arthur Lamele had checked me in, very friendly. he noticed from my driver license my birthday was coming and wished me a Happy Birthday. The room, bay view, 15th floor - exquisite with lavish furnishings, spacious and the huge King bed - one could melt into it for days. The bathroom is quite large and the heavenly shower - very nice touch although I chose to use only one of the dual shower heads. The following night I spent in and out of Boston Commons, Downtown, Fanueil Hall and North End. On my return I found a Cheese Platter, a Bottle of Wine, Crackers and a Birthday card from Arthur himself and thanking me for choosing the Westin to stay! That was aside from ringing in New Year perhaps the 2nd best part of the trip!!! Very classy and nice touch. Transportation to and From Logan Airport to the The Westin Boston Waterfront is simple via the Silver line to World Trade Center and walking across a bridge and Summer street straight to the main entrance of the hotel. Vs. a $21 taxi ride the $9/fare for a 24 hour pass on the \"T\" allows you to take the Silver/Blue/Red/Orange/Green lines - well worth it. Dining - MJ O'Connor's serves fabulous food, spirits and deserts. The Haddock Tacos are really good and the Choco-Moulten cake - awesome, just watch your shirt sleeves, it's messy. City Bar - fabulous place to meet clients and friends/family after hours to wind down for a drink or meet new people. Lindsay is the finest bartender I've ever met, polite and very intelligent & makes a mean Appletini with Chopan Vodka! The Westin Workout - Not only am I a Global Sales Manager for an Electronics firm, I'm also a fitness instructor after hours and the westin workout room was a very nice complement to the hotel. State of the art LifeFitness Equipment with Virtual trainers along with a pool and jacuzzi worked well with my needs and open late hours.

The suites are usually 2 rooms, 2 entrances with a queen bed and 2 full bathrooms. One room has the bed,bathroom, table and TV while the other room has the living room with TV sofa, dining table and other bathroom. The suites have a view of Downtown Boston and Boston Harbor.

We enjoyed the hotel and were very pleased with our stay. Overall: This is definitely a business hotel, and we reaped the benefits of the expanded services offered by a business hotel, even though we were on a leisure trip. We took a red-eye flight so arrived at the hotel around 7:00 am, but they were able to check us in! I know this depends on availability, but I've been to hotels where they won't even check to see if they have openings that early in the day. The front desk and concierge staff was universally friendly and helpful, even sharing some restaurant recommendations and making change. Here's one feature I loved: The hotel lobby has two computer stations where you can log in, check on your flight, and print out your boarding pass. They also have a screen in the lobby (as well as a station on the in-room TV) with what I call the \"departure channel,\" which lists upcoming airplane departure times. Location: I saw some complaints about the location of this hotel, but we liked it a lot and found public transportation options very easy. We were a 30-minute walk to most of the popular locations in Boston. The T stop is right across the way, and we could be at South Station in minutes. I recommend the $15 one-week LinkPass. Also very convenient to/from the airport (just hop on the Silver Line, which is a bus, to the World Trade Center Stop, go upstairs, and walk over the pedestrian bridge to the hotel). The Old Town Trolley Tour picks up and drops off right at the hotel's lobby. We didn't use a single taxi for the whole trip. There aren't restaurants, liquor/grocery stores nearby, though, so plan accordingly. (Try MJ O'Connor's at the hotel, maybe!) Room: Our room had a great view of Boston and a bit of the harbor. We put down the see-through shade but didn't close the black-out curtains, so we woke up every day to the lovely view. The bed was very comfortable. We had all the standard in-room amenities, like single-serve coffee maker, glasses, ice bucket, bottle opener, etc. The bathroom was comfortable and equipped with lotion, shampoo, conditioner, blow dryer, robe, etc. (no fan, though -- boo!). Everything functioned well, and we had enough room to spread out. The room was mostly very quiet, but we could hear people/housekeeping walking by sometimes. Everything was clean, and housekeeping was inobtrusive. Dining: The in-room dining was very standard, but it's available 24 hours, which is nice. We ate twice at MJ O'Connor's and were very pleased with it. The food and drink were tasty (we had Dark 'n' Stormy cocktails and Harpoon beer for drinks and fish 'n' chips, chicken salad, pizza, and the fabulous hot dog platter for food), and the service was friendly and attentive. Highly recommended! We tried City Bar once, and the food was good (I think it shares a kitchen with MJ O'Connor's), but the service was pretty poor. We had breakfast one day at Sauciety. The food was pretty tasty, and the service was passable but not great. I'd call the food and drink prices very high, but it's a hotel, and it's in Boston, so we weren't surprised or put off.

It's the thrill of the hunt! I happened upon a fantastic promotion for Westin's Boston Waterfront Hotel. I won't name the specific promo, as it may not be in effect when this is posted, but it is definitely worth looking at the Hotel Special Offers section if you are booking directly through Westin's site. It is also noteworthy that when I needed human assistance with my reservation, the Westin Worldwide Reservations line provided a very friendly, well-spoken, patient, and incredibly helpful representative on multiple occasions. Now to get down to brass tacks... The first thing I want to address is getting to and from this hotel. I have read in some of the other reviews that the hotel is not close to a T Stop and is difficult to get to via rapid transit. Well, five years ago that may have been true. However, with the addition of the MBTA's SL1 Silver Line service, there is now a T stop (World Trade Center) that is a <5 minute walk from this hotel. On the other hand, unless you want to go way out to the airport, this segment of the Silver Line only connects to the Red Line (South Station), so I did find that getting to major attractions often required changing trains. But personally, that doesn't bother me if I'm not in a big hurry. Secondly, it is indeed true that this hotel is not close enough to the water to grab a snorkel and jump right in. But it's not really that far away. I had a beautiful view of the harbor and a large chunk of the Boston skyline from my standard room. Furthermore, a quick check of Google Maps revealed this fact before I read a couple of the nasty reviews about it. I won't disagree, though, that the word \"Waterfront\" in the name might give some the wrong idea. Front desk staff at the Westin Boston Waterfront were friendly and helpful, but few and far between. There were ~six computer terminals at the front desk, but only two were occupied by staff. This should not have been the case at a large hotel, especially on a weekend. I did get quick service when checking in, but had to wait to check out. This brings me to another issue. No automated checkout system. At least not an obvious one. Personal touch is nice, but when I'm ready to go, I would much rather speak to a computer than wait in a line. My room was very nice! I could not get over how clean it was. I expect a clean room, but it looked as though I was the first person to stay in this one. As I mentioned above, I had a wonderful view in this standard room. It was also quite spacious, and included a flat screen TV, a desk, an easy chair, floor to ceiling windows, and of course, Westin's signature Heavenly Bed. And trust me, the name is very appropriate. The bathroom was also very clean and included a beautiful black marble vanity, Kohler fixtures and the Heavenly Bath (basically just a dual shower head and tea scented shampoo). One last thing I would like to note. And this really erks me. Westin is one of the few hotel chains that still charge for internet access. And it is NOT cheap. I had to rack out nearly $26 for two days of access. I wish that Starwood (the parent company) would step out of the time warp on this one and realize that internet access is as essential in a hotel today as a bed. This is doubly true for a business traveler. Overall, my experience at the Westin Boston Waterfront Hotel was great. I would definitely stay again and I would recommend it to friends and family staying in the area. 4 out of 5.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Elmsford, New York", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our stay at the Westin Waterfront\u201d", "Author": "Julacco", "ReviewID": "UR76989597", "Content": "Just wanted to let you know that our stay at the Westin was awesome and everyone and everything was awesome.......we were there for the APWA Convention......Amy Driscoll was more than accomodating and quick to reply when we needed to amend our reservations....

I enjoyed the hotel's location best in the early morning hours, as there was little-to-no traffic ... ran a few miles around the waterfront along the warfs and found not one, but TWO Dunkin Donuts within a quarter-mile! So much better than the hotel's Starbucks! Walked to the train station for lunch one day - it's on the same side of Summer Street as the hotel, so just stay on the side walk and you'll find it. The food court had plenty of choices: Pizzeria Reggina, McDonald's, Chinese, salads, bakery, etc. On the way back, I passed a shopette and was able to buy a bottle of wine and snacks for my room - again, same side of the street. Gas station is easy to find if you turn right out of hotel - it's about a half-mile further down Summer Street. Hotel's hallways are as long as they are in Las Vegas, but elevators are quick and plentiful. Be sure to ask for a room with a view because there are plenty that merely look out onto the AC/heating units. Probably would not stay again unless changes were made -- an airport shuttle and free internet goes a long way, especially when you consider there are other choices in the area.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, but far from the action\u201d", "Author": "Planner73", "ReviewID": "UR70434294", "Content": "The hotel was quite nice.

My primary reason was it was one of the only hotels accepting Starwood Points during that period. I opted for the Cash + points option and was able to get two adjoining rooms for $60/night plus 4000 Starwood points each. I had heard that parking was $32 night ($42 for valet). I disagree with this on principle and found out about a nearby lot on Necco (Off A St.) where I could park for $11 day. I still was not crazy about this, but it was very close by. I parked at a meter on the bridge across the street on Friday night and the next morning drove over to the lot, (maybe 3/4 of a mile walk). I discovered by accident that the street bordering the lot to the South (Binford) had parking spaces with no meters and no signs. I ended up parking there for the entire trip for free as there happened to be an open space. This is not a very populated area, mostly small offices and some warehouse space. If you get there on a weekend, should be able to get a spot there. Since we were taking the T mostly, we did not need the car for transport while we were there. There is also an excellent diner just a bit further South on A street from Binford @ Second St called My Diner which has cheap delicious diner food. Perfect for carbo loading the day before the marathon and also for breakfast on our way out of town. The hotel restaurant, MJ OConnors is actually quite good. We ate there twice. For 3 adults, two teens and a ten year old it came to about $100 with tip, including two beers. Not cheap but a good option if you don't want to go out. We iordered Dominos twice via the internet from a nearby location, which was a cheap quick dinner but couldn't get the thin crust for some reason. Not sure if that was an internet glitch or a local limitation. The rooms are very clean and spacious. The heavenly bed is just that, extremely comfortable and nice to sleep on. The firdge looks like it was once used as a mini-bar in both of our rooms but neither was cold so we did not use them. Not sure if they were just unplugged or not working. The lobby is very nice with a bar and free wireless internet access. Plenty of comfy couches to sit down and hang out, plan an excursion etc. But I find it cheap and petty to charge $12.95 for wireless internet access in rooms. For a hotel where room rates are generally in the $250 range, wireless internet, which is ridiculously cheap to provide is not something a hotel like Westin should be nickel and diming people for. This is absurd and the primary reason I did not give the hotel 5 stars. I shouldn't have to pay $13 a day to occasionally check e-mail in my room. Many other chains, including quite a few more affordable ones provide free wireless in rooms. Its almost an industry standard at this point. I would think that being a gold member would at least by me that courtesy. In fact I have no idea what additional benefits I was supposed to be enjoying over regular guests, because I detected none. Checkin was fairly quick and simple and we were headed to our rooms just minutes after arriving. There is a Starbucks in the lobby if you like that. Unfortunately, being a newer area, there is not a lot in the area for restaurants and bars unless you are willing to walk at least half a mile or so. There is a bus stop across the street that is supposed to be on the silver line to the T station but we could never figure out when it came. We stood waiting one day for about half hour before moving on. There is a station a little further walk from the hotel where we were able to get the bus but its almost less hassle to just walk 3/4 of a mile down Summer st to the South Station and from there you can go pretty much anywhere. Hotel pool was very nice and a big hit with my kids. There is also a jacuzzi there for adults. No diving though, pool is fairly short and not deep, less than 5 feet I believe. Overall I would rate our stay at the hotel fairly high. Pros: spacious comfortable rooms, nice HD TV, quiet AC system and decent city view, polite service. Cons: $$$ to park on site, $13/day for in room internet, restaurant a bit pricey, not much to do in immediate area. Also walls are a bit thin. I would expect better sound dampening in a chain like the Westin. I could hear every door slam on the floor. Fortunately there were not many of them. I might be inclined to stay at the Westin more often if they would just build some of these bogus charges into the room rate and stop hacking people (especially gold members) for things like parking and internet.

My friend and I stayed at the Westin Waterfront, Boston to attend a conference in March. At first blush, this hotel looks like a 4-5 start, just by the design and ambiance of the lobby/reception area. It's not. Let's start with the good.... We had a comfortable room with 2 queen sized beds on the 15th floor. Long, long way from the elevators. Odd design that there are not 2 banks of elevators because of this. Our room was comfortable, but somehwat old and tired looking. The drapes are increadibly drab as are the lighting fixtures. Honestly, it looked like they came out of a hotel auction or liquidation somewhere else and were brought here. Tsk. The 'heavenly bed' was indeed, heavenly. I love that about Westin Hotels. The Lobby area was comfortable and bar service there was adequate. They were run off their feet with a couple of different conferences, so sometimes it was necessary to go to the Bar directly just to get a glass of wine. However, the staff there were very friendly. The Concierge staff. For the most part these people were helpful. We wanted to take a Trolley tour of Boston. My friend had a specific company's brochure in hand (which she got from a concierge) and asked where we could catch the trolley. On a cold, cold and blowy morning, we were directed by this woman (with a Hawaiin sounding name) out onto the street infront of the hotel, to wait for it. It didn't come and didn't come and didn't come.... As the hour was nearing end, one of these trolleys appeared and instead of coming to where we were told to stand, it swung up into the curved driveway of the hotel to pick up at the lobby! Yikes! We ran for it and caught it. The Trolley driver says this is the regular pickup point. And yes, when we returned back to the hotel, this indeed was where he dropped us off. Hmmmm...... Services and amenities. Finding out about what the hotel had to offer was almost impossible. We had expected a brochure or book in the room to give us the overview. There was a standardized booklet (similar in all Westins) that served as a room service menu and very, very brief overview of the hotel services. It was more like a directory. And, the binding was broken. We searched every nook and cranny but couldn't find anything else. There was nothing big or bold to encourage us to go to any restaurants (and no mention of where these were even located in the hotel), shops or even the pool. The only reason I knew there was a pool at all is because the Westin Waterfront's website showed one! Couldn't see any signage anywhere in the hotel, and a lady on the elevator told us where it was. She said it was small and since there were alot of people in the hotel, crowded. We skipped it. My friend had breakfast once in the lobby restaurant. She found the staff incredibly pleasant, courteous and helpful. Her Eggs Benedict \"were perfect\". We checked out the Room Service menu. Wow, the prices were really, really over-inflated. Take a look at the fine print for tip included, room service tax and everything else on top of the bad prices. Housekeeping: now this is an issue. While our rooms were tidied every day (we were there for 3), there was no real evidence of cleaning. A reviewer of this hotel commented that he had all of the amenties such as mouthwash and shampoo restocked daily. We did not. WE didn't even see a little mouthwash bottle. We had 1 bottle of shampoo and 1 of conditioner for our entire visit. I wonder what else there is supposed to be? (Remember, I've stayed in other Westins and I did expect more of many things besides this than I found at this hotel) . I did find the housekeeping staff in the hall one morning and asked if I could have a couple of packets of decaffinated tea put in the room. She said the Westin doesn't have decaff tea. I pointed out there was 1 pack in the room right at that moment and she said 'oh', shed' look into it. She did not. No other packets appeared. I am attaching some photos of our sidetable between the beds and the bathroom floor under the sink. Never cleaned. Notice the thick dust on the bedside table and desk. Notice the abundance of hair under the sink. I called around 3:30 on our second day to get this remedied and specifically asked that someone sweep the bathroom floor. When we returned 4 hours later, dusting in the bedroom area had been done. The bathroom floor had not been swept. I called again at 7:30 pm and was told 'we'll have someone from housekeeping right up.\" We went to bed around 10 and no one had shown up! (please see attached). The lack of service was significant and by the 3rd day, we stopped leaving a tip! A reviewer in January 2010 noted that the hotel had a free shuttle downtown and back. Never heard of it. Never saw it. We did catch a shuttle once, along with some other hotel guests. A large crowd of guests was standing outside the lobby, in line for taxis when a shuttle driver came and asked us if we'd like a lift into town. About 7 of us took him up on it. $5.00 per person. No mention of his being part of the hotel No uniform, either. Hmmm..... Location: good. EAsy access to the heart of Boston. Not much around the area of the hotel, though. There's a lot of development going on nearby, so this may change. We wanted to do a lot of sightseeing between conference sessions and had expected a number of sightseeing books/guides to be in our hotel room. No such thing. We had to go to the lobby to find this. I wonder why? Other hotels, including other Westins have these 'What to do in this city'-type books in their rooms. Why not this one? Just a last comment: I tried to call this hotel to inform them of a late arrival. This was the most frustrating process! I called the 1-800 number and got reservations for ALL WEstin hotels. Then they put me through to another number of the same type. It was like pulling teeth to get anyone to give me a direct number for the Westin Waterfront in Boston. I even tried their listed numbers on the internet. Somehow someone would answer and switch me to the 'main' Westin numbers. UGH! I hope Westin Waterfront can fix this hassle.

Location: The thing is, I understand what some other reviewers have said--in spite of the somewhat condescending management reponses here on Tripadvisor that this is an up-and-coming area, there's not a lot in the immediate vicinity. BUT...Boston's transit is the easiest I've encountered in quite some time. The Silver Line bus from the airport got me to the hotel within scant minutes of exiting the airport. The station is a mere 500 feet from the hotel's doorstep. Then, throughout the week, I was a very short ride to the South Station and a couple of transfers to anywhere in Boston that I wanted to go. This city is so compact that there's nowhere you can't get in very short order. The room/housekeeping: Perfectly arranged and very well-kept. The Heavenly Bed, as usual, lived up to its name. I did have a corner room at the quietest end of the hallway (Room 1264), and perhaps that does help with noise. Environmental controls worked well. Housekeeping was flawless every single day of my stay; everything was replenished as it should have been, and a few toiletries even extra--I loved that there was mouthwash, for instance. Many hotels don't do that anymore. Also, the Africa Kitamu Starbucks coffee was great. The facilities: Like many large convention facilities, there is nickel-and-diming if you allow it. In-room Internet is $12.95. BUT--there is free WiFi in the lobby, and it works great. Also, there is a real--not hotel franchised--Starbucks in the lobby with non-gouge pricing. :) I have a weakness for the lemon pound cake, and it was just $1.85. The restaurants are pricey as well, and room service is crazy outrageous even for a hotel of this caliber, but using the aforementioned transportation, I was able to eat well in town for a lot less. If you haven't tried it, go to the food court at Quincy Market/Fanueil Hall. Great choices at great prices! Also, there is a Domino's location close by that delivers to the hotel. I took advantage of that one evening as well. The lobby itself is very pleasant, and there are lots of seating areas for conversation/meeting. The Mezzanine has great long divans with outlets next to them for utilizing that aforementioned free wifi. All in all, I have absolutely nothing to complain about.

Went to top floor to use the ice machine there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c another 9 floors up. And it went downhill from there\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. We were walking back to the Hotel after doing Boston First Night. It had been a long night, and we were very much looking forward to a draft beer and something to eat in the bar. Along comes 2 police cars with sirens blaring pulling into the hotel. Then come 2 more police cars. We get to the hotel and try to get into the bar. We find the outside entrance closed. OK, so we go into the lobby and try to get into the bar through the lobby entrance. The hostess says the bar was closed for a private party. Plus she says that they closed at 11 pm anyway. Let me get this straight: There are no bars anywhere around the hotel to be seen. You have a hotel FULL of people (not to mention 2 in-house weddings that night too). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve, AND YOU CLOSE YOUR HOTEL BAR/RESTAURANT FOR A PRIVATE PARTY ?!?!?!? ARE YOU KIDDING ME ?!?!?! And to top it off, the private party is the reason for the police. An altercation broke out among a few of the private party members, serious enough to require 4 cruisers. There is another tiny bar in the lobby, but all it has is a tiny counter that can only fit about 10-15 people. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full. Alright, guess it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room service or nothing. We go back to the room, and there is no room service menu. We call, they say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the back of a booklet on the credenza. We have the booklet, but the menu is missing. They say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll send one up. Figuring this is gonna be a while, I try going down to front desk to get one. After searching, the desk person says he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find one. Back to the room and we call room service again. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re 5th in line for a person to come up to the room to deliver the menu! Finally, I had her read the menu over the phone and I placed an order, and mention to them all that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened and how long we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been waiting. TO THEIR CREDIT, order arrived very quickly. And then there is the $42 parking !! In all fairness, this is one bad experience.

The Hotel is beautiful. The lobby is very clean and modern and decorated beautifully. There is a bar in the lobby, along with the entrance to two of the hotel's restaurants: O'Connor's (with was GREAT) and another open only for breakfast, which we did not try. The front desk service was very good and the concierge was exceptional. He got us reservations for two very nice restaurants with very little notice, and got us great tables as well! The rooms are nicely furnished, and the beds very comfortable. However, we had a king bed in our room, and there was another smaller bed (almost a cot) in our room that did nothing but take up space. The workout room and pool were wonderful... The hotel provides a free shuttle into center city near most of the restaurants and shopping, which was convenient, and there are always taxi's waiting outside as well.. The hotel is not that far from center city, and it was not a big deal for us. The only complaint that I have, was the parking. There is an underground lot that you can park in, however, the gate never worked and was a pain to get in an out. On busy weekends, we were there over New Years (aka \"First Night\" in Boston), and it was full. They also charge $32 per night for parking, which is outrageous in my opinion if you are paying good money for the hotel. Drinks out of the minifridge is expected to be expensive, but they charge the same price at the bar downstairs which was a turnoff as well. The walls are also thin and you can here everything going on in the hallways and adjacent rooms.

It wasn't worth complaining about, but it was annoying. But I did get charged for 3 days of parking, which had to be corrected. - And my company wanted to pre-pay the bill. When I got there, I found out it hadn't happened. I contacted our travel coordinator to sort it out. She contacted the hotel. They said we had the wrong form, and they would send the right form that day. End of day, no form. She had to call and hassle them again the next day to get the right form. It didn't get fixed until just before I checked out. - I would try to contact \"Service Express\" at night to get a wakeup call. It usually took several attempts to get someone to answer the phone. - We had a free afternoon at the conference. The hotel is not particularly convenient to downtown, but touted a shuttle service into the city. Nice, I thought I'd take advantage of it. When I looked into it though, it only ran prior to 9:30 AM or after 5 PM. Not exactly convenient. - The conference I attended had mulitple breakout sessions, and the rooms assigned were consistently too small, with people standing in the back to hear. I can see this happening occasionally for a very popular session, but at this conference, it was the rule rather than the exception - $13 dollar a day for internet in a room costing well over $200 is pretty steep. And my husband and I each had a laptop with us. That was $13 EACH. - I also expected more dining options in a hotel this large, and somewhat off the beaten path.

The basic rooms are just that: basic. One large area with a king and a bathroom. No side office. The furniture and decor are very dated. The size of the televisions in the rooms would be laughable if I weren't subject to it for 4 nights. The most major reason to avoid this hotel, however, is the service. After requesting a refrigerator be brought to my room (something the amenities guide says can be provided free of charge) I was told it would be up shortly. Fast-forward six hours and finally, by the third request and statement that I had items that would spoil if it were not provided the refrigerator was brought up. An isolated incident perhaps, I thought. That is, until I spoke with my colleagues for whom three phone calls were required to obtain their room service. The lousy service permeates the entire hotel. Waiting in line for the front desk, when my turn was up and another gentleman came from nowhere and jumped in front of everybody, the service desk noticed, but did nothing and proceeded to help him.

I like the Holiday Inn Express model where it's included in the (much more reasonable) room rate. Westin's certainly not the Lone Ranger is this regard. The bed is \"heavenly\" as is the dual-head shower. Nothing like a good night's sleep. I took a taxi from Logan ($22) - and when I took a walk found that the World Trade Center station on the Silver Line is a about a two-block walk from the Westin. For a $2.00 one-way fare you can go anywhere on the system, including to/from Logan. So when I depart today, I saved my company some money. There are several Silver Line buses - and those labeled \"SL1\" will take you to Logan for that same $2 fare. Provided it's not raining (or snowing) - it's a cost effective way to go. Normally I'm doing business in Cambridge (about a $30-$35 ride), and I can get there too for the same $2 fare. So the hot tip is to pick a hotel that's reasonably close to the MBTA.

I posted a review of it - check it out - it's a fun and affordable place to get good seafood.

Despite what others have said about the concierge service here we never encountered anything but helpful staff, very friendly and willing to give directions, whatever. When we called down for the \"trolley tour\" they informed us that there was a magician on Saturday morning for the kids, very nice touch. They always said hello to us when we passed by. My daughter used the pool as well and had a blast. Although we didn't use it, the gym looked awesome. The restaurant food was pretty good, good wine by the glass selection. The rooms were comfortable, clean, roomy. Nothing to complain about there. We had a view of the water and in the distance Logan airport. I loved the staff at this hotel, I have nothing but praise for them. Really friendly and courteous! The reason we picked this hotel was b/c I could walk to the business that I was at all week, and also it was the luck of the draw on priceline @ $150 a night. Now if you know Boston, that's pretty good. Anyway, you really do have to cab it to most anywhere from this hotel. I personally didn't have the leasure to walk a couple of miles in the evening for dinner. So, we ended up taking cabs to the North End on most evenings. We only had the opportunity to take their shuttle once. Keep in mind their shuttle runs from 5pm to 7:30pm, not during the day at all. With that said, save money by staying here, but be aware that you'll have to cab it, or bus it on the silver line to catch the T. No one mentions that the silver line is a bus.

We had breakfast at the hotel. The food was ok, nothing special. The waitress we had was rather miserable and the price was average. The reception staff were very helpful and allowed us to keep our room on at no extra charge for a couple of hours which we found unusual and a nice surprise.

To be honest the Westin was not our first pick, nor was it the second, or third \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6or even the top 10, but with a week left to reserve a room before the game date it quickly became our only choice. I was surprised at not just the room prices on Boston, but also the availability or lack there of. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if it was a busy weekend, but we tried everywhere online and via telephone for a booking. I can say that there were no conventions that I was aware of during our stay. From the experience of our stay that may have changed our overall experience. After reading reviews I was a bit apprehensive as to what to expect from the place that had now become our weekend default. We are low key, no fuss family of four. The Weston is easy to find and easy to drive to. There are 4 levels of underground parking. You do not have to use valet parking. You can drive directly into the garage and self-park within steps to the elevators to the lobby. The garage was a bit of a tight fit with a full size truck. There would have been a problem if I did not have a couple of spaces to pick from. We checked in late on a Saturday and there were approximately by my count 15 spaces left. There is other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on your own\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd fee parking lots nearby and possibly some on street. There should be no parking fears here. The cost of parking for our one overnight stay was $30 and we were able to remain parked until 6pm the day of checkout. We were advised to keep our room key, swipe it and deposit it on our way out the gate. That came in handy as the game was to end sometime late in the afternoon. BTW a cab to Fenway Park from the Westin cost $15.00 Check-in process was done in reasonable time. There was a good size line when we checked in. It took about 15 minutes. The lobby however, is a great space. Plenty of seating, tastefully decorated, with a bar and a much needed albeit a more expensive Starbucks than at home. On the converse, check-out was a snap. I say that having not seen a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153final bill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with all the charges applied, hidden or otherwise. We did not require any additional services. We called the hotel directly for reservations. The room was a Double/Double 14th floor facing the Cruise terminal and the end of the Logan runways. Plenty to look at if you wish to sit and catch your breath for a few. I do wish a Queen/Queen was available for our stay. The room was well furnished in a contemporary styling, great bedding, nice carpet and window treatment. I will say the addition of flat screen televisions have made any room seem bigger and more stylish. There were plenty of channels that kept us well entertained and informed. The AC worked well although it seemed a bit loud. A steady woosh of air out of the vent was much like that of a large fan. This did cancel out most of the hallway noise that tends to be prevalent on a busy weekend, but it did not cover up the door closings or slammings as mentioned by other reviewers. Noise wise, it was far from what could be considered dead quiet. The bathroom was great. Full lighting, Kohler fixtures, double shower heads, very easy to use. As mentioned in a previous review there is no bath fan only a vent that provides natural draft venting. Skeptical I was, but it does work for odors and steam, it just may take a bit longer. There was one bathrobe in this room that was available for use. The iron in this room was broken and would not heat. The family raved about the pool and hot tub. Both were used on two separate days. Use room key to enter the pool area, towels provided there, kid friendly (parental supervision) and if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not mistaken accessible 24hrs. We decided not to eat at the restaurant in the lobby. This decision was gauged on our energy level and the appearance that it may have been too expensive for its value. Based on a few recommendations we walked (10min) to Salvatores, who but the way, serve colossal portions. Good food, well worth it and the foot traffic in the area seemed livelier than everyone has mentioned. It felt like a generally safe area. The next morning we opted for a quick bite and a latte at Starbucks instead of a sit down or eat-in breakfast. Overall I would now consider the Westin our without fault, default. Not at the airport, not near Fenway or Quincy Market BUT, we got great a value that suited our need.

She asked me to repeat myself - twice. The 3rd time I said it in a loud voice, whereupon she accused me of screaming at her. Wow, what a welcome. The room itself was spacious, clean and comfortable. There were too few hangers in the closet for 2 people, and there was only 1 bath robe. This was never addressed during our stay. We were never given a key to the mini bar, so no problems there with being billed for that. The towels were large and fluffy in the bath, but some had threads on the edges and some had holes. I use those towels at home in my rag pile; I don't put them out for guests. Amenities in the bath were pretty sparse for a luxury hotel, but the soaps were in the shape of leaves, and pretty generously sized. I loved the double shower head; my husband hated it. The maid did not clear away a used wine glass for two days, until I put a note on the glass that it was dirty. I also reduced the amount of housekeeping tip that I left that day. When she finally got the hint, I restored the full tip. Our room actually had a view of the waterfront. (We were on the 7th floor.) Admittedly, we had to look over another building and the air conditioning units of that building, but, it was a 1/4 waterfront view. We took the advice of other TripAdvisor members and did not eat in the restaurant or bar of the hotel. I stopped by the concierge's desk to ask for advice on a restaurant and how to use the business center, but the man was so rude, I gave up. One of the door men overheard the conversation and gave me directions to a great restaurant and told me that the concierge is \"full of it\" and not to take it personally. When my husband checked out and checked back in, I was out exploring and had to go to the front desk and get my key re-issued. That 2nd clerk was tremendously helpful and friendly - the only front line person that either my husband or I encountered that was friendly or helpful. The T-stop in front of the hotel is the #7, which runs to South Station, which is about a 10 minute walk. The T-stop on the other side of C Street (which runs into the Convention Center/hotel) is World Trade Center, which takes you to the airport for $2. There is a Dunkin' Donuts on Summer Street, which runs in front of the hotel on the way to South Station, about a 5 minute walk away. Also a convenience store open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. at Melcher, along that route. There is a 7-11 on the other side of the C Street bridge, closer to the waterfront. For fast food, South Station has plenty of food. For restaurants, I tried LTK (Legal Test Kitchens) which was very trendy but superb. We also walked up to the North End and tried Cantina Italiana, which makes all of their own pasta and their own sangria. A little pricey, but I can see why families eat there - the leftovers would feed the family for the rest of the week! I liked the suggestion from another TripAdvisor member about the Walk Boston website, as it shows approximate walking times from point to point in Boston. This location is so far away from anything that you either have to walk or take a cab to get to the tourist sites or a decent restaurant. I'm a big walker, so a 1/2 hour walk up to the North End doesn't bother me. (Don't walk the other direction into South Boston!) Overnight parking is up to $41, by the way, which is a major reason that I rented a car for one day and took Greyhound for my day trip the next day. I arranged my rental car ahead of time (Enterprise) and had them meet me at the hotel early in the morning. (Concierge was affronted when the rental person came in and he found out that I had arranged the rental without him! See other reviews as to why I preplanned.) I could leave the rental car there without having to pay the parking fee when I came back at the end of the day. (Although it is good form to tip the doorman when they move the car to the overnight parking area.) Gas is more expensive in the Boston metro area and there are no gas stations near the hotel, so factor that in when planning a car rental. There are lots and lots of free overnight parking spots on the bridge on Summer Street, a couple minute's walk from the hotel, but do read the signs about which side of the street gets cleaned on which nights. We did not get charged extra for our USA Today copy. For as much money as was paid for this room, you'd think that we'd at least get courtesy, direction to the elevators or a pretense at a smile. Even at a Super 8 we get a free breakfast. Other places have manager's receptions in the evenings.

We were not worried about the proximity to downtown and thought this would be a great place to stay as our home base. We traveled to Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut and Rhode Island. The hotel served to be a perfect place to jump onto the highways and avoid the big city. We did take a few drives downtown but the streets are insanely confusing and the crowds are out of control. (And don't bother asking any locals or the valet for directions. Everyone is clueless!!!!!) We went to Fenway Park for ALCS Game 4 and found it easier to take a cab. It was about $20 each way with tip. Parking by the stadium was $40 so it was worth the convenience. If you want to drive downtown to park and have dinner most places charge about $20. So that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little maddening. But to be honest there were very few restaurants there worth checking out. PF Changs & Cheese Cake Factory are the best but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also available if you take a drive outside the big city. We found solace in Medford. Grocery shopping at Super Stop and Shop, Subway, Chipotle, Bertucci\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The other way dowards Dedham we found Target, Old Navy, Five Guys Burgers & Fries. The rooms were comfortable. I had a 14th floor room overlooking the waterfront. A lovely view. The bed was wonderful & the rooms were VERY Clean which was a blessing. The tub was sparkling and even the grout was perfect. Good job housekeeping. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were it stops. My poor husband went to pull the towel off the rack our 2nd night and there were splotches of stuff all over it. Either vomit or blood. NASTY. I called housekeeping and they came and picked up the towel to see our concern and said they'd refresh the towels. (Duh, they were all used anyway!) I had my baseball tickets sent to the hotel and they charged me $10 for the courtesy of signing for me. By the way they never told me that until I got my bill!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!! They charge you $5 to use the computer in the business center and $1.50 per page to print. I was told that they do this because this is a convention center and run by an independent company. Valet is $41 and run by the city. (But that is clearly posted). Finally my room had bar charges that were posted to my room that were not ours. When we went to dispute the $10 & the bar charges, we were refunded the bar but the $10 was left because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they could do nothing about it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I went back later and spoke to a manager and he took it off. I was pretty ticked that this hotel has no amenities for the SPG Gold members. I have stayed dozens of times at SPG properties over the years and have never been nickel and dimed like that before. Bottom line: The hotel is clean, comfortable and conveniently located just outside downtown and if you have a car, a great place to jump on highways. Be prepared to be charged for every little thing because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a convention center and apparently it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s normal protocol for those types of facilities.

Being on a budget I was unhappy with the number of extra fees. The worst one was $31 a day to park your car in the garage. In that area of Boston there is no street parking, and with the cheapest room being around $300/night I think they could have included parking with the room rate. Another fee that I was surprised to find was the fee to connect to the Wi-Fi. I stayed at a Holiday Inn Express (which was about $100 a night) a couple months ago, and free Wi-Fi in ever room. Again, it is an amenity that is advertised on their website to attract customers, but there is a huge charge for the service. In room movies were $9 each, again, at the Holiday Inn they were around $5 or $6. Maybe, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just because I am used to travelling on a budget and if you have big bucks you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind spending them\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but I was just disappointed, I thought that for a higher price more amenities would be included, not less.

I often got transferred around on the phone line trying to figure out who I needed to talk to get an answer about certain questions I had\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and I feel as if the woman who checked me in was just plain snobby. No one offered to help me with my bags or get a baggage cart; they said that they only offer that if you pay for the valet parking. I enjoyed the large hotel and the comfortable room, it was a long walk to the garage to get your car, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a difficult part of Boston to navigate anyway. I am originally from about 20 miles north of there, but I got lost several times. It is not really close to very many attractions...or at least not close enough to walk; you would have to take a cab. There is the Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Museum, The New England Aquarium, and The Science Museum, but again, not within walking distance (especially if you have children); there is a T station about \u00c2\u00bd to \u00c2\u00be of a mile away. The hotel is huge and very open. And I think poorly designed; I want to be able to go down to the gym or pool and just run into hotel staff and guests, not everyone getting a coffee at the Starbucks on the way to work, taking a date to dinner at the expensive restaurant, or going out of overpriced martinis at one of the two bars at the hotel. I also got lost in the hotel several times. Getting in and out of the garage was also an issue\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit is not at all marked and often when you see an exit sign it is an exit for a person and not a vehicle.

We researched a few hotels before we traveled to Boston and everytime we made our hike past the Longham we wished we'd booke there instead. Also, the subway/bus/public transit system connects near the hotel, but it is a real pain to navigate and you have to pretty much switch trains at every stop to get where you are going from here.

We booked our trip along with airfare through Travelocity Last Minute trips. Because of this, I can't exactly say how much we paid for our room at the Westin -- we chose it soley on it being a 'luxury' hotel and because of the 'Heavenly Bed'. That said, this Westin is definitely beautiful although I wouldn't exactly call it 'waterfront'. We took a water taxi over from Logan International Airport, just for the fun of it ($10/per person vs. $2/per person on the subway). We though we'd be getting off of the water taxi and strolling a block to the hotel. More like hiking about 4 huge city blocks. Folks, it is soooooooooo not on the waterfront! Just fyi. It wasn't the end of the world but kind of a surprise. The lobby was very zen-like with tall birch trees (yes, in the lobby) and modern furnishings. We arrived at 11am and decided to stop in to see if we could check in early. No problem, they had a room ready. That was really nice since that prevented us from lugging our bags all around town for most of the day. The check in was smooth. The clerk asked us if we wanted the key to our minibar but we declined knowing we could spend a fortune if we had it in our posession. Our room was a king size bed, city view room on the 11th floor. We had a great sweeping view of Boston and a partial view of the harbor. Very nice. The room was clean and cool. The bed was covered in bright white linens and the furniture was dark wood. Nice wide flatscreen TV. No clutter. Masculine, modern, very swanky. The only problem we had early on was a complete abscense of toiletries --- no soaps, shampoo, lotion, etc. I called the Service Express folks and asked for 'toiletries'. Perhaps it was my mistake because, although there was a delivery made in around 15 minutes, they delivered a plastic bag filled with razors, q-tips, cotton balls,mini combs, toothpaste/brush, nail polish remover. No soap, no shampoo. We called for those items specifically when we returned that night. We also only had one robe, no slippers and the water was loud when the folks above us ran theirs. Alas, all of that was minor and made no real impact on our enjoyment of the hotel. We ordered room service twice. Everything was excellent. Totally overpriced with a $3.50 'delivery charge' plus 18% gratuity and a 5% sales tax. Outrageous but that didn't stop us because, well, room service is such a treat! Breakfast was wonderful and we'd order it all over again :) Oh, the bed --- absolutely 100% heavenly. It was awesome. We skipped going out our second night to stay in, rent a movie and drink beers in that bed. It was that good. The hotel's location is convenient to the subway stop at the World Trade Center. One trip on the subway is only $2. Don't make the silly mistake we did and take a taxi to the Sam Adams Brewery in Jamaica Plain. There is a subway stop just about 3 smaller city blocks from this brewery. Also, Boston is very 'walkable' and we did alot of it. There is even a website called Walk Boston that has maps letting you know how many minutes it takes to walk all over town. That said, this particular hotel is away from the center of the city action so if that is what you like, this isn't the one for you. We would stay here again as it was a beautiful hotel with really comfortable beds, great water pressure (forgot to mention that!) and helpful staff.

The facilities are by far the high point. Our room was spacious, clean, attractive, and modern with comfortable beds. The bathroom was larger than expected, well-lit, and very tastefully decorated, with a Heavenly Shower that lived up to its name. The hotel lobby is active, beautifully decorated, and welcoming, with lots of places to sit and enjoy the natural light coming in through the large lobby windows. We worked out at the gym and found it to be well-equipped for our needs. The indoor pool is next door to the gym, and the guests we saw swimming (mostly families) seemed to be enjoying themselves. Though the location appears to be in a growing part of the city that is being renovated -- lots of construction in the area -- we didn't find it to be an unappealing location. There are some decent restaurants within walking distance, and a reasonable cab ride took us to Fenway (we were in the city to see a game there). It would probably be a less appealing location for folks who wish to do lots of walking to plentiful retail outlets and fun tourist attractions. To us, the unappealing part of the hotel was something some other folks have referenced in their reviews -- the lack of \"can-do\" attitudes and customer service-focus in some of the employees. The restaurant is a good example -- it offers a breakfast buffet which is fairly tasty (but not cheap), but, alas, both days that we ate there, we noticed that there just weren't enough servers for all the tables and very few workers bussing tables. Tables sat with huge piles of plates on them for periods of 20 minutes or longer while other diners patiently waited for seating. Other tables remained empty altogether for long periods of time (maybe the staffing for those tables was not available?). However, the hostess stand was packed with people eager to eat (we noticed about 50 people, in addition to us, waiting to get in the restaurant, and that size crowd continued the whole time we ate). Some were frustrated that they had been told the wait was 15 minutes then had to wait 30-45 minutes. Some people left before their parties were called for seating. Meanwhile, I saw two restaurants employees in the dining room reading magazines and looking bored while guests buzzed about them, looking for help (maybe the employees were on break, but they were burning time in plain view of all the guests -- not very professional looking on break or not on break). Both mornings in the restaurant we saw these same kinds of sights. We wondered aloud how much more money the restaurant would be making with some new management on the scene and theorized that it would be a huge increase in revenue with some new direction. The whole scene just lacked efficiency and direction on the management front. The servers looked frustrated and harried. We also encountered the lack of customer service approach when it came to things like valet service, waiting about 35 minutes to get our car. When we asked two other employees out front if they could please help us track down our car, they all seemed to want to try to avoid doing any additional work. No one said they would check on it for us and see if the car had been picked up yet. Instead, they all said, \"I'm sure it's on the way,\" and declined to take any responsibility for researching the situation. That was frustrating, as we had flights to catch and the time window was getting tighter and tighter, particularly for my flight, as we waited. I ended up bailing out and got a cab to the airport, due to time panic, and my friends continued to wait for the car. (I did make my flight, which was good! :) ) We did encounter an especially friendly, attentive bartender (I wish I had gotten his name) who seemed to take pride in his job and made us feel valued as customers. But I can't recall another employee who was as customer-service oriented. It's such a beautiful hotel -- it's a shame that the staffing/management part of things isn't as good as the facilities. I think we'll choose another hotel in Boston next time.

Hotel brochure also advertises \"service express\" services including diapers and wipes if you run out - we did, and when we called service express they said none were currently available, of any size (so we drove into the city to pick some up). Surprised to hear about the complimentary shuttle into the city as this was certainly not mentioned to us, we were directed to use a taxi to get to Faneuil Hall. Tried out the restaurant for (an after dinner) dessert and it was terrible - staff would not bring some hot water for baby bottle to be heated but rather insisted that they take the bottle away. Wait staff could not answer questions on the food. In addition, food not great. We ordered decaf coffees and got caffeinated, even though we asked several times to make sure that they were decaf. The (caffeinated) latte that was delivered, arrived as a shot of espresso with a pot of cold milk! Tea was delivered in a teapot that could not be opened to add the teabag - it felt as if we were there all night sorting out simple things, when we just wanted a quick convenient dessert while the kids were being calm before bed.

I have to admit, I booked the hotel because I got an excellent rate from The Westin's website ($190/night before taxES) but was nervous after reading some of the reviews here. The hotel really wasn't bad at all. We had no probs with the concierge (called for an extra robe and got 2 within 10 minutes) and check in was fast. Parking will cost you $31/day but you do get access until 6pm the day of your check out. We were on the 4th floor with a bad view but didn't care because we arrived at the hotel an hour early - didn't feel like waiting an hour plus for a room on a higher floor. Would have been able to get one if willing to wait. Yes we could hear water running from a neighboring shower (once) and heard some doors slam, but you can't expect complete silence - at least I don't - when in a hotel. My only complaint/disappointment was that I felt like our room was cleaned on the fly - like towels looked like they were quickly folded and thrown on the rack. I just expected a bit more care from a Westin. But other than that, great, comfy bed and awesome shower. Room was pretty updated, including an LCD tv. Drinks at the bar/hotel food was extremely overpriced though, so beware. I suggest you get your morning coffee at one of the hundreds of Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts throughout the city - the hotel Starbuck will rob you blind. The location wasn't a problem for us at all. In fact, we used the Old Town Trolley one day to sightsee and one of it's stops was actually right at the hotel. We did a lot of walking but Boston is a VERY walkable city. I didn't mind walking although the weather will play a big factor in that decision. Cabs are a bit pricey IMO but the subway is also a good option for longer distances. Didn't take the subway to/from hotel so not exactly sure of the closest T stop, but I think it's within 2 or 3 blocks. You're not going to walk out of the hotel and be smack in the middle of the city so if that's a must for you, be sure to check out more centrally located hotels.

The hotel lobby was very nicely done - large but withouth that convention-like feel that some large hotel lobbies project. Check-in went smoothly and the clerk was very accomodating. Priceline does not guarantee two beds and the clerk went out of his way to find us a double bedded room with a connecting king (I booked two rooms). The rooms themselves were a nice size. They were long but I do wish they were a bit wider from bed to dresser. However, they were very clean and the bathroom was a nice size. The beds were comfy and for there were plenty of pillows on it which I like. There was a flat screen tv and internet service was available for $12.95 a night. Most hotels do not charge for internet access anymore and most even offer wireless access. The bathroom was large and clean. The main problem I had with this hotel was its location. Of course, I knew before I arrived that it was not what I would consider centrally located. It is located near public transportation but it is a good 20 minute walk into Boston proper minimum depending on where you want to go. We were six people and it didn't even pay for us to take public transportation. We drove into Boston and paid for parking. This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel and I hate to sound spoiled but there were just lots of little glitches that I don't usually encounter in hotels of lesser quality. First, the hotel clerk didn't properly activate our room key to give us egress out of the garage so that we got stuck by the exit and had to call upstairs for help. Took a bit of time and then we had to stand in line and have the card activated for a second time. Then our toilet stopped working. Luckily, it was just before we left the room and so we called the front desk and the toilet was fixed when we got back hours later. I have no idea how long it took for a worker to come in and fix the toilet but it could have been a problem if the toilet had broken down late afternoon or during evening hours. When I got my bill, I was charged for a purchase from the honor bar despite the fact that I didn't even have the key for it. I was also charged for the second room -several hundred dollars- even though Priceline makes you pay in full when the room is booked. Hopefully, the problem was rectified at the front desk when I checked out but I won't know for sure until I get my bill. Also, each room is supposed to have a robe but one of my rooms didn't. No big deal but I have a sneaking suspicion that I may end up charged for it even though I informed the hotel clerk that I didn't take it home with me but that it was never in the room to begin with. I just think a four star hotel shouldn't make these kind of mistakes.

So in summary yes its in a new area still lacking amenities, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good modern hotel ideal for business, maybe less so for holidaymakers who might be better off in Cambridge or the back bay", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, could have free wireless!\u201d", "Author": "disgrun", "ReviewID": "UR15140073", "Content": "Getting to the Westin is easy- take a cab, or take the Silver Line bus from Logan Airport ($2, pay in exact bills to the driver or get a ticket in the arrivals hall before going to the bus stop) to the World Trade Centre. There, follow the signs to the Westin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the walk is about 5 mins across a walkway, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth it, as you get a great skyline view of Boston. The World Trade Centre is the first stop from Logan, and takes about 3-4 minutes to get to. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much better value than a cab, and Silver Line buses are very frequent. With a hotel of this class and price though, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have expected a shuttle bus to the airport. The Westin is a very well-appointed hotel, and I really enjoyed staying there. Check-in was fast and painless, and staff was friendly. The room was clean and of a good size, and the bathroom was great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the best part being the double power-shower, which was wonderful in the morning. The room came with a TV (annoyingly, the default setting was to go to pay-per-view), and a coffee machine. A good touch was the Starbucks coffee in the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a choice of African roast or mixed blend. Having a decaf option would also have been welcome. The room service was, as noted by other reviewers here, generally ok but sporadic. I stayed six nights and some days the coffee wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t replaced; some days the shampoo was not replaced;\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and a rubber thing which was lying on the ground when I got to this Westin was not hovered up during my stay there. I think this probably had to do with low staff numbers rather than staff quality - throughout my stay I was surprised by how few service staff there was on the floors. Hotels already pay service staff very little - they could employ a few more and get standards up. Fast internet is available in the rooms. This is $9.95 for a 24-hr period, or around $5 for 30 minutes. Go figure. There is free wireless access in the lobby, although staff told me \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcit might not work\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Again, for a hotel this price, providing free wireless would be a good thing. The hotel has 2 bars, both in the lobby. The main bar is in the Sauciety eatery. The food is expensive ($10 for a tasty but simple salad), as are the drinks ($5-6.50 for a beer, $14 and above for a cocktail if I remember correctly), but the barman was very good and friendly and the atmosphere chilled out. There is a Starbucks in the lobby, and the cakes there are fairly inexpensive ($2.26 on average), but the coffee is going towards $4. There are some restaurants on D Street near the hotel, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try these. I was recommended a restaurant called Salvatore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the street, a few minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk from the hotel. Getting into Boston is easy, but takes a little bit of time. You can either take a cab, or the Silver Line from the World Trade Centre, or, as I did, walk 5-10 minutes to South Station and take the T or the commuter rail from there. The walk is scenic (skyline views) but may be cold in the winter. Again, this is where a hotel shuttle bus would be very useful! If you have time, you can walk straight into the financial district in about 20-25 minutes from the hotel. The swimming pool was ok, very chlorinated and to a good size. The fitness room was also good. A good touch were the changing rooms with lockers and stacks of available towels. If you have children, the swimming pool has no lifeguard, so it is not a place to let them swim on their own.", "Date": "April 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Various, UK, Aus, NZ, HK", "Title": "\u201cGood location for airport\u201d", "Author": "fairhsa", "ReviewID": "UR15035051", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for one night prior to a flight out of Boston, just because it was close to the airport. Although the hotel itself does not offer any airport transportation, the silverline MBTA bus does go from a short distance from the hotel, direct to the airport, for USD2. It took around 10 minutes. This was the best bit of the hotel. Other than this, my stay was pretty ordinary. As a platinum starwoods member I am entitled to a suite (if available) on checkin - I did get this, although it was just two rooms with an adjoining door and the door was locked when I got to the room so I could not access the other room! They came and unlocked the door but it would not stay open, so I had to ring again for a door stop, which came eventually. No other benefits for platinum so anyone expecting free internet (unlike the copely place westin) or free breakfast (unlike the properties with lounges) will be disappointed. The pool is ok but not as nice as the photos. Gym is ok. Did not try the food. The hotel is very new and shiney - if you like that sort of thing you might like this hotel. I found it somewhat sterile and impersonal. Reception staff were ok but not great, the concierge was extremely rude - when reception told me about the airport bus, they said the concierge would know the timetable... well, she did not and said \"how should I know\" when I asked! Amazing. The bed is the standard westin bed - you either love or hate these beds. The bathroom (in both of my rooms) was small and pokey, with a shower-over-the-bath affair which is odd for a suite.

At the same time, my husband called the Westin from our home to request that security go to the room and wait with her until I got there. It took me 15 minutes to get dressed and drive to the hotel to pick her up, and I got to her room before the security guard. Thank god her injury was not life-threatening. In addition, it took the hotel 2 full days to contact my mom to see how she was doing after her fall, even after we spoke to one of the managers.

One, or possibly even two, of these by themselves could lead one to believe it was an isolated bad experience. However, if you read on you will see that lack of customer service, cleanliness and satisfaction is an issue of severity with this property. I arrived in Boston on a red-eye and contacted the hotel at noon to see if I could get an early check in and if my room was available. I was informed it was ready so I took a diverted from a friends house to the hotel. Upon arrival, I was told the room was not ready and it would be 1-2 hours. They seemed unconcerned that I was told otherwise on the phone. When I asked for a member of management, they informed me there was nothing that could be done. They did offer their Fitness Facility as an option for me to shower since I had just got in from a red-eye. I politely turned down the use of a public shower. Not the answer you'd expect from a Westin. The room was moderately clean. There was hair in the bathtub and the robe hanger was there with a Westin Note to \"enjoy\" the robe, but no robe on the hanger. Lastly, there was no cups in the room. I phoned down and asked for a wine menu and was told one would be sent up. 2 hours later and 3 phone calls reminding them, I received it. One moring they houskeeping staff arrived at 8:30am to service the room. I asked if they could come back. At 2:00pm I had to ask the front desk to have the room cleaned, because they had forgot to come back. There is nothing within walking distance of this hotel (bar, food, full service gym - nothing). You have to take a taxi to go anywhere. If it's not bad enough you are stranded at the hotel, but there is only one restaurant on the property. The one and only restaurant on the property is perhaps the worst issue with the hotel. I was there for 3 days and had to eat 3 meals there. You had to request for a wait staff to take your order. Drinks were not refilled. The order was wrong. There were other tables asking to speak to the manager regarding their service as well. On the lighter side, they did discount 2 of my 3 meals because of the obvious customer service and order accuracy issues. To sum it up, the Waterfront Westin (That really isn't water front, but is viewable from the water) is a nice hotel - physically. The location and staff are what make this a hotel to avoid.

Next day, we came down to information booth. Another extremely long wait to ask for information of how to get around in Boston. It was a long line and once again with only 1 person to help. We booked the trolly for $32 per person. My advise, don't bother to book at the hotel. Get onto the trolly and then you can pay them later when they get to the 2nd stop at the Aquarium. You can also get a discount there. The only convenient thing about staying at this hotel is that you can catch the trolly right at the front door. In room service is extremely expensive. We ordered in room service breakfast for a wooping $30 for only 1 person which include 2 eggs, 2 bacons, potato, 2 toasts and 1 glass of orange juice. So stay away from ordering breakfast. There is a convenient store 7 Eleven & Dunkin Donuts right down one block from the Hotel. For dining, strongly suggested the Barking Crab. Very affordable with good food. Also, if you have a chance, go to China Town which cost about $7 each way by taxi for some cheap, good food. We went to a dinner at Antony Pier 4. What a waste of money? The food was plain and the price is extremely expensive. A large lobster (about 2 pounds) for $55 and a sole for $30. If you willing to spend a lot of money for dinner with horrible service.

There was a lot of wind and rainstorms during my stay in Boston so weather was not conducive to walking around. My husband and daughter (4 years old) came w/ me on this business trip.

Good alternative to eating at the only restaurant at the hotel, Sauciety. 3) Indoor Pool -- for my daughter who loves to swim 4) Proximity to the Conference & airport-- as I was attending a conference there. Things we did not like: 1) Location is a bummer if you are a leisure traveler trying to experience Boston -- This is not really Boston, it's South Boston, parts of which are still really rough neighborhood. Not a good place to walk around even if weather cooperated. Kind of a bummer for my family that was there for leisure. 2) Very few restaurants around -- so you are sort of tied to the one restaurant on the premise. We did go and try the Legal Test Kitchen (5 min cab ride and probably within walking distance) -- which was fabulous. But food is a little expensive if you have to eat all your meals at the hotel 3) Service is not quite there.

Really loud and there was something wrong w/ the temperature control in the room and it was so hot. Next morning, I changed to a couple floors down and I didn't have the noise or temperature issues.

Then why did this property leave me cold? Only two reasons, really, and maybe it was just timing. 1. The check-in was very perfunctory, not the warm greeting I have received at other Boston hotels in the same price category. In fact, I have not had a hotel stay in recent memory - and I travel a lot - during which I felt as anonymous and invisible as I did here. The staff needs to be trained on service points - especially the doormen. 2. Although the lobby and room were nice, what's with the hallways? So drearily decorated, it was depressing - I kid you not - walking back and forth to and from the room. Olive drab to the nth degree - literally. Would I come back? Yes, for the Starwood points, as the other (and much better) Westin in Boston has become wildly expensive and my company doesn't let us stay there anymore.

The \"Service Plus\" line on the in-room phone went unanswered on three occasions and when I finally got a staff-person they were also clearly disinterested in helping.

Initially we were disappointed in not being able to find a hotel at a central location due to the Marathon, but the hotel was so nice that it made the distance factor a mute point. The hotel is large (about 800 rooms), sleek and modern. The lobby is dramatic and was pleasantly filled (even at 10:30 at night) with people socializing. Check-in was a snap, in spite of the fact that the hotel was totally sold out. Our rooms were spanking clean, modern and roomy. Our bed was wonderfully comfortable, so much so that my husband, who is usually a very early riser, slept until 9:30 the next morning. We had a huge flat screen tv, Starbucks coffee and tea for the coffee maker and a variety of ultra-modern conveniences. Our bathroom was roomy and modern and had beautiful granite countertops and a stone floor. The pool, which we did not have the time to use, looked beautiful. There was a Starbucks in the lobby. Check-out was also very easy. The employees were polite and helpful, including after putting our two sons in a room with a king sized bed rather than two doubles as requested. They were conscientious about security and insisted that I come down to the registration desk to identify my sons. I appreciated this detail, despite the fact that it required I get redressed, after a recent experience in a luxury hotel where I was offered a friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room key by a hotel employee when she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t answer her room phone.

The rooms look exactly as pictured on the site - very modern and comfortable. The bathrooms are a nice size, slate floor and granite countertop. The room was pretty clean - and I am very, very picky about cleanliness. We did notice that the walls are a bit thin -- meaning if your room is quiet (i.e., you're trying to sleep) and someone in the room next to you is watching TV, talking or flushing the toilet -- you can hear it. There were also a lot of kids on our floor that were incapable of walking from the elevator to their room, so they ran. Sprinted. Needless to say, that was anything but pleasant. But the entire hotel is pretty swanky - nice cocktail hour in the lobby bar..very relaxing and good feng shui, if you're into that. And having a Starbucks in the hotel is more than convenient - it's dangerous! But it proved to be a life-saver after our experience in the hotel restaurant, Sauciety. This is no fault of the hotel, but it could have been the worst dining experience we've ever had. There was a breakfast buffet for $21 (normal price for a hotel restaurant) which supposedly included everything on the buffet table, as well as almost everything on the menu..? The explanation didn't make much sense to us - our waiter was rushed and had a think accent. But he took our orders and never came back to the table again. My fiance wanted to modify his order but never had the chance. So he asked another server to place an order for him (which was never placed) and to have our server come to the table - and he never came. My fiance finally tracked him down and had him come to our table, so we could ask if he was still our waiter and tell him how unhappy we were with the situation. Instead of talking to us, he had the manager come out. But that was the best option, as he handled everything very professionally and apologized to us for the inconvenience. We appreciated it but we'd never, ever dine there again. The other thing to consider with this hotel is that it's not actually in the downtown Boston area - it's near their World Trade Center and Boston Convention & Expo Center. But there's a bus/train station nearby - so you can get virtually anywhere in the city via train, even to the airport. We learned the airport lesson the hard way, as we took a cab to the hotel once we'd landed at Logan, and even though the Westin is about 3 miles from the airport, it cost us $20! We took the bus on the way back -- much more cost effective.", "Date": "April 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201cRoom service!?
