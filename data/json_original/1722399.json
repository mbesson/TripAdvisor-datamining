Let me backtrack, when we landed the customs and immigration process went quick and smooth. The van transfer from the airport to the hotel went fine; we were the first to be dropped off. Upon arrival, we were the only 2 people in line with nobody ahead of us, why 5 employees were standing behind the desk doing absolutely nothing is beyond me. Only when the line started to get long did they move to start helping customers. The couple behind us gave us a warning stating how bad the service is. So after what seemed like 30 minutes we finally got checked in. We didn\u2019t want to wait for a bellboy so we grabbed our own luggage. We were in the adult section room 9366 which overlooked the adult pool. Room was great but had issues with the Jacuzzi and ceiling fan not working and the bed was like sleeping on a cement slab so we asked for a mattress pad which helped a little bit. The fridge wasn\u2019t cold. Room was cleaned everyday but only for a couple days did we get wash cloths. Not sure why at 8:30AM we received a phone call asking if we were going to breakfast so they could get in and clean our room-rude! The ice machine never worked. Almost got stuck in the lobby elevator, it is really slow and of course it never got fixed. Were sucked in by the hotel staff to attend a sales presentation selling an elite club membership, complete waste of time. Would have liked to get a massage but prices were too high. This property is gigantic, way too large for the amount of staff working. It was a pain to have to take a shuttle from the room to the beach every day. Everything is at the \u201cmeeting point\u201d which is about a 10 minute walk, at first it was fine but after a while got old. The beach was great as was the weather. Snorkeled from the shore a couple times but didn\u2019t see a single fish. The spa and gym were great. Food was average once again the service was really slow, if an item was gone the staff wouldn\u2019t replenish the food unless you say something. Really hard to get into any of the specialty restaurants, not sure what the issue was with the Italian buffet every time we tried to get in, it was closed. Drinks were ok but not sure why everything tasted like it had nutra sweet in it, left a weird after taste. Went shopping on 5th Ave just a $7 taxi ride one way. Overall the experience was okay, customer service was terrible at this hotel. Serivce is slow because of not enough staff on duty and the staff that is around are way underpaid. This results in unhappy employees which in turn leaves unhappy customers.

This was our our 5th trip to the Mayan Riviera. Our trip was from Jan 30th to Feb. 6th. We have stayed at 3 other resorts along this strip previously and they were all great (the beach is the best along this strip which makes each resort wonderful. Also you are only 5 to 10 minutes away from Playa del Carmen). This resort was incredible (I believe the Riviera section is a newer part of the resort) and it is a big resort which means lots of walking - but met all the needs for our family (grandsons ages 9 yrs. & 4 yrs.). Our room was very modern and incredible (Jr. Suite) the shower was separated and enclosed in frosted glass, the \"throne\" area was also separate, double sink vanity and a jazuzzi tub. While in the tub, we would open the shutters and the boys could watch tv while in the tub (which is a major plus for them... lol). Anything we were missing with regards to minor things like facecloths or towels, we received within 5 minutes of our call to the front desk. Service was great! There are shuttles from the main lobby to different areas of the resort (kids loved to ride at the back of the cart). Lots of great food and restaurants. We were allowed 3 a la cartes and loved each one of them. We chose the steak and seafood, Asian and Mediterranean. The kids did not have to eat from our menu as each a la carte offered a children's menu that offered them what they would enjoy; ie. hamburger & fries, chicken, etc. One of the buffets was an Italian theme - we ate there a few times and loved it all each time (soups and pastas were incredible). We were located in a building near some pools (nice and quiet in evenings, nights). There was a large pool for swimmers and included a kids pool as well right beside it. It was perfect for our needs and never overcrowded because there were quite a few pool areas on the resort. There was also a buffet beside the pools where we could enjoy our lunch. The beach was about a 10 minute walk (but if you had a room in a different area you would be at the beach). Overall this resort was amazing, lots of things for kids to do (although we mostly enjoyed the beach). We were there with two amazing kids and all had a fabulous vacation together - it was just too darn short!!! We live 1000 miles away from the grandsons so this trip was fabulous for us all!! Contrary to some of the reviews I read before we left, Staff on the front desk and those dealing with the public spoke and understood English quite well - housekeeping staff were not so fluent but we always managed to get what we were asking them for which is all you need. One part that was a little disappointing for us was that there was not any bed art left in our room during the entire stay. Every other resort that we've stayed at in the past, housekeeping staff left one of their creations, made from towels each day (my husband always has fun with them by modifying or adding to it). It's not a big deal but is a nice little extra non-the-less. Thank you Sandos and Staff for a wonderful holiday and Nolitours for a great vacation package!!", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cA lot included, unique beach, kite-boarding spot, Gym/Spa, Jacuzzi tub\u201d", "Author": "tarentity", "ReviewID": "UR123610036", "Content": "Stayed at the Sandos Playacar Rivera from November 21 through November 26, 2011. A breakdown: Airport \u2013 Transfer to/from Hotel \u2013 Taxi Take a closer look, research the transportation portion of your vacation package. It\u2019s usually included \u201cby default\u201d, so if you would decide to take care of your transportation on the ground, you would have to mention that to your travel agent, or exclude that option purposely. Regular local taxi transportation will cost you up to 4 times less than a typical transfer package, that\u2019s dependent on your Spanish language negotiations skills. Another option is to use a local transfer company yourself, there are a few. They are at least twice cheaper. Transfer from Cancun Airport to Sandos Resort (~USD$69), a local Taxi to get back may be (~USD$55). Arrival at the Resort We weren\u2019t greeted with a cool wet cloth, but refreshing drinks were freely available while we were checking in. Some were given a cloth bags with a Sandos logo and some items, we weren\u2019t as well, but we are ok with that. Beach The beach is a big advantage here, it\u2019s about 100 meters to the water, water is clear, allowed area to swim is big enough for good swimmers. Another huge plus is that this resort is the very last on the shore to the South West (or to the right if facing the Sea). If you walk few minutes by the shore, it\u2019s almost wild nature out there, the beach is all yours!, water is gorgeous, about 150 meters from the shore there is an artificial dam made of big concrete bricks protecting the beach, I guess, from waves and storms. You can stand on that dam, it\u2019s very shallow. It\u2019s a beautiful place to snorkel around that dam. I would suggest to swim a little further to the Sea \u2013 may find some amazing clam-shells, some corals, and even a stingray. I found a few big gorgeous clam-shells, but the thing is it\u2019s a live animal inside the shell, it will die without the shell, and it illegal to take it across the board. But, it\u2019s beautiful experience and pictures for your memories. The resort is popular among kite-boarders, if you are - bring your gear, if not, they provide with paid lessons if you\u2019d like. Rooms and buildings We stayed in the building next to the main lobby, 3rd floor, room facing pools and the road. The road is obviously active almost 24 hours, so with the balcony open it\u2019s noisy. We had a bad ammonia-like smell from our A/C, thus tried to sleep with the balcony door open. Would suggest the rooms facing the jungle/garden, quiet and pleasant birds singing. Rooms were ok. That building is newly renovated. Clean. Spacious tub-Jacuzzi in every room in that building. Gym, sauna, steam room \u2013 all included. Used almost every day. You may take bikes for all family to have some driving fun. Spanish language would help a lot, we couldn\u2019t sometimes freely communicate with the staff, or they may have better English. Food/ Buffet / Restaurants Buffets \u2013 were as usual, nothing more. Restaurants \u2013 some are adults only, I would try French, but no kids allowed. Other \u2013 serve as buffet during the day, nothing special either. Mediterranean and Italian are of slightly higher level though. Bars/Drinks The drinks were of regular for average All Inclusive resorts a lot of local brands, and some - of better quality and level. The main lobby bar had the best variety. From low-alcohol drinks, like vermouths, e.g. Martini, Campari, beers to Gin Beefeater, and some good Tequilas. Always sodas and beer in the room fridge. Tours Went to the Coba Ruins and climbed. Beautiful view from the top. To me, Tulum is better, plus you can swim at the beach right below the Mayan ruins! In Coba, the main pyramid is much taller than any in Tulum though. Heard, they are closing Coba to the public. Snorkeled in Grand Cenotes, near Tulum \u2013 very nice experience. Sports Club for kids has a lot to offer \u2013 all free, included. Billiard, video-games, ping-pong, etc. Crowd Demographics Obviously the majority of guests are from the US, and Canada. A lot of people straight from Europe \u2013 Great Britain, France, Poland. I would recommend this resort to anyone.

The next year we stayed in the same tower as per request(the hotel was wonderful to grant our request) at this time the resort was building the Hosiendas. The 3rd visit to Sandos we stayed in the New Hociendas & have a private pool. Unfortuneatley we stayed away from the Playa del Carmen area the year after the big hurricane.

Fantastic Room, Many wonderful new places to eat. Never had a bad meal! The beach has recovered and was perfect! Staff was incredible, many pools & bars.

PLUSES: The grounds are immaculately kept and the amenities are great for young children-- lots of pools with shallow areas. Plenty of room for a toddler to walk around. Great paths for pushing around a stroller. The room we were in was perfect. Large king bed plus large sitting area in which we could put our daughter's travel crib. HUGE bathtub separate from shower was fantastic. Kept very clean. Spa and gym are fantastic. Hotel is in a great location on beach and not too far from Playa del Carmen. 5 minute cab ride or half hour walk (really hot weather for a walk though). Some of the staff were incredibly friendly and wonderful with children. These were the serving staff in the restaurants. NEGATIVES: Service was inconsistent. Met some downright rude staff. Only had turndown service one night out of 8. Food in buffet was quite repetitive. \"Concierge\" staff try to rope you into timeshare presentation as soon as you check in.

The Sandos Riviera is the fairly new added section of the Sandos Beach resort, which is beach front, while the Sandos Riviera is set back and you have to walk about 5 minutes to reach the beach from the Riviera section. However, the Riviera section has very nice junior suites with jacuzzi and room service. The Riviera section also has the swim up bar while the beach front section has a pool that is very loud, with lots of kids and tons of activities. We enjoyed our vacation very much both times while at Sandos. Although, I have to say that the first time around the quality was much better. We assume this is because the Riviera section just opened in 2007 and didn't have many return customers yet. We got very spoiled the first time! The food, the buffet, the room service - it was the best. At our second visit, however, the buffet wasn't that great and had reduced hours, the quality of the room service was reduced, and the champaign wasn't that great anymore. Other than that - it was still all worth the price we had paid. We tend to do much of our own activities with a rental car, so we are not stuck at the resort full time. I recommend anyone staying more than a week to explore outside of the resort, or you will get very tired of the daily circus there. Why I chose Sandos: - The beach is absolutely fabulous! This is because you have no resorts or buildings to the south of this resort, thus, the south beach is yours to explore. Walk along the powdery white sand with the jungle on your right side and the beautiful Caribbean ocean to your left. This is perfect for those who like to get away from the tourist crowds that accumulate at the resort beaches. I loved this part the most and can't wait to be back. - Junior Suite Room - with Jacuzzi! Those rooms are comfortable and roomy! No standard stuff and perfect for staying 2 weeks. The balconies have folding drying lines where you can hang your swimwear and towles to dry. There is a large flatscreen TV with American speaking channels. The bathroom is nice with separate toilet, walk in shower and a good sized 2-people jacuzzi in it. - Room service - used to be top of the line the first time we stayed there. But since last year we noticed a few reductions. They had downgraded the quality of many items, like the champaign was a cheaper type and not as enjoyable. In fact, you can no longer get alcohol delivered to your room past 11:00 pm. The little fridge in your room is always stocked with beer, juice and water though. And it was still great to have a bottle of less tasty champaign delivered to our suite every evening - and it was always ready, on ice, and with two glasses when we got back to our room and dipped in our private jacuzzi - all included in the price. Many other AI resorts will not include this in their service. - Customer Service - generally, customer service is pretty good. The lobby gets busy some times but the waiters and bar tenders are all wonderful and very accommodating. We especially like Rafael - the bar tender at the swim up bar. And the hotel manager was more than helpful last time when we didn't like our first assigned suite, because it was located on the bottom floor on the corner, where everyone was walking by. The hotel manager ended up moving us right where we wanted to be - thank you! - Great location. Sandos is within walking distance to Playa del Carmen, with many fun stores near by. The Playacar area is very nice and safe for walks as it is a gated community. All else is pretty typical for an AI, I suppose. The buffett is fine but it does get old and some foods are simply gross. But hey - there is so much variety that you will never go hungry and you can always find something you like. We actually ate out in town a lot - and of course it made us wonder whether we are better off in a regular beach front hotel, but the convenience and extras you get on the resort just can't be beat with this price. You can take bicycles to town, you can take a hobby and sail the waters for an hour, you get a free dive lesson in the pool, ping pong tables, pool tables, the mini disco, music, performances, and the convenience of sitting down anywhere and ordering something without extra pay. I can read my book in a hammock by the beach and walk 3 steps to grab my own ice cream and drink at the Sandos beach snack bar. It felt decadent and satisfying - just like a vacation should be :) Bottom line - can't beat what you get at this resort for its price!", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Experience\u201d", "Author": "Geno1077", "ReviewID": "UR114403834", "Content": "Overall my wife and I had a great time in Playa del Carmen.

The next day my wife and I had diarrhea and couldn't eat anything for 2 days. We ordered chicken wings, club sandwich and quesadillas. The chicken wings were cold and looked a little undercooked. We ate only one and threw them out. If it wasn't for this our trip would of been perfect. We love the Playa del Carmen area and would go back in a second. We also did a trip to Chichen Itza which was awesome but it took 3.5hours to get there which was rough. We also went to Cozumel for the day and rented a car on the island which was great.

For all of us, it was our first time to Mexico, and none of us really knew what to expect! Yes, checkin was definitely slow. We didn't care too much b/c we were so excited to just finally be there! Now, we were expecting to only have 2 reservations based on our number of nights there, but our check in guy told us we didn't have to make reservations - we could eat at a different night every night if we wanted! We were all excited about that. I don't know if it was this way b/c the resort only seemed maybe half full. Perhaps they enforce the reservations policy during busy times. We all got rooms close to each other in the 8000 section on the ground floor. The rooms were great!! Spacious, each had a balcony. Ours overlooked the pool with the Riviera Buffet restaurant. Which was great, a couple times we just walked over, filled up a plate of food, and walked back to our room. This place was only open for breakfast and lunch though. The A/C in the room worked WONDERFULLY - i was nervous about that, I like sleeping in the cold! I slept great while I was here (beds are definitely on the firm side), which for me was incredible as I am such a delicate sleeper, even at home in my own bed. We were all a little nervous about the water/getting sick. You hear horror stories when you tell people you are traveling to Mexico. They provide bottled water in the rooms in the minibar, and restock every day. We brushed our teeth with the bottled water, but a couple times I forgot and used the tap water. (So did our friends) We were also a little nervous about ice in the drinks, fruits/veggies being washed in water, etc. We were happy to learn that all the ice/water they use for food/drinks has been purified. Not one of the 6 of us got even the slightest form of sickness the whole time! The restaurants: it was a little annoying that no one seemed to know which restaurants would be open on any given night. But no big deal, there are plenty to choose from! Breakfast and lunch are always at the buffets (which we thought was great) and as far as the a la carte restaurants, we ate at the Gaucho Steakhouse, the Asian one, the Brazilian (Fogo) one, the Mediterranean, and the French restaurant. I think we would all agree that the Brazilian was the worst by far (but still not bad!!!) and the French was the best. We were all seriously impressed with the quality of food, the presentation, and the level of service with each place we went. And my husband and I consider ourselves food snobs ;) The service overall was fantastic. We were having problems with our in-room safe. called and someone came right away and fixed it. They called us the next day to see how it was going. Thought that was great. Everyone, even the maids and groundskeepers, greeted us with smiles and \"Hola\"s or \"Buenos dias\". Very gracious! We tipped the maid each day instead of at the end and got rose petals or towel animals, fun things ;) I would recommend tipping for great service, we did and they definitely seem to appreciate it. We had a good time at the resort disco at night, but if you want to get off the resort for some nightlife in the town of Playa del Carmen, we highly recommend Playacrawl. Beach, GORGEOUS, water, turquoise; clear. Absolute paradise. Never had a hard time finding a chair or a little hut for shade! Pools, great. Wish they stayed open a bit longer at night though. We mostly went to the one with the pool bar, which was nice b/c it was pretty quiet. The main pool near the beach seemed the most crowded and also the one that seemed to have the most kids, so we avoided that one (we all left our kids at home, didn't need to listen to other ones screaming ;) One other thing. My hubby and I treated ourselves to an 80 minute couples massage at the spa. Let me just say - the BEST we have ever had. They take the full 80 minutes to massage you - (we have had other places that \"give\" you 20 min to undress/redress out of that 80 min) And the pressure was fantastic. I would do this again in a heartbeat. One of the highlights of the trip!! Really hardly a negative thing I can say about this place.

As for Playa del Carmen, I felt 100% comfortable there and did not have any worries about the safety. Sandos itself is in a secluded area (similar to a private residential community). They have a guard when entering inside the community itself and then Sandos resort has its own guard. ROOMS Sandos Riviera and Sandos Playacar are the same property with all the same amenities. The difference is the rooms near the lobby (away from the beach) are considered Sandos Riviera and the ones near the beach is Sandos Playacar. It is about a 10 minute walk from Sandos Rivera rooms to the beach. According to the check-in guy, he said Rivera rooms are bigger. POSITIVES: Although it is a walk, I prefer these rooms because it is a quieter area of the resort and not near the main pool where all the daily activities occur. They have golf carts that will drive you to and from the other side if you don\u2019t want to take the 10 minute walk. You also have your own pool that is bigger than the main pool with a swim up bar and much quieter. Each room has a balcony and a sofa. The room was quite spacious. The bathroom has a jacuzzi bathtub that is huge, a stand up shower, 2 sinks, and the toilet had its own door so multiple people can be in the bathroom at once. There is a fridge stocked with beer, soda, and water. There are plenty of hangers and shelves and a safe. NEGATIVES: The fridge wasn't very cold. We had ants in the room, but there were oddly only on the table where we had some peppermint candies. We also brought food back to the room from dinner one night and ants got all over it. Other than that, the ants were not roaming around the whole room like others said. Therefore, if you have food in your room as soon as you are done take it out the room! For such a nice resort the showerhead is horrible!! The pressure was super low. Check-in process was very slow, they need to speed it up. FOOD/ALL-INCLUSIVE: There are 4 buffets on the property. Grand Buffet Rivera is on Sandos Rivera which is only open for breakfast and lunch. At night it becomes the Mexican al la carte restaurant. The other 3 are on Sandos Playacar. The Italian buffet is smaller than the main buffet (Festival Grand Buffet) but they have a pasta station. The two actually connect so you can go to both. They also have a Mexican buffet next to the pool for breakfast and lunch. At night this becomes the Mederterianean a la carte. The a la carte restaurants are Mexican, Asian, Brazilian, French, steakhouse, Mediterranean. For every 2 nights you can are allow one reservation for the restaurant of your choosing. POSTIVES: the pasta station at the Italian buffet was pretty good. The Grand Buffet Rivera had a great selection for breakfast including an omelet station, fresh fruit, and freshly squeezed fruit juices. I thought this was the best buffet out of all of them for breakfast only! All the buffets have good salad selections. At the Sandos Rivera pool they have a little snack cart by the swim up pool that serves hot dogs, fries, and hamburgers. The a la carte restaurants are 100% better then the buffet (hint: be nice to you check-in person, they gave us 3 reservations even though we were only allowed 2). We ate at the Medditerrian one which I thought was the best, they had a large selection of seafood and the lemon sorbet was AMAZING \u2026 I even ate my friend\u2019s! The Mexican restaurant was okay, but they put cheese on EVERYTHING. I also heard that the Asian and French restaurants were very good. The drinks were pretty good and they had a large selection. Fabian who works at the bar across from the Festival buffet was really friendly and always made good drinks. NEGATIVES: The worst part of Sandos is the food. Unless you love buffets and like to overeat, then you probably will feel the same. Lunch is mostly salads, hamburgers, fries, pizza, and nachos \u2026 i.e. nasty. Dinner obviously had a better selection but nothing spectacular. If you have allergies like I do, make sure you tell them so they are aware when making your meal. The staff is defiantly not use to people having allergies (this goes for all the restaurants/buffets). It\u2019s horrible that you only get one reservations for every 2 days you stay, Sandos really needs to change this. Most all-inclusive are first come first serve for the restaurants. Like other reviews, the restaurants are never fully packed, I believe they do this for two reasons: 1. They don\u2019t want to spend money feeding people all the expensive food and 2. they want to make the restaurant experience more intimate. Make sure you make your reservations when you check in, we tried changing it later and everything was completely packed. Although each restaurants has paper plates/cups and plastic utensils, they really need to add to-go containers to take food with you. Room service is HORRIBLE. They really need to revamp the menu. My chicken wings were cold, there was only cheese in the chicken quesadillas. We were always hungry after 11pm, but the late night menu is the worst \u2026 they only have 5 items and everything is cold and has cheese. Therefore, due to my allergies I couldn\u2019t eat anything. They put this sugar water mix in all the drinks which makes them have an after taste, personally I wasn\u2019t found of it so I stuck to mojitos and margaritas on the rocks. ACTIVITIES: There were lots of activities on the resort, all which are by the main pool. They had games, performers such as a rock night, nothing spectacular, but nice to have. I didn\u2019t go with kids on the trip but there seem to be a lot of activities for them. They have a game room which had a lot of stuff. They also have photographers on site who take pictures throughout the resort with different animals (parrot, iguana) and characters. You can also ask them to take pictures of you wherever you want with no obligations to buy. My friends and I decided to take pictures on the beach. Jesus was our photographer, he\u2019s great at his job. Extremely friendly and loves what he does. He didn\u2019t rush us and posed us how he thought best. He took about 150 photos of us and they came out great, we ended up buying a package which was pretty pricey but we couldn\u2019t resist. The spa/gym on site is really nice. They have a spin class and yoga class as well the gym with equipment. There is also a jacuzzi and pool which is great. It has nice chairs with jets and the water is warm! Great secret to the resort. They also have bikes you can rent to go to town and a small bike tour which was nice. NEGATIVE: The disco on site was really small and pretty bad. It smelled like mold in there. The first night the bathroom flooded and there was water coming everywhere. The next day the smell of mold was so bad and intense, I could not breathe! Sandos needs to just pull out the rugs and put tiles on the floor. It makes no sense to have one. AREA/SHOPPING: 5th avenue is the main street in Playa del Carmen where all the stores for shopping are. The further you go down 5th ave (past 14th st) the more expensive it gets. The owners are extremely annoying trying to get you to go into their shop to buy stuff. They always say, \u2018grand opening\u2019 and be prepared to haggle. If you don\u2019t, you will get ripped off. Buy everything at Playa Mart, they have good prices and everything is marked so you won't be ripped off. You can\u2019t haggle here, but no need to, the prices are right. The store is huge, right across from the water. We wet not once but twice to La Fragata (on 26 st btw. 1st and 5th avenue) for fish tacos. They owners are super friendly, they even gave me some of their homemade salsa to take home). The ceviche was really good too. Nightlife: The street where Coco Bongos is on has a whole bunch of bars and at the very end where the beach is there are two clubs: Blue Parrot and Coco Maya. They are both right on the beach so the dance floor is in the sand. They have good music and the d\u00e9cor is really nice. Blue Parrot also has a fire show nightly. A lot of the bars have open bar specials and some are even free (yes FREE). Coco bongos is a rip off $65 for open bar) we didn\u2019t even bother going. Overall I was quite impressed with Playa del Carmen, everyone was so friendly and polite.

I am not sure how is rating works, but I was staying at 4 stars resort, but with a 3 star restaurants When you finally get in to a La Carte restaurant , half of the tables empty Is that a joke? booked with whom ... empty tables???? Resort just does not want to many people to eat with at a table with a clean tablecloth . Resort wants everyone wait in line for a food at buffet ......First night I woke up with am ants in my bed..... When I checked in and bell boy and me came to my room I saw many crumbs around my bed and on my comforter , I asked him what is this , he just pushed crumbs under my bed with his foot without saying anything. Next morning my bed , floors were covered with ants/ I took photos/. At 7 am I called front desk clerk Oscar who helped me to check in and expressed my problem. He said there is no rooms available I have to wait until after 3 pm. I said but ants are going to eat me alive and will get into my bags???? He replied he will send a bell man to pick up my bags and keep it at the bell boy stand on the front of the resort where I was dropped by a shuttle . I said but I just arrived last night and just woke up and did not go thru my stuff yet, to get ready for a day. He said bell man is on his way to pick up your luggage . I said I am in my PJ and not ready to leave my room. I ask him to speck to a supervisor and call me back. he did not call me back. So I called again and asked him what happened he said we do not have any rooms available. I said but it should not take almost 12 hours in a resort with 300+ room to have one room available sooner . I asked to speak with a supervisor , but Oscar said supervisor will say the same thing. I asked to speak to a Resort manager, he said he does not come in until 9 am. I asked Oscar to pass my message to a Resort manager . 10 AM and still no one called me. I called oscar and asked to what happened he replied resort manager is not in . I asked Oscar to speak to his supervisor ......I mentioned to oscar I took photos of ants on my bed and all over in my room and balcony.... I even found a spot where they were coming from to eat those crumbs were on my bed when I checked in. Oscar said I will send a maid. I said I clean all those crumbs with a tissues and flushed in a toilet, so ants will have no source of the food . I insist of being moved to another room ASAP with my bags, so I could enjoy my first day at the beach with my things , not just hiding somewhere for the day . I mentioned to oscar I paid much higher rate for the room because of 1 person and I want to be able to have a room for my first day, not just have my bags at the front of the hotel...... With in 1 hour I was moved to another room and it was an upgrade which I did not ask. Just want a clean room without crumbs and no ants. Next day I saw much bigger ants on the balcony and some by the windows . I called front desk and asked them to spray just my balcony, not the room. Of course I asked if it it possible to set the time for the guys to come in and spray the balcony. They said yes. It is the same problem , ants found me!!! LOL Resort has large wholes on the bottom of a patio frames, where screws should be , no screws , just big wholes ... at least should off been patched in. I pointed to a bell man who moved me from my first room. He said he will related to someone. I assume it is in every room..... Waiting fir my room to be sprayed at such time... 1 hour later no one......... I wrote a note \" please do not spray in my room, just a balcony\" and inserted on my way out of my room in key slot. When I came back to my room I smelled very strong chemicals even outside of my room... bad news, was sprayed in my room... so strong.... Ocean breeze .... no..., very strong chemicals ... I starts sneezing, I have a very sensitive nose..... / Use Terminix for many years, as San Diego area has a big ants problem, they spray regularly outside/. Open windows, doors, air conditioning does not work when windows are open....... Terrible hot night .... hot room all night ..... I realize resort put bed padding with a plastic/ kids pee proof material/ . I removed it after sweating my back even with a very air conditioned room.... Horrible! Window coverings so short and not connected to the wall ..... 6 am... bright sun shining outside .. so as my room.... No window covering or with it.. almost the same..... Best day rep called me first morning and was trying to get me to come down to see them to sign travel voucher for shuttle to airport/ then they will try to sell you all tours, still do not understand their system, they should know our info, but they insist of you coming down to do their sales pitch/ . She said they work with Bookit and asked how is everything. I said terrible, I slept with ants , room was dirty , she said call front desk, I said I did , she said I need to come down to sign , I said not today, I have to clean room to stay and it is my main concern, I want to relax and not stressed out. She said buy. They is how they really care if you are ok? Why Best day ask that question and saying they work with Bookit??????? Just want to share one of my worst travel experiences ...... Checking in in a dirty room . Sleeping with an ants . Spending first day asking to change a room , to be without ants 7 days of bad food with a dirty tablecloth / only 1 dinner buffet Italian had a clean table cloth , which was open to all of us just 2 nights.... 10 minutes walk to the beach on a heat with a bag..... ok, unexpected hike few times a day on a heat/ I love swimming so normally 3 times a day, no pools fro me/ Resort lets you borrow a bike, but bikes are so old , being repainted sooooooo many times and do not work properly, do not dream about about hand brakes or ringing bell...

I encountered no monkeys Bugging or saw any. Two little creatures crossed our path and were small and harmless. 2. The food is nowhere near bland, and if you like salty/peppery food like my husband, salt it! Don't say it's bad. Very big selection at all breakfast lunch and dinner. Try all the cheeses, they are wonderful. There's an inlet station, tip: you don't need to add to your omlet just what she has there in her section, bring anything to her from the buffet (shrooms,tomatoes,bacon ect. ) and it will be gladly added. Same goes for the pasta station at two of the buffets in the front section of the resort. Pasta section for lunch and dinner gives you 3 diff choices of pasta, pesto-garlic butter-and/or spaguetti sauce plus all the toppings. Tip: after you get your pasta. Go to the grill station which there's 3 sections of, seafood-beef-ham/pork, and top your pasta! Delicious! Don't likeone buffet? Walk on over to the next, we hit 2 diffbuffets for all meals for bigger variety. 3. Adults pool with blue buffet right next to it is a plus! Not too big or crowded. Opens at 11, not for breakfast. Drinks were mostly not pleasant at the bar next to the adults pool mainly because the choices in brands of alcohol. Select loungue bar at meeting point was the best. Bar at reception/checkin is a bit slow. If the machines are out of ice, go to any bar and ask them for some, as per management. Report it to front desk and they will take care of refilling it. Beach waitress service for drinks takes about 10-15 min. 4. Pay the select club price, it's worth it if you want to use the computer as it has built in camera with skype, great for checking in on family/kids back home. Premium drinks a plus. Free Internet, ect. 5. They have the friendliest staff, everyone says hi ma'am as they walk you by no matter who it is, always ask and talk to staff if u have a problem or something is not to your liking and they will immediately accomodate you. Everyone wears hairnets, maids, bartenders, restaurants staff including hostess, towel service, everyone except front desk check in personell. 6. For the love of god don't complain about the walk. There is a pathway with a white line you are supposed to follow, map looks confusing but everything is so simple once you get there. Follow the white line to the metting point palapa that's where the line stops. You don't need a printed map!!! There are signs plus everything is on your left or right once you walk past meeting point. It takes no more than 5-7 minutes. The white line actually ends on the parking lot right before the meeting point, you are supposed to stay to your right down the steps. People that complain about almost getting ran over is because thy go to the left which is a STREET. So don't walk down the STREET use the right hand side steps!!!!!! Easy and obvious. Air is different in the humid/hot weathered places so don't complain about the humidity, u picked Mexico. I live in Florida so I'm used to it but no the rooms don't smell I stayed in the 8300 section. People are juatnot used to the different type of air. Cons: this will happen in almost every resort you go to. The lady that comes up to you while you are in line to check in that tells you to see her so that she can give you important informTion about your stay is a vacation club salesperson (timeshare) although she blatently told me to my face she wasn't. The person that gives you a drink at checkin, the bellboys, they are nice and not associated with them. Be kind to them they are greAt. Don't believe her welcome breakfast it's a ploy to a metting. If u go with best day travel, they will give you an appt card to see them for your return ticket to the airport, don't go. They will try to sell you excursions, unless u need info on that. They have a desk at the meeting point palapa you can go up to them and get you return transfer there anytime like I did. When they asked me why I didn't go to my 'appt' I said I wanted to relax!

It was our first time staying in Playa del Carmen after a previous stay at an all-inclusive in Cancun. We much preferred Playa del Carmen because of the easy accessibility of numerous nice restaurants, bars, shopping, etc. in the downtown area...much less touristy then Cancun. At Sandos, it was not as though you ever need to leave the hotel, however. We stayed in the Riviera section and our experience was pretty consistent with those of other reviewers. You gain a nicer, quieter room with Jacuzzi and bathroom with separate toilet and shower areas for the cost of a few more dollars and a 10 minute walk to the beach/main pool. The compartmentalized bathroom and pull out sofa bed was worth it for our family of four sharing a room. We did miss the convenience of being able to run back quickly to the room from the beach or pool but would probably choose the same location again. All of the restaurants were open during our stay and we had no difficulty obtaining reservations. The food was always extremely well presented and the staff always seemed to put in extra effort to please the guests. If you are used to fine dining in major cities, you may be disappointed. For us the combination of the buffets and a la carte options proved more than adequate and the kids were always able to find something to eat. Not obvious from other reviews we had read, the same basic children's menu was always available at each of the a la carte restaurants we went to, you just have to ask for it as it is not offered. Actvities staff at the resort were significantly better than what we have experienced at other places. There are a wide variety of activities scheduled (often multiple activities every hour) and the staff do a great job engaging both adults and kids in the various activities through their energy and enthusiasm. Water polo was a particular hit with our family. Our kids (ages 11 and 15) also loved the freedom of strolling from the pool over to the terriffic teen lounge area on their own to play pool, ping pong, air hockey, and PS3. The pool and beach areas were well set up with easily accessible bar, resaurants, and snack bar. The main pool got very crowded however and, while all the lounge chairs are adjacent to a palapa, finding a free chair after 8am was challenging. Nonetheless, it always seemed to work out. Service around the pool and the beach seemed to focus primarily on keeping things neat and tidy (which they do very well) and much less on taking drink orders...we were approached maybe once or twice a day in total. Adding more chairs and palapas would be great except I don't thing they have the room for it. Staff in general were extremely helpful in every way possible and again went out of their way to make our visit pleasant. We did experience a bit of a hard sell to meet to discuss the Select Club/ Royal Club. After an assertive no to both our initial greeter and his boss we never were pressured again. In addition to our visit to downtown Playa del Carmen, either a 20 minute or so walk or a 5 min / $5 cab, we used the on-site travel group at the hotel to book a combination ticket to Tulum/Xel-Ha. While it was a bit more expensive then if we had purchased on-line, we wanted to coordinate the off-site visit with our restaurant reservations and the nightly entertainment options. The Tulum/Xel-Ha tour was good although, as others have commented, a half-day at Xel-Ha really is not enough. We felt rushed to see and do the park and did not even try to sign up for the extra cost dolphin, manatee, sea-trek, etc. options. This would have left little time to do anything else. We were not overwhelmed by the quantity of the fish but searching was part of the fun and we did see a stingray on the inland side of the floating bridge. Tulum (and it's fascinating history) are well worth experiencing though and we would recommend booking a separate half-day option for Tulum. Overall, we has a wonderful stay. Staff across the board were amazing and are clearly trying to put forward the best product possible. We would definitely recommend and would certainly stay here again.", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cSANDOS saved our vacation!!!

I call it as I see it. After having our flight cancelled twice, we decided to fly to a different place, meaning a different resort. So we hauled our behinds (trying to stay within the speed limit) to Fort Lauderdale and booked a flight to somewhere. ANYWHERE! We had a great time at SANDOS in the summer so we did not give it a second thought. Sandos in Playcar was it. We booked a flight at the ticket counter, (great price $39 each way from SPIRIT) and called SANDOS from the gate. We spoke to Brenda who advised of a special rate on a Jr. Suite (coincidentally the same room type we stayed with our 3 kids in the summer) at 40% off. We confirmed this was not a gimmick but indeed a special for all websites we looked at while waiting for our flight said the same thing. We arrived at SANDOS and upgraded to SELECT (premium liquor, private beach area, internet at private lounges, spa access) and the rest was history. David at the front desk was great, the beach staff was awsome always catering to our needs, the restaurants decadent and the room (isabel) was Immaculate!!!! Rodrigo from the select club remembered me from the summer, so did Rafael at the pool. No need to ask for drinks. They knew what we wanted, how we wanted it, and when. Massage at the beach...Lidia saw both of us and hugs EVERYWHERE!!!!! We explained our ordeal and how we ended up at SANDOS again and she did her magic. All tensions and pressures were magically removed. We visited the spa for the first time and may I say, next time we go (as in this summer once again) we shall remain there for most of the trip. Fantastic GYM, whirpool, steam room, pressure pool, and facilites all around. The spa truly rejuvinates all of you and getting the select includes this. Otherwise, its a $10 upcharge. Room service was fantastic! Best shrimp cocktail and ceviche you will ever have. Ask for as much as you wish. The will provide you with plenty. Restaurants all around were excellent. The Gaucho (steakhouse) was our favorite. Service was a bit slow but very pleasant none the less. I'm a believer in the product, the service, the genuine caring attitude (everyone is smiling) and the attention to detail.

Have that a few times a day back and forth to get to the buffet and restaurants, beach, theatre etc and it is a HASSLE. I understand some people enjoy the long walks or just love lying by the pool all day but we are beach people and the beach was simply too far. We requested to be moved the second day, they barely made it happen the third day to a much smaller room but that was ok. How much time you spend on a room anyway? The grounds are beautiful, beach is nice but waves were rough, could not swim. As pretty much everywhere you had to get to the beach or pools early in the morning to reserve chairs with shade, otherwise you get left baking in the sun all day. Some people would rudely occupy both pools and beach chairs all day and take up unecessary space. Food was good, not great, sorry, and we're not picky eaters at all.

We were there the last week of Feb into the first week in March and it was basically all families there and maybe some older couples. This was good for our family which included our 6 year old daughter. It's not a romantic couples sort of place. We staying in the Riviera Section and we found the rooms lovely. The highlight is the jacuzzi tub that easily fits 2 people with room to spare. Flat screen TV was nice. Beds are rock hard but this seems par for the course for Cancun. If you find soft beds anywhere please let me know. We found the rooms very quiet and soundproof which I am very particular on. The pools in this section were quiet and we never had a problem finding chairs. I thought these rooms were much nicer then the other sections. Food at the buffets was great. Breakfast had omelette and pancake stations, beautiful fruit salads, cheeses and pasteries. Dinner buffets had variety and were just as good as the sit down restaurants. There were many places to eat so I never felt crowded. There was a buffet at our pool in the 8000 section so food and drinks were never more than a few steps away. They made delicious mojitos - we never had bad drinks here. We also ordered room service just about every day and it was always 20min or less. I ate vegetarian while I was there and had no issues. My daughter always found things she liked as well. I thought the service was good. Maybe not as personal as other resorts, but it was a busier time of year. In my section they brought around \"surprise\" room service - around 5 or 6 it was maybe a cheese plate or chocolate strawberries or wine and fruit to the room. One day they forgot to make up our room and when I called they sent someone right over and offered an apology letter and a bottle of tequila upon our return. All the staff were friendly and work very hard. I never had an issue getting a van to take us around the resort. It's not that bad a walk though. The beaches were beautiful - not a rock in sight. Didn't have an issue getting a chair - maybe a chair with an umbrella, but there were always chairs. Unfortunately it seems from these reviews that this hotel has spring breakers so I would avoid those times.

We have stayed at other all inclusives and this is just as good as 5* ones we have come across. The choice of food is great and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Its a good location with a short cab ride into playa del carmen. However, we were unfortunate enough to go during 'spring break' - I had heard of this but did not for one moment think it would affect my holiday quite so much. I have never come across so many loud rude people as the American teenagers and their parents who were celebrating spring break. Myself and my husband are in our late 30's and like to enjoy ourselves and have a drink, however, most evenings we were unable to stay at the main sports bar as the screeching and screaming from the Americans was so loud we could not hear the live music and also could not get anywhere near the bar to get served. The American teenagers just pushed people out of the way spilling drinks and falling about. Their parents just stood watching them 'enjoy' themselves. In addition to this the language and comments made by these teenagers were terrible, and this went on during the day in front of families with young children and throughout the night as the parties appeared to carry on in their rooms once the bars closed. Again as the parent of a teenager myself I was amazed that the parents accompanied their teenagers on such a holiday but did not feel the need to try to limit the amount of alcohol they consumed or encourage them to behave properly. Although, it was apparent that their behaviour may not have been considered bad judging by the way the adults spoke to members of the Sandos staff on many occasions. It is such a shame that British Teenagers get such bad publicity when I have never experienced such rudeness or arrogance from them on any holiday, let alone the fact that the American Parents are in attendance and find their children's behaviour acceptable and funny. Myself and my husband ended up planning our holiday around the habits of the 'spring breakers' finding after the first few days that the pool bar should be avoided in the afternoon and that the lobby bar in the Riviera part of the resort was a nice way to start and end the evening away from the completely overbearing inconsiderate Spring breakers. I would not normally write a review but this was a very special and long awaited trip for myself and my husband and I feel strongly that I would not want other people to make the same mistake not realising the effect that spring break has on such a lovely resort. Fortunately we did still have a lovely time and would most certainly return to this resort and highly recommend it to couples, groups of people and families - just not during spring break.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, Canada", "Title": "\u201cReasonable for the price\u201d", "Author": "Wavi62", "ReviewID": "UR99172890", "Content": "Good clean room with coffee pot, Food was OK.

Eveynight there was something different music wise going on in the square which seemed to be the congrating point. The bigger pool is on the playacar side which does get very busy throughout the day.

It was a beautiful resort, I would recommend it to a friend, and I would return again. I traveled with my husband and 18-month-old daughter. ROOM: We stayed in a Riviera Junior Suite. Built in 2008, the room was large and beautiful. 18\" floor tiles, Plasma TV, a large jacuzzi bath and separate shower room, double sinks, a pull-out sofa bed and comfortable chairs, and a great glassed-in balcony. (We loved that the balcony had glass railings so our young child could walk out on the balcony and see the view without falling). They gave us a pack-and-play for my daughter, which she did fine in. We blocked it from us using the sofa. The bed WAS hard but surprisingly comfortable, and I slept well. The housekeeping was great (we left a $2-$5 tip every day and were treated with towel animals my daughter loved). The free room service was wonderful when needed. I couldn't have really asked for more. One tip is to put out your \"clean my room\" sign when you leave for the day. I think they're more likely to clean it earlier in their shift that way. FOOD: We thought the main buffet was one of the better ones, and enjoyed eating there. We also tried the Italian buffet and liked it, although there was less selection. We liked that there was a breakfast buffet in the Riviera section, but would have liked if there was a dinner buffet there as well (at night, the location of the breakfast buffet turned into one of the \u00e0 la carte restaurants). We weren't as impressed with the \u00e0 la cartes we tried: the Asian and the Mexican. Well, I liked the Asian, but it's true that it wasn't that authentic. The Mexican could have been a lot better, it being in Mexico and all. But the atmosphere was nice at both places; we just preferred the buffets for the food, and also for the flexibility with a young child. It is great that there are 6 \u00e0 la carte restaurants and 2 dinner buffets as well as a snack bar open in the afternoon. All the restaurants had high chairs available and the service was good. BARS: We don't drink alcohol, so my only experience here was with virgin pi\u00f1a coladas. I do agree with another reviewer that the drinks were inconsistent. There was too much grenadine in the one made at the Riviera pool, but the one by the main pool made one of the best I'd ever had, complete with coconut milk! Yum! There was everything in between the two experiences. CHILDREN: Our child was too young for the kid's club, but we did stop by to see it in case we ever return. There were no toys, and it looked pretty boring, although maybe the resort staff do a lot of activities with them. We did stop by the teen centre or games room and it was awesome. We had half a thought of returning ourselves some evening, and would have without our toddler. It had air hockey tables, billiards/pool tables, floor chess, video game consoles, foosball, and more. ACCESSIBILITY: There were ramps all over the place wherever there were stairs, and we had no problem with the stroller, and neither would a person in a wheelchair. There were elevators to our third-floor room. The only area where there wasn't a ramp was down to the beach, and I mean, let's face it, strollers do not roll in the sand. SPA: I used the hydrotherapy pools at the spa (which I was delighted to find was included) and liked my experience. I also had a manicure and pedicure done and was impressed. I had the chocolate wrap mani/pedi, and it was great. My aesthetician mostly just spoke Spanish, but we managed to communicate all right. I actually enjoyed digging out my Spanish class from five years ago, and she was super patient with me. ACTIVITIES: My husband played beach volleyball, available every day at 4:00 PM. I went to yoga at the spa one Friday morning (available Fridays and Mondays... they don't advertise it except at the spa, so I was happy to find that out). There were lots of other activities we didn't participate in, like aqua gym, Spanish classes, sand castles and face painting for kids... there's a big activity board by the main pool that lists when everything takes place for the day. It's a large resort with lots to do. POOLS: There were plenty of them, and they were all clean and beautiful. There were bars by every pool and always many chairs available, except maybe at the main pool by the beach were there was a shortage, but that's because it was the busiest of them all. The pools in the Riviera section were always slow when we were there and were large and beautiful. There were shallow areas for toddlers at every pool we went to. Oh, and heads up: the Jacuzzi pool in the Riviera section is COLD. Our balcony overlooked it, so we heard a lot of surprised remarks. I don't know why it is, but if you want a hot tub, there's one in the spa's hydrotherapy section (adults only). BEACH: It was clean and beautiful white sand. There were plenty of chairs and activities. The water was clean and warm. CLEANLINESS/AESTHETICS/FRIENDLINESS: Great. The resort is beautiful and clean all over. All the staff was so friendly and everyone would say \"Hola!\" as they passed. Everyone would do what they could to meet any requests, and we had some with a baby. RECEPTION: Besides being a beautiful area, the service here was our only negative experience. We arrived at noon and were told our room wouldn't be ready for another three hours as check-in was at 3:00 PM. We had expected this so we asked for some towels and headed to the pool and buffet. When my husband returned at 2:00 PM, he was told that there were no more of the Riviera Junior Suites (with one king) available for that night, but some would be available the next day. That night, we would stay in one of the Haciendas (with two doubles) and be moved the next day. When he came back to see me at the pool with our young 18-month-old daughter, I said no way, I did not want to move with a baby the next day. We went back and saw a different receptionist who said his manager would be back at 3:00 PM. We returned at 3:00 PM, the manager asked if we had paid for the Junior Suite, to which we responded yes, and she handed us the room keys for one of the Junior Suites. I don't know what that was all about or how a room suddenly became available, but the ordeal caused us a bunch of stress, which was unnecessary. WI-FI: It was available in our room with a good signal and in the lobby and Meeting Point, but there was a cost: $5/hour.

We booked private taxi via Cancun Shuttle and paid $60 \u2013 driver was very courteous and spoke great English to explain to us about the area, culture, sports and even politics. There was slight traffic when we passed by Playa Del Carmen so it took us about 55 minutes from airport to the hotel. Room: Our room in building 9 all the way in the corner was well appointed, there was slight cigarette smell from the central A/C but it was ok as we didn\u2019t need to have A/C on through our stay. The bed was not as hard as some reviewers complained, it wasn't as good as my tempurpedic but was ok. Cushions on the couch and telephone had dirty wet smell though. Be sure to leave tip for the beverage guy on the fridge, we didn\u2019t get our fridge restocked on the second day when I forgot to leave 10 pesos. It was about a 10 minute walk to the beach and 7-8 minute walk to the gym, meeting point and buffet area. Food: It was the best part of this resort. Even the buffet had very tasty food, even better than plus $500/night all-inclusive places we stayed. The only problem was that they have booked too many guests and there were long lines to get into the buffet and inside the buffet every dinner. Then they would be late replacing empty platters on the buffet. IT was so annoying to wait 5 minutes on line just to get dressing for may salad every time!!! But lunch buffets were less crowded as they had 3 locations and the breakfast was the only civilized one with outstanding selections. We had breakfast at the Riviera side where they have Brazilian restaurant for dinner. The only ala carte that we could book was Le Gourmet which was ok. Food had nice presentation but the taste was average and the service was horrible. They were so understaffed and there was no ambiance as there were too many drunk and loud people in the restaurant. We wanted to book other restaurants that looked quieter and nicer but they kept telling us they are completely booked and there is nothing that the management can do when all the ala carte restaurants on Riviera side 1/3 full, my 6 months pregnant wife got really disturbed with this indifferent attitude from the management. MY SUGGESTION \u2013 transform one of the underutilized ala carte restaurants into a buffet for dinner! Bar \u2013 Bartenders were all as fast as speedy Gonzales but they were still understaffed some time. I mainly drank cerveza or mojitos (delicious) and had fruit smoothies at the beach. I enjoyed drinking espresso or caffe mocha in between meals. Entertainment \u2013 We only watched Michael Jackson show which was pretty good \u2013 the dancing amigo is no Jacko but he tried. Gym was well equipped, the machines were not new but had pretty much everything you need. Playa Del Carmen \u2013 You could walk there (about 30 minutes) or take a cab from the front for $5 or 50 pesos. Sometimes they try to charge your $7 so tell the driver your price when you get on. Many massage parlors offering 1-hr couples massage, be sure to bargain and don\u2019t pay over $50 - $60 for two. There is no public restroom unless you go into restaurants, so get ready. Beach \u2013 It was a joke. We would go there before 8:30 AM and barely found any empty chairs, it seemed everyone leave the towels on them then go hang out at the pools or eat. I know the place is cheap but please bring out few more chairs, the beach is very wide and lots of empty land available. There were many Russian family and they would get so drunk and loud. We saw the same people at the Michael Jackson show, they would just bring the chair and sit at your table without even asking and block your view!!! Beach itself was decent, but it felt like being at Jones beach or Jersey shore because of the crowds. I preferred the beach at Negril, Jamaica or Punta Cana over this one. Departure - Sandos doorman got us a taxi. Doorman initially said it was USD $50 or 550 Pesos. I told them it\u2019s $45 or 500 pesos then he agreed \u2013 it seemed that they had commission arranged amongst doormen and drivers. Oh be sure to ask for a drink to go at the lobby bar before you leave \u2013 I had a couple of mojitos in the taxi on the way to the airport =) I exchanged the remaining pesos to USD at Santander bank at the airport, be sure to calculate that they are giving you right amount. These banks still give you a much better rates than the counters that has MONEY EXCHANGE signs though. Conclusion \u2013 Unless you have kids (toddler to pre-teens), steer clear of this place unless you like queing in line after line for every dinner, bothered by timeshare sales reps. If you are on a budget, go to Punta Cana instead.

We had booked for our trip and were expecting to stay in the beach resort and like many were confused that in fact this is simply one large resort that has been extended from its original \"beach\" side property inland to what is now the \"Riviera\" properties. We wanted 2 rooms together and so I e/mailed the hotel before we arrived. The customer service was excellent with a speedy reply from Jessica who assured us whe would try to assist. When we arrived we were pleasantly suprised to be offered two interconnecting suites, decorated to the highest standard, overlooking the pool and swim-up bar in the Riviera. The rooms were modern and spacious, with walk in shower, double vanity sinks and a large jacuzzi bath. The hotel was immaculate throughout, the gardens and pathways were well tended. Our room was cleaned daily and yes occasionally not unti late afternoon, but this wasn't a problem. Any small issues were dealt with quicky so when our mini bar was not stocked in one room a quick call to the operator led to a member of staff stocking it within 15 minutes. Food at the hotel is delicious and plentiful. We'd read previous reviews and thought it might be repetitive....I think the writers forgot to mention the choice....yes its the same each time but there's so much to choose from that you never got bored with it.

My husband and I have traveled to the Yucatan at least once per year for more than 10 years and are very familiar with all inclusive resorts. This resort is beautiful and has the potential for excellence, unfortunately, we so no efforts in that direction. If I had to analyze the problem, I would guess that a lack of proper management and training are the major issues. It is a family resort (our preference) but the activities at the primary pool (closest non-member pool to the beach) were directed mostly at children and were more intrusive than entertaining for our group. The ratio of children to adults was probably 3 to 1 and the pool was extremely dirty. In fact it was worse than any public pool I've ever visited. The water was so cloudy you could not see through it and the bottom was covered in sand by mid afternoon each day. We were there for 8 nights and I was at the pool before it officially opened each day. I observed half hearted effors (if that) to clean the pool. One morning a mother and her small children found a live crab in the shallow child's pool. The resort employees did not know what to do so the did nothing. I finally scooped it up with my flip flops and transferred it to a remote spot on the beach. The service at the pool was very poor except when my husband gave the waitress a $20 tip (a $5 tip the previous day returned few results). One day we tried the large pool with the swim up bar at the front of the resort (probably the equivalent of one to two blocks from the ocean). That pool was clean but the service was even worse there and the bartender's were unable to make decent drinks. Other than a small members' pool, they do not have a pool with a view of the ocean. The beds are the worst I've ever paid for. I do like a firm mattres but these were inferior quality and were simply placed on top of a box-like hard surface. (The reason I was at the pool before it opened each day.) I have no complaints about the food. I thought it was pretty good and much like other large all inclusives. Unfortunately, they were lacking in the service department here as well. They operate the restaurants on a strick schedule. One day at the pool an 80+ year old woman who had just arrived to meet her family was in dire need of food. I asked the service team at the buffet near the pool if they would allow her to eat 15 minutes before they officially opened. (I even explained her situation.) The answer was no, she can walk down to the beach and get a hamburger or hot dog. One thing that surprised and disappointed us is the amount of walking. I've been to similar large resorts that have carts running throughout the resort to give guests rides to other areas of the resort. This resort only had one or two carts that ran between the main lobby where you spend no time and the meeting place (center of the resort) but offer nothing for guests to or from other locations. My husband has some difficulties with his back and between the bad beds and all of the walking, he was miserable before our stay ended. I think their nightly entertainment and \"meeting place\" gatherings are more entertaining that most all inclusives. They did score points in that area. I can't recommend the resort based upon our experience but do recognize that it has great potential to be a good resort.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Graz, Austria", "Title": "\u201cgood value for your money\u201d", "Author": "gecco7", "ReviewID": "UR72474417", "Content": "when we arrived, no one was expecting us because they didn\u00b4t have the actual reservation, only the old one (which was changed months before our arrival). that was pretty annoying, as it took ages until we got a room (of lower category than we booked and payed, as they had given our room to someone else). it was a journey to get from this room to the beach. food and service at the restaurants were very good, as well as drinks from the bars (all inclusive).", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sandos Riviera Beach Resort & Spa", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d1722399-Reviews-Sandos_Riviera_Beach_Resort_Spa-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$175 - $409*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Paseo Xaman-Ha Manzana 1, Lote 1</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Fracc.
