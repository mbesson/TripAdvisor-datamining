Nice reception area and staff very helpful. As detailed in other reviews, though, I can concur that the rooms are very small which I surmise is an issue with many hotels in Paris. The decor wasn't inspiring either. The bathroom on the other hand was a reasonable size but stepping in and out of the bath to take a shower was somewhat perilous because the positioning of the sink did not allow the shower screen to open. It wasn't a problem for me - but not recommended if you're slightly infirm. They would have been much better just having a walk-in shower. I can't understand why hotels insist on a bath because no-one I know ever wants to lie in a hotel bath! We didn't sleep particularly well because the room got very hot in the middle of each of our four nights and you had to throw off the bedclothes to cool down.

As it was just for a few hours, I haven't look for tripadvisor's reviews and booked directly from accor hotels website, looking for low rates. What a mistake! This was my 6th trip to Paris and I've tried Paris Perfect's apartment, Ibis Cambronne, Arvor Saint Georges, Grandes Hommes and Hameau du Passy. If you are looking for low rates, I absolutely recommend Ibis or Hameau instead of Mercure Monty.", "Date": "January 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "York, England", "Title": "\u201cCat swinging not advised\u201d", "Author": "Tum22", "ReviewID": "UR29969199", "Content": "Good location near Folies Bergeres but do not confuse with the now defunct Mercure near Grands Boulevards Metro - the signs are still up and illuminated at night - surely Mercure could have taken then down by now.

I was looking forward to staying with this group, but unfortunately something came up. I gave two weeks notice to advise that i would have to cancel our booking, to which i promptly received a reply stating that we would not get a refund and did we wish to go ahead and cancel. The reply was quite rude and seemed indicitave of the service we would have received, had we stayed. I then replied stating that i would like to stay in their hotel hopefully at a later date and i was happy to negotiate that they could keep 50% based on the inconvienance, but hopefully we would book with them in the future. To this day we still have not received a reply ( a week and a half ) which is very disappointing as they were very quick to advise us that they were keeping our money, even though we didnt use any of the service. Basically this is the easiest $1250 AUD they have made, without care or thought of any customer service. Yes rules are rules, however we are meant to be guests, i dont want all the money back but just a portion as they are getting money for nothing, and we may have selected to use their service close in the future. This has just made up our decision that we are not going to ever use their service again, it's just legal theft, and they obviously have no customer service", "Date": "March 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki area", "Title": "\u201cHad a pleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "FamilyFinland", "ReviewID": "UR17274989", "Content": "We stayed at the Monty Opera for one week in June 2008.

Grand Boulevard Metro line just around corner for easy commute to Eiffel Tower etc if legs too tired! Loved Paris however my watch went missing!!!?? Had a bad experience also at the Eiffel Tower, when at cafe on 2nd floor i was handed a plastic cup of scalding hot coffee!!! Needless to say i burned my hand and spilled coffee. Staff response....handed me a cloth to clean it!! When i asked for cold water to pour over burn i was asked if i wished to buy a bottle!! Was utterly disgusted and no offer of help or even a further coffee was given. Found service in most restuarants etc very poor but refused to allow this to spoil my experience.

I had a very terrible experience in the hotel. On Aug06, at around 11:00p.m., when I got back to the hotel room, RM210, I found that my suitcase was moved onto my bed and my personal stuff, i.e, my clothes and skin care products were all over my bed. Then I checked the lock of my suitcase and found that it was broken and my new purchased things, 1 Louis Vuitton wallet and 2 pairs of Chanel earrings which valued 550 Euro, were missing. My companion found her iPod and Ray-Ban sunglasses were missing too. I immediately went to the front desk with my companion and reported the loss. The Night Manager then went to our room with us and checked what happened. He, my companion and, I found the lock of the door had not been broken, but the door, itself could not close automatically. The night manager called the Hotel Manager, Gonin Sylvie and advised us to talk to her the next day. Then my companion and I went to police station to declare loss. In the next morning, we met Sylvie, the hotel manager. We told her what happened once again and asked for compensation. However, she said she could not give us money back at that moment, but photocopied all of the receipts and declaration form from the police and sent all the documents to the insurance company. We suspected that our stuff was stolen by the staff in the hotel as the door of our room was never been broken. Therefore, we asked her if she could investigate and talked to her staff. However, she said her staff had been working in the hotel for many years but similar cases never happened before so she did not think her staff did it. I am very disappointed on how the Hotel Manager handled this case. She never tried to find out the truth, never checked the cameras and the staff, but only sent my documents to the insurance company and fixed the door. That's all!! I really doubt that was the appropriate handling procedure for a stealing case in a well known hotel group. I was very uncomfortable staying in Monty Opera and obviously the tragedy occurred to me was the fault made by the hotel, but still, I had to pay for 225 Euro. Up to this point, I still haven't received any update on this case from the hotel nor even 1 dollar of compensation. Therefore, I urge Accor group can follow the whole case up for me with Mercure Monty Opera.", "Date": "August 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antibes, France", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed the Monty\u201d", "Author": "pjeanne", "ReviewID": "UR7572409", "Content": "Room was very clean, with lots of light and a nice private balcony wih view over the roofs of Paris.

They provide breadfast buffet with good quality. The mini bar is nice too. It is in a very very convinent site. It is near the metro station and there are so many different kind of resterants nearby with acceptable costs of food. The security is good. For my past experience in Europe, I can place my baggage in the store rooms at the day I check out, however, the room are all free to go in and go out. Everybody can goes in and gets your baggage. But in Mecure opera, the store room is locked all the time. Only the staff can have the key to open the knock and only they can go into the room. They will put a name tab at the handrail of your baggage. Then the baggage can only be picked after idenitfying yourself to the staff. Moreover, the staff are really really helpful, though not all of them can speak in English. One little thing to point out, there is a young lady in the staff who is excellent pretty and lovely. Though she cannot speak English, she is willing to help and talk with anyone.
