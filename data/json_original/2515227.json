The hotel staff were lovely and checked us in with great speed. The hotel is small so do not expect large rooms but it is the attention to detail in each of the rooms which I found excellent for example the hairdryer was in a cupboard under the sink and it was a proper hairdryer that you could simply plug into the plug NEXT to the mirror (other hotels take note) so that you could blow-dry your hair without having to use one of those horrid things stuck to the wall that do not generate enough heat to dry your hands let alone your hair. The wardrobe had a full length mirror on the inside of the door - perfect to check your outfit before going out to a day full of meetings with potential clients. The shower had both a large fixed head and a hand held option. There was writing paper in the desk. The coat hangers were proper coat hangers not the sort that you have to unclip which I cannot abide I mean do they really think I am going to steal a coathanger? The rooms are spotless and very comfortable. The hotel's location is very central - a one minute walk to the Madeleine and Fauchon where you can buy the most divine madeleines not to mention a five minute walk to Laduree to buy macaroons! If you have to go further afield the staff can call you a taxi in a matter of minutes and there are no fewer than three metro stations within walking distance. A great place to stay in Paris.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cExcellent service & outstanding design in the heart of Paris...\u201d", "Author": "sanschr", "ReviewID": "UR125398471", "Content": "perfectly located in the middle of Paris, the unique design, the great facilities and the high quality of service will make you trip memorable and want you to come back.

The hotel is very centrally located. We walked ALL OVER the city from the hotel.

The hotel is located in a great neighborhood with great shops, restaurants, etc. There are different subway lines on about every corner which is totally great for people who use subways. Hint - there is a Starbucks around the corner for those of you who NEED a real American coffee! :) Our room - 401 - was decent size - a bit small for the price, but we overlooked that b/c the bed was really comfortable and since we spent most of our time OUT of the hotel room, it was great for just going back to and crashing. The bathroom was brand new and really clean. A tub with a TV too was a real bonus after a long day of walking. There are 2 windows that open up to the road - which if you are a late sleeper - don't even think about having those windows open in the morning as trash pickup is every day and the way the street echos, you can hear women trodding by with high heels on at all hours of the night. Free WIFI works really really fast as I had emails to write and Facebook check ins to post. We had breakfast there one morning - I think b/c we thought it was free - it isn't unless you pay for it in your room rate. It was very expensive and not fresh in the least. You are better off going out and finding a cafe to eat and people watch for a couple hours. The staff - it's not that they weren't nice - they just didn't make the effort that people who work at hotels usually make - i.e. help with baggage, suggestions with food, travel, etc. They also asked us for our room number just about every time we walked in the door which was annoying and still I'm not sure why they were doing this. The lobby was on the dark side - not dirty, just dark in decor. The staff did help us out with umbrellas one day, which we were greatful for, but as I hear, that should be automatic in a hotel. Oh - the conceirge isn't there the whole time - I believe they are there from 10am to 7pm so if you come in later than that you have to ring the doorbell to get it and one of the people who work there have to come and let you in. All in all, I would stay there again, but probably won't as I understand now there are cheaper places with more amenities. Elevator is really, really tiny. You can only fit two people in it - probably one of the cooler things that the hotel had to offer.

The main reason for choosing this boutique hotel was because we were attending a ballet show at the nearby Opera Garnier and did not want to 'fight' for a cab after the show had ended. Plus, arriving in Paris on 30th December from Lisbon, Protugal, we would like to do some last minute shopping before both Printemps and Galeries Lafayette closes for the festive season's. Having experienced Paris well known small rooms during our younger years, I booked the Hotel Athenee's 'Largest bed in our Largest room' ie their Deluxe rooms. Our rooms wasn't ready at noon, so off we start our shopping spree ... After returning at around 2.30-3pm, our room 301 was finally ready. Upon entering the 'Deluxe room' - my heart sank for a moment, 'What have I done, was this their supposed biggest room? The door leading from the bed to the bathroom was not a normal sized door as it cannot be swing open fully. Instead, it was a cute and small double leaf door, so both doors can be swing open - how intelligient! Well, we consoled ourselves as nearby 5 star Hotels are in the range of 500-600 euros a night for the Year End, and this Hotel only charges us 300, with breakfasts and Wifi included, and its only for a night. We unpacked a little but soon discovered that the room wasn't that 'small' after all - especially if we place our two small cabin bags in the huge closet and push the table and two arm chairs (so very comfy chairs!) closer to the King bed. In that way, we actually do have some extra space to move about. Next, since this is a new hotel, the whole room and bathroom was entirely new, and it has a tub with a small TV (but poor reception!), single basin and WC cubicle. Everything worked and even the TV has one BBC channel, nice! Other pluses were - good and powerful hair dryer, good quality toiletries with rare 'hand cream', and most importantly, the most comfy bed of all the 6 hotels in this trip - even better than the 4 stars Hotel Raphael (stayed 2 nights) and 5 stars Hotel de Crillon (stayed 1 night). The road which the Hotel is located on is actually quite a lively road, with restaurants, cafes, a supermarket, a pharmacy, and one or two more Hotels. During the day, traffic was quite busy and napping was a little difficult. However, when night falls, we had a solid 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep ... we even kept referring to the Hotel Athenee's bed while staying at the other two Hotels in Paris. The common areas, though small, are very charming indeed. Cons of staying here are - at 300 euros a night, it was a tad expensive considering the Hotel Le Vignon, also a 4 stars, located on the next street which is charging around 100 euros lesser for their biggest room; the whole room was so so dark that you could not possibly read other than on the bed, a huge chandelier in the centre of the room would have been nice; breakfasts offered was simple and fine but only half a cup of coffee was offered, no fruit juices nor mineral water in sight? Overall, though the Hotel is rated 4 stars, we felt it is more like a solid and good 3 stars. If this was truly 4 stars, then why is the Hotel Raphael also rated a 4 stars (huge common areas, roof top terrace and an in-house Restaurant)? But since the Lady Boss and her staff are all so friendly and helpful, the Hotel Athenee is now brand new and located superbly for the Opera and shopping, we felt we did have a good stay here as well as a very good night's of sleep - these are good enough reasons why we are granting it a 'Very good' rating.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cFriendly staff, but not a great choice.\u201d", "Author": "explorerlala", "ReviewID": "UR121524909", "Content": "If you are traveling for business, they do have wifi, which is helpful.

Perfect for getting to everywhere with great access to the Metro too. Fairly quiet street, with plenty of good cafes, bars and small grocery shops just moments from your door. The staff were very helpful - checked us in and out very quickly - always around to answer questions and went out of their way to sort airport transfers, recommend the best local cafes etc. The downside - We are experienced travellers ...This hotel is fine for a few nights - but no more than that really... I have to say that the 20 or so rooms are small....and I mean SMALL! We had room 502 (top [5th] floor at the front) ...just about the smallest on the hotel plan it turns out...and it was really VERY small indeed. So much so - there is no room for a wardrobe or even drawers for your clothes ...just a tiny cupboard built into the wall..you have to bend down for, about 3 foot high, with a clothes rail in that you can hang shirts from ...but certainly no room fo a dress. Because it was the top floor - the ceiling sloped a lot...and you had to watch for hitting your head all the time (we both did - and we are not tall!). The window looked out onto the road ...but the angle meant you couldnt see anything ...just the buildings opposite. You didnt really have a choice about this ...because the curtains did not really cover the window fully ...which meant the sunlight came in every morning and woke you up whether you wanted a lie-in or not! The bathroom was fine and was 4 star - again very small - but fine ...with a good shower - however - sadly this leaked out onto the bathroom floor every time it was used. All this said - the room was very clean and tidy - housekeeping was good...there was a mini-bar and small safe built into the wall ...and you did feel comfy and cosy ......just a bit too cosy really! Managable for a couple of nights...but too much of a squeeze for longer!", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rancho Santa Fe, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, exceptionally clean.\u201d", "Author": "mjkMD", "ReviewID": "UR115760299", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 8 nights.

The rooms are TINY and the decor is unspeakably awful. This is all topped off by the fact that the hotel manager is utterly incompetent and is THE RUDEST WOMAN IN EXISTENCE!! The prices for what you get are EXTORTIONATE! We paid over \u00a3200 a night for a room that was RIDICULOUSLY SMALL (think Harry Potter's linen closet). There was literally a bed, no storage, no floorspace all surrounded by low hanging beams for you to bump your head on. The room was made to look even smaller by a horrible beige Egyptian theme wallpaper complete with sphnixes, pyramides, sinister owls and camels- so instead of feeling like I was in Paris I felt like I was entombed in ancient Cairo! The cramped hideously decorated room would be forgivable if it wasn't for the fact that the hotel has the RUDEST hotel manager I have ever met in the 38 countries I have visited. Everything you asked of her was met with a rolling of the eyes and cold contempt, she looked as though she really delighted in being rude and made you feel like you should be serving her! When I asked to change the room, I was told that although there was another one available it was going to be an extra \u00a3300 PER NIGHT to change. I explained it was my birthday weekend and asked whether the manager would meet me half way on the price she just snapped at me and said \"It's not my problem its fashion week!\" When I checked out I saw my bill came to around \u00a3800, I was shocked as I remembered paying in advance online. The rude manager said \"no we just take a deposit and charge you at checkout\", so I paid. But then I checked my bank statement and saw that I had paid in advance and she had just CHARGED ME (the best part of 1k) FOR ANOTHER STAY!! I was furious but instead of apologizing she said \"we all make mistakes, for example you didn't even bother to make your bed in the morning!\" I lost my temper and eventually she managed an insincere sorry delivered from behind a pursed contemptious sneer. The only saving grace of this hotel is its location and the lovely tatiana who is a helpful concierge. But this IS NOT A FOUR STAR HOTEL and what you get for the price is laughable. Save yourself a lot of grief and money and stay at another hotel. This place is so dire it makes fawlty towers look like Shangri-La!

The entire experience at this hotel was fantastic. Pre- arrival communication was good. I arrived very early in the morning and was treated by the very lovely Tattiana and the Hotel Manager. A room was made available to me immediately and the room was beautifully styles, clean and very Parisian. Breakfasts served in the Red Bar are fantastic. continental, no buffet here but set you up perfectly for the morning and they are healthy. The Hotel Manager was unobtrusively but omnipresent throughout my 4 day stay. Although I didn't ask his name, he made me feel that I could have asked for the moon at any point during my stay and it would have not been too much trouble, he would have arranged it. The rooms are a good size for Paris but not huge. The styling and boutique service in this hotel is excellent. And unlike many of the much more expensive international chains - there was free wi fi.

We enjoyed our stay very much indeed. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, for example, making dinner reservations and recommending the best local shops. They were cordial at all times and, as such, I was surprised to read the previous review. We stayed in two single rooms which were certainly compact but were absolutely fine for one person with limited luggage. I have stayed in smaller double rooms in other hotels in Paris. The rooms were very stylishly decorated and the beds were extremely comfortable. The bathrooms were also very well kitted out and the shower was powerful. Robes and slippers were provided. The common areas have also been refurbished beautifully in an opulent style. Free wifi was provided. The location was great, we were able to walk to all the major sights. There were a number of good restaurants nearby, along with a number of good shops. We did not take breakfast at the hotel as it seemed a little expensive for what you got. We went to the cafe at the end of the road on two mornings and on the last day we went to Laduree on Rue Royale as a treat. We thought that the rate we paid (having booked directly with the hotel some time in advance) was reasonable in light of the quality of service and the rooms. If I had to make any criticisms, they would be, first, that the air con did not work properly on our first night so both rooms were very hot. This was remedied on the second night. Secondly, toiletries were not automatically replaced by the maid when they ran out which was rather frustrating and a little below par for a 4* establishment. These were however very minor issues in what was a very enjoyable stay in a gem of a hotel in the heart of Paris.
