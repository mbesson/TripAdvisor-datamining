{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Checked out after one night! This review dates back to a stay in 2003 so obviously things change! We stayed here as part of a tour of malaysia and the east coast of Oz. It was horrendous! we arrived late in the evening laden with heavy bags but the porter refused to help us carry anything to our rooms despite there being no lift! Once we arrived in the room it was shabby but just about acceptable, the shared bathrooms, however, were not! Pubic hairs and dodgy bits of tissue all over the floor! What really capped it for us was the couple staying in the room next door. Constant banging and shouting, I was quiet scared at one point, needless to say the next morning we promtly checked out and grabbed a cab to the wonderfull Novotel on darling harbour, which incidentially, serves the best breakfast Ive ever tasted ( I went back for thirds!!!) tha Pallisade is cheap but certainly not cheerfull! Great views in a historic part of the city but consider carefully before booking.", "Date": "Aug 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR350420072", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "karenmat"}, {"Content": "Shabby and not chic We stayed here after leaving booking late and not having too much choice. Firstly the views of the Harbour Bridge are spectacular, you can't see the Opera House but the view of the back of the Bridge is great. Be aware you can't see this from all rooms though.Our room didn't seem to have been decorated or had any new furniture for at least a decade. Things looked very shabby and the bed wasn't that comfortable. The other furniture looked like it had been collected from garage sales. I have no problem with shared bathrooms but these were also in need of refurbishment and weren't cleaned enough to cope with the useage - a definite need for shower sandals / thongs / flip flops!Tha manager's attitude was quite rude and she could do with some basic customer service training although the staff in the bar were really nice.Great location close to The Rocks / Observatory, awesome bridge view but rooms worse than the worst Spanish hostel to quote a friend. Not sure if that's a slur on Spanish hostels but I'd certainly look elsewhere!", "Date": "Mar 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR990500573", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "2manymilos"}, {"Content": "Great price, great location, good room, fun pub!

Bargain find in Sydney I was advised to stay at the Palisade by members of Tripadvisor as I was looking for somewhere with a view of the harbour but didn't want to pay the earth. Boy did we have a view! - our room shared a large verandah on the third floor with two others and you could see the harbour and the bridge in all its glory - but not the Opera House as this is obscured by buildings. The room was nothing to write home about but it was absolutely fine for our purposes, nice and big with a wardrobe, one working bedside lamp and fresh towels and soap each day. The bathrooms are on the landing and have reasonable showers and plenty of hot water. The Rocks, the area around the hotel is Sydney's most historical district and is beautiful, almost like a village within the city. There was a handy late-night grocery store just by the hotel, plus the Lord Nelson hotel is close at hand for beer and sustenance, we didn't try the Palisade restaurant as it was closed one night and it was also quite expensive. The Palisade bar was handy though for a nightcap. We did a very circuitous route to get to the city centre but once we'd discovered the short cut it took us about 10 minutes to get into the heart of everything. Highly recommended for travellers who want a view but don't want to pay big bucks for it. Do ask for the rooms higher up the building otherwise it won't be quite the same...", "Date": "Dec 8, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR585321979", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "joiedevivre19"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d583800-r19080411-Palisade_Hotel-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "583800", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
