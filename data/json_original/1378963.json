We came for the Xmas markets. The Hotel was lovely, clean and comfortable, reception staff speak english and can give you a map of Berlin. The breakfast was continental but they did have some German bits and bobs that you can eat (sausages, Lamb kofta bites?, Egg, Beans) The Underground is very near the hotel ( go out the door, turn left and then turn left again, to the top of the street is the underground) You can use the underground to see all the sights in Berlin, an all day ticket is 6 Euros but you can get on and off the under ground and over ground train, we used this to get back to the airport! so dont use a taxi there more expensive. The maps for the underground are very easy to use and understand. They dont seem to have any English tea anywhere in Berlin apart from McDonalds! so had a few trips to get mums brews from here, they are pretty much everywhere. The Xmas markets were fantastic! they all sell the same things, most of which we didnt want but they still looked fab! (gingerbread hearts, hand carved xmas toys,lampshades, mulled wine etc) The foods stall are excellent, we ate lots of sausages! Bratwursts are lovely! also they have some doghnut balls with iced sugar on them that are just awesome! The markets are very attractive to see and it feels very christmassey when you see them. Eating out can be a tad expensive in restaurants etc. We stuck to the street vendors and Mcdonalds etc. We found a great Itallian place that serves great pasta dishes that are quite cheap. It is situated on the same road as the hotel -Neue Kant Stra\u00dfe about 15 mins walk down the street. We went to all the attractions, the Berlin wall & Brandenburg Gate are a must and Alexanderplatz and Potsdamaplatz both have lots to do. There are some great shopping centres here if you want to shop. All in all we had a Magical time here and we would def go back.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "mumbai", "Title": "\u201cIdeal hotel for Messe Berlin\u201d", "Author": "satana66", "ReviewID": "UR90196024", "Content": "I was there for IFA, the second largest show for consumer electronics, and wanted a hotel close to the Messe Berlin and also reasonably priced.

Theres another Ivbergs from the same group - The Ivbergs Berlin Messe, so be careful while booking. The hotel is just 10 minutes or 2 stps from the Messe.

Although you are a wee bit away from the main sights, public transport is excellent. However, we walked to the Brandenburg Gate, which took about an hour and thereafter into the centre of the city.

Breakfast was for 9 Euros, but I chose instead to go for the yummy bakery goods and coffee at the supermarket across the street. Good wifi connection.
