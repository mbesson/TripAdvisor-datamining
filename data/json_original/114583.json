We chose this hotel because it was close to what we wanted to see (Aquarium, Chinatown, Art Museum). In that regard, it didn't disappoint. 10 minute walk to the Aquarium, 5 minute walk to the subway station, 15 minute walk to the Art Museum. It really is a great location for the lower Michigan Drive attractions. There were 4 of us, 2 adults and 2 kids in a room with 2 double beds. The room was standard, nothing more. The room was clean and the bedding and towels were well laundered and comfortable. Decor, TV, and lighting, were all out dated and in need of functional & decorative upgrades. The beds were not very comfortable and also felt like they needed to be upgraded. The walls and doors are VERY THIN. You can very clearly hear conversations in the hallway, even at normal speaking volume, so that was certainly a problem. In the middle of our first night the electricity in the room went out. When I called the front desk, they were polite and helpful, and I got the sense that they had experienced this frequently from their response. The did, however fix the problem promptly and followed up to make sure, which was appreciated it. Our tub also had a very, very slow drain. To the point that the water was up to my wive's lower calf while taking a shower. When we informed the front desk, they were apologetic and polite, and offered to let us keep our car in their garage a few extra hours so we could explore the city more before leaving town. Overall, the hotel was OK. We had problems to deal with, and the staff was at least helpful in getting them resloved, maybe not over the top helpful, but they did get the job done.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westfield, Illinois, United States", "Title": "\u201cGreat location!\u201d", "Author": "Tiffani C", "ReviewID": "UR125935564", "Content": "My family stayed at this hotel for 3 nights, it was clean and nice.

While in Chicago, we stayed at the Best Western Grant Park Hotel. For the money, it offered us the best location (walking distance from the waterfront, public transit, and several museums). It's a Best Western, not a Fairmont, so don't expect the world but the room was clean, check-in and check-out were without incident, and the location was awesome. If anything, we could only complain about the fact that accessing the Internet from their lobby-based computers was next to useless (slow!!). Some people may be put off by some of the noise from the above-ground rail system but hey...that's Chicago (and thank goodness for the train's close proximity since it took us from/to the airport). Being downtown has its perks. There are also many diners, pharmacies, and supermarkets in the general area. At the Grant Park, you're never far from any of the essential amenities.

Not only did we get a killer deal, we were treated very well. The hotel was 150.00 less than the Hilton per night and only 2 blocks away. It is small and narrowly built hotel so the hallways and elevators were also small and narrow. Not a bad thing but definitely not something I'd want to encounter if the place was packed. The room we had, 725 was basic but nice. Queen bed, TV, 3 lamps table and chair for furniture. No refrigerator or microwave, the latter I would have liked but it was no big deal. The bathroom was small but my tall husband was very happy to have a shower head that was set so high up on the wall and had piping hot water flowing. There were some signs the place has some age, there were repair marks on the shower and curtains although clean were a little dated pattern wise. Again, an observation but far from a complaint. We ate breakfast at the restaurant there twice and had the breakfast sandwiches to go one day as well. The staff in the morning was pleasant and friendly, checking on us often and making sure we didn't have dirty plates hanging out on the table. We really had a great night one Saturday when we wandered in for a couple of drinks. That choice turned out to be our best choice of that day. The manager on Thaddeus was so great! He chatted with us about the city and things to do and even let us try some of the local Goose Island beer on tap because we were curious. The other staff on duty, Zachary as well as another waiter all came over to see how we were and made us feel so darn welcome. We were sitting at the bar about 3 hours talking and enjoying the company of the staff. There's service and then there's entertainment, that night we got both. We were sad to know they weren't going to be en the next evening, our last there. Now location can't be beat for this hotel. A frozen 15 minute walk through Grant Park and we were at the doors of the Shedd Aquarium and the rest of the Museum Campus along with a really nice view of Navy Pier and the skyline. Going the opposite way we visited Millennium Park and the Art Institute of Chicago. We were also about 10 minutes away from the red line entrance. There is a bus stop right outside the main door too.

However, our two rooms were absolutely clean, the front desk service and the maid service were excellent, and the manager, Octavio, went out of his way to fix a problem that we had with Priceline accidentally cancelling our reservation: he even made an even better reservation for us in case Priceline wouldn't honor its arrangement with us. The best thing about the hotel for us is that it was a 15-min. walk to the Art Institute of Chicago, our main reason for going to Chicago for four days, and ten minutes from the Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, and the Planetarium. The hotel is just across the street from a major park along Lake Michigan. And there are plenty of stores and restuarants of many kinds on the nearby major streets--Michigan, Wabash, and State. There also are a number of bus lines and L (Elevated--the subway/elevated train system that goes everywhere in Chicago). We felt very safe and protected in our rooms, too, because of the alertness and number of staff in the hotel at night. Our car also was locked behind behind a chain-link fence that was very secure. The only drawback was the cost of parking: $24 per 24-hr. day. But I checked parking in other hotel ramps, and theirs cost even more. This is the one thing I would check out more thoroughly before staying in that area again--a cheaper but just as secure parking area. There was, in fact, metered parking on the street in places, but that was only good for a few hours at a time. If you're staying for several days and not using your car, it might be possible, after dropping off your luggage, to park at a prearranged, much cheaper, and even more secure lot several miles away, then take the subway/elevated train or the bus back to the hotel. In all, though, we thought we got a great deal. We wanted an inexpensive and comfortable hotel, and we were very happy with the result.

Nice running/walking /biking trail right along the lake and beautiful gardens and fountains there too. saw fireworks one night from our window. Few minutes walk to the Field Museum (natural history), aquarium, and planetarium. About a 20min walk to the Art Institute and Cloud Gate. The hotel itself was fine. It's an older hotel- some might find the bathrooms and elevators small but everything was very clean and the front desk staff were very helpful. Good location and value. Beds a little soft. Internet service was very slow and one day I had a problem connecting. Someone came right away and brought a cable to plug directly into the router in the room so then service was a little faster.Did not visit the pool. Ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant every day. They have a hot and cold buffet and a take out counter as well. Not too many restaurants in the neighborhood as it seems to be in transition with a lot of new high rise condos going up all around. We found a good restaurant on the next street, Eleven City Diner, with good food and cakes to die for! There is also a good brunch place next door, Yolk, but we did not eat there. Big grocery store also on the next street with the weird name of Jewel-Osco where we bought fruit, snacks and sandwiches. We took the El from O'Hare Airport- blue line, then two stops on the red line. Roosevelt station is 5 minutes walk from the hotel and the entire trip costs $2.25 (takes about one hour). We got Chicago Go passes for three days to visit the sights. We went to the natural history museum, planetarium, aquarium, Art institute, Contemporary art museum, and took the Architectural boat tour. All highly recommended esp. boat tour and jellyfish exhibit at the aquarium. Another perk of having the pass was using the Hop on hop off bus tour which took us from location to location which has a stop at the Hilton nearby the Best Western.

Be prepared for this expense, because we paid $44 for parking for a total of 48 hours in that garage. The hotel is clearly geared towards catering to families, and by that I mean there were families and children everywhere, and screaming babies in several of the rooms next to ours.

There are only two very small elevators, meaning that you're usually waiting for an elevator, and once you get on one, you're crammed in there with a several other people.

On our 2nd morning my aunt discovered bites all over her body. As we looked through the bed we found 2 bedbugs between the mattress where my aunt was sleeping. We kept these bugs and pictures/videos that we will place on Youtube and we will be contacting our lawyer. This is disgusting on so many levels. How can they rent a room without conducting a inspection of these bugs???? So we had to check out right away. We didnt even bother going to the desk and complain. Why should we? To get a free night or our room being comp? It's not worth it and this Hotel never will have us, my family or friends as their guest. This experienced will be shared through everyone I know and everyone they know. I also did some research on-line a found similar complaints of this hotel having bed bugs in the past. I wished we did that before planning our family trip. But from this day forward we will. The Internet was a total JOKE.

We tried callinig down to the desk but the phone just kept ringing and ringing. 24 hours guest service as they claim didnt seem that way. Lobby was dirty and dusty. Elevator had a bad odor.

All rooms are of the same size, or very close to it, and they are of modest size, especially by American standards. Ours had a standard (and comfortable) double bed, which left enough space for reasonable comfort, but nothing more. We took a lake-facing room. We paid a substantial premium for this, but the outlook was very nice, indeed. However, we were on the 9th/top floor, and I would think at anything on the 6th or below, the more limited outlook would not justify the cost. Further, these rooms face Michigan Avenue, which is a very busy city street - on the 9th floor, traffic noise was quite intrusive; below that, it would be progressively worse. There is a valet parking service, for which the daily charge is $24 (plus tax). I thought this was quite a hit, but it turned out to be reasonable in comparison with other nearby sites, of which there are many; in fact, I didn't find one cheaper. The parking used is adjacent to the hotel, just metres away, but there is no self-parking and the hotel will not allow you to access your car while it's parked there. If you want to do so, they have to bring the car to the door. The hotel's location, directly opposite Grant Park and about a mile south of downtown, is really good, certainly at this price. The #3 bus runs past the door, and it will take you north to the Magnificent Mile in about 5 minutes. We were very pleased with the location. But we had several irritating problems. When we arrived, the room had no lighting at all except for two low-powered bedside lamps - it soon got too dark! We asked for a floor lamp and that was duly delivered, with the comment that it should have already been there - did no-one notice this? Next, because of the number and location of electrical outlets, we found the microwave would not work unless the fridge was unplugged, and vice versa. We complained about this, and a man duly arrived with sundry electric cables and, eventually, got everything to work. Again, sloppy. Finally, there was the wifi, or lack of it. Wifi is supposed to be available in all rooms, but would not work in our room (although, when I tried my laptop in the lobby, that worked fine). We stayed for 3 days and, still, when we left - no room wifi. Annoyingly, the reception staff always tried to deflect this issue to their service provider (their first proposal was that I, a guest, should contact this provider) without, I believe, making the slightest effort to fix the problem. On checkout, they conceded \"there might be a problem on the 9th floor\", still attributing it to their ISP. I doubt this situation will ever change so, if wifi room connection is important to you, I recommend you test the room offered before committing to it. We enjoyed the location, the room was comfortable, and the rate for this location was not bad.

Now, the Palmer House is a very nice, vintage hotel sitting right on top of the Red Line. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty cool place to drop by if you like art deco motifs and a cool throwback lobby bar. However, I spent my nights at the Best Western Grant Park. Now I know that our friends at the ole' BW don't advertise that their properties will be on par with a Hilton, however they are expected to hold up some modicum of adequacy. This property is anything but... The exterior of the hotel is as tired and careworn as Phyllis Diller after a long night in Vegas. It literally looks like its about to be torn down. Shabby and tattered, it sticks out like a sore thumb amongst the gleaming new high rise condos along the lakeshore. The lobby is small and noisy, but does have two complementary computers for the use of guests. Check in was quick and easy, and then I made my way to the room. My room was a reflection of the exterior, beaten down and threadbare. It was dirty and the furniture was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbeaten up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c literally. It looked like someone had been at it with a ball-peen hammer. The television was so old it required some odd device to enable it to have a remote control and the tuner inside hummed like someone on the Gong Show. I turned it off almost as soon as I turned it on. The bed\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6well, the bed had one of those wonderful scratchy polyester bedspread things that you wonder what would be on it if you blacklighted the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it went in the closet as soon as I walked in. It was as lumpy as cold oatmeal and the sheets stank of bleach. I suppose that I should have been happy they were sanitized. I will say one good thing, the two pillows they supplied were awesome \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the squishy huggable kind. The bathroom was crammed into the corner of the room and was also pretty filthy. I love flipping back the shower curtain to see a very long red hair draped over the tub. Yummy! The toiletries were standard BW wrapped soaps and mystery shampoos. There were no tissues in the dispenser and it was not refilled the three days I was trapped there. I did not venture into the pool, which looked like it belonged in a trailer park, but I did go to their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153workout room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It was wedged into a converted guest room and did have a treadmill, stepper, elliptical and universal machine. There was a TV in there to watch while you sweated away. I went back to the room from the conference at 2:30 one afternoon and my room had still not been serviced (which I can understand as I was not checking out that day.) However, when I did politely ask the maid in Spanish if she could clean my room next she basically rolled her eyes and stormed back to her cart. I made sure to hide my toothbrush before she went to the room to clean it. The strange thing about this hotel for me was that I was the only U.S. citizen staying in it. I heard more languages spoken in those three days than I did when I toured the U.N. building. I know the dollar is weak enough for our European and Pacific Rim friends to stay in better locations. However, I saw more German backpackers and folks toting cameras that I ever have in one, filthy little place. Bottom line, if this hotel is actually still operating when you go to book your trip and has not been condemned, find another place to stay. There is an actual Hostel down the street on Wabash that looked a hell of a lot nicer and is probably cheaper.

Several reviews from this site suggested that the hotel was basic but very clean and that the staff was very friendly. I put my faith in the trip advisor reviewers and they didn't let me down! I was pleased with my selection. This hotel is not as sexy or enticing as some of the trendy boutique hotels, but it is well maintained! If you're looking for luxury- you should bypass this spot. But, if you want a nice and affordable place, this will definitely serve that purpose. The exterior is pretty basic. The room interior was fine- flowered comforters and curtains, beige wallpaper, teal carpet, a picture on the wall...it's fine! The beds were nice and comfy. The wireless access was free (this was greatly appreciated)! I think the beds were doubles instead of queens but we quickly got over this. Also, the room wasn't as large as I thought it would be based on the website pictures- but it was not cramped (3 adults had a little room to move around). My only gripe with the hotel is that our wash cloths were taken but not replaced (hand and bath towels were replaced)- I found that odd and slightly frustrating but easily remedied!

You can hear everything anyone in the hall or next room is saying. The doors to the rooms can only be shut by pulling very hard on them.

We wanted a great location for a little money. I was pleasantly surpised at the BW Grant Park. We too experienced a too-long wait at the front desk, but when it's your turn they do pay attention to you. We dealt with Octavio on a couple occasions and he was very helpful and nice. The hotel is very clean and well maintained. The soaps and shampoos in our room were replaced each morning we were there. We were on the Lake side and I am glad. Great view of the park, the Shedd, the Field and Adler Planetarium, which are easy to walk to. You'll have to take the bus to Science & Industry but it's an express and it gets you the closest. As for anywhere else in the city the Roosevelt station is just a couple blocks away. As another reviewer mentioned there are aggravations. The restaurant was under renovation, so they did offer free continental breakfast of donuts, pastry, bagels, watery OJ and coffee...and good luck finding a place to sit in the small lobby to eat it. We ended up going in shifts to carry enough upstairs to eat in our room; no trays were offered so be careful balancing that donut on top of your coffee cup while you push the elevator button :) Also, when we checked in during the late afternoon on Saturday the hotel's valet lot was full. My husband headed around the corner to the public ramp. It was more expensive. But, they did let us walk up to the car to get the stuff we needed. But, they didn't open until 9am, so it pushed our itinerary back while we waited. We left the car there the whole time and used public transport exclusively; way easier than driving in Chi-town! The location was GREAT and I'd definitely put up with the aggravations again. Next door is a tiny grocery called Clancy's (I think?) and they have the water, snacks, newspapers etc that we all need to get through the day. Also they have the visitor one day transit passes that cost $5 and are good for El and buses...super easy to use and easy to stop in to buy.", "Date": "April 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cRoom for improvement...\u201d", "Author": "FKAPUK", "ReviewID": "UR4735877", "Content": "The hotel is not as bad as reviews had made it out to be. I arrived and was greeted by a friendly woman on the front desk, and all staff were always very helpful and always smiling. The only problem I had with my room was with a light which broke, and the guy at the front desk said he'd have someone fix it. I had been in the room less than 2 minutes when an electrician showed up and fixed the light. That was good service. The hotel is also really well located. It faces Grant Park and Lake Michigan, and its location on S. Michigan Avenue is wonderful - only a 10-minute stroll into the Loop, or, if you're lazy like me, one stop on the El from Roosevelt station, which is just 1 block away from the hotel. The free breakfast was also great, as was the coffee on tap. However, there were some problems with the hotel. Firstly, the temperature control in the room was done by a big, clunky and old fan unit. Which means that every time the temperature drops below the thermostat level, the whole thing shudders into action and really noisily pumps air into the room. This was sufficient to wake me up several times per night. Secondly, the thermostat controls did not make sense. When I tried to use them, they came apart and I found that there was an unhealthy-looking little vial of mercury strapped to the inside with tape. But the one thing which was not welcome was the fact that soaps/shampoos were not replaced. I was at the hotel for several nights and found that after the first night, hotel soaps and shampoos which I used were not replaced, meaning that every night I had to walk down to reception to get soap and things.", "Date": "March 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saginaw, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cI Can't Complain Much But....\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4695119", "Content": "The line to get anything done at the front desk took forever.

If you're wanting to spend most of your time around the Magnificent Mile, you could probably find more convenient places, although it's almost next to the Museum Campus, the Symphony Hall and a few theatres, so it depends what your priorities are. It's also just round the corner from the Roosevelt CTA station, so it's quite easy to get around by public transport. The hotel's a pretty typical chain-type. My room was good - very big with a desk, arm chair, bed-side table with clock radio, plenty lights, a coffee machine, a good tv and a good bathroom. The only problem with my room was the heating/air conditioning. It was quite cold without heating but it's a fan heater and quite a noisy one, so you couldn't keep it on at night. Another downside was the breakfast. While it was good that some form of complimentary breakfast was provided, it was a bit haphazard! On my first day it was very nice - a decent selection of croissant, toast, egg muffins and pastries, with orange juice, tea/coffee and jam. However, on the other days I was there, at least one of those was generally unavailable. Croissants with no butter or jam, for instance. And Out of 5 days, orange juice was only there on 2.

Did I mention that the people in the next room tried to come through the adjoining door after we got settled into bed? Then there was the room, it was hardly bigger than a closet and there was no room to move around. And if there was a restaurant, it sure didn't open early enough for us to get any breakfast.
