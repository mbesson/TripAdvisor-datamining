Lovely view from the room (after complaning about the first room we were given). Large room and nice bathroom. The hotel is in the town of Kadikoy which is really lively with lots of restaurants and bars. We had some really great Turkish food and enjoyed the atmosphere. However, for an upmarket hotel, there were too many small snags for our liking: - tv constantly switching itself off - housekeeping knocking really early- 8am on a Sunday?!?! - the roof top pool was closed. No mention of this on the site before we booked - the hottest gym I have ever been in!!! - unable to use the indoor pool because we did not have bathing caps - don't take a room on the top three floors. There's a really noisy club up there which will keep you awake till the early hours It's a good hotel and the location is great. The ferry ride to Istanbul is a highlight of the experience.

Modern hotel (around 3 years I guess) with good facilities (excellent SAP and fitness centre), the sea views are outstanding. Very good reception service always welcoming you with a smile and great service. The standard rooms have the basic you would expect on a 5* hotel but depending of the floor and on your neighbours it can be quite noisy since you can easily listen what's happening on the other room, if you can get the sea side rooms! Nearby there is a great offer of good restaurants, but if you prefer to stay at the hotel go for room service, it is not cheap, but you have more choice, better service when you compare it with the ground floor restaurant. I made a couple of meals there and I can assure you don't get what you paid for, the food is not great, the service is average and it costs more than room service. On top floor you can find during spring/summer time a great swimming pool which gets converted to a bar during the night, the view is just outstanding! On the same floor there's also another restaurant which doesn't belong to the hotel, it is a local fancy/posh restaurant with a great view but quite expensive, typically full from Thursday to Sunday nights.

After not being able to find somewhere to stay on saturday night on B\u00c3\u00bcy\u00c3\u00bckada, we decided to come here. The girl that i talked on phone about reservation was only nice till i say i won't reserve suit or deluxe/corner room. After asking \"how much are standard rooms?\", i felt that i was an ordinary person in her eyes. She was not willing to give so much information and she was still trying to give me the price of corner room which is 199 euro + taxes. So we booked a standard room with land view which is 99 euro + tax ( 254 lira ) and not even a bottle of water is included in this price. Neither breakfast as you can guess. So for breakfast we had to pay 60 more so it came to 310 lira. And while you are paying, they get extra money from you as a \"deposit\" that \"if\" you use the minibar. And the extra money they get is just up to them, she settled it as 90 lira and we gave 400 lira. After paying 400 lira at 5 pm to stay one night doesn't make you feel so comfortable. And they don't give you any paper about your extra payment! I wasn't feeling secure about that. And while we were leaving she said to me wrongly \"It looks like you paid 400 lira less, can i please take it?\". My girlfriend says my expression in my face was really exhausted. Then they paid us back 85 lira after we discussed about it. Rooms are really small though for not little amount of money. Minibar is of course very unnecessarily expensive. If you want to watch any movies, which are not new surely, you have to pay and stuff. And obviously they \"somehow\" got permission to put that ugly building in middle of Moda which looks \"terrible\" from the sea. Come on, where's the aesthetic or respect to silhouette? Rooms don't even have any balcony and windows can only be opened like 5 cm (less than size of hand) And one of the most disappointing thing was breakfast for us. With my girlfriend, we always and always look forward to have good breakfast buffet and we've been told that it's awesome breakfast with more than 100 kinds of food. I think what they mean was more than 100 kinds of bread. Only 2 good things about breakfast, things were mostly fresh and they were giving you juice when you sit to table. And since this is a big building, breakfast area is really really small. In a hotel with only 13 rooms on B\u00c3\u00bcy\u00c3\u00bckada had bigger area with great sea view and way better b\u00c3\u00b6reks! :) And the girl that i talked on phone first (which i wrote that i didn't like) were trying to sell me the breakfast as well in the beginning by saying that \"if you want it now it's only 30 euro, but if you don't buy it now and do it later, it's 50 euro! ) Allah Allah yaa! :) And when we wanted to change our room and go to one which you are allowed to smoke, they sent us ashtray instead! Well to sum it, i can say it really is not worthy for this money. Nothing definitely special about this hotel apart from unnecessary luxury. To not feel guilty, i will point few good things about hotel as well: After we checked in, the guy who led us to the room, Zekeriya, was really really really nice guy. Also while we were leaving hotel in the morning with our Galatasaray jerseys for Galatasaray's match in European side, he told us we can leave the luggages and get it after if we want. He was so kind. But we normally live in European side anyways so we didn't need to that. And cookie they give you entrance is great. View and location is good of course but since i remember this hotel is ruining the view itself!, it doesn't attract me at all. Careline etc. staff on phone was helpful. I told them i think our remote's battery is out, they were directly sending someone but till someone came my girlfriend exchanged batteries places and it worked (it always works you know:)) The bed was soft and comfortable. I've written long i think, thanks for reading. I would advise you to spend your money on some other hotel with better service and lovelier staff(most of staff were not so nice), and not waste it for hilton name. Oh i forgot something. You should really check and how funny prices are about the special tours which you can find in books in your room if you go. It was really, really funny and expensive. For instance, \"Dolmabah\u00c3\u00a7e Palace tour, 1010 Euro! (thousand wouldn't be enough for sure)\", \"going to traditional Turkish barber shop, only few hundred euros!\" etc. Have a good trip!", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cDoubletree, Double worth\u201d", "Author": "inetbas", "ReviewID": "UR126005517", "Content": "Doubletree Moda is currently my default stay for a long business engagement.

First, the good points: 1) The room are fantastic. Large, well appointed. You will not be disappointed with them except see below. 2) The staff are great. 3) Kadikoy is a read Turkish town and you will get a great feeling from it and there are some great restaurants there. 4) The hotel has some very nice facilities, but also see below. If you are relatively young and active, you will enjoy this hotel. The Ferry ride is fast, efficient and a pleasure. If you are pressed for time in Istanbul, then you will need every minute and perhaps you might want to stay in Old Town or Eminenu. Now, the few issues - First, stepping into the bathtub is really high, so if you are elderly or have mobility problems, you might have problems getting into the bathtub/shower. Second, the bathrub/shower has a curtain/shade that does up and down so if you want to see the Bospherus from the bathtub, you can. However, if someone goes to the bathroom in the middle of the night and turns on the light, it will seriously light up the room. Last, if you are planing to swim, you must bring your own bathing cap, or you will have to buy one for about USD 13...this is a bummer if you don't bring one. The pool is nice, but there were working on it when we were visiting and my kids were really upset. So, bottom line is that the hotel facility and staff are fabulous. But, there are a few things you should know about where it is located, the bathtub and room. BTW, the breakfast is pretty good as well. If you are deciding on between the Doubletree Old Town and Moda, they are both nice hotels and better than any Hilton in the U.S. If you want to be right in the middle of the tourist area and need convenience, then you should go with the Old Town. if you want to be away from the tourist area and have some to spare, then stay at Moda.

Overall, we were very happy with the service, location, staff, cleanliness and comfort. Below, are some specific points with respect to our experience. Arrival: We arrived at 8:00 am on the morning of our check-in. Although check-in time is not until Noon, the hotel staff made all efforts to accommodate our early arrival and we were able to get a room before 10:00 am, which allowed us to freshen up before making our way over to the city for a day of sightseeing. Our Greeter Karem was extremely helpful upon arrival and made arrangements for us to have complimentary tea/coffee and wifi while we waited for our room to be ready. The room: We had booked the King room with deluxe view for our first 3 night stay and the king room for our last night at the hotel. The deluxe view room was certainly bigger, but we still found it to be a tight fit with our 4 pieces of luggage. Since the hotel was only 4 months old at the time of our visit, the rooms were in great shape. Our room had an excellent view of the old city, day or night. The only issue we had with this room is that on our second day we noted an odd smell coming from the bathroom, somewhat like mold or mildew (possibly from a water leak). After asking the front desk staff to investigate, they offered us another deluxe view room, but this time with a view of the Bosphorus only and not the old city. On the third day we were moved back to a room with full view of the old city, as promised by the Hotel Manager. Although, anyone would consider it a hassle to switch between 3 rooms in 3 nights, the attention given to us by the hotel staff and particularly the Manager to address the issue made up for it. Breakfast: The breakfast was great, with tons of fresh fruits, veggies, olives, pickles, meat, breads, muffins, pastries, cereal and coffee/tea/juice. The kitchen offered fresh eggs & waffles made to order. We had booked our room via expedia and booked the room & breakfast package. However, we were presented with a bill for breakfast 3 out of the 4 mornings we had breakfast at the hotel. I guess most guests do not have breakfast included with their stay and therefore the wait staff would present each guest with a bill by default. The issue was addressed each time by explaining to the wait staff, who then confirmed with the front desk that our breakfast was included. Hotel Location: The hotel is located in the Kadikoy area of Istanbul on the Asian side. At first we were concerned whether this would be a good location given the purpose of our trip was to see historical Istanbul, which is mostly on the European side. Access to the European side was quite convenient, as the hotel is less then a 10 minute walk from the Kadikoy ferry dock with ferries to Eminnou (European side) departing every 15 mins and the trip was about 20 mins. The one-way fare per person was 1.4TL and the fare tokens were easy to obtain from machines located at the ferry docks. There is also a fast ferry that departs Kadikoy for Bakirkoy via Yenikapi. Bakikoy is a 10 min drive from Ataturk international airport and there are taxis and buses available upon disembarking from the ferry, which offers a much cheaper alternative to a taxi when travelling from Kadikoy to Ataturk Airport (given you're not pulling around a lot of luggage!). We tried the fast ferry when travelling to and from the airport for a 3-day trip to the Izmir region and found it to be punctual, comfortable and very reasonably priced. Although Kadikoy is not the touristy part of Istanbul and it might be difficult to communicate with the local population (unless you speak Turkish!), we were able to get by without any problems. We ate out every night, trying something different each time. The local food joints were very reasonably priced (compared to the European side) and offered the authentic Turkish cuisine we were craving. Airport Transfer: As mentioned above, there is the option of taking the fast ferry from Ataturk Airport. However, if you've got more then 1 piece of luggage per person, a taxi might be the better option. We took a cab on our way to the hotel early on a Sunday morning and the cost was about 60 TL. However, the trip to the airport was much longer and cost about 100TL. Upon questioning the driver, he explained that he took the longer route to avoid traffic, but we're not sure if that was really the case. However, it is always best to agree on a fare before hand if possible. Also, if using the fast ferry from Kadikoy to Bakirkoy, keep in mind that he taxis running from Bakirkoy to the airport will likely take multiple fares (4 passengers) to the airport and it's advisable to clarify the fare per passenger. Hotel staff: We found the staff to be very helpful and attentive and most if not all were able to communicate in English. The Hotel Manager was very helpful in telling us about the fast ferry to the airport and even assisted us with online check-in for our domestic flight to Izmir and called Turkish Airlines on our behalf to try to upgrade our booking back to Toronto. We were also able to leave some of our luggage in the hotel's secure storage while we travelled to the Izmir area for a few days (given we were coming back to the hotel for 1 night before departing Turkey). Overall: We were very happy with our stay at the Hilton Doubletree Istanbul - Moda. It is an excellent new addition to Istanbul, and for any future trips to Istanbul, we will definitely consider this hotel again.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nicosia, Cyprus", "Title": "\u201cGood Price, Poor Location, Great View, Smelling Rooms\u201d", "Author": "matakan", "ReviewID": "UR122099834", "Content": "I have stayed in this Hotel for 3 nights at corner king room with sea view at 9th floor.

On top of the hotel there is a cute, small swimming pool. SERVICE: Reception and doormen Receptionists are ok and very friendly. They would take care of our requiremenents. However attention must be paid to the doormen. Upon arrival, they would stick to you and remove your luggage from your hands (which is something I personally dislike, as I am fit and can stroll my own luggage).

Therefore before leaving, we asked the taxi driver parked outside if he would have been happy with 25Euros (63 Turkish liras) Once received our luggage, however, the doorman went with it to the taxi driver, even before we had put together all our stuff. Once we were sat in the taxi he said we had to pay 30Euros (75 liras). To my great disappointment, we asked the reason and he said that the driver did not speak English and he had misunderstood. We were already inside, so we decided not to complain- but I do regret the tip I had given the doormen, who obviously has his own agreement with the drivers. Once at destination the cost of the taxi was 61liras (and we still paid 30 Euros!!) HOUSE KEEPING SERVICE The weakest point of this hotel. In our fridge we found leftovers from the previous guests. There was hair in the toilet and the towels were folded like in a 2 stars hotel.

Bellhops, Front Desk, Fitness Center, Restaurants- all fantastic. A special thank you to Bilge @ the Front Desk who was able to ensure every facet of the stay was excellent. He was very helpful with telling me which ferries to take to different destinations as well as times during important trips like to the airport. One suggestion for the staff: I found that the staff's English language acquisition is a bit lower than other hotels I've stayed @ in Istanbul. Since this is an international chain, many people reserving this hotel will use English as the default \"international\" language and it would be wise for the hotel to invest in their staff's abilities to learn more English. 2) Great Fitness and Pool facilities. They were top notch. To be able to be in a metropolis like Istanbul and have not only one pool but TWO. Wow. And each one is great. The fitness area is superb. One of the best of any hotel I have EVER stayed in- anywhere on the planet! 3) Breakfast- Excellent in the mornings. A super spread and very nice staff as well. Enormous set of choices. The pastries seemed very fresh- like something you might get at one of the great small independent hotels in Istanbul- just with a HUGE selection. Basically it was a breafast fit for a king or queen! 4) 360 upstairs had a great view as well as great staff. The food was oh kay and the drinks were pretty good. 5) Room Service, by the way, is a STEAL! No service charges or hidden fees! There's so much great food in Istanbul, but I got back to the hotel really late and needed something to eat. And the price on the menu is what you get charged! Tell me where else you've ever been where that is the case! 6) Great views- The views from the rooms are pretty darn spectacular. The hotel truly has a prime piece of real estate on the Anatolian side. 7) The rooms- Excellent, modern flair without being either to trendy or too current in a way that will get outdated too quickly. Great bathrooms, beds, modern tv's and tv stands. Everything was top notch. The only problems were: a) sometimes the curtains were hard to close because the tracking didn't seem to always work that well; b) the cooling system in the corner rooms did not reach the bed area very well- so it tended to be much warmer on that side of the room; and c) there is no covering to the glass in the bathrooms in the corner room; therefore, someone in the room could actually see someone sitting on the toilet and that is not a comforting thought! 8) Location- It works out beautifully! Getting from the airport is a cinch. And in some ways may be easier to get to than many other areas in the city on either side. If you take a taxi to the Bakirkoy Ferry, which costs somewhere between 18-22 TL, you only then need to hop on the Ferry to Kadikoy for 7TL. The trip, door to door, is less than an hour easily and it is only a 3-5 minute walk to the hotel. Tops! You bypass all the traffic in Istanbul by doing this as well. You may, as a tourist or business person be thinking you will be out of your way by being on the Anatolian side. Well DON'T FRET! It's very easy to get to the other side. There are so many ferries within a 5 minute walk of the hotel to the other side. It's such an inexpensive and beautiful way to see the city. I've been to Istanbul before and had not used the ferries. It makes for a very relaxing part of the trip. And a very scenic trip! I could go on more, but that is enough! Great place.

The hotel is only 5 min walk from lots of bars and restaurants with Asian price tags, not the tourist price you pay in Sultanamet or the ones of the hotel! It is also 5 min walk from the Kadikoy ferry port from where you can go to the old / new town in under 30min and to many other parts of istanbul such as Karikoy, Ortakoy etc all nice places to visit / have a meal or drink!

We've had a wonderful experience and simply can't believe the writeups about poor maintenance, service or bugs in the bed at midnight. Since when did bugs learn to tell time? We were given a corner suite with beautiful views of the city and the Bosphorous and our room has been cleaned everyday immaculately. Not only that, but we had dinner in the ground floor restaurant tonight and the food was delicious and the restaurant manager came to our table several times to ask about the food and the service. When we completed our meal we were too full to have dessert or even coffee, but the manager insisted and comped both and sent it to our room an hour after dinner with no obligation to tip the waiter. Of course, we did as we were impressed by the great service. In addition, my wife happened to mention at checkin how much she liked the chocolate chip cookies and that there was something different about these compared to the cookies served at Doubletree's in the States, so they have sent four warm cookies (2 for her and 2 for me) to our room each evening. As they say, it's the little things that count. The hotel is very convenient to the ferries to the European side of the city and the hotel staff bends over backwards to help, although they are as new as the hotel and some don't have control of the English language yet. But, at least they try to be as helpful as they can or will go get someone else if they don't quite understand what you're asking. Bottom line is that my experience here doesn't mesh with the bad reviews that I've been reading. Granted it's a new hotel and it will take a few months to work out some of the kinks. But, maintenance, service and dining aren't a problem here, so don't shy away from booking this property if you're going to Istanbul and looking for a good hotel.

Overall, my stay was very pleasant. the hotel staff went out of their way to assist me in findind directions, changing money, or anything else that I needed. The metal detectors were a bit odd, but I guess that is standard for Istanbul. The room was very clean and comfortable, yet was a bit on the small side. My room faced the area of Kadikoy and not the Sea of Mamara (which was ok). My only real complaint was the bathroom, and in partiular, the shower. In a word it was \"dangerous\"! The sliding glass door would only partially open, preventing you from entering the shower with any degree of comfort or safety. The tub was too short for the opening of the glass door that you only had about a foot of space to enter the shower. lastly, the valves were overly complicated and you would have to guess which function was in effect - the bottom nozzle, the overhaed shower, or the wall nozzle. It was a roulette game I plaved evry morning (and usually lost by getting cold water squirted on me!). Last point I want to make: This is a good hotel (note not excellent), but it tries to perport it is more upscale than it really is. Witness: they would kick everyone out of the rooftop pool area at 1800, so that they can set up for the bar. Well, some of us get back from work at 1730 and would like to use the facility for more than 30 minutes! One night there were two young girls dancing on the bar tops (employed by the hotel) after the pool area closed and the bar was open - very gauche I thought.
