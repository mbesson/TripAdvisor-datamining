A major drawback was the absence of free in-room wireless internet, although a wired connection was available. In an age of e-readers and ubiquitous wireless devices, I find this ridiculous. The free breakfast buffet was more than adequate. In addition to the usual cereal, muffins, etc. there was a pancake machine that produced perfectly edible fare.

AIR COND / HEATER One air cond / heater was provided. STAFF Very friendly and helpful. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what to do next, just drop by the front desk for ideas. BATHROOM Soap, shampoo. If required you can request for a tooth brush, shaver, shaving cream, comb, etc which is provided free of charge. Clean bathroom. Good water pressure with hot and cold water. BREAKFAST Breakfast was provided. This is the standard Holiday Inn Express breakfast. The spread was sufficient with burger / bacon, eggs, muffin, bread, bagel, pancake, yogurt, cinnamon roll, juice, coffee & tea. Although a good variety, you can easily get tired of it as we stayed in Holiday Inn Express in Vancouver, San Francisco, Grand Canyon, and LA and it was ALWAYS the same breakfast. OTHER COMMENTS There was no additional hidden charges such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort fees\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which is charged by most hotels. I paid about $150 a night for a three-night stay on Wed - Friday which I think was affordable when sharing among 4 people. No Free Parking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drive so it was not a problem. Parking in SanFran is very expensive. Near the wharf it is $2 per half hour. There was free Wifi but the signal was not strong enough in the room. We had to go down to the lobby to use the Wifi. If you plan to get work done in your hotel room and require Wifi, then you will be dissapointed. LOCATION Five minute walk away from the main eating and shopping area at the wharf. A convenience store, Walgreens was also nearby. We could easily catch the cable car or tramp to Union Square or the Lombard Street, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most crookedest street. SURPRISES The town closes quite early. We went out for dinner at 8pm and most shops were already closed. OVERALL I paid US$150 per night and stayed on the 7th \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10th Mar 2012. A satisfactory experience as this is a family hotel and nothing too fancy.

One of the greatest things about Holiday Inn Express is that the very reasonable rate also included parking! this is a VERY GOOD THING if you've ever tried to park in town. We drove to town, parked our car and never used it again until we left. It was all safe in the garage and the valet brought it up when we were ready to leave. Very nice! Breakfast is buffet style, very basic but good and it gets you out the door and on your adventure. The location is less than 5 minutes walk to Fisherman's Wharf, and Pier 39. The famous Lombard street zigs & zags, and the ferry to Alcatraz is about a 20 minute walk.. There is a TON of San Francisco sights and sounds at Fisherman's Wharf, and you're also within walking distance of Ghirardelli Square, Maritime Park, Fort Mason Green -and that's just in one direction. Walk the other way and follow the Embarcaderro all the way around to Rincon Park! and good luck choosing a place to eat, there are just TOO MANY to pick just one.

The hotel as a whole was a perfect fit for us, it's close to everything you could want to see in San Fransisco. The hotel is clean, my kids loved the breakfasts in the morning. The one experience I personally had was of a paranormal nature, can't say that I used to actually believe in ghosts, but I do now. Our room was on the 3rd floor, the room was always hot during the day, I called maintenance for this issue, at night it was like a freezer in the room. My bed was closest to the window, along the opposite wall is the double mirrored closets, while laying in bed you have a clear view of the bathroom. The second night of our stay, I awoke at 2:30 am to see who I thought was my son, head bent sitting on the commode looking at his phone. the room is totally dark and when the i phones light is on, it kind of glows like a flashlight . I at first didn't think anything of it, 17 yr old teens use their phones at all hours. I went back to sleep, and at 3:00 woke up again, only this time I called his name, asking what was he still doing on his phone, the person that looked up at me wasn't my son. I slammed on the light next to my bed, only to find my two sons asleep in the bed next to me. I was struck numb and speechless, with the nightstand light on, I could tell that the person wasn't solid. I always thought that it would be fun to see a spirit, after my experience, I think a bit differently. I was so scared I couldn't leave my bed at all that night. We all had weird things happening with our phones, the lights in the room, after that 2nd night we slept with the door closed. We wanted to change rooms and used the air conditioning as an excuse, the hotel was fully booked. I then called the manager from my cell, to ask if there was any experiences like this on the 3rd floor. I was embarrassed and a bit freaked out. they said no but asked for me to please tell them what room I was in, I caved and told them our experience. They were very sympathetic and said that I was the first person that this happened to, they explained to me that the hotel is fairly new, and they didn't know of any deaths in room 315. I really struggled with the idea of sharing our experience, I know that I would've liked to know if someone else had these weird experiences.

I would guess that the hotel has been built or renovated within the past two years. Staff were friendly and professional. One of the best features of the hotel, however, is simply its location. The hotel is located less than 10 minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk from Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf, Pier 39, the Alcatraz Ferry, Ghirardelli Square, both cablecar lines, and numerous tram and bus lines. The Golden Gate Bridge is viewable from several of these locations. This is a great location if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re touring the city. In summary, this hotel provides unspectacular but consistent quality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you would expect at a nice, new Holiday Inn Express. Furthermore, the hotel charges a reasonable rate (in a very expensive city) and it has a great location.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Myrtle Beach, SC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!!\u201d", "Author": "Hankaren", "ReviewID": "UR123938908", "Content": "We stayed for a week in this hotel last September.

Spent 7 days there in a standard, but spacious double room on the front looking towards the Hyatt Hotel. Used the hopon-hopoff city sightseeing buses recommended by the Virgin rep (one block away and around the corner) so handy for doing the many sights of San Francisco. Highlights of our trip were definitely the night tour of Alcatraz (book online in advance with the official site for the inside tour otherwise you will just sail around it), walking the Golden Gate Bridge, exploring Golden Gate Park, lunching in Scomas in Sausalito outside in the sun (where Otis Redding apparently wrote 'Sitting on the Dock of the Bay' on a houseboat), exploring the tall ship/boats/submarine at Fishermans's Wharf, riding the cable cars and seeing crooked Lombard Street, exploring Chinatown, eating Clam Chowder in the Blue Mermaid, drinks in Jacks Bar, Irish coffee in Buena Vista and dining in the many restaurants in Little Italy - about 15 mins walk up Columbus. For us, we preferred to dine in Little Italy as we found the Wharf too big, brash, touristy and tacky (with a sprinkling of homeless and drunks wandering around) restaurant-wise it's probably great with kids, but as we were a couple we preferred the smaller more intimate restaurants up on Columbus. However, we did eat dinner in Knuckles (The Hyatt's restaurant opposite) and Pompei's Grotto on the Wharf (where we had the cheapest bottle of house wine in all the restaurants we visited) when we were tired and didn't want to walk far after sightseeing. We did find house wine very expensive with our meals, much more expensive than at home, and don't really understand why when all the Californian vineyards are only an hour or so away up the coast. Another night, when we were too tired, we just got a take-away pizza (recommended by reception) and a bottle of wine from the local supermarket and stayed in our spacious and comfortable room watching TV. The Holiday Inn Express itself was busy with friendly helpful reception staff but no bar or restaurant in-house. The breakfasts, just off the lobby, were hectic and plentiful, but not the healthiest - mainly consisting of burgers, burnt bacon, rubbery eggs, bread, pancakes, scones, very sweet pastries, tea, coffee, juice and some cereals including one rainbow coloured cereal (dread to think how many colourings and sugar in that one!!). The only healthy thing on the buffet was a banana and even the yoghurts were like the little kiddie ones once again full of colouring and sugar. Needlesstosay, I wasn't overly impressed with breakfast and even worse it's all on paper plates with plastic, knives and forks. But then, you could argue that breakfast was included in the room rate so it was cheaper than eating out every morning. There are two internet terminals, to the right as you come into reception, which were handy if they weren't busy and also useful for printing out info and our boarding passes. Overall, we were glad we booked the Holiday Inn Express and on our last day we enjoyed sitting by the pool of its sister hotel, the Holiday Inn, nextdoor so we could savour a little bit of Californian sunshine even in November. A nice suntrap, but disappointing you couldn't order a drink or food by the pool during the day (maybe it's different in the summer).", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chino, California", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel within walking distance of most attractions\u201d", "Author": "luv2travel25_11", "ReviewID": "UR123864539", "Content": "We loved our stay in San Fran.

Breakfast is not the Ritz but it offers cereal, toast, bananas, yoghurt, pancakes, bacon or sausage and yes, powdered scrambled eggs. However, if you are staying for a week as we did, we appreciated the saving on having to buy brekky each day. Overall there's very little to find fault with. Beds are extremely comfortable...a pleasant change from our stay in Thailand last year! My only complaint is the lack of wireless Internet in the rooms. There is an Ethernet connection but this is no good for using an iPad which a lot of travelers do now. There is wireless connection in the lobby but after a long day sightseeing we didn't really want to sit down in the lobby to use the Internet. The room TVs haven't yet been updated to flat screens.

You had to fight to find a table and because of the mass amount of people there it wasn't the cleanest and obviously hard for the two staff we could see to maintain it.

In the main building there was a Cafe/Coffee Shop which served breakfast although we never ate there and our building contained a Denny's Restaurant.

The hotel pool was located in the main building and although it is not very large (and the water was cold), it was nice to sit in the pool area and relax after a long day sight seeing.

The air conditioning is noisy - so is the bathroom exhaust. The TV looked old in the age of flat screen televisions. No wireless internet in the room - just a wired one. You are out of luck with an iPad. But there is wireless in the lobby and a couple of free computers in the lobby. There is a touchscreen information facility near the computers but the touchscreen is dodgy. The room safe is key operated which is weird. No room fridge or minibar. The room did not have a view - you get a window facing other rooms. Breakfast is loaded with sugar. No healthy choices like oatmeal - brown bread was good quality though. Most hotels in California had oatmeal but this one did not. It can get very busy at breakfast - go early for a seat. Hotel is very clean and they are keen on composting everything. I found it strange as the breakfast was served in paper plates and cutlery was plastic. We booked a taxi the night before only to be told that there is no record of this when we had to go to the airport. Luckily it was early morning and there were taxis lining up outside the hotel. The Amtrak bus drop off point is close by and you can walk to hotel - looked safe at night. Just don't disturb the homeless on the streets. It gets a bit quiet at night. Anyway the charm of San Francisco made up for the hotel shortcmings. It is a beautiful city. We only had two full days but we saw so much of the city on foot. Don't miss the following whilst you are there: 1. Come to San Francisco by Amtrak - Amtrak train comes to oakland and their thruway bus (must be booked with the ticket) goes on the Oakland Bay bridge into San Francisco. The views from the bay bridge cannot be matched esp. at night. They will drop you at Fisherman's wharf where you can walk to the hotel. 2. Ghirardelli Square: You get great views of Golden Gate and Alcatraz from here. Very charming and a must walk from the hotel. 3. Fisherman's wharf: Not much to do here unless you like seafood. Walgreens is very close by for grocery, souvenirs etc (come out of hotel, turn right and then a right again). There is a McDonalds, Burger king, Chipotle etc. I'm a vegetarian - so ate at Gino's pizza and Chipotle. Boudin bakery is a must see for their wonderfully shaped breads. 4. Walk along the piers all the way to Ferry Building: A great walk and lively in the evenings. You'll find many people jogging and the views are fantastic. The night time view of financial district and bay bridge from Pier 14 is superb. 1 hour walk from the hotel at a slow pace. 5. Muir Woods, Sausalito & Golden Gate: Get a tour company to take you there from the hotel. Wonderful redwood and a charming town in Sausalito. They normally give you an hour at each place. Muir woods is always damp - take an umbrella and warm clothes. If you get motion sickness, sit in the front seat. The road is windy. 6. Alcatraz : We did not get time to do this but it is worth visiting. 7. Walk on Lombard Street all the way to crookedest street: It is a hilly walk - so wear good shoes. You also get great views of the city from Coit tower and Telegraph hill. 8: Ferry building: very nice charming place with views of the bridge. The shops sell some really good gourmet stuff. Yerba Buena garden was also very nice. The hotel receptionist will give you a map and I would say - just walk. You'll love the city and the views. Tip: Stay away from Tenderloin i.e don't wander off Geary and Market street (esp. at night).", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and price\u201d", "Author": "Michel1030", "ReviewID": "UR120789573", "Content": "We stayed here for 4 nights while visiting our daughter and were very happy.

We did ask for a non smoking room , went up to the room to find out it had been smoked in and smelt heavily , we went down to reception and they organised a non smoking room 2nd time round was all good . Ok room was small , and no view at all except... for other hotel rooms , but wasnt a big deal. There is no wireless in the bedrooms but the pay of is its free in the foyer... Breakfast was included in the room rate , and was yummy lots to choose from and a great place to fill up before a day of tourist attractions.

Fruit was good. 6) Hotel parking is valet and $45/day! 7) Wall-paper thin. A door closing normally down the hall would shake our room too. We will never stay there again.

The hotel is located right at the heart of Fisherman's Wharf, which is convenient for tourists who want to take advantage of bus tours and sightseeing. My friend and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. Check in is at 3pm but we arrived at 12:30pm. We were told to return at 3pm and our reservation was confirmed. We came back at 3:10pm and were advised that our room had been given away to a large group of young students that were here as a group. They offered us a king size bed and a free movie to compensate. After a bit of haggling, we got upgraded to a mini suite for the duration of our stay, which was just a slightly larger room with 2 beds, a pullout couch, a microwave and mini fridge. I can only imagine how small the regular rooms must be. Despite the mixup, the staff was extremely helpful and friendly and quickly got us settled. For those travelers that don't like being in a touristy area then this hotel is not for you. For those that don't mind, the location is perfect. It is a very short walk to Ghiardelli Square, the crookedest street, and the Alcatraz ferry pickup. Also, there is free hotel pickup for the bus tours that we selected. If you don't know where to eat, you can walk along the pier and decide from a range of different places to eat. Most of the restaurants have a seafood theme so be prepared for crab and clam chowder on most of the menus. The buses, street cars, and cable cars are also a short distance from the hotel so you can explore the rest of the city quite easily. The only negative thing I would say about the location is the large amount of homeless people that appeared to be mentally ill. Walking back to the hotel at night was a bit worrisome for two young women as the homeless people sleep on the sidewalk on the walk back to the hotel. One man even approached us on the pier, rambling about something. We ignored them and were fine but it is a bit unsettling. The negative thing about the hotel would be the slow internet connection. There is a business centre with two computers and we had to wait in line most of the time that we wanted to check our e-mails. once you get a computer, you will be waiting for a few minutes for each page to load which can get frustrating. I suggest bringing a laptop or device that can access the computers and check the internet from the comfort of your room. And the people who were complaining about the breakfast are obviously too picky.

We travelled from England to stay for a week. This hotel provided a good price from the outset. We checked in really easily on a Memorial Day weekend Saturday. On booking in I asked if we had a twin room as I was with my Mum. We were booked into a double. Despite the busy day the receptionist could not have been nicer! She initially told us that they were full and that we could have a roll away bed. Then she commented that we were there for a week and should be better looked after and found us a twin room. The hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from Fishermans Wharf in one direction and the cable car turning table in another. The Market Street trolley goes from a block away taking you right up to the vicinity of Union Square. And that costs just $2 each. The room was fantastic. Immaculately clean, in good condition and with good facilities. Mum was pleased to get a good quality coffee from the machine in the bathroom. The shower was good and the beds extremely comfortable. Breakfast is part of the cost. Obviously not amazing and more of a buffet style. There is a hot breakfast with scrambled eggs and bacon. I personally found these rather hideous but everyone else seemed to eat them. Their cinnamon rolls were to die for though and there was plenty of choice for breakfast cereal. I was a little surprised that there was no Wifi in the rooms although this was available in the lobby. There is internet access in the rooms but via a cable so you would need a lap top. Fortunately I had brought along my laptop.

Well, our reservation was made for the Holiday Inn (not 'Express') across the road. The manager there was very argumentative and would not accept that fact that there had been a mistake and we were placed in a totally different hotel than our friends. He did not want us to leave and he was not going to honor the rate we had booked... he kept making excuses... like they might not have rooms for us, and if they did, the rooms at the Express would be smaller or they didn't have the number of beds we requested. (he was mad because he said the hotels had different ownership/management-- understandable by really not our problem when we requested to be in the other hotel) Finally after 10 uncomfortable minutes explaining the situation and making our point very clear that the reservations line made the mistake, he called The Holiday Inn EXPRESS to see if they room for us.

We ate at Boudins (Fishermen's Wharf) and had some great meals upstairs. Downstairs is a cafe with some nice sandwiches and salads for something quick and cheap. If you walk down a couple of blocks towards Ghiradelli Square there is a Cold Stone, we had that for dessert most nights. We had been to San Francisco before and drove around but we wanted to hear more about the city so we went on a organized tour through Great Pacific. My husband and I and our 13 yr old really enjoyed this, we learned so much and our driver was great. He remembered everyone's names and answered all our questions, I think his name was Malcolm. I would highly recommend it. We also went on a free walking tour of Chinatown, I enjoyed it, but my kids got a little antsy. (It was very cold that morning) Volunteers lead walking tours all over San Francisco for free, just look around on the internet, they really know the city. The Pacific Heights mansion tour looked interesting but we didn't have the time. The family suite was very large and we loved the free internet. My daughter left her pink football in the room and we called when we got home and housekeeping mailed it to us. I was very pleased with our stay and would stay again.", "Date": "January 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lomita, CA", "Title": "\u201cWould recommend - good value and service\u201d", "Author": "Sunny_Skies06", "ReviewID": "UR52420553", "Content": "Wasnt thrilled about paying for parking but not much choice if you decide to stay around Fishermans Wharf.

The hotel is literally round the corner from the 'route f' trolley car which goes down embarcadero near pier 39 and also pier 33 (where you catch the ferry to alcatraz).

We were a little disappointed when we checked in because we were not greeted as Priority club members. Usually at check in you are greeted and given water or cookies. Not the end of the world, but a little touch we have received at every other Holiday Inn Express, and we like it. Hotel staff was friendly and courteous. The room was a little small but clean. No view, unless you like looking at the concrete walls and other peoples rooms. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The bathroom was clean. The breakfast was good. Eggs, bacon, cereal, bagels, toast, ect. They had their great cinnamon buns but they were luke warm at best. They stack the buns on top of each other so they don't have to refill so often but in doing that they never have a chance to heat up. They are still good but definitely not the same as when they are fresh and warm! It gets really busy! I noticed they stopped putting out fresh buns at around 8:30. Once they stop putting out fresh food your selection goes down FAST! I would suggest getting there before 8:30 if you want a good hearty breakfast. They provide a decent size seating area but it is always full, so search for a seat before you get your food and have another family member hold it. Did not use the fitness room but it looked nice and big. We always use their computer as we would rather not bring our laptop. Their lobby is large. Overall, we had an average stay. Just thought it was kind of pricey for the size and quality of the room. Again, nothing fancy or special, but you will have a comfortable stay.", "Date": "August 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dundee,Scotland", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, lovely hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Anne-Mari08", "ReviewID": "UR36502849", "Content": "We stayed here from 9th to 12th July and had a really good time.

Rented a car for a day trip to Muir Woods and Napa/Sonoma. $71 for the day from Enterprise (they provided exact directions to both and maps) - could drop off car after hours. Great upscale sports bar across the street for dinner - Knuckles. Good food & happy hour. Very small room - seemed smaller than a room on a cruise ship. The bathroom was big though w/ bathtub/shower combo. Had a queen size bed and the view was of other rooms and the roof. The air conditioning never really worked. We put it all the way down the first day and it never cooled. Wasn't too bad though since it's cold out. TV only has about 7 or 8 channels.

Public transportation in San Francisco is great. Tips: If riding the cable cars, the line at the turn-arounds is long and cold. Buy your tickets ($5 for a ride or $11 for the day unlimited rides) and jump on at an intersection. Or just pay the $5 when you jump on. We rode it from Fisherman's Wharf to Union Square and then walked back. Wear layers. You can buy a $10 San Francisco fleece on the streets. I always had it with me - very windy, nights are cold. Wear sneakers. The hills are tough to walk wearing anything else. Alcatraz is a must-see! Bay Quackers was fun. If you can do a day-trip out of the city, it's worth it.

Our room, single king bed, was more than adequate. Maid service was good. The breakfast was decent for a hotel complimentery breakfast. There was a good selection to get your day started - juice, coffee, tea, milk, cereals, toast, bagels, yogurt, bananas, eggs (either scrambled or omlette which seemed to be prepacked and microwaved), bacon and/or sausage. The hotel was full on the weekend and the breakfast bar was quite busy at times. I felt the hotel did a great job of refilling things and we never had to wait long for anything. We always also managed to find a table for our group of 4. There were a couple of minor things we noted. While the hotel looked great, it is very basic and didn't have any nice little \"extras\". I thought it would have been nice to have coffee/tea service in the lobby area throughout the day, not just until 9:30 am - we've had this at other Holiday Inn Express hotels and basic type hotels such as Quality Inns, etc. Some aspects of service could have been a little better as well. I wanted to have a tea in my room early one evening. I had forgot to take a milk back up to the room in the morning - tea with powdered whitener just isn't that great. I had hoped that the front desk could get me a milk - the breakfast room was just a few steps away - but they were unable to help as their \"house man\" was not on duty. While I was waiting at the front desk an older man approached and indicated that they had just returned from their day out and their room hadn't been cleaned. The gentleman at the front desk indicated that he \"couldn't understand how that could happen, it had never happened before\". He asked the guest if he was sure he didn't leave his Do Not Disturb sign on the door. The guest replied he was sure he hadn't. The front desk clerk then proceeded to tell the gentlemant there was nothing he could for him as the cleaning staff were gone for the day and again, the house man was not in. The front desk clerk didn't offer anything to the guest for the inconvenience - he just restated he couldn't understand how that could happen. To me, surely someone could have gone up and emptied the garbages and at least gave them clean towels? Also, don't forget that parking is very expensive, as is pretty standard with wharf area hotels. We didn't have a vechicle but noticed that the valet parking was over $40 per night.

There is no alternative!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Czarmax18", "ReviewID": "UR28247341", "Content": "I was out in California for a 2 week business trip. I wanted to fill the weekend with fun things to do since I have not been to California before. This stay started off by waiting to check in for 15 minutes while the person working the check in desk went through every possible thing to do in San Francisco with a couple. By the time she was done with them, the check in line was 4 people deep. I stay at numerous Holiday Inn's and I am a Priority Club Platinum member so I asked if they had any Platinum upgrades. The person behind the desk stated that they did have something available and that she would upgrade me. After we got that taken care of I asked her about the parking situation. They are extremely close to the Fisherman's Wharf I was figuring that they would have free parking for guests or at maximum $10-$20 charge. I find out that the only parking that they have available is valet parking that costs $41 plus applicable taxes that brings the total over $45!!! I asked the person behind the counter if there are any other options, and she stated that she used to tell people to go down the block because they were only $20. She continued to say that now the prices have gone up, and that they are no longer that cheap. No other follow up was done with me. She stated that they do not own the parking area, so that there were no breaks for Platinum members or anyone else for that matter. I over heard the poor lady next to me telling the other family that she was traveling with that the charge is $50 a day per car. They had 2 cars staying for 2 days. That is an extra $200!!! Afterward I did see that there is a $41 Valet Parking charge on their website after I dug around a little bit, and I would have figured that they would have other options than valet parking. I never do valet parking, so I figured that I would just park in the local ramp. Like I have stated I travel a lot for business, and nothing has caught me so off guard as paying 1/3 of the amount that I paid for a room in parking. I was unfamiliar with the area, and I did not feel comfortable driving around trying to find another place to park. To be fair there are numerous hotels around along with this one in this area, and I believe that they all charge close to this much for parking. After the whole parking shocker, I went up to the \"upgraded\" room. I had originally booked a normal room with a king bed. The \"upgraded\" room had 2 queen beds. Apparently the \"upgrade\" means that you get a microwave and an extra small sink. No refrigerator or anything else that would constitute \"upgrade\" in my book. I went back down to the desk and got my room back with the king bed. I figure that is pretty bad that after an upgrade you go back to the original room that you originally had. The room I had was extremely tiny, and the view out of the window was another room in the hotel. Overall decor in the hallways in the rooms was nice, but absolutely nothing over the top or even special for that matter. If you are thirsty go to the Walgreens up the road since bottled water and other beverages in the vending machine start at $3.00. I had to go down and exchange a towel since it was dirty. Only 2 bath towels were given in the room, so if there is more than one person that wants to take more than one shower you need to use wet towels. The bed makes a funny noise when I sit on it. I do not know what else to say about this, but I wanted to note it. They had wired internet in the room that I was in. I was able to find a wireless signal from this hotel and I called down to the desk to get the access code, and the person that answered stated wireless internet is not available in the rooms. I continued to tell her that it is asking for my Holiday Inn Express access code and she then proceeded to tell me what the pass code is. This just added to the frustration. Overall it really started off on the wrong foot realizing that I had to pay almost $50 just to park, and it really did not get any better. Due to the times I really wanted to stay fiscally responsible for my business trip, and this extra charge took me way over the acceptable costs for a hotel room. Now I am going to have to explain this situation to my supervisors and try and justify the extra charges. I am currently writing this review the night that I am staying at this hotel. I am taking time out of my trip on Friday night to warn people of what they may walk into with this hotel. There is no pool, but they allow you to use the pool from the adjacent Holiday Inn hotel. Like I have stated I travel a lot for business and I stay at Holiday Inn brand hotels 50+ times throughout the year. This one is absolutely the lowest value for the dollar that I have stayed in. The location is nice, but if you are planning on staying more than one night be aware you may be dishing out close to $100 for parking.

Since we like to walk, we walked the distance to China Town and Union St. We also walked along the water from near the hotel all the way to the Golden Gate bridge which is about 2 miles. On a nice day it is amazingly scenic, so I recommend taking in some sites that way. This hotel was pretty much purpose-only. It was nothing special to look at from the outside and inside. The room was just your basic hotel room and our view was of a wall. We had a handicap room I think because the shower had handrails and a big bench. The bench took up most of the shower so you had to stand pretty much against the wall and the water pressure was weak. Luckily the showerhead detached so you could rinse more efficiently that way. At least the mattress was really comfortable. That is a bonus while on vacation and trying to catch up on sleep. Unfortunately a travel agent got this room for us and I paid full price on a weekend of $230+ a night and wish I had gotten a different hotel for that price or tried Hotwire.com. Besides, Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf is a good location, but you can see that in about an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time so if I could go back, I would prefer to be more in the heart of the city near Union St. The breakfast was a big bonus for us since we were eating all meals out for our week long trip to northern California. Since we were up early due to the time change from the east coast, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to fight crowds for food at 7:00 am. At 9:00 when we were headed out to start the day in the city, the breakfast area was packed. But even so, you could get your coffee and something to eat pretty easily.

We spent two days in San Fran so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pick up our rental car until we were leaving for Monterey since the parking at the hotel is $40 and the closest garage had a sign for $30 a day.

The breakfast was the same most days - extra extra crispy bacon, sausage, eggs, cereal, muffins, bagels w/ cream cheese, bananas, warm cinnamon rolls, yogurt, milk, coffee, etc. The hotel only offers valet parking at $41/day + tax. So take this into account when reserving your room.

We couldn't book in straight away as the rooms were not ready, this was not a problem as they could store the luggage for us and we could go sightseeing. However , we were told that the hotel does not have any inter-connecting rooms and that the best they could do was give us 2 rooms side by side. That was the only down side. (Do not know why the guy on the phone couldn't tell me this.) The staff were very helpful. The breakfast was reasonable. - only fruit choice was bananas. The location was fantastic - walking distance to most things. Great restaurants near by. The kids enjoyed the Rainforest cafe. The Christmas decorations throughout San Francisco were beautiful. Even the historic cable cars get decorated for the occassion. Fisherman's wharf was extremely crowded at this time of year - was a bit unprepared for that.

Definitely recommend this hotel. Great location. 5 mins walk to tourist area of Fisherman's Wharf. FW itself is somewhat \"tacky\" and 100% focused on tourism, but the hotel is far enough to be away from that, yet close enough to walk there! - Buffet breakfast was very nice - 6.30am to 9.30am. Standard cereal, toast, pasteries etc. tea/coffee/juice. Can take back to room too. - Nice room, no problems with maid service/cleaniness etc. - all excellent. - Plenty of shuttle bus companies from SF airport to FW area - anywhere from $11 - $17 each way. Look for coupons on the hotel map flyers to book your return shuttle. - For souvenier shopping, I would suggest check out Chinatown FIRST, then stroll to Fisherman's Wharf. Generally, Chinatown is cheaper and has the same range. - For tours, I went with Gray Line through San Francisco Sightseeing Tours. I took the Muir Woods tour (with ferry back from Salsolito) and the Yosemite tour. Both very good. If I could only pick one, it would be Yosemite. - Book your Alcatraz tour through the offifical website - about $26 US. Really worth seeing and the audio tour is great. On the audio tour, skip following the official route and work your own way around - you can still listen and get the general idea and miss the crowds. - Take the walk from the hotel to the GG Bridge. Allow about an hour there and an hour back. Completely flat trail along the bay and then a stepped climb for the last part next to the bridge. You'll know it was worth it! - If you're vegetarian/vegan there are plenty of places to eat in SF - way more than other cities I've visited. - Cable car ride (must do!) is $5 regardless of trip length.

Moreover, the path to/from is not too hilly relative to other parts of SF. -The lobby floor has a bathroom, which is useful if you are squeamish about using the disgusting ones around Fisherman's Wharf. -Though the valet was indeed expensive (a given with a hotel in a good location), the cost includes in/out privileges. Valets were quick at both check in and out, and always asked if you needed directions. -Breakfast gets really crowded, so get there before 8:00 if you want to eat in relative peace. -The bathroom products have a cinammon scent... could be good or bad depending on your take.

The concierge, Rhoda, was particularly helpful, as was their comically dressed bellboy, who was great at whistling down cabs and providing directions. If you are staying at this hotel try and get onto the 5th floor. This is the floor with the business centre. We stayed in room 506 which was large, clean and very well equipped with everything expected from a quality hotel. The king sized bed was also fantastic. We did not have any meals at the hotel as it is located very close to Walgreens supermarket. We saved lots of money buying fresh fruit and groceries from this store. The room also had a microwave oven which came in handy heating up a few TV meals. The coffee making machine was also a nice touch, especially for my wife! Fishermans Wharf is a great place to stay. Even though it is very touristy, its where the action is and there is lots of cheap clothing and characterful shop assistants. San Francisco is a superb city. For a fun filled day, if you have the energy catch a cab to Haight Ashbury, walk from Masonic down Haight St and check out all the great shops and survivors of the hippy and punk eras. Keep walking through Golden Gate Park ( about a 2 hour walk) visit the attractions and get right down to the Pacific Ocean. Just keep heading west towards the sun.

The internet was not working in our building as well. I am certain that we were given a single room because when collecting quarters a man at the front desk said we wanted to move from one and the number of his room put it in the same position as ours but on a different floor.

Most of the Fishermans Wharf hotel were coming in at about the same price, so went with what looked like best value. The HI Express offers a free breakfast every morning, so that sealed the deal for us. Location can't be faulted, it's right in the middle of the Wharf. You can walk to pretty much anywhere within 5 mintues, including Pier 39 and cable car turnarounds. It is on North Point Street, a fairly quite street from our experience. Our room overlooked the street, and we had absolutely no complaints about road noise, or noise from other rooms for that matter. We were on the 4th (top) floor, right at the end of the corridor, which must have helped keep noise levels down. With only 4 floors, there was never a long wait for the elevator. The hotel looks very new, everything feels fresh, and everything was spotlessly clean. No complaints whatsoever, and the daily housekeeping did a good job. The bed itself was very comfy, though the room itself wasn't that large. Fine for the two of us, but you couldn't have fitted anyone else in there. Not a problem though, as we weren't there to spend time in the hotel. We found the two internet access PC's in the lobby very handy, and on only a couple of occasions did we have to wait. Breakfast was very good for a 'free' breakfast. They had the usual selection of cereal, fruit, yoghurts, pastries, muffins, etc, plus a small selection of cooked foods like sausages, bacon, egg, etc. Free coffee, juice and milk as well of course. The staff at the front desk were very friendly and polite. Both check-in and check-out were efficent. We didn't make use of the parking at the hotel, which at around $42 a day plus tip (it is valet only), we were glad we didn't have a car. The hotel does have an undercover pull in, which is big enough to hold a couple of cars, which was handy for us on checkout day as we collected a car from Avis just around the corner, and brought it back to the hotel to load up. They were happy for us to park in the drop-off area for 15 minutes to load up. We'd have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to others, and would certainly stay there again.

So many attractions nearby in the wharf but also Pier 39 and it's seals and shops.

As a Priority Club member, i have stayed in several 5-stars Intercontinental, Crowne Plaza and 4-stars Holiday Inn during my business and leisure trips thoughout Asia. This hotel is the first HI-Express i am staying in (not many HI-Express franchises in Asia), but since i am on a vacation and paying my own hotel bills, i don't mind and had no expectations whatsoever. I booked on the basis of the photos posted on the hote's website. When i arrived, i was pleasantly surprised by the clean and well kept condition of the place. It looks new and very well maintained, from the lobby to the elevators and to the rooms. Requested for a Alcatraz facing room and request was met. Great ! The room is fairly alright for 2 persons, and very typical of the Holiday Inns i have stayed throughout Asia. The shower/toilet was cleaned. The room provides free wired internet and Playstation console. I guess the concept of HI-Express is minimal service and facilities. So that way, they keep cost down and room rates affordable. I paid about US$90 per night and i would say its a great deal considering the clean and well maintained room, the free self serve continental breakfast and the free internet. If what u need is a good room and safe hotel to sleep in, this is it. If you like to lounge around the hotel in the day, require a swimming pool. fitness centre or a bar in the evening, try the Hyatt across the road or Sheraton around the corner. My wife and I were there for a vacation, so we returned to the room past 10pm and out the next day by 10am. So we are happy with the price and quality. Good location too. The last stop of the tram is a short walk away, and so is the pier where u can see the crab stalls. The free train ride to Union Sq is also just round the corner, and getting to ferry terminal to Alcatraz is a 8 minutes pleasant walk. Lots of food options around, from burgers to cafes.

If you're looking for a hotel with lots of history and character, don't come here. However, if all you need is a comfortable bed, a quiet room, a safe location and friendly service it's perfect. Previous reviews had also mentioned asking for a room facing the courtyard to minimise noise - I included this when making my internet booking, and our wish was granted, with our room also being on the top floor. Our flight from Australia was scheduled to arrive around 10.30am, but a quick call to the hotel a couple of days before confirmed they had a luggage room if we needed to kill a couple of hours before check-in. Imagine our surprise and pleasure when, on arriving at the hotel around midday, we were given our room straight away. The hotel has a free business centre near reception, with two PCs with internet access, plus a printer. There's also a breakfast area on the ground floor, with a free continental breakfast included in the price. It's not exactly gourmet, and our first experience there was a little overwhelming as a large school group were staying - enough said! However, the Hollywood Cafe a couple of doors down did a great lunchtime BLT, so I'd imagine their breakfast was pretty good too. There's a pretty good sports bar/restaurant right across the street, plus there's also a Safeway and a Walgreens a block or so east on North Point. We found the staff unfailingly helpful and friendly, the bed was very comfortable, and the room EXTREMELY quiet. The hotel's just far enough away from the main action at Fisherman's Wharf to be quiet, but is just a five minute walk away.Once we checked out, Pier 35 was an easy walk of 5 blocks, towing our bags along.

Stayed for four nights in room 483 and 485 (the fourth floor is the top floor so this is not a huge place). There was no view as you are sandwiched in between hotels and other buildings but we didn't come to sit in the room. We paid $62/night through hotwire.com on a rather last-minute trip and this was an extraordinary value for this normally $200+ night hotel. The hotel looks like it is brand new!! It is probably the cleanest, best maintained hotel we've stayed in and we've stayed in a lot, including upscale five star establishments! The furniture, furnishings, linens, beds ... everything ... top notch and in perfect working and very comfortable condition. The staff, including the maids, are all very friendly and helpful. The new hot breakfast is very good and saves a ton of $ on breakfast every morning. The only complaint - well, a couple complaints, is it isn't very hot. The hot items are lukewarm at best and the variety is the same every day. Some pancakes or waffles would be a nice touch as not everyone enjoys biscuits and gravy (a daily offering). The other complaint that really doesn't have as much to do with the hotel is the other guests - every morning we had pushy, rude people crowding in trying to cut in line, like a bunch of pigs waiting for food at the trough. The thing the hotel could do to mitigate this is re-think the way the breakfast is set up. Logistically it could be set up in a better way to avoid people crowding in. It is fantastic that they provide a hot breakfast, it is good and the gentlemen manning the breakfast ensure there is never anything empty, they do a very nice job. A nice touch are the two free computers they provide in the lobby for internet use. They are even hooked up to printers which was great to be able to print out city maps etc. They do get busy though and the waiting line can be long. The hotel location is perfect and so close to everything you'd want to do. We didn't have a car to worry about the exorbanant parking charges; we took the 'Go Lorries' airport shuttle both to/from the airport which worked out wonderfully. We walked everywhere or used the 3-day MUNI passes we purchased for $18 to ride the cable cars, streetcars and bus system all over SF. The passes were well worth the money.

After our first night we found that we could park on the road on a meter from 7pm to 7am for free outside the front of the hotel and then moved the car into a $10 car park for the day. We later found that further along North Point there is free road parking day and night in some parts so its worth looking for, but be carefull to check the road signs each time you park as the roads are cleaned between 2am and 6am on alternate days of the week.

We were pleased with the solid construction - never heard neighbor noise or traffic noise (we had courtyard rooms.) The breakfast bar was fully stocked for a large crowd and they kept it full for the entire morning. The room was updated and stocked with all the right things, the beds were comfortable and the fiber-filled pillow selection was great. We only had 2 complaints: 1) no wireless in the rooms. They do have connections in the rooms, but it doesn't work easily for Mac users. The staff was very attentive in trying to help us make it work, but in the end, we just used 1 of the 2 computers near the lobby that they keep open for guest use, which is very helpful. 2) despite a reservation for 2 adjacent rooms made 6 months ago, the only thing they had available were two 1st floor streetside rooms (they admitted the rooms were noisy.). But they accommodated by putting us on the quieter 3rd floor. Though the rooms were far apart, they didn't question us when we had our teens stay alone in the 2nd room. (Many hotels have a problem with that.) The hotel is near some great restaurants (Joe's Crab Shack - great family friendly menu and view over fun goings on in the wharfside street) and Boudin (very good chowder - recommend the outdoor eatery - less hectic.) It's an easy walk to Ghiradelli & Cannery Row and a pleasant, do-able walk to Pier 39. Transportation advice: The hotel is near the 2 starting point terminals for cable cars, but if you go after 10 am, you're looking at a half hour wait (an hour on weekends.) However the historic street car (the F line) that travels down Embacadero isn't too crowded except during the 4:30 - 6pm rush hour. And that's only $1.50 per trip. That line can take you to the Ferry Building area, or to Union Square. From there you could walk up to ChinaTown. We wasted our money on the 3 day $18 municipal pass. The cable cars were too crowded to make use of, so we used the buses or the streetcars, which are significantly cheaper. Our family's favorite things - Alacatraz (get tix a day in advance or order from alcatrazcruises.com online), a Giants game and Pier 39 (sea lions, shops and Hard Rock Cafe). Due to the cold weather, we didn't rent bikes and ride through G G park or across the bridge.

The location is perfect as you can easily walk to everything..the cable cars, buses, and all the attractions. My suggestion is to purchase a \"Go San Francisco Card\" you pay one price about $75.00 for 3 days and it includes all the tourist attractions you can visit...museums, Palace of Fine Arts, Exploritorium, Aquarium, Wine Tours, Alcatraz, Boat Cruises, Cable Car Rides, bike rentals..and much more.

The bed was amazingly comfortable - if only we could have sneaked it home in our cases. the free breakfast was wonderful. especially considering it was free.

Like other people who wrote reviews, we were on the first floor and had to use the lift as the stairs were all marked as fire exits.

The room was very clean, very comfortable. We had one of the suites facing Northpoint St, across from the Hyatt. Surprisingly, it wasn't as noisy as we anticipated because there was very little traffic in the area. The breakfast buffet is included. Not bad (meaning, we've had worse). There were cinnamon rolls, scrambled eggs (looked like Egg Beaters), sausages, biscuits and gravy. There was a good assortment of cereals, bread (toaster!) and muffins. There were all kinds of beverages (low & fat-free milk, juices, coffee, tea) but strangely, no ice. We ate at the height of the breakfast hour (8am), so finding a table was a challenge.

We rode thru the Chinese area on the way. Many older ladies got on with their shopping bags and gossiped at breakneck speed. As we passed, I noticed the stores selling food were jammed. I felt transported to a crowded Asia. I quietly commented to my Asian wife that she will look right at home on this bus in a few years chatting with all the old ladies.. That comment was overheard by the lady sitting across from us who laughed out loud upon hearing it. We chatted with her and had some laughs. We had fun shopping in the stores. Macy's has 7 floors on each side of the street, 7 for men, 7 for women. That was pretty cool.. I bought my wife a nice gift. A reasonable $10 fare to take us taxi back to the hotel.. We rested, then strolled some more, all jacketed and ready for the cold San Francisco nights. We slept well that night and came home safely. The hotel served it's purpose more than adequately. The location, the full continental breakfast, and the cleanliness of the room stand out in my mind. The beds were sturdy and comfortable.. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only negative is those damn parking fees in SF, $35 a night plus tax. We could have saved about 7-10 dollars a night by parking off site and walking but it wasn't really worth it to me. But the Hotwire mostly deal offset it.. I know now that Holiday Inn Express can deliver comfort and convenience to the traveler and tourist. Without equivocation, I can tell you it's as good or better than the 4 star hotels we've visited.", "Date": "December 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cExceeded expectations\u201d", "Author": "Lvv2trvl", "ReviewID": "UR11608016", "Content": "Stayed here as last resort using points and I was impressed.

Seemed to have a good location, competitive price, and is fairly new. I found the best deal by pre-paying directly on the hotel website and even chose a mini-suite as it would be myself, my wife, and my two young boys so I wanted a little extra room. So, check-in went fine and the valet parking was great. $35 + tax per day with in/out priviliges. The hotel is decorated well and is very clean. The hallways are very wide and, overall, the 'feel' is very appealing. Once we found our room (4th floor overlooking the wharf) I was a bit disappointed. The mini-suite means that there is a fold-out couch sitting in the window area and an area is setup with sink, mini-fridge, microwave. I do admit that the kitchenette area was good to have, but the room itself was not much larger than a normal room. I was expecting a bit more I guess - oh well. Once we unpacked I noticed that the walls were VERY thin. I could hear the TV from the room next to us, water running from what seemed to be every bathroom, and the noise from people in the hall was overwhelming. This was a huge turn-off for us. I realize that you get noise when you are in a hotel but this was a bit extreme. The next morning we went down for the Continental Breakfast. This is definitely nice to have, although the quality of the food was not that great. You cannot expect too much for a Continental Breakfast so take these comments as just that, comments. Check-out went smoothly, we were able to extend our check-out until 2pm, which was good as we were tired and didn't need to leave for the airport until 2:00. All-in-all, this is a Holiday Inn - which seems, to me, to have gone downhill in recent years.

You do not need to rent a car because you have all the transportation around you needed at all times of the day and night. We also took numerous tours which picked us up in front of the hotel. If you decide to rent a car the rate per night at the hotel w/tax is approx. $42.00. The Holiday Inn Express is very clean and unusually large and soundproof. The beds should be upgraded because they have seen many years of abuse. We used our points and did not have to pay anything and were put in a mini suite which included a fridge and microwave. The view was of the Wharf from our room but being we were on the run the entire week it was a pleasure to come back and leave from that location. The breakfast could be better and maybe more of it being you have a lot of people from other countries who took advantage of filling bags for dessert - I blame this on all of San Francisco who charge ridiculous prices for all food especially breakfast. I was told Denny's around the corner charged for 3 people an average of $72.00. New York is much cheaper than this City. Also, the homeless are out of control every place you walk in the best of areas they are begging, trying to touch you and sleeping in the streets. In fact they are out of control and make it very uncomfortable because no police and very little security around. They are even outside of the hotels but I felt fine because I had my husband and 15 year old son with me. If I was alone it would not be enjoyable. When you stand on the line for the Trolley Cars they are grabbing on to you and begging. Every park, every landmark, every place there are tons and tons of them even sleeping on the Trolly's before they roll out in the AM. I was interested in taking one of the Trolley's and stepped on the bus because I thought one of them worked for the transit and almost got cornered by 4 of them until my husband came behind me. This City is NOT SAFE for single women. I think they need to stop protecting them and clean up San Francisco because it is a beautiful place to visit. Everyone we met felt the same way in fact one women from England went to the baseball Giant Game the same night we attended and 3 of these homeless men sat next to them and every time they moved the homeless followed them until one fell and split open his chin and was bleeding but refused help and paramedics left the scene. I called them bums and almost got my head chopped off by many of the tour guides that we took trips with. One place we stopped to take a picture I walked with my son ahead of my husband and he felt someone right behind him when he picked up the bag that we were carrying and thought it was me but instead had a homeless right in his face.

All hotels seemed the same standard in the area, there were the more exclusive hotels in the City Centre (Hilton, Mark Hopkins, Francis Drake, Marriott etc) but for what we needed it was perfect. San Francisco is a fab city and Alcatraz is a must but be sure to book in advance. We also found the all day cable car pass $11 each to be very worth while. Shopping is a must here and you can pick up some fantastic bargains, whatever you are into!! - the only disappointing thing was the GG park did not seem to be too accesible, and we were curious as to how as this seems to be quite a large area to visit, we hired some bikes and cycled to the GG bridge, very good value for money and lock and helmet supplied which meant you could have lunch, or have a look round the souvenir shops.

But within that disappointing aspect of the neighborhood, we found the Holiday Inn Express a wonderful place to come home to. The hotel seemed quite new and sort of boutique-like in its decor.

The rooms were smallish, and probably not large enough for 4 people, and our room was probably one of many without any view whatsoever. Thankfully we chose this hotel for easy access to the cable cars and other things on our \"to do\" list. Valet parking was $32.00 per day (before taxes). I felt our car was fairly secure in that lot, however the hotel elevator takes anyone down to the parking area unsupervised.

With all this in mind me and my girlfriend were satisfied with our stay, not jumping for joy but happy. The location is great for the Wharf. There are around a dozen large hotel-chain properties all situated within an area of a few blocks so whether you stay at the HI Express, Sheraton, Hyatt, etc etc you'll more or less be staying in the same area. The main drawback is that the location is two blocks back from the Wharf area and the immediate vicinity isn't exactly a pleasant one. Pier 39 is a great place for a stroll, grab a meal and browse the shops. The area around the Cannery, Ghiradelli Square & the Cable-Car turnaround is also nice. It's the few blocks in between these areas however that make the Wharf un-savoury. A concentration of very tacky souvenir stores and one-too-many colourful characters spoil the area although we still felt happy that we'd chose the Wharf as our base. We were originally planning a stay at the Westin on Union Square and whilst we saw that the hotel itself was very grand we weren't convinced that staying smack-bang in the centre of the city would have been a better option. Every one of the 4 days we spent in the city involved starting things off within ten minutes of our hotel - whether it be Alcatraz, a superb city tour or cycling over the GG Bridge. The major gripe we had with the area was how early everything closed on Pier 39. We expected to be able to browse the shops, etc after dinner each night but from 10pm onwards the whole area closes up and you're left with the choice of having a drink in one of the few restaurant bars or returning to your hotel. The hotel itself is very modern and spotlessly clean. Certainly no character and most of the rooms face into central courtyards but if it's a new hotel with good standards that you look for this hotel is ideal. The rooms weren't large but fine, especially for a city hotel and the shower, room temperature, furniture etc were all great, as was the buffet breakfast included in the price. All-in-all our 4 days in San Francisco were brilliant, taking in some memorable experiences. If you want a very clean, modern hotel and can get a good rate at the Holiday Inn Express I'd recommend staying here and using it as a base. NB - Some people mix up the adjacent Holiday Inn with the Express - the normal HI is a lot older and I'd definitely opt for the Express over it.

I reported it to the hotel but nothing was ever done about it. I just called housekeeping for more blankets. Oh, I didn't like not having bars of soap. The front desk says you are supposed to wash you hands with the gel labeled scrub. All the other Holiday Inn Express' we have stayed at had bars of soap, but anyhow maybe just a small issue. The free breakfast in the morning was a big plus in the rate, except I've seen better selections at other Holiday Inn Express'we have stayed at. I didn't like the big bins of cereal. They had these scoops inside and people put their hands inside to scoop the cereal out. I thought that was unsanitary so we skipped the cereal.

The room was wonderful and quiet even though we had a room overlooking a street and a parking lot. The location is great being near the Wharf, plus near the cable cars and several buses. The biggest downside was the breakfast bar was packed to capacity every morning, probably because there were 170 kids in two groups on Spring Break trips. That meant we had often had to watch like hawks to get a table and many people didn't have a clue about how to clean up after themselves. However, the breakfasts were great with doughnuts, hard-boiled eggs, fresh fruit, hot cinnamon buns, cereal, and toast/English muffins. There also isn't a laundry facility onsite so we had to go next door to the Holiday Inn (not HI Express). That was awful since the room was dirty, one elevator was broken and they were out of laundry detergent.

There is no bar, porter or room service so you wil have to cope with your own luggage and to book trips you have to go to the bigger \"sister\" hotel up the street. These are minor niggles.
