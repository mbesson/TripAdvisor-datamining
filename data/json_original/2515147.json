The room is very visually appealing, clean, relatively spacious for a Paris hotel, and the bathrobe was very comfy and plush. The location can't be beat as it's central and very close to the metro. It should have been an top notch stay, but the promise of wonderful never quite materialized. I felt unwelcome in the first two minutes at the front desk. Ten guests who came in after I did had no trouble accessing their rooms at 11:30am, but somehow my room was not available and wouldn't be until 2pm. When I did get my room hours later, it was sauna-hot despite the air conditioner being on the lowest setting an the outside temp being a cool 58 degrees. The best solution the front desk had was asking if I'd tried taking off my coat and providing a noisy table fan and a suggestion to turn off the a/c and crack open a window. When I dared look less than pleased with this MacGyver-esque solution, the clerk's reply was a shrug and a \"mademoiselle is only staying one night.\" Well if mademoiselle had been staying longer than one night, mademoiselle would have turned into fire-breathing American tourist used to getting a modicum of service for a room booked directly thru the hotel when it would have been slightly cheaper to book through a service like Hotels.com. The location thing turned out to be a double edged sword. Yes, it was central, but it was very noisy too, and sleeping with an open window felt like I'd bed down in cot on the sidewalk to be rocked to sleep by the nonstop traffic, the ambulances, the honking, the motorcycles, and the general pedestrian traffic of a centrally located Paris hotel.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cCozy for two\u201d", "Author": "WeatherOrKnot", "ReviewID": "UR126932884", "Content": "Charming hotel with an excellent location.

The hotel has a bar that (according to the literature) is open from 12am until midnight during the week... but at 10.20pm, it was impossible for me to buy a pint. The place was locked up tight, and the receptionist just told me \"It is closed...

A 4 minute walk takes you to the Pereire metro (Line 3) and Pereire-Levallois (Line C) RER stations. The area around the hotel is quiet, but not dead. There are shops, restaurants and bars all nearby - a great place to relax after a good long walk around the city during the day.

We flew into Orly and it took about 20-30 minutes in a taxi to reach the hotel. The perriere area where the hotel is located is nice and chic and so much quieter than the opera areas etc and the champs elysees! After hours spent on foot battling through the crowds it was a bit of a blessing to come back to Perriere and the quiet hotel! We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a junior suite which was a great size considering hotel rooms are always notoriously small in Paris. Bed was huge (two twins pushed together) and quite comfy. Beyond expensive mini bar (standard) and nice views of the parisian street below. Only criticism of the room would be the tiles in the bathroom - which was basically a wet room with bath AND a huge shower (rarity) but they seemed to be slightly unstable and in desperate need of resealing/regrouting! The l'occtaine products were a lovely touch though, as were the macaroons in a hotel ampere box! Staff all seemed very friendly and gave us maps etc which we constantly used throughout our stay. We went to Disneyland for the day and used the train which took about 40 minutes on the RAR - would definitely recommend this! The hotel also offered us the chance to prebook tickets there but we had booked them before we got to Paris. The main sights are about a 20 minute - 30 minute walk away, depending on your pace - staff will give you directions and its a really pleasant walk down a pretty much straight road!

It was in a wonderful location in the 17 arrondissement, which is very chic, and it was very near both a metro and RER station.( I mean, a one minute walk). The breakfast is expensive, but we didn't try it, and the award-winning restaurant was closed for August, which is to be expected. There was a Monoprix around the corner, where we bought breakfast. The staff are multilingual,although some of them speak better English than others. (I spoke French the whole time, so this is based on the conversations I heard at the desk). There is a smell of what I think is vanilla orchids throughout the hotel. It's strong in reception, where there are a lot of orchids, and seems to be very slightly piped through the air con, (which is very good and also very quiet). There is a different, musty smell on the first floor corridor, but the carpet there is scrupulously clean. (Cleaning a carpet can actually release smells: it needs to be shampooed until the smell has gone). This is the only reason I'm not giving a rating of excellent. I feel it might be unsuitable for anyone with asthma. I did hear the receptionist talking about hypoallergenic rooms, so maybe they don't pipe the flower smell into the other building. (There are two buildings, the Villiers and the Ampere). The beds are very comfortable, but the huge double is actually 2 singles shoved together with a sheet spread over them to make one huge bed. This is common practice in France, but might be annoying for honeymooners. You can ask for a 'lit matrimonial' if you want an ordinary double, but I'm not sure how many they have. The room, a 'classique', was reasonably spacious, (very big by Parisian standards) and the shower was out of this world. Adjustable massage shower head, speaker in the bathroom, and, best of all, L'occitane toiletries, which left me with super soft skin. One thing I hate is unadjustable temperatures, as I like an ice cold rinse to close my pores. (I feel cold otherwise when I go out). This was perfectly adjustable. A caveat: the glass panel needs to be aligned with the edge of the bath, and even then, there is a fair amount of leakage onto the floor, but they are very generous with towels. (If you are a tiny, French-sized person, that may not happen). The best thing of all was the electronic blackout blind, which leaves you in total darkness, thus assuring a very good night's sleep. ( I am, I should point out, the lightest sleeper ever). My one quibble, and it is a small one, is that the receptionist couldn't post my postcards for me because they weren't stamped. I found it extraordinary that a) he didn't know how much a postcard cost to post abroad and b) that he couldn't take it off my credit card afterwards. That said, French newsagents sell stamps (timbres), so I bought the stamps at the airport and posted them there. Perhaps that's the normal practice. They were happy to print out our boarding passes at reception, and they called a taxi for us, which arrived promptly.

The bed was comfortable, the pillows were great. Only issue was broken A/C (only in our room) - this wasn't fixed during our stay but they provided us with a desk fan and offered us free drinks at the bar and free breakfast for the duration of our stay. Which is fantastic customer service! As for the bar, restaurant etc. it is very expensive - 5\u20ac for a lemonade! Breakfast is 17\u20ac per person per night (for us 51\u20ac a day!) - it is very expensive but I loved it! A great selection of pastries, bread, fruit, yohgurts, eggs, bacon, sausage. A buffet style with a relaxed yet formal feel. It is rarely busy and generally quite quiet. With patio garden tables as well as indoor tables, you get a choice. The staff are all very friendly, and they didn't hesitate in helping us asking for directions, ordering a taxi for us, sorting out any issues we had. Even as you passed them in a corridor you always got a \"bonjour\" and a smile - which makes the difference. I think, though, one of the best things about it is that it is not touristy - it is real Paris. It is very easy to get to the tourist sights, though. The RER will take you to the Eiffel Tower, Les Hotel de Invalides, Notre Dame and the metro will get you everywhere else! The French Metro system is very efficient but take a few moments to get your bearings with it as you do need to make 3 or 4 changes if you want to go somewhere. When it comes to transport, I recommend getting a carnet - which is 10 journeys for 12\u20ac and you can purchase anywhere. Sometimes the Metro stations are not staffed, use the self service! It is very simple and you can work your way around it with very little French. If you want to site-see then I recommend the L'Open Tour (The Yellow Buses).

He walked over to speak with the front desk personally since it was not likely that my parents ages 85 and 89 would be out after flying from the west coast. Again, he was told that they were not in their room. He spent the better part of the day worrying only to find out that they were, in fact, in the room. The air conditioning in the room did not work and was never fixed in spite of several requests to do so. The attitude of those at the front desk were inexcussable for any business be it McDonalds or a 4 star hotel. The last straw was the day we departed. We were being picked up by the barge crew at our respective hotels (a block away from each other). We walk over a few minutes early expecting to find my parents waiting in the lobby. When they were not there (the lobby is small) we asked the person behind the desk to call the room and we were told that they had checked out. When we asked them to call anyway they said no one was in the room and would not call. We found out a few minutes later that, not only were they in the room waiting, but when my parents called down to have their luggage brought down the phone was not answered. They brought their own luggage down. When complaining to the desk that they were not able to get through, the response was \"I was on the phone\"....no joke, this is completely true. The front desk personnel were the rudest, most incompetent and arrogant that any of us had experienced. We have all travelled the globe for many years and this is by far the worst. In today's economy one would think that every effort be made to show appreciation for making the choices we do. I would strongly recommend that if you are considering staying here, you take your hard earned money elsewhere.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, GA", "Title": "\u201cFirst time in Paris--great hotel\u201d", "Author": "rayc441", "ReviewID": "UR113125175", "Content": "Stayed here for 3 days in June 2011.

The Ampere had been my 1st choice due to the rooms on offer & the value for money received. On this visit I have to say my love affair has come to an end. The hotel went under new management last year I think and just does not provide the same value for money and the rooms are starting to look Jaded. One of the previous benefits of booking the Ampere was the buffet style breakfast that had been included in the price. This was not only a nice touch but also a convenient way to start the day before going out to explore wonderful Paris. This time round the hotel was expecting us to pay 18 euros each for this and although nice it is certainly not worth this. The rooms are now in need of renovation and starting to look very outdated with their early 1990's heavy bed covers. I have stayed in the Ampere happily for many years but just began to feel that this year the hotel management are starting to take their customers for granted. The room air conditioning was bearly noticeable and the carpets looked stained and tired, the wooden desktops in need of varnishing. Put simply the rooms are not horrendous but they are certainly not in keeping with a modern 4 star hotel. Don't open the minbar unless you want to pay 6 euros for a coke (Yes Hotel Minibars are expensive but this is just excessive) and dont expect to pay less than 9 euros for the smallest glass of wine I have seen in a long time.

It was the only seat in the sunshine, but two staff members insisted that we move to another seat which was about 15 feet away but in the shade, apparently it was the outdoor seat seat for the bar.

Facilities: We booked well in advance and provided our contact details yet the hotel failed to inform us before arriving that they had the plumbers in and there was no water from noon to evening the whole time we were there . They didn't think to perhaps offer a couple of bottles of water in the room that might have been used for washing hands and faces or even to drink. They'd also torn out the bar near the lobby for renovations but hadn't set up any alternative facilities. I'll never get used to the fact that most European hotels seemed to have dispensed with any sort of welcome for their guests. Many don't even have doormen or bell staff and you're expected to fend for yourself hauling bags out of the taxi and up to your room etc. This place was no exception. Reception and Room Check in was fairly painless (for us, another pair of guests seemed to be quite worked up about something) and we went up to our room which was non-smoking with a garden view as requested. Don't bother though, its not worth the premium. Room size was about 18 - 20 sq meters which is quite nice for Paris. The bathroom however was tiny, and due to the water problem, the toilet would not flush for half the day. The paint on the walls was peeling in places and the bedspread and carpet had definitely seen better days. There were traces of mold at the edges of the window and in the bathroom. The desk and other furniture were of cheap materials and were chipped and scuffed. They also use those cheap refillable bottles for their generic toiletries so remember to bring your own. There were no dressing gowns or slippers and when we asked at reception they snootily informed us these were not provided in our room category. However they did deign to send some up about an hour later so my hunch is they just don't have enough to go around or are saving on laundry bills. Incidentally, the reception closes at night (there is an on duty clerk who hides in his office) and you have to swipe your keycard at the door to let yourself in to a darkened lobby after 11. Breakfast: Our price included it so we dutifully went down to find a selection and presentation that was modest and bland. They clearly don't think its a meal their guests should enjoy as much as just fuel-up on before pushing off for the day. The restaurant was clean and well lit though. The highlight of the stay however was when we came back from wandering in the city to find a pack of half-eaten mixed nuts and a bottle of half-empty mineral water on the table. It seems someone from house keeping had decided to have their break in our room and helped themselves to the mini-bar? My girlfriend was quite put-off by this and I must say I didn't hide my feelings either when speaking to the manager. He promised in true Clouseau fashion to \"launch an investigation\" and offered us a complimentary bottle of wine - a mini bottle and not a full one! Language: They do speak English but retreat into pretending not to understand when you have any questions or complaints. Luckily we're both fluent in French so when they threw up their shoulders in the famous gallic shrug and pretended not to understand, we switched to that language just to be helpful. It may have caused some dismay behind the counter. Summary: If we hadn't booked, paid for and expected a 4 star we would have been less disappointed. The hotel clearly over-sells itself and then fails to deliver. Or perhaps we just have high standards being used to the amazing hospitality you get all over Asia and the Far East. To be fair a couple of the reception staff were quite friendly, the rooms weren't smelly and all the switches and things worked. But the incident of finding someone had picnicked in our room (and god knows what else) really put us off.

The desk staff were very helpful and seemed happy to make dinner reservations on our behalf at a restaurant we chose. We easily found a taxi in the morning to take us to CDG for our trip back to the States. If we hadn't found one on the street, we would have easily walked to the Place Pereire taxi stand.

We had two interconnecting double rooms on the fourth floor overlooking the inner garden. Honestly, there is nothing bad I can think about this hotel. It is perfect in every respect. The location was ideal, a little away from the maddening crowd but conveniently placed right next to the Periere metro stop and Periere Levallois stop on the C train. Getting to the hotel from Eurostar station (Gare du Nord) was a little difficult with bags due to the metro connections but manageable nonetheless. On our way back we took the taxi, hardly \u20ac15. Check in was a breeze. I had booked the rooms through octopustravel.com at a very reasonable rate for four nights. The reception desk had everything ready when we reached there at around 4pm. Rooms were of decent size according to European standards and all the closets were nicely tucked away in corners, a smart use of space. Bathrooms were clean, no L\u2019occitane products in our room but the ones we had were of good quality too. Rooms and bathrooms were cleaned every single day. Breakfast is included in their room rate. The first day we had it delivered to our room, it came with coffee/tea, orange juice and a good selection of pastries, but no hot items. The rest of the days we ate in their restaurant, the fare was decent, pastries, scrambled eggs, cheese, fruits etc. It did get very crowded one day as it was raining and there was less seating inside the restaurant but the staff still managed to make everyone sit and replenish the food items quickly. Never ate dinner at the hotel as there is plenty of good quality and reasonably priced places around. We ate at the Lebanese place Phoenicia across the street one day then at New Sana (Indian) and Lotus de Thai on other days. Everywhere we ate the food and service was of good quality. There is a Monoprix supermarket a few streets from Av de Villiers for getting water and snacks. Hotel staff is very nice and friendly. They all speak English and are ready to help. Internet is not free; if you bring a laptop then you can buy hours and use them as you go along. We bought 10 hours for \u20ac30 and used them over four days.

The bathroom was fantastic, no complaints there. Our problem was with the staff. We had a fight over staff with breakfast, they were rude and ignorant and as we didnt have good French that made it hard, they were very reluctant to help you undertsand what they were trying to convey, we got the impression that it was very inconvienent of us to not speak French! We had prepaid for our breakfast and it was delivered to our room, however on one particular morning the phone wasnt working and we had to go down to request it (we figured this out ourselves!) The member of staff brought up the breakfast (which was sizeably smaller than the previous days breakfast) and only brought 2 and not the requested 3. When I pointed this out he said he would come right back with a third, he came back with a cup and a yoghurt and handed them to me and told me tough luck this was all I was getting! Also the restaurant was closed and there was no room service, not something I expected for the money I paid for the rooms. The bar was also ridiculously expensive, we expected it to be dear alright but this was just insane.

I stayed here with my wife and 11 year old daughter for 4 days in a superior triple room on the 4th floor overlooking the road. Overall I would say it is pretty good at just about everything, but not excellent at anything, nor poor at anything. In a city full of hotels that have at least some drawbacks that makes The Ampere stand out. The location is good because it is next to the Metro and RER for easy access to everywhere. Also, I did feel safe at night walking around the neighbourhood, which is relatively quiet. Many reporters have commented on the Bistro next door, which is very good - make sure you book your table the day before. The room was just about large enough, the beds were comfortable (and I'm not a great sleeper in hotels generally) and everthing was clean. The bathroom was re-stocked with Loccitane products daily, although the bath was tiny. The shower was the preferred option, and the toilet was in its own room. The window had a motorised blackout shutter, which was extremely effective at eliminating all noise and light. You will need to use an alarm to wake you up because it could be 11am and it will still appear to be completely dark. All the hotel excpet one floor of bedrooms is non-smoking. The breakfast room is typically busy, with overspill into the courtyard (if dry) and the bar area. Once again, the breakfast is good but not great - a self service buffet of decent variety. The buffet quickly runs out of everything and the replenishment is not always that fast, so if you see something you fancy it's a case of grabbing it there and then or maybe waiting a while. The service at the front desk is very good - if you ask for help I cannot imagine that you would be left wanting. Nothing is too much trouble and their English is excellent. We didn't use the bar in the evnings, so can't comment on that. It's easy travelling from CDG and Orly airports - head for the RER Pereire Levallois (on the C1 line towards Pontoise) and the hotel is just around the corner. From CDG take the RER to St Michel Notre Dame, then take the C1 RER towards Pontoise. It's as simple as that and you even get a view of the Eiffel Tower along the way.

It was easier to have a bath and use the shower head to do your hair while sitting, I dont know if other rooms had proper showers or if this is the case in every room. Otherwise the hotel was spotless breakfast was served upto 10am in the dining room or 11 in your bedroom and the staff were more than helpfull. Periere was the nearest Metro station and we had no problem getting around. As other reviews have stated it is quite expensive to have soft drinks or water in the hotel but the supermarket is on the next street and just a couple of minutes walk you can buy a 6 pack of coke for 2.25 euro and a small bottle of water for 35cent. A lot of resturants do good deals on a 3 course set menu with a bottle of wine or try the Latin quarter we had a lovely 3 course meal for 15 euro each and ask for the house wine your in France and its good. Just one other word of warning we used Paris shuttle (not the airport shuttle service) to collet us from the airport as this was a cheaper way to travel from Beauvis airport directly to our hotel by shaing a cab but we were brought to Euro Disney first this added another 96klm to an already 78klm journey then on our return journey to the Airport the driver was an hour late collecting us and we thought we would miss our flight and check in time.

We stayed in a Superior (roadside) Room - Hotel web site price -280euros, we paid 125euros with a hotel booking website. We didn't ask to be upgraded or moved to a room with a garden view as we only used the hotel to sleep in. On Sunday morning we had breakfast in a restaurant by the Rodin Museum, and on Monday morning we caught the 07:15 Eurostar train back to Waterloo. Arriving on the 16th around 22:00, we checked in. The front-of house staff were amenable and courteous. Before leaving London on the Saturday morning, we tried to book the Jules Verne restaurant (Eiffel Tower) for dinner on our anniversary on the Sunday night, but they told us they were fully booked. At check-in we asked one of the hotel staff if they would call the restaurant and try and get us a table (I wish I had taken his name now). No problem - what time!!!! Let that be a lesson - if the staff at the restaurant do not like your accent wait until you get to France and ask the concierge to try! The Superior Room was a good size. The WC and Bathroom were separate. The Bathroom comprised a separate bath and shower. We had an iron and ironing board and plenty of wardrobe space. There was a safe in the wardrobe. Although we had a roadside room we did not notice any traffic noise (maybe because we stayed at a weekend). From previous reviews, we walked down to the Place du Mal Juin (big roundabout with at least a dozen restaurants situated on it, and the nearest Metro station), which was only 100m. Again, from previous reviews, we asked for a table at Le Bistro Du 17eme. They were happy to take us at 22:50, even though the restaurant closed at 23:30. We had the fixed menu 33euros per person (three courses which included a bottle of wine). We left the restaurant just after midnight and never felt we were being rushed. The food was good. The restaurant was packed (possibly because it was a Saturday night?). Recommendation for the Jules Verne restaurant - * Michelin Star chef, Alain Reix Fantastic setting and amazing food. We had the 'Menu of Discovery', which comprised 7 courses and cost 128euros per person (everyone at the table has to have this menu - one person cannot have it and the other(s) order from the a la carte menu). It must be ordered before 21:30. Examples from the menu included - First course: 'Superposition of baby leeks, eels lightly smoked and duck liver, and green tomato chutney; one of the desserts: 'Pure caribbean chocolate jelly and avocado emulsion.\"", "Date": "September 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201c6 wonderful days in paris\u201d", "Author": "tomatorah", "ReviewID": "UR5765556", "Content": "Clean room and hotel (corridors smelt good!), staff friendly and helpful allowing us to use hotel phone when we had to make a phone call to england. Area is good with lots of restaurants around, but for those looking for a bar around Pereire (hard work) head out to St Germain Des Pres. Room average size but always clean and comfortable. Breakfast came as part of the lastminute deal and was the usual affair of croissants etc and was just fine for me to stock up before a days sightseeing. If you get the chance head out to St Germain and fidn the restaurant La Petula, for a good meal. Although there are lots of good restaurants around the area it is worth exploring. p.s find the patisserie opposite hotel mercedes-brilliant! :)", "Date": "September 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "chester uk", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel but even better restaraunt next door\u201d", "Author": "michaelgould", "ReviewID": "UR5703565", "Content": "This is a great hotel in a safe and pleasant area.

You are in the heart of Paris but the quietness makes you wonder whether you are far away. The front office staff is very helpful, courteous and friendly. The rooms are neat and have good bathrooms. The only negative aspect was the poor breakfast service.The restaurant in charge and staff needed to be pushed if one wanted proper service. They never replenished cutlery nor food in time which meant one had to wait for things to happen a reason which the restaurant in charge stated was due to the kitchen being refurbished. A bit of courtesy like that of the front office would have helped largely. On ewould therefore advise guests to go for breakfast early rather than stroll in late for one may not get anything. Also be careful about using the mini fridge in the room.Suggest you go down to Monoprix market in the next lane and get your drinks ,chocolates etc.", "Date": "August 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ash Vale, Surrey", "Title": "\u201cVery pleasant.\u201d", "Author": "Phil1957", "ReviewID": "UR5577197", "Content": "Just got back from 3 nights at the Ampere.

The rooms werent overly large, but the shower room was a good size and we had a lovely view over the garden. Breakfast had a reasonable choice included in our tariff, and we found the piano bar and garden to be a lovely spot to have a late night drink after hitting the sights of Paris. The area the hotel is in seemed to be an upmarket residential street, but you could walk to the Arc de Triomphe in about 15 minutes. Whilst the hotel isnt in the centre as such, the nearest Metro station is less than 100 yards away (Pereire) and you can quickly reach most areas by Metro. In addition, we flew with Ryanair to Beauvais and their bus terminates at Port Maillon is only about 15 minutes walk from the hotel One word of caution, the minibar in the room is automatic - soon as you remove the drink its charged to your account - and it costs 6 euros for a bottle of Kronenbourg. A tip would be to visit the \"Monoprix\" supermarket nearby - reception gave us directions, its only about 150 yards away, where you can buy 4 cans of Kronenbourg (bigger bottles with a higher alocohol content) for 2.60 euros and a bag of ice only costs 1.20 euros to cool them down. Another tip is that upon arrival we were told we would have a room overlooking the street, but for an additional 50 euros a night we could have one overlooking the garden, we declined the offer and got a garden room anyway. As for price we paid about \u00a385 a night thru lastminute and found it to be excellent value - published tariff by the hotel is 210 euros a night. Overall I would thoroughly recommend the Ampere, just avoid the minibar!!", "Date": "July 11, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ampere Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d251733-Reviews-Ampere_Hotel-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$171 - $337*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">102 Avenue de Villiers</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">17th Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75017</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515147", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c7/22/c722067f77cbd4034b24d078562256e56large.jpg"}}
