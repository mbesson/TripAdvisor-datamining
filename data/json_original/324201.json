It was too late to make a fuss and ask for more by the time we got home.

You have to go out and turn left to get to our hotel building. Our room was decent enough but the bathroom was terrible! It was very cramped! The toilet bowl was right in front of the tiny sink and you could literally wash your hands or brush your teeth while sitting on the toilet bowl. You will not fit inside the bathroom if you are on the heavy side. The sink was so tiny that it wasn't large enough to catch the falling water while you wash your face so the floor would get wet. The shower area was so small that the shower curtain would stick to you if you squatted on the floor to wash your privates. We dreaded using the bathroom and we couldn't wait to check out because of it. The only good thing about the bathroom was that it looked like it was newly renovated so the toilet bowl, sink, shower area were still new and had no grout or unsightly streaks. FYI, instead of providing you with towels they give white sheets which have the same texture as a table cloth / table napkin. It might seem weird but it actually does its job. I guess you would be ok with this hotel if you are not fussy/particular about the bathroom and you're very low maintenance. I would not recommend this hotel to my friends.

I'll admit, I was more concerned with other parts of my trip, so I wasn't paying much attention to Venice or the accommodations. So I was kind of surprised when I arrived to discover exactly how much I was paying for this place. (For the record: we paid ~200 Euros a night for a room for 3 people.) I have no problem paying... but I guess I'd like a little more luxe for that kind of money. Our room was through an alley in a back building - my New Yorker self did not like this at all, but as the doors to the restaurant kitchens were open and bustling, at least there were other people around. The building seemed to have been slightly renovated recently - newish fake hardwood floors, and newish Ikea like furniture (closets) in the rooms. The 3-person room came with a king sized bed, and a twin. There was another twin cot folded up as a footstool, with bedding in the closet. I'm honestly not sure how you could pull out the cot and still have room to walk around, though. Bathroom facilities were small but clean. Seemed impossible to take a shower without the shower curtain hugging you. We laughed at the towels at first (they're the material of my table cloths!), but they did get the job done. As many of the other reviews noted, if you want to be near the big attractions, can't beat this location. Next time, though, I'd be willing to stay a little off the beaten path. Oh, and note to people that like to over-pack: Venice is a walking city.

We had brought towels from home and used those for after our shower, and used towels for the bed as we were grossed out to even put our bodies and heads on the mattress. We were also told we would get 10% off dinner if we used the restaurant part of the hotel. We did go to the restaurant and did not get a 10% discount. The room we stayed at was in the back of a laneway facing a restaurant, there was a party about 20 feet away from our room, so needless to say we were up until the party ended at 3:30am (very loud, almost as if the party was in our room). Although there are many negative comments, the positive ting about this hotel is the location.

Breakfast is served in the restaurant below. All the bread is made fresh every morning. Watching it being made was fascinating, and the smell divine. Breakfast was a buffet that changed slightly every day though always included things like cereal, bread, toast, jam and spreads, hams and meats, sweat cakes and biscuits and fruit salads. You also help yourself to as much tea, coffee and fruit juice as you can drink. Overall I really couldn't fault this hotel. We had a wonderful stay.

No experience I've ever had comes close to my family and my experience at Hotel Rio over Easter. The Rooms we had were dirty; very noisy, hot and infested with bed bugs. The bathroom didn't possess towels in their place were table cloths as towel alternatives. The rooms needed a good clean. The staff were rude and unhelpful. None of us got any sleep. To cap it all they charged us E180 a night per room. A truly awful experience.
