Checked in on Tuesday and out on Saturday. Boy, was this a busy place!! Our group stayed in the Ocatilla Bldg, which a very nice. There was an upcharge for staying in the Ocatilla as you have access to the Ocatilla Lounge. This is similar to the Club Lounge at most Ritz-Carlton hotels but with much less in the way of food presentations, types and times a day. There was a small continental breakfast and then in the evening there were hot hourderves, wine and champagne. During the day you have access to basic beverages. The rooms appeared to be recently updated and were very spacious and tastefully decorated. I was on the first floor close to the elevators and I never heard anything outside of my room. I had no complaints other than a couple times with housekeeping. On one occassion it appeared the only thing that was done the bed being made and towels replaced. Trash and empty glasses remained. Then on the day before I was leaving housekeeping didn't get to my room to clean until 5:00 PM. I would much rather have the room attended to early in the day so that when I come back from time to time it's nice and neat. Other than that no complaints. The Ocatilla also has its own pool, which was wonderful. The main pool was very busy and rather crowded so it was nice to have this private pool that made it easy to sit by and read a book or even take a nap. Working with the staff there was a real pleasure. The person at the front desk at check-in didn't seem overly friendly and when one of our attendees needed 30 minutes extra at check-out she didn't really want to accomodate them but I was able to correct that. 30 minutes was an issue?? Really?? Anyway, beyond that everyone was great. Some might think the hotel is dated in the lobby and some of the meeting space but this is a Frank Lloyd Wright designed property and if you know anything about him you know this is his style and it's amazing! There was a lot going on while we were there and it felt a bit like they were understaffed. People were working multiple events at one time and we felt like that when our time was up in a particular area that we were rushed out the door. It's good that business is great but no one should feel they are any less important than the next group coming in. Maybe things are booked to tight. In any event, it all worked out fine. The shops that are on property are great. Most resorts have giftshops with prices that are out of reach for a lot of people. This isn't the case here. Even the actual hotel giftshop off the main lobby was very reasonable in their pricing. Very nice assortment of things to choose from. The thing to know about this property is that it is very spread out. I got a lot of walking in while I was there but since the food was so good that I probably ate more than I should...he walking was a good thing. After all is said and done, I'd go back tomorrow. And if I did, I'd stay in the Ocatilla.

Greetings by staff at the front entry were welcoming and helpful. Front of hotel is like vintage Hollywood Lobby dark, but beautiful southwest feel. Hotel staff friendly and attentive to details. Room was in older building, a distance from the front/main building. Old and not yet refurbished. Asked to be switched, but a large conference took new rooms. However, the balcony looked on to a beautiful landscaped garden and it was very spacious. Amenities in room were not \"Waldorf \" level, but fine. Room service was excellent for dinner and breakfast, on time, well prepared and served beautifully. Food in all of the restaurants was very good to excellent, service slightly slow at times, but staff always attentive and kind. Walk to pool and health club slightly confusing, but once there, terrific equipment and staff available. The most terrific feature of the hotel is the outside bar area and fire pits. Day or night it beckoned people to be able to sit out doors alone or with others, doing work, chatting or just simply enjoying the vista. It was terrific. I spent hours there. Reading, eating, working, socializing and just enjoying the ability to relax and look at the sky and the stars 24/7. Never left the ground (by choice) my entire visit. My disappointment was the older room, its distance to main areas and the building feeling tired.

We had a suite and although the room was very spacious, the decor and furniture looked like a Holiday Inn not a Waldorf Astoria hotel. What I mean is that the furniture was all very worn, inexpensive and too small for the large room. I will say the mattress was incredibly comfortable and we slept great. There are 8 pools at the resort so you can easily find one that is not very crowded and the cafe at the main pool is really great. The other restaurant options were alright but none were really worth raving about here. We had better meals when we left the resort. As for the gym and spa, all of the amenities are spread out in different buildings. The gym is in one building with the locker rook but the workout studio (where classes are held) was in a totally different building. The spa services are crammed into the gym facility and not luxurious or relaxing at all. The humidity level of the locker room was outrageous due to the steam room and hot tub. It was not fun to get ready in there and once again the facilities felt very old. They need to build a whole new gym and spa. Lastly, expect to pay extra for any classes such as yoga or Zumba. They also charge extra for their guided morning walk which seemed really absurd. The actual gym is very well equipped and I used it every day. For a great workout, be sure to hike Camelback Mountain in the morning. Awesome. In the end, I do recommend the resort since the grounds are exceptional and the staff was lovely. I just feel for the cost of the room and the prestige of the resort, it should have been more luxurious and comfortable.

This is a gorgeous place, well-manicured, excellent workers who kept the rooms picked up, beds made, bathroom top-shape and somehow doing this without being seen. But...here's the part that ruined our stay...we were put into a room on the edges of the property...which we liked because we enjoy the quiet...but my husband had to go to several seminars held on the property. My husband has medical problems that make it difficult to walk for long distances (and the Biltmore is quite spread out) plus it can get extremely hot in Phoenix. We were told to just call the numerous men at the front who would come pick him up in a golfcart and drop him off at the required meetings. At the end of our 5 nite stay, we received our bill. On the bill was included a rather hefty fee for \"parking\" (we didn't have a car). I called the parking/cart guys and asked the parking bell captain what that was about and he said basically said that since we didn't tip each time (it was getting expensive), they added this fee. I objected, felt insulted and he said he would take it off. This is a very expensive place to stay. And if you are not rich, you would probably stay there because you are going to a convention or business meetings. Having to pay tips for necessities such as a ride across a large area (on a very hot day), again and again, adds up. Also, it was simply insulting for a punitive fee such as what was added to our bill to have been done. The Biltmore makes too much money for it not to be paying their staff well...let alone, not paying anything to the guys who run around on the golfcarts and having to exist on tips (as the bell captain explained to me at the end).

The grounds are stunning, the history is palpable, the pools stunning and the additional activity offerings and onsite restaurants, spa and shops are wonderful. The rooms, unfortunately can't hold a candle to the exterior beauty of the resort. Last year when we stayed here we were in a deluxe room and found it to be dated,dark and drab. This year we decided to upgrade to a villa suite as we thought it may be more upscale. While the room itself was spacious, with a living room, full kitchen, walk in closet and large bath, once again we found scratched furniture, stained cushions on the chairs and the carpeting was worn with ground in traffic patterns. Our only other criticism is the \"reserving\" of pool chairs. While signage states that one should not reserve chairs, this is clearly not the case. Almost every morning I saw people out as early as 7:00am taking towels and items from their rooms and reserving up to 8 chairs at a time. When I checked back later in the day it seemed these chairs had not been used until late afternoon! This is much too high class a resort for this type of activity to go on. There is no life guard so no staff monitor the pool activity. Also sorely missing were any wait staff taking orders for drinks, etc. This resort is a Hilton property, but honestly I have stayed at much less expensive Hiltons and had more updated rooms.

First, the things that stood out, then the\"need to work ons\". Customer service was exemplary. It was a packed house when we checked in on Wed. Night and the lobby was sort of a madhouse. One small negative, the bellboy who took us to our room was not familiar enough with the property, and he couldn't find it without our help. No big deal, but then he asked if we wanted him to take our bags to the second floor, 3 ladies with big bags! Don't ask, just do! Anyway, the room was lovely, just not what I Had asked for when reserving. I made sure to ask if there would be plenty of room with a rollaway bed, and if we had stayed I this room we would have had to crawl over the bed to get to the bathroom. I'll make a long story short. The front desk staff was gracious under pressure, and the next morning our room was switched. From there on, it was all uphill.our every request was met on a timely basis, the grounds are stupendious, and every staff person was friendly. While the spa could use a moderization, it was clean, staffed and comfortable. Our treatments, while pricy were divine. A nice touch was the private whirlpool outside the spa for quiet relaxing. Frank and Albert restaurant was not inexpensive but not price gouging either. Small complaints. Spa needs a makeover. Need a few more staff around the pool in busy times, and it was packed every day. The policy on the pool gates state that there is no early morning saving of pool chairs, but clearly there is no one to enforce this, and not enough staff walking around seeing if guests would like anything. Also really needed staff at spa area to keep the kids, out, as the sign posted said it was adults only. We were disappointed that Wrights restaurant was not open every night. Last but not least, I and my friends wanted the biltmore to be more proactive in conservation ideas. This is the desert, and water at this resort is used copiously. There were the usual small signs about towels and bedding,but what about something asking that melted ice water or leftover water in bottles, etc. not be thrown down the drain. Also, I saw no recycling bins anywhere, and in the Cafe, everything was over packaged. We all thought this would help with the clear modern trend of being a more econsensitive traveler.

On my last trip I arrived late. Though I am Hilton Gold the type of room I requested was not available. By the time the rather uncaring receptionist got the room issue fixed as best he could (which was not too good at all) it was nearing 10 p.m. Before going to my room I asked which restaurants would be open. He indicated that the caf\u00e9 was open until 11. So, I went to my room, unpacked and then returned to the caf\u00e9 at about 10:15 only to be told that they closed at 10 but that I could get a diverse selection at the bar. I went to the bar only to be told that the kitchen was closed. I pointed out that the bar menu indicated that serviced was until 11 and was told \u201cOh yeah \u2013 we have to fix those menus \u2013 we stopped serving until 11 some time ago.

There is a larger pool not far from the Valley Wing that is much larger, and even has a slide. It seemed like most of the kids were hanging out in that area. The conference I attended was about 1200 people and I thought the meeting space was accommodated the size of group and activities planned very well. The continental breakfasts and lunches were also of good quality. My coworkers and I ate at one of the hotel restaurants, Frank & Alberts, for dinner as well as for breakfast. The food is excellent, however the staff were a little on edge. They were nice, but a little thrown off by special requests. The patio is beautiful. My only complaint is that there are a lot of birds that were sharing the patio with us at breakfast. As soon as other diners got up to leave, the birds would flock to the table for scraps.

We started out in a room in the main building that had been remodeled, it was awesome, very large and nice, but way too noisy since the bar was directly below the window. We hardly slept the first night. After that we moved to a new room in the Valley wing, but it was very dated and dark feeling. it did have a deck that overlooked the garden which was nice. Bathroom was small . The beds are comfy though. Didnt get much sleep the next two night either though, the tv mysteriously turned on in the middle of the night at 3:30 am, the remote was sitting across the room (poltergeist? ) , the alarm clock went off at 4:30 am the 3rd night even though we hadn't set it and it was unplugged from the wall, I guess it runs on battery. The pool area is nice, though it can be hard to find a seat as everyone comes out at 5 am and throws towels and books down onto all the chairs. (there are signs warning that there is no reserving seats, but nobody seems to pay attention). The gym has very nice equipment, about 6 treadmills and full set of machines, but the spa area is very out of shape. the men's locker room is very old and run down looking, not at all what you would expect at a spa like this. Needs a serious remodel. While we did enjoy our stay overall, the main thing that was lacking here was the service. Anytime we had to contact the front desk or anyone else at the hotel for anything, we were promised it would be taken care of, but it wasn't. This was a continual theme during our entire stay unfortunately, the staff was very friendly and seemed like they wanted to do the right thing, they just never followed through on anything at all. Very odd for a resort like this. Calling the concierge, I was on hold for over 30 minutes and they never did pick up. Coffee shop is very expensive, you pay 4.50 for a Grande Americano. Parking is first come first serve and it can be tricky to find a spot but at least it is free. We got a good deal on this hotel which is the reason why we stayed here, and I would say it was worth what I paid for it. If I had paid full price for this hotel, I probably would have felt a little ripped off. There are much nicer resorts in Scottsdale for that price.

When the hotel has seen every president visit since Herbert Hoover, how cool is that? However, this is 2012 and the standard for luxury has passed by this property, which is huffing and puffing to stay up to speed. We recently finished hosting a business conference there, so some of my comments will be more appropriate for those thinking of doing the same. But, some comments would be appropriate for anyone staying at the hotel. First, the good news. The outdoors is very well maintained at the Biltmore - perhaps a signature (along with the architecture) of the place. Wright's, the restaurant, serves top quality food and wines. Really, you might want to consider eating there, even if you have nothing else to do with the Biltmore. Not, the not so good news. Dated rooms seem to be the rule. I was upgraded to one of the villas, so it was quite large and included separate kitchen, living room and eating area. However, finishes were quite dated (I thought I had stepped back in time to the 70s) and my TV was about a 12 inch in diameter, CRT (not flat screen) that I think may have said \"Sylvania\" on it. Do they even exist any more? Banquet food was excellent at our dinners, but at the breakfast, two of our guests came down with a brief bout of food poisoning. One upset tummy could be specific to the person, two occurring about the same time seems suspicious. And, woe is you if you happen to check in or out at a busy time. Although the hotel staffs the front desk with 5+ people at busy times, these hard working people have no chance against the line up that forms. This happened to me and, I thought of asking for the price of an iPad when I finally got through the line....it seemed that long. I think the problem may be that, over time, the hotel has added more and more rooms without a material change to its front desk size, etc. Finally, a word on golf. When at the Biltmore, you may want to golf somewhere else. I was on the Links course and found the golf paths about as well paved as a country side road and the 'rough' to be basically dried up dirt and grass. Very disappointing course condition for a 'resort' that the Biltmore purports to be. All in all, it is fairly obvious that the Biltmore is trying to cut corners in a difficult economic environment. Good for them, but bad for you. If you want a nice competitor to a Doubletree or Holiday Inn type resort, choose the Biltmore. If you want a competitor to a top of the line resort, run away as fast as you can from the Biltmore. There are much, much better choices in AZ and the Phoenix area.

More on that later :( At check in, I inquired about upgrading our room. The woman at the front desk was completely clueless. My husband and I got the impression that she had never worked a front desk before and this was her first day working in the hotel industry. This is a WALDORF property! After about 15 minutes of her not understanding what I was asking for and my husband ready to completely lose his cool, I finally requested she find a manager. He was accommodating and found us an Ocatilla room, which we paid more money for. I don't understand how the resort's first foot forward could be someone so poorly trained and clueless. I talked my husband off the cliff and we headed to the room ready to put the past 30 minutes out of our mind and enjoy our vacation. Not so fast. We had asked the valet to get all of the bags out of the trunk and requested they be brought to the room. When they arrived, one of our bags was missing! Our bags had been sitting on a luggage cart the entire time we were hassling with the front desk and we were sent into panic mode as to where the bag could be. Murphy's law, it was the one bag that we absolutely could not lose. Eventually they found the bag (claimed it had never been taken out of the trunk) but WOW what a TERRIBLE start to this vacation! The rest of the stay was just okay. We got massages and facials in the spa and my husband said it was the worst massage he's ever had. Mine was pretty good.

Formica counters, vinyl tub and shower enclosure, stale smell, dirty carpet, 27 inch tube tv's...not what I expected for a room that goes for $700 per night on their website.

In short, this resort failed to provide the most basic amenities that any run-of-the-mill hotel should provide (e.g. a clean, functioning shower), and we wish we had stayed anywhere else. Details below. Guest experience: We were given a room with a tiny shower that did not drain properly, and the resort never fixed it, never offered us a different room, and never even apologized for making us shower in ankle-deep dirty water. Twice. Immediately after discovering the problem, my husband called the front desk to ask them to fix it while we were away at the wedding. I have no idea whether they actually sent anyone over while we were gone like they said they would, but we definitely had the same problem the next morning. Only that time there was also black debris spewing up from the drain while my husband showered. He was so disgusted that he got out and finished bathing in the soaking tub next to the shower. I told the front desk about the problem at check-out later that morning, and the guy simply made a note of what I said without so much as an apology or even a look of surprise. The rooms: Perhaps the rooms in the main building are nicer / more recently renovated, but our cottage room was 80s-tastic, tiny, and a bit grimy. There were giant red stains on the carpet, the commercial ceiling tiles (that's right) in the closet were crumbling, and the shower walls were moldy (which made it extra gross that we had to shower in standing water). Also, the only surface on which to place products in the shower was a sloped soap stand, and every time the precious balance of bar soap and bottles was disrupted, we had to fish our stuff out of the wading pool below. The shared amenities: The resort grounds are well-manicured, and the main building is interesting and beautifully appointed. The food and drinks were expensive yet very mediocre. Overall, we dropped $850 there in less than 48 hours, and I walked away wondering what exactly we paid for.

I didn't get a chance to really enjoy the resort's amenities due to the conference activities however I did see the pool area, which looked really nice, and the outdoor lounge areas were gorgeous. Lots of chairs and outdoor fireplaces which were great spots for reading and relaxing outside. I used the resort's fitness center and it was very nice. Lots of space with two separate rooms: one for lots of machines and the other with nautilus machines and room for one to do free weights, floor work,etc. I ate at Frank & Albert's restaurant in the resort. Once for dinner and once for breakfast and both were quite good. The dinner was especially good. The conference was in the resort so we also got to experience their conference facilities which were good. Standard amenities and the food was average for a conference. In terms of the rooms, the room was large and spacious with a nice little balcony. The decor is not my taste but I guess it was in keeping with the overall resort's look, although the common areas seemed to be a lot nicer than the room. The bathroom was very large but the resort's age was apparent in the water system. The water pressure in both the shower and toilets was quite low -- like it was running on an older plumbing system. Had they upgraded the bathrooms to more modern fixtures and functionality I think they could have kept the \"old world\" charm while still offering a more contemporary experience. I stayed in the Paradise wing of rooms and the elevators in that wing were awful. Again, another example of the resort's age. This wing had 4 floors and the elevator routinely stopped on every floor even if you did not press that floor and each time when the door opened to that floor, no one was there so it appears the elevator just stopped on that floor without being called. I was on the 4th floor, of course, so I had to suffer through stopping at every floor on nearly every elevator ride which was annoying by day 2. Overall I can see how this would be a lovely place to come with your family or friends for a relaxing vacation as the property seemed to have everything one would need for that experience in a nicely designed and furnished resort.

We regularly travel with my husband, my mother, my baby and myself so we are always looking for great 2 bedroom suites to have separate bedrooms and a common area. I also look for fabulous grounds for my family to play on and have the run of the place. The Biltmore far exceeded our needs and expectations. We had a rocky start when we checked in. I spend a great amount of time researching where we stay, reading reviews, getting the best deal and confirming my reservations. In this case I had another criteria which was to be able to check-in as early as possible and check-out as late as possible because we flew in on a 6 a.m. flight and would fly out on a 6 p.m. flight. I ended up booking through AMEX Platinum Concierge. I booked a 2 bedroom villa suite. It was a few dollars more than booking it through the hotel but it allowed for the late check out and came with 2 breakfasts per day and a resort credit. The requested an early check in but all the Villas were occupied so they were unable to honor the request. My only regret was that when we called the hotel after landing at the airport they did not inform us that we could rent a cabana by the pool that had its own kitchen and bathroom. It would have been a nice way to relax after getting up at 3 a.m. with a baby. We learned this the next day. We were told to go to the hotel to pre-register to get the earliest possible room which we did. When my husband checked in they told him it was just a one bedroom villa suite. I went inside myself to find out what was going on. They told me the same thing. I assured them that I had booked a two bedroom and that it was one of the main reasons we were staying there. They said they did not have any available. I then told them that I had booked one and what the price was per night on my confirmation. This immediately got their attention because the price on my reservation was for a 2 bedroom. They spent at least 20 minutes making a way. They told me that they would take care of it and gave us a time frame the room might be ready by. I appreciated the effort they made to make it right. I was actually thinking if it didn't work out it would be ok and I would go stay at the Holiday Inn and save a bunch of money. Fortunately, that did not happen because the resort was fabulous. The grounds were gorgeous but not arrogant. There were all types, classes, races and ages of people. They never frowned on kids running on their perfectly manicured green lawn. They actually had life size chess and checkers game on the lawn. The cafe served great Starbucks coffee and drinks. It closed a little too early on the weekend. The gym was great. The pools were fun. Unfortunately, unlike most 5 star hotels the service by the pool was lacking. There was one server trying to cover the whole pool and the area became covered in nasty wet towels quickly. The tennis courts were great. We were able to rent equipment and have a great time. We stayed in a Villa that was furthest away from the main resort but it was great. Also, each set of condos has their own pool. This meant we had a heated pool right outside our back door. Fortunately their was a gated area between the door and the pool because we have a one year old. The grounds are huge so be sure to bring your stroller. We actually bought one and don't know what we would have done without it. We ate the hotel restaurant, Frank and Alberts for breakfast everyday and had dinner there one night. They have a great breakfast menu and a great buffet. We enjoyed both. We sat outside for every meal. They have fire places and heaters and it was a great time. There is a wonderful business center with color printers. Unfortunately, they never refilled our mini bar beverages and snacks for some reason. We also had a hot water problem. During the first shower, after a simple shampoo, the water would turn cold. The happened on the king suite side and on the adjoining double bedroom side. Very strange. It was very nice but the kitchen and shower weren't as modern with appliances and tile and such as most upscale hotels we stay in but it was very nice and very clean. It was also great for putting a baby to bed and being able to stay up without disturbing his sleep. The curtains and drapes were great for room darkening although there was an art to closing them just right. The hotel grounds staff was also noisy as they roll their carts and towel bins up and down the street outside of the hotel and they would just congregate in the street outside our room and talk. The best I could tell a great number of them came to work at 5:30-6 every morning because that is when the baby would wake up abruptly and then we would hear them outside. I would absolutely stay here with my family again. I would be interested in reserving one of the cottages on the other side of the property.

Expensive, but idyllic ... and it feels like I've been to lots of expensive but NOT idyllic places in recent years, so I suppose that that makes the Arizona Biltmore a great value, right? The hotel was designed by architect Albert Chase McArthur, but you'd never know it was designed by anyone other than Frank Lloyd Wright, who served as a consultant to McArthur during design and construction on the use of the gray cast masonry units used for much of the hotel's construction. It certainly looks and feels like a late-ish career Wright building, and the hotel's various owners have intentionally played up the connection, adding Wright-designed stained glass and other touches over the years. Whatever. Regardless of which of the two architects is responsible for what percentages of the hotel's design, it's a delightful place, perhaps made even more delightful by the blending of their design DNA. Every little nook and cranny is beautiful, and the hotel is filled with wonderful benches, chairs, and perches that you'll long to curl up on for a hour or two of reading or people-watching. We've stayed here twice over the years - once about 15 years ago, and then just last week. On our first visit we stayed in one of the newer units - sort of like freestanding wings with a number of guest rooms, connected to the main building by beautifully landscaped pathways and loggias. On our second visit we stayed in the main building. Personally, I preferred the main building - it's the oldest building in the complex, and I like its originalness. But there is a little more hubbub there, so some might prefer the newer units for greater solitude. The main building has four floors, with the lobby on the ground floor and guest rooms on the upper three floors. We requested a room on the top (fourth) floor, and it was perfectly quiet. I suspect the second and third floors would have been a little noisier - but, knowing the care they take here, probably not MUCH noisier. On both of our visits, the place seemed to be booked solid with weddings - I'd guess three or four each day, and our visits were during off-season months. Surely people in Phoenix get married in other places, but you'd never know it from looking at the event roster here. So, be prepared for lots of formalwear and for gardens occasionally being closed to the public for ceremonies and photo shoots. The grounds are enormous, though, so it really isn't much of an intrusion. And if you're a romantic, it's an absolute delight seeing all these (mostly) young people running around so happy and in love. Service is of course great here, although maybe not QUITE as great as it could be. I spent an hour sitting in one of the comfy Adirondack chairs lining the hexagonal green behind the main building, ringed by walkways stretching out to the rest of the grounds, and no server appeared to ask if I wanted a beverage or snack. An hour! This is a small problem, I realize, and otherwise service was great. If you want a spa treatment (massage, hair, facial, manicure, etc.), you'd better book it as far in advance as you can; the aforementioned weddings will otherwise take up every available time slot. We find this place to be totally relaxing. It is, however, probably NOT the best choice for people who want to experience Phoenix - it's sort of off in its own bubble, surrounded by lots of upscale homes and shops. If you want to see the city, it's probaly better to stay closer to downtown (like, Hotel Tally Ho).", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "El Paso, Texas", "Title": "\u201cHistoric Desert Resort\u201d", "Author": "dlyerly", "ReviewID": "UR125179855", "Content": "We've been to Phoenix/Scottsdale many times over the years.

Breakfast (mainly pastries, wonderful fresh fruit and yogurts). My only compaint was there was no real protein in the mornings. But excellent coffee. - Apps / light dinner: quite amazing food, really. Included things like mini quiches, wings, fresh veggies, mini cheeseburgers (yum) and plenty of nuts/snakcs - Desserts: fair assortment of rich but bite size goodies - Free wine/beer: this is bar far the best part. If you drink in the bars at the Biltmore, prepare to spend $12 - $15 / drink! They are amazing, but really? SO to grab a couple glasses of wine each night here really made more sense. The room we got was an ADA one (which I always seem to get). It was quite possibly the largest room (square foot size) i have ever been in. The walk-in closet could sleep 2 people alone! But they were missing a couple things: no floor length mirror anywhere; the bathroom light switch was outside the bathroom itself; very poor lighting in a large room. Good things included a nice shared patio that looks out onto the pool. A note about the pool: the bar here was never staffed. If you wanted service, you needed to go to the main pool or call room service. If staying at the Biltmore be prepared to walk a ways. The grounds are spread out but lovely!

I am going to tell you what the hotel did NOT tell me, that they should have: An enormous group books almost the entire property for a \"Passover VIP\" event (apparently many many years running). The issue for any innocent individual family is the following: 100% of the cabanas are booked by this group. So, during your entire stya, even if you wanted to spring the $200 plus (we did) for a cabana, it is not an option; the stunning main grounds on the interior of the property are set up for this group. So, if you want to have a drink, you won't be overlooking the gardens and walkways, you will be overlooking a group that is probably close to 800 people. The group I had no issue with: families enjoying their time as a group. But the \"full and fair\" use of the Biltmore I have a huge issue with. We didn't get to use many many of the amenities because of such a large group. A small (honestly maybe 10-15 families) group of us just sat shell-shocked by the pool because the resort was clearly scrambling to deal with their biggest paying customer of the weekend. Fair enough. But when we made the reservation, I can't imagine why they wouldn't have said \"Full disclosure...we have an enormous group here Easter weekend every year. No cabanas will be available during your stay, and most of the chairs by the main pool will be reserved (in advance) by this group. The tiny upside: this group ate all of their meals in the various banquet facilites, so all the restaurants (except for by the pool) were very serene.

Lowlights: lack of attention to detail, has some of the feel of a chain hotel, overall experience definitely not stellar. This is a fairly detailed review of our recent stay (12/26-30) at the Biltmore. My wife and I have stayed at several high-end hotels belonging to various \"groups\", and the Biltmore unfortunately rates lower than most in this category. We're not picky or pretentious, but we do value attentive, outgoing service and quality, so this review should be considered from that perspective. 1) Ocatilla Room We stayed in the Ocatilla wing of the hotel, on the first floor. What was good: - Spacious room. - Very comfortable king-size bed. - Nice decor. - Deep soaking tub with faucets placed to the side, which allows two people to soak together. The supply of a candle was a nice touch. What wasn't so good: - The bathroom should be called \"The Door Puzzle\". The main door, shower door and toilet closet door all open onto each other. It's actually possible to inadvertently \"lock\" someone in the toilet closet by leaving the bathroom door open at some angles. - The bathroom does not have a lit make-up mirror; this is almost inexcusable for a high-end hotel. - The room door does not close flush against the door frame such that whenever any of the other rooms' doors open or close, it rattles back and forth against the frame and this can wake you up. - The safe is *very* tiny. 2) Ocatilla Lounge - The lounge is too small for such a large wing with so many rooms / guests. The food display area is too small and is easily overcrowded. The serving dishes are also too small and this requires the waitstaff to constantly go back and forth to the kitchen to refill them. - The lounge serves continental breakfast until 9:30 on weekdays and 10 on weekends / holidays. Does anyone *really* get up that early when on holiday - or any day when on vacation? This isn't a business hotel after all, and it's a stretch to call it a resort with hours like that. 3) Pools - The pool water is too cold. Maybe the temperature is OK for mid-summer, but certainly not December. We tried going into both the Ocatilla and main pools, and they were simply too cold. We saw several people go in and come out rapidly. C'mon, this is a Waldorf-Astoria property, and the water is colder than at some economy hotels! - There was a good quantity of chairs and towels. 4) Restaurants - Frank and Albert's had both good service and food. The food was fresh and really delicious. Several dishes were remarkably good. - Wright's, the premier restaurant, had very good food, but the service was rather disorganized. Our amuse-bouche were not delivered before the main dishes, and the waitstaff did not seem to understand their respective roles (e.g., we were asked by both the waiter and the busboy if we wanted coffee). 5) Gym - There was plenty of exercise equipment and all of it was in good condition. - Towels and water are supplied. 6) Grounds - The grounds are well maintained and all trees/bushes/plants are nicely arranged. 7) Staff This is maybe the most important aspect of a hotel/resort experience so this is where we are the most critical or appreciative. - We found the administrative / clerical staff to be somewhat aloof and unwelcoming. None were warm or engaging. - The valet, bellhop and restaurant staff were good. All were helpful and attentive. - A few of them stand out: - When we arrived late to the Ocatilla lounge on our first morning, the desk staff simply told us that breakfast was over. Diego, one of the waitstaff overheard the conversation: he approached us afterwards and thoughtfully offered to go to the kitchen and collect some remaining pastries and fruits for us. - We decided to take a walk to a restaurant a couple of miles away, and one of the bellhops at the front entrance described a shortcut to us, and when we started to walk away Spencer asked if we would like some water bottles to take along, which we gratefully accepted. It was a small gesture, but the thoughtfulness one expects from good staff. My wife wondered if this was because the latter staff understand the relationship between their attitude and tips ;-) Lastly, while we understand that housekeeping staff are not generally the best paid, only one of the five we encountered could speak any English. This made for at least one challenging situation when we were trying to explain to one of the housekeepers that she should come back to the room in 20 minutes. Please note that this is not a racially or nationality motivated comment - rather, it's simply an observation that Hilton should ensure at least basic English speaking skills for all of its staff (or provide training). 8) In Summary - Room: 4/5 - Food: 5/5 - Facilities/Grounds: 4/5 - Service: 4/5 9) Final Verdict We've stayed twice before at The Phoenician and this was our first stay at the Biltmore. Our verdict is that The Phoenician it's definitely a notch above the Biltmore.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "BrigidC", "ReviewID": "UR122377545", "Content": "We just returned from a 4 day stay at the Arizona Biltmore.

I can't count the amount of times we said to each other \"wow, this place is awesome.\" We very much enjoyed the spa,the only drawback being the small/sparse waiting area, but the staff and treatments were superb.

On the plus side, when I discussed these disappointments with the manager, he was very helpful and did his best to make things right, without hesitation. So, kudos to him. They just need a little fine tuning to make it the place that it either should be or once was. From a pure value perspective, the room rate was outstanding but it was likely due to the time of year.

Our sons, 6 and 13 were tired and crabby. At 2am, room service was the only option. As vegans, room service can be quite a challenge but not at this hotel. Our boys are not vegan and they had a marvelous thin crust cheese pizza- the crust was delightfully crispy and my boys were happy with a sufficiently gooey cheese that was not tired and dried out as room service can be. For my husband and I, we revised the chicken burrito into an incredible black bean burrito with fresh salsa, guacamole, and a spicy black bean sauce. All of us enjoyed mixed green salad with tomatoes dressed with a balsamic vinaigrette. The sourdough bread rolls were warm and crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. For dessert, we had a marvelous fresh platter of assorted fruits- pineapple, watermelon, cantaloupe, blueberries and blackberries. Prices for these fresh and healthy alternatives were very reasonable. the service did not stop there. The next evening for dinner, my son and husband had developed a cold with fever and chills and simply did not wish to leave the room. Thinking to surprise them with something enticing when they woke up, I searched the casual restaurant menu of Frank and Albert's for some vegan faire but was disappointed that there were very few alternatives. When trying to fashion existing faire into a corresponding vegan meal with the hostess, she volunteered that it would be better for me to speak with Chef Jason since he would simply make whatever we wanted..and make he did. First he queried our likes and dislikes pretty extensively and then asked if there were any special things we wanted to eat. He prepared a hearty black bean soup garnished with pickled carrots, onions and mild peppers, stuffed red peppers served with a delicious roasted red pepper coulis and a carpaccio of portabello mushrooms served with with a julienne of mixed vegetables, a mixed salad with fresh seasoned artichoke, two types of olives, and heirloom tomato dressed with a white balsamic vinaigrette. He meticulously packed it up to go including extra roasted red pepper sauce, extra stuffing, extra pickled garnish, and the vinaigrette and placed the soup in a thermos to keep it warm. He did not stop there. When I told him my 6 year old wanted bacon and broccoli, he prepared one of his favorite dishes- thinly cut french fries tossed with pancetta and two other types of diced bacon held together by melted cheddar cheese. And in case my son did not like it, he added a few strips of bacon on the side for him. Much to my son's delight, the broccoli was fresh and perfectly cooked- not mushy or crunchy and he loved the french fries concoction! Chef Jason gave me his card and told me that he would be pleased to meet our food needs at any time. He also introduced me to another chef who could also be contacted in the event that he was not available. It really was an amazing and kind service that is quite lacking in this automated world. The amount of care that was offered was quite unlike what we have experienced before- my husband and I are million mile travelers and we have seen our share of cursory service, but not here.

It was horrible and my back was sore and I decided that today my boyfriend and I should splurge and get a really nice room. The Arizona Biltmore looks really nice in the pictures on their website, but it was about the worst disaster I've ever had in any hotel. My boyfriend and I get into our room. It was a nonsmoking room with a balcony that you were allowed to go out and smoke on. We were super tired from driving and went outside to smoke cigarettes and sit down. This psycho lady two floors up from us screams down - and i kid you not- ARE YOU SMOKING? um, yes. we're allowed to. NO YOU'RE NOT. STOP. NOW. um.... no? So I went inside to call the front desk because I was afraid that maybe we misunderstood and it was a fully nonsmoking hotel. They said it was fine to smoke on the balconies. (I found out later that they actually sell cigars in the front lobby - it was a pretty smoker-friendly hotel). So we go back outside to try and finish out cigarettes, and this absolute lunatic of a woman starts screaming at us again: ARE YOU SMOKING AGAIN. yes, we called the front desk and they said we're allowed to. WELL I JUST CALLED THE FRONT DESK TOO AND THEY SAID YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO. um, i'm not sure what to tell you. we called and you're allowed to. NO YOU'RE NOT. I HAVE A BABY UP HERE. STOP SMOKING RIGHT NOW. can we please not have a screaming match in this nice hotel? STOP SMOKING! (mind you, i would never smoke next to a baby. but her room was two floors up from us with a sliding door to close off, and there were several other people on their balconies that were also smoking. they were also kind of staring at us). So i called security, and he had to verify with the MOD about the smoking policy, and i'm getting pretty frazzed because we seriously walked in and had this psycho lady start screaming at us, and I think the room cost about $300, and I really just wanted to sit down and relax. Security went and talked to the crazy people, but then we were basically asked if we wanted to just move rooms. While this is going on, the lady upstairs dumps water over her balcony onto our table outside, with my boyfriend's wallet, cigarettes and lighter. We move rooms, and then head to the bar to get a drink. I sit down and start reading some of the material that they gave me when I checked in, and see, to my absolute horror, that we've gotten this letter saying that the water is going to be turned off from 10 pm to 5 am for the two days that we were staying here. Like, if you want to brush your teeth you need to use the $8 Fiji water in the mini bar. ARE YOU KIDDING? No one said anything about there not being water in the room while we were booking the room or checking in, it was in this super secret envelope that they slipped to you with a bunch of other stuff when we checked in. Back to the front desk to try and move to a room that maybe has water so i can have the luxurious amenity of a SHOWER. they moved our room and gave us a discount, but the verdict on the room that we're in now: IT TOTALLY BLOWS. It's a \"suite\" which is a code word for a gigantic room with very little furniture in it. There's a bed and a couch and chairs, and this HUGE empty space in the middle of the room. The bathtub sucks and the water doesn't get hot enough. The room seems really dated and old, just with new sheets and towels, but the wallpaper is kind of peeling and the fixtures for everything are all really old looking. so my verdict on the whole hotel: the grounds are very beautiful. everything else is lame. stay somewhere else. And to the crazy lady upstairs: DUDE. CALM DOWN. You need to seriously take a valium or something.

We enjoyed walking through the Biltmore Estates every afternoon. The Bad: Many of the rooms are dated and need to be renovated. Conference rooms are far from the main portion of the hotel and appear to be an afterthought. $12.00 mandatory charge for bellman service, whether you use it or not. The Ugly: I got food poisoning while staying at this hotel, and I am not the only person who got ill at this conference. Wi-Fi service was new and did not work properly. No free Wi-Fi in the conference rooms, when I asked for the password I was told there is a $350.00 charge. I had such high hopes for this hotel. I stayed at the hotel as part of a large conference, and it quickly became clear that the hotel was not equipped to handle a conference this large. We got to our room and discovered that the wireless was not working, when I called the front desk they acted like they did not know what I was talking about and claimed that they had not received any complaints. The next morning as I started talking to other conference attendees it became clear that there was a problem throughout the property as at least half of the conference participants had experienced issues. I then went to the front desk, it turns out that they had just upgraded to wireless service and they were having implementation issues, however, they agreed to move us to a villa, at no extra charge(where they said the wi-fi would be working). I was pleased with this as there was a huge discrepancy in the rooms, many people were complaining that the furnishings were worn and that outlets didn\u2019t work or pictures were falling off the walls (I personally know 2 people that had the same issues). The villa they moved us to, although very large and well kept, had not been updated since the 80\u2019s (both the bathroom and kitchen while clean and well kept desperately needed updates). If I had paid full price for the villa, I would have been annoyed. I was annoyed when 12 hours after moving into the villa the WiFi stopped working. The conference center was poorly laid out and difficult to both get to and navigate. The food was marginal, and as I mentioned about I came down with a case of food poisoning halfway through my stay and since I had only eaten on the property for 48 hours preceding my illness, I am positive it was related to the hotel. The staff is the one bright spot in my stay and while they did everything they could to be accommodating, it is clear that the hotel is simply was not set up to handle a conference of our size.

We were told the hotel had a lot of VIP guests checking out and they had priority - if they don't want to check out, too bad. The thing was, housekeeping told us our rooms were cleaned already. We were hassled going to the main pool while waiting for the room, forced to prove we were hotel guests because there was a draft party going on at the time. My young children were hassled by drunken guests at the pool while we were trying to enter (during daylight hours in 115 degree heat). Once we checked in, our building lost water for hours and the hotel couldn't give us an explanation of what happened or the expected duration. During my husband's most recent stay, the hotel moved him to the Ocatilla building but wouldn't allow him access to the lounge. Given the minimal refreshments available in the lounge, access doesn't really cost the hotel much but they definitely don't care about goodwill.

I took today's History Tour, free from the Concierge Desk, and it was very enjoyable. I could easily picture Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli and Sammy Davis Jnr at the piano, waking those who'd gone to bed early! The gardens are spacious and well tended and there are fountains here and there, adding to the atmosphere. We were here for a conference and had a pleasant room at the rear of the Terrace Block. I was romantically hoping for something rather out of the ordinary and whilst we have (I'm in the room as I write!) a spacious bathroom with walk in shower, the separate bath is bog standard and the basins are housed in plastic work top. Not exactly high end like Sofitel at T5, for example. The room has more than a nod to Frank Lloyd Wright with nice wooden Arts and Crafts style furniture - just a pity that the bedside tables haven't been protected and so have been water damaged, for example. However, there's a balcony with seating and the bed's comfortable. The large armchairs are nice, if somewhat crammed into the corner. Friends were given a Fountain Court suite, somewhat like a mini apartment. Again the space was great, with kitchen, lounge and dining area as a plus, however, this particular one was in need of a refresh. The carpet was grim. Not that they were complaining as this was an upgrade for them at no extra charge. However, if they'd paid a load extra for it, it honesty didn't cut the mustard. The fourth floor was being refurbed and, I suppose, with 740 odd rooms, it's a constant battle. What really set this place apart, for us, was the dining. Excellent food is available, the breakfasts are incredible with piping hot and delicious stacks of pancakes and delicately flavored French toast of epic proportions! For dinner we had beef Wellington, which was very good indeed. The lunch menu is good too. Cobb salad at the pool arrived in a cocktail shaker! It allowed the dressing to be mixed well! We had planned to share lunch, however, and just this once this was a single serving! Heyho! I helped our friends with their mega salad. It's a hard life!

Well, there's a coffee bar adjacent to a nice outdoor seating area. I liked having that option in the morning and the coffee was decent.

Our room was a bit small, and while comfortable, it did not have a view but looked out onto a rooftop directly outside our room. The bathroom was nice, and as a female, I greatly appreciated several things: 1) a lighted, extendable makeup mirror 2) an extra shelf above the vanity to keep items out of the way and from getting wet 3) a really nice quality hair dryer was supplied with multiple heats and speeds, rather than the cheap ones they usually provide in hotels. 4) nice quality amenities like shampoo and conditioner Also enjoyed having a bathrobe. We got complimentary internet access in the room and that was great too, as we used it a lot. But other than that, the room is very plain and ordinary. Bed was comfortable, and housekeeping service was very attentive. On the downside, the bathtub did not drain so we were standing in dirty water every time we took a shower. So, the room was average, but the rest of the hotel, fabulous. The lobby and public areas are the nicest of any hotel I have seen. So many different areas to sit and relax, talk or read. Gorgeous architecture and really nice renovation. The history of the hotel is so interesting, and I highly recommend the free onsite history tour.

I did not sleep at all well. Secondly, we received a 5:30 a.m. wake up call one morning, even though we had not ordered it.

What a shame what Astoria has done to the Biltmore. A beautiful property with lovely architecture, but the worst rooms, service and dirty on top of it! Not to knock another hotel, but this was barely one step above a motel 6! I was a bit skeptical after reading the many negative online reviews but really wanted to see the property and stay in what I thought was a piece of Arizona history. The hotel is in a lovely area of Phoenix and the grounds are magnificent. Because of reading many less than positive reviews I wanted to check out a few rooms before I chose one. I had booked through American Express Fine Hotel program so expected something special. Wow, what a disappointment! Steve at the front desk was very nice, efficient and professional and gave me several choices of room options. A very nice security guard took me around to show me the rooms he had selected for me to see. One was shabbier than the next! I finally chose a room in the \u201cconcierge\u201d section Ocotillo I believe they call it. It has a lounge, which was very nice with food and drink service and that was very nice. The room was THE PITS! Shabby furniture, tiny bathroom, skimpy towels, poor bath amenities and looked dirty. The bathrooms \u201chave been remodeled\u201d I was told. Wow, they need to send their CEO to stay in a room and test it out. The shower didn\u2019t even have a place to put your shampoo! The toilet area was so small you practically had to go in sideways. No first class AT ALL. The furniture was chipped, fingerprints and stains and very skimpy amenities. A robe, but no slippers! Cheap pads and pens and no bottled water included. There was NO turn down service, none! And this was the \u201cconcierge\u201d building! Amazing that they are still in business. The bed was uncomfortable and the lines less than first class. Mind you the room rate was over $300 a night so I expected first class everything. Even the fan in the bathroom was the cheapest possible and noisy! The \u201cimproved\u201d (so I was told) Internet did not work; fortunately I had an air card on my laptop. The property is beautiful, very spread out and poor signage to direct you around. I do have to say the food in the restaurants was excellent; however again, the service was hit or miss. Every day I had breakfast in the caf\u00e9 and there was no salt and pepper on the table and had to ask for it each time. The service was not at all 5 star. All in all, I would say this was the low point of my visit to Phoenix and I had such high hopes, a real disappointment! Also, watch your bill, they add on a \u201cresort charge\u201d for nothing and charge for self-parking in a cramped far away lot, amazing that they are still in business!

The first two years we enjoyed very much even though the stay is quite pricey. This year we found the service was slow and not as top notch as in the past. It's a beautiful resort and great venue for our conference each year. There are a number of meeting rooms for business meetings or special occasions and the grounds are perfect locations for outdoor gatherings. Sunset is especially beautiful with fire pits and large outside seating areas for food or drinks or admiring the mountain views. The 2 bars are great places for socializing and are easily located off the lobby. The property has 39 acres with a variety of lodgings. From cottages (small but cozy)scattered about the spacious grounds (some with jacuzzi and private grassy areas that would be perfect for large family reunions), to small rooms located inside the main buliding, or larger rooms located in outer bulidings (many of the outer bulidings have separate swimming pools), or the larger villas. There is a terrific spa with a very well equipped gym and about 7 or more tennis courts. The property was built in the 1920's in the Frank Lloyd Wright style with art deco furnishings in the accomodations as well as the puplic areas of the resort which are all very well maintained! There is a lot of hisory behind the walls of the Biltmore from it's beginnings to it's famous guests list. We have stayed in the Terrace Rooms (with a small quiet pool for guests) which have either ground floor private patios or private balconies on the upper floors. We always request mountain views which are magnificant at sunset. The rooms/bathroom are separated and large. The furnishings are in soft tones. We have never found the rooms to be less than clean and comfortable.....I'm very fussy about the condition of my room and have never had a complaint. We have also stayed in the newly renovated Ocatilla building that's considered a \"hotel within a hotel\" because of the concierge service and a separate room that serves complimentary snacks and drinks at certain times of the day along with other amenities that are only offered to guests in that building. These rooms are very spacious with an abundance of light from the french balcony on the upper floors (floor to ceiling sliding door) or the patios on the ground floor. The Ocatilla building has it's own fountain & large pool which much more tranqil than the main pool (the main pool has a large water slide, cabanas, and a Cabana Club Restaurant - great for families). The bathrooms, in the Ocatilla rooms, are tiled and very nice with a separate toilet room (very very small - 2 1/2 foot by 5 foot - too small for a large person), double sinks, large shower stall and good size bath tub. The iced water dispensers around the pool areas are a real plus especially when the weather in Phoenix can be very HOT!!!! The children's play area is very well equiped and the resort has a children's day care with supervised activities for all ages. The shops are extremely over prices - better to go to the mall down the road. The cafe is a great place for light food and Starbuck's coffee. The Frank & Albert's restaurant and the Wright's at the Biltmore have wonderful food. My husband is a foody and we found the restaurants' chefs had put together a yummy variety of dishes. Even though the service was a bit slow, we really enjoyed eating at both restaurants. A private town car from the airport was $35 one way. Overall, this is a lovely place to visit.....at least once.

As mentioned in many of the other reviews the public areas, grounds and without question the pools were spectacular. This a a Waldorf-Astoria property and with that name comes some pretty lofty expectations. While the above mentioned areas met those expectations the room itself did not. The Good: Great location, near downtown Phoenix, including the baseball and basketball arenas. The grounds were beautiful, the pools were spectacular and parking was convenient and plentiful. The ok: Service was spotty, some of the staff were very polite and professional and consistent with what you would expect at a 5-star hotel. Others were gruff and less helpful. One example: While checking in at 2:30 the clerk let me know that they didn't have a room available for me yet. He asked for a phone number to contact me when it was available which i provided. I politely asked when did he think the room would be ready and he replied, \"just so you know check-in isn't guaranteed until 4pm.\" That wasn't my question. I wasn't in a rush to check in I just was wanted to plan my time accordingly. If he didn't know he could have just said 4pm. The disappointing: The room was very basic, the AC didn't cool the room very well. I called twice for service but they told me it was working as it should however it was uncomfortably warm for my taste and unpleasant to sleep. When I went to visit a colleague in her room it was much cooler than mine. The rooms only have wired internet service and the tab on the cable was broken so it kept falling out of the network jack on my laptop. There were no available outlets by the desk (the two existing outlets were taken by the lamp and modem). So I needed to use the laptop by the desk because of the cable but there was no outlet to plug the laptop in. I don't know why the hotel wouldn't use lamps with outlets built in like they have at almost every hotel I stay at these days. Finally, when I checked in the valet asked to park my car, he said it was free valet parking. So I said yes. Upon checkout I had a charge for $27. When I inquired at the front desk about the charge I was informed that free valet is only before (sometime I don't recall the exact time) and since I had left my car overnight I was charged the fee. That wasn't made clear at the time.

It is spacious, stylish and has character. - purpose - We attended for a conference and it suited that purpose very well. - buildings - It consists of historic parts and newer parts - we preferred and stayed in the main building. Some of this looks a bit tired, (80s or 90s tired rather than 30s tired). It is an historic building (Frank Lloyd Wright and all) - as evidenced by its reputation and by the framed newspaper cuttings. Unfortunately the history is often hidden, with an explanatory tour of the hotel for guests only occurring once a week. - location - It is not particularly close to anything because it was originally built to be out of town. Since then the town has caught up with it so where once (in the 30s) guests would have been surrounded by orchards or desert, it is now surrounded by suburbs (and a golf course). It still has a spacious desert feel. facilities - the facilities are good - the restaurants are excellent particularly breakfast. The staff are generally friendly and pleasant.

The carpet behind the door and along room edges was off white, nice and clean while the traffic areas were dark and grimy. The sheer curtains dark and dirty at the bottom edges.

I stayed there for five nights at the end of July and beginning of August. The property is absolutely beautiful, and it's worth seeing even if you don't stay there. I had looked forward to my stay at the hotel for a long time, and thankfully it's beautiful enough that I was able to overcome the poor service and maintenance issues. The big problem with this hotel is probably that it's in the Waldorf Astoria portfolio. This is supposed to be the flagship Hilton brand with exceptional customer service. The reality is far different. I had a room in the Terrace Court area, and the first thing I encountered was that the air conditioner could not adequately cool the room. The second thing I noticed was minor maintenance issues around the room and the bathroom, such as peeling wallpaper on walls, peeling paint on the ceiling, and a door that didn't close. It's not a huge issue, but at a Waldorf Astoria property these kinds of things should be dealt with immediately. Finally, there were some serious customer service problems attempting to get towels at the pool. After making several calls, visiting the front desk, and waiting more than an hour, we still didn't have towels at the pool...instead we just had excuses from resort staff who seemed apathetic and unwilling to accept responsibility for the problems. It took well over and hour and a second trip up to the front desk for the hotel staff to finally admit to the service problems. Finally, the rooms don't have wireless internet. I was staying at the hotel for a business conference, and everyone in my room had to keep sharing the one wired internet port. I understand this is an old resort, but as a Waldorf Astoria property and at the rates they charge, there's no excuse to not have wireless in all the rooms by 2011. This could be a world class hotel if they would maintain the rooms better and if they could get the communications and customer service issues under control with the hotel staff. My stay overall was poor, but because of the beauty of the property grounds and main building, I'm bumping my rating up to average. One thing worth mentioning is the restaurant - Frank & Albert's.

Even though we live in Arizona, this was our first time to the Biltmore. It is a beautiful, historic hotel and resort that is tucked away quietly in the middle of a busy city. We were there for a conference and were lucky to be able to secure a very good rate for the room. I was very excited to be staying there for the first time! The grounds are beautiful and it was amazing to see the photos on the wall of the resort in its prime! There were so many very cool people who have stayed there and this resort is certainly part of our heritage in our beautiful state. The staff was very friendly upon check-in. When I went to my room, I was under-whelmed to say the least. It did have a very nice view of the golf course, but was extremely dated and very worn. I checked out a friends room, only three doors down and was interested to learn that he had a nicely renovated room. Since I was planning on having a young visitor I asked the front desk if I could have a new room. They were very helpful and showed me a few rooms until I found one that was more suitable for my needs. I got help from a nice bellman and got all my stuff to a new room. I thought I was in heaven until I saw that there was no soap in my room and there were used towels in the bathroom. I tried to find a member of the cleaning staff who could understand my desire to have the room cleaned and finally found someone who understood what I was trying to say. I then left for awhile to go to class. When I returned to the room I thought it was hot, so turned down the A/C. Nothing, still very, very hot in the room. I then went rinse something out in the sink and the plunger broke, not allowing the water to drain. I called the front desk and the sent someone immediately to fix the stuff. He quickly fixed the sink and said he thought it may take awhile for the room to cool down. A short while later I got a call from the front desk to ensure that everything had been fixed. I told them that the sink got fixed, but the room was still very hot! The immediately offered to give me another room. So, once again, I packed back up and moved to a very close room. This one had working A/C and was heaven! That night I went to bed and hear the toilet running constantly. I was embarrassed to call the front desk and complain again, so I left a note for the maid. When I came back to my room the toilet was fixed. However, one flush and it broke again. Again, I was tired of complaining, so I took the lid off the tank to see what the problem was. The toilet needed a new flushing mechanism. I ended up leaving the lid off the tank the entire time and literally lifting the chain to manually flush the toilet. We ate several times at the Frank and Albert's restaurant. The food was fantastic each time, but holy cow the prices! $4 for a soda.....really? If you go to this restaurant, please ask for VICTORIA! She was one of the best servers we have had anywhere. Very helpful and friendly. She helped us entertain our young daughter and went out of her way to ensure we were happy. I guess that people who are fortunate enough to stay there and pay the normal rate don't blink an eye at a $50 breakfast, but for us it was a bit steep. The food, like I said was great, but a bit much for our budget. I will come back for special occasions for sure though! All in all it was a really fun stay.

When my husband and I arrived and made our way from the parking garage, we passed through--guess what?--many buildings labeled \"cottages.\" The front desk was puzzled by this gaffe, and we will try again the next time we visit.

Had he been in the shower at the time, well..... The staff members were eager to make things right when we brought things to their attention. (We hadn't mentioned the shower...) Our keys demagnetized four times--no exaggeration, despite our keeping them away from cell phones, coins, etc.--and when we went to the clerk yet again to have them fixed, the clerk said that such problems were not acceptable and, to our surprise, gave us a small but appreciated credit on our bill.

As a child, we always spent weekends at the Biltmore during the summer and had brunch in the Gold Room almost every Sunday. For more than 30 years I have been in awe of this jewel in the desert. with it's perfectly manicured gardens, lawn croquet and chess, multiple pools and wonderful Frank Lloyd Wright influence. It has always transported me back in time....movie stars, presidents and locals alike have always come here to relax in luxury. The back veranda facing what used to be called Squaw Peak was a favorite place to lounge and play backgammon while my grandfather drank martinis and I had a Shirley Temple. Fast forward thirty years and the new influence of the Waldorf Astoria ownership has made this jewel the Tiffany's of AZ resorts. Now I drink the martinis with my partner and my friends but we still have the same gorgeous view and we still play backgammon on the back veranda. From the friendliest staff, pool attendants, housekeeping, the wonderful spa and of so comfy rooms....they are even better than before. You can even bring your dog who will enjoy its very own special menu too. Our Cavalier King Charles puppy loved staying there too! His first hotel experience was at the Arizona Biltmore. So the next time you visit Phoenix....I encourage you to hand yourself over to the Arizona Biltmore because just when I thought a hotel experience couldn't get better, it was more exquisite than ever before......the Arizona Biltmore is the crown jewel for us. My partner and I made a promise to each other on June 11, 2011 while on the veranda playing backgammon, that for as long as we live....we will always come back and spend one week every summer at this magical desert resort.

I had not stayed at the hotel prior, and was unsure of what to expect of the resort, particularly considering that I was not attending any events at the hotel (I was simply using the resort as a business hotel). The major take away for me is that the property is beautiful, but unless I was coming back for an event on property, I likely would not go back because as a resort it isn't really designed for a typical business traveler (e.g., a lot of walking to get to your car, parking is far away, resort fee). If I was traveling for pleasure, I would check to see if there were any large meetings and avoid those dates to ensure a calm, quiet stay. The hotel is lovely and particularly beautiful at night. The lobby is lit up well, and can be a very comfortable work/social area. Valet parking is easiest, but at about $27/night I chose to self-park. There are limited spaces in front down a long row that I managed to use for a few days, but otherwise I had to park in a garage which is a good 10-minute walk from the entrance. The property has several restaurants and bars, and in the middle of the resort there is a decent amount of outdoor space that offers seating with fire pits for a relaxing evening. There is a coffee shop/Starbucks on property which was nice when needing something quick in the morning, but like everything else on the property the prices were on the high side -- I think my coffee and bagel was $10. I found the service overall to be about average. I didn't find that anybody was going out of their way to provide a memorable experience. When I checked-in I was not recognized as a Gold member nor were any benefits offered (I had to ask). After asking, as a Gold member I received a room upgrade (to the Terrace area) and 2 alcoholic drinks in the bar (up to $14 each). I also was given 2 free waters from the mini-bar. The room was very large and comfortable, but very traditional. I think the room could benefit from a facelift, bringing a few more modern elements to the room. Nonetheless it was quiet and I slept very well on the typical Hilton bed. It had a nice patio, a huge bathroom with separate make-up area, shower, and large closet.

He isn't the \"official\" architect, but his influence is apparent (he was \"consulting\" arch). We vowed to come stay here. I brought my husband here for his birthday and it was perfect, he had come here as a child for Christmas and never forgot it. I can see why. The architecture is magnificent as was the service. Okay, they upgraded us to a Villa, I think partially because we were celebrating a birthday, which took everything over the top. The grounds are top notch and pleasant to walk around. The food at the restaurants was incredible. I could hang in the main building all day, it really is magnificent (I'd better come up with another adjective). Go upstairs and check out the Biltmore History room and just marvel at all the nooks and places to sit and enjoy another vantage point. This resort does take you to another time and place - you definitely get out of the main stream and settle into another world, which makes it a great vacation spot. We got a great deal - search the web site for specials and packages, it is well worth it. We had 3 meals thrown into our rate, and since the resort was the destination we took advantage of it, which made this wildly affordable. Here is what we liked: The Spa area was fantastic: a full gym and locker room facilities for every guest which include steam, sauna, whirlpool, outdoor quiet jacuzzi, classes and tennis courts. I had a message and it was lovely. Our package included 30% off spa treatments, which was a good incentive. All the restaurants had very good food. Frank and Albert's, might have been our favorite. Lots of organic, fresh tasting food at very reasonable prices. Indoor and outdoor seating. We also ate at Wright's which was gorgeous and also very good. We thought the prices were not bad for the quality of the food and the ambiance. It was my husband's birthday so we splurged (our deal included $100 toward dinner and that paid for most of it, like I said, it was an unbelievable package). They even gave us a free souffle for dessert! The Villa was unbelievable, 1200 sf, 2 patios. We had reserved a premier king room with a balcony and view. I won't be able to afford a villa on my own ($1200/night) but it was so nice of them to upgrade us without us even asking. Shows the care of the staff in general. We just seemed to get stuff without asking, like they wanted us to have the best stay ever. There is a fantastic main pool with a FLW inspired slide. There are also other pools on the property. You have croquet and a large lawn chess set. There is lots of patio seating around the resort, a nice bar, a casual cafe, a pool bar and cafe. It is just a great place to sit and unwind. We wished we could have stayed another day. There also have plays and concerts. We had just missed Randy Newman and the night we were there they had productions of both Midsummer's Night Dream (outside) and The Importance of Being Ernest (inside). There was s'mores making for kids on Friday night and lots of activities to keep you happy, if that is your thing. We got the deal we did because their slow time is end of May through the summer when Phoenix gets hot. It was going up to 100 degrees when we were there, but it wasn't unpleasant and with the beautiful rooms to hang in, the pool to cool down in, and all this resort has to offer as far as service and design - it is all good. Phoenix was never on my radar (I don't like the desert heat), but we vowed to come back more often.

We spent 3 days on the property leaving only to take a tour of Taliesin West (Wright's home and current architectural school less than 20 miles away) and we were constantly discovering new wonderful aspects of the hotel. In addition to the main building, there are 8 pools (have to go back to swim in the rest of them!) 2 full service restaurants (don't miss the lobster bisque and souffle) and a cafe, an enormous spa, tennis courts, I could go on. Tours of the hotel are offered 3 times a week - don't miss if you can work it in to your schedule. The grounds are so extensive that despite the fact we were there on a very busy, booked weekend, it was easy to wander the grounds without seeing another person. Both restaurants were excellent, bartenders imaginative - it was the perfect, pampered weekend.

As it turned out there were also 3 other huge luncheon events at the Arizona Biltmore on that day. Needless to say, the traffic and the parking was a bit challenging so when our event ended I decided to take my partner for a glass of wine on the terrace and wait out the exiting crowds. We proceeded to the terrace, took a couple of very comfortable chairs and, while admiring the garden and fountain views, waited for our server. None came. After a bit I got up and went back into the hotel in search of a server. I found a young lady and asked if she could help me get a couple of drinks on the terrace. She informed me that the bar was closed so perhaps I could collect my partner and go to another \"open\" bar somewhere else in the hotel's interior. I was dismayed. The day was glorious and the very comfortable outdoor seating and views on the terrace are an imeasurably more \"luxurious\" experience than sitting in a dark interior bar. Bummer, I thought.... Another server happened to overhear us and turned to me and asked me what I wished. I responded \"two glasses of wine on the terrace\". To this he responded, \"I can make that happen!\" \"Really?\", I asked. \"Absolutely,\" he said and told me he would meet me and my partner back at the terrace. No sooner than I had taken my seat than he arrived and, after some dialogue and recommendations regarding the merits of various posssible wine selections, he took our order and disappeared back into the hotel. Soon we were sipping our wine and it was then that I noticed his name badge. \"Kevin,\" I asked, \"what is that pin you're wearing?\" Well, it turned out to be an \"Emplyee of the Month\" award. I asked Kevin if he could comment on its interesting design and he said it symbolizes the 16 Biltmore values -- which include his favorite value: Empowerment. \"This,\" he said, \"means I can take any action which I believe will enhance a guest's visit and I do not have to go through 5 layers of supervision do that. So, I can walk a few steps to bring you your drinks on the terrace\". Well, I was most impressed. Kevin could see that this customer could either acquiesce to the suggestion from the first server (and probably neither have nor remember an Arizona Biltmore \"experience\") or be granted my wish to enjoy with my partner a glass of wine on the terrace and celebrate the outdoor garden views on a beautiful Spring day.

There was no ice machine in our building and they wouldn't tell me where I could get ice...they said it would be easier for them to just bring it. And then I saw the charges.

The main pool is quite nice though and we did enjoy our time there. They advertise 8 pools but in reality there aren't 8 complexes of pools. The golf course (Biltmore Country Club) is essentially forgetable and not worth the high price. You can find much better courses and values away from the hotel.

This hotel has a lot of history and there are photos all over the walls of days gone by and famous people who have visited over the years. It was fun to check it out. The pools are great and the waterslide was a blast (even for adults). Bad: Our room was very small and in disrepair. I've posted photos so you can decide for yourself. Wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the furniture was beat up, there was mold all over the shower. In addition, the door that separated our room from our neighbors had a one inch gap underneath so you could hear just about everything in their room and I'm sure the same went for our neighbors. In other words, no privacy. Our room was right next to the main courtyard so lot's of traffic and noise at all hours. You were charged to self park your car which seemed a bit petty. Also, the service at the pool was very slow. We'd often order a drink and wait 15-20 minutes for it to arrive. They are either very short staffed or poorly managed in this department. When you are paying this kind of money for a room and for drinks this type of service is unacceptable. And finally, I left my phone in my golf cart after a round of golf at the Biltmore and when I went back to find my phone the indifference of the staff was insulting. I'm still perplexed at their response and lack of assistance. It was strange and extremely irritating. Overall, I'm glad we went to experience this little piece of history but I would not return.

I imagine when it gets really hot, those pools get packed, but since there are several of them spread out amongst the resort, I imagine there's always room at one of them. Ate and Frank & Albert's several times. Great for breakfast - not bad for dinner, but not amazing. The staff was all great. We were placed in the main building on the 4th floor above the lobby. Couldn't imagine it gets any better. See my pic for the amazing view out of our window. The room was large and spacious, although I might have preferred wireless access over the one wired port in the room. Plenty of electrical outlets. Depending on what was going on, we could actually get a wireless signal from the lobby - but it wasn't always reliable. I found the Starbucks on the premises to be a little expensive ($5 for a croissant?!) but with Hilton Silver Honors, you get a free large coffee each day of your stay. I think I could have stayed there a week, and I imagine it only gets better when the weather really heats up. Self parking was the only minor hassle. It was a bit of a ways away, but still a pleasant walk. Not much around the resort itself. A shopping mall isn't too far away, but you'd need to drive anywhere.

It was by far our best hotel of the trip, and was a wonderful way to start our vacation. When we arrived to Phoenix we rented a car and drove from the airport. The hotel is easy to find, and parking is abundant. We did get lost after we checked in because the front desk agent told us to park in a garage that was closer to our room, but something must have gotten lost in translation of the directions because after we parked we walked all the way back across the resort to find our room. We moved our car and the rest of the stay we parked right outside of our room! The first room we were given was under maintenance. After a long flight, and the aforementioned trek across the resort carrying all our luggage we were disappointed to be given a room that was out of service. The bathroom smelled of fumes, was being painted, and the bathroom was being caulked. We called the front desk and explained the issue. They brought a golf cart and took us to a new room, which was amazing! The room we ended up staying in was a one bedroom apartment style room with a full kitchen, living room, large bathroom with jet tub, and a porch. We loved having so much space to spread out and relax in. The place was perfect for a lounging couple! We used the main pool a few times (it was a little chilly out, so we didn't spend much time poolside), and we used the gym equipment each day. I got a massage at the spa, which was wonderful. The service at each place was top notch. The resort is conveniently located to just about anywhere you'd like to go in the Phoenix area. We spent time hiking, dining in Scottsdale, and gambling one night. It's not walkable to anything outside of the resort, but is driver friendly.

It goes without saying that the grounds, pools and buildings are beautiful. The main hotel has an elegance which most hotels simply do not have these days. It was the social aspect of the hotel which we enjoyed. People inlcuding the staff are very friendly. Having a drink in the lobby bar is something you need to experience for yourself. Everyone chats like they are old friends and you meet lots of guests. We stayed in a building beside the Octilla which was very nice. On the second part of our stay (we went to Sedona for 2 days) the hotel was full so we were given a room on the far east side of the grounds, opposite the main interior courtyard. Not as good, this building needs some cosmetic maintenace. I have to say the second room was much larger and nicer, however the common area (lobby) was not as nice and also not as convenient to the common areas. The kids loved the pool, pool slide, smores by the fire, chess and golf. The concierge arranged tickets to hockey games, Fiesta Bowl, Dude Ranch, restaurants and anything else we needed, they were great.

Whether that's worth the expense is up for debate. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. There was a decent work area and a view of the pool. There was an attempt at an outdoor patio / seating area but the execution was weak. It was basically two patio chairs looking at a pool fence. The bathroom had a large tub and a stand alone shower. The commode was in a separate, but very small, room. I'm not sure it would be great for a person who gets claustrophobic. The towels were clean and plentiful. The hotel itself had decent service. The valets were effective though didn't seem terribly efficient. The front desk staff was friendly but the place still had the feel of a convention center hotel. The gym area was nice and had lots of equipment. However, it closed early. Around 9 or 10. It's amazing how a Hilton Garden Inn can have a 24 hour workout space but a Hilton Waldorf Astoria Collection hotel has to boot you off the treadmill before the 10 o'clock news comes on. The spa was adequate but nothing to write home about. There were lots of parts that sorely needed maintenance. If you have a convention here, it's a great place to stay.

I'm not sure if it's because the property isn't making enough money due to the habitual overbuilding of resorts in Phoenix, or what, but to one degree or another the hotel has been partially updated from time to time but never given a good overhaul. For example, if you stay in the Garden rooms, expect to stay in a small room that was designed in the '20s and was kind of updated sometime in the '60's. A key feature is virtually no electrical outlets, small, New York City type bathrooms, and an ancient in room heating/AC unit. The Ocatilla wing has much nicer rooms but is a hike to anything on the property. Finally, I'm not sure who owns the Biltmore now but I've seen it be an independent, a Westin, and now under Hilton management. Sadly, Hilton properties have not impressed me with top notch housekeeping and that goes for my stay 1/11/11. My room was made up but dirty. There was crud on the carpet and the bathroom was, well, kinda clean. Now, on top of this, the Biltmore has adopted the new technique for having a much higher effective room rate than what is advertised. Some of you may have experienced this little wonder at other vacation type hotels and that is the \"resort charge\". At the Biltmore this was a relatively modest $28/day plus 13% Arizona tax, or $31.72/day. Now this is charged regardless of whether you use the pool or anything else. It's a scam. To hotel managements, just put it into the room rate in the first place and allow consumers to know what the real cost per day is. It's also $12/night for self parking which is in the boondocks. Now, to be fair, the Biltmore is a historic property with some very cool Frank Lloyd Wright architecture. On the other hand, for whatever reason, the owners over the years have never undertaken to truly renovate the property, not just change out a few carpets now and then or mess with the bar area. Too bad. And, as I mentioned, Hilton managed properties just don't seem to be on a par with Ritz-Carlton (Marriott), Four Seasons, or even Starwood properties. If you get a great deal, then by all means, consider the Biltmore. But, for what they usually charge, you can do better elsewhere, although, a final, final note, because of habitual overbuilding generally speaking the older the resort in Phoenix the less capital improvements. The Phoenician for example was an increible property when completed in 1988.

We had a large group and organized a group rate. It was to be a flat rate of $169 per room, including everything. First off, I had to ask for an itemized bill to be printed so I could see how the charges. They had charged us a $25 resort fee, $12 parking fee, $12 porter fee and a $3 housekeeping gratuity (How is a mandatory charge a gratuity?) each day. In spite of the fact that our account had a note saying it was supposed to be an all-inclusive price of $169 AND the fact that we didn't have a car AND the fact that we didn't use any porters, it was a fight to get the clerk to remove the extra fees. She said \"this is the agreement that the bride and groom signed with the hotel, so you have to pay it\". Maybe I'm a cheap jerk, but I'm not paying for services I didn't use.

Starting with check in, which went fine...that was until they gave us a very small map and pointed...turn here and here...needless to say we did get lost and had trouble finding the room. Why would such a nice place not have someone to take you to your room the first time? We had asked for a balcony room, however when we got to the room the balcony was \"attached\" to the room next door. With me being there so much by myself I did not want that. We contacted the front desk and had no problem getting the room changed to one with it's own balcony. Of course we had to go back and find the lobby and then find our second room. The room was very nice and had a great big bathroom. The Spa...it was fantastic! I had a massage and a facial. Both the treatments and the therapists were great. It is a wonderful Spa and I do recommend it. I took the \"Biltmore\" tour of the hotel which is free to guests, and it was really interesting. I would recommend it. You learn tons of interesting facts about the era and the hotel. We ate in both restaurants. Both were very good but extremely pricey. Now don't get me wrong we like a good dinner, but at Wrights it was $202.00 for the two of us! It was good but it was not that good. We eat at \"Ruth's Chris Steakhouse\" here at home and while it is expensive it would have been less than that and much better. I was really looking forward to the Biltmore, and it turned out to be nothing like I expected. I was very disappointed. I expected a relaxing resort environment. What I got was a \"convention\" site. There were multiple \"conventions\" every day. You can imagine very large groups of people talking loudly together, large \"gatherings\" in the middle of the grounds. It was really a bummer. I never felt like I was at a resort. They even turned regular rooms into meeting centers so no matter where you went you never felt you were in a \"relaxing\" environment.

Once inside I looked for the HHonors registration desk which the Hilton website said was there. If so, I could not find it. Later on I found I needed some additional toiletries and asked the Concierge for help. I was informed that I could take a taxi to a drug store (according the Concierge it probably would cost me $25 - $30 each way).

I come every year in October for business and pleasure. Let me begin with the positive. The grounds are always outstanding. The pools are comfortable and clean. The main restaurant is also pretty good. So that's the good stuff. I gather the Waldorf Astoria Company knows it is time to update the rooms at this property. Good chance they have not been since Marilynn Monroe was there as a regular. However, as a start they have created a boutique hotel within the hotel called \"Ocatilla\". It costs extra to stay there but you get updated rooms, continental breakfast and beer/wine in the afternoon. They also have a staff member within the building to help you. Sounds good, right? Well, it's not!! The rooms are nicely updated but lack more common amenities found in higher end properties. For example, TV in the bathroom, more than two towels in the bathroom, decent shampoo and conditioner. We actually ran out of shampoo and towels because they don't give you enough of either. The scale in the bathroom didn't work and neither did the TV remote in the bedroom. I mean, when you get right down to it, the room was about what you'd get at an average hotel... not high end \"boutique\" as they call it. But that's not the worst of it. They promote this higher end stay as having a free continental breakfast. It was about the worst I have seen. They had these tiny stale bagels that when toasted only got worse. The muffins were stale as well. The granola looked okay but they had no yogurt to mix it with... I guess just eating it dry is meant to match the dry Arizona weather. Kidding aside, I found the free breakfast just what you'd expect - you get what you pay for. But wait a minute, I thought I did pay for it with the mark up on the room. BTW, I did kindly complain to the staff person assigned to the Ocatilla and she promised to speak to her manager about at least providing yogurt but nothing changed while we were there.

Others colleagues were told to do the same. The clincher was when I had to sit in the West Foyer for four hours to direct delegates to the auxiliary registration desk.

I received a copy of one stating that there were either bugs in the upholstery or rugs and that the hotel is dirty and musty. In fact, the West Foyer smells like a sewer and the Main Foyer like a cow pasteur. I received a response similar to the person bitten by bedbugs that no evidence was found to substantiate my claim. In summary, with all the feral cats running around on the property, the hotel can continue to \"brush things under the rug\" but, eventually the truth/fleas will surface.", "Date": "September 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cClassic Arizona\u201d", "Author": "lariatlane", "ReviewID": "UR77365184", "Content": "We stayed here for a wedding in August.

Noticing AZ Biltmore had a special rate in the summer I opted to give it a try. After all, it's advertised as being part of the Waldorf-Astoria Collection. But based on my experience, the customer service at the front desk makes it more like a cheap motel. They must have cut back customer service training with the recent turn in the economy. They messed up my rate, but was not even apologetic. Mr. Gonzales at the front desk made me feel like I was begging for the special rate when it was clearly posted on the website as their AAA rate that night. I am a Diamond member (highest level) with their loyalty program and I was treated so poorly. I can't imagine how poor service could have been if I was just a walk-in guest w/o any loyalty affiliation. When I got to my room, there was an unsightly tray with left over food right outside my door. I called to ask them to remove it as I was expecting friends to visit. After 2.5 hrs and 3 calls later, they finally removed it.! I was already warned the resort is a bit dated, but I was willing to give it a try since most luxury collections tend to keep their structure up to date. On the negative side, the A/C is a bit old so it made a lot of noises. On the positive side, the maintenance man was able to quickly fix it. Seems like my quick 10 hr stay at the resort only amounted to me running into every back luck I can get here. I do want to comment the valet guys are really good and very accommodating. If I had to do it again, I would definitely go back to the Phoenician, Montelucia or the W Hotel Scottsdale. All 3 of them are staffed with well trained customer service personnel and there is no spottiness in terms of service from different areas of the resort. They know how to treat their guests as guests rather than a revenue headcount. Plus, they tend to give better upgrades to members of their loyalty program. Perhaps there are many positive aspects of this resort. But when customer service is poor, it's dififcult to recover from it. I wouldn't be surprised if the Waldorf Astoria downgrades them in the new future as this is not to par with their collection.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cIt's a lovely historic hotel with modern amenities in a good location and has a great staff.\u201d", "Author": "STinAZ", "ReviewID": "UR77284349", "Content": "My recent stay at the Biltmore was all that I expected from a 5-star hotel: large rooms with plush bedding, recreation for all age groups, good location, beautiful setting, and an entire staff that was professional and looked after all requests promptly!", "Date": "August 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Flagstaff, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful\u201d", "Author": "ThompsonCR", "ReviewID": "UR76739126", "Content": "My husband and I got married at the Biltmore in August.

During the hot Summer months we enjoy our weekend getaways at local first class resorts. We've stayed at the Royal Palms, the Four Seasons, etc. and have finally found \"our home away from home\" at the Arizona Biltmore. We recently decided to try The Arizona Biltmore because I had just become a Hilton Gold member and thus thought we would recieve special treatment. Upon check in I did learn of their parking charge of $12/night for guests. Shame on them. This is not NYC where space is at such a premium. That is the reason I did not give them an excellent rating on value. Other than that, our check in was most pleasant. Sara, who had just been with the property for 2 months, was a delight. We mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary and when we arrived to our room, Sara had arranged for a lovely dessert tray with a congratulatory note. What a nice welcome. Since we were in an Ocatilla room, we had access to the concierge, however, Sara was also at our service throughout the entire stay. We loved the pool, met some wonderful people from out of town, thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast at Frank and Alberts, took advantage of the fabulous room service, felt at home in our spacious room and just fell in love with the property. Funny, I assumed that all the attention we recieved was due to my \"gold membership\" status. Ironically, on the last day, I noticed that they had not in fact had me listed as a gold member (an admin issue which the hotel cleared up) and that this exceptional service was just the standard for the Biltmore. Upon check out, again with Sara, we booked another weekend for August. We are sold. We have found our favorite resort in the Phoenix area and it is the Arizona Biltmore. Of course the beauty of the place, the history and the location, all add to the ambiance of this property, but the people really made it something special for us. If you are traveling to Phoenix and are in search of the best hotel in the area, take it from a local, with first class taste. When we stay in Paris, we stay at the Ritz, Paris.

I have traveled the world over, more times than should be allowed in one life time. I have stayed at many wonderful and comfortable hotels, but never with the overwhelming satisfaction that I have experienced at the Arizona Biltmore. If there was ever a standard by which all other hotels and staff are to be judged against, well, this takes the cake! From the very moment I arrived on the grounds to the moment I left, I can honestly say that I have never felt more welcome and appreciated as a guest at a hotel in my entire life. I was a Captain for American Airlines for 26 years. Trust me. I know service when I see it. I kid you not. The hotel itself is amazing! It is steeped in such rich history and memories, that you literally feel the presence of such guests as Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., all US Presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to the Bushes. The movie \"White Christmas\" was written on the property. Not to mention the fact the the Hotel was designed under the influence of none other than Frank Lloyd Wright himself and his apprentice Albert. Which brings me to the real reason I have chosen to share my incredible experience with you. It is not really the hotel that I am writing about, but the incredible people who work there and make the Arizona Biltmore, not a mere hotel, but a home... Let me share some specifics. Ok, let's begin with Damien and Jason at \"Frank and Albert's.\" For anyone who has traveled alone, you will completely get what I am about to share. From the very instant I sat down at the bar to order dinner, I felt as welcome and comfortable as I would at my own house. Damien is quite simply amazing! This guy will achieve greatness. Trust me! He is a sharp wit, incredibly professional, and treats you as if you were the first and last patron he will ever see! Damien makes you feel welcome. What more can one ask? Then there is John Watson. John is the F and B Manager for Wright's Bar. John has his act together. I hope he won't mind, but I over heard him comment on the significance of plastic cups and the impact upon a hotel's bottom line. I was very taken by this. A hotel is a business. I was struck by his obvious savvy, but perhaps even more impressed with his temperament and attitude. One evening I was having dinner at the hotel's fine dining restaurant: \"Wright's.\" I was having dinner with the woman who is responsible for my coming to Phoenix in the first place. She is amazing!! But that is another story, and I'm presently allowing her to have the space necessary to figure her stuff out. Back to my glowing comments about John... So, two men were in the restaurant, and one of them was, shall we say: \"over served.\" Not by the restaurant, but by his own accord. Yes, we have all been there, and the movie \"Hang Over\" is more than familiar, but Crikey people! This guy was out of control! Now, I would have taken some primitive pleasure in causing significant bodily harm to this idiot, but cooler heads prevailed, as they are want to do, and the cooler head was none other than John Aris Watson. Let me simply say that he resolved the issue. This man rocks! Let's move to the pool bar. Christen is a young girl who serves at the Main Pool Bar. She is unusual, in that she is born and raised in Phoenix. Once again, we have another outstanding and positive personality embodied in this gem of a person! Need I say more? Which takes me to the Spa. Weary and stressed from travel, I sought refuge in the Spa. By the way, I didn't realize this during my first three days at this oasis from life in the desert, but Spa access is included in your room rate there in Nirvana! Yay! I have A.D.D. sorry. \"Flashy Silver Object look!\" HaHa... Where was I? Oh yes. The Spa. Well, upon arriving to enjoy a well earned massage, I asked the attendant at the Spa counter for help in contacting the Concierge for assistance in obtaining flowers to assist me in winning the heart of the forementioned perfect lady for me. There I go again! Shut it Joel! Lol! So, this young lady at the Spa is named \"Elissa?\" Not sure, but WOW!!! She stunned me too! Here's what happened: So, I want to order a floral arrangement to give to my future wife (Ooops!). Elissa over hears me struggling to order flowers and offers her assistance. Thank God! So, she asks what I'm looking for, and I tell her that the girl of my desire, mentioned she likes Lilly's. I live in Hawaii, I think flowers are amazing, but I wouldn't know a Lilly from a Frilly! Elissa says, when do you need them, I tell her, and just as my massage is finished, there is a knock on my changing door. The attendant tells me that there is a floral arrangement waiting for me at the Front Desk. Holy Toledo! Wow? They were amazing!!!! Did I say amazing again? Well, that's the Biltmore! Well, I have gone on too long, I'm obviously not a writer, and I am running out of attention span, but certainly not the accolades for the staff at the Biltmore that makes it not just a Hotel, but a true home away from home. (That was a run-on sentence. Darn!) If I was really rich? I'd move in tomorrow! Besides, then I'd be closer to that elusive butterfly I want to be my wife one day;) There I go again... Can't say I didn't warn ya!! Trust me. Go to the Arizona Biltmore. Stay a few days, then you, like me, will extend your visit. Again and again. Not kidding! It's that amazing. It will alter your vision of the world. Maybe you'll find your soul mate too! Relax, Play and Breathe! Joel Edwards Maui, Hawaii P.S.

The resort is very beautiful and the updates in the Ocatilla wing were very nice. The lounge is good, but the limited hours and small size given the number of rooms in the wing made it very crowded at times. This might seem like nitpicking, but the toilet paper in the rooms was subpar for a gas station, much less the club level of a luxury resort. I think that they are heading in the right direction with the addition of the Ocatilla wing, but they are still nowhere near Ritz-Carlton or related club levels. There was a small fireworks display on the 4th at the hotel that was excellent given the fact that the hotel was putting on the display. We thought this was an incredible touch and were very impressed. While the staff was very polite in general, the service in the Frank & Albert restaurant was poor. On our first night we ate in the restaurant and it was almost empty but it still took forever for the waitress to refill waters, clear plates, bring new cocktails, etc. The food service also was very slow from the kitchen end. Since we were there to enjoy ourselves it was not an issue and we did not think much of it at the time. On the evening of the 4th we went back to the restaurant. We wanted to make sure that we would not be late for the fireworks display so we ordered all of our food immediately upon seating. After 50 minutes we still had not received our 2 hamburgers. We understand that the restaurant was busy, but 50 minutes for hamburgers is a little crazy. We ended up having to get them boxed up to go so that we would not miss the fireworks. When we got to our room after the fireworks the buns were completely soaked in grease and not very appetizing. Also, others in our party had gone with the buffet. During the entire meal, not one plate was cleared off the table to the point of having a small stack in the middle. Also drinks were left not refilled for most of the meal. This problem was not the end of the world, but it is the service that really sets true luxury hotels apart from the rest and in this regard Arizona Biltmore fell short of the Waldorf Astoria name the Hilton has decided to attach to it. We have stayed at the New York Waldorf many times, always with incredible service and also stayed this year at the Orlando location. In my opinion, Hilton is doing those locations a disservice by invoking the Waldorf name in regard to this resort. That being said, I thought the resort was very good throughout and would consider staying there again, it is just not anywhere near the top of my list for the area and if going back I would plan on eating elsewhere if I had anything on my agenda after mealtime.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cCommunication\u201d", "Author": "JamesValona", "ReviewID": "UR69777314", "Content": "Everything was great with the exception of one incident: I had left my phone in a friends car who dropped it off the following day at 10am.

This was my first time and I stayed for a long weekend with my two sisters. We shared a large and spacious room in the Ocatilla Section of the hotel and it's well worth the extra money. The lounge there provides a delicious continental breakfast, a happy hour with unlimited drinks and hors d'ouevres and later after dinner cordials, coffee and desserts. This is such a great deal and the service was tops. I got a very low rate too since it's off season. The Ocatilla concierge gave us a great recommendation to a nearby authentic Mexican restaurant, they printed up my return boarding pass and delivered it to me at my table at breakfast. I was charmed by the Biltmore. The separate Ocatilla pool was almost empty, even on the weekend, the workout room was clean and not crowded, I had no waits to get on the equipment, plenty of ice and water and towels and the spa ladies locker room was great as well. We had a roll a way for one night and they didn't even charge for it, and even though we had valet parking each day, we were charged as if it was the self parking ($12 instead of $27). I was pleasantly surprised with the bill. I have no negatives about this hotel. The grounds were immaculate and so beautiful and sprawling. It's somewhat of a walk to Ocatilla from the main building, but not bad, you pass the shops and it's a nice stroll, but hot if you're in the sun. I was pleased to no end and found no signs of wear and tear and need for a refurbishment and I can attest that our room was cleaned daily!

The Biltmore is definitely last on my list. First off $28 resort which does not cover parking. Parking is $27 valet and $12 self park, so pretty much ridiculous! Additionally the fee doesn't cover much which is why I have no idea why they charge a resort fee. Besides internet services, the other options are pretty much included within the STANDARD room rate at the other resorts. And yes while the others may charge a resort fees, PARKING was included. The hotel is old and I stayed in the Ocatilla tower which suppose to be the newer section. If that's new, then I sure hate to see the old. While decent, they can't compare to the competition I stated aboved. Turn down service was awful, whereas they don't service your room just give you towels. No clean up or NOTHING. They were suppose to run bath water if you request it, never happened. Don't get wrong not running bath water is not gonna ruin my trip, just don't offer it if you aren't gong to actually do it. This is suppose to be included when you stay in this tower because again you pay more $$$$ to stay in the Ocatilla. One person though who was awesome is Jazmin with the Ocatilla Conceirge, she was very nice and extremely helpful. The Ocatilla pool is suppose to private and only for club guest. Pretty much open to anyone, so again why bother paying extra for this tower if the rules aren't enforced. The cabana rental I must say were nice if you do it during the week when they are half priced. Othwerwise, don't waist your money because you are paying double when the cabana is really only worth the mid-week price. Everything is pretty much really expensive at the resort which is to be expected, but the nickel and diming for what you get in the OLD hotel is why I would not recommend it to others. If I have to be nickel and dimed, then I'd rather stay at a newer resort with better amenities! There is no way I would pay regular price when housekeeping isn't up to part, $28 resorts fees, plus parking which is a mile away, rooms are very dated, and the daily activities they offer all hae fees attached! Forget it. Save your money and stay at the Phoenician or the others I listed. Lastly, the staff was very nice but that is to be expected for what you pay and they are just as nice at the other resorts. So again, Biltmore just doesn't cut it with the competition and for what they are charge. You can save yourself the headache and some money by staying a newer and nicer resort where they appreciate your business, and provide a GOOD expereince for what you pay.", "Date": "June 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson", "Title": "\u201cGreat customer service!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "gretta1122", "ReviewID": "UR67818606", "Content": "I have never been treated as awesome as the person who checked us in treated me!!!

We were told it was a sales room, and by giving it to us, it would be costing them sales. My husband asked that a manager call us, but that never happened. The rooms in the Ocatilla were nicer, much more modern. Again, NO SERVICE at the pool, except for 1 morning. Towels never picked up or replaced at the pool. All rooms are a long walk. Self parking has very few spaces. We have stayed at the Royal Palms, Phoenician, and Westin Kierland, and this hotel doesn't even compare. The Adobe Golf course was like a poor public course, no elevations, no trees, etc. Unfortunately, our conference is here again next year.

The hotel is an amazing historical treasure. I really enjoyed walking around and looking at all of the photos of the hotel through time.

If one wanted a chaise lounge by the pool, you had to be down there to \"claim\" it with a towel and book by 8am... This was a bit too much \"cruise ship\" lack of quality to me, not what one should expect at a Waldorf Astoria. The rooms were quite acceptable... I can understand where someone would say that they need to be re-done, however, they are truly appropriate for the time period in which the hotel was built. The decor (very Frank Lloyd Wright, straight line and plain) appears bland, however it is correct for the hotel design and period of acrchitecture. The grounds are AMAZING and kept to perfection. The bathroom was very nice with a rainfall showerhead. The linens were first class, triple sheeted, with high thread count cotton. The bathrobes were equally nice. Finally, the restaurant was wonderful (Wrights). This was one of the most imaginative dinners for a truly classic hotel. We enjoyed the Chef's Tasting Menu with the WIne Pairings and found both felt that it was one of the best \"hotel meals\" that we have ever had. The sunday brunch was equally nice. The bottom line is that the hotel is really a true slice of American history. The architecture is fabulous, the rooms are very nice, and the grounds are amazing.

The incidents of poor service are too numerous to describe. Although our travel agent made certain that we requested an accessible room, we were put in a worn down room in the middle of the property inaccessible by car. We were taken in a golf cart past the laundry, tennis courts, far away from any services, and brought up the freight elevator since the bellman thought it would be faster than me trying to hobble down the long hallway. We were told that another closer room with a view would cost an extra $175 per night. It took a lengthy negotiation to land in a villa closer to the main building. The room was small with filthy, ripped up carpeting, a small, extremely old television and the worst hotel bed I have slept on in ages. The notice indicates that there is turn-down service, however, you will never need to call for it, since the maid staff turn down the bed in the morning. That's right, they never make the bed up completely. The poor service was more than frowning faces everywhere who acted like they were doing you a big favor to change a bill, or show you to a table. Never before have I been completely blown off by a concierge who I tipped 20$ to make a reservation for me at a local restaurant, and a hair appointment. That's right. I requested that he call and leave a message with the info at our room, but he did not. I left my glasses at the beauty salon, and the operator refused to put me through to the salon directly. I was transferred to security but there was no voice mail, back to the operator 3 times. I tried calling the spa, explaining that I was disabled and had to ask if someone could walk over to the salon to locate my glasses. The spa agent said she would, but she also never returned my call. There was an endless phone que for anything: room service, salon, housekeeping, security, spa. Terrible. The hostess in Frank's restaurant was beyond rude and unhelpful, though the food was fabulous. I will say that the food at the Biltmore was consistently superb: Frank and Al(?), the Wright room, the Cafe, room service. Do go to enjoy the grounds and the meals at the Arizona Biltmore.. Not one person inquired about our stay, and the rooms had no hotel survey about the staff, grounds or service, as most do. No wonder. It is clear that the management really does not care. Terrible, terrible attitude throughout the hotel. One other note about parking. Guests have two parking options: 1) valet parking in the main hotel for over $24.00 per day (excluding tips), or 2) self parking for $12.00 per day.

The meal at Frank's was also disappointing; the service was great. They clearly had no systems in place.

We cut our 5 night stay to 4 nights and will never stay there again. We were promised the opportunity of an upgrade upon check-in which never happened. The clerk was indifferent at best. We had to call housekeeping two times for towels, there was never any ice, no turn down service, and had to ask for toiletries to be restocked. It was as if once we checked in we didn't exist. We were also promised complimentary goodies in our room upon check in--there was nothing. Also, be prepared for a hike to your room from the parking lot. It got worse one night when there was a wedding and valet parking \"reserved\" the majority of nearby parking spaces for themselves.

Tips : If you choose to park your car yourself, in the section to the left of the main entrance (where the condos and townhouses are located) you HAVE TO come back all around the main building and enter through the main entrance and lobby; we did not think of doing that, took the short cut through the pool section and went in by a side door...

When we got to the room we found that it overlooked the hotel laundry, a road and a fence (some people must have curious taste when it comes to views). When we complained to a different desk clerk, he took matters into his own hands and upgraded us to a lovely suite overlooking the Paradise pool. Similarly, the waiter who served us our first breakfast was especially accommodating, going over to the (more expensive) cafe to get us some food that was not presently available in the restaurant. The next morning our different waiter was so clueless and useless (how hard is it to bring over coffee and toast?) that we decided to eat outside the hotel after that (try the adjoining golf club restaurant -- it's much better and cheaper). Finally, there were several conventions in the hotel and it was very noisy and very crowded in the public spaces, which clashed with the natural beauty of the hotel and its grounds.

While the grounds and rooms were very nice - if a little confusing to navigate at first - what really turned us off was the front desk. The resort appeared to have been fully booked for the days that we were there - so upon checking in it was annoying (but understandable) that we had to leave our bags until 4pm when a room would be ready. The restaurant and catering staff were all fantastic and friendly. The bellman and activities people were helpful. We had issues in two places. First, our company provided us with a credit to use on the resort. When my girlfriend booked a massage she was told one price. When she went back the price had suddenly shot up by $15 with the explanation of \"oh, you have resort credit\" -- in other words don't worry about it... Secondly, and more importantly, within about 15 minutes of checking out my girlfriend couldn't find her iPhone and believed that she'd left it in the room. The front desk gave all sorts of hassles about assisting her with checking on this. Part of the explanation that they gave was that she wasn't on the room reservation (corporate). However I'd point out that this isn't the Motel Six in the middle of skid-row. The front desk staff should take ownership of this type of problem. Eventually after some pleading the front desk reluctantly called up to the floor we'd been staying on and asked if anyone had seen an iPhone. No dice. Believing that the phone must have been left on the bed my girlfriend again asked to go up and check. Nope. Next she asked to see a manager. That lit a fire under the front desk who suddenly decided to send a bellman up with her to check the room. When they got into the room the beds had been stripped (where she thought she'd set her white iPhone down and left it by mistake). Luckily the bellman took control of the situation and went out to find the maid. When the bellman returned with the maid he asked her if she'd found a phone while cleaning the room. I'll let you guess what the maid pulled from her pocked. It was the iPhone --- and worth noting that we'd all been calling it in an attempt to detect where it was by the ringer.

We're huge Frank Lloyd Wright fans, so staying in this Wright-inspired Arizona landmark made it all the more fun-- and impressive. The hotel offers free 90-minute history tours where you can learn lively and facts about the Biltmore during its early years. Our tour guide, Laura (who works in accounting) was terrific. We were lucky to stay in one of the cottages original to the hotel which, although 80 years old, were beautifully renovated, spacious, and absolutely charming. There are many other room options that seem equally appealing, including a stay in the original hotel with its magnificent architecture, decor, and appointments. Everywhere you look, there's something to feast your eyes on-- from the magnificent back-lit stained glass panel at the hotel entrance to the signature Biltmore blocks gracing every building.

I make gluten free @ home ALL the time and honestly, it is very easy to do without the nuts. Translation, they did not want to deal with it. I then asked WHY no one had bothered to tell us this as they had no problem taking my AMEX and they had my phone number. Tears swelled in my daughters eyes, as once again, she would be left out. I asked could they do \"safe\" rice crispy treats? \"Yes I was told\". Now, in the height of flu season here in AZ and cold season, you would think ( ha ha) that they would practice more cleaner food handling. For $25, you could buy plain old cookies and decorate yourself in a more clean environment. Everyone shared everything, it was quite disgusting actually. Kids licking their fingers and then grabbing the decorating things out of the community bowls that we all shared. Kinda makes you wonder how clean the kitchen is @ the resort, no? Back of my mind I am thinking $25 bucks down the drain, and these VERY expensive rice crispy treats are going in the trash. So, when we left our germ fest, I mean cookie decoration, we stopped @ Whole Foods. Now, when we left, my daughter was saying she was \"itchy\". Not so uncommon this time of year as it is the desert and dry. Upon our arrival @ the store ( 5 mins) she was covered and I mean covered in hives. Total allergic reaction to sometime @ the cookie extravaganza. Thank goodness we travel prepared. I immediately called the AZ Biltmore to complain and demand my AMEX be refunded. They treated it as no big deal. The manager could have cared less. Our Christmas Eve was totally ruined by a little girl being pretty sick. This could have all been prevented had they had been honest. The first person who called me basically admitted they dropped the ball and did not take proper precauctions even though I was told they did! Any parents traveling with kids with gluten issues or food allergies, I highly, highly recommend ANY Four Season. They have to date bend over backward to always make me and my daughter feel safe and enjoy their yummy food!", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cTwo star service at five star price\u201d", "Author": "stevem9999", "ReviewID": "UR52051458", "Content": "Service was poor, not what we expect from a Hilton Waldorf collection hotel.

The physical draw to this property is obviously compelling. Anyone who understands the background of this hotel, knows the architectural history and lore. Not only does the careful preservation of this unique aspect deliver - the unpretentious prestine flavour of the grounds creates an atmosphere that I have yet to experience at any other reseort - and I have been to over 50 resorts. The physical product remains consistent with the over physical nature of the property. Well, thought out attention to detail without the intensity. A few areas of wear and tear expose some cracks in the walking concrete paths around the resort. Probably a tough thing to keep up, but it is noticeable in comparison with the prestine feel of the grounds. I stayed at the \"hotel within the hotel\" - the Octatilla experience. For me, as an experienced traveller, this is worth the upgrade. The room design feels like a 500+ square room with the best bed in the hotel world. The sleek, slim TV wall mount, great desk working area, and plenty of storage all well designed to leave lots of floor space for a very open feeling room. The Octatilla bathroom contains his/her sinks with plenty of counter space (I did not travel with my wife, but I know she would have appreciated the counter space), nice soaker tub, complete with \"Zen\" bath salts and a separate stand up shower. To top off the physical ambience I was lucky enough to have my own small terrace. With 90 degree weather every day, the terrace was a great feature. The hallways were well lit and aesthetically pleasing - again without the intensity or the \"trying to hard\" element of say W hotels or some other resorts. The room product was very clean. The Octatilla comes with access to an executive lounge. The physical space here is once again well thought out and designed. A great blend of outside terrace seating (with standard tables and relaxing cushioned seating) mixes with inside board room tables, comfy living room sofas and also restaurant style seating. Two LCD panel TVs which help add to the atmosphere without the sense of intrusiveness. The lighting and decor makes me want to take a lesson in design! The lounge also has two computers and can be used for printing and boarding pass documentation. Octatilla also has a more private pool that literally sucked the stress right out of me. Day beds, regular loungers and Cabanas all available and easily accessible. Service- While the physical product is extremely compelling, the service experience what among the most genuine I have ever seen. Somehow the culture of this hotel transcends beyond the Waldorf Astoria expectation. The service staff seem genuinely happy to work there. The staff in the Octatilla executive lounge absolutely made my stay a memorable experience. They seemed genuinely interested in me and what I needed...again without a sense of intensity or insincerity. In fact, the day prior to my check out, they took the iniative to call my room and inquire what arrangements I required to better assist the departure process. The food offering at the executive lounge was quite substantial with a very healthy breakfast offering (important to me), and unique and creative evening hors doeuvres. They supplied some nuts and snacks in bowls throughout the lounge. The only thing I would suggest here is that I saw bare hands of other guests go into the bowls - yikes! The centre piece lounging area of the resort faces camelback mountain. The seating design and atmosphere set here was quite enjoyable. I had dinner here two nights. The ambience was unmatched with the firepit conversation areas and glow lighting. However, I would suggest offering a slightly more extended food offering in this area, although I appreciate that the intent is to have a lounge offering. The main pool was also quite stunning physically and I liked the layout. The daybed and casita rental appear tempting, but I didn't see any users. The food service staff was exceptional, but I also wish a slightly more extensive food offering was available. The main dining restaurant was closed, but looked quite interesting to eat it. The most pleasant surprise of this resort overall was the refined, unpretentious service matched with the unique but also unpretentious design and feel. I will bring my family back for the adventure experiences (hikes, mountain biking and lots of yoga). The fitness area is among the best I have seen for upscale resorts and clearly was not an afterthought. Free weights, lots of cardio and plenty of room in this well naturally lit facility made working out easy. One can also do some laps in one of the many pools. I am running out of room for more detail on the service package, but I will conclude by commenting on the location. Easy access from the airport, to sporting events and to some of the Scottsdale night life. I would return to this resort with my family, but I would also consider using some of the hotel's very unique and cool meeting space for business meetings.

Firstly it appeals to those wishing to stay in buildings of great architectural interest.The Arizona Biltmore is one of the few hotels influenced strongly by perhaps Americas greatest arhctitect, Frank Lloyd Wright.It is all a matter of personal taste I would guess .Some might see it as an example of brooding magnificence. Others that it looks rather like a tired old prison. Anyway it is impressive and is in an upmarket location.. But the hotel has to attract more than just a few architectural afficiandos. It must compete in the Phoneix area with some of the most modern and most luxurious hotels in the USA.So this Queen of the Desert has gone down market. During the week it hosts hordes of the badged - Course and Conference attendees. whose low corporate rates must be amply compensated by their high bar bills. And at week ends it goes f for parents who want to lose their kids at the week ends.It fills its pools with partying pubescents . And this all shows in staff attitudes. Our party checked in three times for three different rooms.Not once during these procedures were we addressed by name, or welcomed,or asked if we needed baggage assistance,or told we had a nice room or wished a pleasant stay etc. Clearly check in staff have to be efficient as they process the masses. But they seemed not to realise that the poor independent traveller who has no munificent corporation,IRS, or alimony provider to help pay their bills would welcome the occasional smile in recognition of the fact that he/she are also paying guests..We may not be very important for the hotels bottom line. But the staff need not make it quite so obvious. The room? Standard good sized Hilton fare. One table , two armchairs, two chest of drawers, flat screen TV, small fridge.very comfortable bed. Standard bathroom, no walk in shower,no separate WC. All a bit worn but all quite serviceable. Just not exceptional. Public rooms are again quite impressive as are the pools and gardens. But everything costs extra.No coffee machine in the room,Ice machines carefully hidden away where only the staff can find them.No free newspapers.Normal disgraceful resort charge of 28 dollars whether you use anything or not. Self Parking is permitted providing you pay 18 dollars for the privilege and are willing to walk the mile or two from your parking space to your room.

The Ocatilla Club in the former Arizona Wing offers a club lounge, continental breakfast, snacks, appetizers, cocktails and dessert as part of their package. Also, the deal included lunch and dinner at either Wright's or Frank and Albert's. Frank and Alberts occupies a beautiful new Frank Lloyd Wright inspired dining room that is New York hip and more casual than Wright's. Exec chef Todd Sicolo has done wonders. Everything from the food to the menu text to the plating has an architectural bent. The wait staff was unbelievably gracious and the new restaurant had only been open a handful of days. But it ran like a well oiled machine. Be sure to try: the duck fat poached French Fries (insanely good), Fallingwater cocktail (refreshing and sophisticated), the four flights of mini sundaes (a child's delight built for adults), the vanilla ice box cake, the fried chicken (amazingly moist), the Waldorf Salad (a great reinterpretation of the classic) and FAB pizza with a crispy semolina flour crust that brings to mind Nancy Silverton's pizza here in LA a Pizzeria Mozza. A great stay and wonderful service in an architectural masterwork. Pools for kids, cocktails for adults, golf and tennis nearby, privacy if you want it. The management now needs to work on the spa and gym to bring them up to the level of the restaurants, lobby and rehabbed rooms in the Ocatilla Club.

We have both stayed in many nice places (4 Seasons, Ritz etc) and we both agreed this hotel ranks right up there with any other place we have stayed. The room was beautiful- the grounds were PERFECT. You could walk around for hours just looking at the plants, cactus and flowers. If I have one thing to criticize it would be service at the pool. The pools are very nice- well kept up. The furniture could be nicer and they could have the towels in more locations. It was a little bit of a pain to get towels. Esp. true is you are not at the main pool and you want to take a swim after 5. We had to use towels from the room. One other thing. The gym area was great. Very nice. They also offer a lot of good classes and clinics. They are pretty pricey. Thought the hotel could have done a better job on pricing those. Service at the hotel was top notch. Everyone was very nice and helpful. We did eat at the new restaurant Frank and Alberts I think it is called. It was very, very good. We went for lunch. We started with sharing the tomato salad and then I had the fish tacos and my friend had a flat bread with figs and chicken. Prices were good considering you were at a hotel. Bill was under 40 for two entrees and an appetizer and everything was tasty. I went from staying here to the Phoenician for my business event. That hotel was nice but fairly formal.

My daughter and her boyfriend, both veteran fine dining establishment employees, were agast at both the quality of the food and the service.

The resort itself is full of nostalgia and history. The Frank Lloyd Wright architecture is amazing, and the lobby is beautiful. Many famous people have stayed at the resort in the past, but that must be its only selling point today. The room we stayed in was dirty and shabby. The lampshade was frayed, and there was a hunk of wood missing from the closet door. The bathroom had penmarks on the wood around the counter, and there were two different kinds of mildew on the tub grout (the black kind and the slimy pink kind). Ick. On the second day, we actually caught a SCORPION scurrying across the bathroom floor! We put a glass over it and informed the front desk, and were merely told, \"My apologies, I will have maintenance remove it.\" The rest of the stay was spent checking under our beds and in our sheets to make sure there weren't more hiding in our room. There were several pools available, and we spent most of our time in the smaller pools that were away from the main hubbub. The smaller pools were surrounded by broken and faded lounge chairs and had no towels available. They could also use a good scrubbing. The main pool could only be described as community pool meets spring break. There was lots of noise and commotion, small screaming children, and lots of younger couples and singles. It was definitely not an atmosphere conducive to rest and relaxation. Many of the frazzled lounge chairs that were scattered around the pool were reserved for those paying extra for the cabanas, though we only saw a few that were occupied. Towels were hard to find, and at least once we had to wait for them to be replenished. The actual service was the worst part of our stay. It was as if the employees had been instructed NOT to smile at anyone. Upon arrival, we were given a map to our room and a key. No instruction as to the amenities available, location of the pools, spa services available, etc. The first night, we headed to the bar and had to wait forever to be served. The second day, we ended up walking out because no one ever came to serve us (although employees walked back and forth past us several times). They looked busy, but a simple, \"I'll be right with you,\" would have been appreciated. We instead walked next door to the on-site cafe for 3 bottled sodas, 2 beers and a cookie for a total of $40. The employees were odd, with simple requests (extra towels, an extra hotel magazine, etc.) being met with looks ranging from confusion to utter annoyance. As for the area, it was difficult to get in and out of the resort to find restaurants or shopping, even with a GPS. We did find ourselves in a less than desirable part of town several times, and resorted to traveling back to the area in which we stayed at the beginning of our trip (Fairmont Scottsdale--Excellent Review!!). In conclusion, if you are younger and are looking for a place to hang out, but don't have high expectations with regards to service or cleanliness, this place may be acceptable. If you are an adult looking for a clean and comfortable place to relax and get away from it all, stay far, far away from this resort.", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "michigan", "Title": "\u201cWonderfull for the whole family, what a blast, did not want to leave!!\u201d", "Author": "atnaak", "ReviewID": "UR36273549", "Content": "My sister and I wanted to visit some where warm!

We had pre-booked a room in the Ocatilla Club block as this included access to the Concierge Lounge. The hotel takes a little time to adjust to as the architecture is rather unusual and greatly influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright. The block we were in (previously known as the Arizona block) had recently been refurbished and offered really superb accommodation. Everything was new and we had a large HD flat screen LCD TV in the room which was super. The Concierge Lounge was one of the highlights of our stay and Carolyn and her colleagues went out of their way to be friendly and helpful throughout our stay. (They even helped us check in online for our return flights to the UK and printed out our boarding cards as well!). We ate breakfast in the Lounge, could have tea, coffee, or soft drinks all day, complimentary beer and wine, pre-dinner snacks, and post-dinner dessert, all included in the room rate. We did have one meal in Wright's, the main restaurant, but this was a little disappointing for the price. (There are plenty of good local restaurants a short drive away). We were slightly upset that the pool at the Ocatilla was being renovated (and we had not been advised of this when we booked) but there were several other pools. The Paradise pool was the main pool and quite busy (towels only available here), the historic Catalina pool was fairly quiet, but we discovered the Saguaro pool which we had completely to ourselves for two whole afternoons. The hotel was celebrating it's 80th anniversary and we went on a fascinating (and free) historic tour of the hotel which lasted about 90 minutes. The AAA rate for the room which we had booked via the internet was $152 per night including the resort charge. With taxes we paid $170 per night, which we thought was excellent value considering all the extras we had through the Concierge Lounge. The booking stated that there was a daily charge of $12 for parking, but we were never charged this. This hotel was great and a little different from the normal chain type hotel accommodation. It is a great location and very well maintained.

There were screaming kids everywhere, and their obese moms drinking pina coladas. It was Ohio in the desert. Just an awful scene. That said, the buildings are very pretty. Frank Lloyd Wright did not design it, but one of his students did, and it is a very pleasant imitation. As others have said here, it is getting a little worn.

There are only three cons about this hotel and they pale in comparison to the pros. It is out in the middle of nowhere. It will cost you $80 to go anywhere.

However, once you left the main lodge things started to fall down. Our room while large and with a balcony was a little dingy and needing updating. Also the bathroom was tiny which I don't understand since there was plenty of room to expand into the sleeping room. Also the balcony was filthy. At a five star resort I expect everything to be clean including the balcony. The other thing you do get with an 80 year old hotel--thin walls and no water pressure. Lastly the hotel was at capacity that weekend and the facilities were not there to handle a capacity crowd. There were not enough pool chairs let alone room in the pool to move. If the hotel has a certain guest capacity then they should be able to provide all the guests the same level of service regardless of how many people show up. The hotel did not live up to its reputation for Luxury and elegance that I expected.

From check-in to about day 4 of our 7 day vacation our requests were generally answered with, \"I'm sorry this or that is for our Passover guests\". In particular I asked for a nicer roll-away bed for our son, but was told the full mattress types were for \"our Passover guests.\" When we couldn't find a spot to sit at by the main pool, all were \"saved\" by 9 am, I asked to rent a cabana, but they were rented well in advance by this large tour group. On day 4 I asked to meet with the Manager or director of operations, I did this by calling the manager's office to set up an appointment. The Manager of the Front Desk did meet with me and was a very wonderful person and managed to convey my problems to the director of operations, who then upgraded my two rooms to a two bedroom villa and gave us a cabana for our use, even though two days prior I was told they were all rented out. I felt that I made a reasonable request to meet with the Manager or Director of Operations, but neither were available, even though I told the assistant I could meet at anytime. When a guest asks politely to meet with a Manger I was surprise and dismayed at the lack of response.

When we arrived for our quiet first anniversary celebration, the first thing we see are masses of strollers and children running all about. Upon further observation, both visual and offered by the bellman, we were informed that the hotel becomes 90% occupied by the orthodox sect of Judaism at this time. For us, this meant incredible noise, children running everywhere, and worst of all, east coast manners of the parent clientele. Unbearable.........incessant cell phone usage, loud voices and general rudeness constantly.....There were no pools that were adult only and worst of all the children were often unsupervised and allowed to behave as they wished. Poolside, people would \"save\" chairs beginning at 9 am and then never sit in them until late afternoon if at all! There was also no towel service at the outlying pools unless calls were made. It was clear that management had either lost control or did not care to control the way people behave at their property. Certainly we wished we had been informed that a hotel we had believed would be a quiet romantic getaway had not been turned into a mass playground for hordes of children. I understand the sensitive nature of the foregoing and do not want the reader to feel we were being prejudiced, we are not. We are simply noting the behavior of what could have been ANY large group of people, not picking on one group in particular. I would not have wanted to share the hotel with 90% college aged spring breakers either. But I do feel it is incumbent upon management to somehow tastefully inquire as to the purpose of a person's visit and make sure it matches the ambiance the hotel provides.

I had stayed before and convinced my girlfriends to go to this hotel for race weekend. A few drawbacks on service: As a Hilton Gold member, I had made one of our two room reservations and requested two beds in our room. I called about both rooms 2 weeks before our check-in and asked to gaurantee two queen beds for each room. The front desk clerk told me, quite snippily, that he couldn't gaurantee it, but it shouldn't be a problem because over 2/3 of the property had two queen rooms. I explained that this was a requirement because all four of us were running long distances - he said, no problem. Imagine my surprise when we checked in, and I was told that there was only ONE room available for us (at 1:00) with two beds; all other double rooms on the property were sold out. Despite the fact that NOT all the rooms were checked in, and we were standing there, the front desk would not, initially, find us a room with two beds for our second grouping. As it turns out, they did go through, room by room, for all the reservations, and found a single guy who had asked for two queens - and they switched his reservation - again, they said, the only one left in the property. Bottom line: If you really, really have a bed preference, you MUST have status to ensure that you receive it. I will also add that we were in the Arizona wing. Our rooms were large, though not the largest on the property (the whole wing looks bad from the outside, but the bathroom was the size of my first apartment and the beds were extraordinary, plus we had a balcony with a great view of the mountains). We hit up the large pool by the spa the first day, but despite the fact that all the cabanas were empty, there wasn't a single lounge chair to be found. Tip: get to the pool early if you want a seat, OR go to the pool at the Arizona wing, which is empty all day. Finally, for dinner nearby, go to Chelsea's Kitchen or Postino's - great fresh food that makes your trip to Phoenix unique.

We were able to self park right in front of our room. We sat by the pool all afternoon. We choose to stay at the smaller catalina pool as the larger paradise pool was a bit crowded. The pool was clean, lovely and peaceful. The water temp was a bit too warm to be comfortable, more like a hot tub then a pool.

I know we\u2019re on a resort but do we have to feel like prisoners? Give us food choices, vending machines and soda machines too for heaven\u2019s sake. This place is sooooo overpriced and not worth the $200/night. The one day the housekeeper left our patio door WIDE open. Thank God our computer and valuables weren\u2019t stolen! I went to the salon to get a champagne pedicure, $80. It was nothing special nor what you\u2019d expect from a famous \u201cresort and spa.\u201d Very average service. I get more at my local salons, even a mimosa or glass of cheap champagne \u2013 nothing at the Biltmore spa though \u2013 just some iced tea.

We had already booked flights etc. so after much back and forth we were told they could relax the rules. We arrived, went to the villa. No cots. We were told two could sleep on the pull out couch.

After three nights of toughing it out the kids (who are not whiners) were exhausted from the inability to sleep on the unbelievably low quality sofa bed. They brought in the two cots.

When we checked in, the lobby was beautiful and the staff was very helpfull. I am a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright and could see his influence throughout the resort. The prices in the shops are high (almost 20.00 for sunscreen). So make sure you do not forget anything. The walk back to our room, showed us how lovely the grouds where. The statues were beautiful. When we got to the terrace building the pool was being refurbished. This would have upset me if There were not so many pools and if I was paying for off season. The room was amazing. We asked for two beds but the were all booked (they were refurbishing rooms as well). We instead got a large king bed in a room that fit a roll away for our daughter comfortably. The bathroom was huge! Separate bath and shower with a great showerhead. the minibar was also high priced but I usually eat so much on vacation that I do not need late night snacks. We went to the main pool once. Most of the chairs are taken up by cabanas. It is so hot in Pheonix that the cabanas are popular. The second time we went to the main pool there were no chairs available. It too was undergoing refurbishing and the slide was closed. This is one thing that I wish I knew beforehand for my daughter's sake. We found chairs at the next pool over that was just as nice.

BAD: The pathetic service starts upon arrival. The Valet/Bell Desk will not offer to help with your luggage. The Front Desk will give you keys that don't work, causing you to return to get keys that do. It'll be a 5 minute walk to your room in the summer 100+ degree temperatures. The clock radio will be broken. The coffee maker you request (there are none in the room) will be delivered with a used filter and coffee grounds in it. Housekeeping will wake you by banging on your door at 7:00 am and will call twice when you don't answer. The fitness center will start turning off the lights and the TVs 30 minutes before closing (8:30) even though you're working out.

The concierge service was incredibly helpful to me as well, booking an excursion for my family to Sedona, getting baseball tickets to the Diamondbacks game, providing directions to the hiking trails, and printing out our boarding passes. My only complaints, which are minor, are that the food and drinks in my opinion are overpriced, even for a high end resort. A bottle of corona for example was $7.50. A hamburger was $15.50. Also the resort has only two real restaurants on property which with over 700 rooms get very busy. To be fair, there is a small cafe with a take out menu as well as a limited menu available at the main pool bar. Of course there is always room service. In spite of these small complaints, I highly recommend this hotel and hope to stay there again soon!", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cNice But They Nickel & Dime You\u201d", "Author": "CharlotteHokie", "ReviewID": "UR15168549", "Content": "We stayed at the Arizona Biltmore for 4 nights in mid-April. The resort grounds are beautiful, but be warned that you\u2019ll likely do a lot of walking as it covers a lot of area. Overall it was a very nice place, but we probably won\u2019t stay there again. It\u2019s a little more costly than what we usually like to spend but we were treating ourselves. In addition to the daily room cost, they charge you a $25 daily resort fee and $10/day for self-parking ($24 for valet) and while we knew all this upfront, I believe hotels should include the resort fee in their prices instead of tacking them on after the fact. We had a great time at the main pool (Paradise Pool) and rented a cabana one of the days. We chose a \u201cClassic\u201d cabana which includes its own bathroom with shower, fridge, TV, table and chairs, ceiling fan and lounge chairs. It cost $150 for the day, which was lower than what I had been quoted, a nice treat. There is also a \u201cPremier\u201d cabana option which is $100 more- these are supposed to be on the sunny side of the pool while the Classic is in the shade. What we found was that ours was actually in the sun for a good part of the day so I was happy I didn\u2019t pay extra for the sun option. A few things we enjoyed: the grounds are beautiful and there are some fun lawn games offered for everyone including chess, checkers (the giant pieces- very fun), and croquet. There are several pools on the site and while we only used the Paradise Pool (the only one with a bar and caf\u00e9), the others also looked nice. Our room was very large with a large bathroom and a large flat screen TV (most channels were in HD). A few things we didn\u2019t enjoy: the last day we were there (Friday) they didn\u2019t clean our room until around 4pm. The other days they cleaned much earlier so I\u2019m not sure if it was b/c it was a weekend day and they were more fully booked. While the bathroom was large, there was no door on the toilet room so it was open to the rest of the bathroom and closet area. The TV did not face the bed. When we arrived, our ice bucket was filled with water. The last night, my husband\u2019s pillow reeked of sour milk as if it hadn\u2019t been cleaned. We self-parked our car and under the guidance from the front desk, we used the parking garage to keep our car out of the sun all day.

We live on the east coast so this was a nice getaway leaving the colder weather behind. To get a good overview of the history I would suggest you look at the overview at Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. We booked our trip using AMEX i.e. their Preferred Resort Program and the room rate we choose was $500 a night for a Mountain View but at check in we were upgraded at no charge to a Villa Suite which starts at around $1200! The suite we got is literally this suite you see on the Biltmore website under the link for accommodations. The picture is room 7200 and it looks exactly like this. Needless to say my wife and I were happy with the accommodations. The bed was heavenly, the closet space was huge. The bathroom was large with two sinks but the shower door is very flimsy. Also the bathroom has a deep tub but it was not a Jacuzzi. . As you can see by the picture on the website this room has a wonderful sitting area with a prefect view of the mountain and a full kitchen and dinning room table area. The outside patio is also very large with two lounge chairs and a separate table with chairs as well. All this overlooks the outside area where guests play lawn chess and checkers and of course an unobstructed view of the mountain. For lunch one day we ate a hamburgers around the pool i.e. the Cabana Club which was around forty dollars and luckily, our package had one lunch and three breakfast certificates included to use at The Biltmore Grill or The Caf\u00e9 all I think were thirty-two dollars in value each. For dinner at the resort we ate at Wright's i.e. high gourmet, meaning very expensive and not much food. We also stopped by the The Caf\u00e9 for two oversized cookies setting us back seven dollars. One evening we sat out near the fire pits over looking the fountain which was beautiful and had two gingerales also costing seven dollars. We also ate off property one night at Donovan's. They are ranked #2 in The Prime Time Top 10 USDA Prime Steakhouse in the United States. This was absolutely excellent! The steaks, Australian lobster tail, crab cakes are all outstanding and you can't go wrong. You can even call and they will schedule to pick you up and take you back to the hotel for free which is a nice touch when you don't have a car. The last night both my wife and I had the 80 minute Dream Makers Spa treatment i.e. two hundred thirty dollars each without the tip each. The treatment was good and they have over forty massage therapist on staff. However, the \"spa\" dressing/sauna area itself was in bad need of renovation, the carpet was dirty, small half lockers, three showers, even one of the two bathrooms was out of order. It was very small and a huge disappointment after reading the brochure stating 22,000 square feet , which must be their fitness center versus a spa area. Also, to wait for your treatment, wearing only your robe and slippers, you sat in a cramped communal gathering area. For the money it is not worth it until they upgrade their spa facility to be a real spa. We also choose to eat room service for dinner which was over one hundred twenty five dollars. The room service menu was inadequate and left you scratching your head trying to pick something good to eat that would be filling but not just a hamburger.

I also spent 2 full days in a cabana by the pool where the staff were attentive and lovely and I also had a terrific, relaxing massage at the spa one of the early evenings. Because I was there mid-week through the weekend, I noticed a huge difference in clientele. Mostly business men and women Wed-Fri and then families on the weekend.

Overall, we had no significant problems during the 24 hours of our stay. August is low season here but we didn't see a change in the level or quality of service we've come to expect from a Waldorf=Astoria hotel. It was 112 degrees when we arrived so we opted for valet parking ($24/day) rather than self-park ($8/day). The self-parking lots (one is covered, one is not) can be quite a walk depending on the location of your room. Check-in was quick and easy. Front desk staff were polite and formal but very helpful. The Biltmore consists of a series of separate buildings, villas and cottages accessible by meandering walkways. Some are covered, most are not. Finding our room in the Valley Wing meant wandering around and taking wrong turns in the heat because the map we were given at check-in was not helpful. Don't rely on the map, look for the small signs posted around the grounds directing you to different buildings. During low season, room rates are about 50% of high season rates. Our resort room wasn't worth more than low season rates, all very average - king bed, a couple of chairs and ottoman, desk, large closet, 42\" flat screen tv, a large patio with seating. Not much of a view. Furniture is Crafstman style and looked dated and carpet was worn. There are small signs of neglect - for example, one of our lampshades had a big rip in the fabric that was pretty obvious and we had a burned out lighbulb on the desk lamp. Bathroom had double sinks, an oversized tub and shower combo, lots of plush towels but very few hooks to hang anything on. Our room also had two very large bath robes to use. We had a good night's sleep on the comfy king bed. The A/C was quiet and kept the room cool. Walls are thin - we heard voices from a couple rooms down, a TV show, toilets flushing and showers running. We even heard someone's alarm clock go off early the next morning! No coffee maker or microwave. There's a small fridge with minibar items - $3.75 for Coke or bottled water, $3.25 for a Butterfinger candy bar. In other words, the usual high prices. About 30 minutes after arriving in our room, the kitchen delivered a small plate of 4 dessert samplers and two bottles of water compliments of the Biltmore for being Hhonors members. It was a nice little amenity. One of the pools was open pretty much all night. There are lounge chairs, tables and limited bar service. The Biltmore also has 24 hour kitchen staff in case you get the munchies at 2AM. We sat by the pool around 10PM when the temperature had dropped down to 100 degrees. No mosquitoes. We had a light breeze, friendly waitstaff. A few smokers were around but they were downwind of us. While the room we stayed in was quite average, the grounds are quite immaculate and beautiful with lots of grass, fountains, a giant chess set on the grass, the Biltmore \"sprites\" statuary and all that Frank Lloyd Wright inspired architecture. Inside in the public areas, it's almost like being in a museum. Take time to browse the hallway between the Bistro Grill and Wright's where you can see photos of the Biltmore in the early years and of the celebrities who stayed there. There are several small shops near the Cafe that we browsed through featuring high-end resort clothing, shoes, jewelry, and Biltmore souveniers. We didn't use any of the spa services. As beautiful as the grounds are, we wouldn't stay here again. Rooms are really just average and restaurant prices are quite high. The resort charges for every little thing.

The main buildings are \u201cFrank Lloyd Wright influenced\u201d designs (built in the late 20's, but Wright is not the architect of record - although he was associated with the project), the grounds are stunning and maintained meticulously, and the surrounding views are spectacular. I found desk, concierge, restaurant and poolside service alternately harried and aloof. My sense was that line staff were too few and lacked proper training, while managers were generally indifferent to routine operations and most interested in cashing in on added-charge, personalized service opportunities. Event and guest self-parking (traveler beware - this is an extra charge NOT noted when reservations are made!) is atrocious - long distances to lobby, meeting and lodging areas. The shuttle is too infrequent for the territory it has to cover. Vehicular traffic in the lobby and meeting areas is heavy at times, and pedestrian areas are not well marked nor protected. I chose not to entrust my vehicle to the valets after watching another guest's car being used to bulldoze speed bumps and potholes en route to the (very conveniently located) valet lot. Standard rooms are smallish for a resort setting and furnishings (also FLW-type craftsman designs) look dated, with visible wear and neglect. Ditto the bath plumbing and appointments - the sense is high-dollar, but aging. Beds were comfortable, with proper pillows and comforters, but the luxury effect was ruined by cheap, thin sheets. In-room dining is Holiday Inn standard, not resort-style by any means, with standard plastic trays littering the corridors. Our family ordered pizzas; they were expensive, soggy and delivered in the standard cardboard box. Used service items were not removed promptly (actually, not removed at all prior to our departure)! We settled our account at checkout, then were surprised with a late charge to our credit card for mini-fridge items we did not use. It took three phone calls to reach someone in the accounts department with authority to remove the charge - and this was done grudgingly and with implied disbelief. This is a beautiful, elegant but aging resort property trading on location, its \u201dWright-influenced\u201d architecture, and a reputation for service it may have deserved at one time, but does not merit now.

The hotel seemed to be extremely understaffed as we noticed the same servers working full shifts at the pool and then also at the property's restaurants and lounges at night. Service was terribly slow at all of the restaurants, we waited more than 30 minutes for our waiter to bring us our check one night. On another occassion, our server brought us our drinks and when we gave her exact change (including tip), she exclaimed \"you guys are my favorite customers because now I don't have to come back and check on you.\" We sat outside at this lounge for 5 more hours that night and she never did come back and ask us if we wanted another drink.

Sure the formal Four Season's or Ritz staff may be more proper and perfect ... is that what you want? I enjoyed the Biltmore for it's unique location, history, and FLR style.

I want a hotel that is unique to Arizona, not one that could be dropped in any city and look just at home. I agree that the room price is high. But seriously, the prices are high at any fabulous luxury hotel with location, location, location during peak season. Respectfully, I do have a point of comparison. I've stayed at the Phoenician (It's beautiful, but typical decor of any upscale hotel in the world), I've stayed at Camelback Inn (desert scape beautiful and quiet but not as grand as the lush Biltmore) and have visited many more of the Phoenix/Scottsdale area resorts. To me, the Biltmore grounds, pools, and room (I stayed in the main building with a mountain view) were very comfortable and nice. And, the bed was just as good as any Heavenly Bed. To me staying at the Biltmore was a special experience. Walking around Bilmore Estate Drive and viewing the lovely muli-million dollor homes was fun, hiking up to mountain top historic Wrigley Mansion was stunning (however in need of some repair), and soaking in the Arizona sun instead of Chicago Winter.... priceless.

A two or three at most. Overpriced to the nth degree. Do NOT believe good reviews about this place, really truly. I can't imagine why anybody would stay here at these prices. I am used to five star places and love that level of service. When in Phoenix, stay anywhere but here. PROS: The golf course was ok. The architecture of the main building is really interesting, especially at night. Worth a trip if your'e into that. However... The service on the links was awful. The architecture is not Frank Lloyd Wright, however. It's just inspried by him. Worse yet, everything except the lobby and the main common areas have been gutted beyond recognition, like by the worst common denominator 70s Hilton type mediocrity. The pools are nice, but badly updated. Even the rooms have tacky arts and crafts knock off fake furniture you'd see at an Embassy Suites. So if you want to stay here for the architecture, forget it. Stop by and have a drink at the bar, walk around for ten minutes, but stay somewhere else. They took the soul out of this 1929 resort. Having said that, if only the Four Seasons or somebody would restore it to look original 1929 and take over management, it could be a special place, like the many upscale mid-century places in Palm Srings. CONS: During my stay, a partial list: They mow the lawn at 7:30 am with really loud mowers. The tv stations didn't work. No internet in the room, and the business center charged $40 per hour!! EVERYTHING is overpriced as to be a joke!! The porno cost $15 per movie. Sheesh! The honor bar was higway robbery: The teeny little water bottle was $5. This is the desert for heaven's sake--no complimentary water?? The teeny little half coke bottle was $5.50. The thing of cashews, all 23 of them, cost $11. There are flourescent lights in the rooms. I love the environment and all, but flourescent lighting is the worst cheapskate thing in a nice hotel. The gifts shops had tacky tacky 1980 preppie stuff. The food was HORRIFIC. At the Grill, at the Wrights dining room--it's as if the cook saw a picture of a fancy restaurant in NYC or San Francisco, and made the food look like the picture, but the tastes are truly gruesome. Bad tomatoes, broken recipes. The shrimp was yellow, the fish and chips frozen. The staff do not respect the do not distirb signs--we're talking three or four knocks late at night kind of thing. The staff is rather ignorant--they mean well, but they don't have the hotel to back it up. This is really not a good place to spend money.

First, check-in was excruciatingly slow and though the reception employee was pleasant, she didn't seem to know what she was doing. I'd say we waited a full 10 minutes before she found us a room. When she showed us where the room was on a map, it looked really far away. When I asked for one closer, she said none was available, but she said that to compensate for the distance, she had given up one of the special, luxury rooms. She whispered that this room goes for $1,000.00 a night - HA! - what a joke that turned out to be. We had to walk outside to get to the room - as it did not connect with the main building. It was over 100 degrees outside and no bell hops were available to help us with our numerous suitcases. We were both sweating by the time - 15-20 minutes later - we got to the room. And the room was a joke - tiny, with poor decor. There was no way it was worth 1K per night let only $100. So, we trudged back to the reception desk, and I explained our dissatisfaction, esp. with the distance - and lo and behold - a room was suddenly available. It was still a bit of a walk, but manageable. The nightmare started on the second day when we discovered - very late at night - that our closet was flooded. All our clothes - those on the shelves and on the hangers were soaked. This was at midnight. The manager said he'd send someone to pick up our clothes and get them dried. I explained that my husband didn't have any clothes left at all since all of his had been in the closet. When we got our laundry back, several items were missing. I advised the front desk, and then a manager, who said he'd follow up and get back to me within 30 minutes. An hour later, I went to the front desk to see him, and he was chatting and joking with an employee. He hadn't even begun to do anything. I checked back another hour later, and he said he didn't know what had happened, but that he'd have the laundry manager call us in the morning. He explained that the manager got in at 6a.m. I advised him to NOT call our room before 9am. I even wrote a note to this effect to leave with the laundry manager. Well, guess what, we were awakened at 6:00 am. I was so furious. He had not found our clothes - he called just to tell me that they were still missing. In the end, our clothes were not recovered, and with no explanation as to why. On top of all this, everything was ridiculously overpriced. A can (not even a bottle) of Coke was $3.50., a stick of deodorant was $8.00. Room service was extortionate and the food at the deli and restaurant (another restaurant was closed for the duration of our stay) was mediocre at best. The service at the bar was very slow. The staff generally seemed inexperienced. The worst was the billing. Our bill at check-out was twice what it should have been. We had to delay our departure getting that settled. Much worse than that, many others in our group found excess, unexplained charges on their credit card bill - a dozen reported they were billed for additional amounts as recenlty as last week - almost 5 months after our stay!

You can tell that the place definitely had its moments of elite history, and while it may have truly been one of the most glamourous hotels back then, it shows its age in both good and bad ways. It's as if, as another reviewer noted, that management can't decide if it wants to embrace its past or evolve into some vision of a Las Vegas resort future. The lobby area is truly lovely, cozy and inviting, if a little schizo. There's clearly Asian influences, southwestern influences and, oddly enough, a sense of pacific northwest lodges here. That's the interior... the outside is a different story. The \"iconic element\" of this resort are the building tiles that cover everything (and I mean everything) all rendered in glorious greenish concrete. The property loves to drop Frank Lloyd Wright's name, and I can see the influence. That is, if FLW designed a hospital. It's very institutional and the buildings just look a bit like a very well maintained \"sanitarium\" from the 1920's. Luckily, the interior of my room was a different story. Very, very spacious and well-appointed. A few small gripes: - The desk chairs are not well padded. Sitting on them for more than 10 minutes will cause you some pain. - Their attempt at copying the \"dream beds\" of other hotels is merely a very large mattress topper placed on a cheap mattress and covered with very nice linens, which another reviewer noticed as well - The in-room safe uses a key. Get with it... time for an update. As for the grounds, if you can get past the concrete you'll notice how well maintained they are. Truly beautiful. I saw no notice of the mosquitos, cloudy pools and trash that other reviews make notice of. Simply put, they were immaculate. The service varied widely. Check-in and check out were efficient and everything they should be. However, once I got to my room a staff member was in the room making what appeared to be personal phone calls. She politely excused herself when I seemed to startle her upon pushing open the door. The bakery/cafe staff was indifferent and seemed \"bothered\" by having to serve patrons. The laundry service caused me some grief. I called very early and informed them I had some laundry to send out for same day return (promised back by 6pm). Come 6pm, no laundry. At 6:30, a call to housekeeping/laundry was met with a typical \"we'll check on it\" response. At 7:15 still no laundry, and a 2nd call got the the same \"we'll check on it\" and call you back response. At 8pm, a call to the manager on duty had my laundry to me within 10 minutes, delivered by a staff member who was clearly annoyed that I wasn't about to offer up a tip after waiting 2 hours for overdue laundry. Housekeeping also came very late-- in my case after 4pm. Dinner at Wright's was amazing. Our server, Wesley, gave nothing short of perfect service and made sure we had everything we needed without asking for it. His, and the somalier's, recommendations made for a truly esquisite experience. Highly recommended.

The other public areas of the hotel were also beautifully designed and kept and the spirit of the original design was totally intact.

The major complaint was when I was unexpectedly billed for bellman services that I didn't use and the comment was \"let me explain why we have this charge\". But, there were other areas where I saw a lack of attention to detail: a) Definitely the mosquitoes. I would expect that most visitors would not expect mosquitoes in the desert. Despite that, the hotel manager response was something along the lines of \"the property ground ponds are breeding areas for the mosquitoes\". On top of this, when there is a late afternoon/early evening lawn event, you'd think the hotel would have the forethought to provide repellent (esp if mosquitofish cannot survive the desert heat). b) In the spa, I asked the attendant if there were any hair bands. The response was that they were out. How is it that a spa at a Biltmore property could be out of hair bands? c) The ability to hear one another within the conference room was dreadful due to the air conditioner drone. d) Broadband access from within the room.

I arrived late in the evening and had a heck of a time just finding the elevators which were in a corner of the lobby and blended in with the rest of the concrete. Our room was on the second floor directly over the lobby where at all times of the day, people congregate on the couches and chairs, both inside and outside. From my room, I could hear people loudly talking and laughing from both sides of my room (with our door over the indoor lobby and our windows over the outdoor patio). Since I had to be up early the next morning, I called the front desk around midnight to have the people on the outside patio moved or perhaps quieted down since they were quite loud. Unfortunately, no one at the front desk bothered to answer the phone. The room itself was nice, although very small. It barely had enough room to fit the full size bed, which was very comfortable. Out of our window was a spectacular view of the parking lot. The bathroom was nothing to write home about, however, I did love the shampoo and lotion which smelled really good! Our door looked like it had been kicked open before, as the paint around the door was peeling badly and the frame was barely hanging on for dear life. One of my business colleagues was unable to get into her room one night, as the lock ceased to work and no one in the hotel could figure out how to get it open for several hours.

It was a few blocks away, which is a good hike in this heat. 3- We checked in around 7:30 pm, and the first room they gave us had no windows, no view, no patio and the A/C didn't work. They moved us to a similar room that at least had a sliding glass door and working A/C, but still no \"garden\" or mountain view- I had a view of the back of some shrubs. (By the way, we stayed in the \"cottages\"- my husband said it felt more like a cave). 4- The carpet was stained, some of the tiles in the bathroom were broken and cracked. The bed was obviously too hard because they put a pillow-top on it, which kept sliding off the side of the bed, with me on it. I had a terrible night's sleep, and the TV doesn't even have HBO! 5- The pools- this was probably the worst part of our stay. The pools were filthy- I mean, really nasty. The water was green and cloudy and greasy-looking. It was so hot I went in anyway. As I was swimming I pulled my hand out of the water, and there were long black hairs wrapped around it (NOT MINE!!) 6- The service at the pool bar was rude.

When we requested a late check out, the women at the front desk seemd unhappy and did not smile at all. The rooms were also a bit dissapointing. When our requested room (a king smoking) was not available, we were offered a double smoking with apatio. We were happy to take the upgrade but if we had paid for this we would have been VERY dissapointed. For one there was no privacy as you can walk from balcony to balcony. Also, our corner balcony was totally covered by trees and there was absolutely no view from it. The inconsistencies countinued into the quality of the property too. Though the main pool area was clean, it was WAY too crowded. The 2nd largest pool area was a much better choice and it offered a child pool and an adult pool in apeaceful setting. When we ventured out too see the smaller pools, we came across some slimey pools without any towels. They were NOT worth the search. The biggest rip off was the food. We ate there several times since we did not have a car and it was NOT worth the price. Don't eat there unless you HAVE too.

The problems started with the maid service after having no cream for my coffee on our first morning I wrote a note with tip for the maid to leave cream. I received only two packages of cream. The whole week I was without shampoo and Toilet paper at times and forever out of cream for my coffee. Nothing was being restocked in my room. The mantence department was called every day water coming from dishwasher to toilet over flow. The Spa employees are inexsperienced I had the worst massage ever.They made a big deal about my teenagers having a massage without me in the room even though they had on bathing suit's which ruined my daughter b-day since she chosed not to have a spa day.( We have booked her into a kids spa at our local resort back home.)My teenagers where with me when I booked the spa day their is no mistake they are under 18 no one told us the parent present rule nor 24 hour cancilation. I would have had to spend all day in the spa with my kids. My kids would be the first one from the room if some one started touching them threw there bathing suits they have had massages since they were 9 yrs old at kids spa in resorts all over the world. The next was the room service, 22% service charge means you get a tray put on the table and the waiter leaves for you to set up. No glass or ice for the soda's and the pizza where always under cooked. The food was terrible the Wright dining room was closed so we went to the Grill. the food was like it was reheated and dried out and small portions. The service at the pool was hit or miss.

The manager called me and offered a free night I declined I just wanted to leave. He offered a VIP treatment where someone comes after the maid to make sure you have everything you need like shampoo or TP. I asked why do I have to join a travel club to get special treatment. I'm not asking for special treatment just what I paid for. The staff needs to learn to great people and work on service.

Our room was clean and the bathroom was huge enough to handle three women, no problem. The beds are luscious, pillow top, down everything, crisp clean sheets. We headed to the Paradise Pool, there are eight pools on the property, as well as hot tubs. Knowing the history of the hotel I had visions of Old Hollywood Glamour. Unfortunately the Paradise Pool was more like Spring Break, very crowded, loud rock music playing and a bunch of TVs playing in the private cabanas that open up to the pool area. There is a bar a water slide. We hit the water slide and then headed over to the more serene Catlina Pool, that provided more of what I had expected. For dinner we checked in with the Concierge to ask about Southwest food in the area. HIs response was almost robotic and the directions to the restaraunt were already printed out on cards. We felt that the Hotel was probably getting kickbacks from the place so we asked the Valet guys instead and they were able to recommend some local, authentic places. The Valet guys were helpfull and friendly, I recommend talking to them. When we returned from dinner we had the great pleasure of finding a complimentary s'mores buffet set up around a camp fire with large Adirondack Chairs. There were sticks provided for the raosting and also multiple beverages. It was magical, the Hotel and grounds look particularly gorgeousl at night. A movie was being shown to kids above the pool so they could float and watch. The historical tour is only available on certain days of the week.

On this trip, my husband and I stayed in room 3115 from December 23 - 25, 2005. This was termed a \"Premier\" room and we had a special promotional rate of $299/night. We arrived at the Biltmore around 12:30pm, well before check-in time, to find our room ready and waiting. We were in the Valley Wing (built in 1979) which was immediately adjacent to the original, main building. Our room had a private porch area with 2 chairs, a table and a chaise longue. A hedgerow seperated us from the pool area (a lovely, smaller pool with Catalina tile, a fountain and a hot tub, more private than the large, main pool). The decor of the room was Craftsman in feel with some desert-color touches and leather and wood touches. Handsome, and plenty of storage for hanging and folded clothes. The King bed was very comfortable and the linens were soft. Bathroom products were present and accounted for, although nothing spectacular. The Biltmore Spa shampoo they provide smells great, though! The shower pressure was very strong and there is plenty of shelf space in the shower/bath to place razors, shave cream, toothpaste, etc., upon. Throughout our stay, the fireplaces were blazing in the public areas (even though it was sunny and 80 during the day, at night it got very chilly) and the holiday decorations were everywhere. This certainly added to the aesthetic charm of the place. We spent plenty of time by the very busy main pool. We enjoyed lunch on two ocassions at the poolside Cabana Cafe (thumbs up to the roasted peach and marinated shrimp salad and the spicy bloody Marys!) which, for two people, was in the $40 range. Waiters took care of bringing us pitchers of lemoned ice water and fresh towels...they were young guys, mostly, and not exactly heel-clicking perfect but sincere, efficient and friendly. Room service breakfast on Christmas morning was delivered at the stroke of the time we'd requested and was exactly as ordered (amazing how many places screw up scrambled egg WHITES and deliver the whole egg -- not the Biltmore, though!). We did not experience any of the \"hidden fees\" that some have complained of here -- everything was very clearly laid out on the forms at check-in and being very frequent travelers we are almost (almost...) used to the service/delivery/etc. fees that are tacked onto room service meals. We did not feel the prices for anything were out of line -- it costs $3 for a small bottle of club soda in the mini-bar and while it's no fun to pay that much, we've both stayed places where that price is easily doubled. The only complaint we had (if you can even call it that) is that this is the third Christmas visit we've made in 4 years and it would have been powerful to have heard a \"welcome back\" or even to have received a letter in the Fall asking if we planned to return. Although the resort is 75 years old and thus in some places shows cracks and crumbles (it's almost entirely made of formed concrete tiles, so no surprise there), at all times we both felt like we were in an incredibly special and unique place -- almost enchanted, with the ghosts of the famous people who preceded our stay all around us. The architecture, the friendly service, the happy families and couples as fellow guests, the sense that there was no other place on earth but \"here\"...all conspired to create a truly memorable holiday weekend for us. I can certainly say that we will return and hope to make a tradition of spending all our Christmases at this enchanted place.", "Date": "December 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cExtra costs and things not included\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4232275", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights, upon check in (after struggling to find anywhere that guides you where to park for registration, and eventually turning our keys over to valet to let them move it from where we temporarily parked), when we checked in we asked where to park and were told (in addition to room cost) valet is $21/night or onsite parking is $7/night IF you can find a spot, which our 2nd night we couldn't find a single spot in their small parking area (about 100 spots for about 800 rooms, you do the math) and ended up parking in the parking garage which is about a 10 minute walk from the room. Our room was in the Garden Villa and was a decent room. I wanted ice and read that ice could be delivered to our room (with service charge and tip no doubt). Before going to sleep my husband looked around for a coffee maker (is it just me or is a coffee maker pretty much standard in all hotel rooms these days?), he couldn't find one so he called the front desk and was told \"do you know how expensive those are sir?

So in the morning he went to the lobby to buy a coffee, Starbucks everywhere else would be $3.80 but here it was nearly $6.00 for one single cup. For the mark up I think they could afford coffee makers in the rooms. But oh well. The rooms were decent but no noise control at all and since we were near the main courtyard/fountain the people from the Holiday parties were filtering into the area at all hours of the night and it sounded like they were in the room with us.

Wait for half an hour for the car serivce, only ExecuCar are allowed to pick up hotel guest at the resort. 4. Additonal compulsory charges for Maid and Bellman services, either one is hardly provided.", "Date": "October 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, NV", "Title": "\u201cBest of the best in Phoenix!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4020804", "Content": "I have to say that our stay at the Biltmore was truly a wonderful experience! From the moment we walked through the front door till the moment we left, it was a delight for my family. The postings about it being a dreary place with bug problems is far from fact. The beautiful gardens (yes even in Aug!), the activities for the kids, the room and food were all top notch. The staff was all very attentive and every request we had was met in a matter of minutes. We travel quite a bit and stay in 4-5 star resorts each time and I say this is one of the best. Yes it is pricey, but no more than any other luxury resort.

You have to call if you want turn down service - something I have never heard of at all of the hotels I have stayed at around the world. We called one night and they never even showed up. There were no wash cloths in the bathroom, there was mold in the bathtub grout and the light next to the bed did not work. The jets in the hot tub near the spa didn't work and all of the pools and hot tubs had unsightly cosmetic problems. Service at the pool bar is terrible.

While the expansive grounds are fine and the room was nice, we have issue with how expensive everything costs here. The resort seems to see its guests as $$$ only; at least it felt like this to us. We ended up renting a car to go outside the resort to eat as the few hotel restaurants are terribly costly and portions were very small; we also bought foodstuff and water from the groceries. Mind you these shops and restaurants are all of 5 minutes away from the resort--provided you have a car! If you stay in the resort you will have to pay alot for bottled water from the gift shop and if you want fresh fruit be prepared to pay $7 for a fruit plate or $28 for a fruit basket. If your family members or friends wish to contact you by phone there is no toll-free phone number to the Biltmore. They must dial directly. Also the hotel charges a daily grounds fee and they are also charging a housekeeping fee of $3/day in addition! I can understand a grounds fee as that includes maintenance of the grounds and the pool area, but to be charged a housekeeping fee on top of this is too much. If we wish to leave a tip for the housekeepers that should be our choice. As for the staff they are mostly pleasant except we heard complaints from our relatives who called that the receptionists sounded bored and bothered when having to transfer them to our room. For a world-class resort that's supposedly a celebrity hangout, one would think that the receptionists would sound enthusiastic about working here and trying to upkeep the high standards of such a resort. I am sure we will not return to the Arizona Biltmore (aka Bilk-more).", "Date": "August 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201cVery good experience!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3685282", "Content": "I stayed here for one night on business in early June 2005.

I do tip well, but I do not like to be forced. And to have to tip 5 people for putting my luggage in the car. Food for my function was amazing. They did a nice job.
