At first I was very impressed with the room. We booked a standard room, and we got what I would call a jr suite with a living room and small kitchen area separated from the bedroom. This hotel is conveniently located near the highway but it is not at the center of everything so getting to San Juan is about a 20-30 min trip. I thought the hotel was very family friendly (even though it has a casino) and may be a good choice for families trying to get away from San Juan's busiest areas. I think the casino atmosphere was nice for those who enjoy that type of activity. The hotel had a few problems, as other have mentioned parking is a bit painful. The parking lot when we got in was very crowded and was difficult to find a spot. I think they should have some sort of designated area for guests. Other issues we had was the shower pressure seemed to oscillate and our shower head had a leak. The fitness center machines were lacking maintenance.

This time, looking for an option other than the San Juan and Isla Verde area, I decided to try the Four Points by Sheraton Caguas Real. Big mistake!! I arrived late at night and I had to park on the street. Security would not allow me to drive my rental car in the premises not even to check in and drop off my luggage, so I had to carry everything for about 1/8 of a mile on the street without sidewalk and no illumination at all. It was scary! Later on I heard that the casino visitors (not hotel guests) flooded the parking lot and often hotel guests have to park outside the facility. I thought, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I understand, not a big deal it will only be a parking issue and I will enjoy the rest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Wrong! When I checked in, they only had a handicap accessible room available. I was told to stay in that room, the next night they would honor my reservation with the room that I requested. When I went to the room, it was the most disgusting thing that I had ever seen. There was a chair bolted to the shower floor, old, rusty and disgusting. Skipped the shower that night. At least the bed was clean. Following night went to the front desk to exchange the room. I was thinking, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it is only a glitch and the second night will be better. Wrong again! The employee on duty told me that she was unaware of any request to change rooms but I could wait until the following night to get a different room. At that point I decided to check out and take my chances w/o reservations and go back to Isla Verde. The hotel employees were as friendly as they could. The casino looks like fun but staying there was too much hassle. There is a fairly high daily parking fee, a computer in the lobby that constitutes the business center.

Caguas is only about 30 minutes from the San Juan International Airport. The hotel has a casino, and entertainment on the premises. The staff at the hotel was truly exemplary. They were always kind and corteous, helpful with information, calling taxis, suggestions for activities, and always smiling! Caguas is a good alternative to the hectic scene in San Juan. There is a golf course nearby, and views of a small stream. The coquis (tree frogs) will sing you to sleep at night, and you can even see the stars. The restaurant on the premises is just adequate, but there are good eateries nearby, and taxi service is available for a very modest price. The Municipality of Caguas has an artesan's feast every Friday evening, with eateries, entertainment venues, and artesans at the Main Plaza until late into the evening. We had dinner at Raices, an eatery just a short taxi drive away, where we enjoyed mofongo (savory fried green plantains, mashed), and a thirst quenching pina colada in their signature tin cup. Raices is a restaurant chain (there is one in Old San Juan), and the establishment decor will take you back to Borinquen's roots. Nearby you can also explore the Guavate area, with numerous truly typical eateries, and artesans.

It was Saturday night and the place was alive. There was a live band (Latin music), tons of attractive PR women (too bad I'm married but the flirt was fun), and the table minimums were very low ($2 roulette). I quickly made some friends, played some games with comped drinks, and had an absolute blast. Only problem I had is at one point I opened a bar tab and when I went to retrieve my card someone had ran up my bill. The bartender had a hard time understanding my explanation (I don't speak Spanish) but someone quickly stepped in to translate. In the end, and without a fight, they took all the extra drinks off my tab and apologized. For being stuck in PR trying to get back home to St. Croix I had an absolute blast.

The Negatives: Since the hotel is constructing a casino, we were awakened to the sounds of hammering every morning at 7:15 a.m. We did request relocation to a quieter room, which was accommodated, but we could still hear the sounds of hammering. Since we woke up so early, the hotel should offer, at least, complimentary breakfast, but it did not. The cost of parking was too high $10.75 (including tax), especially since the hotel is located in what is really a pretty rural area. I wonder if they intend to discontinue the parking fee once the casino is opened, to compete with the dozens of other casinos all over Puerto Rico. Finally, the water pressure was inconsistent.

They will also charge to your room for your convenience though they are independent of the hotel. Checking in and out was fast and went smoothly, no line either time. I did check in at 8pm though Saturday and out 10am Monday. Not exactly rush hour. The bathroom fan did not work and right before checking out, we realized a water leak coming from upstairs, through the fan, dripping onto the floor. They did a nice job making the beds, and straightening the room when you are out. This was the best quality for the money if you don't mind a 40 minute drive into San Juan.", "Date": "March 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fayetteville, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cHome sweet home\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3251397", "Content": "I recently spent a night at the Four Points by Sheraton Caguas Real Hotel with my fiance. It is really a boost to the economy in the valley of Caguas. I am a native of Caguas and will be returnung home after my retirement from military service and will like to commend the Sheraton Corp for spearheading the developing of family environment hotels in the area. The facilities are very nice and the rooms are great. I did have a very special dinner with my fiance at The Paseo which is the restaurant located at the hotel. There was a trio there which performed a very special song for my significant other. They performed beutifully and were very corteous to my request. I cant wait to come back and take her there again for more days. Hopefully I can get the same room upgrade!", "Date": "March 4, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Four Points by Sheraton Caguas Real Hotel & Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g1066168-d534897-Reviews-Four_Points_by_Sheraton_Caguas_Real_Hotel_Suites-Caguas_Puerto_Rico.html", "Price": "$154 - $210*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">500 Alhambra en Granada Blvd.</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Caguas</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Caguas</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">00726</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Puerto Rico</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "534897", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9e/3f/9e3f3d9c6c05ab27e9e894b3a7ec7ffb1large.jpg"}}
