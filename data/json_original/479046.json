Fridge. US $90.00 for the five of us. Our youngest son (aged 12) slept on the bay window seat. Right on the Lagoon. Nice and quiet. Beautiful, quiet spot, handy to walk to shops and restaurants. Note: 'Paneeda Hotel' next door is not the same place. If you are looking for peace and quiet after the Kuta/Legian area, you won't want to leave this place. Restaurant is right on the Lagoon edge. Bikes provided for free by Hotel. Lovely bike riding around the Lagoon. Can't wait to go back. Might spend all of my next Bali holiday at this place! Lagoon clean. Our sons paddled out to the reef for a surf. Waves were small but okay. Breakfast was included. Quite adequate.", "Date": "Jan 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR473296380", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Kiwi1963"}, {"Content": "Little Jewel! My family and I stayed at the Peneeda View for three weeks in August and were very happy with the hotel, considering its low price. It's located on the beach right next to the Hyatt and the beach was just fine. Plenty of sand even at high tide. Low tide the entire beach along Sanur turns into a giant pond of sea grass, but we knew to expect that. The rooms were nicely done in Balinese style and the big canopy bed we had was very comfy. No bathtub in our cottage (only in family suites) but the bathroom was clean, plenty of space, and lots of room for clothes and luggage in the closets. All rooms have a mini-fridge which was great for keeping our beers in, which we bought at the market down the street. The air conditioner worked VERY well! All rooms have a little patio area and ours faced the beach/pool/restaurant but was still nice and quiet.  Staff was friendly, though breakfast service a little slow during the 9 a.m. rush. However, the breakfast was excellent value, as is most of the food offered in their small bale style (open air) restaurant which looks out over the beach. The pools were fine and usually plenty of loungers available.  Overall, our stay was super. The property is so pretty and the staff so friendly and helpful that one couldn't even get upset about the little things that went wrong, as they always do in any hotel... We stayed at the Hyatt during Christmas 2006 but, after staying at the Peneeda, we'd never stay anywhere else!", "Date": "Aug 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR431335761", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "KarenUAE"}, {"Content": "Great value for money Hotel Peneeda beach view is great value for money for a family holiday. We got a family room which consisted of 2 bed rooms  a large bathroom + outdoor shower area for USD 64 on the website hotels 68.com.They are local travel agents- not the most efficient  their exchange rate is not the best either. U could also contact the hotel directly  bargain for a good rate. The hotel is located right on the Sanur beach which has calm waters- not ideal for surfing, but has a range of water sports like jet skis, wind surfing, snorkelling, about 10 mins walk along the beach.The place is ideal for a quiet family holiday, not for surfing or a rockin night life. The road along Sanur has a range of lovely restaurants, u could stroll down  choose the one having live music for the nite.The breakfast at the hotel is adequate, tho my husband found the single sausage per person inadequate.We didn't eat any other meals there as we were out all day  dined at different places at nite, as the hotels offers no other entertainment- not even music in the lobby.We didn't use the swimming pools( why, when u're next to the ocean!), but other guests seemed to enjoy them, even at midnite!The rooms were done up in old wooden furniture, but lighting was dim.The abundant lizards had access to the toilet through the slatted doors, otherwise the place was well maintained  staff is polite.There is no need to book transport to hotel in advance, as pre paid taxis are available at the airport( the rates are fixed, pls do not bargain here) While leaving Bali, u need to pay a charge of about Rp 100,000. It would be a good idea to have that much of local currency kept ready to pay.For sight seeing  a ride back to the airport, u could hire Made's taxi from Enny's shop across the road. He is a good driver.Surfin  Shopping is good at Kuta, but the crowds, hawkers  taxi drivers can be annoying. U can get good wooden handicrafts from the many shops on the road from the volcano viewing, so save your souvenir buying for that. U can bargain for a good deal, but don't bargain too hard, these people struggle for a living.", "Date": "Aug 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR748175767", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "JeanDixon"}, {"Content": "What a lovely hotel!
