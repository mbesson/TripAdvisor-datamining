{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Okay Hotel The hotel is mildly average. The rooms seem a little faded and the beds are terribly hard. I found flushing the toilet incredibly hard and a little strange, as we had to wait 20 minutes before we were able to flush. Still, there were some good things. There was internet in the lobby and check-in was fast. It's quite a small hotel. If you want to come to Hong Kong, I would recommend staying in Kowloon or in the city of Hong Kong to feel the magic of HK. Unfortunately, the hotel wasn't in the magic of Hong Kong. I would recommend this hotel for people stopping by in HK or budget travelers.", "Date": "Jan 1, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR194683259", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "arthursiew"}, {"Content": "Nice hotel A nice, clean, relatively small hotel, and great for budget watchers. Not centrally located, but streetcar (tram) stops right out in front, and from there it's only 10 minutes or so to MTR (subway/rapid transit). Free internet access in the lobby is a plus. Rooms, at least those in the back, are pretty quiet.", "Date": "May 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR734981235", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "admybf"}, {"Content": "Good hotel The Cosco is a good standard, good value hotel in the western side of HK island. You can reach the centre, LKF and everywhere else quite easily on the tram for 12 pence (2 HK dollars), which takes about 10 minutes or so.They haven't replaced the door handles and the wardrobe door had come off, but really it was clean and professional.The toilet did not flush (I lifted the top off and did this myself), but two engineers were on site and there in minutes, very helpful.Nice firm beds, and free internet.This is the best value hotel I found anywhere in HK (I stayed in 4 while I was there for 17 days) and I would try to book this first when I return. Followed by the Jen and Pacific Island.", "Date": "Apr 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR900243296", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "LeeJP"}, {"Content": "A Fabulous week in HK I would like to to say that I had a fantastic week in Hong Kong with the aid of a Rough Guide to Hong Kong,  A really good value for money flight with Oasis Hong Kong Airlines (see web-site and links for Hotels) The airline couldn't do enough for me and upgraded me on the return flight. The economy was confortable and the the red hot deal fare at \u62e275 each way excluding taxes was a real bargain. I found Cosco Hotel , Kennedy Town on the web-links, which was \u62e2190 for 7 nights. It was a pleasant hotel only 20 mins by tram from central, therefore very conveniently situated. The room and bathroom were clean and confortable and the whole hotel was nicely decorated. The only negative was the bed was very hard! I would really recommend this airline and hotel if you are considering a trip to Hong Kong and don't want to spend loads of money.TOP TIP Buy yourself an Octopus Travel card at the airport , which gives you dicounted travel on Trams, buses, tubes, trains  Ferries.
