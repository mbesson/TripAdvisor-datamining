Location> hotel is located in Yenikapi it is walking distance to Aksaray, also walking distance from Grand Bazar but only for those who are good with orientation, since between hotel and Ordu Cadesi street in which is located hotel Grand Bazar, is a complex of small streets. hotel is not in so quiet neighborhood, since across the street there is a cargo company office which start working early in the morning, and workers make huge noise. Rooms> hotel has rooms which have window which looks inside the building, so basically there was no fresh air (at least not in my room) walls of the rooms where cowered with wallpapers which where used by some guests to express their inner artist (wallpapers where Scrabbled ) bathroom was small and not properly organized (i could not get out of a bath , although with 80 kg weight i could not consider myself obese ) Breakfast > very modest, 2 types of salami , 3 types of Jam, sausage, and sigara Borek pie. also there where some serials but milk which was there was rotten. (when i mention that to the waiter, he ignored me, when i used my body language to explain that to him he just told me to fu** off ... ) Staff> i noticed that staff working there is totally not motivated and exhausted, since some of them work for 15 h strait on several different positions, they are always in mess and are not so eager to help in any issue (bringing new towels, calling taxi, giving directions) some of them do not speak English (mostly Turkish and Russian are languages of choice) overall > will not definitely go there again, hotel is overpriced, no service, (and no pool which they advertise in web page)", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ashgabat, Turkmenistan", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel with Best Quality !!!\u201d", "Author": "Irina S", "ReviewID": "UR118104506", "Content": "Grand Emin Hotel is the Best Hotel with Best Quality of Service in Istanbul! It was my first visit to Turkey and I was very happy to stay in GRAND EMIN HOTEL where I felt as at my home!!! We had work meeting for a week and hotel's staff made everything for our comfort and good conditions of work. High-speed Wi-Fi is free. High class design rooms are large, very comfortable and absolutely clean with excellent beds, TV, fridge, air-conditioning and everything you need! The view from my window was at the old church and it was very charming! From the roof terrace and swimming pool you can see the beautiful part of Istanbul and the sea with many-colored boats dancing on the waves! Many shops and centers are in 5 min. of walking distance from the hotel (Laleli and Aksaray districts). Main city tourist attractions are in 15 minutes. The Hotel is 15 min away from Ataturk Airport and 5 min walking distance to the metro, bus, tram and subway station. For example: I easily found Grand Emin Hotel when I arrived to Istanbul and went with the printed map to the hotel by metro and tram. Heartfelt gratitude to the General Managers Erhan and Sabri Bey, and all staff of the hotel for friendliness and politeness!

Breakfast was absolutely terrible and it was exactly same for whole 7 days (it's probably always the same) and if you want to bring yourself a breakfast to your room they will charge you 5$. Bar is more closed then open and too expensive if you bumped to it when is actually open. Terrace was also closed for the whole time.

The room was rather small and the bathroom was very small and the bagnio was hard to get in and out of it, that was the most difficult thing we suffered through our stay, and during our stay the water was disconnected three times until we called the reception to fix it. We used the restaurant for breakfast since we booked bed & breakfast; the breakfast during our stay was rather good, so we can assume that the restaurant was rather good. We didn't know the price we paid for our stay since we booked through a travel agent (Al-Zajil & al-Mutahida in Baghdad & Blue Furat in Istanbul); therefore, I want other tourists to be aware from these travel agencies because they'll lose the money they'll pay and receive nothing in return, but I do recommend this hotel for persons who wish to stay for a short time and pay less money possible.", "Date": "August 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cValue for money\u201d", "Author": "Aussiesc", "ReviewID": "UR20266978", "Content": "This hotel was exactly what it said on the packet and was good value for the price we paid.

The bathrooms were very clean, the linen had obviously been freshly laundered and the room was secure. The staff spoke enough English for us to have no problems. The location of the hotel was really convienient to the Airport on the metro - no changes and only about 1/2 an hour. Also the tram into the old part of the city was quick, easy to find and cheap. If you are looking for a place to spend the night as you transit through Istanbul this is ideal (which is what we did) - cheaper and from what I have read cleaner than the hotels near the airport, but without the additional stress of having to get the whole way into the tourist heart of Istanbul. The area of town that it is in is a little off the tourist trail - but that made it more fun. We had a lovely meal in a cafe close by and you are close to the Bospherous if you want a nice evening walk.

While you are in Turkey be ready to have no paper in paid toilets, sometimes have [--] cofee for 3-5 dolars, etc.. This is ASIA. So, if you know this and are ready, you can stay here. We have had only one night in this hotel. While checking in at 13:30 we have realised uncleaned room with somebody's stuff left and messed & unremaked bed. Have explained the situation and were going for dinner. After the dinner room was okay, except there were no remote control for air condition avalaible, which was set to 14*C :) Have explained the situation at reception again and were given a remote control in 15 minutes. Next day we were checking out too late (at 14:00) without additional fee, so no complains about room - i think people before us have done the same. About security - we were leaving our bag in conference room twice (before and after check-in) without additional fee. Conference hall never was locked, there were a lot of other bags. Our group had no complains about missing things in bags. I think sometimes you have to trust more to the people. SO, it looks like staff was trying to do the best, just some bad overall management BUT VERY COMPROMISING for clients. We had a worse service, but have leaved our bags before/after check-in/out and had check out too late without additional fee. Shower had a crack and was leaking a little.

From the first time we set foot on to the hotel premises, we realised that we were duped into believing that this was a 3 star hotel. In reality this was far from that rating - I've seen hostels with better customer care and standards of luxury. However, in order for this review not to sound all negative, lets start with the positives: It'll keep the rain off your heads (providing it does during your stay). Average location, approx 20 mins by foot to Sultan Ahmet (main historical location of Istanbul) or take the near by tram at Aksaray. And thats it. Now for the negatives: Unbelievably poor customer service: The majority of the staff didn't speak English, which isn't the negative point in question, however, it did make it difficult to communicate with them when you had a problem, which we did, several in fact. The negative is that the staff were unnecessarily rude as they would ignore our questions/inquiries that over the course of our stay turned into complaints. Even trying to arrange a trip for the local sites around Istanbul or a cab service proved too difficult because of their unwillingness to help and to meet half way over the language barrier - we often found ourselves in this situation and so would go and arrange something with a nearby 4 star hotel whose staff spoke fluent English and had excellent customer service. Very poor security in an undesirable part of Istanbul: the hotel is located in Aksaray the Russian quarter of Istanbul, which the locals describe to be a \"dangerous\" place (this would obviously not be described on the hotel website and possibly not in guide books). By \"dangerous\" it is meant that theft, deceit (of the price of goods by proprietors of clubs, bars and restaurants) and prostitution were common place. Not knowing all of this we were still horrified to find that our hotel room door was very basic in terms of security - it was key and not swipe card operated with a single lock that you had to manually push into place every time you would leave the room. Coupled with the fact that the chain lock on the door had been broken off the door frame and the frame itself was damaged, we were duly unimpressed. This is something that we complained about to the management, asking several times for a new room but were given the option to have either equally unsafe rooms or just plainly ignored. Passports are also kept in a flimsy filing cabinet at reception right at the entrance of the hotel. Unhygienic Rooms: Two of our friends were located in a different room on a different floor, they complained that their room wasn't cleaned on a daily basis (there is no card to display outside your door if you don't want your room cleaned, in any case, you'd expect your room to be cleaned on a daily basis). In the room that I stayed in there were maggots, yes maggots, crawling on the carpet under the room's dressing table. Once again this was something that was complained about and just ignored. Bathrooms are very small and uncompromising with mildew forming in the showers. On a non-trip advisor scale this hotel would receive 0/5. Please for the sake of your sanity and in order for you to enjoy what truly is a memorable city in Turkey, look to book elsewhere for your hotel - remember, what you pay is what you get and this cannot be more true in this case for the Grand Emin Hotel.", "Date": "September 12, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Grand Emin Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d502354-Reviews-Grand_Emin_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$81 - $146*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Mustafa Kemal Pasa cad Fabrika sok 13</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Yenikapi</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "502354", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/7/2/6/7/257627/257627.jpg"}}
