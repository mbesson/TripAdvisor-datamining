The room was spacious and nicely appointed, with a modern feel to it. Plenty of space for my family of four. The only issue/warning I have for others is related to the thermostat. I'm a light sleeper, so prefer to set the room fan to \"on\" which provides white noise and minimizes the on/off cycling of the HVAC system. In most hotels, this means that the fan stays on but the compressor turns on or off to regulate the temperature. In this hotel, when you turn the fan to the on position that means that the air conditioner will run continuously. We woke up frozen, and while the thermostat was set to 69 degrees the room was actually at 59 degrees! Otherwise the hotel is fine, but I won't be coming back due to the meat-locker effect of the air conditioning.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, MO", "Title": "\u201cRecently refurbished quality hotel\u201d", "Author": "WebBrown", "ReviewID": "UR126178771", "Content": "The room appears to have been recently redone and are decorated very tastefully.

The hotel room has the feel of the newer, smaller, Residence Inns, but I found that the carpet, tile, and kitchen area to be very clean as well. The complimentary breakfast is well-stocked and features some different hot entries every day, as well as the regular staples. While the exercise room is quite small, (maximum capacity 10) it was equipped with two treadmiles, two eliptical machines, and two bikes. During my stay, I only encountered one other traveller in the exercise room.

First off, the the elevators just seemed smaller than the usual hotel, and at one point I had to wait 6 or 7 straight openings to get my cart onto one of them because they were slow and loaded with people. That was frustrating. And our tiny cart flipped with all the stuff we had to haul to have the kids there.

The Courtyard and Fairfield are only average in my opinion. There are a couple of restaurants you can walk to- East Pearl Chinese which is very good- also a Denny's and Tony Roma. There is a Bonefish Grill and Friday's across the main road. I recommend Miller's Pub, about a mile up Semoran Blvd- good local place, lots of draft beer and good seafood.

My husband and I booked this hotel as our last night before an early flight in the morning. Upon check-in, the lady at the desk indicated that we had cancelled our reservation. WHAT? Thankfully, I had printed off my confirmation e-mail before leaving home and showed it to the front desk. She looked puzzled, walked to another manager and talked discretely. They both came back up and told us we had been re-booked at the Renaissance just a few blocks away. We made sure we were to get free breakfast and all other amenities we originally were expecting. The manager indicated there was no hot tub (but thankfully she was wrong) They were polite and apologized. I am surprised how it was handled however. The front desk should be prepped with a list of \"bumped\" customers so that they look like they know what they are doing. I feel my reaction would have been different if I didn't have to prove I had a reservation. The Renaissance front desk was courteous but the changing of the guard proved to be upsetting as we had to keep calling to get charges removed..parking, internet and breakfast.

I understand it's fairly newly built. Close enough to the airport to catch a last minute flight on time, but air plane noise was not a problem at all. We managed to get a special reunion rate of $74/night! Everyone was impressed by how luxurious the rooms were for this class of hotel. We enjoyed 1-bdrm suites with either a king or 2-queen beds. Very nice decor, earthtone colors with woodgrain finishes all over. Lots of amenities were available: kitchen with stove, microwave, refrig, utensils, cookware, dinnerware, coffee maker, etc. The bathrooms were clean and well-kept. 32-in flatscreen tv's in both the bedroom and living area. The beds were quite comfy with plush pillows. Even the pullout sofa was enjoyed by the kiddies. The breakfast buffet hit the mark everyone morning. Eggs, sausage, potatoes, waffles, cereals, variety of breads, fruit, juices, and of course, coffee, milk and tea. My family loves to eat, so the buffet was a hit with everyone.

While the property had the usual Residence Inn amenities, it was hard to find. It is not on the main road and there are no signs directing you even when you get close. I literally blundered upon it after driving around for a few minutes. The entrance from the road is also somewhat hazardous (huge dip coming out of the parking lot onto the road). I scraped the bottom of my car on it almost every time I drove in or out (and I don't drive that fast). These are minor things compared to my inability to get a good night's sleep while staying at this hotel. My first problem was the bed. The soft padding they put on upscale mattresses makes these beds very soft and this was the softest hotel bed I have had in the past 2-3 years. I like to lay flat but it was just impossible in a bed like this. But that was far from the only problem. The air system switched on and off through the night but whenever it came on the sound was very loud. It's really not that hard to make these systems quiet. I've never had a problem like this before and I travel a lot. Then there was the smoke alarm system mounted high on the wall with the two flashing (mini-strobe) lights. They flash every seven seconds and are quite bright. Personally, I like dark rooms and these lights were a major problem for me. I'm not sure why they did this. I noted all the other hotels I stayed at on this trip either didn't have lights at all or had very dim ones that didn't flash. If it wasn't so high up, I would have taped something over them at night. I did leave a note for the cleaning crew but they simply took it off the wall and threw it in the trash. The security systems on my laptop prevented me from using the wireless internet, so I needed the hotel lobby computer (there were two) to get directions and print boarding passes. Unfortunately, these computers were monopolized by web surfers and game players (this was true at other hotels as well). In addition, one of the computer was down for about a day during my stay. I would like to see the hotel put some limits on usage time (for the benefit of all guests). The bottom line is that I found this to be a good hotel with a friendly and helpful staff.

This was a very special trip for our family, and it was made even more special by our stay at this hotel. It is perfect for families, seniors, business people, leisure travellers, and especially those with special needs. If we ever return to this area, we will definitely be staying at this hotel.", "Date": "May 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cbest beds in orlando\u201d", "Author": "laurathompson", "ReviewID": "UR29559215", "Content": "Nice clean comfortable rooms.

The Residence Inn was a perfect place to rest up from our long trip before the active days ahead of us. We caught the hotel shuttle from the airport; it was already there when we needed it so we didn't wait at all. The lady at the check-in desk was friendly and cheerful. We were all very pleased with our two bedroom suite; the rooms were quite comfortable and attractive, and we slept very well in the king and queen-sized beds. In the morning we enjoyed the included breakfast which consisted of eggs, sausage, waffles, muffins, bagels, cereal, yogurt, juice, coffee, etc. I was happy to see computers with complimentary internet access available in the lobby. I felt the management of the Residence Inn really thought of everything one would need for a comfortable stay, and provided it. Spacious, comfortable, well-appointed accomodations, friendly desk clerks, breakfast, internet access, prompt shuttle service -- it makes one wonder why some other hotels struggle with these basic things -- the Residence Inn makes it seem so easy. This hotel is an excellent value, in my opinion.", "Date": "May 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Muncie, IN", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "RC3KP", "ReviewID": "UR26931833", "Content": "we stayed here for one night on March 18, before we went on a Disney Cruise.
