Website looked great and previous reviews were glowing. Booked an apartment for 2 nights which although clean was very tired with no air conditioning. The room occupied by our friends although newer was uninspiring. The website led us to believe good food would be on offer but on our first night the menu was was fixed lasgane or roast beef and on the second night the restarant was closed!! Sold as agritourism the location was disconcertingly close to what resembeld a nuclear power station. OK for a stopover en route to the airport but not for much else.", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Casali Santa Brigida", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d563732-Reviews-Casali_Santa_Brigida-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$84 - $160*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Braccianese, Km 11.100</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Osteria Nuova</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00123</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "563732", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/7/1/2/3/103217/103217.jpg"}}
