The hotel was fairly easy to find but not in a very nice neighbourhood. I wouldn't stay around here again. Everything was fine when we checked in. When we went to our room I thought how considerate it was that they give you earplugs (I'm a very light sleeper and sleep with earplugs at the best of times). When I opened the curtains to look out the window - BAM, train tracks! Holy cow, no wonder they give you earplugs. The trains are so noisy, there is so many tracks. We just laughed, what else could we do! The room itself was fine really. Reasonably clean and enough room with a little bar fridge to keep our water cool. There was also a little Italian restaurant just down the road (I forget the road, but it's the main road between the hotel and the Pyramide train station), opposite side of the road to the train station. It doesn't have a sign out the front, but it's run by an Italian girl and her boyfriend and mother work there. It was excellent, we went back a second night. The food was beautiful and she gave us free dessert which was a speciality and absolutely delicious, and also a free glass of wine. She was so welcoming and friendly. I wouldn't stay in the area again, but it was okay for our first time to Rome. The trains were easy to navigate and get around the city to all the sights etc from the hotel.", "Date": "November 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, New York", "Title": "\u201cGood Value\u201d", "Author": "MBA722", "ReviewID": "UR61615478", "Content": "I found this hotel to be very accomodating.

I am SURE that you can find better hotels in Rome for that much under normal circumstances. It's very basic. Positives: - It's near the metro station. About a 10 euro cab ride from Campo Dei Fiori (where a lot of bars are). - The staff is really nice and helpful. - The beds are comfortable. - Yes, you open your window and you can see the train tracks, but the train noise actually didn't bother us that much. I can't imagine it would be a problem unless you stayed in the hotel during the day. They also give you earplugs. Negatives - - Not much of anything near the hotel. - ASK FOR A ROOM WITH A BATH. We got a \"shower\" room so there was a curtain and a drain in the floor, which, needless to say, means we had a flooded bathroom most of the time. - Our air conditioner made a lot of noise. - Mosquitoes (I think this would be a problem anywhere though) I mean, it was fine, I would say it was below average for a normal hotel, but it was definitely decent.", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norfolk, VA", "Title": "\u201cI've already booked my next stay\u201d", "Author": "adamsfam3", "ReviewID": "UR50223397", "Content": "My first experience with a European hotel and I was very pleased.
