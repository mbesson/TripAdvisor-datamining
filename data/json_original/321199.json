The hotel is located in a very quiet area, about 1,5 mile from historical center, and you can buy one-way bus tickets in reception. The clerk Graziella is very polite, as well employees from cleansing and breakfast. However, it\u9e93s not easy to find the hotel, even with a GPS and being in a 1-block street, because it\u9e93s very discrete. Clerk Marco M. treated us in an arrogant and unpolite way, because we left room card in reception by morning. Parking has only five places. Breakfast was very good.

Since I am travelling for business I appreciate the nice, clean and well supplied room (finally a hotel that has bright lights in the rooms and not a wake light of 40 Watts!) The bathroom has bathtube with hydromassage, hairdryer, a magnifier mirror with light (finally I can see exactly what I do during make up...) In the meantime I appreciate a quiet hotel, not noisy, not many people around..,.The room has TV, minibar and free ADSL conncetion. (you can get the cable with 10\u9227?at the reception,and the money is refund when you give back the cable).I had to go to the Fortezza (for exhibiton) so no time for walking...but in 5-10 minutes (it depends on the traffic) the exhibition center can be rached by taxi. Of course, you can also walk. The staff is extremely kind, helpful and friendly.I certainly will go back to Diana and I already booked my next stays in Firenze. I definitely would suggest this hotel.

We stayed at the Hotel Diana Park for three nights. The hotel was good value for money and the room was nice , however we were at least a 20 minute walk from the city center. The receptionist was rude and not very helpful or informative. Our room was downstairs and when you opened the door you were in reception. This made it a little noisy as we could hear phones ringing etc . Breakfast was nice, a good selection of cereals , fruit and breads to choose from. Word to the wise be prepared to queue for everything in Florence. It is a little crazy. I would recommend reserving your tickets bforehand.

I have just returned from the Diana Park Hotel - the room was lovely BUT BEWARE rooms 50 and 51 - they are on the ground floor and open out directly onto the reception/breakfast/bar area (50 is worse than 51), so you hear noise from the breakfast area and reception from very early each morning, and sometimes late if guests are having drinks. Even worse is the fact that both these rooms face directly onto Via Pascoli which experiences incessant heavy traffic day and night - and the window is about 2 metres away from all this - the noise is bad even with the shutters closed and the window shut. As a result, what was to have been a relaxing break turned into an exhausting sleep deprivation exercise - the hotel was fully booked, so there was no chance to change rooms either. So, my advice is specify a quiet room when booking. A minor annoyance is the fact that you frequently have to wait for a table at breakfast time - there are only a handful of tables for a much larger number of rooms!", "Date": "Sep 7, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR491436885", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "PhilLondonUK"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel I went to italy for a week and stayed 3 nights in this hotel when visiting florence.

Nevertheless, as the city hotels do, this hotel is situated in a noisy street. But the rooms at the back of the hotel are more quiet than the front-rooms (we stayed in room nr 105 at the back). The only disappointment was the small size of bath-tube. It was a really surprise, how can one move in it! But the others: furniture, decoration, air-conditioning, minibar, the buffet-breakfast, the kindness of the hotel staff maked our stay unforgettable.That makes the real difference: they have a private parking for cars (but it is advised to reserve it in advance, since there are only 8 parking places!).Getting to the old town is very easy due to the bus lines (25,12,1,7) which bring you to either to the Cathedral, or to the railway station.I would definitely recommend this hotel to others and stay there again.", "Date": "Aug 25, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR564794557", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "funtrip"}, {"Content": "Exceptional Staff We stayed here beginning of June and were pleasantly surprised at the value - the rooms were half the price of other 4 star hotels in Florence.

The staff here are the best I have ever come across in all of my travels and just couldn't do enough for you - they really make a difference.
