She is housed at the Residence Medaglie d'Oro and we were able to rent a 3 room apartment there for the week. The rates are very reasonable for anyone, but we got an extra discout because my daughter was there. We had a 3 room apartment for myself, my husband, my 13 year old son and my sister-in-law. The apartment was clean and comfortable with plenty of space. It had a small kitchenette so we could have some meals in the apartment. My only complaint was that they allow smoking and the previous tenant must have been a chain smoker. It took a couple of days of open windows to clear out the smell. The location is a little off the tourist track but very convenient. The Cipro metro station is a 5 minute walk and the metro is an easy way to get around. It is also a very easy 15 minute walk to the vatican. The staff is very nice and helpful. They lent us an outlet converter to use while we were there. The arranged for a car for us to get to the airport when we left. I would definitely recomend this place as an alternative to an expensive hotel. Much cheaper and alot more space.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cOnly stay here if you are in College\u201d", "Author": "AmericanNerd", "ReviewID": "UR89592320", "Content": "I came to this apartment/hotel for business and the whole time I was there the internet did not work and it was exceedingly noisy because a large quantity of the apartments are occupied by study abroad college students. When I asked about the internet situation I was told that the wifi failure was normal when the students were there because the system was overloaded. Essentially, it was like living in a college dorm without wifi. This is fine if you are staying for a short while or are a student, but if you are planning to do work during your time to Rome, AVOID. Also, when I arrived the cookware was filthy (caked on food that was never cleaned) and there was pubic hairs in my bed. I have stayed here twice and the first time was during late July. In late July there were no students, it was quite, and the internet was slow but usable. But after this experience, I will not stay here again.", "Date": "December 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh", "Title": "\u201cNice apartments, good location near Cipro station, market\u201d", "Author": "RayBuck007", "ReviewID": "UR71057330", "Content": "Stayed at Medaglie D'oro for 6 weeks, our apartment was airconditioned but don't expect that for all the rooms.

The Residence was wonderful. The apartments were spacious, clean and well-appointed. There is thorough cleaning service every day except Sunday, and linens and towels are changed weekly, as is usual in Italy. The staff are very friendly, helpful and courteous. The apartments are located in a nice residential neighborhood, with lots of shops and restaurants, just a short walk from the Cipro metro station and a fifteen minute walk from St. Peter's. Overall this was an excellent place to stay, and I can honestly say that I was a little sad to leave the Residence for different accommodations at the end of the program.", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Medaglie d'Oro", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d611778-Reviews-Medaglie_d_Oro-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$71 - $158*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Gualtiero Serafino 8</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Viale Medaglie d'oro 73</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00136</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "611778", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ab/7d/ab7d59cfdd83e4267ac6db5eece470e21large.jpg"}}
