The pricing seemed so reasonable for downtown Chicago that I wasn't expecting too much. What a pleasant surprise! This hotel is within easy walking distance from Union Station. It was after 10:00 p.m. on a weeknight and we felt completely safe on our short jaunt. I noticed several restaurants near Union Station. The hotel appears to have been recently remodeled, and everything was bright and clean. Our room had a nice-sized bathroom and ample space in the main room. They do not offer rollaways, and our sleeping arrangements put our 12-yr-old grandson on the floor using extra blankets, but this was our choice and the carpeting and baseboards were spotlessly clean and there was plenty of floorspace. I didn't notice street noise (but we do always travel with a whitenoise machine.) The free full breakfast was one of the best we've ever come upon -- very spacious seating area and 2 long bars with waffles, eggs, bacon, sausage, fruit, cereal, yogurt, etc. We didn't use the pool but checked it out - it was a small basic rectangular pool. The front desk staff was pleasant, professional and helpful. The next morning we chose to walk about 5 blocks to a bus stop after getting day passes at a nearby Walgreens. There was a stop closer, but rather than do a transfer we did a little walking.

We chose this hotel based on its location, price and that it had both a pool and complimentary full breakfast. A combination hard to find in the downtown. Checkin was quick and easy. Our room was very clean and updated. It was somewhat small but not cramped. Although we overlooked busy Franklin St from only 4 floors up the room was surprisingly quiet. The bathroom was spotless. The free wifi came in handy for looking up restaurants and attractions on our cell phones. The free full hot breakfast buffet was great with lots of selection, friendly staff and plenty of seating. My kids loved the fresh waffles. The front desk staff were very helpfull and accomodating when asked \"tourist\" questions. The pool was very small but still refreshing and came in handy as we were there during a brutal heat wave. My kids enjoyed there daily swims. The hotel is very conveniently located. We arrived by train and had a hard time flagging a cab. We ended up walking from Central Station with our luggage in tow as it was only a few blocks from the station. Even with luggage and two young girls it only took about 10 mins to walk to the hotel. It is just a couple blocks from the Willis Tower (Sears Tower). The hotel is also located right at the El train loop with one of the stations only a block away. This is were all the El train routes converge in a loop in downtown Chicago. From here you can get to just about anywhere in Chicago on the El. There are plenty of eateries, pubs, drug stores, coffee shops all within a short walk. As a side note we visited the Shedd Aquarium, Navy Pier for the weekly fireworks, Wrigley Field, the Silver Bean, Miracle Mile and the Skydeck at Willis Tower. All were very interesting and enjoyable. The kids especially loved the aquarium, a must if you have kids. We ate at the original Billy Goat Tavern (home of the SNL skit \"cheeseborger,cheeseborger) located below street level on the Miracle Mile and one of the Giordanos restaurants. The burgers at the Billy Goat are ok but the atmosphere is a must experience. The deep dish at Giordanos was unbelievable, a must try.

We live approximately 2-3 hours from Chicago and decided to travel to Chicago the night before so that we could get a good night's sleep. The meeting location was only 2 blocks from the hotel. Three of us were put in rooms 209, 213, 215, respectively...the fourth one (and the only male in the group) was put on the 9th floor. I was very pleased with the hotel in every aspect with the exception of one very glaring and unexcusable flaw...the flags they have mounted directly on the outside of the building where our rooms were located. There are four flags, each with a metal bar attached to the flag that kept the flag somewhat straight and likely prolongs the time it takes for the flags ends to become tattered and torn. However, between the rattling of the poles inside the metal piece that is mounted to the outside of the building and the banging of the metal bars against the building and flag pole, there was so much noise that it was impossible to get any sleep. I tried putting a pillow over my head and moving to the side of the bed that was furthest from the windows but nothing was sufficient to muffle the sound. As a result, none of the three of us staying on that floor got any sleep. This is going to sound like an exaggeration but, trust me, this is the most accurate description I could give it and the two other people staying in rooms down the hall from me agreed...it sounded like a snow plow blade scraping against pavement and attached to the snowplow being dragged along were metal garbage containers being violently banged together. What is most disappointing about this experience is that the clerk checking us in certainly knew there is an issue with the noise from the flags on that side of the building (the reason I have rated the service as poor). This was confirmed when we checked out and all we had to do was mention the flags and we got a sympathetic acknowledgment. We, unexpectedly, ended up needing to stay another night because our meeting ran long. However, we found a different hotel that wasn't as convenient as the location of LaQuinta just because we did not want to risk another sleepless night. Any aesthetic value LaQuinta believes the flags add to the curb appeal of their hotel does not outweigh the value of its guests having a restful sleep. I would only stay there again if the flags were gone or if I could guarantee a room no where near where the flags are located. Without the flag situation, I would have rated this hotel very highly. The rooms were $179 without taxes. This is not an unreasonable rate for a good experience but I have rated the value as low because it was too much to pay for a room that you cannot sleep in.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly Surprised!\u201d", "Author": "cheeseelizee", "ReviewID": "UR121963522", "Content": "I have to admit, I groaned when my Hotwire hotel was revealed.

Besides the king-sized bed we had a long desk under the window, a spacious shower with granite counters in the bathroom, a small closet, a huge dresser and of course a flat-screened HD tv. There was also a keurig-type coffee system! The entire hotel is new and the staff very friendly and helpful. The free breakfast on the second floor was one of the best I've seen... and really how many hotels in Chicago have complimentary breakfast?? They also offer free wifi throughout the hotel, not only free but very fast. We were impressed. They do have a small pool and small hot tub, could be a problem if the hotel were full and everyone wanted to swim. We were the only ones swimming the night we were there. We did not have a tub in our bathroom, not an issue for us but could be for someone with small children. Perhaps other rooms do have that option. It's hard to find a comfortable hotel within our budget in Chicago without compromising something, however at La Quinta we didn't have to compromise a thing!", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frederick, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cEverything was excellent and I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Chicago\u201d", "Author": "travelkitty50", "ReviewID": "UR117898441", "Content": "Staying here for one night the first week of September, we we were warmly greeted and upgraded to a suite without even asking, which was very nice.

Our room had two double beds, a flat screen TV, desk with office chair, large closet, and Keurig Coffee Maker. Our room also had a large bathroom with walk-in shower that made me think that we got a handicap accessible room. I very much liked the shower, although some might prefer a tub/shower combination. While the bathroom was oversized it kind of took away from the size of the living area in the room, but not to the point that the room was cramped. The hotel itself offered a large free breakfast with homemade waffles, cereal, eggs, sausage, and much more. Just note the breakfast bar closes down promptly at 9 on weekdays and on weekends it is very busy, due to all of the families that stay at the hotel then.

What we found to be most outstanding about our stay was the friendliness of the staff. They were cordial in all transactions; when rain appeared, they loaned us umbrellas; on Sunday morning there were no newspapers for sale at the hotel and the coin boxes were, perhaps frozen--wouldn't work. The afternoon bellman/porter Dave, offered to walk to a two block away pharmacy to get me a paper. He refused my offer of the $2 cost at which point I told him no. But an hour later, he came to our door and offered us his own copy of the paper which he had read before going on duty! The entire staff seemed pleased that we were visiting. The room (8th floor) was clean and quiet. I agree with a previous poster that privacy is to be had only with the blackout curtains, but there were seven lamps in the room and it seemed very bright. The weather was cold--but the room temp was comfortable. The room appointments were nice, although a second chair would have been useful--there was a sort of sofa however. The bed was extremely comfortable--firm and sujpportive but not rock hard. The bed coverings were folded back in an unsual way and we had to master making the best use of them. The bathroom was clean and bright--no tub (if you want a tub check with the desk, I think they may have some rooms with them, but not sure)--an easy walkin shower. Ample hot water and good towels. The wifi service was superior and it was free. We did not use the swimming pool or hottub nor did we use the laundry. As to breakfast, the current hours are 6 to 9 Weekdays and 7 to 10 Sundays. Hot scrambled eggs and bacon and sausage are on offer, plus three 'cook your own' waffle machines; hot oatmeal, three cold cereals, toast, English Muffins, bagels; juice and a mixed fresh fruit. We tried to arrive at least an hour before closing because in the final hour very little is replenished. Also, the hotel is clearly family-friendly and on the weekends after 9 it can get a little hectic. Sharing tables is ok--remember there are no strangers, just friends who have not met yet. But at closing time, the staff do clear things pdq. If you are late and need a food fix, there is a Dunkin Donuts shop about five doors east on Madison. OK, so the location is really good for the west side of the Loop, and not ideal for the near North Side or State street, but State is only five blocks east, and taxis and/or the CTA buses (buy passes at he Walgreen store 1 block east on Madison) will give you access to most everything. It wouldn't be a bad location for events at United Center.

Even the coffee was removed! To add insult to injury, they started turning out the lights a few minutes later. Curiously, the still-sizzling but quite emply bacon pan was not removed.

Now fast forward several months later, and the weekday price for this property is often higher than downtown hotels that understand the concept of \"service\". My most recent two trips were fraught with problems of being overbilled (at which point I had to be the one to present my original emails to prove the original rate - why is it always the CUSTOMER who has the onus of proof and has to do the work), and a housekeeping department that doesn't come on the days you need them to, but on the day of checkout when you supposedly have a late checkout \"in the system\" will barge right in regardless. Standing in the middle of dressing in the middle of my room, I would have nonetheless had the housekeeping SUPERVISOR (it would be almost excusable for a housekeeper, but absolutely inexcusable for the supervisor who is supposed to coordinate late checkout info with the front desk who's cleared it a day ahead of time) standing in front of me seeing me in my natural state had I not had the presence of mind based on countless previous experiences of exactly the same nature to put the bolt on the door every time I shut it. She tried to barge into my room after I had first had the general manager, Gary, tell me over 24 hours prior that a late checkout was ok. She tried to barge into my room after I had, secondly, looked the housekeeper in the hallway early in the day and said \"you do know I'm leaving at 2 (and held up two fingers for a visual just to make it complete), right?\" While I was looking through the gap in the door disbelieving that it was actually happening despite taking every step I could possibly take to assure it wouldn't, she told me that she just basically opens every door after noon whether there's a DND in it or not (the DND sign was in my door as well). So much for having a late checkout \"approved\" or \"in the system\". Not long after I heard one of the the housekeeping staff's radios uttering someone (a male on staff) saying \"so all she had to do was close the door - what's the problem?\" Clearly the staff of La Quinta thinks it's \"no problem\" to barge in a door while the occupant is very possibly not wearing a stitch of clothing, because despite the sign on the door saying \"do not disturb\", that's not \"disturbing\". What's the problem? Apparently Gary, the general manager, doesn't have one, as despite my MULTIPLE problems with the ongoing problems of this nature with his property, he's decided that his problem is the guest, not the property. Apparently he doesn't think that the entire mindset of \"so what\" on the part of his staff is all that important, despite the fact that there were over half a dozen true luxury hotels in the immediate vicinity charging less for a night's stay than the LQ - I stupidly chose to stay again out of some misguided \"loyalty\" and in thinking that a different manager's assurances on my last stay that next time \"their\" mistakes would be corrected meant something. Apparently the glaring mistakes made by the staff aren't the problem at all. It's that people who expect their room to be cleaned without hours passing by and multiple calls needing to be made, or people who expect to be charged what their CONFIRMATION emails stated to begin with, or people who expect \"late checkout\" to be something that actually means something other than getting barged in on EACH AND EVERY VISIT, not on a fluke or individual occasion, might actually have the audacity to stay at their hotel. He has the mindset of deciding a hotel guest is a \"chronic complainer\" without ever considering that maybe, just maybe, there are CHRONIC PROBLEMS. His words on the phone to me were that \"when a guest chronically has problems with the staff, eventually we decide enough is enough\" and mentioned that I was always negative with the staff. Was I negative when I very nicely asked about a late checkout the day before? Well, no actually you were pretty nice at that point. Okay then, was I negative when I looked at the housekeeper in the hallway and reminded them that I had a late checkout? Well, no, you were pretty nice then as well. Was I negative when despite doing all that the housekeeping supervisor tried to barge into my room anyway? Yes! See, that's the problem! We can't have people like you in our hotel being nice before a problem occurs and then not so nice after it happens! That's the mindset at this hotel. How dare people expect actual consistency from what one person on staff says to what another person on staff does (not a particularly big hotel or staff)? Can't have that. If you expect those kind of basics, stay somewhere else. I've logged many weeks cumulatively staying in this location. If you're a suburbanite who goes on very few trips and they're all of short duration, you might not notice any of these things because you're simply not in the hotel long enough to see them.

The closet had ample room and the bureau with the TV on it had 3 drawers and a cabinet with 2 shelves. The TV was great and had many channels to choose from. There was a 4 cup coffee pot, but no microwave or refrigerator. There was no \"hotel\" noise that interrupted our sleep, but since our room was located on the street side, there was city noise early in the morning on weekdays. Oddly, vending and ice machines were on every other floor, so we had vending (beverages only) on our floor, but had to go up or down 1 floor for ice. There was one snack, one beverage, and one icecream vending machine on the first floor. (Not sure if there were other snack machines elsewhere.) The business center was on the lower level and had 2 computers and a printer which came in handy to print tour information. The pool and hot tub were very small, but adequatedly served our purposes. Now to the only negative...which could be very frustrating: since we were in the business district, there were no restaurants open after about 6 p.m. in the immediate area and no hotel restaurant or room service. This was very frustrating on Saturday night, our first night in town. We had not had food on our flight and by the time we arrived at the hotel, weary and hungry, we didn't want to venture out by cab or public transportation. Thankfully, there is one Italian restaurant that is open 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. and delivers. So for $35 (including tip) we were able to have an overpriced meal of pizza and salad (no bevarages) delivered. The next night we had to do the same thing.

On Sunday, there was the usual LaQuinta make your own waffles as well as cereal, toast, bagels, fresh fruit pieces, juice and coffee.

It is basically a buffet style with all breakfast items including waffles, eggs, sausage, bread, fruit, juice, bagels, yogurt, cereal, etc. We even made PB&J sandwiches for the kids for lunch:) Free wireless internet was also a huge perk as we used this quite a bit to plan our days, check museum info, etc. I noticed that many of the other high-end hotels charge for this.

If you are going to Chicago and looking for a comfortable place while exploring the city, GO HERE. Another tip- if you are there to see the museums and have a museum/zoo membership to a local facility in your town, ask about museum reciprocity.

I've stayed there many times over the last few months. Check in usually goes fast and is friendly, except for one staff member who always seems to be put out to be having to do check in. All the other staff is wonderful. Rooms are modern and I personally love the fact that the showers are walk in with no tub, but I know that some people love hotel tubs. Desks are huge, which I really appreciate. Their is wired internet that is free and it has always worked. It is fairly slow access in the evenings, though. I've twice been assigned rooms which had no yet been cleaned -- they were still in the same shape as when the previous guest checked out. I've also found random items from previous guests in the fridges and in the bathrooms on more than half my stays. I find that sort of lack of detail a problem at the location and have mentioned it a couple of times to the front desk, but don't see much change. Speaking of cleaning, the maids here start cleaning rooms very early, even before 8AM. So be prepared and awake, as they are fairly assertive in wanting to get into your room, often waiting until you go for breakfast to swoop in. I have to leave the Do Not Disturb hang tag on my door for my entire stay to fend them off in the early hours. The breakfast is nicer that many \"free breakfast' hotels, but the staff there start blocking off access about 20 minutes prior to closing and stop filling food items shortly after, even upon request. You've been warned. Arrive early and finish eating about 30 minutes before the closing time. One great thing is that they supply soy milk, which I drink. A+ for that. The coffee in the breakfast area is undrinkable, but fortunately there is a Starbucks across the street and a cafe just off the lobby. This is one of the few hotels in its class that does not supply coffee/tea throughout the day. There is a coffee maker in the room, but they do not restock the coffee during your stay. There is no bottle opener in the room and only one for the whole hotel. So come prepared. One warning - most restaurants in this area close very early, some just after lunch/work hours. I tend to work late and struggle to find anything close by to eat after 7 PM. I hear that pizza delivery or 7-Eleven is your only choice within a few blocks. Finally, parking is expensive (as it is at all downtown hotels) and if you want in and out privileges, you have to park at the hotel garage next door. However, on check out day if you stay past noon, you have to pay for two days on that last day, which amounts to $65 for parking for that day.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGood for the price\u201d", "Author": "JessNcity", "ReviewID": "UR64088287", "Content": "Hotel is very clean and newly renovated.

It's been a while since we've been to Chicago and searching for a hotel in a good location and close to everything that we wanted to see and do during our short time in the city was a bit difficult at first. We finally decided to book this hotel due its proximity to the Opera House and also to Union Station. After staying at the hotel we highly recommend it for anyone traveling to Chicago, for business or pleasure. The hotel rooms look exactly like what is featured on La Quinta's website - they have been renovated and are very modern. The bathroom has hardwood flooring and a walk in shower (no tub) encased in glass. The room was a good size, not at all cramped. The beds were full size, no double queens available, but were clean and comfortable. The flat screen TV was nice but channels were limited, no HBO. The room we were in was on the Franklin street side and at night I did not notice any extreme street/city noise problems. The staff were friendly and on our check out day they let us store our bag in their luggage room while we went off shopping to Michigan Ave. The breakfast is pretty standard, not outstanding. It has the usual continental items - fruit, yogurt, cereal, milk, juice, coffee, muffins, breads & bagels, scrambled eggs, sausage & bacon and waffles. We did have to go up one floor to get ice and the business center is located on the lower level which was a little disconcerting. As far as restaurants around the hotel, it is connected to Argo Tea, there's a Starbucks across the street, there's also a restaurant called Pot Belly's across the street. There's also a cafe that's connected to the hotel but I can't remember the name of it. There's a Jimmy John's Deli and a Dunkin' Donuts around the corner. Unfortunately a lot of these places were closed after our event, which ended around 10 pm. We took a cab to Water Tower Place on Michigan Ave and the fare was around $10 not including a tip. We felt comfortable walking to the Civic Opera House and also to Union Station to catch our train home. The area is well populated during the day with business people and tourists alike. The one recommendation I can make is to improve the doors to the rooms. They looked like they were steel doors but they didn't feel as secure as I would have liked.

Overall, a good stay and I would not hesitate to return to this La Quinta.", "Date": "July 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "ff", "Title": "\u201cLa Quinta Chicago Downtown Money suckers.\u201d", "Author": "JKS2009", "ReviewID": "UR32148992", "Content": "I checked in this hotel late on 11:00 PM the usual check-in time is 3:00PM.When I checked in I have told the front desk that I will be checking out late which they made a note.I was told specifically that they charge for a night.Now when I see my credit card bills it seems they have charged for 2 nights.Now they are giving excuses that the late check-out cannot be so late (10:00 PM) at night.My question is they could have informed me earlier that I need to pay for an additional night.Infact I could have stayed an additional night.This is a trick to eat money as they have the credit card number to do anything.Never ever stay here.Be very cautious to stay in these type of hotels.Its better to give a penny to a beggar rather that to the money making attitude these hotels have.

I paid $113 which is excellent for a modern, good-sized room with breakfast in a very good location in downtown Chicago.
