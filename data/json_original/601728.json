The bathroom was clean and large, the shower had 3 settings, rain, hose and massage. I wasn't tall enough to utilise the massage option but the rain head was certainly very nice. The only problem with the rooms was ventiliation - we found it got very hot very quickly and there was no air conditioning unit in the room.

It was small but I have come to expect this from European hotel rooms of this class. - The location was quite central to the major sights, a 5 min walk to Puerta del Sol. - The hotel staff was generally helpful when we had questions. The negatives: - The room temperature was extremely warm which made it very uncomfortable. We had to open the windows and our door in order to cool the room down to an acceptable temperature. The hotel does not have air conditioning available this time of year (April) so if you turn the fan on using the thermostat in the room, it actually turns the heater on. Would be nice if the hotel had a note explaining this next to the thermostat so guests don\u2019t do this and end up learning the hard way. - It was very noisy at night until the early morning in the Plaza del Carmen which the hotel faces. Because it was so warm in our room, we had to leave the window open and there were people loitering and making a lot of noise outside our window from late at night until around 8 in the morning which made it difficult to sleep. - While a laptop was provided in the room, which was a nice touch, the mouse cover was missing (it was also missing from the laptop in the room my parents stayed in) so it made it extremely difficult to navigate the cursor with it and made the laptop essentially unusable. In summary, I wouldn\u2019t choose to stay here again, mainly due to the uncomfortable hotel room temperature.

The location is wonderful, hard to beat. You may go to almost every major attraction by foot. Besides, you will be among three major metro stations (Gran Via, Puerta del Sol and Callao) which makes it very easy to reach wherever you want to go.

The first obvious one is about the size of the room, very, very small indeed. It\u00b4s hard to store your clothes, to move around, to open the minibar, etc. But the worse thing is that they don\u00b4t turn on the air conditioning untill is summer outside, which is really bad, cause our room (409) has it\u00b4s window pointed to a very ugly part of the building and we would loose our privacy if kept it opened. So it gets really hot inside and there is nothing we could do about it. The mattress is also not that confortable, harder than usual.

Its location is hard to beat as it's on a small square between Grand Via metro station and Sol. There was some construction work going on in the square but this was not a problem whilst we were there. A street nearby is a bit of a red light district, with a few street ladies and sex shops dotted about, but it was pretty tame and there is a big police station in the middle of it. There are loads of restaurants and tapas bars around the hotel area catering for most budgets. Our room was on the third floor and although it faced onto the square the double glazing was really good at keeping out traffic noise, and noise from the cinema next door. The room was fairly small with two single beds pushed together as a double. The bathroom had a good, multi head shower, but one of the walls and door is made of frosted glass which does not give a lot of privacy from the bedroom. There was a flat screen tv in the room with lots of channels in Spanish, German and French, but only Sky news in English. We also found the room would be very hot when we returned in the late afternoon, and that the air con would not cool it down quickly. Most nights we would have to leave the balcony door open to cool the room whilst we went out. The room itself was very clean, nicely decorated, with large comfy beds. The reception has two laptops with free internet access for guests. The receptionists were all fluent english speakers and mainly friendly and informative. One big problem we had was that before we booked, the hotel website stated it had a free buffet breakfast. On arrival we found the hotel was charging 9euros, and were told that there was an error on the website. We paid the 9 euros each anyway and found that it was not bad value for a small but varied buffet where you could eat as much as you like. There are plenty of places nearby where you can get breakfast for 5 - 10 euros. The metro system was cheap, easy to use and clean. The 10 trip ticket for less than 7 euros was really good value.

Near the central shopping district. Clean, with a gigantic shower. There was construction going on in the plaza in front, so it wasn't a terribly attractive setting, but I assume that will change in the future. Service was friendly but not terribly responsive (our window wouldn't close completely and they never fixed it after being notified). My 20-something niece was thrilled because the room came with free internet access and a laptop. Some folks have complained about nearby prostitutes. We avoided the one street with a \"sex shop\" between the hotel and Puerto del Sol, and had no problems. Also, some restaurants nearby (Garbo, in the ground floor, and the vegetarian restaurant around the block to the west of the hotel) were excellent.", "Date": "July 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, very cool decor\u201d", "Author": "jaiyen08", "ReviewID": "UR8068222", "Content": "I stayed for 3 nights in June 2007. The location is fantastic, within walking distance of all the big sights and very close to the Metro. I was with 2 kids and ended up with a \"garret\" room on the top floor. You enter the room in a small vestibule, then climb a circular stair to the upper floor where the beds and bathroom are. Very modernistic decor, especially the bathroom - Jacuzzi tub, huge shower with water coming from all directions, etc. The room had a severely sloping roof and one is forced to stoop when walking around the bed. You will smack your head at some point. Room also came equipped with a laptop computer and high speed Internet. The only drawback was the aircon units. One night, the whole hotel had no A/C, the next night it was just my room.

The walk from Gran Via, the nearest metro station, is along a street of sex shops and prostitutes. This is, one quickly realises, not the tone for the entire area, because within a very short walking distance are the shops around Sol and the entertainment area of Chueca. The reception staff at the hotel were really helpful and friendly and, when we complained that the noise from the cinema next door was very loud, didn't hesitate to move us to a different (and even nicer) room. I would avoid getting a room at the end of the hotel abutting the cinema (room numbers ending with a 1), because the noise really is extreme. The rooms on the top floor (fourth) are really special, though. Both rooms were superbly equipped, with good, comfortable beds, flat-screen TVs, brilliant bathrooms and laptops with wi-fi internet and the decor is very tasteful and restful. The room we had on the top floor was split level; enter the room, ascend a spiral staircase and find a HUGE room with the attic beams exposed and an amazing bathroom (massive whirlpool bath, multi-directional shower, etc...) behind a frosted glass screen. One word of caution: the roof slopes down very low on one side, so if you're tall (as we both are), you can end up feeling a little like the hunchback of Notre Dame.", "Date": "September 16, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Petit Palace Plaza del Carmen", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d601728-Reviews-Petit_Palace_Plaza_del_Carmen-Madrid.html", "Price": "$112 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Plaza Del Carmen 4</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">(C/ Tres Cruces 2)</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28013</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "601728", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/19/f8/12/fachada.jpg"}}
