{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Perfect place to explore Tokyo and surrounds We stayed at the Akihabara Washington from 2/1/07 - 7/1/07 and it was excellent.Of course the rooms were smaller than what we were used to the semi double bed room that we booked turned out to be a very spacious queen size with a fair amount of room to walk around, place our 4 pieces of luggage and there was even a small dining table and a chair.The bathroom was all plastic and quite small but easy shared by two people and it kind of fit in with the vibe and nature of Akihabara.The room was on a non smoking floor as requested and it was between two fire exits so we had no noise or disturbances. from other rooms. But everyone is Japan was so polite that i don't think we would have been disturbed even if we were placed in a room next to occupants.In the room there was a lcd tv, mini bar fridge, a working table with adequate lighting, closet, mirror and the above mentioned dinning table and chair. Plus the window could be opened quite far so it was great looking from 8 levels up.The free internet was also great as we brought along a laptop but there is also some computer terminals set up in the lobby if you didn't bring one with you.Our bed and room was made and cleaned everyday and we rarely ever saw the cleaning staff. The were very efficient and fast, we left the room at 8am and when we came back at 10am to drop off some shopping our room was nice and clean again.The staff at reception knew enough English so that we could ask for anything we wanted and to converse to without any problems.Handing in the key everytime we went out was easy and great for us as we didn't want to carry it around or lose it. Then to get the key back all we had to do was show our ID or just repeat our names so it was all very simple.The breakfast buffet served was packed with many choices from rice, fish to more westernised dishes such as scrambled eggs and toast.Also the convenient store located under the hotel that was open 24/7 was full of everything we wanted and needed at anytime of day or night.On the last day we were in Akihabara we asked the hotel to mind our bags while we finished the last of our shopping and everything was simple and easy. They give you a tag which corresponds to your luggage which you hand back when you're ready to leave.All in all, a great place to stay within close distance to the major places and sights we wanted to visit Tokyo, Shibuya, Shinyuku and Harajuku.", "Date": "Jan 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR421464268", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "vostar"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066443-d598313-r6597009-Akihabara_Washington-Chiyoda_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "598313", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
