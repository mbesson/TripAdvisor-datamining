We called at 5:00PM to ensure there would be no problem with arriving late and were assured there would be no problem. When we did arrive, at 10:40PM, we had to ring the night bell even thought the sign stated the lobby was open until 11:00PM. When the clerk came out, he wore a t-shirt and boxer shorts to register us. My teen aged daughters were not amused and neither was I for that matter. The room was dirty and smelled musty. We went to the Wally World to buy room deodorizer before we could sleep in the room. When we got up for the \"Continental Breakfast\", we were directed to a guest room that had been gutted and tables were placed inside. The milk was warm and there were only 2 types of cereal to choose from. They did go to the trouble of buying donuts from the convenience store on the corner.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cCheap in price, but not in hospitality!\u201d", "Author": "Skowtko", "ReviewID": "UR138509510", "Content": "The owners are absolutely wonderful!

It\u2019s a great location and convenient to get too from the major city routes. Having plenty of restaurants and shows at walking distance made it easier for my husband and I not to drive everywhere. We had a nice size handicapped room. Also my son and his family shared the adjoining room. The staff is very pleasant and caring. They were always willing and provided great service. They also have a good breakfast set up. It\u2019s not the furniture that impressed us, it was the hospitality and the service. We will be coming back to this motel upon our return to Branson this Christmas.

Upon check in we immediately went to our room, upon opening the door we were taken a back by a bad smell and the carpet was very dirty and nasty. My husband walked in and stated \"we are not staying here\", before we exited the room my ten year old asked to use the restroom first. When I went to check it out I seen that there was dried blood droplets on the bathroom floor!! We promptly left the room and went to the front desk. When my husband explained that we had seen dried blood in the bathroom floor he was told \"We do a walk thru of our rooms so that is not possible\". They refused to refund our money even though not 20 minutes had passed since we checked in and paid. After being persistant they refunded one of two nights and we left. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!
