It is perfectly located in the centre of Barcelona. Walking distance nearly to everywhere. check in and check out was great, the female staff at reception was great, helpful and professional. However I did not get welcome drink as indicated in my booking. Everything is so modern in this little hotel. My room was definitely up to date particular the bath room. Room is tiny at least my room is. Tiny little desk, double bed and very small bathroom. It reminds me of HK or Japan. Breakfast starts 7 am, very nice breakfast and very quiet in early morning. Staff are usually friendly and helpful, except the male afternoon staff at reception. He seems always in a hurry. I don't understand why a 4 star hotel need to charge 2 Euro extra for using safe box. surely the hotel could include in the price of the room. There is no tea or coffee facilities in the room. I walked everywhere from the hotel. Another annoying thing is you can clearly hear your neighbour coughing, and people walk in and out of their rooms. There is a supermarket around the corner, if you need anything just out of hotel turn left, first street turn right. The supermarket on your left hand side.

We were told that it was convenient, for Placa Catalunya, and the Rambla. Before we left the UK, I e-mailed the hotel, requesting an early check-in, as having cruised before, at the end of the cruise, you are almost ' persona non grata ', i.e., they want you off the ship, asap. This being the case, I knew that we would arrive earlier than the normal check-in time. The reply, explained, that they would try to accommodate our request, but could not promise. On arrival at the hotel, at about 0945hrs, we were offered a room immediately, but as we had requested a room on a higher floor, we had the choice of waiting for this, or accepting a lower option. We decided to wait, and take the higher floor. We took one of the city tours, and returned at about 1300hrs, to find our room was ready. Our opinion was, that it was a very good city hotel bedroom. Very modern,clean and bright. The reception staff ( Jose ) was very helpful, ( although I think he forgot to offer us the complementary cava on arrival! ) . The breakfasts were very good, and again the staff were excellent, friendly and efficient. The location of the hotel, is very good. A short walk to the Placa Catalunya, where the city tours commence, but also where the airport bus terminates. As the Rambla, emanates from this Placa, this too was convenient. Regarding the value/cost, I cannot honestly rate, as it was part of our cruise holiday, and was not an addition, so do not know the price paid. However, I can without doubt recommend this hotel, for the staff, cleanliness and location. The hotel also has free computer/internet access.

Make sure you got to Park Guell to see the architecture. Breakfast at the hotel was good with a large choice of hot or cold food to choose from.

While the hotel is lovely and modern and very central, my main complaint is the way that we were dealt with by the staff. We checked in late on Friday evening and then headed out to meet friends. Upon returning to my room late Friday night/ early Satruday morning, I heard a kind of crackling noise, and when I switched on the bedside lamp, I discovered that my side of the room was completely covered with ants! I threw a towel down over them, and tried to convince myself it was fine, but then when I pulled the covers back I discovered that there were ants all over my bed! The room was perfectly clean, and there were no ants there when we checked in, and I'm still not sure where they came from but they were literally crawling all over the place. To be fair to the staff I dealt with that night, they were very polite, and sent a night porter up to assess the situation. He sprayed all the ants ( there were a lot!) with ant-killer, but the problem was that there were then dead ants all over the room, and in the bed, and also very strong fumes from the spray. The girl on reception told me that unfortunately the hotel was full up so they could not offer me another room, but they offered me a coffee instead and said that I could wait in reception until morning! At this stage it was very late/early, so my friend and I opted to stay in our friends adjoining room as we really needed to get some sleep and didn't fancy having to sit in reception for a few hours- we were only in Barcelona for 48 hours and wanted to get up and see the sights the next day. So, on our first night, in a 4 star hotel, we ended up sleeping 4 people to two single beds. I woke up having fallen through the crack in the middle the next morning,tired and uncomfortable. The problem arose when we went to check out. My friend had booked the hotel and the money had been deducted straight away from her card so we felt that she should speak to the guy on reception about it. We felt that we had paid for two twin rooms, but that seeing as one of these rooms was unsuitable for use on the Friday night, we should not have to pay full price for it. Furthermore, the four of us had a most uncomfortable night's sleep and no-one in the hotel ( apart from the girl I had initial dealings with) seemed to care less. There was no follow-up phone call or enquiry that everything was o.k, no note through the door, nothing. When we raised the issue with the guy on reception he was quite rude and irate and told us that on no account would we be getting a discount, that they had rang our friend's room at 7.30 a.m on the Saturday morning to tell me that my room was being cleaned and that we hadn't answered ( because we were asleep and didn't hear the phone), and also that because I had come in late on Friday night/ Saturday morning that I wouldn't have made full use of the room anyway. I argued that this was completely irrelevant- A-It was none of his business what time I came home at, B- We did not hear the phone in the room at 7.30 a.m the next morning as we were trying to sleep 4 to a bed and who wants to be woken up at that hour of the morning anyway when they are on their holidays. The bottom line was that the room was unsuitable for use, we paid for 4 star accomodation and we did not get it, and were treated appallingly when we tried to reasonably request a discount. While this hotel is modern, and very central, if this is the way that they deal with customer issues, I would be wary of staying here.

Brilliant location! The room was no bigger than a postage stamp with very little space around the bed. The small windows looked into the rooms opposite so we kept the curtains closed.

The toilet was to the right as you went in, right up against the door meaning you could be seen clearly sat on the loo. Not a good look when your partner is lying in bed. Lovely bathroom furniture but the window was in the shower and couldn't be opened properly because of the shower head. Very badly designed.

Not surprising that our room wasnt ready, however the reception staff offered to keep our luggage and provided facilities to freshen up and get changed. They told us the room would be ready at 2pm. We then made the most of getting our bearings in Barcelona itself. The staff gave us maps and directed us to Placa Catalunya and Las Ramblas which is only a 5-7 minute walk from the hotel. We arrived back at 2pm and as promised the room was ready. As well as this, a glass of Champagne was given to us both which was a nice touch. The room we stayed in was 203 on the second floor. This overlooked Gran Via. The room was amazing. Very modern. The glassed bathroom was unique and something I have never experienced before. There were speakers in the bathroom and the best shower we have experienced in any city hotel. The bed was also extremely comfortable. Breakfast the following morning was equally as impressive with a vast selection of continental and cooked options. Plenty of tea and coffee on request. The lunch menu was also very good with large portions and reasonably priced. We had cocktails on our last evening in the bar. The waitress offered to do us surprise cocktails which were not on the menu - they were both lovely and a really nice touch. The staff could not do any more for you. They were very chatty and made our stay extra special. The hotel has a lovely terrace and a small swimming pool on the roof with very comfortable sun loungers. If I had to make one suggestion would be for a soap dish or holder to be added to the shower room - however this is nit picking because I do not have anything negative to say. I would, without hesitation suggest that if visiting Barcelona you stay in this hotel. It is a short distance from Las Ramblas and in a beautiful area. The rooms are luxurious and the whole hotel is spotlessly clean. You will not be disappointed. When we return to Barcelona we will definitely be coming back to the Grupotel Gran Via.

Even with the kinks, I would definitely return here again!", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "STENHOUSEMUIR", "Title": "\u201cWONDERFUL HOTEL WITH GREAT LOCATION\u201d", "Author": "StenhousemuirBoxers", "ReviewID": "UR66421980", "Content": "I was plesently suprised with this hotel after booking last minute at a very good price via the Ryanair web page. The hotel is located only 10 minutes walk from the main bus station and very easy to find. On arrival the staff were very helpful and receiving a glass of champagne after the journey was very refreshing. Our room was a 'comfort room' very modern and more importantly clean with maid service every day. No bath in this type of room but one of the best showers I have used. The pool is small and only open until 6pm and gets no sun after 3pm. The hotel is only 10 min walk to Placa De Catalunya at the top of Las Ramblas.", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGood choice, but be aware of glass bathroom doors...\u201d", "Author": "ARTravel82", "ReviewID": "UR64382223", "Content": "Me and my girlfriend spent 4 nights at the hotel and overall I thought that it is great value for money. The furniture and fittings are brand new and to a high standard, the beds are very comfortable and the location is pretty good. However, you must know that the ensuite bathrooms have sliding glass doors (in our case it was less of an issue as we had a corner room where the bathroom door was not visible from the bedroom) and I can see how this can ruin your stay.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hertfordshire", "Title": "\u201cFantastic, Really central, Helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "MatyMooo", "ReviewID": "UR64265556", "Content": "Booked this hotel after reading reviews on here & was a little concerned that there were so few. On arrival we found out they had only been open 3 months! We were greeted at reception by very friendly & efficient staff & a very pleasant and unexpected glass of local bubbly. We were given a local map and the receptionist took the time to point out the main sights for us. We had only booked room only as we thought \u20ac15 for breakfast was a little steep but we were given a 50% off voucher on arrival :-) Our room on the 4th floor at the back (410) was a little small but more than adequate. It had air con and lighting that worked off the room card and a great shower. Lots of freebies in the bathroom and a good mini bar. The bed was very comfortable and the flat screen TV had plenty of channels, think we found three in english. Breakfast had lots of choice from eggs and bacon, ham and cheese, pastries and different rolls and breads, juices, cereals, fresh fruit and teas and coffee's to jams so should suit just about everyone. They do seem to have a small teething problem with the flooring in the dining area but it looks as though it is being sorted and they were very careful to sign the wobbly bits. Not sure if they do a full dinner service as we ate out but there is a small menu in the bar area. We didn't use the outdoor pool as the weather wasn't fantastic but it looked great and seemed very clean - they do charge extra for towels and robes so you may want to bring your own. We did make use of the two free computers to check flight info but had to get them to re-boot the network one morning. It has a few places to sit on the ground floor and free newspapers to read in several languages. It had some really interesting lighting, but probably what you would expect from a modern hotel. We loved how central this hotel was which meant we were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go. Slightly disconcerting that no cab drivers knew it but it has only been opened a short while.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201ctop hotel, inexpensive cost\u201d", "Author": "YumWill", "ReviewID": "UR64024879", "Content": "we booked this through lastminute.com and it was a real find. after staying in a slightly grotty apt we thought we'd splash out a bit on our last night, we were prepared to pay more for somewhere like this but at just \u00a375 for a double comfort room we felt we got a bargain. very central yet quiet, friendly staff, everything new and modern, good breakfast - can't fault it whatsoever. do it!", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Grupotel Gran Via 678", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1718864-Reviews-Grupotel_Gran_Via_678-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$135 - $296*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Gran Via Corts Catalanes, 678</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08010</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1718864", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/40/31/4031c63df2a38510df98a61db754df994large.jpg"}}
