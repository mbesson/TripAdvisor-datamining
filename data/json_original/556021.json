It was conveniently near Termini station but far enough from all the noise of the station surroundings. You walk from the hotel to Termini in less than five minutes. The noise from the streets was nicely blocked by the windows. We also liked that the hotel was behind three locked doors - we really felt safe there! The staff was very nice, but they didn't really speak english. The old and small elevator was sympathetic ;) - and it fits four adults just fine. Air-con worked perfectly! The neighborhood felt safe. However, our room was very small, dirty and just awful in every possible way. There were cables hanging from the TV, a hole in the bathroom door because the table was hitting it every time you open the door to bathroom. The closet was small, had only two shelves and you could only open one door completely. Even though the room was cleaned every day it was still dirty, dusty and filthy. The sockets didn't work so we had to charge our phones, camera and laptop in bathroom. Only one socket worked in the room. It was very annoying! The sheets were changed only once a week. Basically you don't get any of the usual hotel services here (such as multi-lingual staff to help you with your everyday questions, cleaning, clean sheets several times a week etc.). You get a tiny, nasty room and that's it. There wasn't even a hair drier. When we travel, all we need is an average, clean and safe room with nice staff. This room was far from nice, even far from average. It was horrible! This place is good for only one or two nights max!", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "malta", "Title": "\u201cmuch better that expected\u201d", "Author": "leomalt", "ReviewID": "UR95293609", "Content": "some review make you expect the worst but it's not that bad considering that's it's one of the cheapest hotels in rome. the room was clean and contrary to what was said the rooms and bathrooms are not that small (i went to 3 star hotels whose rooms were smaller), ok the lift is a bit scary and too small. with that regards the staff it depended on who was at the reception one was helpful the on ther not that much. remember to take cash with u as you have a charge if u pay with credit card. we didnt have breakfast", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201c\" Soggarno Sunny really Funny apartment and not hotel at all!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "kpurush321", "ReviewID": "UR87943712", "Content": "It is to advice to fellow travellor any where from world that this kind of hotel in Rome, a beautiful place in Italy is very aweful!!!

Three entrances and fourth entrance is a narrow elevator-- only one and half person can enter!!!

So we come to this other building(it's above 10 minutes by walking). The most uncomfortable thing's was that in this building were not reception.

This place's metal \"cage\" elevator worked only half of the time we were there, and the first time we had to carry our luggage and climb 80 steps in a dimly-lit dark staircase at night to the fourth floor to check in (ground floor is actually Floor Zero). Once there, you must pay your entire stay in advance, even though you might already be having second thoughts after seeing the price, the value of the accommodations and might be immediately considering going elsewhere. When we stayed, three light bulbs went out and were never replaced, and the soap/shampoo was never replaced after the first use.

It is a 10 minute walk from Termini Station. If you are going to stay at this hostel please make sure where is it located otherwise it will take you a lot to find it. To get into the hostel you need to buzz twice, once for the street gate, and once to get into the building (is the one on your right as you walk in). You have to take the elevator (very narrow) fits 3 people without luggage, or take the stairs... did I mention 8 floors? Anyway, once you get there you feel very welcome by a Chinese guy at the reception. If you speak a little Italian or Chinese, you'll do great. If it is only English then you may have a little difficulty to communicate but you'll manage. Rooms are small. Forget a romantic getaway. This place is for budget travelers who will spend most of their time outside the hostel. Another option is the Soggiorno Sun, a property of the same family and it is just 4 minutes from the Soggiorno Sunny (closer to Termini). It is located on the second floor of an apartments building. We booked at Soggiorno Sunny but when we got there they send us to Soggiorno Sun because they were overbooked. I am glad they did that. The rooms are newer, and bigger. There is no Reception at Soggiorno Sun, they give you the three keys and you are on your own. Of course you pay in advance and when you leave you can -well- leave the keys in the room. Another advantage, besides no two buzzing in, or 8 floor, and newer bedrooms, is that there are more restaurants near by, and the Termini is closer. I only stayed here for one night so other travelers may have more info to give. I think 90\u20ac is overpriced for a double room. You can find better deals for this amount. Do not let the pictures to mislead you. I hope this information is useful to your plans.

The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the Termini where you can get the metro to anything such as the Coloseum and the Vatican, as well as a bus to the airport. It is also situated near restaurants. The hotel was perfect for our budget. A nice friendly room of decent size, comfortable and clean. Although the owners didn't understand much English they tried their best and always welcomed us with a smile. There are 8 flights of stairs up to this hotel but there is a small lift to use. The only down falls of this hotel was the shower and the tv was not in english, but as we had gone to Rome to see the sights and not to watch tv this did not bother us much.

Ask to see the room and then pay, if you don't like it leave and let them charge the one night fee to your credit card, you will be glad you did. We paid up front and were not satisfied with our room for two reasons, one reason was we had a double bed confirmed but upon our arrival we received 2 single beds that couldn't be fixed until the next day. Secondly we spoke to the manager and thought we were under a mutual agreement that 3 of the nights would be credited back to us. When we received our credit card bill we had been charged for all 4 nights and never stayed one night. We contacted the manager again and he refused to refund our money and the credit card company also refused to refund our money.
