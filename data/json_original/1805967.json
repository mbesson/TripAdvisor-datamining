As soon as we sat down he acted like our presence was an imposition--he was curt, forgot to bring parts of our order, and generally made us feel quite unwelcome. He served us on two different occasions and was the same during both. Also of note for travelers--the shuttle only has eight seats and goes once per hour, so get your reservation in early. We ended up getting our third time choice, meaning we got to the airport four hours before our departure.

The reception is both bright & modern and looks very new. At reception explained that I was PLAT AMB and enquired if there where any upgrades available and I was told that I had already been upgraded to deluxe room on groundfloor. Receptionist proceeded to read all my apointments for the next day as my Hotel booking confirmation document was stapled to my appointment sheet and map to find the Hotel. I thought this was rude and when I said \"Excuse me but that has nothing to do with my reservation\" she continued to read every page. The chap who drives the mini bus made no fuss that I had parked my big high top van behind him as the car park has height restriction. THE ROOM Room had seperate corridor to room with sliding door that was very nice and made the room feel bigger. King size bed, with four pillows (all same) NO complimentary spray etc to help you sleep. Great desk although only two plug sockets. The room was very cold, the heating worked fine but the floor remained incredibly cold, no slippers available. Coffee machine in room with three capsules although neither myself nor my colleague could work out how they worked (NOT NESPRESSO) and when turned on they made a terrible noise as the tray would shake and evrything rattled. Matress was firm although a matress topper would make a world of difference. NO WIFI in room!!! How stupid is that? A cable was provided by reception that just reached the bed so that you can surf in comfort although as the room was so cold this meant untucking the bed and laying sideways. This is not the case at the HI Express next door! Simply cannot understand WHO would make the decision to have NO WIFI??? Bathroom OK - NO ROBE RESTAURANT I had visited this restaurant 7 months ago after staying at the HIE next door, just like then we stood there waiting with nobody around for 10 minutes and then decided just to sit down, on previous visit we simply walked out and went to the 5 Pine tree's down the road. Service was slow bearing in mind at 10pm we where the only people in the restaurant. I requested some balsamic and was given olive oil. Requested wholemeal bread with ham & cheese selection (\u20ac20) and was given dry sliced wholemeal that had the bottom crust cut off to get rid of the mould. Bread rolls served where dry & tasteless. Cuttlery was dirty on both courses and glass for my colleagues coke was chipped. Cheese & Ham was fantastic although the lack of decent bread was a real let down. Main course steak & burger all OK. I ordered the best bottle of red on the Menu (Ribera del Duero) also very good. I will not be using the restaurant again. BREAKFAST Stood at entrance waiting 4/5 mins then decided to sit at same table as last night, after selecting some toast etc (no coffe to be seen) I had returned toi buffet to get some orange juice when the server-waiter had returned and was telling my colleague in a loud agressive manner that he could not sit at that table and then repeated \"move move move- no sit here\" I shouted out \"stay where you are, I like that table\" This guy then comes steaming up to me and says what is your room number? I said \"I do not know, but my key card is on the table\" he then said \"You cannot sit there\" I explained that I had sat there last night and intended to sit there this morning and walked off, feeling that this guy was going to grab me from behind as he was really wound up. We where not offered coffee, neither was the poor chap that entered after us as the waiter hid out the back in the kitchen. Within ten minutes several members of staff walked back and forth giving us dirty looks. We finished our breakfast and was never asked our room numbers. My colleague also discovered that his orange juice glass was chipped! \u20ac16 for breakfast that offered; toast, rolls, ham & cheese, cold fried eggs, scrambled eggs (dont go there) chorizo chipolatas (repeated on me all day) frankfurters, various cereals, juices & yoghurts. Breakfast 0/10 I have visited numerous Crowne Plaza Hotels and have always left feeling like I had experienced a fantastic stay, NOT at CP Madrid Airport. When I was leaving the Hotel after breakfast I could not find my apointments sheet that was attached to my reservation sheet. The receptionist had kept it!!! Great property, staff would benefit from working at Crowne Plaza Lumpini Park Bangkok where the service from arrival to departure is flawless and makes you feel welcome. Rate was \u20ac60 per room just \u20ac5 more than our regular HI Express in Madrid, I would stay again but avoid eating at the Hotel.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cValue for money\u201d", "Author": "Purav00", "ReviewID": "UR121042230", "Content": "Great 4 star hotel very close to the airport.

I think the access to the local train system is there as well so it would be possible to get into the centre without using taxis. The hotel is nicely furnished, good bathrooms, although the beds are very firm but this seems to be the norm for hotels in Madrid; the double glazing is effective and blocks out the majority of aircraft noise (flights start back up at around 6a.m.). We also did not hear any noise from any other guests although there were initially a few people in the bar drinking when we arrived so the hotel was not empty. We didn't eat in the restaurant as we had eaten on the train to Madrid, but the food coming out looked good. We spent the evening in the bar (we didn't mean to stay so long) as the barman was SO FRIENDLY he is a credit to the company. We had a variety of meats and cheeses to try while we enjoyed the excellent wine in the bar/restaurant. The receptionist was also very friendly and helpful.

This time included being hustled by a cab for 55 EURO (my friends paid 75 EURO), having to make a phone call to the property and watching other airport shuttles pass by multiple times AND wait for guest. Next, this property is in the middle of a failed development, probably as a result of the world economy. There is ZERO around except for the Holiday Inn Express across the street. The area is dirty, and since it sit off a highway, it seems even the air quality around here is suspect. Moving on, let's discuss the lack of hot water, which is virtually none. The staff seems nice but since they are so short staffed here, it comes through in the service. All of this leads me to believe one thing: this hotel is barely surviving and are cutting all kinds of corners. I am simply not happy with this property for a multitude of reasons.

All of the decor and fittings are top-quality, the rooms super-equipped right down to fluffy towels (instead of threadbare ones).

This is not a romantic hotel and there is nothing around it of interest, but for the business traveler and the long-distance driver, it is ideal. There is a secure underground car park.

The flight was a bit delayed so I wasn't outside until 10:20 pm or so. I called the hotel and was told to wait for the shuttle. I was not told to wait at a particular spot, so I was waiting at the curb by the bus stops near the arrivals (this area, as the entire airport, is huge).
