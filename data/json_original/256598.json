The room was immaculate, the bed was comfortable, it was peaceful and quiet and the staff were wonderful. I felt safe and secure right down in the cross or as I like to call it \"party central.\" The area is well policed, the atmosphere is fun. I'm not a party person by any stretch of the imagination, but you couldn't help liking the atmosphere of this place at night. It comes alive! There are places open 24/7 whether you want a good cup of latte or a pie to eat at 3 a.m. (I recommend the pie shop across the road.) You have to go to the second floor of the hotel to get to reception, but I like the added security of needing a room key to get any further up in the elevator. The underground parking was a bit of a pill, it never wanted to let us out, but a minor problem at best. The breakfast in the morning on the second floor was delicious. Buses run right outside the door and the train station is adjacent. Despite all this, there was absolutely no noise with the double pane windows.

The rooms were neat and tidy and quite adequate. Housekeeping did a good job of cleaning them while we were out during the day. However the lighting in the rooms was poor and we had to open the drapes all the way in order to see properly. That was ok during the day but obviously not so at night. Internet is very expensive in the hotel,more so than we are used to in Canada. However there are many Internet cafes within walking distance that you could use at a fraction of the price. The concierge desk was a hit and miss. There was one fellow during the day that seemed quite knowledgeable and helpful (don't remember his name) and we tried to use him whenever we could. The others on the desk were a disappointment. On two separate occasions we asked for recommendations on a Thai and an Italian restaurant close by as we were walking. Upon reaching both locations, and after one long walk, both were closed down and did not exist. We would expect that the concierge desk should know and have an updated list of restaurants in the area. We did not use them again for restaurants. We did however discover an excellent restaurant on our own that you could walk to but it is a significant uphill walk and worth the taxi fare. It was called The Winery and I recommend making reservations and to sit upstairs. Excellent decor, food and service. It would seem that we always got the best service in Sydney from servers who were not born and bred Australian. We experienced that quite often in the cafes and pubs around the hotel and the popular areas in Sydney The front desk was always helpful and friendly. The location of the hotel is adequate and is near Central train station which is a bonus when you get tired of walking back from a day of sight seeing. It is a long walk to Darling Harbor and a significant walk to the Sydney Bridge,Opera House,Circular Quay and the Rocks area. However there are many good pubs in between to rest your feet and have a beer or glass of wine. You will meet people from all over the world in these pubs. A small bar in the lobby area which always seemed to be busy or full at the end of the day with business types, so we did not use it . Not too many bars in the immediate area at night to enjoy a beer after long days.Best to find somewhere in the more downtown area on the way back to the hotel.

TV reception was very poor, with no digital channels (GO, channel 11 etc) but you don't spend much time watching TV anyway so not a big deal. Bathroom was an adequate size but the shower curtain was not. Keep the curtain INSIDE the bathtub or you will saturate the bathroom floor. Housekeeping was adequate, with the exception of our tissues not being replaced when used up (one of us had a cold). Air conditioning in room was excellent- we set it at 24 degrees and it was sufficiently cold for us. Staff were lovely. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. We left our luggage with concierge when we checked out and found the service excellent. Didn't have breakfast at the hotel so can't comment on that. Overall, a good hotel. If staying for a few days, a my-multi weekly pass could be handy to reach destinations that are a bit further (Circular Quay for example).

My wife and I traveled with two children (aged 9 and 12) and we had a room with two double beds and stayed for seven nights. It was our second stay at the hotel. It might seem a strange thing to focus on but one of the standout items for us was the guest laundry! The hotel had set aside a small room with a washer and dryer, enabling us to get the laundry done without a trek to the nearest laundromat. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big plus when travelling with kids and / or when being away from home for more than few days. Other similar hotels (even ones in the Accor chain) could take note of this. Staff were always friendly and courteous and the concierge / porters particularly helpful with local directions and assistance with baggage. We stayed in a standard room, so with the two double beds and three pieces of luggage, it was a bit of a squeeze but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend a huge amount of time in the room anyway. The two double bed configuration was acceptable (the only other choice to cater for our family was to get two rooms). However, while we are not particularly tall, queen beds would have made for a more restful night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. Even better would have been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfamily rooms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with, for example, one queen and two singles or a queen and a double decker bunk bed configuration. The kids are of the age where they will still share a bed now but next time we head to Sydney we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to seek out more family friendly configurations. At the risk of getting on the soapbox, in our experience there is a dearth of family accommodation worldwide in hotels of this standard. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big market and if hotels could provide bedding configurations to sleep a couple plus two or more children (other than in trundle beds squeezed into a small room) then travelers would respond positively. The hotel is frequented by airline flight crew and cabin staff and hosted a lot of foreign tourists. We were impressed to see a reception staff member speaking fluent French (I think) to a French speaking guest! We took advantage of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pillow Menu\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and requested some firmer pillows than the standard ones supplied (at no charge). That was a nice touch. We paid in advance for the buffet breakfast and this was good value, as kids eat for free with an accompanying adult. There were cafes etc nearby but when you compare the range and value of the buffet, you are better off eating in the hotel if you have children. The hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have mini bars but instead \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsmart bars\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 located on each floor. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good idea if you are traveling with children as it is easier to resist the temptation! Wifi and internet connections were available in each room and in a business room, but at extra cost. If places like MacDonalds and cheap hotels can offer free wifi (even for a limited time) then surely the Mercure should have been able to do so as well. The hotel is right on Railway square on George Street, so access to buses and trains is easy. As is access to Chinatown, Paddy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Market (walking distance); and Circular Quay and city centre just a few stops away. There are a range of eating places nearby.

The staff were constantly helpful and professional, no matter what needed to be done, or what time of night it was.

However, I was completely unaware of this and there was no additional mess, or noise, as might be expected. My one point of concern: on two occasions, despite being made aware of my allergies, the hotel gave me food containing dairy. However, on both these occasions it was very quickly rectified and I understand additional staff training has been implemented. The facilities were top-notch. Everywhere I went was wheelchair accessible (though I did not visit the gym or sauna). Staff were excellent at communicating directly with me, and did not attempt to liaise with my carers on matters that concerned me. However, one point, the shower chair was bolted slightly too high on the wall for me to use (I am only 4'10\") and the bedroom doors are rather awkward to open for someone with little arm strength.

I was told this is because some people don't pay be credit cards, even though I had. -when I complained that my room key didn't work, the hotel manager told me that he didn't want to say it was my fault, but that the strips can get demagnitized. I told him I am used to staying in hotels, I know how keys work and it wasn't my fault, because I hadn't put the key anywhere near my other cards or any magnetic devices.

Not sure which type of room it was but it was two double beds which was more than enough for my friend and I. One of the lights flickered we were quite spooked but only to be reassured by my friend's father who said that it's an old bulb which just needed to be changed. We called for someone to change the bulb, took the guy about 10 mins to reach our room to figure out what happened. He examined the bulb and said he will change it (which required him to go fetch the bulb) so we waited for him another 10 mins. When he came back, he tried to fix it and realised that it was the wrong bulb. So we had NO choice but to wait for him to come back with a new bulb. Finally he came back with the right bulb and also took some time to fix it. All in all, despite getting a new bulb, his way of solving this minor issue kinda bugged me that he took his own sweet time when two girls were already spooked by the lightbulb. But other than this, the rooms were great, breakfast spread was great too; the location is pretty good too; very near to the Central station and within 15 mins walk to Paddy's Market and Chinatown.

I checked in late after a flight from Perth and found that the bathroom smelt strongly of urine. In the morning I reported this to reception and some hours later when I returned to my room, housekeeping was just finishing off. I asked what had been done about the smell and she proceeded to get a spray bottle and spray some room deodorizer around. On the way out, I again let reception know that the smell was there and they said they would get \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmaintenance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to have a look. Upon return to the hotel, no one could account for whether maintenance had been to my room. Later, when I let the water out the bath, it bubbled up into the basin. I called reception and asked for the Manager to come to my room to see and smell the situation for his/her self and a few minutes later a maintenance person showed up. I again called and asked for the Manager. An Assistant Manager showed up and said there was little he could do. I stated that I would be checking out if he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find me another room. I was moved two floors down to the noisy front of the hotel. The room was fine except there was no bedside lamp. I left a note at reception \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but no lamp was forthcoming. I completed a card to request a customer survey be sent to me by email and this has not arrived. Upon checkout, I asked that the Manager contact me and this hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happened either. I can only conclude that Management actually does not want to know about the issues at this hotel. Internet charges are exorbitant at $10 per day and some floors are smoking floors, best avoided.

Bathroom was a good size, if a little dated. Bathroom had odour that was not pleasant and there was no exhaust fan. Happy to have the door shut and did not enjoy going in there at all. Dined at the restaurant that night, the menu was limited and the pricing was average. I ordered a steak that was particularly average and whilst it was on the specials menu I later discovered the identical dish on the room service menu and for a cheaper price! My son had a toasted sandwich from the kids menu which was great. The room service menu was far more comprehensive and better priced than the restaurant and the service (we later ordered dessert in room) was excellent. The bed was comfortable, however was prone to moving around as it was not fixed to the bedhead and is on wheels and in the morning I discovered a bloodstain on the quilt that was not mine! There was a pillow menu that we did not use and the provided pillows were more than adequate. Very disappointed that there is no mini bar, and that the smart bar concept was not mentioned at check in and so it was not until we were wanting a drink later on that we realised we did not have the correct type of card to use the service and would have to go down to reception to have it organised. It ended up just as easy to go to the convenience store next door and purchase supplies! The rooms are not very quiet. We could hear noise on both sides of the room and the sound of other room doors slamming shut was quite noisy inside. The sound of talking in the hallway was quite loud and we were disturbed well into the night. We had an interconnecting door with the next room and as a consequence could hear noise from that room quite well also. The buffet breakfast the next morning was fantastic.

We booked this hotel based on the pictures displayed on the website/Tripadvisor photos and the location we thought was good. We took the train from the airport which drops you off at central station next door to the hotel which is very convenient. The hotel itself is in a good location if you are planning to stay anywhere in Chinatown. For us, we went to Sydney to see the CBD and harbour front attractionsm. We found the location to be a bit far from the main tourist area as Sydney is a massive city. Even if you decide to take the metro throughout the city, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have as many stops as other major cities so there is still a lot of trekking involved and with your hotel located north far from the major attractions, this can mean a lot of walking. The hotel staff was very friendly upon arrival and took our bags until the room was ready as we arrived early. There are many places to eat nearby as there seems to be a large number of backpackers that congregate in this area. The room had a very nice view of the main street and was very bright and spacious. The only poor aspect was how incorrect the pictures were when portraying the hotel. I am one who never judges a hotel on its personal website pictures but after looking at some of the Tripadvisor personal photos, I was still a little disappointed. The room was very clean and came with all of the amenities required for a standard hotel. The room was a little noisy at night as you can hear people in the surrounding rooms as the building may be a bit older. The pool was located near the top of the building with amazing views but again was a bit over done on the website. Not that it was dirty or unclean for swimming, it was just a little outdated and could do with a new paint job. The bus to Bondi is located outside the front door along with the train to Blue Mountains which is very convenient. There is also a bar downstairs with a very reasonably priced happy hour which is a welcome site for this very expensive city. Overall this is a standard, clean and friendly hotel but in a poor location if you are looking to walk around Sydney for a few days as it can become very tiring doing the 20-30 minute walk to the harbour front each morning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to the airport and all out of town attractions so the Mercure is a hotel with a lot of positive aspects but its location to the harbour front is its major drawback.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois, USA", "Title": "\u201cMercure Sydney is the best place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR117601146", "Content": "Conveniently located in the heart of the City, easy access to transportation, courteous and friendly staff.

Only \"complaint\" was that we phoned reception that night and again next morning to request a morning newspaper which was nvever delivered (or someone else took it!) and had to go down to the concierge to get it ourselves.

We were staying here because we had a concert to go to. We arrived at the hotel and I checked in. We then drove the car to the car park and parked the car. Parking was priced at a special deal of $15. We were given a room on the 12th floor, which at the time seemed exciting. When the lifts opened to the floor I was a tad shocked. The walls were painted in patches and the hallway was dark. It looked cheap! Definitely not we had imagined of an alleged redeveloped hotel. We arrived at our hotel room. The room looked clean and spacious. The room had a flat screen television and a view of railway square. The room was pretty quiet too. I then noticed a letter on the desk, it said that there was going to painting done of some of the floors. I was quite concerned because I am an asthmatic and the paint fumes may make me sick. A staff member arrived at our room to deliver our bottle of wine, I asked her if they will be painting on our floor today, and she said no. We then left our room for a few hours and returned, it seemed that our level was painted because the patches of paint were no longer present on the walls. Luckily there was no paint fumes. I felt quite irritated for the fact that the staff member who checked us, did not tell us about the painting! We also noticed at several instances on level 12 where we stayed, there were stenches of cigarette smoke. I called and inquired with reception and they advised me that level 10 and 11 were smoking levels. What made it worse, was that level 11 and 12 had this gap between the levels, like a large hole so the fumes could travel easily to the next level. We once again found this quite irritating, because this was not told to us when we checked in. The room itself was clean, bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean. The only minus of the bathroom was the shower curtain, which seemed a tad dirty on the ends of the shower curtain. The hotel itself is closely situated near Railway Square, which is handy for catching buses and trains. The car parking spaces are quite narrow and quite often you would see people parking in two spaces! Upon check out we told the reception male staff member about the smoke fumes problem and he apologised and he said he would investigate it with management. He then offered us complimentary parking, which a nice gesture. We then got into our car and drove to the exiting gates of the car park. We placed the ticket in the machine and it said we have to pay $30. We were shocked, because we were told we were given complimentary parking! My partner pressed the intercom button and spoke to reception and explained the situation. The lady at reception hung up on us. Nothing happened for a few minutes, so I pressed the intercom again and explained the situation and she huffed and then the gates opened! In summary, I was not entirely happy with this hotel. Whilst the positioning was convenient, I was not happy with the customer service and the lack of communication. I find it quite weird that a hotel would have 2 smoking floors mid level in a hotel or decide to paint the hallways and not notify customers before or during the check in process.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle", "Title": "\u201cBest service ever.\u201d", "Author": "LesleyDG Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR116966604", "Content": "I had the best stay at the Mercure Sydney for a weekend prior to a trip overseas.

Very good at putting things right with someone sent up within 5min of reporting any problem. We didn't use the restaurant so can't comment. Room service was average hotel stuff. Each floor has vending machines (chargeable to your account) which were great for grabbing nibbles and drinks. We took a look at the pool but it's tiny. It was full with just 3 people swimming. The only real negative was noise. Our floor had a seating area in the corridor, which meant that people tended to gather there and we were disturbed throughout the evening (up to about 11pm most nights) with children running around screaming or groups of people gathering. I believe the seating areas are on multiple floors. The walls were pretty thin too and the door blocked no sound at all. We were woken up two nights running by a particularly loud lady who struggled with her door card.

But in this room you can choose your preferred pillow from a menu, which is nice. The bathroom seems stuck in the eighties but is perfectly functional, with the usual amenities provided. Breakfasts are adequate and will fill you up, even if the quality of the food may not satiate your appetite. The best thing about the Mercure is its location, which is next to Central station. If you are taking a train to and from the airport, this is really very convenient. Don't bother with the pool or the gym.

No mattress was provided for the baby cot. I had to use the blanket as the mattress. I needed to put on the blanket, bed sheet etc. myself. For most of our stay, housekeeping did not bother to make up the baby cot. The kettle was old too and the lid was fixed and could not be opened. I asked for the one with open lid and was told by reception they only had the fixed lid type. Later, housekeeping came and I asked where I can buy a open lid one. The housekeeping was very helpful and asked whether I wanted to change to an open lid one and they actually had it! Wonder why in the first place, reception told me there was no such open lid type. Is it because it was only reserved for those staying at the deluxe or suite? The shower head was a little bit weird cos' the water was distributed too widely and the water stream could not be changed. Even the shower head at my home has this function of altering water stream.

I was travelling alone so it was merely a humerus oversight and went straight in the bin. But had I been travelling with my wife, girlfriend, better half, etc I could have been up for some serious explanations. The second was the lack of directions to Circular Quay in Sydney. I got a 'its that way' with a quick point of the hand. That was it. No map, or its a 25 minute walk, or go down that street, can I call you a cab, etc. The third was I requested a room away from the elevator. I've had bad experiences in the past and wanted a good nights sleep. So which room do I get? Literally the one closest to the elevator. But there were some brilliant staff. The person checking me in couldn't be more helpful, shared some commentary on the royal wedding, had a great sense of humour and simply seemed to enjoy her job and helping guests. (There were a few worse for ware people that night with the rain.) The concierge also offered me an umbrella for my walk down to Darling Harbour. Plus was very helpful with directions or a taxi. The sound proofing is superb. Literally not any type of sound could be heard from outside. Its a busy street down below. So that is an excellent reason to return. The bed was medium to firm. Choice of pillows, quality linen, comfortable, no sagging and so forth. Room size was excellent, nice space and things didn't feel cramped at all. Nice fittings, decent sized study desk, new LCD television and the usual suspects. Plus internet wasn't the best price around. But it was cheaper than other hotels I've stayed with. Price was excellent. I recommend booking through the hotel directly, rather than the discount sites, as it was actually cheaper through their website.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that the Mercure does not have a waterside site and may not be in a particularly fashionable area; it does, however, have excellent staff. In three days, I guess we encountered ten staff, from the reception staff, to concierges, and restaurant personnel. All were superb. Whilst I can recall the names of some, it would not be fair to pick them out as we were uniformly impressed. If you are coming from the airport, the Airport Link train is recommended. Expensive on a cost per mile/kilometre basis (like the Heathrow Express) but it is very frequent and avoids traffic congestion. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another way in which the Mercure scores because it is four minutes walk from Central Station; try to make sure you exit the platform at the correct end although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a problem if you come out on the Belmore Park side. Because of our inbound flight from the UK and efficiency of the Airport Link, we were at reception by 07.20. Incredibly, we were in our hotel room by 10.30 because the staff \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfell over\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 themselves to help. Really welcome after a very long flight. In fact, we could have had a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsmoking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room even earlier, had we wished. The Queen Superior is a good size room and ours had views down George Street with some very clear landmarks (such as the old Post Office Building, Ernst and Young Tower). The hotel is no distance from the Sydney landmarks, e.g. brisk walking of less than ten minutes brings you to Hyde Park and the Botanic Garden in fifteen. That means Farm Cove with its views of Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House is about twenty. In fact, I am not convinced it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth taking the train from Central to Museum and walking the rest of the way. Breakfasts are good although having stayed at the Mercure Berlin An Der Charite just three weeks ago enables me to make a direct comparison. Sorry, Berlin has the edge on breakfast but only just. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buffet style with a good range of options. The Bircher Muesli now seems global. All in all, I am pleased we chose this hotel over some others with, apparently, better views. With the sterling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dollar exchange rate and leaving booking late, this hotel was not cheap, it does offer value.

Another disappointment was the restaurant in the lobby of the hotel does not allow teens under 18 years! Our room was nicely appointed and clean. There was a mini fridge, coffee/tea maker and supplies. The concierge arranged transfers back to the airport for us at only $14 each.

It's a very average three-star hotel, but it comes with prices that suggest 4-5 stars. Accommodations were middling, and service left something to be desired. The average price per night for my stay was a bit more than $300. I had a \"Privilege\" room, which supposedly offers extra amenities, but as far as I could tell this really came down to a box of chocolates and a bathrobe. Unfortunately, the room itself did not reflect much in the way of luxury. Furnishings were OK, but the bathroom looked and felt cheap. All bathroom fixtures and the ugly yellow-and-white checkered tile on the floor looked as though they had been selected with economy as the primary concern. The shower curtain was flimsy, and tended to want to fly away while I was showering. The sink was a pedestal-style and offered no counter space to put toiletries or even a space for soap. Water pressure was fine, but temperature calibration was very fussy. The bed, desk, and chair were all suitable, though the closet was actually an added-on wardrobe, as opposed to a built-in. This room gets zero points for interior design. The TV was a flat screen, which was nice, but the picture was definitely low-def and the channel selection was weak. One big plus: Internet access was wired and fast, and I was not charged extra for the access. I had several interactions with staff that left something to be desired. First, I requested a room with a city view, and was told this would not be a problem. Well, I did not get a city view room; my room faced entirely the opposite direction. Worse, I looked out at a empty, black, and eroding billboard. To top things off, the backside of the billboard was illuminated by a row of blindingly bright lights that shone in my window all night long. (See attached photo.) I had to pull the blinds entirely closed every night. All things considered, I don't know that I've ever had a worse view, and to have been lied to about being granted a city-view room made it all the more galling. Furthermore, one day the staff simply did not clean my room. Housekeeping knocked in the morning as I was getting dressed, and I asked if they could return later. I ended up leaving my room at about noon, placing the \"Please Clean My Room\" sign on the door handle, and when I returned late that evening the sign was still there. They also managed to mangle my laundry - one cotton pique shirt has returned to me with impossibly long arms. I'm not quite sure what they did with it. The concierges were hit-and-miss. One was surly, one was never at his station, and one gave me flatly wrong walking directions - sending me hopelessly in the wrong direction and 30 minutes out of my way before I realized he simply didn't know what he was talking about. Others, though, were friendly and helpful. One helped me book tickets to an exhibit at the art museum - without his help I would have spent hours queuing in line at the museum. Worst, though I gave more than 24 hours notice, I was flatly denied when I tried to take one night out of my reservation, as a side trip to Melbourne for business cropped up. The location of the hotel is pretty good - it is close to Chinatown, within a 20-25 minute walk from Darling Harbor, and just a few blocks from Central train station. Unfortunately, however, it's sort of just on the outskirts of the central business district, and about as far away from the water as you could be while still being in the CBD. If you are in Sydney as a tourist, I think you should be able to do better. The business center is a joke - it's just a room with a few computers and a printer, and it smells like stale cigarette smoke. It is unstaffed - you have to get a passcard at the front desk. There is no scanner, and the hotel staff were of no use as I did need something scanned. I was told they had no scanner, and none could point me in the direction of somewhere that did. Overall, this hotel is a very average 3-star joint with a pretty good but not great location. It is clean and comfortable enough, but the high sticker price contributes to expectations the hotel can't possibly meet. Service is a mixed bag. It's a functional hotel, but not much more than that.", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shellharbour, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNice place to stay\u201d", "Author": "arbulluss", "ReviewID": "UR98285358", "Content": "I stayed here overnight with some girlfriends in Dec 2010.

The Mecure could be for you. I stayed here with my young son. Found the rooms small. Yes, a bit of room they could have been wider and provision for a long desk and somewhere to put your luggage. We had a room with two single beds, bigger than the average and really comfy to sleep in. You have the option of order different pillow types from the Pillow Menu. The desk provided was for one person so my son had to sit right at the TV on an otterman with little room. This was for the room service meals of course. The TV has local and Foxtel. But he was disappointed at not being able to get Nickolodeon. The bathroom, whilst small, was very clean and amenities provided. Shower over the bath. A fan would be helpful at shower times. The aircondition, whilst a little noisy, was okay with providing some relief from the heat. We had to leave it on all the time to keep some sort of comfort in the room. There were no personal reading lamps so I had to turn all of them off to get my son to sleep and hope by turning one back on later, it wouldn't wake him. Although the room was very clean, no bin liners were provided and lack of replacement items where they attended to the room on the second day was a little frustrating. More frustrating after waiting 1hr for someone to come and replace them. (soaps & sugers). A mini bar is non-existent. You get a smart card and use the Smart Bar, found on each floor. They don't tell you this at check-in and they don't tell you that you need to leave a credit card number in order to get this card, at reception. I used debit card so had to go and attend to this. A guest laundry is provided. One washing machine and one dryer. $4 for each and $2 for powder. I just waited. Breakfast - really nice. Everything provided. Loved the scrambled eggs! Room Service - Pretty good. A little exy $$ but food was lovely and welcome after hours sightseeing. Found most of the staff lovely. Who ever seemed to be incharge of the dining room, always so sour in their faces. Not just the same person either. But I got over that. The lovely concierge from NZ, Shane I think, was just lovely. The others....didn't impress me. I mentioned to the Assistant Manager at check out that I smelt cigerette smoke from the air-con vents in the room twice and he promised to look into it, and he meant it. We weren't aware of any neighbours. Being on the eighth floor, we had a restful sleep. My son loved the pool. There is also a sauna and gym area. Great view from there. There is a McDonald's, KFC, Hot Wok, Sushi takeaway restaurant, & Pub across the road. Also a few convience shops very close to the hotel. Parking was $25 a day.

Since I have stayed up to 100 nights a year in hotels, this was a very poor service experience indeed. We had booked for two nights each for ourselves already in Australia and our daughter who was coming into Sydney from the UK, but she was held up by the snow. i.e. we had booked 4 nights accomodation (2x2). Having heard that our daughter was going to be 36 hours late, we phoned the hotel early in the morning that we heard that she was held up and asked to extend our stay by one day and change our daughter's booking to one night starting two days later (i.e. still keeping the 4 nights, 3 for us and 1 for her). They refused to accept the change in the booking saying we had booked through a UK agent and we would need to get them to make the change. I pointed out that with the 11 hour time difference that would make us too late for their deadline for no-show charges. They couldn't care less, and insisted we pay another 2x$169 for the so called extra nights. To add insult to injury they also charged 1.5% for charging the credit card - I have never been charged for putting a room on the credit card at a so-called decent hotel ever before. Apart form that the room was OK, but there was no shampoo, too few towels, no wifi in the room, and we had a narrow double bed. At $169 per night unimpressive. Breakfast at $25 was very poor, with orange juice being watered down concentrate, a huge queue at the one coffee machine out of three that was actually working and the pancakes so tough you could line shoes with them. The attractive looking bowls of melon were all under ripe. Parking was $22, and interenet access also $22 per day. The internet would not allow outgoing mail from outlook/outlook express. The swimming pool was closed for the three days we were there (no explanation) and from our point of view the location was awful - a long walk or a taxi ride from anywhere and everywhere. To top it all, when we checked that the room was available for our daughter, despite having paid for it they appeared to have given it away and then I was told by the receptionist that I had an attitude problem when she proceeded to call me a liar about having prepaid!

The concierge people chatted to each other and ignored me on arrival, when I asked for help and on departure. Three out of three! The check-in staff's command of English is really poor and it was actually hard to be understood. The Accor A-club membership seems a mystery to them - I certainly didn't seem to get any advantage. Finally on check-out, I found out they still charge ludicrous amounts for phone calls - over a $100 for a Sydney-Canberra call which are both in the 02 area.

But my, do the others have a tough act to follow. On visiting Sydney back in August 2008 it seemed particularly daunting to an English-countryman that I would be staying in a towering hotel located smack-bang in the middle of a bustling city. The Mercure website offered a warm and pleasant impression, which was similarly reflected by the entrance hall and the welcome desk of the hotel. The staff were pleasant and readily handed over our room key and wished us a pleasant stay. So good so far. Walking along the pristine corridors which housed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153517 modern and contemporary guest rooms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd we arrived at our door and took a deep breath before gazing bewilderedly into what would be our room. (One hears of such terrible rumours on the internet...) The room was simply beautiful. A clean, minimalist layout, yet ornate furnishings and complimenting bed linen gave the room character and appeal. A basic bathroom, a flat screen TV and complimentary biscuits. What more could one want? The hotel itself is situated right in the heart of Sydney city's modern retail district, and is no more than a 15 minute walk away from beautiful Darling Harbour or the bustling centre of Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinatown. With Sydney Central Station located next to the hotel, anyone can easily hop on a train and discover some of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest tourist destinations; such as the iconic Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge. Although if you have come to the hotel to get away from the busy schedule of everyday life, the hotel offers the magnificent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Four seasons\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd restaurant and the relaxing indoor rooftop swimming pool, gym and sauna to work those stresses away. The beds are extremely comfortable and the room is surprisingly quiet considering the lively buzz of the city that awaits outside. In summary, this really is a fantastic hotel, The quality of the rooms and the hotel is fantastic and the position is so handy for popping out for an evening of entertainment or a day of Australian culture. True, the hotel may be a little pricier than others, but for the overall ambience and excellence of the hotel, your stay will be worth every penny.", "Date": "November 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wollongong", "Title": "\u201cA first rate hotel with excellent service.\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR86469098", "Content": "We have stayed at the Mercure on a number of occasions and always enjoyed the accommodation and friendly service.

I was in Sydney for business and we only chose it, because we got a dicsount through Holiday Rewards (we bought some tyres through Beaurepairs and were given vouchers to use). This was one of the hotels we could stay at in Sydney, using these vouchers. Upon arriving, the staff were very professional and friendly. We couldnt fault the staff throughout our stay - always lovely and engaging. Location wise - its in the City, but on the edge. Everything in the CBD of Sydney was accessible - only a short walk or you could walk to the monorail and use that (about 5 - 10 mins away). Rooms - we stayed in a Studio Room. It was fine and quite large actually. It had a bedroom with dividing doors and then a kitchenette, dinner table and couch. The room was clean and had everything we needed - flat screen TV; microwave; sliding doors so we could put our sons cot on one side too (for peace and quiet!) A few marks on the walls etc - pretty standard for this class of hotel. Bathroom was fine - but it did have a shower curtain, which I am never a huge fan of! There was nothing in the mini fridge though - if you wanted water, drinks etc - you had to purchase them from a machine in the corridor, which was different. The only thing we could probably fault was the breakfast.

We stayed on a Saturday night and because of this I knew the rate would be higher but later on I found out how much the markup was for Saturday nights and was appalled I had just spend 429AUD on their King Deluxe Room. Checked in with no issues, was given our rooms by front desk. As soon as we opened the door for the room, all I could smell was a smokey/burnt smell. I had booked a non-smoking room online and had paid in advance on arrival and did not notice until we had gone up to the pool later on that we were indeed on a smoking level which I had explicitly not chosen as I cannot deal with smokers even 2 meters away let alone a room filled with the stench. Not to mention we could not even shower because the showers nozzle was facing to the ground. I am a laid back guy and I thought I could get through a night no problems but the TV died an hour later and would not turn on/froze and this is where I felt very ripped off. After spending some time in the pool (which does not look as nice as it does on their website - not to mention squashed cockroaches in the sauna) I decided enough was enough, so I went downstairs and had a word with front desk. I initially spoke to one of the girls at the front (I wont publicly display her name) regarding the issue and she said look there is nothing I can really do, we are booked out and are you sure you booked a non-smoking room (looked at me like I was an idiot). I said look, this is not good enough, so she went to speak with the manager who was sitting out the back and she came back saying we can give you a free breakfast (one that I had paid for already) so she offered me 30AUD off our total bill to compensate. Not good enough - and I aired my exact thoughts to her. This is when a must more nicer girl took over and seemed to try her best to sort out the problem, she again went and spoke to the manager (who i'm sure at this stage the staff must have to run everything by him) came back and offered me champagne and some chocolates for the discomfort - well first off my gf and I do not drink... I again told her, look freebees are not going to fix the problem, I want what I paid for - a room, non smoking, a TV and shower that works and that I was not happy with the dollar I spend on this room. I have stayed in the Vibe hotel for 100AUD before and have been 100% happier. She spoke to the manager who finally after half an hour decided to come out as I was not going to go away and forget it,. He said look, I am sorry, the rate is naturally higher for Saturday nights and you would have only paid 250AUD any other night for the King Deluxe Room - 200 diff for one night? That is ridiculous! I said look if you knock some money off the bill to compensate for my poor stay then I will be happy, I will feel like I have not wasted half a weeks wage on a sub par stay. He said this could not be done - and although he said earlier he was 100% booked out of everyroom, that he could upgrade us to a suite. Which we eventually did, which once we moved our bags in the girl earlier who was fantastic and the guy from concierge came up with some freebees anyway, unknown by the manager at this stage which put a smile on my face as the staff went to their own trouble to make me happy after basically having to wrestle the manager for some sort of compensation.

The plumbing in my room and other nearby rooms was very noisy and at 7:00AM it was quite annoying as each nearby shower screeched in turn. One good feature was very good blackout curtains in the room. Traffic noise on the 5th floor was audible but I got used to it after a couple days.

Staff encountered in lifts etc always asked if you were enjoying your stay and if you had had a good day - this would never happen in a UK hotel. The pool/gym was quite good but needed some tlc.

Sauna was nice but would never get warm due to hole in back wall and sticky door catch.

We booked via wotif.com and got an unbelievably great rate. We were expecting a basic room for what we paid but WOW, on arrival we got a free upgrade to a city view room with balcony!!!!! The first thing that strikes you as you enter the hotel is the staff. Every single member of staff that you come across in this hotel is just excellent. Immaculately groomed, bright, polite,courteous and foccused on helping the guests. The concierge guys are famous here on Tripadvsior and I would say that all of the staff team in this hotel are worthy of that recognition. Our room was a good size with a very comfy double bed, desk and chair. Nice big TV with digital channels, Foxtel and a good range of pay-for-view latest release movies. We had ample storage cabinets, a safety box, little fridge, tea and coffee making provisions. The room furnishings and decor are modern, in excellent condition and the entire room and ensuite are a credit to the housekeeping staff in terms of cleanliness. Sleep quality for us was excellent. Even though the hotel is located on a busy city interesction the street noise is not an issue in the rooms. PAYG WiFi is available in the lobby and resturant bar area. PAYG internet in the rooms is via an RJ45 plug in connector. A MacD less than 10 minutes walk away at the Entertainment Centre has free WiFi. Eating wise there is a great array of fast food outlets and vibrant, colourful Chinese and other Asian resturants in the immediate and near vicinity. If that is not your style then you are in luck because the in hotel resturant is really good. The menu includes some very stylish and imaginative dishes including:- seafood, meats and vegetarian options. The service and food presentation are both excellent and the prices are very reasonable. Although we did not breakfast in the hotel ourselves; other guests that we spoke with rated the breakfast very highly. The hotel also has a great room service; the range, style and quality of food matching that available in the resturant. The service is available 24 hours a day and a very small charge applies for the courteous and prompt delivery. BE WARNED though, this room service is addictive!!! My wife really enjoyed the swimming pool on the rooftop while I sat on the balcony sipping wine (terrific bottle shop on Ultimo Road, 5 mins walk) and looking out across the city view.

The hotel location is good if you are wanting public transport, or to be in the middle of Chinatown, otherwise I wouldn't reccommend it for location. Unfortunately Chinatown has quite a few homeless people. There wasn't much variety of restuarants except Asian, which had nice food, but more variety restaurants would be good. There is a McDonalds, KFC, Subway and Gloria Jeans across the road, but the employee's are not very good at speaking english. The food in the hotel was excellent. As we couldn't find much on the streets, we decided to eat at the hotel in the Four Elements Restaurant. The food and service was wonderful. We had the Tapa's type menu and it was delicious.

I have been travelling very frequently, and I hope my review would be decent enough:- Location: The Mercure is located just off George Street - one of Sydney's most notable city streets. Renowned for being busy round-the-clock with many corporate/business high rises, this street begins in the north end of Sydney in The Rocks, near the Sydney Harbour Bridge and extends to the southern end of the city, near Central Station. Well, this hotel is located next to the Railway Station and is nearer to Chinatown or Sydney Airport compared to the other hotels in Sydney's Central Business District. Unfortunately, George Street is at least 3km long (I think) and the Mercure is located in the opposite end of the CBD. Hotel: This hotel is not anywhere near to a 4 star rating. Barely 3 star in fact. The room is decently sized but the interior feels a little bit dated, bare (no slippers or complimentary bottles of water), it does not give you the luxurious, desirable, comfortable sort of feeling, the feeling that after a long, tired day, you would like to retire in the comfort of the room. The interior of the bathroom is pretty undesirable - floor has yellow and white tiles?!! And, apart from the very basic toilet/tissue paper, shampoo, soap, towels and hair dryer (yes, I'm not kidding you), there is nothing else!!! But most importantly, the mattress/bed sheets were clean enough. Service: The concierge was helpful enough to recommend a decent Italian restaurannearby. Reception was ok. No issues about the service - I guess I haven't experienced anything complicated during my stay. My only complaint is having to pay for internet connection (AUD5 for 1/2 hour - in this day and age, does anyone still charge for internet at such prices?!!!). Certainly this isn't a business hotel - more for tourists and cabin crew) Breakfast: Selection was average. It gets a bit crowded betweeb 8-9am, and you may have to queue for a while. There's a coffee machine for your lattes but the coffee prepared was not hot. I guess the management needs to look at it. Or for hot coffee to be constantly served to the guests. This is the 1st time I need to make my own coffee during breakfast at a 3/4 star hotel. I would only recommend this hotel if some improvements are to be made to the hotel by the management.

Hotel to Circular Quay by foot, straight down George Street will take you about 20 minutes. So not too bad! Also just 5 minutes walk to China Town/Paddys Market and another 5 minutes from there to Darling Harbour, so all in all its very nicely placed.

Went out on 4th day at 9.30a.m. returned to room at 10.30p.m. to find room not cleaned or made up. Asking for Night Duty Manager, very nice and efficient, had room made up within 30 mins, defused my annoyance very efficiently but should not have happened. Following day saw Hotel Manager who stated room had a notice on door saying not to make up room, but room next door had notice on door but not ours. Why not have a 'Make up Room' Notice? When commenting about room view, told in no uncertain terms that to have city view is about 50 AUD extra, we only booked a standard room! Dealt with complaint very efficiently but said would get room made up while we went for Breakfast across the road, (10.30a.m.) and shopping. Returned to room about 1.30p.m. to find room not touched, rang manager asked to come to room, there within 5 mins, opened door and showed him room, his face a picture of astonishment (wish I had a camera at that point). We left room and went down to Lobby, I was seething, but after a cigarette outside and remembering the look on his face soon calmed me down and I could see the funny side of it. He then came to inform us room was made up. On our last day we were not left soap but by this time I was just happy to be leaving. Money changing, found a little Western Union Office Next to Eve's Place in hotel which changed money giving a better rate than the Hotel about 8c a GBP better and at Michel's outside the Front of the hotel by coach station a coffee and Bacon & Egg roll (Baguette) 8 Aud. Experience of Sydney, expensive, but the purpose of our Visit a Marvellous result, we are now in touch with Cousins by email. Hotel - Very Disappointed. said would come back to me, on one occasions did not. On final day we found no bar of soap left so had to use shower gel bottle for washing. Maybe I am old fashioned but I find soap far better than shower gel.

I noticed right away that they didn't give us very many pillows. Later I noticed that they had a pillow menu where you select what kind of additional pillows you want brought up. They had about six different varieties to choose from. I was also amazed by the espresso maker in our room. The directions were not to hard to follow, and they brought up fresh milk on demand every day for free! This coffee was by far the best I have ever had crafted in a hotel room and I was able to eliminate buying flat whites on the street :) The location of this hotel is perfect. George street is connected to everywhere you will want to go as a tourist. The bus is right there, and the train is right there. It only took ten min to get from the airport via the train, and that is a blessing when you are dealing with a 14 hour overnight flight! :) The bar Eves place was a fun place to get local brews. The thai food was REALLY GROSS THOUGH.. dont bother with it. We did not try the eatery on level one, I suspect it would be much better than the bar/thai food ;) I noticed some other reviewers commented on how the location is very noisy. When getting into bed I could barely here a bus go by once in a while (This was from floor 13, with earplugs in...) Overall the room was very quiet. The bathroom was large and clean.. They housekeeping attended twice a day... Fridge in room really helped us keep food costs down (however they do have it pre stocked so you have to shove stuff out of the way). we were so busy touring the city I didn't get a chance to use the other amenities like laundry and fitness eq/pool.. but my husband did state that the laundry facility only had one washer and one dryer. The concierge arranged for us to have a shuttle take us from the hotel to the airport when we left. It was 12$ (au) per person, but that was better than walking a little bit with all our luggage to the train and paying 16$ (au)per person. The only BAD SURPRISE we had, was at check out we had 11$ worth of \"phone charges\". I am not demarking the hotel in the rating for this because I didn't even pay attention to the cost when I picked the phone up. My friends who live in Sydney said the calls they made to the hotel were local and should be free, and I took their word for it. I was wrong. We only talked just briefly to arrange meetings.. talked under ten minutes and paid 11$ (au) so it wasn't a big deal. The other Surprise we had was the big TV in our room only had three channels! I guess that is pretty common in Australia and we didn't care at all because we didn't go there to watch TV! They also had on demand new release movies you could purchase for 15$, but like I said we were to busy to utilize that feature.

Some are never satisfied and seem to expect champagne service on a beer budget. It is not a 5 star hotel and does not claim to be so don't judge it by those standards. For a 4 star hotel in the CBD its brilliant, go and check out its competition if you don't believe me. If you want 5 star luxury then go and pay for it. I recently splashed out on a night in a premier grand harbour view room at the Shangri La to celebrate my birthday with my wife and it was fantastic. However, if we are taking the kids into the city for a few days then the Mercure is perfect. For around $100 less than I paid for one night at the Shangri La I have just secured 3 nights at the Mercure with buffet breakfast on the last morning. Very happy with that. This hotel is EXCELLENT value when compared with other Sydney CBD hotels. I've had some great deals here. Also the car park is directly under the hotel meaning you can get your car yourself whenever you need it without waiting around for a valet driver to do it for you. You can pop down to the car to get anything you might have left behind etc, not usually an option in many hotels where you don't even know where its parked! Service has always been great when I've stayed. The buffet breakfast is huge and varied and every bit as good as in 5 star hotels I have stayed at in Sydney. Rooms are nicely designed and clean, child policy is great (kids under 12 stay free and get free brekky) and facilities are also very good. Location. Right next to Central station. Not the most glamorous spot perhaps but very convenient especially if you don't have a car with you - buses and trains to anywhere in the city at your door. Also worth noting, the hotel is surrounded by places that are open beyond 6pm. A problem I have found in other city hotels is that there is nothing nearby if you want a quick bite to eat, a coffee, carton of milk etc. It might be fast food but at least there is something open in the vicinity. This hotel fits the bill perfectly if you want decent quality in a handy location at a good price. Ask yourself if it is really worth forking out an extra $100 (or possibly quite a bit more) per night to get an in room minibar, marble bathroom, valet parking (I reckon the on site car park beats this option hands down) and a concierge that is utterly charming, knows absolutely everything there is to know but is still happy on a salary of $35k!

They said I would have to pay for the Taxi and that the shuttle was there and they would just pop it on I said is the shuttle there or is it due in now the conceirge said it's here i will pop it on I said as long if it is there and about to leave I will be happy with that. Then low and behold I rang them exacttly 11 mins after to see if I could get a number of bus to retreive my luggage at the airport to make sure i had the right bus and got another conceirge who told me the bus had just pulled up so he will run outside to have a look at the number but hang on that bus was just leaving according to the so called supervisor I was earlier talking to. My Luggage arrived at the airport at half an hour later which then had myself running with 2 small children to the check in and then to the gate which then made our plane 15 minutes late for depature and arrival. So for this reason mainly I will never recommend this hotel to anybody because i feel that ok forgeting my luggage because they didn't see me and 2 3 year olds may be overlooked but then lying about the buses that just was NOT acceptable.

The staff at the front desk were really unfriendly and on our last morning at the hotel proved to be extremely rude and nearly caused us to miss our plane.

I booked a higher priced privledge rooms which states\" complimentary chocolates, bathrobes and slippers on arrivial\" ARRIVAL: We arrived on a very busy Sun morning at 9am...was greeted by 3 bellboys at the front door. Girl at check in could have been a little happier, wasnt overly friendly, however we were able to go to our room by 10am which i thought was fantastic. ROOM: The privledge room was just a normal room on Level 13, with brief views of the city and the slippers/bathrobe/chocolates and a coffee machine. Tiny bathroom, small desk and uncomfortable desk chair. Everything was clean, fresh smelling and tidy. My gripe was the \"complimentary\" items that were suppossed to be included...there was a note attached saying that if we liked the items they could be purchased after our stay. I complained to management straight away as the website didnt state this..complimentary to me is complimentary! I dealt with a very nice man bellboy and duty manager who were more than happy to hear me out and discuss an alternative. I was moved to a bigger corner deluxe room which I am happy to say was a great room. Decent size, large plasma TV, lovely 90 degree views of the city, couch, and slightly bigger bathroom. Magazines, pay tv channels (more than your standard 5), pay per view movies and hotel info channel. LOCATION: I wanted a hotel which was close to Central Station. Many reviews on here dont let you know about the location. I am happy to report that the Mercure is very very close to Central. YOu walk out a door from reception down a walkway, and you are at the train station. Literally a 2 min walk and you dont have to cross any traffic to do so. HOTEL FACILITIES: The hotel has a restaraunt and 2 bars. We didnt use any of them but the prices looked very reasonable. We ordered room service whic arrived promptly. The food was hot and well presented and rather tasty for room service food. The prices were not cheap. There is a pool which we didnt use, a business centre (with computers and printer...the latest equipment) Internet cost me $4 for 15mins, but i believe its cheaper if you buy a 24hour pass. STAFF: The concierge were a mixed bunch. A couple of the guys were excellent with their knowledge, but one of them had no idea of dinner cruises or recommendations for good places to eat. I seemed to have more knowledge than him. Cleaning and room service staff were all polite and friendly. Front desk was good, though they did appear to chat amongst themselves too much. OTHER: Taxis frequent this hotel, and we had no problem catching one. Concierge can organise shuttle buses at a discounted rate. There is a small shop inside the hotel that sounds lollies, drinks, ice creams, toiletries and tacky Sydney souvenors. Also a Europcar rental desk for car hire. You must swipe your card to enter after 11pm and there was security present. The hotel is located very close to Chinatown. Taxis cost us $7 one way to Darling Harbour, $8 one way to PItt Street Mall $10 one way to The Rocks, $18 one way to the airport, and $28 in the airport shuttle one way. $9 return to go on the train from Central to Olympic Park. As this hotel is part of ACCOR all points programs are in place. The Mercure Sydney is a good place to stay should you get a good rate.

Mercure hotels are similar in quality to Holiday Inn Express's in my opinion. Due to concerns about street noise (yes I'm high maintenance because I'm a light sleeper) I had requested a room on an upper floor and was disappointed when I checked in and I was put on the 4th floor. However, the room was quiet and clean (and I am VERY picky when it comes to cleanliness). The amenities in this hotel are very basic, but high speed Internet access in the rooms, comfortable bed, cable TV, good hair dryer and iron/ironing board, small refrigerator, writing table and the shower is good etc. It is clean and comfortable and the staff are generally friendly and helpful. The location is great as it is right by the train station and very close to UTS, Paddy's Markets, Haymarket, Chinatown etc. There are TONS of great China town restraunts nearby and it is only a few blocks to great shopping. You can comfortably walk to lots of attractions from here. To summarize, if you're looking for a luxury accomodation this is definitely not it, but if you're looking for a comfortable, conveniently located and clean hotel then the Mercure Sydney will meet your needs.", "Date": "February 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGive it a try!\u201d", "Author": "J1821", "ReviewID": "UR13119007", "Content": "I stayed for two nights at the Mercure Sydney in October, and was impressed with the room.

When we booked online, we could only get a higher priced deluxe room for the last two nights. When we checked in, the front desk clerk asked if we wanted to keep the same standard room for our entire stay, and changed the reservation. We didn't have to move to the more expensive \"city view\" room, with no hassle. The rooms were comfortable and clean, with a safe and small fridge. Wish I could have brought my pillow home! Only complaints were lack of drawers, not enough hangers (for two girls) and didn't like the herbal bath gel, shampoo that were provided so we bought our own bath soap. The location was on George Street, which is a main street that goes straight down to the Rocks and Sydney harbour. The Mercure is located near the backpacker hostels, so lots of cheap food to be found in the neighbourhood. It's about a 20 minute walk to the more trendy shops and restaurants further down George St, and 40 minutes to Circular Quay. Or hop on a bus right outside the door for $1.70. We went on a day trip to Featherdale Wildlife Park and found it very convenient to have the hotel located right beside Central Train Station. I would recommend booking an airport shuttle from the airport. We found out when we arrived at Sydney Airport that we should have booked one in advance. A taxi cost $30 between us. On the return trip, we made the mistake of taking the train to the airport, since the station was right outside our door. It cost more than the shuttle ($13.80 vs $12.00) and there was no elevator to the platform at our end of the station.

My partner and I stayed at the there over the weekend following a business conference on Friday. The hotel staff were fantastic and during check-in on Friday morning i mentioned we had a late flight out of Sydney on Sunday night and they immediately offered a free late check-out! We were given a room on the 5th floor which had a double bed and very large LCD TV. Also had small bathroom with shower/bath and basic hygiene products (soap/body-wash/ shampoo/conditioner etc). As I was running late for a business meeting the concierge had a cab waiting downstairs for us after we dropped off our bags. Upon returning to the hotel that evening we decided to inquire about upgrading our room for the weekend as we rarely get away and wanted to make the most of it. The staff were really helpful and offered us an upgrade to a balcony room with city view on the 12th floor for only $40 a night! Gus the concierge was very helpful as we went to collect our bags from our first room and move to our new room. The new room was slightly larger, had a queen sized bed, more cupboard space and fridge with kettle and basic tea/coffee supplies. The balcony was a decent size and the view was much nicer than the wall we had been previously facing. Bathroom and TV were the same. Both rooms however were really clean, comfy and had lovely soft sheets and pillows. We really enjoyed getting breakfast delivered to our room each morning. We would just fill in the card at night saying what we wanted and the next morning at the specified time they would bring you a lovely tray with hot cooked breakfast. Prices were really reasonable (about $10 each), however i can't say the same for the rest of the room service menu which was very over-priced. You didn't need to go far to get great food though. Chinatown is on the doorstep, Darling Harbour is a 5 min walk away and Central station is also right outside so the location is really fantastic!

It seems that a lot of airlines use this hotel for their aircrew as I've always seem plenty of flight attendants waiting in the lobby (it's pretty close to the airport actually, but still in a good spot in the city). Although the location is perfect for public transportation (train is a 5-10minute walk underground and buses are all around) and only a 5 minute walk to Chinatown/Darling Harbour, you'll be better off staying further in midtown Sydney (perhaps at Avillon, World Square, or places nearby.
