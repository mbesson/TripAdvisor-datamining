From the outside the Raglan looks a bit more up-market than the Roseview further down the road and yet behind the ostentacious facade the 2 hotels are very similar. THE COST We booked the Raglan through Hotels.com and got a 10% discount on the room rate. For 2 nights we paid \u00c2\u00a3135.00 instead of \u00c2\u00a3150.00. We had to pay \u00c2\u00a38.95 each for full English breakfast (\u00c2\u00a335.80 for 4). Altogether the cost for the room for 2 nights and 4 breakfasts came to \u00c2\u00a3170.80. THE ROOM We were given room 221 which was located on the second floor. Those with mobility problems need to be aware that there is no lift and many stairs. The stair carpet had seen better days in some areas, as did the overall decor on the stairs and landings. The room itself was tiny, and the walls were paper thin, you could hear people in the room above. It was well decorated, but not much room to move in. The dressing table was small and cluttered with all manner of things so it left little space for your own stuff. The bed was comfy but only a double (we are used to a kingsize), and the duvet had seen better days, it was thin.The bed linen was spotlessly clean, and there were 4 plump pillows. Towels in the spotlessly clean shower room were fluffy and white. Complimentary toiletries were also supplied. THE BREAKFAST Breakfast was good. Fresh juices, cereals, toast, lots of fresh coffee, tea etc, and the cooked Full English was good. It really did set us up for the day. Breakfast we would give full marks. One nice touch was when we were leaving we were given a couple of cookies and bottles of water for our journey home. Overall The Raglan is a decent hotel to stay at, it is clean with pleasant and courteous staff, and the breakfast is good. Whether it justifies its cost over that of the Roseview, as well as its rating of a 3 star 'boutique' hotel is questionable.

First impression were excellent, very friendly staff on front desk. But then we ended up having a really bad experience so will never be back. Our stay ended up in an argument with manager, will detail this below. I'll list the good points first - friendly welcome, clean rooms, comfy bed. Then the bad - - Despite booking nearly 2 months in advance, we were given a small, dark, ground floor room facing a wall. Thought early bookings tended to get first pick of good rooms? - Thin walls, could hear conversations and bathroom noises from neighbour. - Fan in bathroom kept making loud noise for an hour after turning off so kept us awake. And then the worst thing was that we missed out on breakfast due to miscommunication, and were treated VERY rudely by staff. It's pretty simple, you sign in at reception, pay for breakfast in advance, and the form gives accurate breakfast times. I just glanced at it, so later when we got back to hotel from concert I asked the girl when breakfast ended. She said 10.30am. Then in the morning I double checked the info folder in the room, it also said 10.30am. So at 10:15am we went to dining room and were told it was over at 10am. Queried this at reception, and they confirmed it was 10am. I said I'd been told different and wasn't impressed. All they needed to do was say \"sorry about the confusion, we'll refund the money for breakfast now.\" Instead, they got annoyed at me, pointed out extremely patronisingly that I had signed the form with the time of 10am stated on it. I said that wasn't really the point at all, could I get my money back? She didn't want to do it!!! I asked for the manager, he started repetitively lecturing me also. I said I was sick of hearing the same thing repeated, and that was no way to talk to a guest. \"Just refund the money please so we can leave...\". He just had to point out one more time that it said 10am on the form I signed. I was FURIOUS by this stage. What is it with customer service people who want to have the last word?? In conclusion, I did get my refund. Then went back to my room, grabbed the folder of hotel info that CLEARLY stated 10.30am and took it back to them as we exited.

The breakfast plate was warm and on the second morning so was the food, I opted for the museli then changed my mind as I think it was sawdust. The tea was an interesting shade of grey.

I do not think any of them are familiar with the concept of service and that when dealing with customers you operate on the basis that you the hotel may be at fault until you sort it out. They argued and argued that we had not already paid even though I knew I had seen it on our credit card statement and were vehement in their insistence that it was a pre-authorisation. Finally we were in the poky little room after hauling bags up a cramped shabby staircase and corridor relieved to be away from the AWFUL receptionist when she knocked on the door. I was so upset by this point I told them to go away the knocking persisted and I finally went to the door. Faced yet again with the awful receptionist and an events manager who said the general manager was unavailable but would speak to us both the following morning and that our room for the evening would be complimentary but not the champagne and flowers we had ordered for our room. We were staying in a family room the following night with our children to spend time with our friends in London. We went out for the evening and thankfully had a great time at the concert but stayed out as late as we could to avoid going back to the hotel. We met the manager the following morning who was superficially sympathetic and quite charming but refused my request for the receptionist to sit in on the chat with us as I wanted to speak to her about her behaviour the previous day. We did not have to pay for the room on our wedding night but did for the family room on the Sunday. He invited us to return to the hotel as complimentary guests for the weekend I feel however this was merely to ensure we paid for the room on the Sunday evening and was not a sincere offer. The housekeeper at the hotel was lovely and the only genuine member of staff we had any dealings with. When we arrived home I checked our credit card statement and we had indeed already paid for the room. We raised this with the manager Thomas on the phone - again we were told it was a pre-authorisation and our card had not been debited. He then refused to respond to further e-mails and said he would do nothing unless he could see our credit statement. There was no offer to check his own records or look into it at their end he insisted he would do nothing without our credit card statment. After the treatment and behaviour we had already received at their hands we were unwilling to do this. We had to raise a dispute with our credit card company and received a refund from them. Needless to say we have not pursued his disingenuous offer of a complimentary stay.", "Date": "December 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cawful!\u201d", "Author": "sue032", "ReviewID": "UR22075536", "Content": "I booked a single room for one night in this \"fashionable\"hotel.I certainly will not be returning.I found the hotel to be very shabby,the carpet in the corridor leading to the rooms was ruttled up and in need of a good clean.I eventually found my room up two flights of stairs(no lift)down the far end of the hotel and through several doors.It was what I can only describe as a cupboard,it was so tiny ,.It was above the kitchen so I heard banging all evening and outside my window was a large funnel where all the smells and steam were coming from the sushi restaurant downstairs.

Booked the hotel as we were going to a concert at Ally Pally. Arrived to a highly polished marble reception area and booked in. Ordered a couple of Sunday morning papers and made our way up to our room. The door off the reception looked 'shabby', we opened it and climbed up a 'shabby' badly fitted brown carpet. My heart started to sink. Got to our freezing cold room. What a strange room, looked like was half way through a refurb and the money ran out. The double bed was tiny in length (my 6ft 4' husbands legs hung out the end all night!) and there was no valence covering the bottom part of it, which took my eyes down to the carpet, yuk! The carpet and the curtains were just hideous...reminded me of a dreadful flat I lived in about 20 years ago that was furnished by the landlord. The bath room had a disgusting pink shower curtain hanging around the bath which matched the equally awful dated tiles on the walls (including the cracked ones), When we left the concert we decided to go back to the hotel for a few drinks, the main bar was closed and we were directed to the empty sushi restaurant (part of the hotel) and had a beer each, as they don't sell shorts in here. Another couple came into the bar about 5 mins after us (by this time it was 11.15 on a Sat night) they were told that the bar was now shut!! As we went up to our room another chap was clearly annoyed and complaining about both the hotel bars being shut (by then about 11.30). Breakfast was OK, but not what you expect these days from a decent hotel, there was no buffet spread/croissants or fruit etc. Instead you had to choose from a choice of three options..healthy (cereals etc) cooked or something else.

I stayed with the Raglan last week and I must say how pleased I was. I understand they are under new management and since I stayed there last summer the improvement is immense. They have spent a lot of money on the reception, bar and gargens and I really felt warm and comfortable there. The food is 5 star and it was nice to see the same staff there from the last time. I was given a large room facing the front and was happy to see double glazed windows and fresh sheets in a newly refurbished room. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT but I had a room with a television in the bathroom on the second night as I got a free upgrade. There is a concierge who went out and got me a bag of sweets and his help on carrying my bags and getting things for me and the ability to have room service allowed me to be non sociable. I used to write for the Newport Gazette on hotels and bars and I am giving an 8.5 out of 10 as I never give a ten and I am basing this on a three star. I will be staying at this hotel again and a word of advice-try the cocktails in the bar.", "Date": "April 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "shropshire", "Title": "\u201ceverything we needed!\u201d", "Author": "salopians", "ReviewID": "UR7427685", "Content": "Our son chose Raglan Hall as the venue for his recent wedding.

The hotel staff were at all times friendly and very helpful, sorting all requests quickly - nothing seemed to be too much trouble. The food was excellent and very good value for money. The bar was a good evening venue for the younger guests, with cocktails available and a DJ. The well laid out garden-patio was a great bonus on a warm, sunny afternoon.

The room we were in was filthy: -had what looked like bloodstains on the walls and floors; -the carpet and skirting boards were covered in stains, as was the bathroom floor, and there were lots of cobwebs in the bedroom and bathroom; - the extractor fan in the bathroom didn't work (but this was ok, as one pane of the bathroom window was smashed and the window didn't close properly anyway, so we got a lot of ventilation!); - the UHT milk in the tea/coffee basket had gone off, and was more like cheese (I have no idea how long it takes for UHT milk to go off, but I'm sure it must take a while!); - the bedding was stained; - there was no hot water in the shower; - the free movies as stated on the website didn't exist. I informed the recptionist of all of these, and suggested we should get a fairly hefty refund. She offered \u00c2\u00a310 (just more than 10%) and said she wouldn't give me anymore, as it would come out of her wages!! There was no manager in the building, and no way of contacting one for me to speak to. The cooked buffet breakfast was rather good, but only because we got there well in advance of the closing time of 10am. Our friends who got to the breakfast room at 9:45/9:50 to find no cooked breakfast left on the buffet table were told that there would be no further food cooked, and that the staff had other things to do, (although after complaining they eventually got some food.) I took solace from the fact that I wasn't the only one to have a rotten time, as there were plenty of people (mainly our friends) at reception, all complaining, when I left! I am still awaiting a phone call from the manager.....

I had seen that the Raglan had been recently refubished and was impressed with the facade and so booked in for 3 nights over the telephone for my latest trip. Upon my arrival, I found that I was not expected but fortunately they had a room vacant. As I started to climb the stairs, I thought that I had been caught in a time warp as nothing 'behind the shop front' had changed. Awful decor, every floorboard creaks - very 1980's seaside B&B. The room, classed as a double was a single with a double bed shoe-horned into it, the sink was cracked and shower fitments were hanging off. I was told that the room was at the back and quiet. It was at the front, not particularly noisy but the curtain didn't fit the small window and so I was woken each morning by the sun about 90 minutes before my alarm sounded. The cheapest meal in the restaurant is about \u00c2\u00a316. Breakfast is completely self-service (no eggs this morning) and surley looking waitresses manage to wipe and set tables around you avoiding eye contact with everyone in case they may have to be pleasant. The bar is nite-club dim. No prices are displayed but beers are about \u00c2\u00a31 dearer than the place next door (rooms are \u00c2\u00a310 per night dearer). The bar staff pour spirits without using measures and you can only have doubles (50ml). In reality, you pay over the odds for a double measure but actually get whatever the barman guesses is enough. One barman thought that it was OK to put ice into a crusher with his fingers straight after handling money. In short, don't be fooled by the glass, mirrors, halogen lights and plasma TVs that you can see from the street; they are just bait dangled to entice you in.", "Date": "August 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "Nlordship415", "ReviewID": "UR5300797", "Content": "I booked the Hotel for my brother and parents.
