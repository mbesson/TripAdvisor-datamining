REfund refused when asked given we were rushed in the lift by 17 drunken idiots... had to get manager on phone, tried to leave after one hour and refund refuse again...eventually threatened to call health inspectors and refund for two nights given after four hours!!!!

Just coming from NZ where we stayed at another hostel/hotel type of place called Jucy Hotel, we were hoping for the best. The room smelled funny and was quite dirty. There was not a single piece of furniture in the room that wasn't chipped or ugly. No window.

The location is really good and only a 5 minute walk to the shops and 15 minute walk to the Harbour. The place is massive with hundreds of rooms. We had a twin but were moved twice during our stay firstly because of maintainance then because our room was booked after the 3rd night. It is a party hostel and the Irish lads that work there sort out events and nights out. It is generally a friendly place and we met loads of people within the first hour of being there and were playing drinking games, but don't expect a quiet relaxing time. There are lots of people in the hostel that \\re long term residents, mostly gap year travellers, but there are also a few asylum seeker types there. We stayed during the world cup and tried to go to bed before the England v USA game which started at 4.30am, but we were sadly mistaken if we thought we were going to get any sleep as some of the Irish residents decided to play IRA rebel music at full blast til about 3.30am. There is a large TV room and the kitchen areas were usually clean and looked after. The free breakfast is toast and when we stayed some type of wierd stew. This is a good hostel to stay if you are the party / outgoing type but don't stay here if you want a quiet relaxing time with good views!!", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAwesome way to meet people and party!\u201d", "Author": "torcht", "ReviewID": "UR59910244", "Content": "It's a definitely a get what you pay for type of place when it comes to the rooms, but while I was there I was never in the rooms and the staff was awesome for showing people around and giving advice.

Straight up GROSS! I stayed here on my first trip to Sydney back in April for 4 nights, and this is the 2nd worst hostel I have stayed in (the worst one is City Resort in Kings X, but I won't go into depth on this review). This place was BAD BAD BAD from the get-go. The guy at the desk didn't have my reservation, so I had to show him the transaction went through on my credit card statement to get our room my mate and I shared. We traveled in a crew of about 7 or 8 people, and all of us thought this place was a nasty poo hole. I don't want to start on the bathrooms. The shower basically had to pee cold water on me for 20 min to even get my hair wet, and I about slipped on a big puddle of puke/poo walking in to the bathroom, which took the staff a couple of days to clean up. Our rooms were absolute and total crap! There was no power outlet in our room, our chair has this disgusting pea green stain on it (who knows what it was), the mattresses were not comfortable (it was like sleeping on a bed frame). Our door didn't lock properly (nothing got stolen), and the room just flat out stunk. There was one tiny window you can peer out of, but that's about it. The only positive note is the great location. There's a Cole's supermarket about 5 min. up the street, so you can cook/buy brekky for chips. There are also HEAPS of good bars around the area, and also a Harry's DeWheels Meat Pie Stand is about a 5 to 10 min walk S. of the hotel off of George St., so you don't have to go all the way to Potts Pt. If you travel to Sydney, you HAVE to have one of Harry's famous pies! (Get peppered beef with mashies on top!) Basically, all of my mates had the same complaints I did-disgusting rooms, hurt backs, horrid bathrooms, no hot water, and no feelings our things being safe in our room. I expected one night to come back from drinking and to have all of my stuff gone out of my room. THIS HOSTEL IS WHAT WE ALL REMEMBER ABOUT OUR TRIP TO SYDNEY! If you've NEVER stayed in a hostel, I would have to say this would not be a first one to go to. Check out the YHA on George St. It's HEAPS better!!! I would rather camp out at Darling Harbour or up by the opera house on a bench than sleep here for a night!", "Date": "January 29, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Nomads Maze Hotel Sydney", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d1211394-Reviews-Nomads_Maze_Hotel_Sydney-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "Price": "$27 - $74*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">417 Pitt Street 2000</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Sydney</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">New South Wales</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">2000</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Australia</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1211394", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/6e/a7/6ea7fdab80ea610cb9117c19fe23728d1large.jpg"}}
