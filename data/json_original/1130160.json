This is a very, very old place (I'm guessing built in the 1940s). While it was relatively clean and the bed was OK, the wall heater did not really work and we needed to get a space heater, the faucets in the bathroom wash basin either trickled water or blasted the water (clausing water to go on the floor and wall), there is noise in the alley in back of the hotel at night and in the early morning the dump trucks arrived, etc. It served our purpose of being convenient to the hospital for an early morning medical procedure, but if you're looking for a comfortable modern place for a vacation while in Seattle, look elsewhere. Rate was $116 per night - rather pricey for a hotel of this quality.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Character Find\u201d", "Author": "kristye28", "ReviewID": "UR120237119", "Content": "We were four friends from Vancouver heading down to Seattle wanting to stay downtown and pay as little as possible for a clean, safe place to stay.

The Baroness lobby is as old fashioned as it gets with a large fireplace and nice woodwork. The elevator is an experience. The door opens like a regular swinging door, and then it groans and creeks all the way to your floor. There are honest to goodness real keys for the rooms, and the doors appear to be the original oak. The rooms are clean but small, the bed old, and the bathrooms serviceable but with the original fixtures. There is no air conditioning in the rooms, and the windows do not have screens, so it was a warm night for my wife and me. If you want nostalgia stay at the Baroness. If you want a nice night in a decent hotel, pick something else.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cBEWARE...HORRIBLE SERVICE\u201d", "Author": "ExpressTravel1234", "ReviewID": "UR72908756", "Content": "I had made reservations 3 weeks in advance. I purposely arrived later ~7pm to allow for extra time for the room to be ready. When I arrived the front desk stated that several guests had wanted to extend their stay and that did not have a room for me. I had traveled cross country and NO attempt had been made to contact me via phone, email, etc. They refused to pay for a hotel in the area stating that they were too expensive. They did call and find me a room at a VERY shady part of town located about 15 miles away from the convention center right off I5. The main reason that I choose to stay at The Baroness was due to it's close proximity to downtown. The desk clerk was had not be trained to deal with this type of situation and the manager basically left her on her own to deal with me and the other guests that were being turned away. You may be lured in by the more moderate pricing compare to hotels in the area but it will not be worth the difference in cost for the potential hassle.", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cThe Baroness is very nostalgic.\u201d", "Author": "Piano913", "ReviewID": "UR63112794", "Content": "It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like you walked back in time to the early 1900\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.

I stayed here on a weekend so didn't have to deal with the construction noise.They did however ensure to mention that it can be noisy during the week at the time of booking. The room itself consisted of a kitchenette complete with cooker/oven,fridge freezer and microwave,a small living room,a bedroom and a tiny bathroom.It was clean but not modern-it also doesn't have air conditioning. Basically i wanted a inexpensive clean,comfortable place to stay for a weekend of exploring Seattle and that's what i got. If you are looking for pure luxury this is not for you. Staff were friendly and helpful. It's located close to downtown and capitol hill- Be warned that the hotel is at the top of an extremely steep hill I'd definitely stay here again as the rates were low compared to other hotels and it was comfortable", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGross\u201d", "Author": "OnToTheNextTrip", "ReviewID": "UR18733675", "Content": "A single night in Seattle was made incredibly unpleasant by staying at The Baroness. The building lobby was under renovation and the area was very noisy beginning at 6:30 a.m. There is no air conditioning at the hotel and we were given a fan to help cool off the room on a day that was 32C/90F. The rooms are old and dingy and only the lobby is currently being renovated. The price may be low compared to other hotels in downtown Seattle, but it was not a bargain given what poor shape the hotel is in. Parking costs an additional $13 and is located a block away. Walking back to the hotel from the parking garage would be very difficult for someone who is not in good physical shape since there is quite a hill between them.
