Friendly staff, excellent exercise facilities, business facilities, laundry room and hot breakfast in the morning made me feel like I was staying at some kind of futuristic bed and breakfast.

I travel with therapy dogs and prefer LQ's, generally. This facility is beautiful, lovely grounds, easy to find and very spiffy. Customer service is missing in action. I had reserved a king single was given a single queen with a single side chair (think kitchen chair, here) as the only place to sit in the room other than the bed. The room reeked of carpet adhesive. I stood at the check-in counter for twenty minutes while the clerk was busy on the phone. After much prompting, he finally placed a call to 'someone.' In front of me he said, 'there is some woman complaining.' The lack of caring at this LQ was absolute. They absolutely do NOT care. Three weeks later, after complaining to corporate level customer 'service' I received a call from a manager. They 'gave' me a credit of 1000 points. Still waiting for that to show up. . Of interest, some of the dogs who stayed here during the Dallas Dog Show became ill, rashes, sneezing, lots of itching. One wonders about the carpet and cleaning solutions or adhesive? It smells strongly of 'new' carpeting..", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cBEST La Quinta We've Stayed In\u201d", "Author": "Moonette", "ReviewID": "UR122385518", "Content": "If you read my reviews, you'll notice we've stayed at a LOT of LQs. When we drive somewhere, we have our dog with us, and LQs take pets. That said, this was the absolute BEST La Quinta we've ever stayed in. Yes, it's brand new, but we've stayed in other new hotels that were not as nice. This LQ was clean, bright, and comfortable. . . The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed we've stayed in in a long time. I liked that there was wood laminate flooring inside the door of the room. (I wish American hotels would use laminate throughout the room . . . much more sanitary.) The bathroom was more upscale than other LQs. The furniture and carpet were quite contemporary. The only glitch was that the breakfast attendant forgot to turn on the waffle iron, so we had no waffles that morning. :-( No big deal. There are other choices. All-in-all, a great experience. If I had to go to Dallas on business, I'd choose this hotel even if I didn't have a dog with me.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santorini, Greece", "Title": "\u201cBest La Qunita I've ever seen\u201d", "Author": "Tony D", "ReviewID": "UR121764632", "Content": "Ive been to several la Qunita's across the nation and i've never seen one this clean.
