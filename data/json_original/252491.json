My girlfriend and I spent 3 nights of our 10 day tour of the Yucatan at Hotel Posada Freud. We stayed in a suite on the 2nd level looking out onto 5th ave, furthest away from the neighboring restaurant/bar. Here are the good things about the hotel and room. It is located in a great location on 5th ave. If you like \u201cpeople watching\u201d the suite facing 5th ave is great for that. The suite has good A/C system and ceiling fan that cools the room quickly and has a fridge. We found it to be a reasonable price, $85. (The price ranges of places we stayed on our trip were from $40-$100) Posada Freud fell in the middle. The balcony is larger than most on 5th ave. It has room for a table, two chairs and a hammock. The suite next to us, closest to the neighboring restaurant/bar, has a very large balcony for Playa standards, probably twice the size of ours. We looked at both suites and selected the one furthest away from the restaurant/bar because it was quieter. That said, you can still easily hear the restaurant/bar music and it does have great live bands which we listened to on our balcony each night before going out. The hotel also has a small bar of its own where the bartenders also serve as the hotel staff. The staff was very friendly in both roles as hotel reception and bartenders. The maid service was good. There are two minor criticisms about the hotel and one very problematic one, which is why the title of this review is \"Unfortunate Ending.\" First the minor criticisms, the shower water is difficult to achieve a nice medium between hot and cold, and the hot water only lasted about 7-10 minutes. It was sunny and hot in Playa anyway, so this wasn't a huge deal for us, but may be for others. The other minor criticism is that you can feel the springs in the bed through the cushion. We remedied this by sleeping on top of the supplemental blankets that were provided in the room, but the bed was still not very comfortable. One night I slept outside in the hammock, but I did that mostly for the novelty of it and because I had a few cervesas and thought it would be a good idea at the time, not really to avoid the bed. Before describing our \"Unfortunate Ending,\" I want mention one of the funniest things that I have seen in my 3 trips to Mexico that happened at Hotel Posada Freud. On the second night of our stay three Mexican guys who said they were finishing up a business trip rented the suite next to us with the huge balcony for two days. These guys were very friendly, had a huge bottle of tequila which must have been 3 feet tall (just less than 1 meter) and were hitting it pretty hard. My girlfriend and I talked with them for while over the balcony and then went out dinner. Before we left our new neighbors were calling down over the balcony to mariachi bands requesting songs. We left and went to dinner. We got back to the hotel about 2 hours later and our neighbors had drank about \u00bc of the huge bottle of tequila and now had a full blown mariachi band on their balcony singing their crazy Mexican songs. It was hilarious! The band was up there for hours and it probably would have been annoying later b/c they were so loud, but I had enough cervesas so it didn\u2019t matter. This was also the same night I slept in the hammock . . . OK, so as described in the title, our stay at Hotel Posada Freud had an unfortunate ending. On the last night of our stay, the night before we were flying back home, we went to bed \u201cearly\u201d around 10pm. At about midnight I woke up and told my girlfriend that I felt like I was being bit. It was dark in the room, and I first thought it was probably a mosquito, but the pain was much greater that a typical mosquito bite. As I was lying in the bed deciding whether to get up, I felt another painful bite so I got up to kill this \u201cmosquito.\u201d When I turned on the lights what I saw was disgusting. Ants were everywhere! These ants were large \u00bd inch in size (1.25 cm) and I estimate there were 50+ ants crawling around the floor of the suite. They were in the main bedroom area as well as the bathroom. I started to kill them but then realized my efforts were fruitless, there were too many. These ants were not hovering around a food source or in an ant line like you normally see them. These ants were just scattered at random throughout the floor running in all directions. I did not see any ants in the bed after I turned on the lights, but can only presume that the ants are what bit me. I took off my shirt and looked in the mirror; I had two large bite marks on my back, each about 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter. I showed them to my girlfriend who gasped at my marks. I told my girlfriend that we needed to check out immediately, by this time it was about 12:15am. She began to pack our things and I went down to the reception desk. I explained the ant problem to the desk clerk. I told him that I either wanted to switch rooms or check out. He offered me the room next to mine, the one right next to the restaurant/bar with the live music. I knew that if we switched the music would prohibit us from sleeping and I did not trust that if there was an ant problem in our room that there would not be one in the room next to us. I asked to pay for our prior nights and to check out. I told the clerk I did not want to pay for the current night. He refused and said that since he could not rent the room at 12am that I had to pay for it. I protested his point and he asked if I had left food out in the room. None, I said. 100% of any small food items we had were kept in the fridge and we were extremely neat about cleaning up after we had eaten. (I am a property manager for a living and know full well the concerns of food and pests.) He then asked to see the ants in our room. I showed him the room and the ants that I had killed, but by this time there no living ants crawling around anymore as they likely crawled into crevices when the lights were turned on. He said he couldn\u2019t see any ants and went down stairs to his reception desk. He again stated that he would have to charge me for the current night. I protested again and showed him my bite marks. He asked if I would be willing to speak with the owner. I told him I was perfectly willing to do this. He called someone, I presume the owner, and came back a few minutes later and said that I could pay for previous nights and could check out, no payment required for the current night. I never spoke with the owner. I paid him for the prior nights and checked out. On my way out the door the reception clerk apologized to me for the ants and told me that the building is treated for pests. We walked over to a nearby hotel and checked in there just before 1am. The rest of night was fine. We had seen a rogue ant here and there during the first few days of our stay at Hotel Posada Freud, but those I just killed them, no big deal. It was the large quantity of ants on our last night and the fact that I was being bit that caused us to leave. It was very peculiar and I have no idea why the ants came out in such large numbers on the last night of our trip. Had it not been for the ants on the last night I would have been satisfied with our stay, but when I look for a hotel room, the two basic things that are most important to me is that it is clean and free of pests. Since the basic need of keeping a room free of pests was not met, any and all other positive aspects of the hotel, to me, are moot. Because of this I will not be staying at Hotel Posada Freud in the future and caution any other travelers who are considering a stay there.", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Find\u201d", "Author": "levi760", "ReviewID": "UR94333139", "Content": "My wife and I are in our mid-20s and try to take a trip about every 6 months.

As it turned out this was a perfect match for us as the Posada Freud is right in the center spot of Playa, meaning close to the beach, bars and restaurants we enjoyed so much. Moreover, we love the character of this small hotel which we prefer to the huge and (in our view) anonymous all-inclusive tourist-towers we saw all over the coast of this beautiful peninsula. Our room was clean and very charming - it had AC, a fridge and a nice balcony. Concerning the noise issue: In contrast to some other reviewers we even enjoyed the bars and the live music next to the hotel which added up to our vacation feeling. Sure, this depends on individual needs - but in a holiday, in that kind of a city, we prefer not to go to sleep before midnight anyway. When trying to have a quiet and peaceful holiday I am not exactly sure if I would decide for Playa at all as it is the vibrating life is which makes this city so attractive. Anyway, what made our stay complete (and the reason for my first tripadvisor review) was the help of the hotel owner Christine. She is originally from Austria and therefore speaks German. She was very helpful in giving us advice and tips for our trip through Yucatan demonstrating a huge amount of local knowledge and pointing out some nice beaches, cenotes, maya-sites and so forth, which was a big help for us. We even returned to the Posada Freud in the middle of our trip on our way back up towards the Isla de Mujeres (recommendation!). We were suprised that our second double-room looked almost completely different, again having a very charmful atmosphere.

The penthouse is amazing! It was so big, we could have comfortably added a few more people and still never get in each others way. The penthouse is designed and decorated very uniquely. You will truly feel at home from the moment you arrive. The location of this hotel cannot be beat. Although the penthouse has a kitchen, which I planned on using for cooking meals, I never did use it once. The restaurants readily available in Playa Del Carmen quickly changed my mind about cooking. The food choices were plentiful, excellent and so convenient with hardly a walk to each favorite restaurant. But, in the event someone did want to cook in the kitchen, it was equipped nicely and was clean. My family and I have been traveling between Cancun, Playa Del Carmen and Cozumel for many years. I believe this was our 49th or 50th trip. Each of us has our own preferences on how to spend our time while on vacation. The location of the Posada Freud made it possible for each person to do what they wanted, and easily meet up at the bar without feeling like we were waiting on each other all week. There was no hassle of taking a taxi every time you wanted to go to dinner or to come home late at night after partying at a club. Some may think that the noise level is an issue while staying right on the 5th. If you are a person who needs absolute quiet to sleep, and you like to be in bed sleeping before midnight, then maybe you should invest in a cheap pair or earplugs. Personally, I found the live music from the club next door to be a great addition to my vacation. The music was wonderful and it added to my experience. I enjoyed relaxing on the terrace and having drinks with family and friends while being entertained by the live band. The staff at the Posada Freud are very friendly and helpful for any situation. From the moment you meet them, you feel appreciated and welcomed. The feeling of a smaller hotel cannot be beat when the staff know your name and greet you with a smile every time you return to your room. The staff are helpful with any request. While we were vacationing, Mexico had record breaking cold weather. The owners of the hotel brought extra blankets to us to be sure we were warm at night. I cannot wait for another vacation to the Posada Freud. After traveling to Mexico many times, staying in many types of hotels, I have finally found the one I will return to time and time again. I would be comfortable staying in a smaller room if I were to travel alone or with another person. But, if vacationing with a group, I would certainly ask for the penthouse once again. It feels like a special get-away home tucked into the trees. The only people I would not recommend this room for is anyone who may have a broken leg in a full cast. The stairs may be difficult for you to climb... for for anyone else, go for it! You will not regret it.

I've found the staff and owners to be polite, friendly, honest and helpful in every instance. This is not a foo foo hotel. If you require monogramed linnen, bathrobes, irons at a moments notice, and a tuxedo wait staff that trips over themselves to wait on your every whim, you are better off at one of the many heartless mega resorts that line the resort strip. This is an honest family run hotel offering a safe beautiful place to stay for a reasonable rate. If a washcloth is not delivered to your room in seconds, are you really going to let it ruin your stay? Relax, you are in Mexico. Is it noisy at night? Sure. The bar next door plays carribean Cubano music or live acoustic guitar until midnight some nights. I rarely grow tired of the music but if have to sleep earplugs are an easy fix. In fifteen years, I've never had a problem with the honesty of the maid staff. If I leave any money around it is always placed in a cup or bowl on the counter for my return. Try Posada Freud. You will like it.", "Date": "August 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cPosada Freud Rocks!!!!\u201d", "Author": "johnattwell", "ReviewID": "UR38377633", "Content": "If you are going to Playa del Carmen...give Posada Freud serious consideration....we thought it was the perfect location....right on 5th Ave where all the restaurants, bars, stores and all the fun in Playa is, in addition to being near the beach.

I read the reviews from posada and decided to give it a shot, especially since I heard good things about the suite. Booking was a breeze, email, paypal...done! Got the every so popular suite #5 for 5 nights. Check-in was at about 2 I think and there was a guy sitting in a chair outside and we were in our room in less than 30 seconds. Room was everything you needed. Nice ceramic tile floors, AC, Cable TV, big shower ( although water pressure was a little off but hey its mexico) and big bed with the all notorious rock hard mattress but again...its mexico. The best was the balcony where two french doors open to. There is a hammock where we spent some time napping and the view is great for people watching centrally located on 5th in between 8th and 10th. The room was cleaned everyday by I'd say 3pm and of course we left a couple bucks a day for tip which in turn gets you a spotless room and a nice towel animal...very nice! As far as everyone talking about the noise...yes siesta fiesta is next door but it didnt bother us and the suite is the only room that is open to the front of 5th ave. The sun and margaritas beat us up so bad that we were in bed sound asleep by midnight or so every night and as far as people saying there are mariachi bands playing in the morning or music...we woke up around 10am everyday to go to the beach and people were just opening their shops so again no noise here. Grounds were kept immaculate with a nice courtyard and two family chiuauas running around checkout was easy and a smooth walk to the ADO which by the way is the easiest and cheapest way to get to playa.

From the bar beside until 2 am, and from the street as of 7 am (shops opening, a busy cafe is just in front of the hotel etc). So we got almost no sleep during a week-end which was suppost to be for recharging batteries. If you come to Playa to party and need a hotel just to shower, this is the place as the location is good. However I think you can find a shower for less money. And beware, my room atleast had very little hot water so your showers will be cold! Also the cleanliness of the room had a lot to wish for, and the bathroom built into the corner of the room half open would not be very comfortable if you are not staying alone in the room as it provides no privacy. Also I felt that the room lacked maintenance (fosets leaking, shower blocked so you stood in dirty water while showering, riped sheets etc). No, no, no...

We turned left up 5th, and started walking. Our first order of business was to find a room. We happened upon a discrete little boutique hotel, it was Posada Freud. We decided instantly to check in. (I would not try this plan during peak season) Being adventurous, we figured we would stay here for a night or two, until we found something else. As it was our first time in Playa, we really didn\u2019t know what that \u201csomething else\u201d was. In the end, we never left. The rooms, service, location and atmosphere was so wonderful, we new this was it. The reception area was quaint clean and friendly. As we headed to our room, we passed through the rod iron gates and into a small paradise. Large trees created a comfortable cool canopy of shade, and the small gardens were vibrant and immaculate. Our room was large and obviously well prepared and cared for. That evening we discovered one of the best things of all. While cozied up together in our large hammock, enjoying some cold beer and tequila that we stocked in our fridge and watching the little chirping geckos hunting for the occasional moth on our even larger balcony, we heard the firs tunings of a live band. Next door is a little bar that plays live covers until midnight. It became our nightly ritual after dinner and exploring, to cozy up and listen to the tunes and enjoy each others company. After 22 years and 4 kids those times are rare indeed. On subsequent trips we have gone back to make it our base of operations while exploring the Yucatan region. Posada Freud is a 3 min walk to the beach, and located so that you are instantly in the middle of all the shopping and dining you could ever want. They will assist and recommend you in getting tours of all the local sights and activities, or you can go to one of the many tour coordinator booths steps from your room. We have met many good friends and had many good times at their quaint little bar. Edguardo and his lovely wife are the owners, and proudly talk about their place while happily sharing a drink with you. In the end, we have found a home away from home. If you are the all inclusive type, Posada Freud is probably not for you, but if you are the type that enjoys friends and exploring a culture and all of its wonders from a place that feels like home; you could not ask for better.

It is so economical and yet so comfortable that it was incredibly worth it. I felt like I was in someone's home! And since I decided to make that stay on a whim, I was in a position to actually experience a lot of different rooms, because I hadn't made advanced reservations in one specific room. So most of my mornings I'd check out and move to another room. They were so super accommodating, always keeping my bags secure in the office when I checked out and helping me move to my new room when I returned.

Even the ones without A/C (7 and 9) were really fine in my opinion...as these rooms are decked out with great, high powered fans to help keep it cool. And who stays indoors anyways except to sleep! Last but not least, the best part, is the cute hotel lobby bar. It is the center of gravity. It's so perfect, especially for solo travelers like me to meet new people (or in my case, practice my Spanish and do homework at the bar with Michael, the bartender, Carlos and Aldo! ---over a few Coronas). These were some of my most fun and favorite nights. :) So on the whole, I highly, highly recommend this place. And would be willing to be contacted by fellow travelers if you have any questions about staying here. I WILL RETURN TO POSADA FREUD! No doubt about it, on any and ALL my trips to Playa. :) Thanks to all that made my stay incredible.

First off check in was breeze and the staff were all very friendly and helpfull. It' s a low key laid back kind of place great to get into the flow of mexico, especially for us coming from NYC. We has a standard room and we opted for a/c. The room was nice and clean simply furnished and best of all we had a balcony with a hammock. All this for a price that would not break the bank even at christmas time. The location is great for being right in the middle of it all and there is bar downstairs for a relaxing drink as you watch the world go by. The bar next door can get pretty loud if you want to get to bed early it could be a problem. We were not bothered by it too much but we are used to allot of noise outside our windows. I might consider bringing ear plugs just in case when I return, some nights seem louder than others.", "Date": "January 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland", "Title": "\u201cBest value, Right on 5th avenue!\u201d", "Author": "OregonCountry", "ReviewID": "UR7927348", "Content": "We have stayed at Posada Freud twice now. The first time in 2006, we toured several hotels with our criteria being: within a block of 5th ave., within 2 blocks of the beach, nicest place for under $100. After looking at about a dozen hotels that fit this criteria, we settled on Posada Freud. The basic rooms are just that, basic. But the suites are very nice (tile floors, showers, countertops, nice furnishings, each room has a rustic balcony), plenty of room, air conditioned, very clean, all for about $65-70 per night! Also there is a penthouse with 3 bedrooms for $200 per night. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Maid service is excellent. Family owned establishment. Anyway, when we returned in 2007, we stayed our whole vacation there and loved every minute. For those of you who want a swimming pool, they are planning on putting a small pool in the back within a year. Also, they currently don't have TV's in the rooms, but are planning to add them also within a year. (I don't really know why people want to watch TV while in Mexico, or for that matter to swim in a pool when you are one block from the Carribean!) If you just want a clean room for cheap, there are cheaper places on 5th. If you want a nice place that won't cost a fortune, try Posada Freud!", "Date": "June 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cCharming\u201d", "Author": "bmohlman", "ReviewID": "UR7705184", "Content": "We are avid travelers to the area and have stayed in many budget hotels in the playa del carmen area. We backpacked here to check out Posada Freud and found it met our expectations and was honoring the off season rate of $37 a night with no a/c which was a good deal, so we stayed. The reviews are pretty true to the property. It is a comfortable, charming stay. One downfall is the noise of the bar band next door, but it didnt bother us since we were out till 1am. What did bother us was some man yelling to his wife from his balcony early in the morning. The other downfall was the shower curtain did not reach to the floor and water was all over the floor of the bathroom when I was done. The room was a groundfloor with screen doors and colorful decor with authentic Mexican taste. The garden area was tasteful with hammocks and seating. I would stay again for the price since it is one of the few hotels that remains in the $30 budget range and exceeds the expectations at that price.", "Date": "May 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat place, great value!\u201d", "Author": "gingele", "ReviewID": "UR6622131", "Content": "We were thrilled with Posada Freud.

Adorable room with a large king bed plus a second double bed, great balcony with hammock, chairs & table, nice sized bathroom, mini fridge, very clean, and great location right in the heart of things on Fifth. Had a/c but we never used it. Ceiling fan & patio doors worked like a champ. And all for under $70 a night in January! We were so thrilled we will be staying in the penthouse for our next family trip to Playa. Oh, and the noise? A non-issue for us. We actually enjoyed opening our baclony doors in the evenings as we showered & dressed for dinner to listen to the music from next door. We never had an issue after returning to our room after a night out. By then the live music would be finished and the place next door might still have some ambient music playing - but not anything that kept either one of us awake.
