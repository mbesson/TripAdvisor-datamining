The receptionist, seeing the kid, immediately told me he will cost extra. When asked why, since there is no surcharge for kids on their website, he said that information is \"old\", but I can pay the surcharge of 15 euros per night instead of 20. He demanded I pay outright. I was in no condition to argue, but only because I was very tired and had an important meeting in an hour at another end of Istanbul. But the worst of all was the room. It was 7 square metres ( 75 square feet), together with a bathroom! Literally half of the entire space was taken by an ordinary bed. The room was so small that there was not enough space for towel hooks in the bathroom - I had to hang them on the top of the sliding door. When I asked the reception that since I pay extra for the kid, could he at least upgrade us to a larger room, I was told there are no rooms available. I tried to book into the hotel using booking.com and found that at least 4 rooms were unbooked. Overall impression: unfriendly, misleading, terrible rip-off. In fairness, Wi-Fi connection was working OK, the room was clean when we arrived and cleaned next day, and breakfast quality was on par with Turkish budget hotels.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cInhospitable and Inconsistent\u201d", "Author": "pkt63", "ReviewID": "UR109829447", "Content": "We made a reservation with Sultan's Eye for 5 nights. On their website it clearly states in multiple places that a stay of at least 3 nights includes a free transfer from Ataturk Airport, which I requested along with the reservation. An associate emailed me back an said the transfer would be 25 Euros. I replied, pointing out their website policy and the next day a different person replied to me saying they know their website SAYS that, but in reality they are no longer offering that. Oh and by the way, now they are going to charge me 30 Euros for the transfer! Well, great. That's actually the reason we chose them over another hotel we were considering, because that's a good value. I know this isn't Ameria, but....false advertising much? Secondly, just as far as being inhospitable, the day we were leaving for the trip, my father passed away, and we could not go. Just a few hours after I was notified of his death, I diligently emailed Sultan's Eye to let them know we would not be at the airport for the pick-up and had to cancel our reservation. I never received even an email back from them, confirming they had received my email, much less that they appreciated that I went out of my way to prevent any undue burden for them of driving out to the airport, etc. And if I could take the time to do that courtesy for them while dealing with the death of my father, I would certainly think they could do me the courtesy of replying and confirming how they were going to handle my cancellation. By looking at my credit card activity, I see that they did charge us for what looks like one night's stay, which would seem to be consistent with their cancellation policy on their website (amazing!). I certainly won't fault them for actually being consistent in that regard (and we have travel insurance to help us with any financial losses like this), but clearly they don't provide even basic courtesies, much less going above and beyond.

This was at midnight and nothing was really happening so he obviously wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t interested in a tip! So even though I was tired from my travels I had to take my own bag up 3 flights of stairs! Suite was basically a normal room with a bigger bathroom and a Jacuzzi, which after sightseeing and walking all day was nice. Did leak though and even though I reported and they claimed to have fixed I still had the same problem! Room did have dim lighting so we had to keep the bathroom light on in the evenings, I think this was being addressed as there were 2 wires sticking out of the ceiling. Room was cleaned daily. Had to keep the bathroom closed as smelt of raw sewage at times and the heating was on full blast which I had to turn down with valves on either side of the radiator. Don't rely on the Wi-Fi as signal was very poor and kept dropping, best signal was in reception area and breakfast area downstairs. Were allowed to use the Wi-Fi of Amiral Palace opposite but that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much better. There was a laptop in the corner in the lobby but most of the time it was occupied. Even though breakfast advertised as on the roof terrace I think this is no more as looked like our room had been the terrace! Breakfast was basic but ok, bread, cheese, meats and spreads. Overall room was ok but having passed other rooms on my way up and down they looked very small indeed, so unless you are staying in the Suite I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend as over Easter the rooms were not cheap!
