The hotel was a fantastic base from which to explore Berlin. Kurfurstendamm U-Bahn station is a 1 minute walk from the hotel. The Zoolischer Garten U-Bahn and Bus station is around 5 minutes walk around the back of the Hotel - as is Berlin Zoo. At Zoolischer Garten station you can catch the 100 bus for a couple of Euro's which will get you to the Reichstag/Brandenburg Gate and other places of interest within 10-15 minutes. The hotel is also just a short walk away from Kaiser-Wilhelm Gedachtniskirche. There are a host of shops - ranging from small tourist type shops to the Tommy Hilfiger store on the Ku'Damm. Also, a mixture of small and large eateries and places to get a drink. The Ku'Damm is obviously very noisy until late at night and our hotel room looked out to the front of the hotel but the room was very quiet with the balcony door closed and the room offered excellent air con too! The breakfast is excellent and offers a wide selection of choices - fruits, yoghurts, croissants, cereals, sausage, eggs, bacon, pastries - you name it! Staff were friendly and helpful always. My only (very) small gripe was that our room was a little small - but as we were using it purely as a base to explore the city, this really wasn't much of an issue. If you have children with you - beware the rather explicit adult channels on the TV - there appears to be no parental lock on this!

We had reservations at a beautiful pension which was promised to us over the phone to be wheelchair accessible, but quickly discovered after showing up to check in that it was not. This hotel was very accessible, and probably ended up being a better place to stay for only 15 euros more a night. The staff was helpful, there was a computer with internet access to use in the lobby, and the location was fantastic- both the Zoologischer Garten station and the Ku'damm stations were very close by. There is all sorts of shopping on Ku'damm, and the sightseeing bus stops right outside the hotel. The room was quite nice with comfy beds, lots of pillows, and a nice separate seating/work area, although having a curtain instead of a bathroom door was a bit odd. There was a separate door to the toilet area which provides some privacy though. Breakfast was delicious, but not worth the 18 euro each. We splurged on it since this was the last stop on our trip, but really should have gone to the bakery across the way or the many other bakeries near the Zoo station to eat for a fraction of the cost. Also, the phone charges were really high- we had to call a toll number to speak with the airlines for the trip home (the website for each airline said 15 cents a minute) but with the hotel charges, one call came out as 15 euro and the other as 8, even though we were only on the phone for 15 minutes total between the two calls.

Scant storage space. Minibar. The amenities were adequate in all respects. Free Ethernet on a work table with plenty of plugs plus WiFi if needed at a fee. Typically sterile Euro-modern styling that's functional but without much character or charm. The lobby is small and suitable for arrivals and check-outs only. Conference space on 1st floor. The restaurant was OK, but limited. Room service offered a few items and was a little inconsistent, though food quality was always good. Their \"giant\" hamburger is huge, and very much to American taste. Breakfast (included in our package) offered a nice variety, though the space is unpleasantly cramped when the hotel is full. They need an egg timer, and sometimes produced soft boiled eggs that were rocks in the center and runny outside (microwave?). Staff was consistently pleasant and helpful.

Not only that but the other Trip Advisor reviews seemed to confirm all this. I'm not sure why everyone liked this hotel so much. For $160 a night, I don't think it's a very great deal. The Mercure hotel at Berlin airport was even nicer and larger and included a bathtub for only $60 a night. It's also a 3 star hotel, which I believe would be a more appropriate rating for the Lindner for several reasons. The rooms are small, there is no bath tub (only a shower with a clear glass door), privacy (as others have mentioned) is an issue because there is no door seperating the bathroom from the main room (they are in the same room) and you can hear everything that goes on in there. The doors to the shower and toilet are made of a frosted glass which you can see through. There are no handles, but holes cut in the glass to act as handles and so this also impeeds your privacy and in the case of the shower allows water to get through. This does not make for a very romantic setting, needless to say. On top of that, my resevation was not ready on time. I arrived at the airport a bit ahead of schedule and visited the Lindner to see if there was anyway I could get a room earlier as I was exhausted from the flight. They explained that I would have to come back at 3. So in a complete daze with no where to rest I wandered the streets of Berlin for 4 hours. I returned to the Lindner a couple minutes before 3 and was informed there was no room for me. I watched as several couples (German-speaking I should note) were lead up to their rooms without hesitation. Finally, at 4:30 I was informed that a room was available. Later a bowl of fruit and some mineral water was sent up to help smooth over my discomfort with the situation. I should note that once the fruit was finished the maids did not remove the remains (banana peels, pits, etc.) which were left to rot in the room during our entire stay. I'd like to say that at least they tried, but I don't think the Lindner tries very hard to accomodate its guests very well. I think they just want your money and that it could be better spent elsewhere (a 3 star hotel for example would be just as nice). We also had numerous problems with our key cards not working and had to exchange them at the front desk several times. I would advise people who are looking for a nice fun place to stay in Berlin to stay elsewhere- possibly pay more for a really nice place like the Swissotel or if you're a young couple stay someplace outside the shopping district of Ku Damm. I would recommend staying near Potsdammer Platz, Alexander Platz, or elsewhere in Mitte because that is where all the historic sights and clubs are.

Although we had the smallest room type, it was spotlessly clean and very comfortable, and we had a nice view of the Ku' Damm too. Reception staff were friendly and efficient. As others have mentioned, privacy may be an issue at the Lindner, with the stylish glass and full length mirrors leaving nowhere to hide when taking a shower (although presumably only children will be tempted to peek through the hole in the frosted toilet door!). For this reason, I'd recommend sharing a room only with someone you already know very well. The only other niggle was that we had to struggle a bit to get the room-width windows covered by the black-out curtain - but it is possible. We weren't disturbed by any noise. However, the quirky layout aside, the rooms are very nice and the beds large and comfy. There is a safe and minibar, and a wardrobe with hangers and an umbrella which we were very glad to borrow, and a suitcase stand - in fact everything that is needed is there. I think it lives up well to its 4 stars. Public areas are pleasant and the modern art is a nice touch. There is a slick, business-like feel to the hotel, and in fact there were quite a few business people staying there, but tourists were made to feel welcome too. There's a free internet connection just off the lobby if you need to look anything up, which is useful. We didn't eat there, so can't comment on the food. There are many choices for food nearby.

This hotel is in a great location, especially for shopping. The tour bus (that we took and got us to all of the locations that you might want to see) starts from opposite, so great starting point for sightseeing too. The room was spacious, although not what I would really call a \u201cjunior suite\u201d as they refer to it. No separate sitting area, but huge bathroom with bath and shower, and plenty of hanging space. Hey you've got Berlin outside your door, so why would you want to sit in the room anyway. Beds were on the firm side, but were lovely and comfortable, and although we had all of the neon and beautiful Christmas lights right outside the window, the black out curtains did exactly what they should. Breakfast has a great choice and was one of the best I have had for a while. Hot choices included bacon, eggs (boiled, scrambled or fried/omelette on request), sausages and the \u2018best\u2019 sausage patties. Then there are yoghurts, fruit, pastries, cereals, various breads, jams, preserves, cheeses, smoked salmon, meats (including delicious cold roast beef, not usual for me for breakfast, but why not, when in Berlin/Rome). If you cannot find a selection for yourself here for a hearty breakfast, then you must have very fussy tastes. The staff were friendly and welcoming and looked after us very well. Always a smile and a hello as we left and returned and when we asked for iron and dental kits at nearly midnight just after we checked in, they arrived within minutes. Hotel Lintner is very modern, first class, and was also great value for the deal we had. We used German Transfer to get to and from the airport. They were there waiting for us on arrival and picked us up from the hotel for our return at the exact time they said they would. Very efficient, great value at 31 euros each way, and much less expensive than a lot of other companies that quoted for the same trip. In fact nearly half the price of another that I almost booked. The driver on the way back played traditional Christmas music (not Slade/Wham etc.) and even gave our 3 year old daughter and her friend a chocolate bar when we got to the airport, which was a lovely touch. Berlin is amazing and we will definitely be going back soon, great in everyway, especially the people who were extremely friendly and welcoming. If you are considering going then do it, and I would recommend this hotel, we will likely stay here again. Only one negative, we tried to eat at the sports bar opposite the hotel, and we were more or less ignored 3 or 4 times, and when we did get a table, we eventually went and helped ourselves to the menus, and were then ignored again for 25 minutes, at which point we left, and had a wonderful great value Italian just of Ku'damm at Ristorante Avanti, Rankestr. 2.

We ate in the Hotel one night and the menu was limited but very nice. The breakfast is unbelievable, so much choice. We started with a fry up, then had the cheeses, hams, then the croissants, it's a wonder we could get up from the table. I cant say what the standard rooms were like as we stayed in a suite on the 3rd floor, which was amazing.

The location, at the Kurfurstendamm, is excellent. The hotel's public areas and rooms are well appointed and modern and trendy. But.... this seems to be typically one of those hotels that forget what a hotel is for: a good night's sleep in a comfortable room. That is exactly what this hotel doesn't offer..... We made a reservation for a two bed non smoking de luxe room. Upon arrival we were told that it would either have to be a smoking room or a one - not very big - bed room. No upgrade or other alternative were offered. As we arrived late, we did not have the energy to go out again and look for another hotel, so we took the one bed room. The room itself was rather small for a de luxe room, but I guess that is the case in almost every big city. The real problems with the room were that 1) it was located opposite a very brightly lit building and the black out curtains were too short to darken the room, 2) the toilet comes out immediately on the room, opposite the bed and it has a glass door (everything going on in there clearly visible and audible for the other person in the room), 3) the bathroom also comes out immediately on the room opposite the bed and has no door at all (everything going on there clearly visible from the whole room also). Because of the peculiar lay-out of the room, it is impossible to have any privacy at all in the bathroom or the toilet. Friends of us were staying in the same hotel and their room had the same lay-out , so it was not just a bad-luck-room that we had.
