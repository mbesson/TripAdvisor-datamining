Another key reason we love this hotel is the pool and sauna room. After a day of walking and sightseeing, this is the best place to be. There are many great restaurants around but definitely don't go to the Chinese restaurant next door.

The location was great, and my room, while small, was cozy and comfortable. A slightly larger room might have been better for my extended business trip, but for a few days or a week, this room and hotel would be great. The room had what I needed in the way of a work area and the bed was simply fantastic. Storage space was limited to one small closet and a few shelves in a built-in storage area. There was one small backed chair in the room along with a desk chair. I had a corner room on the sixth floor that had windows facing both the front of the hotel and a small side street. With the windows closed I could hardly hear a thing, although some traveling companions moved to court facing rooms after a few days, street noise and sounds from a local Irish pub given as the reason. For me the corner room was great; two windows, and a lot of light when the curtains were open and fresh air as temperature permitted. The room\u2019s thick curtains blackened the room for afternoon naps and late weekend wake-ups. My long stay was made even more enjoyable by a very pleasant staff and a very nice breakfast that was included in our room price. The concierge arranged dinner for us on Valentines day at a nearby restaurant with little notice and the front desk staff were always there to help with questions. The hotel has a small gym with just a few treadmills that were difficult to use as a result of the small space they were placed in. The hotel\u2019s indoor pool is nice, and while I didn\u2019t indulge, massages were available as well. The bathroom in my room was quite nice with one exception, the bathtub. It must be the new style, bathtubs in hotels are getting more narrow, and this bathtub is no exception. I found standing in the tub to take a shower a balancing act, and side placement of the tub\u2019s faucet didn\u2019t help any. The location of this hotel couldn\u2019t be better, I walked to just about every place to see in Paris, and when I needed to, the metro was just a short distance away. While I opted to eat outside the hotel except for breakfast, I sat with friends for a short time while they had dinner at the hotel, the food looked great, and my friends were very happy with what they got.

For shoppers I'd recommend Le Marais (3rd arrondisment) and the Ile de Cite and Ile de St Louis (04-05 arrondisment). There are no doubt better places to buy stuff, but for the average tourist hitting the highlights, plan your trip to Paris during \"Soldes\" (mid-January-February, and mid-June-July) or wait til you get home) 6) Easy walking distance to the D'Orsay museum and L'Orangerie. Reasonable walking distance to La Tour Eiffel. 7) Excellent recommendations from the Concierge for places to eat within walking distance. 8) Nice safe neighborhood 9) Super staff.

Beautiful, safe neighborhood with amazing window-shopping opportunities (as well as actual shopping, though it's a Ritzy neighborhood - literally - the Ritz and Place Vendome are two blocks away). The lobby is small but nice, with complimentary coffee in the morning and water and sweets throughout the rest of the day. We were in Paris to celebrate an anniversary, and we were upgraded to a small suite facing Rue du Mont-Thabor. We definitely heard some noise from the bar across the street on a Friday night, but it was manageable - perhaps being on a high floor made it so. We had a two-room suite - sitting room and bedroom - with a full bath with shower and another bathroom with sink and tub (but no toilet). We really appreciated having two bathrooms. Bedding and finishes were very nice but nothing spectacular. It felt rather like a nice stateroom on a cruiseship - compact. Large Bulgari toiletries in the bathrooms, which were replaced when needed. There was a funky smell in one of the bathrooms but it wasn't overly bothersome. The front desk sent up an anniversary note with a small guidebook, a bottle of wine, and a box of chocolates on our first night - a lovely touch. The front desk staff were helpful, and the concierges were able to give us directions, confirm a dinner reservation via phone, and respond to other small requests. We never went to the spa or pool.

Breads, eggs (including cooked-to-order omelette if we wanted), fruit, yogurt, cereal, sausage, juices, coffee. No complaints since it was included, but if you're buying breakfast you may be better off finding a cafe on the Rue St.-Honore'.

My wife and I stayed here on the first night of an 11-day trip to Paris, London and Munich in October 2011. We were going to London initially, but we flew from the U.S. in and out of Paris for various reasons, and decided to stay one night at a Paris hotel first, to decompress. We chose this hotel for our \"decompression: night and it was terrific. The hotel is easy to find and very well-located just south of the Place Vendome, in the 1er arrondissement. The surrounding neighborhood is nice and there are lots of attractions (like the Opera) within easy walking distance, but the property isn't noisy at all, which is terrific for Paris. Upon check-in, I was greeted very warmly and we were immediately upgraded without even asking, to a junior suite. I believe this was because I'm a Marriott Rewards member; also, we arrived just off the plane from CDG at about 11:30 AM, so they probably had a good amount of rooms available. Anyway, I wouldn't count on the upgrade happening every time, but it was certainly very welcome. We had to wait only a few minutes in the lobby for the room to be ready - - no problem. The junior suite was very spacious and comfortable. It was impeccably clean, and the staff was very friendly and responsive to our requests (extra towels and such). The employee who showed us to our room and explained all of the amenities was very friendly and helpful. We mostly slept during our time in the room, but the overall experience couldn't have been better. I was sorry to leave. Upon returning to Paris, we had a near-disaster at a highly-reviewed boutique hotel, and tried to return to this property, but it was booked. (Everything turned out fine as we stayed at another great place.) The staff was once again very friendly at checkout and helped us with our bags into the taxi they called to take us to the train station. Some room specifics: we had a nice interior courtyard view, which was very pretty. The bathroom in the junior suite is really big with a separate tub, shower, and toilet compartment, and a very good-sized counter. The suite has a small living area with a couple of comfy chairs and a TV, and the sleeping area is quite sizeable for Paris.

Prior to our stay I emailed the hotel, mentioned it was a special occasion and asked for some restaurant recommendations as the excellent restaurant, L'Ardoise down the street was closed on Mondays. I heard from Olivier, the concierge, right away with several excellent choices. He made us dinner reservations prior to our arrival.

We were on the 5th floor (502) facing rue du Mont Thabor and were not bothered by any street noise.

Carr's also seemed to be very popular for happy hour and their posted drink prices were very reasonable. I also like the bar at the hotel.

The hotel provided Bulgari toiletries which have a light unisex fragrance and a luxurious feel. There were plenty of hangers in the small closet and just enough space for us to hang the clothes that needed to be hung up. The rest of our clothes went on shelves in another small closet. The service we received was perfect. The concierge not only provided us with Museum Passes at cost, he helped us plan our days. Any request or question we asked was responded to pleasantly and effortlessly, as though the staff lives to serve guests. The location was excellent, and I think it was actually better to be one block away from the Tuileries rather than be directly on the Rue de Rivoli as that is a very busy road with noise and exhaust fumes. The only negative thing we can think of is that the bathroom has a split door of frosted glass for space-saving purposes. Unfortunately this split door provides very little privacy and even when travelling with someone you love, there are times you want privacy.

We own several Marriott timeshares and thru that program we have always been able to stay in Paris using points and have stayed at the Marriott on the Champs \u00c3\u2030lys\u00c3\u00a9es and at the Renaissance Trocadero near Victor Hugo in the 16th Arr. Because of the mostly great reviews of the Vendome Renaissance, I was excited to stay here and see how we liked this location, so we stayed 3 nights at this hotel last week. First I'll mention the positive things. Several months ago I emailed the hotel and asked if they could get us a dinner reservation at Frenchie, which they did and it was a great restaurant. Our room cost us many points but we also upgraded to a larger King bed room for 90E per night more. And the room was a nice size- bigger than many Paris hotel rooms and the bed was great- very comfy with nice linens- the bed may have had a featherbed topper on it as it was soft, which we like because we have a featherbed at home. As mentioned in most other reviews, the location is very good if you want to be near the Louvre and the Tuileries. For those who mentioned it being close to the Arc de Triomphe.....well, let's put it thie way, the Louvre is at one end of the Champs and the Arc is at the other end and it's not a short street. Now for the negatives from our recent experience. When we arrived a bellman helped us right away and the doormen were always nice, but at the desk the reception was cool at best. I asked for a room on a high floor and the 3rd floor was the best they could do. I asked if we could have a room with a balcony- they said no rooms with balconies were available. I asked if there were corner rooms available and the woman then turned to a man who was also working at the desk and he said, in a very aloof manner, that those rooms are suites and thus would cost much more money. So, when reading past reviews that say they were upgraded for free, etc, this sure didn't happen with us. And we have an upgraded Marriott Visa card and have spent enough on Marriott time shares to have probably bought a 2nd home ! So, we go to our room and it is facing the street, which I thought was ok- but read on a bit later about that. The bathroom is large but there is no place to put toiletries except at the back of the tub where they get all wet from the shower. Right across from the bathroom there is a small (really small) closet and it had a couple shelves, so I used those for some hair products, etc. Before arriving in Paris we had been in Provence for a week at a couple great places- they had free wi-fi- did this hotel ? No- it cost 7E per hour or 15E per day. And I think there was even a charge for using the TV, which we didn't care to use anyway. As far as being on the 3rd floor facing the street- there is an Irish Pub across the street that seems to be a popular place- especially the later it gets at night. So every night we had quite a bit of noise from the Pub, but thhe worst night was last Saturday night- we had an early flight from Paris Sunday am so we had to get up at 5 am. Went to bed about 10:30pm, while at the Pub they had a group that.played horns- very loud horns- til at least midnight. That and the very cool front desk reception we got were the worst things about this hotel. Not sure I'd ever stay there again, but if we did, I would want a room in the back/inside of the hotel- course if I asked for that, they probably wouldn't give it to me ! As far as the Marriott on the Champs- it is a very nice hotel and we were always treated well there, altho it is a very busy area to stay in considering the location. The Renaissance Trocadero is in a quiet residential area but it's near Place Victor Hugo and about a 15-20 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower or the Arc de Triomphe. It is an older property and the smallest rooms are small, but they have a variety of room sizes.

I could not have been more lucky! The staff at this hotel went out of their way to smile, be friendly, and make sure all of my needs were met all of the time. I was in room 501, which was on the 5th floor and had it's own little balcony. The room was larger than what I expected, as I had been warned that hotel rooms in Paris are notoriously tiny. The bed was very comfortable, and the air conditioning pumped out cold air all of the time. In fact, I think my room was the only place in Paris that had \"real\" air conditioning. When I arrived, there was a box of chocolates and a bottle of wine waiting for me. Also, the toiletries in the bathroom were all Bulgari: all of the soaps, shampoos, lotions, shower gel...wow! But, the very best part of the hotel was the excellent location. You are one block from Rue di Rivoli, which is perfect because you do not want to be \"on\" Rue di Rivoli because of the noise. The Renaissance is tucked on a little street just behind Rivoli, so you are near the main drag without having the nuisance (noise) of being on the main drag. You are close to a ton of great restaurants and cafes. There is a small spa in the lowest level of the hotel. There is a steam room and a sauna. The steam room had an unusual ceiling, which gave the effect of tiny little stars. Sitting in the steam room after a long day of walking around Paris was heaven! There is also one \"body shower\" in the spa, which I took advantage of after each steaming. I was pretty surprised to find that there was a pool in the lower level, too. The spa is not large and is for hotel guests. The reason why I point this out is because sometimes a hotel will advertise to come to their hotel for the spa (ie, the spa is the destination) and then you find that the spa is the size of a closet. The spa at the Renaissance is definitely not large, but also is not the size of a closet.

I even moved the chair to the entryway of my room to try and get more space within the room, but then I had to jump over the chair to enter and leave! It was annoying. I was so glad that I'd only brought a carry on bag, as I'm not sure what you would even do with a full-size suitcase. There's no place to put it in the room! The service of the hotel was mediocre. The front desk staff I found to be somewhat intrusive, the bar staff was distracted, the restaurant food was just o.k., the room service was decent and they at least seemed to try fairly hard. I just wasn't impressed with the place - as perhaps I had higher expectations for a Renaissance hotel. It was not dramatically superior to a good Marriott, and as Marriott Rewards Gold member I didn't feel that I got any special treatment during my stay. This hotel has one important thing going for it - an excellent location. It is very centrally-located, which is why I chose to stay there. Very convenient place, which makes walking easy. The location also is important because it is on a side street - thus, it is a quiet place to stay. No complaints about getting sleep (e.g., no traffic noise, no subway noises, etc. - which I've read is problematic about other luxury hotels in Paris). For that reason alone, I might stay there again. That's what I'd say to anyone considering the hotel - it's a quite place to stay, close to many sites, but don't have high expectations. The \"view\" out the windows is somewhat dreary - overlooks apartments on one side and a small street on the other.

It ended up being too chilly to use during this stay, but in our previous stay we had really enjoyed sitting out there in the evening after a day of walking and having a glass of wine. The room itself is very cosy and comfortable and although small is perfect for a short city break when you're likely to be out for most of the day.

It was an excellent choice, and for a Marriott, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel, it lived up to its marketing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like a large \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hotel, but like a Boutique hotel. We stayed on Marriott points, with an upgraded (50 Euro/night) to get a larger room - so I can't speak to value if I was paying full price. The points upgrade was worth it, but probably not necessary. No hotel is cheap in Paris, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very difficult to find anything that is well done (upgraded), that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dated or shabby, or feels like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchopped up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, without spending a very large amount of money. This is a Marriott, not the Ritz (around the corner), but the service was top-notch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very helpful. Best quality: location. Incredibly central \u00e2\u20ac\u201c close walking to Vendome, Rue Saint-Honore, Gallery-Lafayette \u00e2\u20ac\u201c lots of great upscale shopping and choice of restaurants nearby, but on a quiet street.

The hotel was remodeled in the last three years, but looks like in the last six month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both rooms and lobby. The main lobby was at one time a small inner (outdoor) courtyard for the building surrounding it. A vaulted glass roof at the 1st floor level closes in the court-yard to create the hotel lobby. Some of the interior hotel rooms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 windows look down on the roof, and into the lobby. There is plenty of comfortable seating, and a side sitting room with a REAL, wood burning fire-place (and they use it). D\u00c3\u00a9cor is chic is and contemporary/modern, but not stark. There is a self-serve coffee/espresso maker to make coffee at any time. Our room was excellent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c facing the street, with little street noise (on a Friday/Saturday night). The room was one \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclass\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 up from the standard room (not a suite), with plenty of room to get around, and lots of clothing storage (hanging space and shelves), and an excellent sized bathroom, especially by European standards.

We chose the hotel for its location and the pool, a combination not easy to find in Paris. Check-in was easy and welcoming. The hotel is not large, but it is well appointed and attractive, in my view. The lobby looks like it was recently renovated and is comfortable. There's a lounge / pseudo business area off to the side of the lobby with reading material and a fireplace. Thumbs up on the lobby / lounge. The elevators are very much \"old Paris\". They're cozy, but reasonably fast. On the other hand, hallways on each floor are reasonably sized and reasonably well done. In contrast to other reviews I've seen, we were pretty happy with the size of our room. However, we stayed in a junior suite, where there is a separate room with a couch that folds out to a bed for a third person, which we needed. TVs, beds, desk, etc. were all tasteful and functional. Drawer space was lacking, though the shelves in the closets do allow for sufficient space to put clothes, etc. Bed was comfortable, however, was not a true king size bed. They pushed together two twin beds and then put a pad over that. Not a big deal, but not as comfortable as a real king. One quibble with the maid service was that they did not clean obviously used glassware until we asked. They also left insufficient towels twice, despite the room being set up for three people. No big deal, the desk had towels brought up both times. We slept extremely well. The curtains when drawn let in absolutely no light ... which makes it easy to sleep away half the day if you're not careful. It was also extremely quiet despite being in the middle of the city. The bathroom was large with a very nice bathtub, separate shower, and a toilet in its own alcove with a door for privacy. The bathroom lacked sufficient bars to hang wet towels, so essentially, you either refold your wet towels and put them on the shelf where they do not dry or leave them on the floor for the maid service to pick up. Not very environmentally friendly -- and brings down room quality a notch, in my view. We didn't try out the room service as we kept the couch pulled out to be a bed the whole time, thus not too much room for a proper meal. Maybe next time. We did try out the Asian-themed bar in the lobby. The drinks were good, but the food was so-so. Service was ok. The pool is indoors, small, but very nice. There are also a fitness area and spa, which are nicely sized considering the size of the hotel (not large). Location is outstanding. You're near the center of the city, Les Tuilleries, Louvre, Vendome, the river, etc. etc. In fact, it's almost too good, because the neighborhood is all about expensive boutiques and tourist-focused high-end restaurants.

A complementary bottle of champagne awaited us upon arrival in our room. We had a view down on Rue du Mont Thabor. It was quiet. The air conditioning in the room was effective.

The thick white towels are fluffy and warm. We never shared the sauna or hammam with any other guests. There are some good quality aerobic exercise machines as well as a resistance multi-gym. You have to try the complementary nougat in the bowl at reception - it's excellent. In the mornings there is a free tea and coffee station in reception for guests, and later in the day this is replaced by jugs of water flavoured either with a choice of lemon/lime segments or orange segments. You can ask reception staff for complementary chilled bottles of Evian water at any time of the day or night - especially useful to take to bed, or out with you when you go sight-seeing. It's small touches like this that set this hotel apart from its larger more impersonal competitors. I was able to use the PC in the small business centre area adjoining the reception to complete our online check-in and print our boarding cards. We also used the in-room broadband internet connection for a couple of days - at a small extra charge. The Renaissance beds and pillows were really comfortable and the Bulgari toiletries another very nice touch. Our room was equipped with a bedside clock-radio-alarm-iPod dock as well as a good flat- screen TV and discreet CD/DVD player. DVDs are available to rent from reception, but we had brought our own films and music. Across the road, immediately opposite the hotel is Carr's Irish \"pub\". We could occasionally hear the live piano in the evenings but were never disturbed by it. It too has a friendly atmosphere and welcoming staff and we had one very late evening there meeting and chatting to locals, as well as other visitors. There are so many good restaurants within walking distance, and I would strongly advise any prospective guests to talk to the excellent concierge team at the Renaissance Paris Vendome to get recommendations and make bookings. The most popular restaurants are difficult to book, but don't forget that some of them open for lunch as well and can offer devastatingly good value prix fixe lunch menus!! If you dislike crowds and noisy fellow guests, if you hate queuing to talk to reception and concierge staff, and if you prefer personal service, then stay here; you will find an oasis of calm and quality awaiting you - it really is a hidden gem, and the swimming pool is a real bonus after a day of shopping and sight-seeing, or as a lovely way to start your day.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel but it's a 4-star if you've stayed at 5-star hotels in the past\u201d", "Author": "TravelgalCathy", "ReviewID": "UR70614075", "Content": "Let me begin by prefacing this with the fact that I have been to Paris several times and have stayed in St. Germain, Montparnasse, and the Marais in the past. I stayed at this hotel for one night only, after a lengthy journey to Paris and I wanted a luxurious, convenient hotel for our first night. (We rented an apartment for the rest of our stay by Rue Montorguiel and loved it!) I used Marriott points for the room and was able to upgrade to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153larger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room for a reasonable amount of money. While they tout themselves as having a \u00e2\u20ac\u01535-star\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rating, I felt this hotel fell short to be deserving of this rating after experiencing 5-star hotels in various countries. Pros: this hotel is conveniently located right by the Tuileries metro stop and close to many of the tourist sites. The room was well-appointed, nice amenities as listed on their website, but it was not as spacious as I expected for having paid an additional 70 euros to upgrade to a larger room. I realize Paris hotels are small, but this was not worth the upgrade. Cons: this hotel is located in a very touristy area, on the higher end of the price tag. For me this is a con because I enjoy soaking up the Parisian culture, and there were not a lot of Parisians dining in the restaurants close to the hotel. In addition, the restaurants close to the hotel were over-priced and we did not find the food or wine particularly good which is typical in very touristy areas. The hotel breakfast was 30E per person and was not as robust as other buffet breakfasts I have had at other hotels in Europe. For 30E, I felt they should have had more offerings. They charged for wifi in the room and the gym was extremely humid since it is right next to the pool, so much that we didn't want to use it. The service at this hotel was good, but not great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was definitely not the 5-star level of service that I have experienced at hotels with this same rating in Asia, Latin America or the US. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to have the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re here to serve you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd attitude that I have experienced at many hotels, regardless of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153star\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rating. When we checked into the hotel, we were told that breakfast was included in our room rate. When we checked out they had charged us for breakfast and we contested it. They took it off the bill, but I had to be insistent. At the end of our stay and departure from the hotel, we were in a hurry to get to our bags out of storage. The bellman was on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153break\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so we were asked to sit down and wait for him as they tried to contact him. We had also asked for a taxi, and while we were waiting for the bellman to show up, they gave 2 cabs away to people who came up after us. It all turned out fine, but I had to be a little more assertive than usual in order to get them to move at a faster pace. If you have never stayed in a 5-star hotel before, this would be fine. However, if I was going to spend money for a 5-star hotel experience in Paris, I would choose another hotel as there are plenty of others to choose from.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bournemouth", "Title": "\u201cA perfect start to our honeymoon!\u201d", "Author": "MrsKeward", "ReviewID": "UR70500988", "Content": "We stayed here for the first 3 nights of our honeymoon.

We used points to cover part of our stay, but paid for an upgrade to a larger room/breakfast/internet connection. We felt it was worth it since we used the internet connection to call home (though Paris touts lots of Wi-fi connections, we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find a hot spot), were happy for the few extra square meters of space, and enjoyed the breakfast buffet on the mornings it was included. Our room was on the first floor, facing an outside courtyard, and was generally very quiet. (The view out the window looked like there was a clothing business/alteration shop facing us.) Since this room was fine, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask for anything higher up (and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to end up facing the noisier street side). The bathroom had a frosted glass pocket door and glass doors for the WC and separate shower (which had only an 18\" opening to squeeze through due to the vanity counter), but it was private enough. However, when the bathroom light is on, it also illuminates the bedroom area due to that glass door. Overall this is the cleanest Marriott hotel we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever visited, and the location on a tiny side street (but quite close to main areas for shopping, cafes, and museums) was ideal for this visit. The room and bed were comfortable, and everything--lobby, restaurant, pool/spa area, and our room--was well-maintained by the staff. Turn-down service each evening included a single, large chocolate lollipop for us to fight over (it was extremely hard to eat, but the rest traveled home well for souvenirs). One small, complimentary water bottle was included with the room, but not replenished after the first day despite our inquiries; not sure why this is a touted amenity on their website. The breakfast buffet had a nice choice of fresh fruit, assorted cheeses, fresh boulangerie items, sausage/bacon, cold cereal, yogurt, and eggs (made to order); it is more European in style and so it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer exactly the same selections as an American hotel. If you enjoy reading the paper over breakfast or want to brush up on your foreign language skills, there are daily editions of French, German, and Italian newspapers to pick up at the restaurant entrance (and a printed news summary in English was also delivered to our door each day). The breakfast meal carried us through the day, usually supplemented only with something wonderful from a Parisian patisserie, until a late dinner. If it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t included as part of a package, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth the 29 euros/person unless convenience is more important. Angelina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (on Rue de Rivoli) was a nice alternative, not busy for breakfast (only heard a few Parisians there), and the price for two in their beautiful dining room was about 30 euros total (depending on what you order). There are also numerous other dining alternatives easily within walking distance of the hotel. When we arrived everything was as specified in our online reservation, but be sure to take a printout of your reservation with you. Even though all of the details were confirmed at check-in, they still cited an internet charge on the final bill, and so the paper copy was helpful to prove otherwise. We had also requested an early check-in and late check-out. Ended up not needing the early check-in due to volcano delays on our arrival day, but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a later checkout of even one hour as they said they were expecting another guest. They did stow the luggage for us on that last day. We ventured everywhere in the area on foot, and via nearby bus, metro, and RER, saving taxis only for nights we were dining someplace farther out. While the doormen are quite happy to call a cab, you may want to consider walking up Rue d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Alger to Rue de Rivoli (just one block) as taxis are numerous and easy to flag there; it will save you several euros since the meter starts from wherever they get the call, not from the pickup point. Overall, it was a lovely stay. We enjoyed the fact that this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a large hotel, and really was more boutique-like in style, even if part of a corp. chain. The staff were friendly and gracious, the concierge helpful; everyone we spoke with at the hotel was bi-lingual, so we had no problems whether communicating in French or English.

In the Junior Suite 217, the bathroom was much larger with a large sink, a tub, a separate, great, shower and a separate WC. Large containers of Bulgari toiletries were provided in both bathrooms.

I travel on my own jet, and have high expectations, and this hotel stacks up very favorably against the best on every continent. We stayed there for two weeks at the end of October, 2009. The location is absolutely perfect -- it's an easy walk to the Garnier for the ballet (don't miss it), the high end shopping on every surrounding street, and the Louvre and Notre Dame and just about everything else. Other districts are a short cab ride away. The rooms are very well appointed and stylishly modern (not that junk that looks like everything is upholstered with a 200 year old curtain). The restaurant is awesome on its own. And the staff is top notch, from bellmen to concierges to waiters and waitresses, and exceptionally friendly. My fiance and I speak very little French but the staff never missed a beat. One service example: We arrived at 6 am on an overnight flight and yet they checked us in immediately, which we did not expect. That nap made all the difference. Speaking of which, the beds and bedding are phenomenal. Enjoy the restaurant (it's excellent -- ask to sit at the bar and watch the chefs at work), but also get out and walk the area and just dive in anywhere on a whim.

But if you've never been, my point is to not over-plan. Go with the flow. At this hotel, everything is within walking distance so it's easy to do so. Avoid the areas south of the hotel (stay north of the main drag) and you get better, less touristy fare. Someone commented that the staff seems indifferent because they think you're using points. I never saw that one time. I did see them have to deal with some idiots, and they handled it perfectly. BTW, enjoy a beer or two at the Irish/English pub across the street as you walk back home at night. Great crowd, friendly young owners, fun nightcap. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't demand a bland \"chain hotel\" experience. It's more like an Ian Schrager type small boutique than a Hyatt or Ritz Carlton. Yes, it's small, but that's also itys charm. Next time I'm in Paris, I'll stay here. I won't stay at the Four Seasons George V, even though I have before, and money isn't the issue.

We walked everywhere: it is close to Notre-Dame, Musee D'Orsay, and the Louvre, in particular, but one evening we even walked from L'Arc de Triomphe back to our hotel along the Champs-Elysees. As others have noted, the rooms are very small, with just room enough to get around the bed, and very little room for toiletries in the bathroom. We were offered a 5th floor room with a balcony or a larger 2nd floor room without. We chose the latter, though I can't imaging how the 5th floor room could have been any smaller! The room was very clean and the bed comfortable. The staff at the front desk was very helpful and pleasant, and spoke English well. Internet use costs 7 euros/hr or 15/day and there is an ipod dock in the room. We did not eat there, opting to go out as others have recommended to the many nearby cafes and restaurants. The food, coffee, and wine were excellent, with L'Ardoise restaurant my favorite. Be aware that everything in Paris is expensive, about 50% more once converted to dollars. We flew into Charles DeGaulle Airport and took public transportation, which is much cheaper than a taxi, but was very awkward with a suitcase and bag each. On the way back, we splurged on the taxi and it was worth it. By the way, we were very happy with Air France. We had Rick Steves' book on Paris which was invaluable. The first day we took his walking tour of historic Paris which was a great way to see many sites and much better than if we had tried to navigate ourselves. Another day we managed to cover most of the paintings in the Louvre in 7 hours of walking with no breaks. The Musee D'Orsay was also wonderful and as an artist, I was in heaven. Both museums allow photography without flashes. Sacre Coeurs and Montmartre were breathtaking and took most of a day as we again followed a walking tour of Rick Steves'. Rick Steves recommends buying a SIM card in the country you're visiting which I did. I already had a tri-band international phone. It is cheaper this way but the instructions and voice prompts are in French.

The lobby/dining areas and guest rooms are very nice, clean and comfortable. (One suggestion about room selection - I wouldn't recommend an interior room with a courtyard balcony. It looked nice but was so loud from the AC unit that we couldn't keep the windows open. A street view would have been better, even though I believe they consider the interior rooms to be superior.) The hotel is also in a great, convienient location. Why only three stars if it was so nice? There are a few reasons... Our problems started at check-in. We were told that it would be an additional 70 euros/ night for the king bed/prestige room we requested. We had not requested this upgrade (I had the paperwork to proove it). The woman at the desk, although she didn't seem to actually believe us that we hadn't requested this, told us she would get us a standard room, but that it wasn't ready yet. This was not a problem, as they held our luggage for us while we went to lunch. When we returned, just after check-in time, our room was still not ready. The same woman at the desk offered us complimentary drinks in the bar to compensate for the delay. This was a nice gesture and kept us satsfied for a little while... but once it was 90 minutes past the hotel check-in time we were becoming impatient. We got our room key just under two hours after check-in time. Our biggest complaint with the hotel was that it is out-of-this-world expensive! Luckily we had Marriott points to book our stay. If we had to pay the regular room rates to stay at this hotel (which we never would) we would be broke. Although it's a nice hotel with lovely rooms, in my opinion it is extremely over-priced, even for Paris... Be prepared to pay a fortune in the lobby bar for a beer/wine/soda/coffee, you name it. The hotel bar was more expensive than any other cafe we came across in the enitre city. Also, the American-Style buffet breakfast was 29 euros/person for bread, fruit, yogurt, cereal, coffee, juice, and cold eggs. We found this to be typical in most hotels in the city (20+ euros/person for a substandard breakfast buffet), but was not worth the money. This hotel is geared 100% towards Americans, or at least it felt like it. Although eveyone spoke English, which was great, it almost didn't even feel like we were in Paris! We went to breakfast one morning and were greeted, \"Good morning! Two for breakfast?\" Since we were on vacation in Paris this was a bit of a disappointment for us, as we didn't want to feel like we were home in the U.S.! Lastly, upon check-out the 70 euro/night charge for our prestige room appeared on our bill. I can't say that I was surprised, but as you can imagine, was not pleased. We told the woman at the desk that we did not request an upgrade when booking, declined the upgrade/charges at check-in, and would not pay for the charges on the bill. She was annoyed, threw her hands in the air and told us, with an attitude, that she guessed we didn't have any charges. We left on that note. I will say that most of the front desk staff, including the concierge and doormen, were very nice and accomodating. As for the actual hotel - quality of rooms and good location - it really is very nice.

The wardrobe only had about a dozen hangers, not enough for two people for a week, but more wouldn't have fit anyway. Everything in the room was in good shape. Housekeeping was good, although they only left us one chocolate some nights at turn down service, and the replenishment of toiletries was a little uneven. Our room was extremely quiet, and overlooked a small courtyard. I'm a gold member so breakfast was included. It was fine, but the service was uneven. They never brought us coffee at all one morning, and didn't bring it until we were almost through on another.

I have previously stayed at Marriott Hotels on business and always enjoyed great service and facilities. We flew in to Charles De Gaulle airport (terminal 2), and bought a one day tourist ticket for 8 euros. There are frequent trains from terminal 2 into the centre of Paris, and from there we used the RER to get to the Tuileries underground station. The hotel is right in the centre of Paris - it is literally 5 minutes walk from the RER underground station at Tuileries. This was the primary reason we chose the hotel, as we wanted to do a lot of sight seeing ;) Walking to the hotel from the RER station allows you to see just how close you are to the fabulous gardens at Tuileries, and to take in the incredible architecture of Paris. There are also several good quality restaurants and cafes in the immediate area, including the ever present MacDonalds if you really must have fast food! The hotel itself is a fairly anonymous looking building, just down the road from an Irish theme bar. Appearances can be deceiving though... once inside, the hotel has a well present, luxurious interior, with a bar off to one side, and a dining area off to the other. Check-in was fast with no problems - staff were friendly, efficient, and they all spoke EXCELLENT English. The quality of staff throughout the stay was OUTSTANDING! We had two rooms next to each other - one standard, one deluxe. The rooms were of a decent size - certainly not as big as American Marriot rooms - but were well presented, clean, and with large comfortable beds. All bathroom fittings worked - plenty of towels and toiletries! The TVs were excellent, and offered a wide selection of channels, plus the option to purchase movies and/or access the internet. In addition, the rooms had integrated DVD players and docks for i-pods! However - no tea or coffee making facilities - points would have been deducted, but apparently this is the norm for Paris hotels. The deluxe room also offered complimentary toweling dressing gowns and slippers! On a downside, the view isn't great - basically, you look out onto more buildings. You need to go out of the hotel and along the Seine to get the view. The hotel has a fitness centre and indoor pool in the basement. The fitness centre has a small range of machines and weights, but also has a sauna and steam room, which were excellent.. The pool is a good size - suitable for adults to relax, and for kids to play in. It is open until 11pm at night! Superb! We got complimentary breakfasts for our stay, and whilst the choice of food wasn't great - cereals, various breads, cold meats, a limited cooked range - service was friendly and helpful. As it was complimentary, no points deducted - however, I certainly would NOT have paid the ridiculous prices Marriot charge. 18 euros for a basic breakfast? No way! My advice would be to take a 2 minute walk from the hotel towards the Tuilieries gardens, and have coffee and breakfast at the excellent cafe on the corner for approx.6 euros per person. Much better value, and you get to sit at the pavement cafes and see Paris! There are plenty of restaurants and cafes in the immediate area - nearly all of the staff in them speak English, but they appreciate it if you at least make an effort to speak French. Food in the area is good, but watch out for the prices of drinks - the standard price for a coffee is 4 euros. As for things to do - wow! Where to start! The hotel is SUPERBLY placed to visit Paris. The Tuillerie Gardens are a lovely park walk, and are approx.5 mins walk. The Louvre is approx.7 minutes walk away. The Seine is approx.5 mins walk away. The nearest bridge (approx 7 mins walk away) allows you to get a view of the Eiffel Tower. The nearest river boat station (which is the best way to visit Paris) is approx 10 mins walk away. Taxis from the hotel to the Eiffel Tower are plentiful and cost approx.10 euros. In short this hotel is EXCELLENT for service, quality of rooms, facilities, and for its location.

The ambiance is serenely upscale, the employees are extremely helpful and polite, and the location cannot be beat. It is pricey, but luckily, we used Marriott points for \"free\" nights and spent less than $300 to upgrade to a king-size room which included breakfast. There were a couple, minor negatives. The bed was a little large for the width of the room, so we had to be careful not to stub our toes going into the bathroom. Also, we had to learn to shut the shower door without pinching our fingers. Saying that, the huge vases of orchids, the bowls of candy and fruit, and the pitchers of citrus-infused water in the lobby were welcoming sights. Our room was very comfortable and stylish with luxury fabrics, a flat screen TV, and a back-friendly mattress. A box of luscious chocolate-covered nuts, a free bottle of \"good\" water, and a vase with real flowers greeted us when we checked into the room; chocolate lollipops nestled on our pillows at night. The bathroom was large with a warming rack, a shower, and a tub, plus there was ample closet and storage space. The view was of a small, interior courtyard, which was just fine, because the room was very quiet. We did not have to contend with traffic noise. The restaurant was very good; in fact, Frommer recommends La Pinxo in his guidebook. It is the moderate-priced restaurant of a two-star Michlelin-rated chef. We celebrated our birthdays there one night, enjoying a bottle of champagne and entrees of tuna and lamb, both excellent. Breakfast was a buffet with a hot dish station, a cereal station, a cheese, salmon, and meats station, and a bread and pastry station. We did order poached eggs one day and surprisingly found them to be tough, but we didn't mind because we had so many other good choices to eat instead. The next day, we noticed another couple commenting on the \"tough\" poached eggs! The scrambled eggs, part of the hot dish station, were excellent in comparison. The wait staff, the front desk help, and the concierges were all top rate, so friendly and helpful. At the hotel, we were able to buy museum passes and our tickets for a night time Seine tour--both time savers. The hotel also recommended Au Pied De Cochan, which filled my desire to eat at an old, traditional French restaurant. It has been around since 1946 and touts that it is the creator of the original recipe for French onion soup. The soup was yummy--the best French onion soup we ever ate! As I stated above, the location is convenient to most of Paris's major attractions. We walked almost everywhere we went, so we could soak up the city's ambience. We saved a lot of money by not having to take taxis and trains in most cases. Even though there were a couple things that were not \"perfect,\" I am still giving the hotel a perfect rating.

I realize the chocolate thing is not that big of a deal, but it was a disappointment. Also, one reviewer had raved about the shower, which I thought was awful. It was a small square stall that smelled of mold/mildew, and the water pressure & temperature both varied throughout a shower. The worst thing, though, was when we were packing to leave, my daughter realized her stuffed dog was missing! She is 18 now, but has had that dog since she was about 3 & has taken him on every trip we have ever taken. The front desk assured us that it must have been taken with the sheets, they would contact the laundry service, and we would \"of course\" get the dog back.

Go to Rue Rivoli where there are loads of cafes (out of the hotel, turn left then first right and its the first street you come to, with the Jardin des Tuileries opposite). We liked The Carrousel which is on Rue Rivoli almost opposite Les Arts Decoratif. We didnt eat dinner in the hotel so cant comment on that. We went to the restaurant Les Flottes the first night (the concierges are really helpful re restaurants) and had a great steak. Not cheap but then this is Paris! In fact our only real gripe about the whole holiday would be the price of food and drink - I didnt think it could be that bad compared to Edinburgh or London, but I was wrong! Although we speak some french, all the staff we met spoke excellent english and were really helpful. All in all we had a fantastic time in this hotel and will definitely be going back.

The turn down service was perfect, the room had a great bath with lots of HOT water, plenty of towels, a robe and slippers. The best of all worlds was that this property actually takes care of anything you might leave in the room at checkout. I happened to leave my drivers license in the safe when I left. When I arrived in Brussels I realised this and had my hotel call for me. The hotel had the item and forwarded it to me at my next stop in Amsterdam, it was there when I arrived. WHAT A RELIEF!!!!!!!!

After reading all of the negative comments, I switched to this hotel and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made! About a week prior to arrival, we received an email from the concierge letting us know about current events in Paris. This ranged from art exhibits to concerts to shows. There was information on all of the transportation options from both airports as well as travel time, expense, detailed directions. As we were travelling from the west coast on an overnite flight, we opted to get the private driver from the airport. As soon as we cleared customs, there was an english speaking driver with a sign waiting for us. He had a S500 mercedes parked directly outside and we were on our way. We arrived at 11am and a room was ready for us! The location is absolutely perfect. You are right down the street from the Tuillerie Gardens, Louvre and Tuillerie metro station which is a very convenient line. I highly recommend learning how to use the metro - it saved us with rainly windy days. The concierge desk has museum passes, l'open tour passes, and can arrange tours for you as well as the usual dinner reservations, suggestions, etc. I am very serious in saying that these are some of the best hotel people that I have ever confronted. I actually ran into the general manager one afternoon and told her that whatever she is doing, it is working! The room was a little small but we had a very good rate so expected... very tastefully done, bed was comfortable, lots of shelf space in the closet, a large safe, flat screen tv, high-speed internet (expensive at 15 euros/day), well appointed bathroom with shower and separate tub. The double pain windows and a room not facing the street, very nice light blocking curtains made for a quick recovery from jetlag and great sleep. Only complaint that I can think of is that even with all of the lights on, it is still a little dark - especially on a rainy day. Breakfast was a little bit high-priced - 23 euro for cold buffet and 29 for hot. There were all kinds of breads, croissants, cheeses, fruit juices, cereals, yogurts, cut up fruits and tea or coffee so very convenient and filling. There were eggs dishes and bacon if you chose the hot menu. We ate there most days for the convenience and tried a few other places that were not any better with slower service. There is a pool in the basement of the hotel - the water is a little cool but I agree with others that it was a nice break after a day of walking! I am a little bit of a hotel snob and I can say nothing negative about this hotel. The people who work there were some of the nicest staff that I have ever dealt with anywhere - I will certainly stay there again when I go to Paris.

We were given an upgrade on arrival, but I'll be honest, unless the upgrade meant we got a mini bar... I really can't believe it was a proper upgrade. The room was very small and compact, and if we were rightly upgraded to a suite then I'd hate to have spent even more money (which I nearly did prebooking) on such a small suite. I have been to Paris before and I am aware that rooms are small most places, but fo rthe money I spent I'd have expected better. We were unfortunately right across a small street from an Irish bar.... which at the weekend allows it patrons to drink outside while smoking.... EXTREMELY LOUD... to the point you can't possibly ignore it. Adults with suits acting like kids... both fri and sat nights. We also ordered room service. My partner tried to order just a plain baguette with cheese, which they said they couldn't do as it's not on the menu!!! The food was very poor too for the money. A club sandwhich, drenched in dressing that it turned to mush. Chips were cold and merely batter. We just popped it back outside hardly touched... but were still charged full price obviously. I'm really sorry I can't give it a better review. The location was excellent, but to be honest you could stay anywhere in Paris cos the metro is that good. I feel bad as the staff were lovely.

We would like to thank the manager, Mr. Perrin, and his fine staff for a memorable stay. The concierges, Olivier, David and Xavier, made our stay even better. Size and quality of the rooms Many reviews have mentioned the size of the rooms; we found them to be typical of other large city hotels. Our first three nights were spent in Room 504 with a small balcony facing Rue Mont Thabor, a quiet street one short block from the Rue di Rivoli and the Tuillierres Gardens. The queen bed was luxurious, and the speedy Internet service was worth 15 E a day to stay in touch with the office. It is a good idea to upgrade to a large room if you can not handle small spaces or if you are accustomed to large spaces and spend a lot of time in the room. Our last four nights were in a larger Room 508, which had a king bed and two double balcony doors facing Rue Alger. My husband had a cold, and it was a great place to spend a good part of the day resting. The selection of TV channels was superb; we enjoyed listening to shows from Dubai and in so many languages. We slipped our iPod into the radio and listened to music each day and read the Wall Street Journal, Herald Tribune and USA Today provided free in the lobby. Many guests have mentioned the fine Bulgari toiletries; we also liked the large, comfortable bath towels and friendly housekeepers who did not knock when we chose to sleep during the day. The room fridges were great for storing jars of yogurt and drinks we purchased at a convenience store about two blocks away on Rue Honore, which was a great place to stroll. Our laptop just fit in the closet safe, where we stored our other valuables when we were out of the room. Hotel facilities The health club/spa downstairs looked wonderful, but we were too tired to use it after so much walking. The After the Rain spa services were inviting but too expensive for our budget at 120E for a one-hour massage. There were free beverages in the lobby and a nice living and reading room for lounging on sofas. The lobby bar was inviting and a good source of glasses of ice for our room. Hotel restaurant Each morning we had breakfast in Pinxo off the lobby; the omelets were tasty, and the selection was wonderful. The fresh sliced kiwi and French yogurt in glass jars were first class. We were spoiled by the fine breakfasts, which were included in our room package. We did not have other meals at the hotel because there are so many highly rated restaurants in the neighborhood. Where to eat nearby We relied on the paperback \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Great Eats in Paris,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and found superb food and service for about 30E per person or less without wine, which usually ran about 15E for a half bottle. Two of our favorites were a block from the hotel, L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Ardoise and Le Souffle. With a large, late breakfast, we found that one other meal a day was more than enough. It was a pleasant way to celebrate our tenth anniversary and my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first trip to Paris. Museums, museums and more museums This location was perfect for walking to museums each day. We did not bother with the Metro or buses, and only took taxis when we had walked too far. We recommend the Teaching Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lecture courses on the Louvre and the Impressionists before you visit Paris. They suggest spending only an hour or two looking at a few works of art in each museum in order to avoid burnout. This was a totally different approach from our previous European trips, and it worked superbly. There is too much to see in a week in Paris, so just select a few places and enjoy a small part of them at a relaxed pace. Other sights We enjoyed a day walking to St. Chapelle and Notre Dame and touring the two islands in the Seine. Another day we visited the Arc de Triumphe and walked along the Champs and to the Eiffel Tower. The Peugeot store on the Champs had the latest concept cars and cool tee shirts from the rugby championships the company was sponsoring in Paris this year. The restaurants and shops along Rue Marbeuf are first class. La Fermette de Marbeuf is a jewel not to be missed. Rick Steve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Paris 2008\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd came in handy for guiding us through the sights. There is so much to see that we could spend at least another year in Paris and not return to any place twice. We had no problem communicating with our meager 100 word French vocabularies. The neighborhood Welcome to heaven! Besides the unbelievable museums a few minutes away, the Westin, the Ritz, the Meurice and many upscale shops are within a block or two of the Renaissance. W.H.

I'm a Platinum member at the Marriott hotels, but received only a free breakfast: no cocktails, no internet access, no welcome drink. At breakfast, we were ignored by the staff until we literally had to peek into the kitchen to seek service. There was a false fire alarm at 10am on Sunday, and the staff didn't even bother to explain what was happening although guests were trooping down to the lobby in their bathrobes. Likewise, the concierge was not at his desk when I inquired about restaurant reservations. The receptionist literally said, \"It's not my job,\" before reluctantly helping me to call the restaurant.

As others have reported, the hotel is in a beautiful building on a nice, quiet street one block off the Rue de Rivoli. The location is amazing! We were five minutes from the Louvre or the Champs Elysees, two minutes from the Tuilleries Garden and its Metro station, and within easy walking distance dozens of great caf\u00c3\u00a9s, including Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Angelina with the best hot chocolate on the planet, not to mention the fun and friendly Carr\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Irish Pub across the street!

Was the room a bit small by American standards? Yes, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in smaller and this one was quite comfortable, with plenty of closet and storage space in the nice, wood wall units. There was ample room to move around, and the flat screen TV was very cool, especially with the DVD/CD player hooked into it (I could play my CDs through the TV!). Also, it was really nice having windows that opened, but they also sealed up tight and the double-paned glass did a great job keeping out what little noise there was. We also loved the queen-sized bed, from the foam pillows we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d requested in advance to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mattress to the soft, cozy comforter. I usually don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep well in hotels, but I slept great in this one! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read the comments about the showers, and this would be the only thing I might be tempted to complain about. I confess I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not clear on why they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just put in a shower curtain or a full glass door on the tub, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m assuming there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good reason. However, the bathroom was very nice and we adapted to the situation with very little effort. My wife decided to take a bath instead of a shower each morning while I shaved, and when it was my turn, we just put down the bath mat and her towel and that pretty much kept the floor dry (the towels are so huge, it covered half the floor anyway!). This was a very minor inconvenience and we were not bothered by it at all. The service was excellent. We took advantage of the free breakfast every morning, ordering pretty much whatever we wanted, and our meal was delivered promptly every morning at the time we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d specified the night before. We had a little trouble adjusting the A/C (which we needed because it was unseasonably warm the week we were there), but one call to the front desk took care of that. And, the concierge was very helpful, obtaining our museum passes for us and steering us to a nearby \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tabac\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the phone card we needed. And, the icing on the cake for this hotel is the pool! In a beautiful room decorated with tile and teak wood, it was actually a bit larger than I expected. It even has those big water \u00e2\u20ac\u0153jets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at one end so you can swim toward them and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re swimming laps without moving! Not that we were looking to exercise at the end of the day! The pool was the perfect way to relax after several hours of walking and admiring the sights and if you stay here, definitely take advantage of it.

Here are some details. Our stay: 2/18/07 - 2/24/07 Booking: Very easy - we used Marriott Reward Points Location: Excellent. A VERY short walk (5 minutes) from the Tuileries Metro station and only 10 minutes to the Louvre, 15 minutes to the D'Orsay, 45 minute walk up the Champs-Elysees to the Arc, about the same to the Eiffel Tower. Every thing could be walked to within one hour - but the easy Metro Access gave us many choices and the RER station at the D'Orsay gave us direct access to Versaille as well. ***Warning - the Metro ticket machines do not accept American Credit Cards or paper euros. If you plan to use the machine, bring coins. ****Warning #2 - the Tuileries metro ticket window was not open on Saturday morning at 7:30AM when we were leaving for the airport (CDG) - so without enough coin change, we were unable to buy tickets directly to the airport. It required exiting the system while still within zone 1 (which is all the change we had) to buy tickets to the airport from a staffed ticket booth. Check-in: Wonderful. Staff was very pleasant and had our room ready when we arrived at the hotel shortly after 12 Noon. Room: As advertised in other postings, a little small. Very nice, very modern (flat screen); but limited drawer space. Our room was on the first floor with a balcony to an interior courtyard. Very Quiet. Bathroom: Very nice, but again, as other postings have stated - the shower leaks a lot. This could be solved rather easily in my opinion by putting a flange on the bottom of the door to capture and redirect water back into the shower instead of allowing it to fall outside the door onto the bathroom floor. Smoked glass bathroom doors (both from the room and to the shower and toilet provide little privacy when the lights in the bathroom are on. There is enough ambient light though from the room, so when we wanted privacy, we just left the bathroom light off. Service: Excellent. If we left the Privacy sign on the door, we were left alone; even when we forgot, they always knocked and made sure that it was OK to come in. When we were out, the room was cleaned quickly and well; regardless if we had left the Privacy sign out all day and removed it at 6PM. Even at that hour they cleaned without our request. Nightly turn down service was also provided (when the Privacy sign was not on the door) with tasty chocolate suckers brought to the room. Price: As mentioned, we booked the room with Marriott Reward points, however, we upgraded to the Deluxe Room - which provided a larger room and a full breakfast for 3 of us each day. The charge for this upgrade was 60euro per day, which we considered reasonable. Restaurant: Breakfast - Wonderful - eggs to order or scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, toast, fruit, cheeses, sliced meats - we ate there everyday (to take advantage of our deluxe upgrade). Dinner - Very popular and the menu looked good, but the one night that we decided to eat there for dinner, there were no reservations available. This was fortunate for us as the Concierge recommended a wonderful neighborhood restaurant only 5 minutes walk down the same street - which served great food and even better atmosphere. Excercise Room, Spa, Pool - very nice. In the basement and underutilized. We enjoyed a relaxing swim and sauna. Overall - perfect for us.

There is also no place to unpack (no drawers, horrible use of space), and not even enough room to keep your suitcase on a rack. Second day there we awoke to no electricity in our room. We finally got reception to pick up the phone, and were told \"they'd get back to us\". A half an hour later someone showed up, said they hadn't realized whole block of rooms were without power (and air circulation) but they were getting it back on. There was never the slightest apology about this. The concierge is a waste -- the only bad meal we had in Paris was his recommendation, and the breakfast in the hotel, at 29 Euros, is insane -- and not much too it. There are numerous cafes in the area, while also pricey, offer a decent \"petit dejeuner\" for around 10 Euros instead. We used Marriott points so shouldn't complain this much, but friends stayed there as well and they were really ripped off. Believe me, we stayed at a hotel for half the price on the Left Bank, had a sense of true Paris, great, large room, with a view, impeccable service -- and the room rate was less than half of this. Don't settle for an inferior experience -- if you are only comfortable in chain hotels, Westin around the corner and the Hilton on the left bank (where rooms are also twice the size) are far superior choices. A horrible experience...", "Date": "February 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Droitwich, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat base for visit on foot\u201d", "Author": "IngsDroitwich", "ReviewID": "UR6789528", "Content": "Easy taxi from Orly, 35euro, yes smallish room but well presented and faced into the inner quad so very quiet.

This is a great hotel for married couples traveling alone, although I'm sure it's good for children as well. Oh, one other thing, we were there on Christmas Eve and Day and they brought us a box of German chocolate cookies. They were so good and I thought that was very kind of them.

Most all of the museums were open on Christmas Eve, including the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower is open on Christmas Day. We had no problem finding restaurants either.

The breakfast really started our day in the right direction. The only downside to our hotel was the construction of several shops on that street outside our window.

We had three rooms. The hotel is very nice, the staff were friendly and accommodating but I came away feeling \"nice, but..\" when I compare it with stays at other five-star hotels. On the \"nice\" side were the gym and swimming pool, both of which appeared very new, were not at all crowded (in fact most of the time we were the only ones in the pool which was lovely), with decent locker-rooms and showers. Flat-panels in all the rooms, and DVD players (but no evidence of a menu of DVDs to borrow although I didn't look that hard because we were out all the time so we didn't need in-room entertainment). Beds were very comfortable, with a very nice \"topper\" on the matress which is not that common but gives a luxury feel. On the \"but\" side: 1. We asked for interconnecting rooms so my kids (aged 6 & 8) could have their own room but get to us easily. We were initially given rooms separated by two other rooms - when we complained, we were moved to adjoining but not interconnecting rooms after one night. Not the end of the world, but even so annoying. 2. The bath robes were regularly removed from the room and not replaced, which was a bit annoying given we didn't have interconnecting rooms so if the kids wanted us in the middle of the night it is kind of handy to have a robe to put on when you step into the corridor. We asked repeatedly and eventually got robes but again, annoying to have to ask. 3. The one and only PC with internet connection in the lobby was out of action for our entire stay 4. One of the two lifts was out of action for most of our stay, meaning some competition with the bell-boys for elevator space 5. We asked for a taxi to collect us from Gare du Nord so we didn't have to sweat in line after a 3 hour train ride. This is a ten euro trip, but the hotel wanted me to pay 120 euro for their driver to collect us. I consider that an insult when the total budget for the week was already close to ten thousand euro. 6. Similarly, babysitting at 30 euro an hour plus 30 euros for taxi home is a rip-off: even the Biltmore in Miami which is a very expensive hotel, offers better value babysitting than that. 7. Breakfast was very expensive and they didn't seem to offer any reduction for children: both Le Meridien and Four Seasons typically offer children much cheaper breakfast than 29 euro.

We stayed in a prestige room, for which we paid 380 Euros a night, with breakfast included. The Room ------------ We were initially located room 101 overlooking the street, but because we and they couldn't get into the room safe, we were immediately transferred to room 314, overlooking the central courtyard. The rooms weren't as small as I was expecting given some of the comments in the reviews I'd read before flying out to France, although talking to the receptionists, they did say that some of the prestige rooms were smaller than the others. Room 314 was slightly smaller than room 101, but it had the advantage of a separate shower and bathtub, which room 101 didn't have. Rooms are well appointed, with an LCD style TV, DVD player, \"King sized\" bed, air conditioning, well stocked minibar, iron, good bathroom (but as reported before with frosted glass doors so not maximum privacy) and robes/slippers. The bed was very comfortable as was the bedding, with plenty of pillows. However be aware that in both prestige rooms we saw the King sized beds are in fact 2 single beds with single mattresses pushed together, so not a true King bed. Overall though we liked the room and it was perfect for our needs. I think they're better geared towards tourists than business travellers as the desk was small, but in future we'll choose a smaller room because we don't think, for the little time we spent in our room, that it was worth 380 Euros a night. A few grumbles about the room before I move on .... 1.) The new safe was on the top shelf in a cupboard, and therefore we couldn't see into it without standing on a chair. Clearly roomkeeping hadn't done this either as there were 2 whisky bottles on top of the safe. 2.) Excessive prices of minibar drinks: 6 Euros for a coke. It's pure greed. If my airline can charge me less than 1 Euro for a coke and make a profit, I don't expect a hotel to keep on this sort of nonsense. We therefore spent no money in the hotel on drinks, although I would have quite happily settled into a few cocktails each evening if I didn't feel that I was being ripped off. After all at 360 Euros a night, something we thought was somewhat excessive for the room size, the hotel could and should be generating a great deal of goodwill by offering drinks to hotel guests at much much cheaper rates. 3.) DVD rental. The LCD TV system doesn't offer movies so the hotel offers DVDs for hire for 10 Euros. I think all hotels could generate a great deal of goodwill if they dropped this stupid nonsense of overcharging for in-room movies. The Staff ----------- The staff were all excellent, spoke English well, and were a pleasure to deal with. The Breakfast ----------------- We choser to have our included breakfast in our room, for which there is no additional charge, although you're limited to choosing from the continental menu. So it's the usual selection of French pastries, cereals, and fresh fruit salad, which suited us well. However with the location of many cafes and restaurants in the surrounding area, in the future we'd choose to have breakfast away from the hotel. We can't comment on the breakfast in the restaurant as we didn't eat in there. The Pool and Gym --------------------- Ok well I don't do gyms, but there were about 8 or so pieces of high end equipment. The pool was excellent - small, but usable to exercise in and cool off. The pool has two adjustable underwater jets for those of us who like to exercise against a current. Wonderful! A very classy pool with slate and wooden surroundings. Note that whilst you can turn the jets on or off, they can be very powerful, and so children shouldn't be allowed to use them without supervision. As well as the pool and gym, there's a boiling steam room (the hottest I've ever experienced) and a sauna, plus shower. Location ---------- I agree with everything that everyone else has said about this hotel's location. A quiet street, in a lovely area of Paris, within a short walking distance to great shopping, sight seeing and famous landmarks. This is a perfect part of Paris to stay in. Would we return? --------------------- Probably, if we could get a better rate. For my money, the hotel's location, and the ability to have a swim at the end of a day's walking and shopping, are what will bring me back to this hotel, but as a said, so long as we can secure a better rate!", "Date": "July 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed Our Stay\u201d", "Author": "AureliaTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR5417140", "Content": "We just returned from a trip to France.

The breakfast is a buffet, and the staff will fix eggs for you, plus bring you coffee, hot chocolate, etc. The buffet consists of cereals, breads, and hams.

The location is excellent - you are in walking distance of the Louvre, the Orsay, the Place de Concorde and you are in the elite shopping district of Paris.

I booked on the internet and upgraded my booking because I wanted to give my wife a treat. I have to say that I was disappointed on several counts: 1. When I arrived the staff appeared unaware of the upgrade or what it entailed; 2. The upgrade was supposed to give me a bottle of champagne on arrival, but it was not to be had until asked for; 3. The room was small. I think this was the biggest disappointment. If they offer an upgrade for couples I think that the room ought to be a priority - but it was so small that my wife and I had to negotiate verbally before getting out of the bed because there was so little room. The bathroom was almost as big as the bedroom. Furthermore, I'm not pleased that the first thing they said to me when I checked in was that I could upgrade my room for 80 euros. Well, if you've already upgraded your booking, why should you have to upgrade again if you want a decent-sized room? So on balance, this is a very good hotel, but their marketing is, I think, annoyingly skewed. Either you upgrade, and you upgrade properly, getting a decent room, or you don't.

We stayed here 4 nights in Feb and were surprisingly upgraded to a room with a king size bed and 2 separate bathrooms (one with toilet, one with shower).

It is great to be in a new hotel in Europe.... so rare! All the bathrooms are modern but classy. Heated towel rack, Blvgari soaps, and 3 euro chocolates on your pillow every night all are nice touches. I read many complaints about the shower and it leaking on the floor.

Even the hotel signs are not illuminated, and when I arrived (after eleven) there was no-one at the small entrance. The lobby is no more imposing: it is relatively small and unassuming, although the dark hardwood and stone looks expensive. Still no porter after check-in, but the lift was 5 yards away so I carried my bags to the room with no trouble. I found the room moderately sized; the king bed dominated it, leaving little free floor space. Two built-in wardrobes gave plenty of room and I was pleased to see an iron and ironing board as standard, and off course the two sumptuous dressing gowns neatly folded. The desk had a light and a broadband connection; however the business traveller might find it a little small. Room enough for a laptop and a couple of sheets of paper, but not much more. The hotel must have blessed the invention of the flat screen TV hanging on the wall, because it is hard to see where a decent sized standard set would have gone. The bathroom was somewhat more generously sized. It had both a shower and bath, with separate toilet compartment and was nicely finished in marble, smoked glass and chrome, and spotlessly clean. The shower door seal leaked though (as other reviewers have pointed out) and mopping up after became a daily ritual for us. A worse problem though was to come: before settling down for the night we switched the a/c off to cut out the slight hum that appeared to be coming from it. Strangely, the hum continued. After a bit of investigation we discovered that the main fans for the hotel a/c were situated directly above our room. The noise was not that loud, but it was a bit like being on a George Lucas set with the constant low rumble of a star-destroyer main drive engine in the background. For the real noise though, we could open the room window \u00e2\u20ac\u201c now we get a noise of Ridley Scott proportions from the huge metal cooling duct that runs up the side of the hotel. Admittedly, we did not have much reason to open the window - the view was of a tiny courtyard. In the end though, it was not these things that put me off the hotel. The main disappointment was that the whole place was just too uninspiring. Some people write that it is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home from home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Well, if I am paying a month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mortgage for three days in a room a third of the size of my apartment, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to feel at home. I want something a bit swanky. I want guys with hats on the door, a big flashy atrium and some furniture that once belonged to Louis the umpteenth. This is Paris after all, and I want to see something of the glory of France in my hotel. And in case you think this can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be found, you need only wander around the corner to see the hotels nearby to see what I mean. Of course, there is the Maurice and the Crillon, for which you will pay more, but you can also find a few grand four stars that look pretty impressive. So, in the end I have to mark this hotel down. True, the staff could not have been friendlier. The spar was nice; I loved the black slate steam room and it is one of the few Paris hotels with a pool (though it is small). But I have to knock a small point off the problems in the room, and a big point off for being too plain, downright dull. A business traveller might find this OK, but if you are going to Paris for that once in a life-time trip, do yourself a favour and splash out a bit extra for a real five star, or save the cash and get a nice four star room with a decent view.

My husband and I stayed there for a week and a half in September 2005 and can't imagine liking a place better. We enjoy hotels that are high quality, classy, but comfortable and personal. This fit the bill perfectly. Location: If you are touring Paris, the vacation is very central. Right across from the Tuileries, Tuilieries metro stop (on a very central, convenient line), a block from the Louvre, the most wonderful boutiques and shopping right around the corner, restaurants, groceries and cafes everywhere, and yet the hotel is tucked into a side street so it is perfectly quiet. Somebody wrote a review that said there was nowhere to get food nearby. A half a dozen cafes with coffee, croissants, soda, and groceries weren't 20 paces away - they must not have explored thoroughly. Room: We stayed on the 1st floor in room 109. Our room was beautifully decorated with a very contemporary look. The furnishings seemed brand new. A little small, but had ample closet space so once we were unpacked, we had no trouble. We loved to cuddle in bed after a long day of touring and watch our flat screen tv. The bed was a comfy queen. Room was additionally furnished with a desk, desk chair, coffee table and arm chair. We had a bright beautiful window we could open during the day, but we didn't because the weather was around 85 degrees and we wanted to keep the awesome air conditioning running. Room was always flawlessly clean when we arrived back from touring during the day. The bathroom was the only difficulty we experienced, but we were prepared from the other reviews we had. The half glass panel in the shower guarantees a little leakage, but it was easily controlled with spare towels. The bathroom had plenty of counter space and was furnished with robes, a hair dryer, makeup mirror, etc. Toiletries were very nice and yummy smelling. Mini-bar in the room was well-stocked but ridiculously expensive (6 euros for a coke?) There was extra room in the fridge we filled with cheap water and coke from around the corner. The hotel staff didn't seem to mind. Food: We enjoyed room service two evenings which was fast by US standards (15 minutes or less), and ate one night at Pinxo. Food was very high quality and orders were always well understood, including special requests. Many other fantastic restaurants nearby. Spa & Pool: We took advantage of the wonderful spa and pool facilities while we were there, which were very unique for a European hotel. The pool was just as beautiful as it was in the pictures with lots of comfy seats for lounging. The workout room is small but functional, and we both had great massages in the spa area. Language: Everyone we met at the hotel: concierge, room service, spa workers, even cleaning staff had some command of English. While we made our polite efforts in broken French, they had no problem switching to English to help us out. Room would be great for couples, and maybe families who want to take advantage of the pool.

This is my 2nd stay in Paris and I am by no means a hotel snob - my normal 3 decision making requirements are - location,safety and quiet. The hotel scores well in all areas. Pros - Location - walking distance from all the sights (except sacre coueur). Perfectly positioned on a quiet side street means you don't hear traffic.(I am a light sleeper so this is a big point for me!) Rooms - big by paris standards. Very well laid out - everything looks and feels new and high quality from the bed to the linen to the desk. LCD tv and dvd player is also great when you get bored of the only 2 english news channels. Bulgari toiletries a nice treat. Bathrooms are nice and big. Broadband access included.bath robes and slippers handy for the pool. Amenities - Pool,sauna,steam room are fantastic after long walks. I only used them one night but we had the pool to ourselves....very nice Staff - Very helpful and pleasant. I didn't bother them too much except for the bill - more on that later. But as others have mentioned they make you feel extremely welcome and I think are the real icing on the cake for this hotel. Bad staff can leave a sour taste in a nice hotel but these guys were great ! Cons- location - if you need a quick fix of fruit or bottled water etc,it's quite a walk to find the nearest market. so shop when you're out in the day! the bathroom cannot be kept dry as mentioned previously...annoying maybe,but didn't bother me too much pool/sauna closes at 10pm...found we were out till that time most nights so would've liked to use it when we came back a couple of other oddities - I received a call from front desk at 7.30am one morning..when I answered they said \"sorry\" and hung up.... 2 bottles of beer appeared on the bill which I didn't have - only thing i can guess is by looking in the minibar they may be scanned and added automatically? the safe was advertised as \"laptop size\" but in reality it holds passports and maybe a camera. One reason I enjoyed this hotel so much was that I felt I got a bargain...The rack rate was 269eur but after booking I noticed expedia were offering it at 249. Marriott have a policy of \"best price\" which means if you find it cheaper than their site they give you a rate of the lower along with a 25% discount....so my rate was actually 182eur. Front desk hadn't been informed by bookings office,but once I was able to produce the email they were more than happy to oblige. I didn't use restaurant/bar so can't comment. One last recommendation for paris from me is use the Batobus !! 16eur for a 5 day pass - basically a boat along the seine with about 8 stops - hop on,hop off - all the major ones...by far the easiest way to go from champs elysees to eiffel, or eiffel to notre dame - and a great view along the way. the metro means walking,changing lines,not a nice view....boat is superb...runs till 10pm too so you can view the sights at night. only wish i'd discovered it at the beginning of my weekend ! I would definitely stay here again - great hotel,location,staff and I would recommend it. you'll feel a little pampered in this home away from home.

The location is just great, especially if you're into art as Musee d'Orsay and the Louvre are within easy walking distance. The hotel is perfectly styled and has a very nice ambiance, I felt at home immediately. It is also rather quiet, as it is on a back street of the very busy Rue de Rivoli. The room (I had a 'Prestige' room) was not very big, but I loved the extremely comfortable bed, the style and the flatscreen tv. The bathroom however is a typical case of 'design over function', which starts with the doors (which aren't really doors); and as other reviewers mentioned, it is impossible to take a shower without flooding the room. The Bulgari toiletries on the other side are wonderful. Housekeeping was not very good: the room was not ready when I arrived at 5pm and was also made late the next day, the mini bar didn't get refilled, a drinking glass was not cleaned, they knocked at the door once despite the 'do not disturb' sign; all nothing severe but it's not nut truly five star standard. The turndown service however was lovely. The Pool and Hamam are fabulous features after a long day of walking around in Paris, and again with great design. I liked the small but cozy bar. The restaurant is a bit expensive but very good with creative, quite light food. I enjoyed sitting at the marble bar where you can watch the cooks preparing the meals. Breakfast however is hopelessly overprized for the variety and quality of the food offered. I don't mind paying 29 Euro for a breakfast buffet, but for that money I expect more. Go to the Meurice nearby if you want to spend money for breakfast, else there are enough French cafes around to start the day. In addition, staff in the restaurant at breakfast wasn't overly polite and sometimes very stressed, and argued in front of the guests with each other about having too much work to do. Last but not least, the best thing about this hotel is the front desk staff, everybody was extremely nice and helpful. Top notch service! Although there are some little downsides, I rate the hotel with five stars for the style, the staff, the location and the pool, and also because with the exception of the George V all five star places in Paris (including the Ritz and the Crillion) I've tried so far had bigger problems than this one.

They were always there with a pleasant \"bon jour\" and smiles. The pool, sauna and hammam (steam room) were an added bonus. It was really nice to be able to come back to the hotel after a long hot day, and jump in the pool. A couple of mornings I used the facilities before we went out, and I used the locker room to shower and shave, giving my wife some space in the room to get ready. My only compaint was that the steam room was out of service a couple of times, but when it was working it was awsome with the tiny starlights ceiling. In summary, I would recommend this hotel.
