This is not a luxury hotel and possibly would not be my first choice for a romantic weekend but is ideal for somewhere to sleep after a busy day in the city.The sheets are clean and tidy. Other hotels in the vicinity charge at least three times the price. Traffic noise may be a problem for some but I am usually too tired to notice so sleeping here is not a problem for me and normally I live in the countryside. A vast selection of places to eat are very close at hand. There are information guides available by the reception desk. I think that some people booking this hotel will have seen erroneous and misleading information on some websites. It may also be confused with another hotel with the same name in Paddington , photos of which have also been wrongly displayed. Gresham Hotel , Bloomsbury, is a two star hotel, without a lift and it does not serve breakfast. Check in is at three pm.

Our cases were left next to a filing cabinet in a tiny corridor behind the desk. This was sort of unprofessional but i didn't see it as that big a deal.

Room looked like it was in dire need of some tlc there wasn't even any duvets. Went back and politely asked to switch rooms, we were offered another room in the building, number 12 which upon first impression looked okay, until we saw the bathroom and a pile of dead flies in the shower. At this point we went back and asked for a refund. Clearly the guy didn't believe us because he checked, came back and said \"oh it's only some flies!\" probably not very wisely I lost my temper at this point and had a huge argument with them. Extremely rudely they spoke about my friend and I in Indian to each other while we were stood right there. Apparently refunds take 8-12 days to go through. Again something I found difficult to believe as we had only done the transaction on a card machine a half hour earlier.

Having been toasted and buttered it was edible.\u201d", "Author": "Headley1974", "ReviewID": "UR115956973", "Content": "Having read all the reviews I decided to keep an open mind prior to booking the room, as people tend to judge by their own standards or by what they are accustomed to. Having searched the net, I realised that trying to get a room in central London was going to be expensive. The budget I had for a double room for me and my mate was \u00c2\u00a360. We wanted to be as close to Leicester square as possible, and found that rooms around this area cost around double and upwards. The nearest alternatives were Victoria, paddington and kings cross, which would have meant an expensive taxi ride after a night out. The Gresham Hotel is in the perfect location. Two mins to walk to Tottenham court rd. And 5 mins or so to Leicester square. Now having checked in we were allocated a room on the 4th floor. This meant a steep climb up three flights of stairs. Which is great if you want to lose a few pounds but not if your unfit. The female receptionist wasn't friendly or engaging but didn't come across rude either. She handed over the key and advised that it had to be returned when leaving the hotel which I found really strange, however she advised that this because they opened 24 hours. My immediate concern was for my valuables therefore I made sure that I kept wallet etc on my person. The room was a decent size twin. With a basin And small table. The decor was basic. There were clean towels and bedding. The room had a faint musty smell which you didn't notice after a while. Outside there was a shower room and a toilet. Both were clean but the shower had a faint odour. I believe this was coming from the shower trap/drain or possibly the curtain. It was'nt unpleasant. Due to the fact that my friend has trouble climbing stairs as he's a big lad I decided to request a change of room as I was meeting him a few hours later. By this time there was a different receptionist called Ryan. He was fantastic and accommodating. He gave me the choice of two rooms a double and a twin on the first floor. They were both clean but smaller rooms. The double was a reasonable size. And the twin was long and narrow with the beds back to back. I chose the twin as didn't fancy sharing a bed with my mate! My only gripe with this room was that the mirror light was broken which was frustrating as it was difficult to shave as it was getting dark. Also the bed was a bit springy for me but my mate was happy. As it was a warm day we had to leave the window open, so you could hear traffic. But as we both strolled in at 4.am it didn't matter as we were both out for the count! The only annoying thing was that we had to wait 10 mins after buzzing the door to be let back in the hotel. Overall I would say that \u00c2\u00a355 for a double room was excellent considering the location. If we had elected for an en suite room it would have cost \u00c2\u00a375. The hotel next door was charging \u00c2\u00a3125 for a double. Now this hotel has zero luxuries but offers cheap accommodation in the heart of London on the exclusive Bloomsbury rd. If your prepared to lower your standards for a night or two then I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. It was clean but very basic. No breakfast, kettle, mugs, glasses or iron. What you see is what u get. Now I can't swear to this but I think I may have been bitten once or twice, however this happens occasionally in my own house as I have two dogs and a cat, so it's an occupational hazard and therefore didn't phase me. To put things in to perspective I noticed several homeless people sleeping rough on the streets in the early hours of the morning. To those who say it would be better to sleep outside haven't got a clue.

The room was clean so was the shower and toliet (although these were seperated from our room and shared). It is just a basic hotel with basic rooms and facilities. I'm not sure if the other people who have written reviews were expecting a 5 star palace but you get what you pay for and this place was perfect for us for the cheapest price in a fantastic location.

Be aware that even though you give your card details online, you do not pay until you get there which we were not aware of so we were \u00c2\u00a370 down on spending money before we even got out the door! The language barrier between ourselves and the staff was awful. It was very hard to communicate anything. Also the staff were quite rude and very unhelpful. We had book a twin en suite room. The beds were small, and the matressess were terrible, all the springs had gone in mine so it was very uncomfortable. They didnt have duvets, we slept under a wooley blanket and a double bed throw doubled over. I overheard another customer complaining that they had booked a double room and turned up to a twin, the receptionist said they did not have any double beds at all and would push two singles together for them. So beware if expecting a double room! Its in a great location for all sight seeing, theatres and public transport so that is one bonus. The 'en suite' was tiny, dull and dirty. The sink and bedee' had cracks in them, the shower was small and rusty and we had no hot water in shower or from the taps. So it was a cold shower/wash or nothing. Now the worst bit- during the night I heard a rustling in a bag on the floor, turned on the light and saw a huge mouse run over to the chair and up my coat. I was horrified, woke my boyfriend and asked him to keep an eye on it whilst I went to tell reception. The gentleman behind reception spoke even less English than the man that booked us in. He said he was unable to move us to a different room, for some reason I could not understand. He came down to the room on my insistance so he could get the mouse out. By that time it had gone under the floor boards through a hole by the radiator. I refused to stay in the room and all he said was ' it probably wont come out again!!' I insisted he move us to another room, which he did in the end, but it was 5 flights of stairs up, no lift and no help with luggage from him. I asked him what time the manager was in the next day and he said 7am. When we got to the new room we realised it was not en suite and we had to share the bathroom and shower. Which was not what we paid for. The beds up here were even worse, there was a sink in the room that was persistanly dripping no matter what we did, the window did not close properly and there was stil no hot water. In the morning we did not want to stay for breakfast as the room with the mouse was right next door to the kitchen so god knows what it was like in there. When we checked out it was the same gentleman that had checked us in. He was not aware of the mouse or room switching that had happened during the night. I explained all of this to him and he said there was nothing he could do as the manager was not in until 5pm!! A very different time to the 7am that the gentleman in the night had said! We happend to be walking near the hotel at 4pm later that day so decided to go in and see if the manager was there, she was. She also was not aware of the complaint that we had put in at check out. So I had to explain everything again to her. She then said there was nothing she could do because all complaints have to be dealt with at check out. She said to email the hotel and see what happens.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rare that I would rate a hotel experience as terrible (one or two perhaps out of those thousand hotels) but, unfortunately, our recent stay in the Gresham was truly awful. I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bore you with my personal take on the atmosphere at breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but I would criticise the Gresham, compared to other hotels available in the area, for the following reasons which I think are pretty fundamental points for a pleasant stay: - Location - Value for money - Cleanliness - Security The Gresham is located on Bloomsbury at \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the noisiest junction on the street; particularly if you are based in the annex as we were. Hence, traffic noise surpasses the point of irritating which you may find at the Jesmond, Arosfa or Ridgemount and reaches the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunbearable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. In terms of value for money, the Gresham is more expensive than neighbouring hotels, but offers less right across the board. Perhaps the only advantage is the shorter walk down into 7 Dials. Our room, and the various corridors and stairwells we saw, were dirty. The clump of hair we found on the bathroom floor next to the unemptied bin was so big it could have been given a name and a collar and we could have taken it to the vets for its shots. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t venture into the shower; we thought it was safer not to. One of the three pillows was confined to the floor as we were sure that it had served the previous residents of our room. Finally, and perhaps the most serious point, security. The window of our room could not be closed. This meant that neighbouring rooms had access to our room via an adjoining balcony. This \u00e2\u20ac\u201c obviously \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bothered us, so we deposited our valuables at reception and asked to have the window fixed. When we returned, we were informed that the handyman was unavailable, and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153since you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only staying one night\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We suggested that the problem would \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also \u00e2\u20ac\u201c apply to the next night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guests and offered to fix the window ourselves if they gave us the tools. No tools. We headed up to the room to find the window wide open. We closed it and left the hotel, returning some hours later to find the window wide open once more. When we discovered that a piece of jewellery had been stolen from our room, we informed the hotel reception. There was no comment. There was no apology (and neither of us look like lawyers, believe me). When you book a hotel, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to have to go out and buy a tool kit to secure your room. Not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at this price, and with cheaper, and safer, hotels just a stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throw away.
