Location wise the place is great.. very close to Rialto, and just about 10 mins from San Marco. Yet, quiet and peaceful. The interiors are very nice, plush and modern. Furniture, fittings etc.. all great. When we reached venice, we thought we would need to buy some groceries like Milk, bread, butter etc.. since we were traveling with kids and we needed all that... but to our surprise, the place was stocked with everything we could need.. right from bread, milk, butter to meats and cookies, juice, cereals etc... AWESOME! and they replenish whatever you finish! The Hosts - wonderful people. Elisabeth was so helpful and sweet, and so were the others. Very friendly, helpful, informative.. Staying at this place was the best decision.. thanks to my wife who found it online!

It really made our stay in Venice remarkable. From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out, we had incredible service. In fact, I would stay here for a month or two if I could. It exceeded our expectations in every way. We stayed in Unit 9, which apparently was just recently remolded and you can tell. It's so well done, so clean, very sleek. There were 4 of us, 2 of us took the bedroom and 2 took the pull out couch ( which by the way was very comfortable). Having a washer for our laundry was so helpful, and though we didn't need the dishwasher - if you were cooking here, I can see where this would be advantageous. PROS: Location is great. Super close to Rialto, only a 5 min walk from the bridge. Centrally located to all different areas, and walking distance to great restaurants, shopping, supermarket, etc. We loved the apartment. Newly renovated, clean, updated furniture, comfortable bed and pull out couch, very large rooms, large bathrooms, large shower area (finally - somewhere in Italy with space). AC was in strong working condition, staff were all very helpful and super friendly. Easy to find! Our room looked over the canal and was on the ground level. It was spectacular. We loved opening the windows eating breakfast watching the morning routines of the locals. Affordable! Very reasonable in price. Free wifi! Breakfast snacks included and furnished every morning. CONS: I really don't have any. The only thing that might be considered a con would be the noise in the early mornings over the canal. It can get busy with the boats, gondolas, in and out of the canal and the unit we had was just over the water. It didn't bother us because we're from NYC so we're used to the noise, but some may find it bothersome. The wireless would occasionally go out. When it did, we just asked the front desk to re-set it. It was strong in the mornings and at night, but we found usually had to be re-set around mid-day. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat. I can't wait to go again, and will ask for the same apartment. It's SO AFFORDABLE - it's 100% worth the affordable price.

We reached late in the night from Rome by Train. We have booked this hotel through a website. On the door they have a slip in our name. When we entered we heard a voice please come upstairs. When we met the person we felt so comfortable. When we have seen the room we were so happy as it was a apartment and they have a kitchen also and we can cook Indian Food on our own. It is situated near to a canal and you may sit and see people doing Gondola Rides. When the hotel people know that it was our honeymoon they kept a bottle champagne in our room on the second day when we went for the sightseeing. Very close to the center of Venice. I would highly recommended Residenza Favaro.", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Fabulous place to stay\u201d", "Author": "momofmombo", "ReviewID": "UR105032975", "Content": "We changed hotels in venice online at the last minute because of what I read on trip advisor. we were not disappointed.

The accomodation was very clean and spacious and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was at the sister hotel, Hotel Bruno, which was only a 5 minute walk away. We also did a walking tour of Venice, which we booked through Viator, and we would recomend doing this as it was very imformative and it also helps you find your way around if you have not been to venice before. There is also a great little restaurant on the other side of rialto bridge, just at the foot of the stairs crossing over the bridge. The view from there at night is just gorgeous!!

We bought fresh seafood and pasta at the Rialto markets and cooked up a feast in our apartment. It was a good change as we were away for a month and we had been eating out almost every night. We stayed for 3 nights. We caught public transport in from the train station and found the hotel reasonably easy with the provided hotel map we received in email when we booked. We got a private water taxi in departure which Patrizia organize for us. It was a good way and hassle free way of getting to the airport. A tad more expensive, but its good to splurge sometimes.

Having looked at many of the hotels in Venice I realised that I'd either have to spend a fortune or really compromise on space (some rooms I'd seen photos of practically had the bathroom in the bedroom), not so with Ca'Foscolo! We stayed in Apartment 2 and honestly couldn't have asked for anything more. From arrival we were impressed that Paulo took the time to mark on a map where the local supermarket was along with wine shops, a takeaway pizza place (Crazy Pizza, love it!) and local restaurants. The apartment (2 - a double bed apartment) was lovely and spacious (photos attached) and we couldn't have been more impressed. One of the best bits was the fact that we had access to a kitchen which meant that in a morning we could enjoy a cup of tea and fresh bread bought from a local bakery. Although service of the apartment is only every 3 days you can pay an extra 50euros for daily service, we didn't bother though and in fact it was quite nice to not feel like you had to vacate the room for a certain time everyday so that the room could be cleaned, we felt like we were at home. The location is fantastic and ony minutes from the Rialto and St Mark's which meant that so much of the city was accessible on foot with practically no effort. There are also no end of good restaurants in the vicinity. It's the little touches that made this place so special like the fact that they have welington boots to borrow if acqua alta becomes a possibility or the fact that you get to walk in and see gondolas float by the boat entrance to the apartment.", "Date": "May 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sandy, Utah", "Title": "\u201cExcellent choice for families with any age of children!\u201d", "Author": "SmiggsMom", "ReviewID": "UR63278658", "Content": "We stayed at Ca'Foscolo in the two bedroom, one bath, kitchen with sitting and dining room unit.

The apartment was clean, fully-functioning , and well-managed. We caught up on laundry one small load at a time. We shopped at the nearby Rialto open market for delicious fresh foods and then cooked them at the apartment . They were some of our favorite meals from our entire trip. The staff is very friendly and helpful without being intrusive. Use their maps to find the residence. You will need them, especially if you arrive at night and take the vaporetto from the train station. Water taxis are much more expensive than the vaporetto, and the vaporettos provide a lovely ride with a short walk to the residence. We bought several three-day vaporetto passes and used them almost exclusively to get around Venice. My kids loved riding them.

So much more interesting than just a regular lobby .. how often do gondolas float by a lobby!??! Was great to be able to come and go throughout the day as the location is prefect for exploring the area. Came back for lunch, back before dinner and then to get warmer clothes before heading to San Marco square to listen to the bands! Our apartment did not have a washer - would have very nice! The 'twin beds' turned out to be 2 mattresses in one bedframe done up in separate bedding but basicaly one bed! Our teenagers of different genders dealt with it but it wasn't what we expected. The one bathroom had to be the smallest one I've ever seen but it was very clean and sufficient. The sofa bed sqeaked but it was comfortable. The location is very central but the alley between Hotel Bruno and the Residenza is very dark and deserted-feeling. Returning in the evening after the few shops had closed up was kind of creepy. I realize that Venice is a pretty safe city but I would not have wanted head down the alley as a single female after dark. Better to come at it from Rialto.
