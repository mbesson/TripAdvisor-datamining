There was also a large bath room with a bath tub. Overall the rooms were clean, tidy and had a nice feel to it. The carpet was stained but that's something I don't mind if everything else is clean. The double bed consisted of two single beds so that was a bit of a let downer as the \"double bed\" constantly had a gap in between no matter how often we pushed both beds together. The bath tub was great although shower curtains were missing. So after a shower the bath was too wet and not enough towels were there to dry the floor after myself. The family room itself was a converted 2 bed room flat and it was at the back of the hotel. I didn't mind as we had some privacy away from the other rooms and yet a hotel service. The staff was friendly and efficient. The location is superb due to the train system right outside the hotel. Onkel Lee to the right side of the hotel is a Chinese Take Away and I can recommend the Chinapfanne for 3 Euro. The D\u00f6ner Kebab place on the corner to the left is also worth recommending. Because there are plenty of trains to catch outside the hotel you can head to whatever restaurant you like to get a proper dinner. We stayed for 75 Euro a night and would definitely return in the future.", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thessaloniki", "Title": "\u201cGood choice\u201d", "Author": "DespoinaThessaloniki", "ReviewID": "UR77982397", "Content": "Nice Hotel with metro station just across the street, There are some alcoholics but there is police everywhere so you feel safe.

The hotel is in a shabby neighboorhood with lots of alcoholists, but they are all over the city and don't bother anyone. Across the hotel is station Lichtenberg, where the S-bahn takes you downtown in about 20min.(dayticket 6.10Euro p/p). At arrival we friendly greeted , and we were given a room at the top floor. This room was bad maintained, and it was like an oven in there (there's no airco in the entire hotel). It was 30C, and sleaping with the windows open was no option because of the traffic noise. Also there were no curtains, which meant waking up(if you could sleep because of the heat) by daylight. I complained and was given another room on the 2nd floor, which was a lot cooler. The breakfast is just that. Nothing fancy. The parkingspace behind the hotel is very small with room for 8 cars, and a very, very small entrance!! I recommend going to the Thai restaurant just around the corner.( 10% discount for hotelguests). The pizzeria down the street is good aswell. Comparing to the prices from the downtown hotels, this will just do, but on a next stay i would probably pay a bit more and go somewhere else.", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Finland", "Title": "\u201cA great hotel in Berlin\u201d", "Author": "KELPO", "ReviewID": "UR17450403", "Content": "Excellent hotel near Lichtenburg s-bahnstation.
