Right across from the Artis (zoo), very easy to get to by tram, bus, or water taxi. The rooms are average to large in size according to Amsterdam standards, and are kept very clean. What you will get here is a nice room in a quiet neighborhood, with a clean bed and bathroom. What more do you need? If you plan on spending your whole trip in a hotel room this may not be the place for you, but if you are an adventurer and just need a crash pad, this is perfect. I can't believe one reviewer said the location isn't great, they couldn't be more wrong. This part of town has everything, if not more, than any other part of town, and it isn't as crowded as some of the other central areas. Very close by you will find many restaurants; Turkish, Italian (great pizza), Chinese, Indian, Indonesian, Thai, French, and Dutch. Also a bakery, butcher shop, super market, and milk shop. There are also several first rate attractions right outside the front door; The Artis (zoo), the Resistance Museum, Werthiem Park, the Hortus Botanicus, and the University of Amsterdam. Also within walking distance is the Rembrandthuis Museum (where Rembrandt lived). There are several cafes to choose from; Eik en Linde, Tros Muziek Cafe, and right on the corner (the street level floor of the building) is the wonderful Cafe Koosje. Down the street towards the Hortus Botanicus is also one of the best coffeeshops in town, Het Ballonettje. Every room has a private shower/bathroom, color TV, hair dryer, safe, and a fridge. There is also fresh coffee and soft drinks available in the lobby, plus internet, telephone, and fax service. All in all, Hotel Plantage is a good bargain for your buck, especially in this part of town, just down the street there are rooms that go for twice as much. Not a luxury type of place, but you will be comfortable and save a lot of money by staying here.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cAdequate accommodation\u201d", "Author": "SKDLondon", "ReviewID": "UR122654897", "Content": "Stayed at Hotel Plantage in October with a group staying in 4 rooms.

There is also free internet in reception. This DOES work, ignore people who say it doesn't. There are NOT marks all over the walls at all. The hotel is clean, private and very quiet at night.

The room was filthy. There were bugs on the sheets. There were marks all over the walls. There was hair and other stuff left from the previous occupant. The drain didn't work, leaving an inch of water across the bathroom floor (the floor is all tile, and no separation for the shower). And on top of all that, the staff accused me of blackmail. We had traveled to Amsterdam from Germany. This hotel was a sort of last resort as everything was either booked up, or more than 120 euros per night. Because of this, we dealt with the room and its problems. But I took photos (I've posted them here, but haven't seen them show up yet). Upon checkout, I showed the staff the photos of our room. At first they seemed concerned, calling it a \"major\" problem. Then when I asked for a refund, things turned for the worse. The staff took on an attitude that I was trying to scam them. \"The spider could have flown in through an open window.\" \"Why did you wait until morning to tell us these problems?\" \"Now you are here trying to blackmail us.\" \"If you saw poor reviews, why did you book with us?\" Yes, I traveled more than 5,000 miles to Amsterdam to blackmail a small hotel. [/sarcasm] It was surreal. The staff was blaming the problems on the guest for not being more vigilant in selecting the hotel. The fact that there were bugs, a filthy room, and a bathroom drain that didn't work were normal. It was us, the guests, that were at fault.

Both were friendly, but the staff member much more friendly, he spoke great English and had lots of advice and tips to offer us. There was free internet in the reception area which was handy. There was also plenty of vending machines in the reception area which I'm sure come in quite handy for some... To get to our room, it was a steep descent up the very narrow flight of stairs. This was incredibly difficult with a backpack on - I thought I was going to topple backwards! The room was okay, clean enough I suppose.

The bathroom was a little weird, they supply a tub of liquid soap but we didn't use that. There was no shower curtain so everything got wet, even the toilet. Speaking of the toilet, it had one of those weird glass seats with shells etc in it. I'm just glad it wasn't one that had spiders in it. Thought it was broken and you had to hop on and off again very carefully. The neighbourhood itself is lovely. It's leafy, busy with families, a short stroll into the heart of Amsterdam.

On our last day, Plantage held our bags for us free of charge as we weren't leaving Amsterdam until that night on the overnight train up to Copenhagen.

We were in the attic room and didn't feel very safe at all, high up at the top of the building with no views of other buildings, people etc. For two girls barely over 20 we would of liked to have been somewhere where we could sense civilisation, as we felt very isolated and unsafe. The rooms decor doesn't help u relax either!Our room was painted in the brightest red I've ever seen with grafitti spotted about the place, and overall had a really eerie feel. Since the hotel was only for one nights kip we weren't too bothered, but the shower facility was a bit of a joke, its true that you could brush your teeth, have a shower and go for a wee all at the same time! As for the reviewers who said it was 'fantastic' etc all I can say is what is wrong with you?! YES it is a cheap hotel and doesnt claim to be a five star or anything, but we weren't expecting to feel unsafe and the room to be vandalised and musty. Overall it is fine for a (very) short stay if all your wanting is a bed, but I would advise people with claustrophobia and young women to stay away if they like to feel comfortable.", "Date": "August 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent cheap accomodation\u201d", "Author": "matt059", "ReviewID": "UR20645793", "Content": "We found this hotel above average. rooms were clean and relatively large for any European hotel. we were staying on the third floor and yes there are a few stairs but its Europe!! reception staff were friendly and more than willing to help. hotel has free wi-fi which was great. really good location - short walk to supermarket and restaurants, tram line to city centre less than 2 minutes walk away. no noise from pub below at all, even with window open all night. would stay here again.", "Date": "October 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cDont stay here!\u201d", "Author": "rich069", "ReviewID": "UR19913819", "Content": "Stayed one night in this hotel , terrible , the room was smelly and in a poor state of decoration .

This is not included in the price of Amsterdam hotels and whatever website you booked through should have informed you of this. We got a printed receipt so maybe you should ask for one if it's that much of a problem. While waiting the guy gave us \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1 each for a coffee/soft drink and we checked our emails on the free internet. At no point thriughout the whole stay did anyone in reception smoke anything. When the room was ready we went up to the top floor and dropped our stuff.

If you want an elevator then DON'T GO TO AMSTERDAM!!! We had the small twin attic room on the top floor, my only complaint would be the same as i saw in a previous review... the drain in the toilet really smelt! EW! We were told if we wanted the room cleaned to inform staff before 12pm on the day but we only stayed 3 nights so we didn't require new towels etc. The free internet was mostly always free, you receive a key to come and go as you please, the bar below is SO NOT ROWDY! We went in and it was a nice quiet restaurant. Not too far out from all the action, about a 10min walk or probably a 2min tram ride. We had a big window we kept open most of the time.

He was taking advantage of several customers that were white Americans, I think. Room was not clean, straight out of a junk yard set-up, winding stairs made it impossible to get the luggage up to the rooms and no help with it either from the hotel staff, bed sheets were dirty as if some had used them before we got there and had urine spots, carpet was infected with mold and bugs, red bed bugs were under the sheets and in the mattress, entire hotel was filled with smoke, no a/c and no windows in the room, absolutely unsafe location due to a hoodlum bar underneath the hotel, and building design, if you are a women or with a women definitely do not stay here, and staff was always smoking joint and cigarettes. It is better to stay in any hotel than this one because no other place could be any worse. I think the owner is from middle east and hates foreigners in general, but Americans in particular.

Staff was incredible. Very helpful and great to chat with. Anyone thinking otherwise should perhaps check their own attitudes. It was a short walk to all the shops and Central.
