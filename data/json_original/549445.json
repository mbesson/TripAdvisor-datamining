After reading a few of the reviews posted on tripadvisor, we booked the room.... we were not dissapointed. When we first got there, I was pleasantly suprised to find out they had upgraded us into a superior queen bed room and that there was a nearby parking lot where guests at the hotel get a discounted rate of 21-25$ per day of parking. On top of everything, there is free wi-fi offered at the hotel which is a nice bonus. The room was very spacious, clean and comfortable. Bathroom was also very clean with a standup shower. Bed was superb! The location of the hotel is really hard to beat. 5 minute walk to Copley square (which connects to the Prudential Centre) for shopping was very conveniant. 2 minute walk to the Back Bay Station which, through the commuter rail, gives you FREE access to south station, which puts you near quincy market and other touristy locations. We walked back to the hotel from quincy market and it only took us about 25minutes. There are very few negative things I can say about this hotel. However, the walls were very thin and we were able to hear other people's conversations through them. Secondly, whenever a toilet would flush (ours or others), there would be a loud thump in our room however this could have been just due to our room's location in relation to the pipes. Last, I found that a lot of light from the hallway would bleed into our room from the doorway (but a towel placed under the door helped). Overall the Hotel 140 is really hard to beat in regards to location or value.

I don't think we could have made a better choice. Upon check-in, the receptionist, Israel, told us we had an upgraded room, which was amazing, and was kind enough to provide a map and recommend some local places with great food. (Highlights were Thornton's for breakfast on a sunny morning and Trident Bookseller's & Cafe, where you must try the mushroom-fig sandwich.) We knew we didn't need five-star luxury, just a place to sleep, but were pleasantly surprised by a hotel that is clean, relaxing, and has very comfortable beds. The yellow hallways give the hotel a happy vibe, and the bathrooms are done in white tile that didn't have me questioning the cleanliness. The hotel has free WiFi, unlike some other local hotels that charge you. We had breakfast in the cafeteria downstairs and were happy with the good price and convenience. The hotel is about 200 feet from Back Bay Station on the Orange line, which was very convenient for taking Amtrak in, and about a quarter mile from Copley on the Green line. This made getting back very easy, even with unpleasant winter weather. The hotel is very close to Newbury Street, Trinity Church, and the Boston Public Library and within easy walking distance of the Prudential Center, Museum of Fine Arts, and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, all of which I would recommend visiting. This meant we saved a lot of money by walking instead of taking the Subway.

While my first stay earlier that month had been excellent, i was curious to see if my repeat experience would be as positive. It absolutely was. My request for a specific room was honored, largely due to the responsiveness of front desk representative Israel. He welcomed me back to the hotel, by name, and made sure that my reservation details were in order. He \"gets it\" when it comes to hotel hospitality and does much to promote this hotel. Part of the reason for my stay was to deliver gift basket items for my daughter and her fiance, who were arriving the following day for a stay that was a Christmas gift from my wife and me. Hotel manger Abraxas could not have been more gracious or accommodating as I worked on arrangements for their stay. She mailed me some items that I could wrap as a present and personally oversaw their reservation and room assignment. She made sure she touched base with me when I arrived to drop off the gift basket items. With one of the items being a bottle of wine, I was concerned about wine glasses. When I mentioned this to Israel, he assured me that they would find two glasses and have them in their room. He delivered, as promised. You might find more glamorous (and pricey) hotels in Boston, but I challenge anyone to find a hotel that is more committed to the satisfaction of their guests than Hotel 140.

It was a great find, in the heart of the city, in the backbay area but within blocks of newbury street and boston commons. The building itself is home to a small stage theater Lyric Stage, which adds to the charm. The building looks look a remodeled apartment building, with a nice spiral staircase in front, a small cafe, and a very pleasant looking lobby and counter. The ambiance is great. The rooms upstairs, however, were lacking. The bedsheets were minimalistic, the bathroom was small and the tiles were not flattering. The room was very small (150 sq ft), and there was no closet or desk - though, admittedly, there wasn't enough space for one. Furthermore, they listed on their website as having a workout room, but the room itself was smaller than our hotel room, and included one eliptical machine, and one bicycle machine. There was nothing else there. The price was amazing for the location, and we used an ipad app to get an even more reduced price for the night. Most boston hotels in that area, regardless of decor, cost twice as much as we were asked to pay. Given all that, we were more than happy with our stay, but the hotel is lacking in the more refined touches of some of the other downtown boston hotels that you might come upon in your searches.

We tried to bring this up with the front desk, who washed their hands of it, saying the cafe was not run by the hotel - ludicrous answer to give when that is where they send their guests for breakfast!! Aside from the above, our stay was fine. Room was small, and not all that quiet - despite my request for a quiet room. Not because walls were thin but because we were overlooking the street - from reading other reviews I gather a room overlooking a courtyard might have been a possibility. Location was good. There were no coffee/tea making facilities in the room, which I consider an essential, particularly in any hotel claiming to be 2 stars or above. They pretend they provide free coffee/tea, but this was only available in the mornings and only in the foyer - not in the room where you eat 'breakfast'. Customer service-wise, out of the 4 members of staff we encountered, only one was friendly and helpful, a lady with glasses. I reiterate several previous reviews' comments re key cards - hardly work and the help received with these is a joke, particularly as they clearly have issues with them all the time. We certainly would NOT recommend this hotel to anybody seeking a relaxing, enjoyable stay in Boston. Would be fine for anyone there on business who was just in and out for one night.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "katamo22", "ReviewID": "UR116264064", "Content": "It is a basic hotel, I definitely wouldn\u00c2\u00b4t call it boutique.

I would give it a higher rating if it weren't for some pretty extreme cluelessness in the customer service department. The hotel is in the Back Bay area of Boston, a very attractive part of Boston with a number of good hotels, restaurants, and shops. It's not tourist central, but it's very close to most of the main tourist attractions either by way of a short subway ride (use Back Bay station just south of the hotel) or though longer but pleasant walks through Boston's downtown neighborhoods. Geographically, it splits the difference between the historical attractions near the waterfront and the two major art museums in the Fenway area -- probably slightly closer to the latter. If your main interest is in colonial history you'll probably want to stay closer to the waterfront. The location is not as prime as some more expensive Back Bay hotels but it's really only steps away from prime Back Bay and it really doesn't matter. We booked (and pre-paid) several nights in a Superior King room. The decor in the King rooms is basic, but the room we had was clean and attractive and light-filled with a good exterior view. There is free wifi but it is somewhat unreliable. There are also old-fashioned ethernet jacks and you may (or may not) get better results if you bring a wired device and an ethernet cable. We had only wireless devices, so I don't know. For reasons that are unclear, they had mistakenly booked us for a standard room with a double bed. They couldn't switch us on the first night, so we experienced the standard room on the first night. The standard room we had was smaller, with an interior view, and (oddly) a dark olive green colour that made it look smaller than it was. Not recommended. The King room is much nicer and not all that more expensive. They switched us to the King room on the morning of our second day. I asked them about a refund of the difference for our first night and they said they would get back to me. They didn't have an answer for me at checkout and I gave them my phone number. They still haven't gotten back to me. It's not a huge sum of money, and I'm not inclined to spend a lot of time chasing it down, but, well, it would have been better had they been proactive about dealing with it. I got the same kind of attitude about the key cards, which are for some reason kind of temperamental. You need a key card to operate the elevator, because it's close to an unlocked exterior door. I noticed a number of people had trouble getting their key cards to work in the elevator, and eventually mine decided not to work at all. The front desk sent me back to the elevator and asked me to try again. I piggybacked on someone else's card, and finally on the next day the front desk gave me a new keycard. They'll eventually solve your problem, maybe, but they won't make it easy... The bottom line is that a superior King room at Hotel 140 is somewhat cheaper than many other recommended hotels in the area, and that gives you a clean, attractive room in a great Boston location. If it weren't for some problems with pretty basic customer service issues, I'd be happy to give it a \"very good\" rating as far as value for money is concerned.

I knew my friends already had guests staying over and I didn't want them to feel obligated to put me up, so my plan was to book somewhere prior to getting to the party. But it in the midst of all the hectic preparations of earlier that day, the reservation just did not happen. So there I sat, late in the evening, in the middle of the party, searching hotels on my iphone and with no success... unless I wanted to pay extortionately high rates at short notice. What's more, all the hotels I was considering were still quite a distance from the city center, where the party was - too far to walk and I would have paid an arm and a leg for a taxi that night. My friends eventually figured out what I was doing and when they learned that I was having no luck finding a place they jumped to recommend Hotel 140, right around the corner, and got on the phone to them for me, right away. They explained to me how great this place was, with excellent location and access, great spacious rooms and low pricing for the city center. Within minutes I was booked and free to enjoy the rest of my night at the party, knowing I could check in at any time of night, whenever I was ready. Also, because my friends often recommended this nearby hotel to friends visiting them in the city, the hotel offered me a stay in one of the available long-term suites. This room was simply amazing. I spend a lot of time traveling for work and am familiar with high end, business class hotels, but I was still taken aback by this place because, to me, it was just like walking into a new, fully furnished apartment and that was so much more welcoming than any hotel room. I had my own fully furnished kitchen area, complete with all utensiles! I really had a wonderful, relaxedd stay there that night and for a fraction of what the other hotels in the area would have charged. I had family in town from Ireland that week and so I met them for a day in the city the next day. In fact, I had them call around to my room that morning and made them breakfast in my room! As I repared to leave, it truly felt weird that I did not have to make my bed or tidy the bathroom - I was so comfortable that it felt like my own apartment all the while and I forgot all about maid service! The reason I am writing this is because, as I walked away from the building that morning I distinctly remember thinking, as I passed the various other high end hotels on my way to pick up my car (all the hotels that were NOT so central as Hotel 140), how good it felt to know I got the best deal - those of us who travel a lot KNOW that is not a feeling you every really get! So now I'm folloing up on a note I took in my iPhone at that time, to write this review. When I got to my car I realized I had left a t-shirt in the hotel and drove by to pick it up. The helpful manager there met me on the curb as I pulled up outside, saving my from having to park illegally - there's good service and then there's the 'delighters' like that! And as I pulled off I realized that no more than 100 yards away there was a tunnel that took me right onto the i-90 west and home - like I said in the title - 'Perfect'! Since my stay, my family liked the place so much as they visited me that they switched to there for the remainder of their visit that time and I've had friends stay there since.

There is a balled up network cable you can stretch to your bed to plug into your laptop though. Since this building used to be a YWCA (we assume judging by the signs outside) the room has a strange anomaly: unlike most hotels which have classy ambiguous paintings, the Hotel 140 rooms were decked out with large, real, poster photos of a family celebrating someone's birthday and another of girls exercising. You have to see it yourself to understand how UTTERLY these things do not belong in a hotel room, but to quote my girlfriend: \"What the ****?'

It was nice, very comfortable. The breakfast was coffee or tea and a muffin or croissant, which was ok for a complimentary breakfast. If we had of remained in a room similar to our first room I would have considered this hotel to be very overpriced, obviously since it was the hotels mistake we got the suite for the same price but beware as the booking and reception staff lacked professionalism.

We even checked to make sure all the windows were closed. Also, the curtains were shear and we had the sun in our face and couldn`t go back to sleep. We asked to change room which we did. The hotel staff was pretty clueless, no appologies just blank stare, as if they had never heard of this before. We did get a new room that had real curtains and was away from the noise. Overall, the rooms are poorly designed. It is ok for two days but I would get annoyed if I had to stay longer. There are no tables and no counter in the bathroom. You have to put everything on the floor. The shower head faces the door so if you start the water it goes on the floor. Even 2 star hotels in Europe don`t make that mistake. They told us breakfast was served until noon on weekends, there is even a sign in the front of the hotel but on Sunday, we went at 11:40 and it was closed. We knocked and a women gave us muffins but there was no coffee. It seemed like everything was a chore, even getting our voucher for the breakfast. Also note that there is a taxe from the state that they didn`t put on their website. So for a room of 110$/night, their is a 13$ a night charge.

The lift's doors open to a hallway that could have come out of an 80's school horror film, which in turn lead to a door that did not look like it should lead to a hotel room, but to a cleaning closet/office. The room was sparse to say the least.

I booked a 2 bed suite, but when I arrived, they informed me that none were available so I had to settle for a single bed. My cell phone didn't work in Boston that weekend, so I could call expedia.com about it. The room was extremely cramped, basically just fit the bed, the dresser/tv and a nightstand. The bathroom was tiny. These things didn't bother me that much since I'm from NYC, so am used to tight quarters. My main concern was that I saw and killed at least 3 bugs (not roaches...maybe bed bugs?) on the bed.

Our room was tiny and the bed was more like a single than a double, and was very uncomfortable.

This 'hotel' seemed more like a hostel to us and we were glad that we had only 2 nights booked to stay here. On the plus side it was clean and very convienient to the local attractions.

My room had a small carpet but otherwise linoleum flooring, wasn't very comfortable on the feet in the mornings. The bathroom was extremely small, the shower was barely big enough for one person and the showerhead was completely caked over in calcium deposits. The shower doors also leaked quite a bit which soaked the floor. The shower also has not where for you to place any toiletries so you have to place them all on the shower floor and bend over to use anything which is extremely uncomfortable.
