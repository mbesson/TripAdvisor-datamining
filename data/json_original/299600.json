We've enjoyed our stays there. We find its gardens green, lush and pleasant. The beach has nice shade and plenty of trees. We find the staff friendly, though a bit too reserved at times.We had some troubles on our visit this past week which perhaps not every guest would experience: our room AC was not cold enough, even after being checked by the maintenance people. The spring bed was sunken in the middle. Difficult to sleep comfortably. Time to change the mattresses!We were shocked also one day to find a diaper on the bottom of the pool. Yuck! The following day we found a very dirty diaper floating on sea just off the beach.The sea in front of the Mercure was absolutely filthy, with trash and an oil film floating on top. This is a problem all over Bali and not specific to the Mercure. Bali definitely needs to do something about the trash entering it's seas by the ton every day. It's spoiling the beaches and water sports experience.Generally the hotel is clean, except for some reason the area around the cow stall is covered with trash and pieces of old concrete. The beach sidewalk entrances to the hotel were also filled with a lot of trash.We ate twice at the evening buffet and it was fine, though the food at the Novotel Tanjung Benoa is definitely better.", "Date": "Nov 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR358227929", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "IndonesiaLongTerm"}, {"Content": "Quiet hotel with good beach location       The beach", "Date": "Nov 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR667806844", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "hol2be"}, {"Content": "Heaven on earth at the Mercure!

Location is great, right next to the beach and only a few minutes walk to Sanur's main street.Resort is ok, rooms look tired and need refurbishing. As per other reviews there is definitely something up with their sewage treatment and the smell can be foul at times.Staff were pleasant but forgetful. Every day we seemed to have to ask for towels or a bath mat that they had forgotten to restock. Speaking of towels - and its such a small thing to pick on but - in all my years of staying at hotels I have never seen such an awful selection of bath towels. Threadbare would be kind!We liked Sanur, would spend time there compared to the other side if given the choice again.The beach is not great for swimming but excellent for various water sports, especially kite surfingSo to sum up the Sanur Mercure is fine for a few days by the beach to get out on the water.

I requested airport pickup after giving my flight details, nobody showed up. Check in, and I am asked to wait for 1.5 hours so to allow guests to leave (I had already assigned room numbers). Looked at both rooms and the occupying guests after 2hr of my check in had no intentions of leaving. I complain (already having my credit card debited about USD 400) and nothing seems to happen. I am offered an alternative room (right besides the dining hall, location not quite as good as the original room they assigned me to) and another one that was not ready yet. I originally requested connecting rooms. Obviously, they were overbooked (or else cared little for an arriving guest who spend quite a bit of money just to get to Bali in the first place). In the meantime we went to the restaurant for a snack. My hamburguer arrives ice cold at the table. Fair meal. When I asked for the bill, the lady tells me to get it myself at the counter. I refuse and have it delivered to my table (is this a McDonald's or what?). While waiting, another waitress cleans up the table and scrapes the food of the other plates into mine, right in front of my face. I complain but little reaction. It appears that either customers dont complain for what appears a rather mediocre service or else they dont give a thing. This experience at the restaurant cost me USD 70 for what i consider a rather mediocre snack lunch in terms of quality. I cancelled both rooms, got my credit card credited, and then jumped into a taxi to start wandering through south Bali so to look for another hotel. What a great way to start your vacation.

My wife and I had a 6 night stay at the Mecure in the second week of June 2008. We were allocated a Deluxe room that is the closestr block of rooms to the reception area. Overall our impression was that this is a reasonable 3 star property that although refurbished in 2004 still looks and feels like a much older style of resort - taht it was and still is.On first look our deluxe room at $65 a night looked to be very good value. The bed was huge, the room quiet large and had all that was needed. A plus was the fridge was empty - not full of way over priced drink - for us to stock up from the local stores.The rseort buildings and gardens are well maintained for their age but it look out of date and old. Especially the recreation area. Similarly with the pools. They are smallish, well kept and clean but very old fashioned. Like many resorts the Mecure does nothing to stop people from claiming the best sun lounges eraly in the morning but do not actually use them until to later in the day. This is very annoying when the hotel was full. The Mecure is at the very southern and quiet end of the Sanur beach area. Its beach is quiet nice - at high tide - with plenty of sun longes and not over run by beach sellers. There are two local restuarants serving average but ok local fare and westyern dishes nearby. The first group of better restaurants are a short 400 m walk to the street out side the putri santrian or a fifteen minute walk (or a $1.50 taxi ride) to those around Massimo's in central Sanur.The positivesIt is quiet cheap. The resort has a nice beach and grounds are ok. The rooms are a good size. The staff were polite and helpful.The negativesLike many who have complained re strange sewer like smell from the shower this happened to us after our third night. It really does smell foul! The room was cleaned ok but the bathroom was not cleaned to the standard we would expect. The restaurant was very ordinary! The buffet is substandard and too expensive for what you get. The food was not warmed / heated satisfactorily!! It just looks old fashioned!Some tips re restaurants.Massimo's Italian Restaurant is a very very good value restuarant. If you are there when they have their Buffet try it out. At RP70 000 its a bargain!! Over 30 different items to select - the porchetta was superb. We really liked this restaurant, a fantastic staff, great host in Massimo who loves his restaurant and food. Can not recommend it more highly for very very tasty like mama cooked Italian food. Batu Jimbaran cafe (excellent and very popular food) , Caramels, Cat and Fiddle Pub, and the Mezzanine are also worth trying out. Donald's is also another very good value restaurant that we enjoyed.Overall we were disappointed in the Mecure Sanur, even though it is not expensive it needs to lift its game! The restaurant was very unimpressive! We would not stay there again - the Puri santrian looked to be a better option!", "Date": "Jun 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR280637855", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "dbfun"}, {"Content": "needs renovation I can't believe the hotel was renovated in 2004.

The set up with units build in Balinese style and thatched roofs in a garden setting full with flowering trees is very attractive. The Hyatt and Sanur Beach to name two competitors are basically very tired and ugly 70's buildings.

I spent 5 nights at the Mercure Resort Sanur.Check-In went smoothly, but the staff seemed kind of indifferent and unhappy (this first impression that I got was confirmed in the upcoming days).

The Deluxe-Room they gave me was located on the ground floor of a 2-storey Balinese-style bungalow. It looked good from the outside, but disappointed me from the inside. Although quite large, it looked dark and worn-out. There was only one rather small window to the outside, so even when the sun was shining, you had to keep the lights on most of the time. The bathroom looked shabby as well. According to the Accor-website the rooms where renovated in 2004, which I can hardly believe. Buffet-Breakfast was OK, but it lacked variety. I\u9e93ve seen much better in other hotels and for a hefty 14$ it was clearly overprized. As for the beach, I have read on other reviews, that it is the most beautiful in Sanur. While that may be true, it failed to impress me.Lots of trash and seagrass on the beach. There is a reef about 800m from the beach that serves as a shield, so there are almost no waves on the beach itself. The water is shallow and it felt more like swimming in a bathtub rather than an ocean. I\u9e93ve been to Lombok last year and the beaches there are worlds from this one... On the positive side, the grounds and the gardens througout the resort are well-kept. Luscious green everywhere, which really gives you that tropical feeling.
