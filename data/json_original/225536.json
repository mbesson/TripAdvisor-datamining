After booking via Priceline, I was expecting the worst after reading the reviews here. I ended up having a very good experience. The room I got, #1009, was large and comfortable. The beds were very comfortable, the views form the 10th floor were excellent, the room was almost spotless, and the location is hard to beat. A healthy 15 minute walk gets you to the Centro to the east, or to Chapultepec Park to the west along Reforma. The location was excellent.I wouldn't suggest the hotel breakfast buffet, which I found to be pricey, as I would suggest either the Starbucks next door at the FiestaAmerica, or the Vips restaurant a block north for breakfast. Service was very good, and the clerks knew English. I found them to be very helpful. The free wi-fi works fairly well, despite a few reliability lapses.", "Date": "Mar 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR764479487", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "tayser"}, {"Content": "Great view, indifferent employees, terrible food If you expect to be treated like a guest, don't bother to stay here. We spend 9 days (prepaid or we would have left the first night). The view over Paseo de la Reforma was great, but that's about all. We wanted this view to see the Independence Day Military Parade on Sept 16 or we would have demanded a change.When we arrived there was a coffee maker, but no coffee. When we called the desk, we were put on hold for almost ten minutes then told that the hotel is out of coffee this week (!) However, when we asked our maid the next morning, she had lots of coffee. We also discovered that the hair dryer (cemented to the lavatory) did not work and called reception again. My wife was told by a desk clerk well, just push the button if you want it to work. (which, of course, did NOT solve the problem - we do, after all, know how to push a button). When I called and threatened to leave, the desk finally (and ungraciously) sent up a portable hair dryer - but made no effort to fix the broken one. When we arrived, the toilet was also running very noisily. It took four days for someone to come fix it after we reported it. Once these annoyances were FINALLY seen to, the room was more or less OK. The only BRIGHT spot about the so-called amenities and the employees was Pilar, our maid, who went out of her way to make us comfortable, despite our being ignored and treated as though we were a bother by the rest of the staff.And for God's sake, find somewhere to eat besides the restaurant in the hotel. It is terribly overpriced for what you get. The breakfast buffet for $12.50 was pathetic: no toast, eggs ONLY if you request them (not on buffet or menu), cold canned sausages, watered down juices - need I say more?. And there were really only four items on the dinner menu. We tried only two of them before deciding to avoid the restaurant and eat somewhere - anywhere - else.The hotel was inexpensive and almost empty (now we see why!). But it just goes to prove the old saying you get what you pay for. Still, we WERE guests - paying guests at that - and we deserved to be treated as guests, not as bothersome nonentities.", "Date": "Sep 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR945789029", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "HoustonRamblers"}, {"Content": "a bit disappointed I had read all the reviews here before booking this hotel, and chose it for the location and the free internet access in the room. Duringmy stay, the internet access worked on the first day, but then did not work for the rest of my (four night) stay. This was a major disappointment for me, as I had a lot of work to do online, so that biased me a bit against the Mision Reforma.On the topic of internet, they have disconnected the hardwired Ethernet connections in the rooms, and the only available connection is wifi. Those rooms near the center (near the elevators) seem to get the best signal. If the internet is not working, I found free internet at a restaurant named VIP's nearby.The business center of the hotel has a couple of internet terminals, but beyond that, it is pretty useless. The location of the hotel is pretty good - it is on the Reforma right at the statue of Columbus (Colon). The walk to the nearest metro (Hidalgo station) is about 10 minutes - it is three (long) blocks. You can also take a colectivo bus along the Reforma for just a few pesos.For me, one of the highlights was the shower! The water pressure was terrific and the temperature great. I find that important after a long flight.The rooms are a bit dated, but large. My room had a strange 1970-era orange/blue combination. The rugs could use a good replacement, but I found the hotel to be clean and the accomodations very acceptable. Television with the normal Mexican channels plus CNN. Refrigerator (for the mini-bar, but accessible) and safe included.On my last night at the hotel, the air conditioning stopped working. I called the front desk, and was told that they would 'call maintenance' - this was the last I heard of it until I checked out the next morning and was told the entire hotel had no A/C that night. The windows do not open, so this was a bit unpleasant.Overall, I wanted to like this hotel - the staff were generally pleasant, the location was generall OK, and the surrounding area was acceptable. But I really just was never totally satisfied with the hotel. Next time, I will look elsewhere.", "Date": "Mar 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR811305966", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bobby_l"}, {"Content": "Good location We stayed here for a week and found the hotel to be just fine.It is centrally located and within walking distance of a lot of things you'd want to see in Mexico City. Despite being right on the Paseo it was not noisy, with double glazing and shutters on all windows. The room was large and clean and the shower worked well. There is a safe in each room which was big enough to take both laptops and all our paperwork! There is a business centre with free internet access on the ground floor. The 'restaurant' of the hotel is more of a cafe, but the food was good - freshly prepared to order - although of limited variety. There are several other places to eat within easy walking distance, or take a taxi to Maseryk in the Polenc district and you'll be spoilt for choice.Watch out for the hotel porters hailing you a taxi - they have some arrangement going with unmetered taxis and you will pay more for your journey than if you hail a metered taxi. There are two choices, white with red stripes or little green VW beetles. Always check that they have a meter before getting in - and make sure they turn it on. The flag fee should be about 6 or 7 pesos. Only one taxi driver tried to start our journey with 27 pesos on the clock before we'd moved an inch!", "Date": "Feb 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR335145393", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TravellerVera"}, {"Content": "Do not book there!!!

The location is convenient--if you're walking to historic downtown or to public transportation--but it is very hard to get to during rush hour (which lasts late into the evening in Mexico City) and impossible when protests clog the Reforma artery (which is about once or twice a week).The rooms are a bit shabby, but functional. Some rooms and floors are in better condition than others, but they usually have extra rooms available, and are happy to move you if something is wrong with your room. For example, the room I was given once did not have working air conditioning--a definite problem in downtowm Mexico City in the summer. But they changed my room as soon as another one opened up.There is a high-speed ethernet connection in the room which works most of the time. (It didn't work one visit out of 4.) There are no cables in the room, but the front desk will loan you one if you ask.It is one of the few hotels in the price category that have internet in the rooms, so it's a good choice for business travelers. There is a business center, but it is very small and not always staffed. But, hey, at least they have one.There is an in-room safe. You need to get the key/lock from the front desk. As someone else said--use it. My general rule of thumb when traveling internationally is that if there is a safe in the room, there's probably a reason.The staff at the hotel are extremely helpful and professional. Definitely one of the best staff's that I've run across in Mexico City. Only one time did I get a rude front desk attendant. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt that she was having a bad day because everyone else has been so great.The breakfast buffet is one of the better mid-class hotel breakfasts I have had. But except for breakfast, I would avoid the restaurant. The food is really sub par, and it is a shame to eat bad food in Mexico City when so many excellent restaurants abound. The only thing about the breakfast I didn't like was that when I brought a colleague to eat breakfast with me and we wanted to pay, the waiter wouldn't let me charge it to the room. He insisted that I pay in cash. It happened a second time the same way--and he asked me for a different amount. I'm pretty sure that he was pocketing the money and not reporting it. So that situation was a bit uncomfortable.But other than that, the hotel is quite fine for the price. Taxi drivers generally do not know it, so make sure you consult a map before you go (there's a little one on their website)so that you can explain where it is.", "Date": "Dec 8, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR617112463", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Nonprofit business traveler"}, {"Content": "Good but not great We stayed in this hotel while vacationing in Mexico. It is located near the Zona Rosa and Chapultepec, which in my opinion is the best and safest place to stay for tourists to stay in Mexico City.
