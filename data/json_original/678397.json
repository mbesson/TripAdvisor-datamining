I'm not sure if the more expensive rooms are nicer, but my room was quite basic with a double bed, very worn comforter, ceiling fan, and incredibly decrepit bathroom. The bathroom, especially the toilet, was old and stained. The inn itself is gorgeous, a lot of plants and flowers, beautiful little pool, and nice area for breakfast. Breakfast itself (included in the price of the room, and it was decent: coffee/tea, fruit plate, and choice of toast or banana pancake. The staff, as another TA reviewer noted, was pushy at times. I was approached numerous times to keep tabs on where I was going (do you need transport? tours?) and asked if I wanted a massage at the spa. After two days, I moved a few doors down to Ubud Bungalows, which at $5 more was complete luxury when compared to Ubud Inn. And with clean/modern bathrooms!", "Date": "Aug 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR276931441", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bellagreen"}, {"Content": "great garden, mediocre room Ubud Inn has a realy nice and large garden. The room has a comfortable balcony on which you can relax and enjoy the greenery and flowers. Inside our room was large enough, but with little furniture and a simple small bathroom. It was noisy, we could clearly hear the people in the other rooms talking and heard their television. The staff was friendly, but I noticed a couple of staff (without the usual hotel uniform) who were maybe a little too cosy or informal.", "Date": "Nov 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR912344339", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Gerda"}, {"Content": "Not very impressed. Stayed here for a few nights. The room was okay, but the bathroom was terrible. It was supposed to have hot water. This consisted of an electric shower unit positioned 10 cm above a bathtub, with nothing to hold the shower head. Therefore, the thing was not good for a bath or shower. The hot water did not work. Cold water at extremely low pressure. When they turned the gas on, there was a leak. This was not fixed during my stay, and they did not offer a discount when I checked out.Most of the hotel staff were friendly, but some were rather pushy trying to organise tours and taxis for you everyday. You don't really need this from hotel staff, especially when you are asked this question every thirty seconds walking around Ubud.Gardens were nice.", "Date": "Oct 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR516892750", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "AK1974"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d678397-r22884522-Ubud_Inn-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "678397", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
