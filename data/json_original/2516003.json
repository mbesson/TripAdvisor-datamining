I don't need to feel like I'm nickel and dimed on top of that. I get it, but for some reason it feels slight. Great location, rooms are nice. Probably still worth it.

If the underlying philosophy of this hotel is to create a hotel room that does not look like a hotel room, then the proprietors have succeeded. Alas, many conventional design features in hotel rooms serve a functional purpose. For example, it is fine to have lights that do not look like lights, but not if they only illuminate a patch or two of the rug, and it is fine to have chairs and sofas that do not look like chairs and sofas, but not if they are so uncomfortable that no human being would want to sit upon them. And an illuminated clock, goodness, how jejune, let's get rid of it, but it sure would have been useful in the middle of the night. And a master light switch near the bed, not very slick, let's not have one, etc... Other annoyances: The lobby was so dark that when I came in from the California sunshine I had to stand for a minute for my eyes to adjust. The lobby/reception staff wasn't that attentive and, when attentive, creepily obsequious. The \"fun\" little sayings riffing off SLS. (For example, in business center, Surf Lovely Sites.) These were posted everwhere. I dubbed them Stupid Little Sayings and came up with some of my own, including the title to this review: Subpar Lighting Systems, So Laughably Smug, Staff Largely Smarmy, and so on. Fortunately I am an early riser, so the loud conversations taking place outside my door from 430AM-530AM didn't bother me that much. It was not all bad, of course. There was a certain feeling of luxury. The bed was quite comfortable. They had dishes of these tasty mini-apples near the elevator. The pool and gym looked nice, though I didn't have a chance to use them.

I stayed here over the period of 25-27 April, in the Terrace Suite. Upon arrival at the SLS, which is fantastically located I might add, the doorman greeted me warmly, the front-desk staff were very cheerful, and offered their considerations for where to eat, and what to do during my stay. The hotel is beautifully decorated, modern-chic is the look I would describe it as. It was a tad dark, but I guess that's all the rage now, and it truly was designed right down the finest detail! The room was fantastic - really great! Great minibar, superbly stocked, superb beds and linens, and the room amenities were all perfectly placed. The bathroom products are of the Spa, \"Ciel\" and are delectible, I wish I had purchased some when I was there! The room is very large, with a centrally located bed, quiet and there was a quiet terrace, which unfortunately I could not use as it was raining during my stay. The Spa, \"Ciel\" was also fantastic! The staff were so attentive, very kind and honest. I had a deep tissue massage which was superlatively relaxing, and used the steam room facilities, all of which were impeccably clean and well appointed. The decor in the Spa was very modern, and definitely to my taste. I also tried out the must-go-to restaurant, \"The Bazaar, which was WOW! The gastronomic experience blew my mind, and along with the reasonable prices it was fantastic! You must try the Dry-Ice Caipirinhas, as well as the olives, Philly cheese steak sandwiches! They are really fantastic! What makes this hotel so great is, well everything! The staff are so attentive, I was definitely impressed! The decor is great, the rooms spacious, the spa relaxing, the restaurant hip and delectable.

Big shout out to Neil and Dan out front, these guys rock! My entire group truly enjoyed having the complimentary JetVan to take us around. I have tried other properties in the area but the SLS is certainly my new home when in Beverly Hills. The restaurants are great and I enjoy the pool deck.

The concierge was very helpful and friendly but the front desk should be able to provide a very small but important amenity and not suggest I go to CVS down the street. The pool was small but had a cool design. I would have liked it more if the best sun facing chairs wouldn't have been \"reserved\" and sitting empty the whole time I was up there.

I also liked the fact that the hotel was close to the Beverly Center, Rodeo Drive, and Beverly Hills. We arrived around 4pm and found our room to not be ready. The gentleman at the front desk was very apologetic and offered us a $100 hotel credit to use however. We waited in the gorgeous lobby for a bit, walked around to look at the design, and decided to enjoy ourselves with the SPG elite snacks until the room was ready. We received a call that our room was ready about 45 minutes later. I had to get back to my conference by 8pm, so we decided to have dinner at the hotel and use our credit. Our meal by Chef Jose Andres was wonderful. When we got up to our room, we were really excited about how beautiful and nicely layed out it was. We had a great patio. The bathrooms are unbelievable. The beds were extremely comfy. The public spaces throughout the hotel were great. The Starck design was amazing. Loved the photos of people in the elevator. Also, loved the deer heads above fire places. The pool tables on each floor and other cool art (machine gun lamps) are a nice touch. I enjoyed getting in the pool before the crowd arrived the next morning and having some quiet time to read and pray. We had breakfast on the pool terrace and greatly enjoyed the food. Eventually, it was a bit crowded out there as an NBA player was doing a photo shoot in one of the pools. I tried to speak to him as he was standing next to our breakfast table with his entourage. He just ignored me and used some profanity while talking to his crew. He left and I commented about how rude he was. After breakfast, we went back to our room. As I was placing my key into my room, he walked out of his room next to mine with his duffel bag in hand and said, \"what's up man?\" I assume he was on his way to promote Meta World Peace.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cA nice place to stay, but...\u201d", "Author": "Crusader1427", "ReviewID": "UR128218847", "Content": "We stayed three days, enjoying the quality of the rooms, hotel location, staff friendliness and good (if very expensive) meals but we experienced difficulties behind the scenes which caused hiccups.

But in the end, how cool your hotel looks doesn't matter to me if the rooms aren't comfortable and laid out well. The SLS beds and furniture are too short. Why can't they be normal size? Platform beds might look cool, but they're never, ever as comfortable as regular beds, and this one was no exception. The desk is ridiculous...not sure who would ever use that, and it takes up valuable real estate. They didn't even provide a luggage rack in the room so my suitcase had to be on the ground. Even the Best Western provides luggage stands. When you open the closet it smelled musty and old..or something...I can't describe the smell but it was awful. I never used the closet because of that - also because they have these stupid little leather loops to open the doors with. Hey guys, they've invented these things called HANDLES that work great!! They don't provide any coffee or tea maker in the room (again, even 2-star hotels have that). The bathroom has no space to put your goods. The huge kitchen-size sink takes up almost the whole counter, and you can't put your personal items on the tiny shelves in there. Shower pressure is terrible...a sad little dribble. They put the shampoo, conditioner, body wash in these huge-size bottles which is a little gross because you know someone's grabbed them before you, also the quality of the product was not great. Would have liked a bar of soap. Some housekeeping items: my bed was shortsheeted at the bottom (picture attached) - gross and unsanitary because you know they don't wash mattress pads every time. I did call housekeeping and at least they fixed it the following night. Also the drain was so clogged in the shower it filled with two inches of water almost immediately.

It's now morphed into the SLS - who knows that those letters stand for - and the lighting, clubby lobby and dark halls are similar to the Mondrian and the re-imagined Roosevelt Hotel ... two other hotels inhabited by 20-something, agressive scenesters. Yes, everything is overpriced but I found my room to be pretty interesting in its design and furnishings... from a giant wall with a two-way mirror that hides the large, flat screen TV, to highly polished stainless steel sliding doors for the cool bathroom with a huge shower and sink. Trouble is, the bathroom was so dark that I couldn't see to shave so when I went out into the light, I noticed I looked like I was some old man who missed a bunch of spots... Maybe the dark lighting is why the maids obviously missed DUST EVERYWHERE! The worst example was the mini-bar basket that included a $25 SLS baseball cap - it was black and a ton of dust bunnies - not just a little, but a lot! Then I noticed dust all over the night stands and other surfaces. Room service was prompt and good. I special-ordered a smoke-salmon omelette and it was good - as was the homemade pork sausage. The staff was uniformly friendly - a surprise for such a pretentious looking place. From the hotel operator to the front desk and concierge staff and the room service order taker - they were all as cheerful as the Four Seasons people... but the big difference - the Four Seasons would never have such dusty/dark rooms - and they always have 3 or 4 concierges working instead of just one. For my money, I'd choose the Four Seasons any day. But then again, I'm 40-something instead of 20-something. ONE NOTE: even if you are a young hipster, you'll hate a room that looks out on a construction project - that was actually filled with workers and noisey machinery on a Saturday morning.

The bathroom was of a good size but did not have a bath tub. I did not miss it but would expect a room in the $500 category to have one. The darkness in the bathroom is a design fad but not practical. The gym is state of the art. Although it gets busy the equipment is one of the best I have seen in a hotel. The food in the restaurant was excellent and the staff attentive. The breakfast buffet was disappointing. The quality of the food and the staff were great but the choice was far too limited for my taste.

The SLS Hotel at Beverly Hills was the best hotel experience I've ever had. From the moment I pulled up to the front drive I was greeted and immediately directed to reception. The guys driving my car were very professional every time I needed it. In addition because I travel so much sometimes I get a bad feeling with some of the Valets...I didn't get that this time. In particular I believe his name was Lamar but he was most helpful. When my daughter and I arrived at Reception we were greeted by Sean who treated us like we were the only people in the hotel. He told us if we needed anything to let him know personally and gave me his business card. A lot of people say this but with him I was happy to know it was genuine. Whenever I needed something he took care of it for me. I had a small issue with my room and there was Sean again taking care of us. The hotel absolutely screams luxury but you wouldn't compare it to a St Regis or 4 Seasons. It's luxury service without the stuffy atmosphere. I was reminded at registration that I just had to try out the fine food at the Bazaar. I stopped by the concierge station and was greeted by Fredo who promptly made us a reservation. He was sincere, honest and had a great sense of humor even though I could see he was incredibly busy. The Bazaar was just something out of a fairy tail. My daughter and I ate enough to make a large dent in their inventory and my purse lol. The only complaints I have about my incredible experience was that it took about 45 minutes for us to receive our luggage. I understand the hotel is busy but there probably should be more people on staff to handle the business. The last thing I'll say is that I learned all of their rooms are spacious but try and get a suite or even a terrace room.

I tried phoning downstairs to no avail. Got dressed and ran out only to be told in the hall to go back to bed, false alarm. Now these things happen, they are after all for everyone's safety, however when I called the lobby to ask what the cause was, I was told it was unknown. I asked if this has happened recently but the answer was \"we are not allowed to disclose.\" Understood, so I asked to speak to the manager. Hold, hold, hold. Gave up. Called again a few minutes later as at this point the headache prevented me from sleeping. I was told manager would be right with me which really meant hold so long that I again thought of hanging up; this time i didn't. I expressed my concern for safety and asked what had really occured only to be vaguely told it was a 'false alarm,' I asked when was the last time this happened and the manager replied he did not know. When I pressed, I was then told 'well I have only been here a short while so that is why I don't know.\" I asked the manager who would know, he replied the operations manager; I asked him to please find out and get back to me as he seemed rather uncooperative regarding what I considered to be a safety concern, he replied he would. He never did. No one did. I called the fire department to ask about safety issues at the hotel. First thing I learned was that this hotel, in spite of the name and all its marketing, is not in Beverly Hills but in Los Angeles, so I was redirected to the Los Angeles fire department. The local inspector told me that in fact there had been 'quite a few incidents' in this hotel but they were mostly attributed to incorrectly placed sensors in the kitchen, the inspector was under the impression the hotel had resolved this but he would follow up. Since management never gave me a response i asked a member of the cleaning crew, he told me that this happens often and always at the worst time, he said, 'it recently happened at 3 a.m.\" I am shocked that management completely ignored my request for info and never replied. It is clear that the \"I don't know answer\" really means \"I don't want to answer\" as in the truth is not pretty. I will be cutting my stay short here. While most fault this hotel on lighting, which really is terrible, or staff attitude, which has room for serious improvement; or the gym, which is tired and dated and has no shower, steam or locker facilities unless you pay to use the spa, my main concern is one of safety and given the lack of reply I caution others.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California, United States", "Title": "\u201cA great place to be...\u201d", "Author": "Tri H", "ReviewID": "UR125713565", "Content": "Had a friday night available and took the wife for a quick staycation at SLS.

I\u2019m a platinum SPG and was upgraded to a 2nd floor room with a balcony (I believe balconies are only available on the second floor rooms) and my room was comfortable and interesting. The lighting in the room is fabulous for ambiance with so many lights to choose from and all with dimmer functionality (although never bright), but try getting ready and evaluating how you look in smoked glass and low light. The furniture is awesome and I loved the bed positioned in the middle of the room with the desk behind it, but how do you plug in your iPad or phone so that you can use it bed? I had to drape the cord over the back of the bed into the side of the desk and then it was too short to keep my iPad charged in bed. The desk chair is comfortable if you don\u2019t have ambition to move around or lean back \u2013 it doesn\u2019t move without picking it up and carrying the chair to its new position. The closet doors are attractive, but the closet lacks a luggage rack to set your suitcase on within the closet and be aware when you open the liquor cabinet next to the closet \u2013 the hinged door will slam down on you without warning. The ironing board has a lovely birdcage image on its cover, however try ironing a shirt on it \u2013 it\u2019s the dorm-sized version you never used in college and works even worse in this room because the only place to set it on is the desk and then the board slides all over. Would it have been too much to provide a standard ironing board? With all of this complaining you\u2019d think I have issues with the bathroom as others have pointed out. I don\u2019t. I actually liked the stone and mirrors in the bathroom and thought the shower was very nice. I especially appreciated all of the shelves near the sink to set toiletries. As for the pool, I like when designers take risks, but the Alice in Wonderland meets urban garage sale didn\u2019t so much as create an oasis as it made me feel like I was intruding on an outdoor mirror and frame sale. I still don\u2019t know what the purpose was for the pool with 6\u201d of water that monopolized half the deck space. I found the pool service to be exceptional (I believe her name was Stephani) but the food was bland and the pool area overall is quite congested and unattractive. The gym was great, but the ceiling is pretty low in the weight machine area and like the rest of the property felt a little cavernous. I\u2019m not, not recommending this hotel \u2013 really the entire staff was wonderful from Valet to Concierge to front desk to pool and I really did enjoy the frivolity of the aesthetics. I even liked lounging in the room and sitting out on my patio. I just don\u2019t think I\u2019d choose it again when there are other options in Beverly Hills/Century City/WeHo that could provide a little more functionality in the room and comfort at the pool with or without the whimsy.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague", "Title": "\u201cElegant AND comfortable\u201d", "Author": "melinda311", "ReviewID": "UR124894149", "Content": "What a beautiful hotel! i didn't actually stay in the hotel (but the rooms are fantastic and I will absolutely put visiting clients into this hotel).

The staff was happy to get the box and pack up some awesome Greek yogurt for my kids (yes, I had kids there...they loved it). At the front desk, Aaron was just so sweet and friendly and helpful and Bobby the bellman was super at showing us around for our first time in the hotel. The best example of employee awesomeness had to be Gerald...who, when I asked for a trash bin for our almost finished Frappuccinos, smiled and warmly took them from me, gross napkins and all, took them from me. He could not have been nicer about it and I was not expecting THAT kind of service. The apples in the lobby were also a great touch and we loved them!

I have asked 5star hotel all over the world to clear my mini bar and never was I charged for it! 5-finally worse of all was the check out process.

I made the mistake on a recent visit to Los Angeles of staying at the SLS Hotel for about 4 nights. My expectation in a rated luxury hotel is that my room will be safe for me personally and that any belongings I have in the room will be safe. Not so at the SLS. We had purchased some clothing at Barney's and left it in the shopping bag in the room. Upon check out we noticed that the bag had vanished. That's when the so called Luxury Hotel showed it's true colours. I immediately called security about the missing bag and a security person came to the room and wrote a report. As we were in the process of checking out I was told I would hear back from the security officer within a few hours. Upon check out I asked for the General Manager as I wanted to make sure he knew of the incident. As he was not available I made sure the front desk was aware of the situation and asked that a message be left for him to call me. About 4 hours later after not receiving a call back as promised from the security person I called the hotel only to find he was not available but would return my call. This back and forth went on for about 6 weeks with no results of their investigation. I had also talked to Sarah the General Manager's assistant a number of times and asked her to have the General Manager call me but to no avail. I never recieved a call from the General Manager. Eventually after leaving several messages for their lead investigations person he did call and tell me that the results of their investigation had turned up nothing and of course they would not be reimbursing me anything as it was my word against their word. There were suggestions made by this individual that there were perhaps other ways they could look after me and he would get back to me on that but I never heard anything further. In all my years of travelling I have never had a worse experience than this hotel delivered to me. It's been 3 months since the loss occurred and all I have is further long distance telephone bills trying to get answers from these totally incompetent people.

When booking I noted the price range for the room was $350-$450 depending on night we were staying. There is parking on the streets in the neighborhoods by the SLS you just need to be very careful and read the street signs because you will get a ticket. The most we had to walk was 3-4 blocks. I am fairly cheap and didn't want to pay the $30+ for valet parking. If you don't mind walking it wasn't hard for us to find a decent spot. When we arrived the entrance was a little confusing because they have the Baazar entrance and then the hotel entrance on the side. It took us a moment to get it. There wasn't any line at check in and the front desk was very friendly and helpful. He did say he was upgrading our room to one with a terrace (outdoor patio). I'm not sure how much of an upgrade this is from a standard room, but it was nice to have since the weather was beautiful at the time. There wasn't a view from the patio, but it was comfortable. My only complaint about it was there wasn't any light. We wanted to sit out there and have some dessert one night. I ended up moving one of the lamps so we could see. The 4 stars is because this is a very trendy hotel and I wouldn't pay $400/night to stay here. I have been to many resorts in Hawaii, Mexico etc that are nicer for less money. Rooms - The rooms were very clean and housekeeping did an impeccable job. One night they even gave us a turndown service with some chocolates. My only complaint about the room was the layout. I hit my shin on the corner of the bed at least 3 times. I have the bruise to prove it. This may be because I am clumsy since Mr. C didn't do it once, but I don't think there was enough room between the table and the bed. I always had to remember to be extra careful. We didn't get a room with a bathtub, which I would have loved to relax in. Next time I will remember to ask how to get one of these rooms. I loved the products and wanted to take them home with me, but they come in large containers that are used again. I have seen a lot of people had problems with the lighting, but it didn't bother me. I was able to put my makeup on just fine and was able to see. One of my favorite parts of the room was the extra blanket on the bed. It was super comfy and I never let Mr. C use it. Service - Everywhere we turned the service was excellent. One day we had to have the plumber come up (don't ask why). He was there in less than 5 minutes and fixed the problem right away. We were having technical difficulties hooking our laptop up to the TV and they sent an engineer up right away. Although he wasn't able to figure out the problem right after he left I was able to get it to work. One morning when I was leaving the front desk called me by name and told me to have a good day. He totally caught me off guard, but it was a nice touch that he knew who we were. When leaving on our last day I'm not sure if they saw us coming but we were greeted at the elevator and asked if we needed help with our bags. At checkout I noticed we had been charged for some minbar items that we never used. The front desk didn't ask questions and credited my account for them. The location isn't the perfect Beverly Hills location, but their are plenty of restaurants near by and you are within a short drive to many things ( Hollywood, Sunset, Rodeo etc). I enjoy the happy hour at Gyu-Kaku. Although we didn't eat at Bazaar this time around I have been there before and the food is some of the best I have ever had. The prices are steep but worth every penny. On the weekends the bar is pretty happening and is the trendy LA scene if that is what you are looking for.

I point this out because my wife and I are people that love different hotel experiences and rarely stay at the same hotel. We've stayed at the Beverly Hills Hotel, L'Hermitage, Four Seasons but after that first stay at the SLS, we couldn't wait to go back. So much so that I had won a weekend stay at another luxury hotel and I choose to PAY to stay at the SLS again. From the moment you arrive,you feel like a movie star. The hotel staff is one of the best I encountered. Whether it was the valet or the housekeeping staff, everyone treats you like you are their primary concern. It is truly a level of service that you read about in travel magazines but rarely get to experience. The restaurants and room service are all run by Jose Andres, an innovative chef who's The Bazaar at the hotel is one of the hottest tables in LA. All of our meals at the hotels were unbelievable and again the staff were some of the most accommodating and courteous we've encountered. Be sure to have breakfast at Tres and have the French toast(like s bread pudding). At night, have a drink at the bar next to The Bazaar and order the Jose Andres Gin and Tonic or a Margarita with salt air foam. Keep your eyes peeled for celebrities as they flock here. After you check in, you'll enter an elevator with \"other guests\" muraled on the walls upon exiting your floor, you'll see a pool table with the words \"Satan Loves Sinners\" stitched on the side. There's an electronic painting of a victorian era man than slowly changes into a monkey. Your room is as funky as the rest of the hotel. Amazing beds, modern decor, and a tv hidden within a mirror. The roof top bar looks like something out of a movie set with a beautiful and attentive staff to match. The gym and spa leave nothing to be desired. You literally forget you are in one of the most congested parts of Los Angeles within the walls of the SLS. They also offer a chauffeured car for short trips. You can't help but feel like one of the Hollywood elite when you stay here. And you should because all the SLS staff treats you like one! Take my word and stay here on your next trip to Los Angeles. My hat is off to the General Manager of the hotel who not only directs this fine staff but heard about a special event we were celebrating and made our stay extra special. Keep up the amazing work!

It's well located, it's Starwood (as I try and stay in Starwood hotels wherever possible), trendy, and has some great restaurants both in the local vicinity and attached to the hotel, including Mortons, which is decent, and The Bazaar by Jose Andres which is supposed to be stunning but I'm yet to try. The rooms are very well designed, the gym's 24 hour, the room service menu is solid... so why I am complaining? Firstly, the rooms are very, very, very dark - the extent that seeing the contents of your suitcase is difficult, even with all the lights on maximum, and good luck getting ready, because even the bathroom's don't contain any bright lights at all. Which I understand is cool and relaxing and trendy etc, but a total nightmare if you want to style your hair - or for females - apply makeup. I was constantly seeing myself in the hall mirrors upon leaving my room and being horrified. But I guess my issue is with the service - it never seemed to be quite up to par for a hotel of this standard. Check in was downright unfriendly. I don't expect to have the red-carpet rolled out (although as a Platinum SPG member, it often is), but some basic politeness would sure be nice. As part of the benefits of SPG Platinum, you receive guaranteed upgrades to the best rooms available - and whilst that doesn't always happen, you're generally told \"Sorry Sir, we're actually fully booked, so although you're a Platinum member we won't be able to improve your room, but will being whatever we can to make your stay great\". I wasn't told anything, but when I asked if any better rooms were available, I was simply told \"No\". Long story but the short answer is, don't come here expecting any superior treatment for spending a huge amount of money with Starwood each year - you won't get it. As it happens, I had booked a suite anyway so the lack of a huge upgrade wasn't a huge issue, but as a top-level member of the hotel chain's loyalty scheme staying in a $400 suite booked with cash (not SPG points or anything), I would have expected a slightly better attitude. That sort of experience seemed to be a running theme throughout my four nights. For every helpful, ready-to-serve individual you'd encounter, they'd be another who let the whole place down. I called down at 11pm to try and arrange a laundry collection and was flatly told \"The laundry opens at 9am Sir\". \"But can't you come and get my laundry now, for the morning?\" I asked, as tends to be the procedure in any decent hotel, and was told again \"Sir, the laundry opens at 9am\". After calling back, frankly bewildered and asking to speak to a supervisor, I was told \"Oh, I didn't understand what you meant. I'll send a bell-hop now\". Er, yeah. I could go on, but I guess you get the drift. The concierge who seemed utterly unconcerned that I waited 15 minutes for a taxi when I was clearly bugged at running late for dinner. The fact that my mini-bar wasn't restocked once during a four day stay. The room-service chicken with mashed potato that came without mashed potato. It goes on. In short, it's good. It could be a lot better. Next time in LA, I'll be back staying at The London, which is a very similar sort of hotel and only about a mile away, but where they *do* get the service right.

I have to be a fan of Sam now because he hired two visionaries to create an awesome experience: Phillipe Starck and Jose Andres. The design is fantastic. Interesting, comfortable, and whimsical. Very luxurious and a little pretentious (it's LA after all). Check in was easy and front desk was friendly and efficient. The room is really trippy. Bed is in the middle of the room, bathroom is all slate and tinted mirrored glass.Little trinkets all over the room (for you to purchase, of course). The room was EXTREMELY clean, which I was a bit surprised about due to the complexity of the room and the amount mirrored surfaces. My only criticism is that the bed could be a bit more comfortable. By no stretch of the imagination would I say it is uncomfortable, but considering how great the room was it was a little disappointing. Also the chaise lounge wasn't very comfortable. The lobby bar was well decorated, served terrific drinks, and had a good crowd. The pool area was a bit cluttered. They need to do a better job here due to the competition of Hollywood rooftop pools. I didn't eat in the restaurant this time around, but have in the past and it is delicious and fun. I did order room service however, which was delicious and prompt. I ordered it through the SLS mobile app which they advertise all over the place. This was a fun feature that I'm sure will catch on at other luxury properties.

From a location standpoint, you can't go wrong. For those that have been to LA, you know how spread out it is, and if there were a 'central' location to a lot, this would be it. The hotel itself was magnificient. It was incredibly popular and packed with people, but still maintained a somewhat cozy feel. My room was incredibly appointed, with the highlight being the dark-mirrored wall with the TV directly in the center of it. The bathroom had a standing shower only and plenty of modern amenities. I appreciate that they had bottles of soap, shampoo, etc. that were large enough that you only used what you needed and that the hotel wasn't going to throw away an entire bottle of liquid just because I used a little bit. The fitness room was the best in any hotel I've stayed in. Two rooms big, one side maintained cardio equipment while the other had the circuit resistance machines.

I am 6'2, which is not enormous, and my feet were hanging off of them. Also didn't have an iPod player... really? 3. Bathroom. The worst part. They have a bunch of toiletries in the bathroom which I thought was a nice touch until I realized you had to PAY for them. How tacky. Second, the bathtub/shower combo is just bizarre- the shower head is in the ceiling and water splashes all over the floor outside the bathtub. Finally, they have that horrible hotel trend where the bathroom doors slide open to the room - as if anyone wants to look in or out the bathroom from the rest of the room. 4.

Also Danny who did the room orientation and made us feel right at home. It was a lifetime experience to stay in the heart of Beverly HIlls and experience the star treatment but not my cup of tea.

I'd have to say that this is one of the best hotels I've stayed at in the Starwood chain, to include numerous Ws and Westins, in various countries. Perhaps it's the relative newness of this property that lends itself to being so well-maintained. Regardless, the hotel rooms and public areas are very chic and ooze an upscale feeling, and the service was generally on par with, or above what I expect at the rates paid, and I was very happy. The exterior of the hotel is very nondescript, but not in a bland way. It's understated, which is a nice touch. Inside the valet area, though, is a completely different story; it looks exactly what I've pictured the porte-cochere of a Beverly Hills hotel to look like - lots of beautiful furniture and art, all very tastefully situated. It was what I imagine a Beverly Hills home to be like. All the valets, bellmen, and other hotel staff were very smartly dressed in shirts and ties, or business dresses. Everything at this hotel is very dark, with lots of dark tones, to include the uniforms. We were greeted by name everywhere we went, and services were offered promptly, courteously, and without attitude, which is something I unfortunately *did* expect. It was a very pleasant arrival experience. Check in was not as perfect as the valet/bell service. It wasn't bad by any means, though. We arrived at about 1:45 pm, a little before the general check-in time of 3 pm. I know that's not unusual, but that I shouldn't expect a room to be ready. What irked me a bit, though, was that several other parties decided to check-in early as well, which overwhelmed the front desk staff a bit - and only 2 of 3 check-in terminals were being used while several bellmen/concierge staff stood around. I would have appreciated if someone on staff would have noticed the line forming at the front desk, and called over another person to assure that all check-in stations were manned. This did not happen. One clerk was a trainee, but she was doing her best with what appeared to be a reservation with a bit of a hiccup. The other clerk was dealing with what I thought to be an overly-demanding-but-not-deserving guest who swore that she found a rate online for a particular suite, but nothing in SLS system said that was even remotely true. Both clerks handled the situations with grace and smiles. Kudos to them for that. As I said, it wasn't a bad experience at all, but I disliked having to wait 15 minutes to check-in when there was another station available. It just seemed like some disconnect in personnel management. However, it should be noted that the trainee, who eventually helped my partner and I, was very apologetic about the wait and overall incredibly friendly and helpful. The room was amazing. We only had the lowest grade of room available, but it was great. The decor was very posh, and done with impeccable taste. It's a blend of modern and maybe...art nouveau? Either way, the set up of the room itself, to the furniture used, to the bathroom were just remarkable. The pictures provided on this site will do a better job of showing the details of the room, but in my examination of the room itself, all the furniture was very, very well-kept and incredibly clean. The rooms contain a LOT of mirrored surfaced, to include, walls, tables, and the bed. And you can imagine what a nightmare that must be. Their housekeeping staff definitely has their work cut out for them, but appear to be doing a superb job. I have only one complaint about the room: All the mirrored walls have a smoke tint to them, making the rooms very dark, even with all the lights on. This is especially troublesome in the bathroom where sufficient light is necessary when getting ready to go out. Even though the bathroom mirror over the sink wasn't tinted, the other surfaces are, and they just seem to absorb all the light. The shower and the bounty of bathroom amenities almost make up for the dimness, though. The shower products come in large bottles, so you never have to worry about running out or opening tiny little vials of shampoo or conditioner with already-soapy/slippery hands. We used the valet and requested turn-down service. Every time we called the front desk or the valet, they were extremely gracious and accommodating. My partner and I aren't terribly needy, but felt as though any desire we would have expressed, would have been met with every effort to see it met. The location... It's just down the street from the Beverly Center and a short drive or a decent-ish walk to West Hollywood. However, the surrounding areas are light commercial and not the kind of area I'd necessarily think of for this kind of hotel, especially given the oasis you experience once inside the property. Perhaps this hotel, itself, is an effort to gentrify the area. Either way, though, the drive from the airport to the hotel left my partner and I wondering if this was the best choice. Again, I'd definitely return and the location *is* convenient, just don't be dissuaded by the surrounding neighborhood. I regret that we were only able to stay one night, as I would have loved to use the pool or the spa, and just experience a day or two more of the hotel. It's a great place and is definitely on my list of places to look at the next time I'm in LA.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria", "Title": "\u201cVery trendy and modern - more for the young and try hards\u201d", "Author": "sunloverVictoria", "ReviewID": "UR117776078", "Content": "Checked in for 5 nights with a friend.

The breakfast buffet was very limited but the food was excellent. Their homemade Greek vanilla yogurt with berries was fantastic and the wait staff was down-to-earth, very friendly and eager to please. Our family is still talking about this yogurt. Seriously.

The Hotel is very trendy, a \"see and be seen\" scene. The restaurant / bar \"Bazaar\" located at the hotel seems to attract a very trendy crowd, and offers great food as well! We ate there one night, and I found it very interesting. We booked a corner suite with a balcony (only 3 available), as the hotel is non-smoking, and we wanted to smoke in the balcony. The room was quite large, with a lot of empty space (which I understand is a \"design\" issue, but personally I would have liked a couch in the vast area between the bed and the TV). Nice amenities, very nice design, very trendy and hip. Free wi-fi was in the rate. The common areas are also very nice, especially the lobby area. The \"guests only\" pool area on the 6th floor is also nice, but the pool is quite small. The location is quite good as well, as it's walking distance from the Beverly Center mall, and a good epicenter from which to start a drive around the city. Issues: * Nice to have a Mac in the room, but we could not get it to connect to the Internet, so it was pretty useless. * Upon arrival my girlfriend opened a candy bar and a bottle of water. Later, I realized that they charge $6 for the candy bar and $10 for a bottle of Evian. That's too much. No reason for that. * The door to the shower slams closed every time, and that caused all the items on the shelve inside to fall on the floor every time. * There is a showerhead on the wall in the shower that is basically immovable, and no other options. That means that when you turn the shower on, you will immediately get splashed with cold water. No matter what you do, you cannot avoid this! * $36 / day for valet parking is too high for guests. * The sliding door to the balcony was faulty, and you had to use all your strength to open and close it.

As for the hotel itself, the design is unique, modern, very cool and inviting; as for the service --- not so much. In this day and age where customer service is paramount the SLS completely failed in my book for a few reasons: 1. I had a confirmed upgrade through American Express and when I arrived the person checking me in told me that I had been upgraded but when I got to my room, I realized this was the room I paid for. When the hotel admitted it was wrong, they told us we could move rooms (we were already unpacked) or they would refund us the difference. We chose the refund, but when we checked out they had no recollection of that conversation and it was a hassle to get resolved. 2. A friend of mine had sent us a bottle of champagne as gift but I didn't find out until he called me and asked why i didn't call him and say thank you. Maybe it's because the hotel never sent it, although they told him otherwise. 3. The hotel has a nice car service that will take guests anywhere in a 2.0 mile radius. My wife and I had reservations at a restaurant that was 2.2 miles from the hotel and the concierge told my wife it wasn't possible to use the car. I politely reminded the concierge that it was our honeymoon and he begrudgingly allowed us to use the car but it had to be on his time line.

I have probably stayed in over 20 hotels in LA. This trip was over a weekend and the BF and I decided to make it a little vacation.Santa Monica is my preference (Shutters, Le Merigot) and in West Hollywood, we prefer The London. SLS is a Starwood and I have stayed in my share of W Hotels- from Chicago to Istanbul- so I am familar with the \"cool\" attitude at these properties. SLS sounded like an upbeat, fun choice in Beverly Hills. The restaurant garners great reviews (and deservedly) but the hotel was a disaster from the minute we arrived. Our room was on the 2nd floor and even with every light on, it was dark. There were not any drawers to put clothes. There wasn't even a luggage stand. Our bags had to stay out for the entire 5 days. In the middle of the mirrored room. I switched to a room on the 4th floor in hopes of getting a bit more light. The maintenance team eventually had to bring me lamps. The bathroom is black -and more dark! There is a bizarre window that opens so you can watch the TV/bed and brush your teeth. This wasn't cool- it was stupid. But you had to keep it open to get light. Putting on makeup was a total disaster. The makeup mirror gave us minimal light as well. Ironing board was a mini one and since there wasn't any where to put it, the BF ironed his shirts while kneeling on the floor. The room was useless and not at all comfortable. It was hard to organize stuff, and felt cluttered and messy at all times. On the first morning, we forgot to hit the \"make up room\" switch (yes, switch) next to the door and were treated to an unmade room at 5pm. Service was abominable. The concierge was downright rude. When I asked for an umbrella (our room was mysteriously missing it!) she told me they were all out and I had to wait. Indefinitely. It was pouring rain. When I asked for a car service to take me to a drugstore she told me it was already gone and I could wait. Indefinitely. Or have the hotel run errands for me at a $20 service fee. I complained to the manager and was given an umbrella immediately. I will never stay at the SLS again. Nothing was pleasant about this experience- except when we got to check out.

We came back to the hotel with colleagues after an evening out. I have stayed here once a month( usually 3-5 nights) for the past year. I feel like staff should know me but they don't, just not the kind of place that seems to bother or perhaps too much turnover? We tried to have tea/drinks in the quieter part of the lobby. They told us to go to the other lobby. They could not serve since they were setting up for breakfast. We were told to get up and move to another area 3 times until finally I mentioned that I had stayed in the hotel a dozen times and that they were being totally inhospitable. It was frankly sort of embarrassing. A manager would tell us we could sit in one place and then another or a server would say we could not. As hotel guests we were told that the desert tables were reserved for diners from the restaurant as part of the \" experience\" . I have eaten in the restaurant and was never made aware of \" the experience\". It sounded ridiculous. We were trying to have a couple of cocktails, maybe some appetizers and tea at 11:00 on a Friday night. Trying to cop a NY attitude in LA just doesn't work for me...especially when I am a hotel guest not a clubber...so annoying. It just feels very bar like...so if you are going for that you might enjoy it. Room service portions are very small. Decor is fun and original as are slogans around the hotel.

Ended up here in this hotel. The room I stayed in on the 7th floor (suite) was spacious and very attractively designed in the style of the hotel design by Philippe Stark. Initially it reminded me of the Royalton Hotel in New York where I stayed in the 1980s. You either like it or hate it. Fully agree with the hotel\u2019s website that the hotel challenges traditional convention on luxury hospitality. The hotel houses a vibrant and very good restaurant (always full, make reservations!). As I cannot sleep when light comes in the room I asked \u2013and got - a room with darkened curtains. Very sleek, exceptional, great hotel room. The bed was nice, service good and timely. A new star in Beverly Hills and certainly worth a try. My gut feel though is that you need to explore the rooms before making your choice which one to stay in.

I got lots of appologies from the front desk at midnight and the following morning when we checked out - but in all my travels (and I do alot of traveling) NO hotel has ever not made up my room before. It was not a mistake, they did not do my daughter's either. SImple unexplained incomptence. Checkout (we checked out at different times) took 20 minutes. The hotel had not deducted for a 20% spa credit, and meal/beverage coupons. The front desk could not look at the details of each transaction so they had to call the spa and restaurant for details for all the transactions. Because it could not be figured out expeditiously, the manager gave us an additional $50 off the bill. We accepted the rebate as close enough, after all we had a plane to catch. Structurally, the hotel is very avant-guarde. The bathrooms have two \"barn\" doors. They are not very soundproof and you heard much more bathroom noise in the bedroom than you should.

Rooms are still a bit style over substance, especially for a long term guest, but overall this could be on its way to be a very smart, hip, hotel with great service (if they keep it up).

I'm going to write the next review and my stay went. Check in/Check out So we arrived at this beautiful hotel through the Red Carpet. The check-in wan't what I was hopping. I had already paid my full stay through Expedia but they still needed a Credit Card which I don't have, last time at the Beverly Hilton they just ask me for a 200 usd deposit, but at first the guy just told us \"This isn't how we do it here\" a bit rude, but after checking with his manager we just put a deposit. The check out was very good and fast. Normally it's at 12:00 p.m. but they leave us check out until 1:00 p.m. without charges Because of the guy rudeness Im putting a 4.1 out of 5 Room The room was very nice with two double beds. The bathroom had a shower, which I thought it was a tub, and some great body lotions and shampoos. The t.v. is probably the coolest t.v. I've ever seen in a hotel, inside a furniture, WOW! There is also a desk with an internet cable (it should be already included!). What I really thought it was a bit dangerous it was the metals next to each bed and the lamp of the desk, my son hit himself twice!! I booked the room and the flight together but the room itself was about 230 usd per night, very good price and it was a Premiere room, which cost me 20 usd in total more and the only extra is that we were at the last floor and had two bottles of Evian. Before coming we asked for a nice view of the hills and 50% of our view was the Hospital, then a little bit some buildings and just a bit of the hills. The pool has better views and is on the 6th floor. I really liked the room I just thought the view could have been better. I give out a 4.6 out of 5 Restaurant We never had lunch/dinner at The Bazaar but it seemed cool. Anyways we had breakfast at the TRES, very expensive. Their eggs for adults are just greats but for kids are not. The food was good but seriously 8 usd for an orange juice? I know it's Beverly Hills but it just seems a lot. And then we had an issue the last morning with the waiter ALEX, he was asking something and I was translating it to my son, and because we didn't order he really got angry. The mexican waiter and the blond lady were just amazing in their work. Price, service and because of food I give a 4.4. Location I think this hotel has the best locationI've ever stayed at L.A. Last time I stayed at the Beverly hilton and the Beverly Wilshire both at Beverly Hills, but I'm not going to buy at Rodeo Drive so this hotel is just great. At the edge of Beverly Hills, is just 2 blocks away from the Beverly Center mall. There is a beautiful house car that it was always available so it can drive you to The Grove, Hollywood Blvd, Robertson, etc.. The best thing is that I didn't had car, (parking is 33 usd a night, EXPENSIVE!), and I spent less than 200 usd of taxi, including to the airport. The only bad thing is that is right to a hospital, so at least you will hear a lot of ambulances I give out a 4.9 Service Well apart from the Alex at the Tres and the check-in guy everything else was great. The housekeeping, the driver, the waiters, the concierge were very good. The concierge mad our stay. First we asked for a tour next day for the celeb house, but apparently he thought we didn't want it so he didn't booked it, but anyways Alex (Concierge) booked us for the best private tour of the Celebrity Houses, THE BEST TOUR I'VE EVER TAKEN. I will give out a 4.7 Amenities The hotel has a great pool at the 6th floor but because of the weather we didn't used but it was a really glamorous pool. I liked the House Car service, it saved us a lot of $$. There is also a business center, 6 usd for 15 minutes! and there is a Spa and a Fitness Center which looked fine. Apparently if you have a dog they will also give you an amenity kit. I give out a 4.7 Value/Price We booked the whole trip with Expedia and it was 2000 usd for 3 with airplane included from Mexico and 3 nights. So yes! it was less than 250 usd per night. I've seen reviews that said that it's the same price like the Four Seasons, but not for me. Something I really didn't liked was the over-priced breakfast. I give out 4.8 Overall. Great hotel, with bizarre decoration, I've never got to know what kind of decoration was, but still cool. It has an amazing pool and staff. The rooms are just very nice and the location is the best part. So the big question? Would I will stay here again? 90% yes, if I can find a low rate like this one, but I might try another hotel.

A special mention must go to both Alex and Cassey who in particular gave us a 1st class service from recommending restaurants, bars and clubs, to booking taxis and car rentals. The hotel itself is well decorated and the room was furnished to a high and modern standard. I like hard mattresses but theirs is medium firm which is why I only give it 4 star. It is situated 5-10 mins walk from Robertson Boulevard where you can find many shops and only 5 mins walk from 3rd where you'll find several good breakfast/lunch restaurants - Toast soon became our favourite - their french toast and berries is in a league of its own! The lively Sunset Blvd and Santa Monica Blvd are only a $6-8 taxi away but if you're anything like us and like to get about the area then a car rental is probably the more economical option as they can soon mount up. FYI our car rental and hotel parking came to just under $400 for the week with their insurance. I'd book in advance and take out your own insurance as it'll reduce the bill significantly - $300 should do it! The Santa Monica and Venice beaches are only about a 15-20 min drive away with Malibu about 30 min but expect a 1-1.5hr journey back if you travel between 3.30 and 6.30... Downtown where you can find Chinatown, Little Tokyo, a great restaurant/patisserie called Louis ... is a 15-20min drive away. Not quite like Manhattan but interesting enough to visit. One word of advice we learned the hard way was the taxi from the airport to hotel. Its a very straight forward route - 2 streets. Go north east on La Tijera and this will take you onto La Cienega where the hotel is situated. It should cost around $35 maybe less. You do not need to go on the freeway which our driver did and it cost $60! If you're renting a car maybe the airport is the best place to pick up from as it pays itself both there and back.

It was a great experience overall and we will be returning next year to celebrate my 50th as well. We flew in to Burbank Airport, although the hotel is almost the same distance from LAX. The hotel does not offer shuttle services to the airports although they will arrange car services upon request. Cab fare from Burbank to the SLS will run you about $55 if there isn\u2019t any traffic, so plan accordingly when deciding whether it is more cost effective to hire a car service or take a cab. STAFF The hotel staff and service are incredible. Concierge - I was in email contact with our concierge, Alex Niezgoda, several times prior to our arrival. Alex was able to readily obtain the reservations for even some of the toughest restaurants for us, as well as being a valuable source of information. Once we arrived, we received excellent and professional service from all of the concierge staff. BONUS points for Alex\u2019s expertise and assistance. Bell Captain/Valet \u2013 friendly, efficient service every time Front Desk \u2013 Also friendly, slightly less efficient, but still exceptional. Minor hitch \u2013 we had requested early check in because our flight arrived a bit before noon. Upon arrival, our room wasn\u2019t quite ready. However, the Bell Captain secured our luggage and we went to lunch at Tres while we were waiting. As soon as it was ready, they came and found us in Tres and brought us the keys. Housekeeping \u2013 great job! Our room was spotless throughout our stay. Transportation \u2013 BONUS points for our driver, Daniel. The SLS has three vehicles available to take guests to any destination within a 3 mile radius of the hotel \u2013 an Audi, a Range Rover, and the \u201cjet van\u201d. Bear in mind that the hotel does not provide return service so keep your cell phone handy to call Yellow Cab to pick you up when you are ready to go back to the hotel. I would suggest sticking with Yellow and avoiding United as we had a very bad experience with a United driver \u201cgetting lost\u201d. We were lucky enough to have Daniel as our driver throughout our stay, and we can\u2019t say enough about what a wonderful job he does. Daniel is extremely knowledgable about the area in particular and LA in general. He was a significant contributor to making our trip stress free and successful. Wait Staff \u2013 TRES \u2013 our waiter at Tres was Alexander. Excellent service, cheerfully provided, with solid knowledge of the menu. Kudos to Alexander. BAZAAR \u2013 our waiter was the one true DISAPPOINTMENT of the weekend, the only NEGATIVE to our experience. We had a 6:30 reservation on Sunday, the 24th. We sat at a table in the red room right in front of the cotton candy machine. Our waiter was more interested in repeatedly, loudly, berating one of his colleagues who was serving \u2013 or trying to serve \u2013 a nearby table than he was in answering our questions regarding the menu. Every time we started to ask him a question he would suddenly dart away and begin chastising the other server. It\u2019s a good thing that the rest of the Bazaar serving staff filled in the gap, as our main server was largely absent until the end of the meal. His behavior made all of the guests distinctly uncomfortable. While I certainly intend to eat at Bazaar again next year, I am hoping that I will not be subjected to that server\u2019s unacceptable behavior when we return. His lack of respect and poor performance stood out that much more strongly in comparison to the gracious service we received from everyone else we dealt with at the hotel. THE FACILITIES The Room \u2013 We stayed in Room 523, a Premier Double. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the D Porthault sheets are a treat. I love the clean, modern lines of the room and the minimal clutter. At the SLS it is all about the unique details \u2013 like the ironing board with the open bird cage on the cover, and the flying bird on the back wall of the closet. The bathroom, with its sliding walls is elegant, yet comfortable. If you are short like I am though, be very careful with the deep soaking tub. It can be tough to climb back out of! I think half the fun of staying at the SLS is wandering through the public areas trying to spot as many of the funky and whimsical elements that are at the core of its design. If Tim Burton has designed a hotel, the SLS would be the result. FOOD Jose Andres and his team \u2013 Wow! Don\u2019t bother eating anywhere else while you are there. Stick to Bazaar and Tres.

It is a great location in Beverly Hills and easily accessible. The Hotel is similar in style to a Schrager hotel - oversized pieces in the reception area, digital art, mood lighting and sound. So from the get go I would say that unless you place some value on innovative design and modern interpretations it is not going to be for you and that you would be better off with a more traditional luxury hotel. I am Platinum with Starwood, booked a standard room and got a Terrace Room which has a decent outside space - a nice option. So check in desk was exceptionally helpful, in fact the experience with all the staff has been positive from the lobby to the two restaurants to the valets. The rooms value design over function - expensive custom furniture and lighting, an oversized shower (no bath) - but very little space for clothing and storage. There are opulent touches such as the hand blown glass lighting, smoked mirror that hides a TV and custom Stark furniture. Beds are very comfortable. Couple of comments: the oversized toiletry bottles are not for take away and I personally like the large bottles as opposed to fiddling with tiny things to squeeze out little globs. However, although the texture of the products are very nice the SLS have missed a trick by not having a signature scent for any of the products - they are simply bland. The towels too are not bath sheets and feel rather cheap to me for a hotel of this standard. The bath robes though are large and luxurious - the kind you want to lounge in all day. Food for breakfast is expensive other then the buffet which again is innovative and a nice follow through from the superlative Bazaaar which is a must try - incredible food. The pool area can be a little intimidating - clearly pitched to the beautiful people of LA but again I found no problem with the attitude of the staff there. Valet was efficient - you pay the one charge for the entire day, in and out as many times as you want.

We stayed at SLS because of Bazaar and the reputation of Jose Andres. To me the hotel is kind of a juiced up W where the guest better be willing to part with a LOT of cash. When I checked in I was told I was upgraded to a Studio Suite and that room is the only room they upgrade Platinum members. I would love to see a standard room, because our room would not be described by many people as a suite. Was it somewhat larger than a typical hotel room....maybe? I guess it would depend on who you were talking to. So we got upgraded to a larger room and the decor is very typical of a W. I thought the amenities were tacky. They provide oversized plastic bottles of shampoo, body wash, conditioner, which I am positive that if a guest took one they would get charged. For those of you who enjoy taking nice amenities when you leave, there's NO reason to take them. When I'm dropping well in excess of $300/night on a hotel room I want to see L'Occitane or Bulgari or something name brand plastered on the amenities. I don't want to see generic \"made for the SLS\" shampoo. Furthermore, do I want to handle the soap bottle after the last guest who used the toilet or had God knows what else on his hands? This was a bigger issue for me. Yeah, it's a funky quirky vibe the designers are going for with the reusable soaps/conditioner, and I'm sure it's green because they aren't wasting as much plastic, but I'm about not handling things other people have handled. As per other guests critiques, there isn't a bathtub, probably because there isn't room for it, even though we were supposedly upgraded to a suite! HA. Closet space is fine, but the ironing board is a strange little thing meant to sit on the table top. I've never seen anything like it. CHEAP would be the word that comes to mind. It wasn't trendy or minimalist, so all I can think is they needed to save money. The rooms are HIP, modern and minimalist. If you're not comfortable walking through a Design Within Reach store then this isn't the place for you to stay. A friend suggested it's more along the lines of Roche Bobois, but I can guarantee the furnishings don't come anywhere near the price point of Roche. Lighting is dim, which wasn't a problem for us, but others might not enjoy the look. I actually thought the room was quite pleasant and the bed quite comfortable, but CLEARLY not worth the final bill. So, other details. The Sunday brunch was $38/person and $48 with a cava Mimosa. We thought it was too much like a continental breakfast. Little pastries, chocolate, yogurt, fruit cups. There was caviar (we don't eat caviar) and there was Lox and also some roast beef being carved....otherwise it felt like continental breakfast on steroids. We opted for the choice without the cava Mimosa. Price for two with tax and tip $96. Not exactly a bargain. Parking $35. Depending on your arrival and departure from the hotel I would suggest parking on the street around the hotel and using meters. With a little ingenuity you can bypass the fee. On Sunday we sat poolside (it's a small pool) on the 6th floor and enjoyed watching the 20 somethings that the hotel personnel kept escorting up to the pool area. The signs are explicit that hotel guests only are at the pool, but we noticed that the younger set would be escorted from the lobby by the help and allowed into the pool area, which was packed and had a variety of guests waiting for cabanas and chairs. There is a DJ on Sundays and the music is thumping. This is the same company that owns the Abbey nightclub in West Hollywood and I think they are trying to cultivate an atmostphere at the pool and fill it with young Hollywood wannabees who think it's glamorous to have entree into a swank hotel's pool area for a Sunday DJ party. We had two drinks, thank God. The mojito is just $16 and a Campari $13. With automatic 20% gratuity added and the tax we went back to our room with a $38 bill....for two drinks!!! The Sangria is $50 a pitcher, so imagine with food what kind of bill some guests run up during the day. One of my friends who parties constantly around Beverly Hills suggested that SLS attracts a lot of younger wealthy persian/middle eastern 20 somethings. I thought that was an odd comment, until we got to the pool on Sunday. Same with Bazaar, the later it got the more it felt like a Persian nightclub. And the best part for the hotel is they appeared to be spending, spending, spending. Dinner at Bazaar was wonderful. $55 prix fixe is the way to go. They have several tapas and unless you just want one or two items, it will be far cheaper to order the set tasting menu. Also, we chose to drink tap water over the sparkling or still they try to sell. Most are only $10 a bottle and yes they have quite a selection. Some of the beer is reasonably priced as is iced tea and sodas. Hot tea $8. Here the cocktails are as high as $20 each and the wines can become stratospheric. It is a wonderful wine list with equally wonderful mark-ups from the labels we recognized. The staff was nice and we had no needs. The gym is great. It's got excellent new equipment and I would highly recommend it. Some woman at the pool was carrying on about her spa treatments.....apparently she wasn't impressed, especially when she got her bill. I'm not sure whether she didn't like noises she heard or whether her services just weren't up to her level of desire. So would we stay here again? After all for one night, brunch, prix fixe dinner and two cocktails at the pool we checked out with a nearly $600 bill. NEVER. It wasn't worth it. We've paid more than that on a few occasions previously, but this just didn't cut it. Would I recommend Bazaar? Absolutely.

So, once in the shower, i couldn't change the temperature, or between the different shower types. It looks cool but isn't practical. The best part of my stay was breakfast. I had a truly delicious omelette with cheese and wild mushrooms. I will make a point to come to the hotel next time I'm in LA. I won't stay here, but I will definitely eat here.

Really cool and beautiful hotel with a good location near shopping and restaurants and service minded staff. Though I do think the lighting is too dark for a business traveller with work to do, as previous reviewers have mentioned. The pool on the roof is also very nice. There is nothing wrong with the hotel, it is really beautiful and rooms are lovely with comfortable beds and amazing bathrooms. TV is an enormous flat screen and everything is just top class. My only negative comments are the overly expensive extras, that should not be extras in a hotel of this standard. Internet costs 13 dollars per DAY, which is just crazy these days, especially when they make a big deal about lending you a lap top... For the loan of an adapter I was charged 15 (refundable, of course) and breakfast is a massive 25 for the tasty but somewhat small buffet. This to me seems strange when rooms are quite pricy and clientel posh - do I really need to first reserve 500 dollars on my credit card for minibar and then 15 for an adapter? And to me 500 dollars for an overnight stay is way too much money. I also think it's strange not to give any extras at a hotel of this standard. Internet costs as does everything in the room, and I mean e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g. From the small piece of chocolate to the designer dice to the minibar snacks to the schampoo bottles - everything has a price tag. And you do not get anything when you check in, not even a mint on the pillow. When you pay for this standard a complementary fruit basket would be a nice touch. Instead you have a 10 dollar price tag on the bottle of water that looked like a welcoming gift. Unclassy. I stayed in a room with an extra door, I guess it can be opened to make the next door room to a family room. This caused me problems. My neighbour decided to take someone \"home\" for the night and woke me up at 3:30. I thought I had Mary J Blige in my room but soon noticed it was his stereo blasting away. I called about this twice and the second time he kind of got the message. I was able to fall asleep but I do wish they had been more firm. I told them I had been travelling for almost 24 hours and had meetings in the morning but they where unable to just tell my neighbour that music is not ok AT ALL at 4 in the morning... At 7 I was woken up by some lovely moaning that really did not leave anything to the imagination. This is just silly for a hotel that wants to be sleek and cool. They should invest in some soundproofed doors. I hate to think what small kids would have been asking mommy would they have stayed in my room.

As a hotel guest, I agree with other reviewers on some things that aren't great for a business traveler, such as the dim lighting in the rooms. On this trip I had a few issues that have turned me off quite a bit, which is a shame because i want to like this place! I left my room at 7am, returned at 5pm and the room had not been made up. I was deciding whether or not to call and complain/request when there was a knock at the door. The housekeeping staff asked, \"do you want your room cleaned?\". It just seemed really late and half-hearted. I said no thanks. I also noticed that the shelving around the bed was very dusty - looks like it hadn't been properly cleaned in a few weeks. The bathroom sink had a very slow drain, which is a bit unpleasant with those giant sinks. The biggest turnoff, however, was my experience in the bar/restaurant. Was seated (solo) promptly in the practically empty space. It took quite some time for anyone to come over and acknowledge me - first water, then several minutes later a waiter. I ordered a gin & tonic and a salad for dinner. Took way longer than it should have for the drink to arrive, when it did I noticed/commented that it looked fancy and the waiter agreed. I enjoyed my drink and meal and requested the check. $18 for the gin & tonic!!! I was shocked, the waiter wasn't around and I needed to get going, so I paid the bill but on my way out checked with the hostess. I asked if the drink I ordered is considered a \"regular\" gin & tonic (I still had the remainder with me). She replied that no, it was considered their SLS Utlimate drink, which had been noted on the bill. I was explaining that I did not order the special version and that I was surprised at the cost and she replied, \"well, are you enjoying it?\". Please! At that point the waiter came over seeing that I was talking to the hostess and he had some lame explanation that \"most people\" order the ultimate so that's what he got for me, and he offered an apology - but not to refund the difference in price or any other kind of compensation. I should have demanded that but frankly I had an appointment to get to and had to go. Bottom line, I felt taken advantage of, and when I called them on it they didn't handle it well at all.

We called the operator to try and find out what was happening, but no response. So we went outside with other guests. Clearly there weren't enough staff and those that were there did not take charge. There was never an \"all clear\" announcement given and guests returned to their room on their own. We did complain the next morning and staff were apologetic. A complimentary night was given as compensation, but then the next day we had the same trouble with housekeeping.

Sometimes all it takes is just one person to make the difference... For the highlight of our trip, we went to the spa to relax and indulge. Upon checking in we were rudely ignored by a very flustered and stressed out lady who could not force a smile on her face. After burdening her with our check in, we were nicely escorted to the spa where our day got a little better. Our treatments and therapists were great and we were feeling very pampered. Throughly relaxed and rejuvenated, we went to check out, totally forgetting about the lovely lady at the front (whom we have come to find out is the Manager, Amanda). I guess we may have been looking for some sort of an apology or smile, but realizing all we were going to get was a single finger up in the air, telling us, \"one minute\". I guess we do not have to explain how all of our pampering went right out of the window!

The staff at the Pool and the Pool itself were both AWESOME. Great for the relaxed young crowd. 6. Room to room insulation, and outside noise insulation is first class and whisper quiet. 7. The Gym was indeed world class - good job! 8. the Business centre PC's were good with free Airline Check in service (nice touch) Negatives: 1. no real views from this location, not the hotels fault. 2. There is absolutely no \"in room\" sound privacy, if someone is in the bathroom, you hear everything (sorry to be so frank) unfortunately this is a real life design fault. Design vs practicality. 3. The amount of people through the hotel is large and that leads to some unfortunate issues: Concierge was very efficient but not warm, \"Bazar\" restaurant waiters are \"too cool\" and rarely present (getting the bill took 15 minutes+). My friendly recommendation: I would strongly recommend the SLS management team to visit the W Hollywood, whose staff were so friendly and amazing they made the hotel world class.

You will not be disappointed. This Alice-in-Wonderland-esq hotel is the perfect spot for a weekend get away or, say...a wedding. (I, myself have done both there.) If you're looking for a space that will amaze you and create an unforgettable experience from the food to the service to the decor, this is it. I had heard about the SLS becuase of all the press coverage about their recent opening. To be honest, we were nervous they would not have any kinks worked out since they were new on the scene. We were also afraid they may be pretentious, expensive, and difficult to work with becuase they cater to a wealthy celebrity clientelle. But, from the moment we stepped inside, we knew we were wrong. This place was unbelievable, the staff was friendly and warm, and the prices were reasonable. The food, staff, service, decor, location, amenities, and ambiance are all top of the line. The design is chic, modern, hip, and eclectic. It's like you've stepped into another world when the doors open. Not only did the place look amazing, but it didn't cost an arm and a leg to stay there. It was $299 per night for a suite in the summer time. Pretty amazing for a five star hotel. And you don't just get a beautifully appointed room for that price. The Spa is so chic and calming. The staff are friendly and inviting and give you one heck of a manicure. The hotel also has an amazing pool surrounded by giant mirrors and beautiful people. The staff are attentive and accomodating and the atmosphere is upbeat but still super chill. You should not miss it. I'm told there's also a great work-out room, but I was too busy eating, drinking, and being married (pun intended) to notice. Maybe next time. And, let's not forget the food. The food is incredible. I've eaten at every restaurant in the hotel, and the food is amazing no matter where you're sitting. The Bazaar is one of the few four star restaurants in LA. Famed chef Jose Andres runs the joint. If you don't know who he is, Google him. You'll see why the food is something to talk about. The restuarant focuses on small plates, but you can get entree sized portions as well. The menu is creative (fois gras cotton candy) and inventive and is incredibly delicious. They have the best bread in the entire world. I don't know what they do to it, but don't miss out on the tomato bread they make. It's to die for and goes perfectly with a charcuterie and cheese plate. Die. The food at our wedding was equally as amazing as if you're dining directly in the Bazaar. We had an assorment of delicious hot and cold appetizers (including a killer mini kobe beef burger) for the cocktail hour. As a kind gesture, Dana Cohen (the catering manager/wedding/event planner/the best thing that ever happened to LA weddings) also threw in a complimentary caprihina (a popular Brazilian beverage) bar for our guests. At dinner we had a tomato, basil, mozzerella salad that was full of flavor and freshness. Next, our guests dined on ribeye or seabass and ended with a chocolate cake. The wine pairings were also perfect. We also had cookies flown in from an Italian bakery in Brooklyn to accompany the complimentary coffee bar after dinner. And then, ater a few hours of dancing, Dana arranged for our guests to enjoy mini gelato cones. Also complimentary. I'm telling you, they really know how to do it right. They don't miss a beat. The entire staff is kind, patient, helpful, friendly, knowledgeable, professional, and had amazing contacts and recommendations. The hotel is also centrally located. You can be shopping and dining in Hollywood or Beverly Hills in minutes, or you can be at the Santa Monica Pier or Downtown LA in a short 20-30 minute car ride. It's the perfect location. I can't even tell you how happy we were to have our wedding at the SLS. Our friends and family are still talking about what an amazing weekend it was. My husband and I wll definitely be back to the hotel for dinner and we even plan on staying another weekend or two a year.., And, I live in LA.

To be honest, the best thing about the SLS had been LEAVING this spot. The \"cool\" SLS hotel is run by a bunch of unprofessional youngsters who know nothing about \"luxury\" and \"service\". The hotel is very modern and chic, a bit similar to a nice W hotel of SPG. The lobby is very nice and tasteful. When I checked in I got a room which was nothing else as standard, even I've got Platinum status. Only after I complained I got another room which I would also concider \"standard\". Since it took too long until my luggage arrived at my room and I had to leave for business I asked them to take out my jackets and hang them.

The rooms just aren't as inviting as they could be as the furnishings are a little stark and uncomfortable (and I love modern--it just needs to be more user-friendly).

Actually, most staffers at W's are really as friendly as someone at a Homewood Suites (which is probably one of my favourite brands). The SLS is like a W, in fact, but not really a Luxury Collection Hotel...at least during my stay it definitely had a mover/shaker busybody feel, and whether it was due to the crowds, not sure if property could fulfill expectation, regardless, I found most staffers quite genial, but it only takes 1, in this case my check-in host, to make me question who is the guest and who is the staffer - a smile and hello can go a long way vs. a stiff \"may I help you?\" Upon checking me in, with his Twilight inspired demeanor, I asked about internet and was told there was a fee, but after re-stating my status, I was told it didn't really apply, since after double checking it was included in room rate. Outside of the shaky start, most of lukewarm reception was due to room design. An odd club-inspired bathroom Most of my other complaints are around the area of getting prepared for the day (or the night) depending on activity. The bathrooms are dark and counter space is limited, almost non-existent due to the kitchen-sized sink in the bathroom. Mirrors abound (even in the shower) so you should be comfortable with your body at all times (even while in the shower). The shower was a bit awkward, at first inspired looking drainage system, but as I showered as the water failed to move down the drawn, I found myself standing in a puddle of water (never fun in any shower). The shower door did not create a watertight seal, so a little water sprayed out through the sides. Oh and lastly I don't understand the concept of shared toiletries -green indeed, but 1) they didn't seem special and 2) how many people have used this bottle of shampoo? Thankfully I travel with usually travel with my own anyway. After the bath, it was time for wardrobe, and well, I was surprised to find a mini iron board available...unfortunately my gnome did not join me on his trip, so I did encounter some challenges with ironing (and once again find a plug for the iron). When you finally did make it out, most of it was good, enjoyed the restaurant immensely, always enjoy roof pools (though 1 was more ornamental than purposeful) and a scene it was (but fully expected), fitness center was phenomenal and the house car and driver were distinguished. Final Outcome That said, it still feels a amalgamation of a lounge and a hotel where style did trump substance and experience (at least from a hotel development standpoint). A very cool hotel, with very posh notes but almost seeming designed by someone who is better tailored for other areas of hospitality or Vegas. True luxury? No. Fun? Sorta. Stay again?

Yes. \"Free\". I decided to cash in my Starwood free weekend night reward at the best that Starwood had to offer in LA, and live it up. Of course, nothing really comes free in LA, which is to be expected. Parking (valet only) is $35.20/night ($32 + $3.20 tax). And eating, drinking, and tipping for all the excellent service offered at the hotel will rack up a pretty hefty balance by the end of any stay. The front desk was as efficient as possible at prime time (3pm) on a Friday afternoon...though perhaps a little too efficient. Made my way to my room (316), which turned out to be an accessible room. I really wished that the front desk person had notified me about this or asked if this was okay with me, because it was not. I'm not a fan of open or only curtained-off showers that get the whole bathroom floor wet, or wardrobes where the rod is situated so low that the bottom of my hanging dresses are crumpled on the closet floor. Though, these things are clearly important for someone wheelchair-bound. And for an accessible room it was really nice, otherwise. Called down to the front desk from the room and asked for a room change. There wasn't another one available 'til 530pm though, so they promised to call and let me know when it was ready, via my cell. So, my friend and I got changed and went up to relax at the pool on the 6th floor. Pool area is more \"seen and be seen\" and \"group tanning salon\" than \"let's get your swim on\". It gets crowded on the weekend, and it's a little confusing at first trying to find an empty chaise or daybed. There seems to only be one guy who's in charge of handing out towels at the entrance, as well as taking the old ones away from the chaises when ppl leave. Often, people are deterred from claiming a vacated chair because the used towels and leftover food/drink trays are left there for so long. I think this could be addressed if the servers who are walking the pool perimeter better communicate with the towel guy or participate in bussing after the departing guests themselves. But once you have a spot, it's a nice place to relax on a hot day, with some cool drinks and lunch/snack. It is a small space though, and no offense to people who have families, but the peace is kind of disrupted when people bring their gaggle of young children up to the pool. The atmosphere at this hotel is pretty adult-oriented and it surprises me that people would want to bring their kids here. I can imagine what kids might do to the abundant reflective surfaces in the rooms, and I shudder for the housekeeping staff. After a few hours, returned to room 316; still no word from front desk, so called down again, and this time they sent up a bellman to help move us. Bobby the \"Luggage Ambassador\" showed up and he was great. Moved us to a second floor terrace room (sliding glass door leads to a furnished patio area). Superior rooms are about 402 sq. ft, of swanky modern style. Lots of tinted reflective surfaces, square edges, leather, glass, low lighting, 300 thread count sheets, and tongue in cheek decorative touches. Large shower-only in bathroom, no tub. The mini-bar is not so mini. It's pretty awesome actually. Full-sized bottles of several premium liquors (including Patron), lots of snack variety, mini fridge with all the rest of the usual suspects. And the best part - NO BIBLE! Yes, Finally! The only things I'd change in the room is to 1: make the safe easier to access for someone shorter than 5'8\" (at 5'3\" I could reach in, it was just difficult to see if I'd gotten everything out...maybe add a curved mirror to the inside roof of the safe?), and 2: it would be nice if the room had a folding luggage rack. The hotel is gorgeous and fun and the hotel staff are attentive service-providers. Big, fancy gym and business center are open 24/7. Restaurants are impressive-looking spaces. The Bazaar is amazing and YUMMY, and attracts a huge following, esp on weekend nights. Hotel guests have priority for reservations at The Bazaar and other SBE-managed hot spots (Katsuya, Area, Hyde, The Abbey, XIV, etc.). The concierge staff (Alex and Freddo) were knowledgeable and helpful, and Neil the doorman/Valet director extraordinaire was really on the ball. And I'd like to thank Dan, one of our house car drivers who literally stopped traffic to help us get to our destination across the street. Overall, this hotel feels like a hip 5 star Vegas boutique hotel; I've stayed at the Encore, Wynn, TheHotel, Caesar's, and Venetian, and other than the lack of a bathtub, and all of those other things that make Vegas mega-resorts feel bloated, the SLS has \"it\" - the glamor, luxury, indulgent atmosphere, and the beautiful people. Come here to indulge and have a good time, but like Vegas, leave the kids and penny-pinching at home.

I have to say that I was totally impressed with the SLS. To me, it is a luxury hotel that has no trouble making fun of it's luxury moniker. My room was very nice. I loved that bed and the TV in the mirror. I loved the bathroom. Yes, it's dark, but I had no problem with that. There was a lighted makeup mirror on the table to help out. I really wish I could take that whole room and transplant it into my house - it's what I'd like as my master suite at home!

They even asked if I would like a late checkout, which I was going to ask for (it's usually like pulling teeth to get a late c/o). I really enjoyed the outdoor lounge at the guest entrance - comfy chairs to sit and watch the people coming and going. The location of the SLS was just fine for me. I got to walk over to Beverly Center for some shopping (boy has that mall changed for the better!!). It was a short drive up to Hollywood to meet up with some friends and eat a Roscoe's. I wish I had more time to spend at the hotel that time. If I get back to L.A., I will be sure to check for a room at the SLS. It's definitely not for everyone, but for those who can have a sense of humor and are not expecting a stuffy \"luxury\" hotel, it's a great place.

The SLS is the latest in the highest tier of Starwood properties they entitle the Luxury Collection. It's a high-end place combining luxury and scene, not unlike the London West Hollywood (where I usually stay). The hotel is located a block north of Wilshire on La Cienega in the space occupied formerly by Le Meridien. Service was good without being too much (which you can sometimes get at, say, the Mandarin Oriental). You are greeted by name, and everyone is friendly. That said, luggage was slow in coming up (could have been that I was a little tired after also driving 35 to 40 minutes from Long Beach after a six-hour flight). The room itself was impeccably furnished and they did a great job with style. It's quirky and fun but also very luxurious. For example, they don't tell you what \"SLS\" stands for, so the hotel is filled with little phrases using those letters. The laundry bag says \"Swift Laundry Service,\" for example, while the bag for your shoes is entitled \"Shiny Leather Shoes.\" Cute. The decor is somewhere between being very hip and playful, with a hint of sexy (the bed is in the middle of the room, with all the decor being darkened mirrors). Stylewise, they're going towards the single-room concept, so even the large doors that slide separating the room from the bathroom slide open to allow you to peek into the oversized shower. Fun. The bed was the best I've slept on. I would buy my own if I could. Location was typical Beverly Hills...painful to get to from the freeway, but very near to a lot of things once settled in (Beverly Center within walking distance, as is Matsuhisa and many other restaurants on La Cienega's famed Restaurant Row). The hotel is very big on melding scene and luxury, but they do a good job of keeping the scene (the restaurant and the bar) away from the rooms. The rooms are quiet, and you can sleep wonderfully, or you can walk to the other part of the hotel and mingle with the young Hollywood crowd, the cougars, and the beautiful people. I was there on business, and it was nice having the option of bringing clients to the hotel and not having to move around. The one hiccup? The second night I was there, I went to bed at 11 pm and needed to wake up at 3:45 am for work. The fire alarm screamed at 2:45 am, then again at 2:50 am, then three more times. Evidently it was a false alarm and they tried to rectify it, but it took some time. Needless to say, I wasn't happy. The management did the best they could and acknowledged the issue and apologized profusely. In the end, they offered me a solution that I was happy with and I felt that I would like to give them another chance to become the regular hotel that I stay at in LA.

We got cleaned up and headed down to Tres where the bartender took good care of us and even took back a drink I wasn't satisfied with and made it right, no problem! 5 cocktails later we wandered over to Bazaar where the concierge was supposed to have made a reservation for our party.

Turn it down and within a minute or two it's where you want it to be. Staff? All very friendly and attentive.

The hotel definitely makes a good first impression. The service was quite professional, and despite looking a tad grungy after our day at Universal Studios, and despite coming in on a \"free\" night, I was made to feel like an honored Gold SPG guest. I was told that instead of the handicapped room the SPG phone rep said I would have to settle for, I would get an upgraded room on the top (7th) floor, and my internet and room water would be complimentary as an SPG Gold guest. I did not at all get this courtesy when I checked in for my free night at the Niagara Falls' Sheraton Fallsview hotel. I have one more free night pending at the Zuerich Sheraton, and we'll see. The hotel is immaculately clean and well-maintained, albeit pretty dark everywhere, including the rooms, as many have commented before. Every floor has a pool table, although one has to go to the front desk to get the equipment, and I suspect they're mostly for show. Most floors also have \"portraits\" which morph from men to apes or monkeys. I had a reasonable Hollywood Hills view from my room. The rooms are visually striking. There are multiple etched-glass drinking glasses of various colors in the room, as well as full-sized bottles of multiple soaps (body, face, hand, etc.). While some people commented on getting sprayed on when turning on the shower, it is actually possible to direct the flow to the opposite wall. The \"mini-bar\" is actually a full bar with full-sized bottles of fairly premium liquor, such as Patron tequila, and Russian Standard vodka. No prices were marked, and I assumed this to be a case of \"If you have to ask you can't afford it.\" As others have pointed out, the lighting is rather poor, and one of the weaknesses of the room. Another was the hard-cornered metal framing under the mattresses. I bumped my shins on it. I thought I was just being clumsy, perhaps, but my partner did the same thing, so this is one of the instances of \"form over function.\" Another example of \"form over function\" was exemplified by the pools. One of the pools is literally only 1 foot deep (30 cm), and the other 3' 6\" (a bit over a meter). If I were paying over $300/night for a room, I think I'd want a pool one could actually swim in. The gym, on the other hand, is possibly the largest hotel gym I've ever seen, certainly for a hotel of such modest size. The business center, too, is very adequate for the hotel's size. Unlike some hotels which have 2 or 3 terminals, this hotel has a whole array for guests' use. This is one of the most unusual hotel's I've ever stayed in. It's one of the most visually interesting, albeit perhaps not one of the most functional hotels in which I've stayed. I can see why some love it and some hate it.

In the heat. With a small boy. My husband ended up finally getting a young guy to take our order for a drink. And we waited and waited and waited some more. Finally the drinks came, and rather small and stingy they were. Anyway, we ended up waiting for our room until it was almost 5pm by which time we were completely fed up and wondering if we should simply go to another hotel. As we were leaving to finally go to our room, we were presented with a bill for $65 for our drinks. We thought this was a bit rich, and asked for this to be taken off the bill when we checked out 2 days later. If this hotel is going to be so slow in ensuring rooms are ready by a given time, then herd unwitting guests onto the steaming hot pool deck- of course management should show a bit of goodwill and at least offer a couple of complimentary drinks! 2. The rooms are ridiculously dark. 3. The only possible way to get food in this hotel is to order to your room. The restaurant is either fully booked or shut. We tried to get some tapas in the restaurant one afternoon, and were shown to a table. No one came back to take our order. It was absolutely incredible. I've NEVER seen anything as inept as the service in this hotel!! We waited and waited and waited. The waiter didn't return, so we left. Funny thing was, as we left the waiter was hovering about at the door and asked \"Going already?\" (really surprised) and we responded with \"Yes- why would we hang around when you're clearly not going to serve us??\" So stupid, it's almost funny. 4. I really resented the message on every bill I signed for room service\" \"For your convenience we have added an 18% gratuity to your bill\"... or something similiar. Where does this place get off helping themselves to MORE of your hard-earned money??? Then we really didn't want to tip the staff bringing the food to our room. One guy threw a mini-tantrum and snatched the bill folder from my husband's hand and knocked my coffee over when it became clear he wasn't going to get a tip. I'd like to give this hotel a TIP: TIPS ARE MEANT TO BE GIVEN IN GRATITUDE FOR GOOD, PROFESSIONAL SERVICE. THIS HOTEL DOES NOT OFFER THIS. The few positives about this hotel would be: 1. The linen on the bed is lovely. The beds are extremely comfortable. Mmmmm... I can't actually think of any other positive aspect of this hotel. I have certainly told friends and family to avoid staying here. Go somewhere a bit more traditional. Somewhere that mightn't be as \"cool\" or \"hip\" as this place, but at least you feel as if you're being looked after by people who know what they're doing.", "Date": "August 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cWonderful experience\u201d", "Author": "Jessica46", "ReviewID": "UR37018613", "Content": "Staying at the SLS was the best experience I have had so far with the luxury Starwood hotels.

For the first time this year, that did not happen at this hotel - not a junior suite, basically no upgrade at all for my platinum status (and this was my very special anniversary night with my wife), so I would normally be a bit disappointed with the situation. But, I believe the front desk folks were genuine when they told me they had no upgrade rooms available for this particular night and Peggy promised me a beautiful suite upgrade next time I want to come back (which I will next month). So, as for the hotel... simply amazing. Here are bullet points about the stay: (1) There is something in the air here at this hotel, where you just know you are part of a very special hotel. Hard to describe other than a very positive vibe; (2) The staff is incredibly friendly. Before we dined at Bizarre, Lucas Paya took the time to put together his recommended menu for the evening for us!! And, he picked some dishes we would have never selected and they were incredible - such as traditional and modern olives, the \"Philly Cheesesteak\", the \"hanger steak\" - our favorite dish from the (9) items we ate in all! We did not get to the dish made with cotton candy - we are saving it to come back next month with the kids!! The staff at the pool was super friendly as well - not to mention the room service staff. And, of course, Peggy, who truly felt bad that she could not do any better for us (roon wise) on our special night and told us to speak to her directly before setting up our next visit (can't wait); (3) The restaurant - \"Bizarre\" - I believe one of only 2 restaurants in LA that has received a \"five star\" rating from the LA Times(??) or something like that - and we quickly found out why! If you want an incredible experience in dining - don't miss this restaurant! We ordered (9) items in all and with tax, tip, drinks and all included our bill was under $140 - not cheap, but certainly not expenisve by any \"LA\" measure; (4) The room was clean, great bed, TV that is part of the mirrored wall, large bottles of shampoo, etc., access to nice pool tables on every floor; (5) good location - an easy 1 block walk to the Beverly Center mall, a Mortons right next door, easy access to all the local attractions; (5) Nightlife inside the hotel - WOW. What a \"happening\" bar/lounge. Bottle service at around $300/bottle, special drinks with liquid nitrogen(?), beautiful people - my wife and I commented how much fun we would have had at this bar (20) years ago (LOL).

We wanted a base from which we could reexplore such shopping/dining areas as: the Beverly Center, The Grove/Farmer's Market, Third St., Robertson Blvd., Melrose Ave., La Cienega Blvd., and Beverly Blvd. The choice came down to the SLS and the Sofitel; the new Montage Beverly Hills was enticing but too far west. We opted for the SLS because it is newer, a Starwood Luxury Collection property, nightlife guru Sam Nazarian's first hotel, and home to The Bazaar by Jose Andres, only the second restaurant to ever receive the highest four star rating from the Los Angeles Times (the first, Bastide, is now closed). Monkeys are the SLS's mascots because, a front desk staffer told me, they are \"fun, yet sophisticated\", which is the hotel's aim. Designed by Philippe Starck with typical whimsy, humour and modern style (sometimes at the expense of practicality or function), the hotel also tries to provide a high level of service. For the most part, it succeeds. The staff is young, friendly and largely professional, but certainly less formal than at a Peninsula or Four Seasons. On weekends, there are lots of young partying beautiful guests usurping the pool and restaurant/bar, causing commotion in the hallways and rooms (think HBO's \"Entourage\"), but come Sunday, the place settles down. There are separate entrances to The Bazaar and hotel, which has its own quiet restaurant, Tres. The hotel's lobby lounge is actually outdoors. Typical Starck touches abound--mismatched furniture everywhere, long tall communal tables in the restaurants, mismatched glassware in the rooms, all varieties of chandeliers and huge mirrors. The front desk area is dark. The meeting rooms are named after famous monkeys. A room key is needed to ascend any elevator. Each floor has a pool table with a silver floor lamp shaped like a rifle. Throughout the lobby and restaurant are myriads of shelves filled with books and tchotchkes--a housekeeping nightmare! THE ROOM. I had reserved a veranda room, but the very accommodating receptionist quickly upgraded me to a Signature Suite with terrace when no veranda rooms were available. It was large and so very chic. The terrace rooms all seem to be on the 2nd floor with the terraces exiting onto 3 different garden courtyards. As mentioned in numerous prior reviews, the rooms are dark, with many tinted, almost useless reflective smudgeable surfaces/mirrors (even in the shower)--another housekeeping nightmare--I was compelled to leave a larger than usual tip out of sympathy. The desk lamp looks hand-blown but is insufficient. I'm sure the floor lamp styled like a tree trunk and the lighted makeup mirror in the bath were added in response to guest comments about darkness. The sofas and chairs in the living area were chic but not cushy/comfy/plush. There were several design elements that did not seem durable: the white upholstery was stained, the handles on the heavy mirrored sliding doors to the bath were loose, the leather pulls used to open the unique closet doors were frayed and weakened. The large safe is situated too high. To encourage a festive atmosphere, the minibar is very amusing and complete--large bottles of booze plus interesting mixers, a martini shaker, 2 bins of treats labeled Saints and Sinner. The bed was queen size, low (to fit into the sleek custom headboard/nightstands), not quite Westin Heavenly. The terrace showed evidence of past revelry and lack of maintenance--many cigarette butts on the ground, a cigarette burn in the sofa. The shrubs by the wall were dead (hopefully not from urine), but the bamboo was alive and the potted Meyer lemon trees were bearing fruit. There are W Hotel-like catchphrases all over, some of them \"SLS\", like \"Scribble Little Secrets\" on the pen, \"Society's Latest Scandals\" on the newspaper bag. In the bath, several common items were forsaken for style--no wall towel racks (just 2 stylish hooks), no bars of soap, no soap dish, no luggage rack. There were, however, huge Costco-sized bottles of hand, face and body washes, plus body lotion, shampoo and conditioner. The guest directory will tell you these are green because they are refillable. I asked the housekeeper if people take them like they do the usual mini-sized ones--she said yes, so we did. The shower is slate, mirrored, huge, with a concealed drain. I found the towels a bit small and thin, though they are custom made by D. Porthault for SLS/Starck. We could hear others guests through the bathroom vent. The guest directory makes for a fun read, is titled the \"SLS Illustrated Dictionary of Services\" and includes such listings as \" 'Tight Buns'--see personal fitness training\" and \" 'zzzzz'--see linens, mattress and bedding\". THE RESTAURANTS. Dined Sunday evening at The Bazaar. We had peeked in on Saturday night--the place was teeming with foodies and revelers, the noise deafening. Sunday was much calmer (the NBA finals, which the LA Lakers clinched on this night, probably contributed). All four venues--Rojo, Blanco, Bar Centro and the Patisserie were accessible. There is an outdoor terrace, but it faces the valet drop-off area. Apparently about $22 million was put into The Bazaar alone. I was expecting a molecular gastronomy experience along the lines of Alinea or Moto in Chicago, where a meal is a 3-5 hour, sometimes solemn affair. But The Bazaar is different--tapas (traditional and modern) with some molecular gastronomy elements like liquid nitrogen, trompe l'oeil presentations, specific instructions on how to eat a particular dish correctly. Very theatrical and playful, but serious and delicious. And fast--we were done with the tasting menu, presented in \"waves\" rather than one dish at a time, in under 2 hours. I was a bit disappointed that the tasting menu was simply dishes off the regular menu yet cost a bit more than if ordered a la carte. The food is much better than it has to be--this place would be popular even without the foodies and four star review, and it meshes so well in atmosphere with the hotel. Apparently, there is a \"fine dining\" restaurant within the restaurant (it is mentioned on the website) that serves a set tasting menu 3 nights a week. There is an outpost of Moss, the great New York Soho design store, here. Hotel guests also apparently have special access to Nazarian's other restaurants/clubs/lounges. The other restaurant, Tres, is a quiet retreat, never crowded. The menu was quite similar to the room service menu, with some prices identical as well. Tried the continental breakfast buffet one morning and it was fine, included cheeses, chacuterie and aguas frescas. THE POOL. Located on the 6th floor. Reminiscent of the pool at the Starck-designed Mondrian Hotel. Quite See and Be Seen on the weekend, with the pools, one no more that a foot deep, secondary to the cabanas, lounge chairs/beds, and restaurant, named Altitude. The fitness center on the 2nd floor is large and well -equipped. Did not try the adjacent spa. The business center charges for internet use. Overall a fun, relaxing stay. We were able to walk or bike to all target areas, with the Grove being the furthest (1.2 miles) away. It doesn't seem too business oriented (except probably show business), nor too kid friendly. It is a decent value, especially compared to the luxury hotels in Beverly Hills proper (SLS is one block away from BH), though perhaps not quite as pampering an experience. Would definitely stay here again, and in fact plan to do so. Kudos to management for reading TA reviews and responding to each individually.

My company picked this hotel for us all due to 'connection' but I'm finding it REALLY hard to relax here. This trip, I'm in LA for TWO weeks and this Hotel is not doing it for me. I would have checked out by now but unfortunately the rest of my group arrive in a couple of days and they have pre-booked this place also, so i'll stay and try to get into this 'vibe' ;-) Currently, i am here alone but in a few days friends (with their kids) arrive! I was booked to have a Signature suite but upon arrival i was told the room did not have a bathtub (I'm a water babe and need the tub to relax!) so i'm down graded to studio suite This room is almost HALF the size of Sig Suite ;-( and being here for a two week stay i was hoping to have 'some space' (i previously stayed in a deluxe room for one night, hence knowing to book a larger room this stay. i wish their website gave room size/ lay out) It was slightly irritating that just two days prior to my arrival i was told it wasn't a problem having a big tub suite, that maybe I'd have to move rooms for one or two nights, which i said i agreed to, yet upon my arrival, i was told the ONLY suite with a bath tub was now booked the whole time i was here! aaaahhhhhhhhh! anyway, as i'm here, i decided to write my own little 'review' as i'm always utilizing 'trip advisor' and want to give something back. please NOTE, what i have written in this column is a 'how i personally feel' not a reflection on the Hotel chain terms+conditions ; this place is not kid friendly nor practical (watch this space, i'll let you know how the kids get on here once they arrive!).... but here is an 'honest' review from me of the experience so far- fyi P.S. stands for Philippe Starck, the Hotel designer. i have tried to be positive for every negative statement made (just the kinda girl i am he he ). 1, no bath in 98% of rooms (it's ok, if yr only here for a night but any longer and can be a pain!) 1a, beautiful designer large bath tub - if u can get it! (only a handful in the rooms in Hotel, and then, only in rooms with two twin beds, not KING bed rooms....)If you do manage to secure one, it's heavenly.... 2, in the standard shower cubicles (not rooms with bath!) shower has one angled head which is so high up that yr hair gets wet ALWAYS regardless if you wanted to wash yr hair or not! Also have to walk and stand IN shower to turn it on (getting splashed in cold water until it heats up) Bring shower cap as not supplied! 2a, shower cubicles HUGE -could put a bath in here hint hint ha ha ;-) or get up to mischief in this space he he 3, safe is on TOP shelf in wardrobe, so you need a chair to access it (unless yr a basketball player!) 3a, safe big enough to put a laptop 4, wardrobes so small that if you stay any longer than 3 days yr screwed 4a, pretty pictures on wardrobe doors (VERY signature P.S. design) 5, no drawers to stash underwear etc! 5a, nice shelves with martini makers and drinks cabinet 6a, hangers in wardrobe are beautiful but HUGE, more than 5 and no more room for clothes! 7, restaurant ALWAYS fully booked in hotel (even as in-house guest i cant get a table till 10pm+ and that's a booking for a Thursday night- trying to book for 3 days in advance!) so unless you pre-booked weeks in advance, go find somewhere else to eat. 7a, Bazar restaurant really nice, try getting a booking MAKE IN ADVANCE or hang out for a drink at the 'be seen' bar instead ;-) or have afternoon tea here at the chocolate counter, VERY yummy! I actually really like this concept, though i worry the kids will knock over the statues etc surrounding the place inside - even i got conscience of knocking anything! 8, hotel rooms are VERY dark! (EVERYONE complains about this) they have had to give me extra standing lamps just to do work on my laptop. it's also quite a challenge putting on makeup, not sure if i'm looking like a Vegas Show girl going out ;-) 8a, upside to this is it's romantic (?) 9, paper thin walls. i could hear my neighbor unzipping their suitcase and talking in the morning 9a, guess the upside is security can hear anything and help if need be ....(i heard them walking around and talking on their walkie talkie last night) 10, not enough 'table top' area in room or bathroom to put laptop, mobile phone etc (let alone make up, wash bag etc etc ) 10a, the Starckness makes the room appear bigger ;-) 11, teething problems with 'housekeeping' so far both days i left the note on bed and towels on floor to be changed, yet i was given the same linens just folded ;-( 11a, they really are trying very hard to improve and welcome the call to fix the issues. 12, personally, i like a coffee / tea maker in my rooom, there isnt one here 12a, as i had some issues upon check-in, the very very sweet man at the front of house, who showed me to my room, brought a coffee maker to my room for my personal use *this i'm most grateful for* 13, my simple breakfast order arrived wrong. I ordered green tea with soy milk on the side, got Earl gray tea with regular milk (and the hot water smelt of coffee.....word to mgmt, use different pots for tea and coffee pls!) 14, the pool is not a 'swimming pool' but 'be seen' dipping pool. i'm just a little to self conscience i guess. 14a, upside, it is VERY beautifully designed and modern. great views on a clear day as it's on the roof top. i also, enjoy eating at the restaurant by it, grabbing a simple sandwich. 15, concierge are a little all over the place. messages never get followed up if the person is not around i.e. if you asked one member of staff to book something, then ONLY liaise with THAT member as it seems to get 'lost' in the system. (heavy tipping still doesnt help!) 15a, ......eh, they look cute at their door table. Actually, Casey (one of the staff) was very sweet and gave our group a complimentary drink while we waited for him to make a restaurant booking for us *Bazar was full so we had to go elswwhere, admittedly, it was a Friday night last minute booking after all* 16, the spa - it was FREEZING! which made me quite tense and i caught a slight chill from it ;-( the 'wet room' faces the waiting room so you hear people coming in and out constantly (the jingle of their locker keys and hum of conversation) 16a, even with all that, i had a truly awesome experience and would definately go back (even as an outside guest!) the girl doing the treatment was exceptional, she put heat packs to warm me up and did a fantastic job of the treatment. It was over and above service expected. i highly recommend this! i have to say overall STAFF is the greatest thing about this whole Hotel experience! *well done!* They are All very attentative are SO very sweet and are really really trying hard to be accommodating (one guy in particular is worth his weight in gold as a staff member here! always smiling and going above and beyond the call of duty, trying to rectify things and make the guests experience an enjoyable one! thank you!!!! *sorry if i seemed to have been snappy at you*) In all honesty, it's just the way the hotel has been designed it's not user friendly. nice to look at, not so nice to stay at! Philippe Starck should stick to make his beautifuly pretty pieces of furniture and other items and leave room / interior design to others (unless he has LOADS of space to put his beautiful designs, as unfortunately, they dont seem to work on a practical, every day level) ahhhhhh.... i HAVE to try liking this hotel (i am SO trying to be *cool & Hip* ha ha, i must, i must, but not sure i'd stay here again if my trip is any longer than 3 days (unless i manage to secure a bathtub Signature suite!!) hope this review helps you make up your own mind? happy travelling!", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cNovelty vs. Quality\u201d", "Author": "JACAtlanta", "ReviewID": "UR30839344", "Content": "While the SLS hotel is striking in it's design, it isn't always functional.

Pool area really looks attractive, but it doesn't work well - no shade, unless you buy a Cabana, which don't come with sun lounging chairs. Also no shade in the Cafe by the pool which is very odd - particularly when it was 95F. We took breakfast in the lobby area one morning - strangest buffet breakfast ever. They put three of everything on the counter...three croissant, three glasses of fruit salad, three parfait's and a plate with a few bits of ham on it - very weird. Once a couple of guests have been to the buffet, there is nothing left on the counter and they were very slow at replenishing it. Looks lovely, but just doesn't work. The next day we had breakfast in the room, which was fine apart from the fact that the coffee came in a couple of French Presses, that leaked and the coffee was cold. Overall the staff were a bunch of young kids, who were generally disinterested. Not the professional hotel staff you would expect at a top quality hotel and not in the same league as the staff and service of the Four Seasons. They also charged us for parking each day, which was supposed to be free to 'sls founder members' ! We moved to the Peninsula, where the service was immaculate and the room rate lower.", "Date": "April 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, tX", "Title": "\u201cSwanky, Lavish, Society - with Funky Vanity Reflections\u201d", "Author": "BJBDallas_tX", "ReviewID": "UR28454492", "Content": "Very subdued lighting and disorienting with all the reflections of self and others because of the mirrors.

Very quickly... I planned a shopping adventure for my wife's Birthday and The SLS was currently running an ad campaign mentioning how they were raising the bar to the luxury experience so I chose to stay there, plus one of our favorite chefs worked at SLS. I made the call, talked to the Front desk and Concierge and they both assured me we'd have a special room with a welcome birthday gift. We arrived in the early evening to find ourselves in a line of 12 cars waiting for valet (thanks to the hotel night club). The Night went this way: 1. No assistance with our luggage until after I personally grabbed a luggage cart. 2. After walking into the room I noticed no gift, no birthday wish, and we got a room that must have been the cheapest in the hotel even though I paid $400. 3. The TV in the Room didn't work, had audio with no video. 4. The shower (stupid design) drain was clogged preventing us from even using it. 5. The sink leaked all over the floor every time you used it. 6. The SPA was closed. 7. The biggest problem of all was the level of customer service. I called the Front desk manager to get assistance with all the problems above starting that night. I called 3 times and zero solutions were offered including moving our room. It took 3 days and a treat to write a review like this before I heard from the Hotel GM via email finally someone who cared about us. In summary, I paid $400 for a birthday that was the worst! No Valet service, no Champagne, no Shower, No TV, No SPA, and NO SERVICE at this hotel could be found. The Rooms look like the much less expensive A-Loft Hotel ($89 per room).

Although the hotel has very cool \"visual\" features: unique design, funky bar/restaurant attached, it is NOT a good hotel for an extended stay and certainly not for a business traveler. PROS: - I am a former LA resident, and it's decently located where the old LeMeridien was, walking distance to Bev Center, Sushi Roku, Morton's, and Matsuhisha. - Pool and pool bar is very nice - Fitness center is nice (although a couple of times they were out of cups for water!!) - The decor is \"cool\" in the same way a Grammercy Park Hotel is, whimsical design in lobby and rooms - Rooms are decently size CONS: -VERY VERY inconsistent service, if you are a frequent traveler, you will really notice that the SLS does not have strong service, examples: sometime calls would not be answered at front desk for up to 20 rings, newspaper was delivered to my door 6 times out of my 10 days (what happened the other 4 times???), Valet service was inconsistent, sometimes they were very quick, other times extremely slow when seemingly no one was out front, Bill had numerous incorrect charges: including double valet charges ($32/day), and Minifridge charges (Never even opened it once). - Restaurant/Bar: as a guest, it was very difficult to just go get a quick bite or even drink, the scene was absurd. Very very crowded with the LA set every night. - Maid service: 2 times out of my 10 nights I received no maid service - Noise: lots of partyers stay at this hotel. Could hear hallway noise, and loud slams (2am ish). This happened on 3 separate nights. - General Upkeep: little things like the funky TV monitors that decorate the elevator lobbies. These were working only 50% of the time, and when they were out you'd see a CPU screensaver \"reboot\" type screen showing. These types of mishaps just don't happen at good hotels, even a newer high end Marriott is much much more consistent.
