But this hotel is in desperate need of upgrades - at the very least. There are changes in the area with Amazon expanding its campus right up to the lake and the recently constructed apartment houses behind putting this hotel in harm's way. I honestly don't know if the structure can survive as a hotel, but time will tell. Whether it's this consideration or not, the decor here is extremely depressing - dark carpeting, dark and aging furniture, very uncomfortable mattresses. The room was clean, the wifi free and good, and again, the service was notable. But this is Seattle, dark and grey most of the time as it is. The property needs to be decorated with color and light. It's also mere steps away from a corner of Lake Union, with some of the rooms overlooking the Lake - this gives an opportunity to bring a brighter theme to the hotel, updating and freshening the accommodations as well as providing a generally more uplifting environment. We had meetings on-site, and while the meeting room was spacious, it also was difficult to keep cool and hear people speaking as the air conditioning is noisy. The service was also a little off timing, morning coffee service showed up about 10 minutes before the morning break service, which showed up around 10 minutes before lunch! Otherwise, the room was well equipped technically, we had ample power for 30+ technogeeks, projection screen, whiteboard and solid wifi. Good luck to this property, the people were great, the location unstable, the property in need of desperate upgrades but the pressures do seem largely external and if it is as I suspect, the decision to not upgrade the property until the area stabilizes or doesn't, it isn't wise business to spend a lot of money for the upgrade.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful stay\u201d", "Author": "bellakitsy", "ReviewID": "UR116130238", "Content": "My husband and I had a wedding in Seattle and stayed at the Courtyard Marriott/Lake Union.

We recently used this hotel to accommodate guests for our wedding at the adjacent Virginia V (which was incredible). While they didn't drop the ball entirely, they definitely left some things to be desired. First off, coordinating our wedding block proved to be more difficult than we would have imagined, though for this we blame Marriott more than this specific location. The planners for wedding blocks seem to be located at corporate headquarters and as a result it was often difficult to get consistent information regarding our local block. When we tried to get info from this location we were always told that they couldn't do anything and we needed to contact the above mentioned planners. We arranged for our guests to receive gift bags we had put together as they checked into the hotel. However, as we spoke to our guests we came to find out that a number of them had not received their bags upon arrival. The first room they put us in (again the bride and groom, which they were aware of) had views of the building's ventilation systems and stains on the walls. While they were quick to give us another room, it was kind of disheartening to be given that room in the first place. In addition, a large number of our guests were placed in rooms with equally bad views, which isn't so bad except for the fact that they sell you on the views when you're checking the place out as a possible venue. Finally, on our last night we were hanging out with some friends in our room (about 5 total) around 3AM. We were keeping it fairly quiet, but management came up and knocked on the door. Fair enough, it wasn't early and I can appreciate the situation. However, instead of asking us to keep it down we were told, \"If we have to come up here again we will kick you all out of the hotel.\" It was not the warning but the manner in which it was given that we found offensive. While we understand the issue of noise complaints, we did bring them thousands of dollars of business and a little tact might have been appreciated. Threats don't typically make you feel like a valued customer. Anyway, the purpose of this review was to relay our experience to anyone who might be thinking of using this hotel to accommodate a large number of guests.

They were very accomodating with suggestions, letting us borrow items (tape, scissors) from the front desk, and helping us with meeting room set up. There is no 24 hour room service so that was disappointing. We did eat the breakfast buffet one morning and that was $13.95. Overall, I had a great stay.

Unfortunately, by the time the pull-out was extended, there wasn't much floor space left in what had initially appeared to be a comfortable room. When we checked at Reception about the continental breakfast we were informed there wasn't one but we could purchase a buffet breakfast (forget the cost, but it certainly wasn't cheap).

Not great for my husband who suffers from an arthritic hip after extensive walking. We had to use cabs to get around, an option that added unwelcome costs to our trip. A sister property, Marriott Residence Inn just one block away still has its shuttle service downtown. So does the Silver Cloud Inn, which is also within one block, as well as the University Inn, another affordable alternative to downtown.

I absolutely hated the beds, never have slept in a less comfortable bed in a hotel/motel. I did ask to see if we were in one of the remodeled rooms and the person at the front desk said the remodeling was complete so I guess these are the new beds. They are very soft and you fall off and wake up with back pain. It's really too bad because we thought the whole staff was exceptionally friendly and pleasant. From our waiter at the buffet in the morning to our shuttle driver, everyone was so accomodating. Enjoyed the breakfast quite a bit. The free shuttle was handy as well. Pool and hot tub were decent and enjoyable. Thought that the internet access was pretty good. Free wi-fi, $10.00 for 24hours web tv or a business pc located downstairs that you could rent. There wasn't a mini-bar or minifridge but there was a very clever little store located in the lobby. They sold toiletries and drinks and snacks, all sorts of things, better prices than most minibars and a much better selection. The best part is it's open 24 hours a day, which is nice because there aren't any real stores that are close. Pay-per-view movie selection seemed better than most and not too expensive. I definitely had a fun time, I just didn't sleep well.", "Date": "June 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cExcellent all around\u201d", "Author": "grad_girl_1", "ReviewID": "UR3518602", "Content": "Stayed for 4 days over Memorial Day weekend, and thought the hotel was terrific in many ways: 1. They have a free shuttle to downtown areas, such as Pike's Market. It runs every 30 minutes, was always on time, and it was a great service. 2. Rooms were great...somebody in 2004 wrote a review saying the rooms were drab. This was not at all the case when we were there. I heard that the hotel was recently remodelled, so this might explain it. 3. The common areas of the hotel are very nice, too. Great equipment in the fitness room, a nice, roomy lobby with free apples and coffee in the morning, cookies in the afternoon. 4. Staff was responsive and friendly. 5. Free internet access in rooms.

The hotel is undergoing refurbishment which did not disturb me at all during the stay. I was given a newly refurbished room, on the top floor, overlooking the lake. The room was very clean and had a big desk and chair, a storage chest as well as a wardrobe and also a sofa and coffee table. The bed was extremely comfortable (brand new) and I also appreciated the complimentary TV guide in the room (useful for when watching TV during the night - thanks to the jetlag!). The bathroom was small but again new and clean with a bath and shower attachment with good water pressure and a WC. The washbasin was actually outside the bathroom in a small vanity unit opposite the wardrobe (the dressing area as I referred to it!) and also had a coffee making machine. Room cleaning was thorough and items I sent to be laundered were returned promptly and neatly pressed. There is also a laundry room on the first floor of the hotel with wachine machine and tumble dryer facilities. The hotel has an adequate (if a little sweaty) gym on the 1st floor and also a swimming pool and jacuzzi on the ground floor. I found time to try out the gym but unfortunately not the pool! The hotel has a restaurant which is open for breakfast - a good buffet selection (hot food and waffles as well as a cold selection), and then serves room service/bar menu in the evenings. I ordered room service one night and the food was adequate although a little cold, and we had food in the bar one night which was fine although nothing special. The bar is dark but comfortable and has an adjoining sofa area next to a fire which is very nice. All staff I encountered were friendly and polite, especially Michael on reception who ensured that my colleague and I received the nicest rooms possible after our long journey. There is a small shop next to reception selling souvenirs, sweets, crisps, drinks, paper and books. Free coffee (starbucks) is also available with paper cups in reception every morning, and cookies in reception in the evenings (very soft, chewy and yummy!) The hotel also offers a free shuttle service to 5 locations in Seattle which is fantastic! Space Needle is a 20 minute walk away but I would recommend a taxi or the shuttle as it is not an easy walk and involves crossing madly busy highways!! The only downsides would be (in my opinion) the location in terms of what's around - there wasn't an obvious supermarket or store nearby and although there were a number of restaurants within walking distance they were on the whole more pricey - so a diner or deli would have been perfect - obviously this is not the fault of the hotel! The hotel is a pleasant 30 minute walk from Fremont which is a lovely quaint area full of nice shops and restaurants - I particularly recommend PCC wholefoods which has a fab selection of hot and cold foods as well as groceries and drinks, and baja fresh for fresh,, healthy mexican foods. For teas and coffees, Peet's would be my recommendation! I would certainly stay here again and would recommend this hotel as a mid-range hotel suitable for families or business travellers.", "Date": "March 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cBed was disappointing\u201d", "Author": "terrilee", "ReviewID": "UR2155623", "Content": "The hotel was attractive and the staff was professional and friendly when I was there.
