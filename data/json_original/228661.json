Fortunately, the weather was mild. It was very annoying to spend 16 euro a day for internet. The buffet breakfast was adequate, but for 15+ euro, that's a joke. However, breakfast options in that part of town seem rather limited. There is a Starbucks across the street, so if coffee and a bun are enough for you, that may be a better way to go.

The hotel is situated in a great location, 5 mins walk from Bernabeu Metro stop and 15 mins walk from Nuevos Ministerios, where there is Metro with 3 handy routes and Cercanias (short distance train). Here, in Nuevos Ministerios station, there is a direct Metro route to Barajas Airport (route 8 to all Terminals) so you can get to the airport from the hotel in less than 1 hour for just \u20ac2. The hotel is really close to Avenida Brasil, an area where you can enjoy the spanish night life. I lived in Madrid for 4 years and this street is a bit noisy at weekends but we got a bedroom in the other side of the building and it's really quiet in case you are worried about noise. Also you can find a lot of Tapas bars and nice restaurants around. The bedroom was really nice, big enough with a huge bed. The bathroom was completely new with all mod cons and really clean, altough the bath wasn't really big in case you are thinking to have a bath instead of a shower. It wasn't too noisy as it was in the other side of the building. We didn't use internet but I assume that this should work fine, if not staff were really helpful an polite in any queries we had. After the check out they offered us to keep our luggage and also advised us to use the PC and printer in the entrance of the hotel. That was really handy as we could print our flight tickets with no problems and quickly before heading to the airport. Housekeeping staff did a professional job also. We paid \u20ac90 per night that is a really good price for the quality provided.

Spain's not famed for high levels of service in hotels. The Orense doesn't have particularly good levels of service either, but for Spain it's quite acceptable. I stay here regularly as it happens to be very near an office I visit each month. The rooms are exceptionally nice, large, clean and modern. The hotel is on a corner block, and there is a significantly lower level of noise for the rooms at the rear of the hotel than those on the front and side. There's no view to speak of in any direction, so you're not missing out on anything asking for a rear room. Someone's commented on the street noise being particularly loud if the windows are open. The heating can be pretty extreme in winter, and it's quite likely you'll find the windows have been left slightly open by the previous occupant who couldn't work out the heating controls. So if the room does seem noisy, check that the windows really are sealed. You probably shouldn't ever order room service when you're in a city with great restaurants like Madrid, but it's nice to have the option if you're jet-lagged. The Orense doesn't have room service, but they do a deal with a local pizza place who deliver to your door and the amount goes straight to your hotel bill. The pizzas aren't too bad either. But if you have the energy, get a life and walk 2 minutes out the door. Try Tapelia, up the road, it's a chain restaurant concept but very good quality rice and paella-style dishes from Asturias. And finally, the location. This is located in the business district of Madrid. Yes, if you're going to the football stadium to watch Real Madrid, very handy. But if you're in Madrid for tourism, well, I don't think I'd be staying here so far from the action.
