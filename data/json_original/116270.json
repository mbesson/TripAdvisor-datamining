Actually, I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected that is was so far from the center of the city. We had rent a car and it took us about half an hour till French quarter. The hotel is an old one and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2* and this is it.

The personnel were extremely friendly and helpful. For example, in the restaurant we have ordered black tea one evening and although it was not in the menu, they have brought it for us free of charge! We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eaten in the hotel restaurant, but the food looked nice. We tried cheesecake and pecan pie- they were very tasty and cost only 4$. Those cheesecakes from the Cheese Cake bistro in Garden District were much worser and too sweet and cost 10$. In the city you have to look for a parking very carefully- they are all so expensive on the Mississippi river. But two-three block far from French quarter you could find one for 7-11$ per 10 hours.

As many of the other reviews tell you, this hotel is out of the way, \"out in the east\" off Interstate 10. There were few choices as I reserved in March and anything closer to downtown or the French Quarter was booked up or prohibitively expensive. For Jazz Fest, book in January they tell me and your options are many. From the Avalon it's a $30 round trip cab ride to the French Quarter and a $100 round trip cab ride to the N.O. Int'l Airport. If you're part of a tour group or in town for a convention and have arranged your own group transportation, booking the Avalon may save you a few dollars. Otherwise, for a single person like me meeting friends daily either at Jazz Fest or in the Quarter, getting around basically ate up whatever money I had saved staying there. And forget about renting a car; parking is slim to none downtown and in the French Quarter and quite expensive. The major factor in my booking the Avalon was that I was told the hotel offered a shuttle to and from Jazz Fest and even to and from the Quarter (for $20 round trip or $27 to Jazz Fest, to French Quarter and back to the hotel). This shuttle ONLY ran for the three days of Jazz Fest (Fri, Sat & Sun) so I was forced to take a cab for the days before and after Jazz Fest when I wanted to go and explore downtown or meet my friends for dinner, etc in the French Quarter. NOTE ABOUT THIS SHUTTLE....the pickup and dropoff point in the Quarter was at THE CHEVRON GAS STATION on Basin Street, four blocks from Bourbon Street and eight blocks from Jackson Brewery, Cafe du Monde and the heart of the Quarter. The prospect of walking all the way back across the Quarter back to a gas station to await pickup is not convenient and I wouldn't call it safe either. Part of the reason for this arrangement is that this shuttle service is privately owned, with a limited number of vans and drivers, serving about five hotels around the city. Call for pickup and you wait, sometimes up to an hour or more. Despite the inconvenience, the drivers were very friendly and informative. One driver even offered up a cool tip on grabbing some of the best home cooked soul food in New Orleans right outside Jazz Fest (at \"Momma's House\" - thanks Marlin!). For $8 I got a loaded take out container and never ate better. A note about the hotel. Built in 1972, it looks and feels every bit its age. That is to say it's clean and functional, but lacks modern amenities,especially in-room internet access (there is a business center on the 7th floor with two PCs and on-again, off again connectivity and the printer does not work), My king bed was VERY comfortable, a saving grace. In the shower it was impossible to get a constant temperature. It was like chasing your tail trying to get the temp *just* right, only to step in and moments later get practically scalded or cold-showered. It reminded me of how my mom used to make me and my brothers take shorter showers as kids by yelling \"time's up\" before turning on the hot water in the kitchen, giving us the the cold boot. But I digress. I complained to hotel personnel and they suggested I shower earlier or later. Obviously a problem throughout the hotel. I can't imagine how the retirees who just rolled in off the tour bus were going to feel tomorrow morning. I'll be back to New Orleans next year, hopefully for both weekends of Jazz Fest. There are so many other things left to do!

They didnt clean or left new towels. Called the front desk and they said they were going to check what happened. Only 2 elevators for 8 floors, and having so much ppl in the hotel, made it an adventure to get to the lobby on time for the small continental breakfast area. Overall, i wouldnt stay here again. The hotel is located in an area still under renovation after hurricane katrina, so it looks desolated and feels like a ghost town.

The hotel is well located for highway access to the city; however there is a lot of rebuilding in the area. There was ample free parking, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know quite what to expect, as there was a guard posted at the entrance to the lot. Since there is a lot of construction in the area, many of the workers stay in the hotel. The web site boasts that the hotel is newly renovated, but that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be the case for our room. Although it was clean enough, it smelled very musty. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if other rooms smell musty or if it was just ours; since we were only staying for one night, we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be bothered to ask for a different room. The furnishings were adequate but the television reception wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great. The bathroom could have been cleaner but wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly dirty, either. The towels were rather threadbare and flimsy, and the hot water wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very hot. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about scalding ourselves. Continental breakfast included a few varieties of cereal, some bland cinnamon rolls, toast and juice. The coffee was a chicory blend, so we passed on that. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the pool but it looked okay, some people were swimming. Note that if credit card billing is an issue, the amount is billed prior to checkout so if you want to pay by an alternate method, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too late. When I checked in, I had stated that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to pay with that card, but they charged it anyway. Upon check out, the clerk apologized and offered to reverse the charge. The hotel wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t terrible by any means but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d probably stay in town if we visited the area again.", "Date": "April 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "dannyboyIndianapolis", "ReviewID": "UR14813919", "Content": "We stayed here 3 nights in late March. We didn't expect perfection given the price but the bare bones breakfast, the many cleanliness issues and the lack of basic repairs (that didn't appear to have anything to do with Katrina damage) left us very disappointed .

Instead of replacing it, it was rolled up and stuffed in the chair. When I took the blanket down to the desk I was promised that it would be replaced that night if possible but at least by the following day. The following day the bed was simply made up again without a blanket and as an added bonus we were left no wash clothes. Upon our departure I filled out the guest comment card making note of our disappointment at these issues. Upon returning home I got a letter from the managing partner stating \"be assured that we will communicate your appreciation to our entire staff. \" I'm not sure if that was meant to be sarcastic or if I simply got the standard form letter.

What a wonderful experience we had during our short visit. We arrived at 11pm and found the hotel to be beautifully decorated and well maintained. Even though the front desk was very busy they were efficient and friendly. We were checked in and on our way to our room in no time. Our room was a special treat, it too was well decorated and perfectly kept. The big king bed was very comfortable, the pillows were soft and fluffy, and the air conditioning worked wonders. We slept like a king and a queen in a palace. The next morning my wake up call came right on time and we were up and getting ready to start our day. We did not have time to swim but this hotel does have a nice big swimming pool out back along with plenty of free parking. As we headed out the lobby to go to our car a very friendly lady approached us. She identified herself as Cindy, not the tropical storm, but the General Manager.
