I won\u2019t overstate what has already been said about this hotel: small room (where my large feet seemed to smash into every angle it offered), small bathroom, uncomfortable beds and a noisy hall (before I dispatched them, some charming guests were acting out a threesome on the carpet near our door.) Although front desk staff seemed indifferent to our arrival (and likewise our departure), I did find caf\u00e9 staff and bellhops (does one say that now?) very friendly. The buffet breakfast was a great deal, and the manager of the caf\u00e9 was very attentive, and kept me awash in coffee. Similarly, the staff who checked our luggage were extremely helpful, and we left our bags to stroll the city, knowing that they were in good hands. The location was great, and I didn\u2019t find the streets dodgy. Would I return?

Room is small, no doubt, but it is sufficient to place even my 32 kg business class suit case on the other bed. No closet space if my memory serves me right. I was allocated a high floor corner room with a spectacular of Race Course and the city.The bed is comfortable just like any Best Western hotel brand, shower head is powerful. I do think having a bath mat would be great. Internet speed is good and additional bottled water and ironing board and transformer were delivered prompty even at 10pm. The down size is that it has no porter service. Life is small but it serves its function. Service is good. Staff explains everything in great details in their best capacity.

Surrounded with quite a lot of eateries (\u8336\u9910\u5ef3). Downside is that the hotel might not be easily spotted if you have not been around this part of Causeway Bay. Simple way to identity: once come out from Exit A of Causeway Bay, walk directly across to the other end of Times Square. You should be passing by Levi's and Rolex shop which will be on your right. Go under the flyover and you'll see More & More Cafeteria (\u591a\u591a\u9910\u5ef3). Turn left and walk all the way down to the end. You will pass by DCH Foods and some shops selling Chinese praying stuff (joss sticks, statues of Buddha & etc). There you will see a sign that will direct you to Best Western hotel. Stayed at guest room #2102. There is a cafe located at Level 6 but I didn't get to try coz good food is everywhere in Hong Kong. Also I saw on their hotel info TV channel that they have a Jacuzzi at the top floor but then again I didn't try as 1) didn't bring any swimming costume, 2) it was raining on Day 3 & 4 of my trip. Toilet amenities - Basic supplies. But maybe 1 thing to suggest to the hotel: to install toilet roll holder in the guest room toilet. Toilet paper was left at the shelf under the basin and I have to reach to get it. It was not a far reach but then again I don't think anyone would like the idea of having toilet paper left on the shelf. Room size is just nice for a single traveler. If family size wise, I guess they do have bigger rooms accommodated to that. Housekeeping attendant is friendly and she did a great job for the room. Laundry service - Available in hotel but I didn't use. Just outside the hotel there's a couple laundry shops and its all within the same block of the hotel or near.

Hey you are on Hong Kong island, hopefully if you are there, you are not spending a ton of time in your hotel except for sleeping purposes!", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "penang", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "travelkid88", "ReviewID": "UR118807233", "Content": "One of the best bed ever slept in Hongkong, thou rather small (twin size bed) but fit the purpose for a good nite sleep. Room is small, very small to the extend it is just like the size of your third bedroom plus a toilet (no longbath only standing shower). Entrance is thru a backlane and check in on the 3rd floor (don worry as there is a Porter on the ground floor to guide you up). Location was superb and for those looking for cheap mean of transport, jump on the tramp which is 200m away and if heading to Kowloon, jump off the tramp at Wanchai ferry terminal and catch a Star ferry to Kowloon (Service cease at midnite or when typhoon signal 8 is declared) The only drawback is we check in very late at 9.30pm and our request for 1pm checkout the followind day was turned down by a squating lady supervisor!! She dare not stand to answer us and just shook her head ignoring our plight. No name mention but her hair is short. Overall will suggest you stay there for a sleep and don expect anything else...", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cgreat staff clean hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Ilonafox", "ReviewID": "UR118493811", "Content": "I have been last week in Hong Kong and we stay in Best Western Hotel and we are happy.The room was small but i didnt go there to seat in hotel ,few hours sleep that was enough .To beautiful city to spend a lot of time in hotel.Anyway Hotel was clean and nice looking inside Best Western Hotel have so nice staff ,cultivated ,friendship,helpful ,lovely people!!!Very good service!

There was no more space in the room than to fit a small queen bed. I kid you not. There could've been perhaps 1.5 ft of space on one side of the bed when we pushed it all the way to the wall. There was no way for a wheelchair user to fit beside the bed. No way to reach the coffee service (stuck in a tiny nook underneath the window beyond the bed). No way to turn around. True, the bathroom was quite spacious - in fact, it was probably larger in area than the rest of the cubicle. When we asked for a larger room, we were told there were none (as in none existed - ours was supposed to be the largest room in the hotel). Considering the fact that the price wasn't exactly low, I was very disappointed. The hotel will do well for an able-bodied person, but don't expect to hang out in the room. Also, the bathroom may've been large, but the plumbing was awful. Badly done, dirty and it actually got in the way when you wanted to use the (miniscule) wash basin. The rooms have air-con, but the hallways do not.

We were allocated a twin-bed room because all the double-bed rooms were full, although the staff did promise that we would be able to swap into a double-bed room for the following 2 nights. There was a distinctive stale cigarette smell on entering the small room, and a used tissue left on the floor (albeit just under one of the beds, only discovered because we pushed the twin beds together). Moved to a double-bed room as promised the next night which also smelt of stale cigarette smoke (this is only remarkable because both of the floors we stayed on were both meant to be non-smoking). Overall impression was average, but given we chose this hotel over others we've stayed at in Hong Kong (Ibis North Point and Harbourview Hong Kong) because it was cheaper, I think we got what we paid for. Other points of interest: The decor reminded us of a karaoke bar (faux chandeliers, black tiled walls and a gilded frame around the LCD TV); The ground floor entrance is effectively through a driveway - you have to go up a couple of floors in the lift to get to the actual lobby; The room size is pretty much equivalent to those in Ibis North Point but Best Western does have the advantage of having 3 lifts rather than only 1 and a more convenient location for shopping and eating in Causeway Bay compared to North Point; The surrounding markets are great if you're into that sort of thing but be prepared to walk through crowds and dubious puddles to get to Times Square and Causeway Bay shopping; There's free wireless internet (ask at reception for the password); and There are 2 laundries conveniently located around the corner, one being a 24 hour self-service.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bentonville, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cNot worth it\u201d", "Author": "dgirl72712", "ReviewID": "UR115735931", "Content": "The young man at check in was very pleasant but the upgrade we were promised during our email reservation process never happened.
