If you do luck out and get a parking space at the hotel the only ways to get in and out of the parking lot exits are raised up so be prepared to bottom out each time you come and go. We upgraded our room from a horrible mildew/cat urine smelling room to one that just smelled like mildew.

I stayed previously at the princess royale but we were on a tight budget this trip and decided to stay at ocean voyager- even though it was still around 180 per night, it was still less than princess royale. When you walk into the room you are blasted by the horrible stench of mildew, walk through the room and the curtains have blood stains on them, the bed spreads ripped, small dirty refrigerator, MOLDYYYYYY shower curtain and hair stuck in the towels. The air conditioner was full of dust and makes awful sounds when turned on. The street and other patrons were the least of our worries. Please understand that I have seen some pretty nasty motels before but I went two weeks ago and now, i have \"tunnel\" marks from scabies on my arm. I have not yet verified from my doctor that this is indeed scabies but i am almost 100% sure based on pictures ive seen of them. The cleanliness in this motel was farrrrrr below expectations and although it seems to be a party motel and high school seniors tend to stay there, it is disgusting for even the lowest of low lives i am sure! If you want diseases or bugs, go to ocean voyager. If you want a clean, nice place, opt for paying a little extra and staying somewhere like princess royale which is up a bit further or paying a lot more and staying somewhere between 2-20 sts.

A) We weren't even in our room during the times he's referring to B) I'm not sure what that has to do with the air conditioner being broken the next day.

I guess that is why I have so many complaints. There was constant noise from the bar below our room and the traffic right outside our door. I requested to have my room moved and the night jerk, I mean clerk, refused and said I had to \"understand his position,\" meaning he wasn't willing to do any work and did not understand the concept of customer service.

It was closed for repairs on our stay.

My boyfriend and I are from New Jersey. We booked our two night stay at the Ocean Voyager in hopes for a nice relaxing short get-a-way. 2. Excited about our vacation, we arrive early. Check in is not until 3:00pm, in order to give the staff ample time to \"clean\". (Please note, the work CLEAN is in quotes). We pay for our two night stay while there. 3. We come back at 3 to check in. We are given the key to our room. Now, we know that we have not spent $500 a night to stay at the Hilton, but for $120 a night, we've spent enough. 4. We walk in to our room. The smell of MOLD is so incredibly pungent, it immediately hits us, and we both look at each other with disgust. We walk back down to the office to request a room change. 5. After stating the simple fact of the room we were given was absolutely being overrun by toxic mold, we were given the key to another room. 6. We enter our second room.... faint smell of mold, but nothing like the first room. We agree to stay. My boyfriend and I go out to the beach, come back to the room. We decide to get ready and then go out for dinner. He showers first. While I am laying on the bed, I begin to get severely congested. I have allergies, but, did not realize that one can be super allergic to MOLD. 7. He exits the bathroom, and tells me that the shower is absolutely FILTHY, and the shower curtain is covered in 3 MONTHS WORTH OF MOLD. At this point, thinking that maybe the steam from the hot shower might help my congestion, I enter the shower. 8. I exit the shower, get my camera, and take pictures of this BEYOND DISCUSTING shower curtain. No wonder I'm totally congested, I've checked into the BATES MOTEL. 9. While I get dressed my boyfriend goes downstairs to complain about the cleanliness and requests to speak with the manager. 10. Go figure the manager \"doesn't have a set schedule, and wont be in tonight\". 11. The very unhelpful kid at the desk finally aggress to come to the room to look at the shower curtain. He too, disgusted at the fact that the establishment which he works could possibly charge anyone a penny to stay in a toxic mold filled room, takes the curtain with him, and says it will be changed. 12. At this point, we are turned off, I can't breathe, and need to leave the room. 13. We take all of our stuff out of the room, put it in the car, and start our search for a new hotel to stay during our vacation. 14. The Ocean Voyage agrees to refund our money for the next nights stay, even though there is a GIGANTIC sign on the wall that reads NO REFUNDS. (Yes, while even I am blonde, this should have been our first tip-off to the kind of quality this establishment is offering.... why the need for the GIGANTIC NO REFUNDS sign?) 15. Thankfully we did end up ealking down the street to the Executive Motel, and met the most wonderful woman in the world - - Miss Jeannie - - This woman is so wonderful, she makes Mother Teresa look slightly awkward... I mean put her in your pocket and carry you around everywhere adorable! Congested, and dejected, she looks at us and before we can even say a word she says, \"Ocean Voyager? We get them all the time.\" She proceeds to tell us horror stories which include the likes of mold, and mice poop in beds.... 16. We rent a room from Miss Jeannie. 17. The next day we go back to the Ocean Voyager to explain that we couldn't even bring ourselves to stay in the room one night and we'd like a refund for night #1 as well. We are told, by the same, unhelpful kid at the desk that the manager will be in somewhere between \"10 and 12\". Nice schedule huh? Wonder what this guys gets paid.... 18. We finally meet up with the manager. Judging by the gold chain around his neck, hes not just in the hotel business. 19. After explaining our case, very diplomatically, we are refused our money back. 20. We then tell him that we are going to contact our lawyer, present our case, including the pictures of mold, and wanted his name, and the name of his partner. 21. He takes a Ocean Voyager pamphlet off the table, turns it over, writes \"SAL .... JOE\" on the back, and slides it towards us, as if we were agreeing upon ransom. After looking at the pamphlet my boyfriend states, \"SAL AND JOE? THATS IT, NO LAST NAMES?\" Sal responds, \"NOPE, NO LAST NAMES.\" 22. CLASSY. 23.

It was quite negative as far as the hotel itself went. We returned this year and got the same room (we asked for it and hoped there would be no new surprises). But, we were pleasantly surprised that the room was fresh and had no funky smell and all of the bedding was fresh and recently laundered. The bathroom was old, but very clean. The shower curtain was new. Towels were changed daily, trash emptied and bathroom supplies re-supplied each day. Extra towels or other items were available for the asking from polite, accommodating, tolerant and friendly staff that were on site way into the early hours every night monitoring the nightlife and taking care of customers. OK, the facility itself is old--it's about as old as I am, so it's not all sparkly new and fancy like the towering (big-time name brand hotel) across the street. But, it was funny that, for the 5 days that we were there, the fancy hotel's windows were filled with people watching the fun that was abundent across the street at our motel. Maybe they were laughing at us...who knows? Who cares? I'll take the Ocean Voyager again any day. If it's quiet and fancy comfort with lots of ammenities that you want, or a place where the kids can crawl all over the carpet, go rent a vacation house in the woods. Heck, go to the (big-time name brand hotel)! If it's a business conference that you are attending, get a fancy place where you can hook up your laptop and work. This place is a get away--a place to just have fun and relax. It's not a place where you hang in your room all day. The staff here are nice, hard-working friendly people that are trying to provide clean, budget oriented lodging for those people who are in OC to enjoy themselves and relax. I sure would rather spend money on fun and sightseeing and shopping than the place where I sleep. Come with an open mind, enjoy the Tiki bar, the beach and ocean, the incredible deli across the street at Anthony's, the wonderful Pirate's Den breakfast restaurant and the crystal clean pool. If you're a worry freak, and it makes you more comfortable, bring your own sheets and pillows. I even brought an air freshener in case it was needed (it was not). We do, but we do this whenever we travel. Oh, like one review said, the TV doesn't have a remote. Get over it! Who watches TV on vacation anyway? We'll be back. BTW, the hotel was sold out for bike weekend, so it's not all that bad. We book early in the winter for this week in September.

The floors and carpet were disgusting,bed covers looked okay on top but when you rolled the bed down they were all stained underneath. The floors and carpet were so bad I did not want to go barefoot. I took all my own cleaning products thinking that I would have a nice clean place to stay. I thought I would have maid service for 110.00 dollars a night to vacume and change beds, the maid never arrived. We left the room because we could not stand the smell and did not sleep all night because the room they put us in was facing ocean hyw.,the cars and motorcycles were extremly loud all night long.
