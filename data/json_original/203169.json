The hotel Villa Pinciana which I'd booked initially turned out to have some repairs just on the day I came so they sent me to the Sistina - taking into account that I'd written to the hotel in advance, informing I was going to come, it didn't characterise the Leonardi chain in a good way. Anyway, it's not about the Sistina Hotel. The first room I had was really unpleasant: it was gloomy and the a/c unit was placed in the position so that it blew into my ear - no difference where I tried to lie on their (really good, though) double bed. In the morning I asked for another room and got it. So my mark is distributed between these two rooms: the first has got \"zero\", the second (for 4 more nights) the rest of the four points. What is really great about the Sistina is its LOCATION: just in Via Sistina connecting Piazza Barberini (with the underground station) and Trinita dei Monti. So in 5 minutes you can reach perhaps the most romantic point in Rome - the top of the Spanish Steps. Splendid! The ROOM (my second one) was good enough, with a nice bed, efficient a/c (in the right place this time!), a safe, a mini-bar and a spacious bathroom. Two things were not so pleasant but I'm sure the hotel can take care of that: the smell coming from the bathroom was terrible: smoke! I don't smoke and hate this smell, so my deodorant turned out to be helpful at that point. Another thing - there are some little details in the room - some carving on the door, pictures - all these objects could be cleaner if you ask me. But in general I was happy in this room. BREAKFAST was good with quite a wide choice. The STAFF were friendly - and I'm really thankful to the signore who changed the room for me. After all, I paid for a single, but ended up in a double. In general, I think this hotel has a good potential: the main aim is to pay more attention to cleaning and destroying this horrible smell of smoke. And - sorry - it's my personal opinion, but I'd remove pictures of Madonna which hang above beds. Italy has got so many great artists with their Madonnas - much better to look at reproductions of masterpieces than at these doll-like faces... Anyway, four out of my 5 nights here were really good and the price I paid was quite reasonable for the centre of Rome.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "alabama", "Title": "\u201cGreat location - great hotel\u201d", "Author": "maggie909", "ReviewID": "UR115174301", "Content": "Hotel was very centrally located -- 2-3 minute walk to Spanish Steps, one block away from Barberini metro station.

The hotel itself is OK if you only going to use it as a base. It's quite small, and although it's faux marble decor has charm, it needs a bit of a facelift. Our room was pretty standard, with air-conditioning, a safe for personal belongings, and a spacious bathroom. Several of the reviews here say the hotel is smelly-we had no experience of any smells so cannot agree with this. The soundproofing was pretty good, considering that Rome is just about the noisiest city on earth. Parking? This is Rome-are you crazy? No chance! Breakfast is standard continental fare, and exactly what we expected - tea, coffee, cooked meats and cheeses, cereal, croissants, juices and fruit. You can return to the buffet as many times as you want. If you're expecting a cooked breakfast go to Blackpool instead. There is a tiny roof garden where you can have breakfast served, but this information is not volunteered, you have to ask (and pay for the privilege, probably). There is no tea or coffee facility in the rooms either- this is a disappointment, and much needed after a hot day slogging around Rome. You can get room service to bring you hot drinks in the room, but this will be added to your bill. There is no restaurant for an evening meal but there are several within yards of the hotel, so it's not a problem. The staff were generally very courteous, especially if you made the effort to speak a few basic words of Italian. Their English isn't great - but why should it be? They're italians in their own country. A couple of tips about Rome in general: 1) Rome is not at all pushchair or wheelchair friendly. The footpaths are very narrow and bumpy, with no ramps to assist crossing the roads. Traffic is completely mental and you need to be careful. Most of the roads are cobbled and have cracks and potholes. There are lots of italians standing around chatting in groups on the streets-don't expect them to get out of your way-they won't. 2) Don't waste your money on bottled water. Buy one small bottle then top it up regularly from the waterspouts that are all over the city. The water is fresh, clean and palatable-and free!

The first room I was offered was rather a cave than a room. After complaining at the desk I got a reasonable but also not four-star-worth room (very small room and bed, outworn mattress). The next three days we had a double room, which was also on a basic three-star level. We can confirm that the desk is friendly on an Italian basis. However, the management is not able to cope with matters of course (water was coming from the ceiling, there was a problem in the room above us and they were not able to clean our bathroom, which was floated). However, we got a deduction for the last night. The location is good, shopping area and Spanish Steps are very close. In the rooms you almost hear no traffic (which is rather seldom in Rome), but due to thin walls you have the plaesure to hear your neighbour fart.", "Date": "May 31, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Leonardi Sistina Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d203169-Reviews-Leonardi_Sistina_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$115 - $276*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Sistina 136</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Piazza di Spagna</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00187</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "203169", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/2e/c0/2ec0c05cc1805851a6a4271fa283d8283large.jpg"}}
