In this sense, looks like a hideaway. While my stay, I went back to the hotel by taxi four times, but three drivers didn't know. Only one driver said \"yes, small but comfortable\". If it were not the absolute term to be a major district of Berlin, I think Carolinenhof will be impeccable. But never inconvenient. Only three stations arrival from Zoologischer Garten (DB) by U-Bahn. Two stations for Kurf\u00fcrstendamm, will be able to find various restaurant. The location is obvious residential district, but I think really like a blind spot. The last time when I stayed for the first time, I understood well friendlinesses of receptionists, economy whereas quality. This time I stayed in a room with balcony facing to the courtyard. I thought the courtyard is not mere yard, in spite of inner large city, woods were luxuriant freshly, I woke up with warble of birds like singing. It was the only regret that I didn't ask what kind of bird. I felt living atmosphere rather than staying in a hotel. Everywhere metropolis, I have a headache for finding hotel, usually expensive, having trouble to narrow down information cause of too many accommodations. It is not easy to find out a hotel with high satisfaction balancing with price, besides such kind hotels are often difficult to get reservation. Hotel Carolinenhof is a member of VCH (Association of Christian-run Hotels), I rely upon the association. When I worried about not being able to secure a hotel, or couldn't narrow down choice of favorite, they useally give me a solution.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "pfcfan", "ReviewID": "UR5824662", "Content": "We booked to stay in this hotel during the world cup when hotel prices seemed quite high. This hotel was reasonable and although at first we thought we were some way from the actual city centre (it was our first visit to Berlin) we walked back from the main shopping street the first night and it was only 20 minutes walk. After that we did not use the subway much, it was much easier and more interesting to use our street map to get around on foot. We walked back pretty late some nights and never felt threatened. Having said that there is a metro station just 5 minutes walk from the hotel. The receptionist was excellent he really went out of his way to help us, not just answering questions but greeting us with information he thought we might be interested in. There was no financial motivation it just seemed to a genuine desire to help us and also show off a city he was obviously proud of. The room was more of an apartment with a kitchenette attached. In fact the building seemed more like apartments than a hotel but the room was definitely up to 3 star standard with a good sized bathroom and extremely clean. No complaints about the room and a quiet location with no traffic noise at all. Breakfast was a cold buffet but there was the option to eat outside in the garden which was pleasant. If we went back to Berlin we would use this hotel again.", "Date": "September 20, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Carolinenhof", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d199434-Reviews-Hotel_Carolinenhof-Berlin.html", "Price": "$54 - $112*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Landhausstr 10</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10717</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> (Formerly Hotel-Garni &quot;Haus der Begegnung Berlin-Wilmersdorf&quot;)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "199434", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e8/06/35/hoteleingang-carolinenhof.jpg"}}
