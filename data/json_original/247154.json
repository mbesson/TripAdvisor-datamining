This hotel was on the list of selected hotels to be used by buyers attending the Home & Housewares show, and I have stayed in Comfort Inns before, so I felt comfortable booking here. The hotel is a convenient walk to several restaurants, grocery, a Starbucks right across the street, and Bloomingdales, Nordstrums, plus several specialty stores. It was very clean and newly decorated, and I felt comfortable being a woman alone in the big city. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Now for the down side: Right next door, and in fact, adjacent to the Comfort Inn is the Tokyo Hotel. If you want a bad dream, just read Wikipedia's take on this hotel. I never saw anyone go in or out of this building, so I don't know for sure what goes on there. When I stepped into the room on the 10th floor, there was a red glow in the room, coming from the bathroom. Upon further inspection, I found a huge glowing red lipstick print on the mirror which can't be turned off. The floor is a wood laminate, the bedding is stark white, there is a huge wall hanging above the bed with a giant handprint on it, and the wall connecting the room and bathroom is covered with a giant zipper. The room can only be described as \"urban ghetto\". I showed the pictures to friends I took of the room, and they suggested I rent it out by the hour while I was away, and advised that if I did so, to be sure and de louse it. I normally love traveling alone for a few days, but just hours after I arrived, I was so homesick I started to cry, and tried how to fit 3 days worth of business into 1 day so I could leave that room. It was very cold and unfriendly and I did not feel welcome.

It wasn't like we were staying in our room a lot other than to sleep and shower. It was cozy for 2 but there was a closet, luggage rack, bench and chairs to put our things on. The bathroom was nice with a very nice shower head and water pressure. The bed was comfy and so were the pillows. We stayed on the 10th floor and could hear the city traffic but it wasn't a big deal. We didn't hear our neighbors. We used the spa, which was nice! It was a larger hot tub on the lowest level and was very relaxing after a long day. The breakfast was good. The people working there were working their butts off to keep things restocked. Lots of breads/bagels/danish, yogurt, waffles, fruit, juices, eggs, sausage, cereal, milk, coffee/tea/hot cocoa and oatmeal. The eating area is tiny and many people had to sit on couches. Not very many tables but we didn't mind and still had a place to sit. We loved being just blocks from Michigan Avenue and famous restaurants like Lou Malnati's, Pizzaria Uno, Hard Rock Cafe, Rock n' Roll McDonald's, Ed Debevic's and Gino's East. Lots of selection.

Wish they didn't use flourescent lights in the bath, could be a bit brighter but was adequate. Room had a safe, microwave, small frig, good size tv, free coffee with coffee maker, large closet, wifi, hardwire hookup, good a/c, quiet, nice mattress. Room was clean! Breakfast was great! As the good word is spread the crowd gets bigger and seating was usually full but folks ate and left so others may sit. The manager says that renovation is coming soon and by early-summer 2012 that should help the seating. But the food choices were abundant and plenty of it. Two staff were working hard to make everyone happy plus keeping the food areas clean. Just awesome! Thanks gals! Bottom line - we'll be back and I'll recommend this property to my clients. Try a Segway tour from Absolutely Chicago Segway. Great people plus a fun, informative and lengthy tour for a good price. Company color is orange so look for the orange shirts.

PARKING: Parking goes as follows: first you park your car with the emergency lights on in the street in front of the hotel. run in to check in, the gal will give you a little plastic case with a built in sensor to place on the dash of your car. the sensor automatically opens the gate to the parking garage. the public parking garage, that has 3 different entrances around the block. one is about 20 feet from the hotel doorway on Ohio St., or one around the block on Wabash Ave., and one on Grand Ave. (doesnt matter which you enter with).

I was combining business with pleasure which meant that part of the trip was on expense account and part on my personal dime. I have had difficulty in the past with hotels splitting reservations and not uncommonly have had to change rooms. This did not happen here. I was able to make two separate reservations, called the hotel in advance and they prepared separate paperwork while keeping me in the same room. When I arrived early on the first day, the front desk staff reviewed my reservation, put my luggage in storage and provided precise directions to my business meeting. The WiFi in the lobby was down but two employees dropped what they were doing and reset the router in a matter of minutes so I could check my email. Throughout my stay, all of the staff went out of their way to be helpful and responsive. Two negatives, one minor and one major. The room included a work table and two padded chairs designed more for watching TV than working at a desk. A straight back work chair would have been more useful since the arms of the padded chairs would not fit under the desk. More importantly, there was some sort of construction going on behind the hotel and trucks were going in and out all night (except Friday/Saturday). This was a real problem when the trucks went into reverse and put on their back-up horns at 3:00 am. I mentioned this to the front desk and suggested they install noise dampening curtains until the construction was finished. When I return, and I will but when Chicago is not quite so cold, I will ask for a room away from the back and probably raise my rating of the sleep quality. Location could not be better.

In my opinion, the hotel itself is a pretty standard 3 star property in terms of rooms, services, etc. However, given its excellent River North location and the fact I got a room for $100/night, I'm giving it 4 stars for overall value. Room - We were in a basic room on the 7th floor. The room was very small but manageable for two people for 5 nights. Our room only had a window into a very narrow alleyway looking out at a wall about 3 feet away. The queen bed was comfortable. There wasn't much storage space in the room, but after unpacking and placing our suitcases on top of the TV/entertainment unit, there was enough room for us to move around. Shower water pressure was good and the bathroom was a good size. Overall, the room furnishings were a little dated, but the room was clean and served its purpose. Location - Absolutely perfect for our trip. The hotel is located a 1 block walk away from the Grand El station on the red line which was perfect for getting to/from most of the sights we wanted to see. Travelling in from O'Hare on the El blue line was about 1 hour. The hotel is very close to excellent restaurants, bars and shopping. There is a grocery store across the street which came in handy for picking up snacks/drinks. I wouldn't even consider staying in another downtown Chicago area if/when I come back. Service - It was efficient but lacked any friendliness or personality. On our way out the first evening, we let the front desk know there was no TV remote in our room. When we returned after dinner, they had placed one in our room. Breakfast - It is included in the room rate and feautres pretty standard fare (bagels, toast, cereal, some muffins, juices, coffee, yogurt, apples/bananas, waffles). It was a good quick way to start the day. They use disposable plates/utensils so you can pick up some food and take it back to your room if you want.

The room is smallish but equipped with non-wireless free internet and free local calls, the bed is comfy with lots of pillows and the bathroom was modern, clean and had a good shower.

There are a number of good restaurants within a block or two and the red line CTA is only a block which is why I chose this spot for ease of transport to O'hare.

The location of this hotel is amazing, everything you would want to see including all the main attractions, food, shopping are right at your finger tips. We only got a cab twice and that was beacuse it was raining. Restaurants that are close by that you have to dine at are #1 Texas de Brazil( one of the coolest restaurants I ever ate at) unlimited meat!! #2 PF Changs ( really good) and Portillos is good too. There is a liquor store attaced to the hotel and there is ATM Machine inside there. I suggest using a banks atm machine to be on the safe side. Water tower is amazing for shopping and so is Felines basement (all designer stuff extreamely discounted). The hotel also has small gym with sauna and whirlpool (good way to relax after long day of walking). ok the continental breakfast is the best i ever seen. Every fruit/cereal/pastry/bagel you can imagine, make your own waffle station, bolied eggs and english muffins, every juice/milk. Perfect to start your day, we never bought breakfast once in Chicago!! Tip get the \"Go Airport Express\" shuttel to the hotel from Midway airport. Get the return trip, its way cheaper then a cab, approx $30.00 return versus a cab that can be $75.00 each way in traffic hour.

The shower worked really well, we had complimentary newspapers and the coffee making facilities were easy to use (although biscuits might have been nice)! The biggest benefit to us as a couple was free wi-fi, which enabled us to hold video conversations with our kids in England over the webcam. Saved a fortune in mobile phone charges! Breakfast was great. Lots of choice and plenty of it. The only downside for me was that the breakfast area was extremely small and you struggled to get a table, as the hotel was full of marathon runners all wanting to eat at the same time! The staff had no problem with you removing food to your room if you chose to do so. They even arranged for the hours to be altered on marathon day to cater for those who had to eat by 6am. I hope the staff got a bonus for being up so early! The staff were friendly and professional. No complaints whatsoever about them.

I was particularly happy about the hot water for the shower---plenty of it and definitely hot. They offer a continental breakfast which was more than adequate----especially if you plan on eating all the other foods Chicago has to offer throughout the day. There are bagels, cereal, fruit (a little lacking there), Belgian waffles, pastries and hard boiled eggs. Only downfall is breakfast is over at 9am during the week. Weekends is at 11am. Check in was at 3pm and very easy. Check out is at noon, but for $5 we could stay til 2pm. Our only complaint overall was the Internet service. There was supposed to be service in our room, however there wasn't. I'm assuming it was just a freak thing----just bad timing for us that the rooms were unable to get access. Service was available if you took your laptop to the 2nd floor (lounge area) or 1st floor (lobby). It was a slight inconvenience for us---however we were only using the Internet to search for a few local things and our email. We weren't here on business so it wasn't imperative for us to have access. If you definitely need service in your room for work or whatever, you may want to confirm there really is access always and make sure the outage wasn't just during the days we were here. On a side note, good places to eat: Giordanos for deep dish pizza, Pizano's (Italian---portions are huge--alfredo really good), Quartinos, Jakes (bar nearby---good bar food), Ditka's restaurant next to the Tremont Hotel.", "Date": "July 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place\u201d", "Author": "busyinWilmington", "ReviewID": "UR8240065", "Content": "Hotel was great, walked all over Chicago from our hotel.

The lake and Michigan Avenue are only a few blocks to the right when you exit the hotel. The hotel itself is very nice. Our room was very small, but we didn't mind since we didn't spend a lot of time in it. The bathroom was very clean, as was the entire room. We had only one small window, which looked onto a nearby wall, but again, we just wanted a place to sleep. The breakfast buffet was fantastic for me because there was a waffle maker! My boyfriend was a little disappointed. They offered coffee, juices, several cereals, hard-boiled eggs, pastries, and bagels. And the waffle maker of course, yum! The eating area is a little awkward since it was pretty busy both mornings and set up like a living room with a few tables nearby, but overall not bad. Just a tip, there are only two small elevators and they're pretty slow. If you are checking out near checkout time, are on a lower floor, and have lots of luggage, it might take a while to get an elevator that can fit you in. I saw several people waiting and not able to get in because of this. We flew into O'Hare (on the top 5 list of worst airports nationwide - lots of delays) and took the train/blue line to the Clark stop. It's very easy and only costs $2 per person. If you don't want to walk to the hotel from there, the cab ride is only about $5-10. I hope that helps!

Myself (34) and my parents (66 and 67). We had never done Chicago before, so we just picked a random hotel with a good reputation and went with it! What a lucky random pick! The hotel is about 2 blocks from all the magnificent shopping on the Magnificent Mile, has a ton of restaurants within walking distance, and has the nicest staff I've ever had the fortune to meet! We arrived at O'Hare and took a cab to the property, which ran about $42. They offer shuttle service through continental, but it was only going to save us about $6, so we just did the cab thing. When we arrived I was very ill (motion sickness from a cab ride, a total first for me), and as soon as my dad mentioned it, the bellman actually offered to run to the pharmacy for me if I needed it, and the front desk clerk offered to get me a Sprite from the machine downstairs! All the staff were like that, super friendly and willing to go to any lengths to keep you happy! The rooms are sort of suites. They have a single bathroom in the middle, and to the left is the bedroom (2 double beds, a dresser and a TV) and to the right is a small sitting area with a wet bar, closet, TV, desk and sleeper sofa. My parents took the beds, and I slept on the sleeper sofa. Quite comfy, surprisingly! I closed the bed up every morning, and when I came back at night, the maid had pulled the bed out, changed and remade the bed. That takes some dedication! The room was always spotless when we returned. The continental breakfast is offered daily 'til 10 thru the week and 'til 11 on weekends. Had your standard pastries, muffins, fruit, yogurt, etc. Also had a \"make your own\" belgian waffle station and a chaffing dish full of boiled eggs. Several kinds of fruit juice, milk, water, hot tea, coffee. Small sitting area, but we were always able to have a table. Within walking distance are: Big Bowl (Thai, great homemade ginger ale), California Kitchens Pizza, Weber Grill restaurant, PF Chang. There is a grocery store just around the corner (Jewel Osco), Bloomingdales Home and Design within Reach are across the street. The Grand Train Station is just behind the hotel.

I was placed in a handicap accessible room so I was surprised there wasn't more room around the sides of the bed. The bathroom was very spacious, my only complaint was there was no medicine cabinet or place to put my toiletries. The sink had a big soap dish on one side of the faucet so very little room for even my toothpaste, let alone my other stuff on the other side. The room was extremely quiet and dark at night. The window didn't have a view (just 3 other walls of what appeared to be the rest of the building). The A/C unit was a little loud when it kicked on in the middle of the night. It woke me up scared half to death when it sounded like a jet taking off in my room. I got used to it, but it wasn't the best.

I didn't feel like dealing with it because it was late and I was checking out in the morning, but I'm sure if I called the front desk, they would have helped me out. The continental breakfast in the morning was fantastic. Lots of options to choose from, cereal, bagels, pastries, fresh fruit, yogurt my personal favorite, belgian waffles, and more. Perfect way to start the morning. I wish I could have stayed longer to get more of my stay but I was only in town one day for business. The location of this hotel was really ideal. They are right next door to several great restaurants including Pizzeria Uno (the original, I think) and Pizzeria Due (the second one) as well as Weber Grill and ESPN Zone.

The staff are helpful and friendly but not overly solicitious (which is good in my book), the hotel is nicely decorated in the deco style and the rooms are smallish but easy to maneuver around - bathrooms are perfectly adequate with stocked amenities. I have noticed more and more families are staying here, and the breakfast room is a freak show of children at certain hours of the morning with Cheerios and Bananas all over the place, but on the whole it is a pleasant stay and very nicely situated downtown. This used to be a nice hotel for business and European travelers, but word has gotten out, prices have gone up, and you see many more \"t-shirt and white socks\" tourists with small children. Be forewarned if you mean to check in at 3 pm as it is crawling with tourists needing lots of advice from staff about where to go, what to do, where is the bus, where is the Red Line El (hint: around the corner at State St. to your left past Weber Grill). But hey, its a Comfort Inn, so it is what it is. Still, a good place to stay. Rooms are quiet. Beds could have a better thread count for the sheets considering the price of the room (which are crawling higher even during the slow seasons). My only real complaint is that the front desk staff (during my stay at least) are clueless to their internet service. Above the 3rd floor, the hotel is not wireless, which I would HIGHLY recommend to this hotel. I plugged in my computer and know how to handle settings (disable wireless, use LAN connections, etc.) and the hotel staff kept telling me it was my computer when I knew the problem was their connection (or lack thereof). When I called tech support, they told me the hotel indeed needed to reset their internet server, which no one knew how to do at the hotel, so the \"free internet\" didn't count this last trip. I moved over to the Palmer House for another stay later that week and plugged right in (they are also not wireless and charge 9.95 per 24 hours) and was immediately on the net. But then that is comparing apples to oranges - the Palmer House has its own I.T. staff. So for what its worth, a good hotel which is changing over to a more touristy spot.", "Date": "June 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester Hills, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cFabulous!\u201d", "Author": "traveljunkee1", "ReviewID": "UR5041740", "Content": "Went for a \"girls' weekend\"; 7 of us stayed at the Comfort Inn.

Climate control worked great, and shower spray was nice and strong. Staff was excellent! Great customer service from everyone we encountered. Excellent continental breakfast (expanded) and coffee and tea available 24 hours a day. PERFECT location. Some of the complaints I read on Tripadvisor about rooms being too small ... our rooms with 2 double beds were quite large. The room with 1 queen bed was certainly smaller ... but I think you get what you pay for. There was some noise because our room was close to a parking structure (car alarms, etc.), but you gotta expect that when you're staying in a big city.

Several breads, donuts, coffee, milk, juices but everything on plastic plates. Very clean. Cons: tiny! And I say that being European. The rooms in this hotel are little cages. Suffocating atmosphere reinforced by the view from our window (see pix). The room hardly fitted me and my suitcase. Noisy! Terribly! The door of our room did not close well-and I mean the door giving to the corridor so we had to wake up the entire night (every night!) from the voices of other people coming in their rooms. Very unpleasant. The Internet did NOT work and noone cared. Basically the front desk staff couldn't care less about the guests. Unfriendliness behaviour which shocked me given how wonderful Chicagoeans are. So if you travel for business, you'd better forget about this hotel or be prepared to have a not working Internet and noone willing to fix the problem.

We made use of the in-room(payable)movies most nights. The hotel is in a good location - walking distance to all areas. We walked from the hotel to the aquarium but it is easier and quicker to take the metro. Walking took about 45 minutes but the metro took 15 mins. Metro is located just around the corner from this hotel. Breakfast is continental - bread, cereal, scones etc..but you can go down and grap what you want and bring it back to your room as the eating area is not very big - only about 5 table and chairs. There is a great food shop across the road, so you can pick up anything you need there, they have a great selection of sushi. On the other side of the road is the Red Lobester Restaurant and a great littel blues club - can't remember the name but it is tiny and they play good music.

It was my first time in Chicago, and we were looking forward to hitting the Thanksgiving sales. After a long and boring flight from the UK, we arrived at the hotel early. However the staff at the front desk managed to find us a room that was ready. We had a slight mix up at check in over the price of the room, but Tim managed to sort it out straight away. We booked a magifecent double, and compared to UK hotels it was huge. It was lovely and clean, warm and welcoming. We had a coffee maker and microwave, (which came in very handy, as we arrived on Thanksgiving and all the restuarants were closed.

Starbucks one one corner, Bed bath and beyond and Jewel Osco on the opposite corner, Walgreens a couple of blocks away.Michigan ave and State street a few minutes walk. Just around the corner is the free Navy Pier trolley stop, and the CTA Red Line. I needed some bus and train information, because I had not taken my laptop I wasn't quite sure how to find the information I needed, the staff were more than happy to print me off some schedules from the PC'S at the front desk.

The location is great! We only stayed one night as we were in Chicago to see a taping of the Oprah Winfrey Show. We got in about 10:30 at night and checked out at 6:40 the next morning so we spent very little time in the room. The room was one queen size bed and the room was not much wider than the bed. I have only seen rooms this tiny in Europe. I tried to book directly through the hotel but they would not take a reservation for only one night. I believe there was a convention or something. Therefore I booked through another website (ratestogo). It was the best deal I could find for the Magnicifient Mile in Chicago for that date. I believe the total came to $108 plus taxes. We parked in the recommended garage at $21 a night. However, you can only leave your car there until 12:00 noon the day of checkout. The guy working behind the counter let us leave our vehicle in the garage until 3 so we could shop a little after the taping and gave a different transponder to get the car out. You have to go outside the hotel to get to the garage. There was a tv in the room with cable but the picture was not even watchable. Since we were only there a few hours, it was not a big issue but was disappointing nonetheless. There is a continental breakfast served each morning starting at 7 am. Since we had to be at Harpo Studios by 7 a.m. (about $10 cab ride including tip from this hotel), I wasn't sure they would have anything set up. The gentleman in charge of breakfast had starting setting it up and my friend, myself and a business traveller were able to grab something to eat (muffins) but the beverages were not yet set out. I had previously stayed at the Raphael in March as it was cheaper but their parking (valet) is more expensive at $38. If I had it to do over again, I would stay at the Raphael, because the valet parking was worth it. The person I travelled with uses a motorized scooter and the valet parking would have been more convenient and the overall price would have been a couple of dollars cheaper. The Comfort Inn is in much better condition. than the Raphael as it has been recently remodeled and is very clean and also has a pool which I did not see. However, we had a much larger room and two double beds at the Raphael which made it more comfortable.", "Date": "November 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended!\u201d", "Author": "goravens", "ReviewID": "UR4043763", "Content": "We stayed for the second time at the Comfort Inn in August 05.

Michigan Avenue and shopping very close. Close to transit service options. Hotel: Excellent. It was very clean, fresh art-deco styling. Parking garage $21/day with transponder to allow in/out access as desired. Room: Excellent. We stayed in a \"magnificent double\". The room had a wet bar, microwave, refrigerator, internet access (not wireless though), safe, coffee maker, iron, nice radio/CD/alarm. It was spacious for a non-suite room. Room for a roll-away bed, which was quite comfortable, not the typical bar-in-the-back style. The double beds were of satisfactory Serta quality. They were generous with their pillows which I found refreshing. The room was very clean and nicely lit. Our room was in the back of the building, which afforded no view at all, but was very quiet and free of street noise and lights. Amenities: Very good. The complimentary continental breakfasts were very nice, food was fresh. Coffee/tea available all the time. Fitness center is onsite, but we did not have time to utilize this. Sauna and whirlpool. No pool. Staff: Excellent. All were very friendly and helpul. They all seemed to smile. Some went out of their way to be of assistance without expecting anything in return. The few times we needed something (roll-away, extra towels, Yellowbook), someone brought them to our room within moments, no wait at all, the fastest service I've seen at any hotel ever. Price: Excellent. It is one of the least expensive options downtown, yet provides accomodations and service that could rival the much more expensive options. Negatives: very few. The air conditioning was weak, but then again it was around 96F every day. No view (but very quiet). A little hard to see the hotel sign from a distance (hotel is on the right side of this one way street). This is not an extravagant hotel, which makes it a very cost effective option. Those desiring a fancy hotel with extensive amenities would be disappointed. The service rivaled even the most expensive hotels I've stayed in.
