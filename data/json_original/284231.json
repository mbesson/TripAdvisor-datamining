The only good point is the location but that is it! Well that and the fact I no longer have to sleep there!! The room decor was so dated, it didn't feel clean and there were marks all over the walls, curtains and bed valance. Mainly burn marks but it just made me itch.This was supposed to be a delux twin. It made travelodge look like a boutique hotel!! From reading the other reviews before I went I would like to know where the friendly staff were because the guy who checked us in wanted to be anywhere else but there. He didnt welcome us, didnt give us any information about the area, hotel, anything! He just shoved us a key and asked us to pay. I wish I had looked at the room before paying as I think I would have just walked out and gone elsewhere. There was a washing machine that was on spin every morning about 8.30 that practically vibrated the room, it was ridiculously noisy! You can hear what everyone is doing in the rooms around you and it looks like the rooms have just been crammed in hickedly pickeldy to ram as many people in as possible. Not what is shown on the website at all!! We did have a room that looked onto the square which was super noisy all night long! That isnt the hotels fault but just a warning in case you would like some sleep. I really dont think this was great value and I will never go back or recommend this hotel to anyone!

If you plan to stay here, be prepared for cramped, claustrophobic, noisy rooms with no amenities, unless you want to pay Hilton prices for a room with a bath. We opened the door to room 30 to be greeted by a bed. Not a big bed, nor a comfortable bed. A bed. We could have cried at the tiny, dirty room. A previous guest had stuck a cheap picture of what looked like Jim Morrison on the back of the door which had been left for some time, nice touch. The walls of the rooms are paper thin as you can hear everything going on in adjoining rooms and further. I saw a couple who had just checked at reception, both crying at the state of their room. Not really what you want after a days travelling. You need some level of mountaineering skills too, to first of all climb the entrance stairs. I've never seen stairs as steep. This can't be good for children and i'd say near impossible for the elderly. And there is no lift either. The corridors were way too narrow and a door going on to the second floor, opens out over another ridiculously steep staircase. So dangerous, especially when carrying luggage. As lovely and peaceful Rembrandt Square is in the day, and it is, it certainly livens up in the evening, through to 5am the next morning. Then at 7.45am, the roadworks start, bottle recycling starts, food deliveries start, etc. When we go again to Amsterdam, we would visit Rembrandt Square in the evening and stop in a quiet hotel away from the square. I'd recommend St. James Gate pub, located directly below the Atlanta Hotel for food. Welcoming staff and busy with a good atmosphere. Food was always good. One to avoid is The Old Bell on the right hand corner of the square. Poor service and very expensive. The Dutch are really friendly and helpful and at no time did we feel intimidated or uneasy, even in the red light district. The only negative here was the noisy, lairy English guys, hammered on weed, trying to do business with working girls. A desperate conversation for both parties. I was amazed at how many immigrants were there sponging off tourists but this seemed to be in the red light district only. Macedonians, Moroccans. You can't miss them. They're your best friend until you ignore them. Seriously, if you're going to Amsterdam, avoid the Atlanta Hotel. Use it as a last resort. There are loads of other hotels around.

Nice boutique hotel with friendly staff, clean rooms and great location. The stairs are Amsterdam-style (i.e. steep) with no elevator though, so not advisable for those who have a lot of difficulty with climbing stairs. The staff helped with carrying the luggage up so that was not a problem. As we booked our room last minute and the hotel was almost booked out, we had to stay in two different room types. The first 3 nights we stayed in a double deluxe room (eventhough we had only booked a standard room) which was a very nice and newly refurbished. The room was spaceous and clean, but a bit noisy (but hey it's in the center of the center so that is to be expected.) Furthermore, it looked as though there was a jaccuzi bath in the room, so we got our hopes up by this pleasant surprise only to find that the hotel only turns them on when a guest has booked and paid for it. Fair enough, we didn't book it and I am sure its not cheap to maintain that if guests haven't paid for it. The second room we stayed in was the double standard room, which was what we had originally booked. This room looked a little dated, but still clean, comfortable and with a bath. The room was in the back of the hotel though and as such not noisy at all, but we preferred the view of the square, so next time will request it again. (I suppose for the very light sleepers a room in the back is probably a better option though.) Lastly, the receptionists have been great at advising us on cool (non touristy) places to go and good places to eat. Very helpful!

It was my first time in Amsterdam, and hadnt a clue where to stay, I just went onto tripadvisor, and looked for affordable accomodation in the city. The Hotel was warm, comfortable, clean, secure rooms, excellently located and brilliant transport links beside it (Tram, Bus, Canal Bus nearby). I was travelling on my own, and good as I am, I still appreciate a well informed staff, and the staff were very helpful, no matter how trivial the query. Rooms and linen were changed daily (nice touch, but not necessary!)The only downside to the Atlanta is accessability - The Atlanta is to coin a phrase, 'the land of stairs' but that is not to detract from the hotel - it is the norm in Amsterdam, and this is an old building, The locals are used to it, so it is normal. It is not suitable for people of reduced mobility. Just putting it out there, it is not a criticism, just being honest and open, in the Amsterdam way! I enjoyed my stay here, be under no illusions, and it will be fine. They serve a continental style breakfast (i.e. no english breakfasts) but that is no matter. The clincher is location - Amsterdam is such an unpretentious, open minded and once you realise everything is located in a circular fashion (the curve of the canals) you will find your bearings, and a lot more besides!!!! fairly quickly. Good luck, and enjoy the trip! lol. TIP: Get the Connexxion Hotel Shuttle Bus (Check their website for times, etc.) from Schipol Airport - it is a direct link to your hotel - and is cheaper than a taxi. The Metro is a bit removed from the Airport, and the Atlanta is a good walk from Centraal Station. You can, however, if you wish, get Tram 9 outside Centraal to Rembrantplein. Buy a 24 Hour ticket (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.50) for unlimited use of the tram network. It is excellent.

We were initially worried as we didn't book a transfer from the airport but after we arrived, it was plain to see that Amsterdam is so organised itself that even the most dipsy of travellers can find their way around. A train straight from ther airport to Amsterdam central station (the stops are called out in nice clear English). Then take tram number 9 to Rembrant square (make sure you leave the central station through the right exit - there are two at opposite ends of the station - if you take the wrong one you'll know soon enough) the tram driver was very kind and didn't charge us because he could see we were hopeless tourists. Each tram stop is lit up on the wall inside the tram and goes out once you've passed it...so get off when Rembrant square (rembranteplein) is the next one to go out. The hotel is straight infront of you when you get off the tram - its big orange letters are very obvious. If you're in a wheelchair then you won't be able to stay here - there are extreemly steep steps going up to the reception area (however this is tghe bature of most buildings in Amsterdam). The staff are very freindly and ask abut your trip whcih is always nice. They give you a big heavy kep which you must hand into them whenever you leave the hotel - the reception is manned all hours so it's not a problem. Always remember the city tax - its only a few euros but worth remembering so you don't get angry when they try to charge you for nothing. Our room was long and thin but plenty of space. A nice comfy double bed with plenty of pillows, A television and a mini fridge with drinks already there that you have to pay for afterwards if you drink them. There is a warbdrobe with a safe - the safe should be free as you simply put your things insise, close it and type in a combination, you then type this combination the next time you want to open it. The bathroom was small - we had a wet room-esque shower (no bath) but clean and with four fresh white towels. Rembrant square is charming and a good base to explore the city. Literally EVERYTHING is just 25 minutes walk away....I walked to the main square and red light district in HEELS!

The main problem came in the smaller room's bathroom when we arrived we were very suprised to find hair all over the bathroom floor and blood on the bathroom wall. I went straight to reception and asked to change rooms. The woman on reception said they didn't have any other rooms to move into, which was strange since the sign at the front of the hotel did not say they were full and the fact we had been offered a choice of rooms to be closer to the other couple minutes earlier. She assured us our room would be cleaned and we went out to enjoy our holliday. When we arrived back that night our room had not been cleaned and the bathroom still had hair all over the floor and blood up the wall. Also this room looked out onto the square and was very noisy until the early hours of the morning.

As we were on the third floor there were four steep (and i do mean steep !) and narrow staircases to get to our room. Our first impressions of the room were that it was small but comfortable, nice decor with celing beams etc. However we quickly realised that our room didnt have a toilet or shower ! At first we were horrifed and were considering going elsewhere but we decided to stick it out for a night and see how we felt in the morning. It turns out that we were stressing over nothing really. Yes we had to leave our room for the toilet/shower but who cares really ? If you are used to hostles you will have no qualms, if you are used to nice hotel then you might be in for a shock.

I was a bit put out by the idea of having to switch rooms but it was well worth it in the end. The management was nice enough to offer us free breakfast both days to compensate us for the hassle but we didn't make use of it. I am still not sure what we paid for since we booked through an online travel agency and there wasn't a distinction between rooms mentioned in our booking. The first room we stayed in the first night was really awful. Very small with only a very small sink in the room--we had to go down the hallway to use the toilet or shower. The sink was so small it was difficult to wash your face in it. The room faced the square (I wasn't aware of what a party location it was) and the windows weren't soundproof. Anyone but a very heavy sleeper would be sure to wake up, especially when rave disco is blaring across the square full force at 4 in the morning). In short it wasn't a good place to spend the night before a marathon and I thought we should have gotten a bit more for what we paid. We also found out when we came back to the hotel that afternoon that our bags had not been moved into our new room as promised and were instead piled up in the kitchen/bag storage room. Glad I had brought a luggage lock. The second night was fine. Upgraded to a deluxe double and it made all the difference. Roomier. Own bathroom. Comfortable bed. The staff at the hotel were quite nice. They were very helpful about bringing my luggage down from the room and then into the street when a running injury barely allowed me to make it down the stairs.

am a travel agent and have stayed in some good hotels, and some amazing hotels, perks of the job which I'm very grateful for and couldn't afford out of my own pocket, but when it comes out of my own pocket I have also stayed at many cheap basic hotels, this is by far the worst ever, location is great yes, but there are many hotels in Amsterdam with equal and better locations, which are so much better value for money, at the time I went, although I booked well in advance I couldn't get any travel industry rates anywhere, just my luck, and my companions wanted to stick to a tight budget so the cheapest we found was the Atlanta, but for what we paid, 87 euros a night, well that was a rip off.....we entered the hotel, had to wait in line at the 2 foot long check in desk while a man was complaining that his room didn't have a toilet or shower in it, they were in the corridor he had now being told, I sniggered behind his back thinking poor man, I'm glad we don't have to suffer that, until I discovered we did have to suffer that... apparently if u read the small print there is a basic room, shower/toilet in corridor, and a standard room, shower/toilet in room, the man made me laugh when he said even in Uganda they have showers in hotel rooms, I've never been there but u get the point, I guess maybe hostels may not have showers/toilets in rooms either, but the Atlanta calls itself a hotel, and based in a major city you'd expect basic facilities such as that in the room as standard, so we check in an they only had 1 room booked, when Id booked 2, no computer to check this on, just a notepad, they eventually said ok well we have another room spare anyway, u then have to pay upfront, when most hotels allow u to pay on departure if u have not already prepaid, they obviously trust noone, then again if I was the check in staff there I wouldnt trust anyone to pay at the end of their stay after experiencing a night in the Atlanta hotel, our rooms were not ready as we checked in early so we were invited to leave our bags in an open kitchen, full of other bags around a table with slices of ham and cheese on, no chef, right I thought, not eating here, no matter how bad munchies I get, it also didn't feel too safe leaving our bags amongst others in this un-supervised room, we left and went out for a bit, came back, checked in, no lift as its a small hotel, up 4 flights of very steep stairs with bags, which is quite tiring when its the 1st time uv been in a hotel with no lift, get to our room, luxury...not, beds on wheels on wooden floor, my cousin stands on bed to look out of tiny window bout 1 foot by 1 foot, bed goes flyin backwards, he goes flat on his face on floor, word of advice: make sure u have insurance if u stay in this hotel, also when u toss an turn in night, or whatever else u may get upto ;) the bed moves with u, the lady at checkin told us although the toilet/shower was in corridor, the room had full wash facilities, this was a very small sink with no plug hole, u can't use it for washing or shaving as u cant fill the sink, so u have to leave the tap running and put ur face down there to splash ur face as required, as u do this u hit ur head on the glass shelf above, which due to the small size of the sink means u cant do more than cup some water in ur hands, bring ur hands out of the sink, throw it over ur face, and then it ends up on the floor, the safe in our room was locked and wouldnt open, the safe in our cousins room was open but wouldnt lock, no box of tissues in the room either, which is pretty standard elsewhere, and u do miss em when u dont have em an have to go to the corridor toilet to get some cheap an nasty toilet roll, onto the toilet review, the toilet room is about the size of a small wardrobe, once ur in u cant move backwards or forwards, they ran out of toilet roll 1 day, it wasnt replaced when we left the next day, we had to find another toilet on another floor and take theirs, onto the shower, again a tiny sink, and a shower head, not attached to the wall, it hangs on a metal clip spraying back against the wall, so u have to take it off and hold it above ur head, and put it down to get shampoo/shower gel, then pick it up again, very annoying, til on the day before we checked out, our mate Reggie from Pittsburgh, who we met on the trip an laughed together bout the hotel, he had a roll of masking tape with him (Don't ask why, maybe he was planning on kidnapping somebody), anyway, he used this masking tape and taped the shower to the wall so that u didnt have to hold it yourself, genius, even tho it looked awful, but then again so did everything else, make sure u read the sign on the back of the door, if u check out upto half an hour late u get charged 50% of an extra nights stay, if you check out later than that u get charged a full extra nights stay, I have never experienced that anywhere, we made sure we were out an hour before check out just to be sure, oh and our rooms werent cleaned once during our 4 nt stay, and no new towels, thats about it, I think iv covered all the bad points, onto the good points.....no sorry can't think of any apart from the location, there are other hotels in Amsterdam, a hell of a lot, that are around the same price, maybe a bit more, maybe cheaper, but are so much better than this joke of a hotel, I have read reviews of people who stayed here in the \"honeymoon\" suite, with a jacuzzi, sounds good but after staying there I can't imagine it being anything special, certainly not somethin Id stay with my new wife in, I think id be divorced as soon as I returned to the UK, and slagged off for taking my new wife to the worst hotel in the world for our honeymoon, anyone who has done this, how could u...I feel sorry

The location is fantastic, couldn't complain. Bars, coffeeshops, restaurants, cinemas all within spitting distance and not too rough at night. I recommend Smokey's Coffeshop opposite, absolutely brilliant. Following others recommendations on here we also ate at the Three Sister's Pub - not fantastic. But the hotel.. We arrived at 11am and check in is at 1pm so we left out suitcases in the 'luggage room'. That's ironic - there is no luggage room, simply a kitchen with the door wide open. I'll mention the stairs now, I didn't think they were dangerous (at least not up to the first floor) but don't even bother if you have difficulty with stairs or a pushchair to carry.. They are very VERY steep. At 1.15pm we came back to check in and were left waiting over half an hour as the room was not ready, with little attempt at courtesy until right at the end when I complained. We had gone for a deluxe double room, the one with the jacuzzi. I thought it was well below par. The jacuzzi is a bath with a jacuzzi setting, and not a big one at that. Only expect hours of fun if you are both well below the average size (I'm a size 8!). Our 'double bed' was too singles pushed together. This I've not got a major problem with as I've experienced it before i hotels in Eurpoe. HOWEVER.. They had not taken the trouble to make up two separate beds, rather attemtped to put a sheet across them both which was not big enough to cover them. We had one blanket on top and both the sheets and blanket looked less clean than they should have. There was no duvet, presumably because they did not have a double. The next day we found the two single duvets on top of the wardrobe and spread one across sideways which gave us a little more warmth on the second night as it was -6! We didn't bother with the breakfast but did catch a glimpse of it, there's a reason why it's cheap. I found the hotel staff civil enough but I wouldn't say welcoming. I was disappointed as I'd researched well and I found many reviews I'd read misleading.

This is a city that does not sleep from Thursday to Monday, and you will likely not see your hotel room until 3 or 4 in the morning.", "Date": "October 12, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Basic stay hotel....\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2580742", "Content": "My partner and I have stayed at this hotel a few times over the last couple of years and have always found it provides an excellent location, clean rooms and good value stay whilst visiting Amsterdam. The breakfast is continental (Bread, Jam, Cheeses etc) but there is a bar/restaurant across the road that serves a lovely english breakfast at a good price if that's what you would prefer. The hotel itself is above a parade of restaurants in a small but lively sqaure. It's a 5 mins walk from Central Amsterdam and a 10-15 min walk from Centraal station. We'd definately stay here again when we go back next. Please note this hotel is NOT suitable for the less mobile as you have to climb a steep flight of stairs to the entrance!", "Date": "September 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cCracking budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "gaynor74", "ReviewID": "UR2291543", "Content": "Stayed at the Hotel in April 2004 with friends. It was great. Great location and each room was decorated differently and all in varying sizes. I had to change rooms whilst I was there as apparently they had problem with plumbing in my room but my new room was just as nice. Very central so there was a bit of noise but it did not keep me awake. An excellent base and would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "July 12, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cReasonable rooms, good location.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1552219", "Content": "If you see a photo of this hotel, my room was at the front, right above the LAT part of the ATLANTA sign. Whilst I had a view over the square, this was not such a good room, what with the pubs and restaurants immediately outside the hotel. Fortunately I d brought earplugs and I'd recommend other visitors do the same, in case you're also given a room with a view !There is also a very steep staircase to get to reception on the first floor.The room itself was actually not bad. It was en-suite with a jacuzi and had all the usual extras including TV and mini-bar. It was clean and the bed was comfortable.However every time you left the hotel you had to leave your key at reception, which wouldn't have been so bad but the staff always seemed so annoyed when you returned to ask for your key. I don't know why they were like that, a smile doesn't cost anything!Overall this isn t a bad hotel, it s a nice central location with most places within easy walking distance. By the way, I m writing this review about a year since I stayed at the hotel.", "Date": "January 14, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Atlanta Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d284231-Reviews-Atlanta_Hotel-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$91 - $231*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Rembrandtplein 8-10</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1017 CV</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "284231", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/8f/d9/8fd905e5470bf2fe5fe1f528d3fbe9f61large.jpg"}}
