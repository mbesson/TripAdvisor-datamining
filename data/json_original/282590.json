I stayed here for 3 nights and have specifically requested a double room and a twin room, however by the time we reached the hotel, the front desk advised us that there were no twin room available for that day as they were fully booked (note that we arrived at 9am). I refuse to check-in and hence given the disabled person room which features twin bed and a large undvided bath room. I found this to be extremely unprofessional given that fact that I booked the hotel over 6 months in advance plus I arrived early in the morning to secure my room choice. Location: The location of this hotel is great, it is on the street where most restaurant opens til late. only across the street from a tram stop and subway station. (Subway Oranien-burger Tor) and only 1 station away from the large interchange station of Friedrich Station. It is also within a 10 mins reach by subway to Hackescher Market. Security: The hotel itself seems to be fine, the front door of the hotel will be locked after mid-night and can only be open with your door card. The hotel is located on a street with a noticeable number of prostitutes, but nothing out of the ordinary could be seen from here, just use basic pre cautions. Services: Service in most part are up to standard. Front desk staffs are helpful and motivated, knowledgeable when questions asked regarding local tourist attraction. The down side was I have to physically went down to the front desk when I call and request for extra toilet paper and a set of fork and knife. Rooms, Hotel Facilities and Dinning: The room I had was spacious cause it was intended for wheelchair user, other rooms are just average in size. The bathroom design is also rather stupid in standard room, only the toilet have a door and could be lock, the bath tab is open and with no separation what so ever with the bed. I wasn't aware that there are any type of Facilities in this hotel, but free-wifi is a plus. However hotel wide free wifi is a bit unstable and have very poor signal strength, it is recommended to bring your own LAN cable to use the free internet in your room. This hotel features no restaurant, however they partnered with the restaurant next door to provide breakfast service but it tasted awful. Cleanliness: The cleaning was up to standard, nothing to be complain about. On par with most 3 stars hotel. Will I recommend it? If you get a good deal, than yes. Overall this isn't a bad hotel, but with the price I paid, I expected much more than I have received.

Our trip was for my husbands birthday and to visit some of the fantastic Christmas markets. The room was nice and spacious. It was good to have some space without feeling like we where falling over each other. The double bed was a little smaller than what we are used to, but then again European beds are sized differently to the uk(think ikea double bed size) no issues with the comfort of the bed. The room had plenty of storage and wardrobe space. The small kitchen area was usefull for making coffee but the lack of pots, plates, cutlery and general cooking utensils made having the kitchen a bit pointless. The bathroom was nice and clean with a good sized bath and a decent shower. Our only dissapointment was the bar was closed during our stay so we never got our 2 free cocktails that where promised at the time of booking. We didn't get the breakfast in a bag so can't comment on that. We just bought some cold meats, bread etc from lidl and made our own. We would get coffee from the little coffee shop next door - great coffee. One of the reasons I choose this hotel was the location. There are loads of bars, cafes and restaurants right outside. It is also a short walk to the Ramones Museum - well worth a visit for music fans (you can walk round the museum with a beer!)

In other words, they couldn't be bothered, which seems to be a personality trait required to work at this hotel. The rooms they assigned to my colleagues were equally bad - one ended up on a sofa bed in a room that was clearly part of a suite but had just been locked off to create an available room, another ended up in a room that seemed to be used as a meeting room and just happened to have an adjoining bedroom.

We weren't disappointed. The hotel is quite funky with floor to ceiling windows and its furnishings, though at breakfast it was clearly popular with all ages and both business men and tourists. It had all you would want for a city break - toiletries, hairdryer, mini bar, tv, wifi in bar. We read reviews and saw mention of noise, so we chose an upper floor. We had a great nights sleep, though we were there tuesday and wednesday night and were not aware of any club's nearby. The downside of the room was that there were no tea and coffee making facilities which was a shame and the tv only had 2 english speaking channels (both news). The breakfast was fine. Bread, yogurt, fruit, cheese, meat, jams, chocolate spread, tea and coffee, fruit juice etc. We were perfectly happy with it. The slight downside though was that it was served in the bar / reception area which was quite small and on both mornings we struggled to get a seat. Reception spoke perfect english and couldn't be more helpful. The security was good, you had to use your key card to ride in the lift. The area is great. Restaurants all around. Tram stop outside and Underground just around the corner. It is perfectly situated for sightseeing with everything in walking distance, though we were exhausted by the end of the day! This hotel would suit all age groups in my opinion. We came in from Schonefeld airport. It is really easy to get to the centre of Berlin from here. Walk out of the front of the airport and ahead and to the left you will see a covered walkway which will take you to the station. Buy a travel card for zones A,B &C. A single ticket is about 2.80 Euros each or a one day card about 6.50 Euros. The train will stop at several stations including Alexanderplatz and Friedrichstrasse. They seemed to run every 20 mins and took about 20 mins. If you get off at Friedrichstrasse and change onto the S2,S25 or S1 it's one stop to Oranienburger Strasse and about a two minute walk to the hotel. A taxi is about 35 Euros and my guide book tells me that there is an airport bus which takes you to Kurfurstenstrasse for around 6.50 Euros.

We expected the sights in Berlin would be very spread out - and wanted close access to the Metro, even though normally we'd walk everywhere. The hotel is literally around the corner from Oranienburger Tor metro stop, and it did prove invaluable. The area itself has lots of bars and restaurants - and to find somewhere good, and not hugely expensive we walked no more than about 10-5 minutes. We had good food at Sophien'eck (German), La Oliva (Italian), Mirchi (Curry), Schwarzwaldstuben (German) and Good Time (Thai). The room was a decent size - well equipped, funky design, large shower area. The only gripe I had was that I found the bed hard and I found it quite uncomfortable. We also had to ask for extra pillows as they were not great. An unexpected surprise was that breakfast is inlcuded in any price paid (we'd assumed we were room only). Now, breakfast wasn't amazing - but as far as we were concerned a bonus extra - and the rolls, cheese, pate, fruit, yoghurt, juice, tea and coffee were all fine. A final point on the 'Berlin Card.' We quibbled as to whether to get this or not - at 34 Euros for 5 days / all zones it wasn't cheap. However, if you are going to use it to get to and from the airport - that covers 5 Euro, you only then need to use the metro/tram/bus 4 times a day to make it worth it. Add in the fact that if you buy the ABC zones one you can get to Potsdam (we'd recommend) and that it gets you discount into various attractions it was worth it.

As a result we booked what was rated by Trip Advisor reviews as a cool place hip and only 62 on the rating scale of places to stay. Well it was in an up and coming neighborhood but the hotel turned out to be a cheesy version of someone trying to mimic the Hotel W concept. They do not pull it off. Because the hotel is in the former East German side of Berlin, I jokingly referred to it must being a former Stasi (secret police) prison converted to a hotel. So here is the rundown of what to expect if you stay there: 1. Lobby area is small rundown and there is a bar to the right of the entrance to get your lousy free coffee and stale rolls in the morning. I wonder if the same former Stasi prison cook is making those \"breakfast included\" breads for the guests? What I found funny is that whatever the paid guests don't eat they leave on a tray by the front desk. We came back one night and those miniature door stops were still there. Maybe it was chastise the guests that they did not finish the morning stack of nasty treats? You know how those Germans are on not wasting food. 2. The rooms are small and the fixtures are dorm room style. The carpet is threadbare and in a hideous dark red. I wonder what those Stasi colors were hiding? A lot of dirt I am sure. 3. The bathroom is very small in a dorm room style and oh do not expect the maid to clean the floor. Our bathroom had body hair and muddy foot prints on the tile for the first three days of our stay. 4. The bedding is most definitely left over from some prison or military camp that was long abandoned. Maybe when the Russians left Berlin in the late 80\u2019s? You could feel every spring in the thin mattress and when you moved the bed moves with you. The only thing good about the room is that the internet worked fine without any problems and that the room was quiet. No shouts or screams of torture :) But I saved the best for last. One afternoon we had returned to our hotel/prison room and the light was on indicating we were in the room. (when you enter the room, you place your key card into the slot to turn on power) It also lights up outside your door to let the staff know you are in the room. While we were fully dressed and working in the room, the maid just opened the door and came in. We were quite startled as she did not say a word, did not knock or apologize. But she came in and changed a pillow cover. She then walked out. We were laughing over it. But seriously what if we were undressed or making whoopee? So in conclusion if you want to be in this up and coming area, want the feel of what to me seemed to be a former secret police prison turned hotel then by all means stay here! Just make sure you do not pay much for the room, expect much from the hotel and you really don't mind if the room is shall we say clean by anyone's standard other than maybe a prison maid or a flop house keeper? But in our case we paid a lot of money and got very little.

And like all other comments it is an excellent hotel in an excellent location. Not far from the local University means that it has a young vibrant population which probably means that it is the most economic place to stay. Unfortunately the loss of value of the UK pound has an effect on how far your money will go. A pint of beer will cost abot 4 to 5 euro and a glass of wine about 4 euro, eating out can also be expensive but there are still places to eat which offer excellent value and serve up fantastic food. Gambrinus across the road from the hotel is probably the only authentic German bar selling quality German cuisine, and that makes it a must visit. If you are lucky enough to get a table a visit at about 7pm should see you get one after that forget it. Also worth a special mention is the Bombay Indian Restaurant next to the theatre on Friedrichstrasse it is probably one of the best Indian meals that I have ever tried and what size portions you will need to be hungry. Imagine visiting Berlin and raving about a curry but I could not write this without meriting it a mention. Belin has plenty places to see and a worthwhile visit is a short 30 min train journey to see the Olympic Stadium which was very historic but in many was very modern. The down side was a visit to Check Point Charlie Museum which was a rip off 12.5 euro entrance fee per person it is poorely presented,disorganised and claustrophoboic just as described in many best book reviews. Many of the museums including this one are entrance free after 16:00 so check before you go. A humbling visit to to the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe and to the nearby Documentation Museum are free of charge but please leave a donation at the exit for the upkeep of the Museum it is the least the memory of the Holocaust deserves. You will exit with a lump in your throat it is depressing but a story that has to be told and remembered. On a lighter note you will love the place and certainly one of the top cities to visit in europe if not the world.", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLooking for the funky side of Berlin? This is it!\u201d", "Author": "Maree-Kevin", "ReviewID": "UR27394651", "Content": "It's 10 years since we were last in Berlin, and I suppose I was a bit worried that the place might have changed beyond all recognition - caught up in the homogeny that seems to be taking over the world. Happily that wasn't the case, and the Arcotel Velvet is living proof of that. We stayed 4 nights. Firstly, the location is fab - literally a 1-minute walk from the Orianienburger Tor U-Bahn station (which is the line that comes from Tegel Airport), and a couple of minutes' walk from the Orianienburger Strasse S-Bahn (only 2 stops from Unter den Linden - ie. the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag). Right outside the door is one of the tram lines and there are buses around the corner on Friedrichstrasse. Orianenburgerstrasse is typical Berlin, and the way I remembered it - cool glass and steel modern buildings cheek-by-jowl with crumbling stone buildings covered in graffiti and often serving as contemporary art spaces. There are fantastic cafes and eateries all along the street - Thai, Italian, Indian (warning: if you want 'proper' Indian food you need to tell your waiter. Otherwise you get bland, spice-bereft, creamy Indian food designed for the German palate). We are vegetarians and all the restaurants had a good selection of vegetarian options - much better than here in the UK. It's about a 30-minute walk to Alexanderplatz and the Fernsehturm, if you don't want to take public transport, and on the way you can explore the fabulous art nouveau courtyards of Hackesche Hoefe. A pleasant discovery was that The Ramones Museum was just up the street and around the corner. I knew about the Museum but it was a real bonus that it was so close to our hotel. The view from some of the rooms at Arcotel Velvet can be disconcerting if you're not expecting it; we had a standard queen room at the back of the hotel, and our windows looked out to - well, there's no other way to put it - a junkyard! But that's all part of the Berlin experience. Our room was funky, modern, comfortable, clean - with nice bed linen and towels etc. The staff are unbelievably nice and although I speak some German they were happy to switch to English when I apologised in German that my language skills were not fabulous, or whenever my partner spoke to them in English. We booked in a couple of hours before check-in and left our luggage. When we returned the bags had already been taken up to our room. I had the best Bloody Mary of my life in the Velvet Lounge (the bar at the main entrance to the hotel), though it was pretty pricey. The buffet breakfast was included in our room rate and was very nice indeed, but we wouldn't have eaten there if we had to pay the \u20ac16 per head price - ouch! There are plenty of places up and down the street where you can get a croissant and coffee, or the typical northern European breakfast of bread, cheese/cold meats and coffee, for \u20ac3-7. The are only two elements that might be seen as negative by some. The first is the fact that there are a couple of nightclubs nearby and Berlin is a late-night kind of place. We are beyond the clubbing age and we were conscious of some music and revelry at various times through the night - but mainly because we are fresh-air people and always sleep with a window open. If you had the window closed I doubt you would be affected... and anyway, that kind of noise sort of fits with Berlin. It was a happy reminder of where we were, and a change of pace of us having lived in the peaceful Surrey countryside for 18 months. The other issue - again, something that simply added 'local colour' for us - is that Oranienburgerstrasse is known for having sex-workers touting for business at night. We were perfectly comfortable passing by - the girls are well-dressed (not lots of flesh on display), look like they're over 18 years old and don't appear to be affected by mind-altering substances. They clearly know their potential customers - we weren't approached and didn't feel in any way intimidated. All in all, we highly recommend the Arcotel Velvet if you're looking for accommodation in the mid-range price bracket, and hoping to see the 'real' Berlin. Great location, funky decor, wonderful staff and we thought it was great value for money.", "Date": "April 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel at a great price, in a great location....\u201d", "Author": "RaspberryTigerUK", "ReviewID": "UR25380976", "Content": "We have just returned from a three night stay at the Arcotel Velvet.

We purchased a 'Welcome Card' for 72 hours for zones A, B & C (purchased at the airport), which we used to get us all over the city and also to take us as far as Potsdam. Our room was cleaned daily and was immaculate. We were placed on the 2nd floor, facing Oraneinburger Strasse, which was great, however I would suggest requesting a room a few floors higher to avoid street noise, especially in the summer when you would possibly want the window open; there are also rather a lot of nightclubs nearby, so could get quite noisy in the middle of the night. Breakast - we pre-booked it for two mornings and by pre-booking it, we saved 6 euros each, which made it worth while, as otherwise it is expensive for what is on offer.

We booked a suite (more of an apartment) on the top floor, which was great value compared to other cities. The suite was spotlessly clean, had 4 rooms with great views and a very comfy bed. We didn't have the breakfast, as we had read it was very expensive, but there was no shortage of places to eat on Oranienburger Strasse, so no problem there. Also, don't get too concerned about the 'Working Girl's', they don't bother anyone (who doesn't want to be). Also, the post atomic looking hippy centre (I can't remember the name sorry), is definatly worth a look. We were initially put off but went in on our last night and realised we'd almost missed out on a bit of gem. Myself and my partner are in our thirties, so were aprehensive about the hotel and area possibly being too young for us. But on the contry, we found it to be a bit of something for everyone. The only bad point I can think of is on occasion the staff, while friendly, were lacking in customer service experience. When we were leaving, we were not informed that our cab had arrived (even though they booked it), eventually the cab driver asked us while sat in reception if we were his customer (luckily my German is good). Also, whenever we went to the bar, the barman was always trying to push us to buy cocktails, when the majority of the time, all we wanted was a beer. But these were very minor gripes compared to the overall experience, which was very enjoyable.

We took breakfast in the hotel each day - no doubt we could have found cheaper options in one of the cafes outside, but we noticed that most of these came with the cold meats and cheese that characterise German breakfasts which we don't eat, so taking advantage of the hotel buffet each morning was a much better option for us. You have the option to help yourself to champagne too if boozing at breakfast is your thing. Our only gripes with the hotel was that we had two small single duvets rather than one large one and the pillows were so flat and tiny that we woke up with sore necks - my husband's remained painful for a week afterwards.

Service was first-rate, room was nice, clean and modern, breakfast buffet outstanding, location ideal. The only things I would comment on that were not 100% positive were: if you opened the window in my room (which was in an easterly direction) you could hear music from a night club down the street, a bit annoying. But being October I didn't have the window open much. The other thing (very minor) was that when you check in, you're provided with two cards: one is a key card, the other you insert into the wall to turn on the power supply of your room. This is very modern and certainly energy-efficient, which I applaud. But we were not told of this when we checked in, and being less than techno-savvy, there were a few annoying minutes when we tried to figure out how the hell to turn on the power! That being said, there are many excellent reasons to stay at the Velvet. The front desk staff was extraordinarily helpful, meeting every need promptly and more. Certainly they provided better service than most. The room was exactly as advertised (no nasty surprises): very clean & well kept, beds comfortable, bathroom facilities very good. We debated whether to take the breakfast buffet, since it was 12 Euros and not included with the room. However, it was entirely worth it, especially if you're hungry. A really first-class breakfast. The location on Oranienburgstrasse is very convenient also. There's an U-Bahn station literally around the corner, and an S-Bahn station about 2 minutes walk. There are also a multitude of restaurants in the neighborhood, just about anything your palate desires. As an aside, Several blocks down is the Yi Spa, where they give an absolutely incredible massage. For those with physical problems or just wanting to relieve some stress, Yi Spa gave me the best massage I have ever had (out of about 500+ I have had). The front desk staff set this up for me.

Despite some of the reviews (particularly with regard to the bathrooms), I said, as others have, 'Screw it, it's Berlin,' and booked a room. Upon arriving, I knew I'd made the right choice -- despite showing up as a backpacker (enormous rucksack, exhausted look, clothes and hair a mess, that lovely train smell), I was greeted as though I was someone's long lost sister and as though my arrival had saved the day. I was checked in instantly, treated with respect and friendliness (not always the case, given my age and the backpack) ('How was the trip?' etc.), and given a room on the fourth floor with a stunning view of the street. I was surprised that I had such a great view since I'd booked via hotels.com. The room was surprisingly spacious -- queen size bed, generous desk, plenty of bathroom space, a chair, and a wardrobe, and I never found myself tripping over things or felt crowded. As a bonus, the bathtub in the room was enormous and quite deep; I took several baths during my stay, as the tub was just that good (and the shower gel provided smells delicious). It was well decked out -- leather trimmings, black and red, plenty of punchy personality -- to the point where I felt a bit too uncool to be staying there. There are a lot of 'little things' that take a bit of getting used to. While the room does have blackout curtains, with floor to ceiling windows that's a bit of an impossibility to begin with, but the curtains are also divided into three panels, meaning there are always a few small gaps through which light comes in. If you are absolutely insistent that there be no light whatsoever, then, yes, you will find that a problem (so bring an eye mask or stay somewhere else). As others have mentioned, the open(ed) bathroom gives more space and dimension to the room, but it could be a bit awkward if you're not on good terms with your roommate. If you're alone, however, it's great, as you can pull back the curtains and have a clear view of the TV while in the tub. Another note: this is not, I'll admit, a family friendly hotel; unless you've discussed the facts of life with your children, the 'male pill' condom pack might be a bit awkward, and it isn't hidden. On the other hand, I can't imagine a more perfect place for a hipster couple to spend a romantic weekend, so take that as you will. The hotel as a definite personality -- young, cool, etc. -- and if that appeals to you, this is the place for you. If you're looking for a quiet, cozy place to retire to after a long day of sightseeing, you might be better off booking somewhere else. But for adults... it's hard to beat. The bar downstairs, while expensive, is fantastic, and the bartender will give good recommendations if you ask (and he's quite funny as well, if you like caustic). The prostitutes are out on the street, yes, but they're completely nonaggressive and harmless; I didn't encounter any drug dealers, so I can't speak to that. Despite being a young woman alone, I didn't feel at all uncomfortable wandering around the streets at 2AM, even while slightly tipsy (and sometimes more than that). The location is excellent -- there's always something going on the moment you step outside (although you don't hear it, thank God, once you're in your room), plenty of restaurants (expensive and not), bars, clubs, stores, etc. As far as internet access is concerned, there's a great cafe with free wireless literally next door to the hotel and an internet cafe near the S-Bahn stop -- you really don't need to get away from the hotel to find what you need. But if you'd like to see more of Berlin, there's a U-Bahn station literally around the corner and an S-Bahn station a two minute walk away. (If coming from the train station: change to the U-Bahn; that exit is closer to the hotel than the S-Bahn and you will see the hotel as soon as you turn onto the street.) The hotel staff were incredibly professional and helpful -- they found me a laundromat nearby and gave me instructions when I asked. Only two minor hang ups: I decided to extend my stay by one night and was charged the full price for that night (or double what I paid on hotels.com); I should have checked to see what the rate was when I made that agreement, so that was rather foolish. As for the other: a bottle of hairspray went missing from my room; I choose to think someone on the housekeeping staff picked it up and forgot to put it back down (as I frequently returned to my room to find that housekeeping had arranged my toiletries more artistically), as ... who steals hairspray? Really. As this happened on my last night and I left early, I never recovered it, although the hotel staff did say they'd look into it for me (but, again, given the time of the disappearance and my train the next morning, it was futile and I knew it). Nothing else ever went missing from my room and my bags appeared untouched the entire time, so I find it amusing rather than a theft. If you are concerned about that, there's an in room safe -- it was actually large enough to hold my seventeen inch laptop: a truly unexpected (and far too welcome) surprise.

The hotel itself is in an excellent location and can be found very easily from the Orienburger Tor stop. We found the staff more than helpful and extremely friendly. My boyfriend ripped his jacket, they took it away to get repaired and it was fixed and in our room the following day. They also made a huge effort when we asked them for the best place to hire bikes and came back with an address and full directions in a matter of minutes. The hotel is very modern and the rooms are wonderful with fabulous views of Orienburger Strasse. Although half the room is window and the hotel is located on a main street and next to a nightclub, we heard very little noise unless the window was open. Mitte itself (in our opinion) is the place to stay, it's a very central location for all the main sights with an artistic, bohemian and very relaxed feel, there are literally hundreds of bars, cafes and resturants to choose from right on your doorstep. Don't let other reviews talking about drug dealers and prostitutes put you off. We didn't encounter one person selling drugs and although prostitutes are out on the streets at night, they are definately not in your face. It's not a seedy or intimidating area and the streets are as much filled with young families, couples and old peple as they are with ladies of the night! To be honest, it's more fascinating and a bit sad rather than scary or seedy. Things to do: Hiring bicycles, if you can, cannot be recommended enough. It's such a good way to see a large part of the city. Get a good map and get out there and join the hoards of locals on their bikes. The museum at Checkpoint Charlie is worth a vist, it's a bit run down but packed to the rafters with information about the turbulent history of Berlin. Try the singapore resturant right opposite the hotel. It's usually pretty busy after 7pm but the food is excellent and the staff are really nice and friendly. It stays open to about 3am on the weekends too. There is a venue right next door to the hotel (on the right as you come out the door). It's a lively wee outdoor place with great music and a kind of festival feel. It seems to stay open all night on a Saturday night as we got up to catch our flight on sunday morning and it was still going. If anyone still feels young enough, it seems to be the place to go! Have a look around Auguststrasse area. There's a corner of about three or four bars and resturants and it's really bustling and relaxed. The resturants serve people outdoors and there are some people playing guitars on the streets, it's a really nice area to eat. If your a coffee fan, go to the Espresso Ambulanze next door to the hotel (on the left as you come out). The guy in there is really lovely and he serves a great cappuccino Overall, we found Berlin to be an excellent place to visit for a few days and I cannot fault the hotel in any way. The location too was top class...great stay! Can I just finally give a warning to anyone flying with the COWBOY airline RYANAIR!! We thought we were doing a good thing by putting our luggage into one bag and checking only one item in. The 'computer-says-no' robot-lady at the desk informed us we would be charged \u20ac104 as our one bag was overweight, even though our stuff would not have been overweight if we had two bags to check in. THIS IS RYANAIR'S WAY OF GETTING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF POUNDS OUT OF PEOPLE...DO NOT LET THEM GET AWAY WITH IT ANY MORE!!! Be careful, if there are two of you going, take two bags and check them both in...practically every other person in our queue was being sent off to pay something towards Ryanair, they're a bunch of cowboys!

However, after 2 successive mornings of wandering around the locality in search of a menu to satisfy everyone's needs I would recommend the hotel buffet breakfast. It was superb. I am a vegetarian and generally suffer when it comes to European buffets, but there was plenty of choice beyond the typical meat options. The cereals & muesli accompanied by a variety of seeds and yogurt were divine. Plenty of fresh breads, pastries and good coffee make it worthwhile. If you book the breakfast the night before you can avail of the reduced rate at 12 euro. The staff at Arcotel Velvet were very friendly and helpful. This hotel is in a great location if you want to stay in Mitte and are interested in a more bohemian area. Numerous buses, trams and the underground are available outside the door of the hotel so the shopping districts and sites are within easy reach. I would recommend the Welcome card for short stays. A 48 hour or 72 hour travel card are available which also act as a discount card for some museums and sites.", "Date": "July 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cGood choice in Berlin\u201d", "Author": "sunred", "ReviewID": "UR7974973", "Content": "We booked this hotel through laterooms.com. Not the cheapest in Berlin, but we wanted to be in a good location and in a hotel of a decent standard, and we were very pleased with this choice. The Mitte district is very central to all attractions, and the hotel has lots of plus points in its location. A variety of bars, cafes and restaurants are in the immediate neighbourhood. The hotel has excellent transport links with tram, S bahn and U Bahn- all almost on the doorstep, so it's quick and easy to get around. The day passes for the transport system are really good value, especially as a family-15 euros for unlimited travel for a day for 4 of us. Try the Oranien cafe for a fab breakfast. (Turn right out of the hotel, walk down to where you see the S bahn and it is on the opposite corner). Beautiful setting, large round tables, very light and spacious, newspapers, mags available for relaxing with. We were there on a Sunday just after 10am, but it filled up very quickly after that time.We didn't try the hotel for breakfast as this cafe had more choice and was better value. Also try one of the small cafes across from the hotel (to the left as you look from the hotel)- very good, but the service is slow, so not if you're in a rush! The cafe next door is also good for a coffee and cake. Hackesher Mkt is worth a visit. Only a couple of stops on the tram. Walk round the corner from the hotel to get the tram on the way, but on the way back the tram stops just opposite the hotel. Good shops, cafes, restaurants and entertainment. We ate at a Spanish tapas bar and it was a good evening.Also useful for a supermarket if you want to buy some bottled water, snacks etc. Another dinner recommendation is the Cuban restaurant. Turn right out of the hotel, cross the road and it's just down there. Good range, healthy portions and good value. Don't eat at the Italian on the corner next to the hotel -very average. Overall, we found eating out in Berlin to be really good value when compared to other European cities, and even to places in the UK. Plus, the food and service is MUCH better than the UK! Some reports say that the hotel is noisy. It was fine when we were there, but perhaps at different times of year..? Reception staff were friendly and efficient. Re the rooms- very clean, and modern. We really liked them. If you read other reviews you will know that the shower and sink are open to the bedroom apart from a thin curtain, however, it really isn't a problem as the mirror pulls over screening most of the area. Also, it can be an advantage as the mirror is double sided, so if 2 people are trying to get ready at once, you can have one on each side! The toilet is separate. We liked the security aspect of the hotel- you have to put your room key into the lift, and it only stops at that floor, so no one else can access it. Didn't like the lounge/ bar in the hotel - cold (but it was February), smells of smoke and overpriced compared to every bar within 30 seconds walk. Cocktails and beer abound on every bar menu and lots of happy hour offers. Worth visiting -Alexander Platz tower, Tiergarten,outdoor art gallery (graffitti art on the wall), Berlin Zoo, - lots of other attractions depending on your own taste.

This is a good hotel that is in a truly excellent location however I guess some of the staff are just upsetting their clients. I booked this hotel directly with the internet, booking superior velvet rooms for my group at their internet rate of Euro 115,00 per night. However, upon leaving the hotel realised that they had charged me a rate of Euro 139,00 per room per night. Okay, I should have had my wits about me (but had a heavy night previously) but the hotel will not respond to my e-mails nor will anybody in authority return my calls. They simply do not seem to care now that I have left. Having said that, the rooms (at the front) have a tremendous view of the street, are bright, spacious and clean. The furnishings are funky and modern with lots of nice touches. Make sure you get a room overlooking the street as the picture windows are great (and maybe better than the suites on the top floof?). There are rooms with a more 'traditional' bathroom than discussed in other reviews. Disabled / superior rooms will have the traditional bathroom style although it is more of a wetroom than a bathroom. People have raved about the breakfast on this site but to be honest it is rather ordinary. There are much better and far funkier places to eat for better food and better value. Similarly, when surrounded by so many bars, it's pretty pointless staying in the hotel bar which is smart but fairly dull but massively overpriced. The location is excellent for the S-Bahn and for the trams and there is a great choice of nightlife in this area. However on Oranienburgerstrasse, be aware of the pushy (but non-aggressive) drugs dealers who try and ply you with coke and hash. I mean, even my 71 year old father was offered some (and he doesn't quite look like a user...)! Also be aware of the very pushy prositutes. They all look the same with orange tans, bleached hair, skinny jeans and bum bags. I'm sure that they'll leave you alone if you are a couple but they really want to ply you with their services. All harmless enough though! Berlin is a great place, especially the old east, the hotel is in a great location, just take confirmation of your booking with you when paying or the staff at th Arcotel Velvet will sting you for full rate.

Although the toilet is separate, the bath/shower and sink area is only partly screened from the bedroom by a sheer curtain - we didn't have any issue with this, but it's something to bear in mind if you are travelling with a friend rather than your partner (I'm not sure whether there are twin rooms, so maybe they are different?). Everywhere was clean and tidy and well-maintained. The room is relatively well equipped with toiletries but there is no shampoo provided and no coffee making facilities in the room which would have been nice. There is a mini bar with a variety of soft and alcoholic drinks, snacks and other items at typical hotel prices. Even if you don't purchase anything, you can empty it out and use it to keep your own drinks cool. The bartender was very good and would make drinks to your own specification if you wanted.

I had scanned the reviews of hotels and whittled it down to 2, the AV and the Golden Tulip. To help me decide I asked for advice from one of the local experts on TA and based on location they said the Velvet was best given our short stay, and it was just perfect. There was a tram and tube stop right by the hotel, although from the airport we got a taxi which cost 35 Euros including tip (but as we found our bearings during our stay we got the train back to Schonfeld airport for 2.10 Euro each!) . At the hotel on arrival we had a warm welcome and we got a non-smoking room on a higher floor (5th) that I had requested, I would probably say that it is worth staying on higher floor if you are a light sleeper (or go to bed early) as the street was buzzing all night, saying that though the thick glass did seem to cut nearly all of the noise out. The deal we got on the web did not include breakfast so we pre-booked that at the hotel the night before (it was cheaper if you did this at 12 Euro) although I only got this tip from the TA site, the reception did not actually point this out, just suggested we booked. However the brekkie was fantastic and I think worth it, everything you could think of (including sparkling wine if wanted), it certainly set us up for the day, and even if you did not see what you wanted they would get it for you, (e.g. eggs and also any coffee you wanted not just Americano). The rooms were immaculately clean and well presented, beds comfortable, soaps, shampoo, fluffy white towels, in-room safe, TV). From other reviews on TA I got the impression that all of the bathroom was incorporated in the bedroom (separated by a curtain) but in fact the toilet was totally separate\u2026.I thought it was a really good design, kind of quirky, nice and modern. There were loads of nice touches like a bottle of water and some mints in a bag on arrival\u2026also some apples in the room too. As a tip, I checked out the hotels own web-site just after booking and it was doing a 2 night weekend break special with breakfast at a better rate than I got. The location was perfect for all the sights and for plenty of bars and restaurants which were right outside the hotel door! With regards to sightseeing, I would personally say do a bus tour (we paid 15 Euros each) with a live commentary, as this will give you the orientation of Berlin. We then went back to the places we wanted to have a closer look at by walking or using the trains. (One down side with the bus was that it advertised as Hop on Hop off, 5 stops but ours would only let us get off at one, we used the Berlin company) All in all we loved Berlin and and the Arcotel Velvet and would definitely go back.", "Date": "October 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cSomething different....\u201d", "Author": "PCfoodlover", "ReviewID": "UR5951310", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for two nights in October 2006.

All I can say is that this is the best hotel I have stayed at in a very long time. The service you receive from the minute you walk into the lobby is brilliant. Most of the personnel in the lobby speak english, so communication is reasonably easy. I had a few \"technical difficulties\" getting the internet going, within minutes of a phone call the hotel handyman was at the door. The room we received ended up being a disabled room. This hotel caters for everyone. The room was very large and the bathroom was equally as big. One downside to the room we had was the shower was integrated into the whole bathroom, hence if you have a shower, the toilet gets wet as well. This is due to the disabled setup. It just requires prior planning before your shower :) Not all rooms are like this. From looking at the emergency exit plan in the hallway, the rooms come in all shapes and sizes. The bed was strange to say the least. It was two king single beds joined together at the base, but the mattresses werent, so there was a gap inbetween the mattresses. I dont know whether this is normal, but it didnt worry us too much. The room had floor to cieling windows which was good. The room also came with a DVD player and a LCD TV, albeit a small one (approx 20\") The location is fantastic. A tram stop is right outside the door, there would be at least 15 restraurants / food outlets in the street where the hotel is located. The selection caters for all budgets. The streets are quiet, and safe. Nightlife is very busy with all the restaurants about. The hotel is about 5 minutes in a cab from Haptbahnhof station and about 10 minutes from Ostbahnhof station. There is a coffee shop next to the hotel that has free Wireless internet. The internet in the hotel rooms (via LAN) costs 9 Euro for 12 hours, or 3.50 Euro for 30 mins. They also supply two computers in the lobby for free internet. There is hotel WIFI available in the lobby area. The hotel is very secure. You need your room key in the elevator to access your level only. I like this feature as it keeps unwanted people out of each individual floor. Cot facilities are available for infants, and high chairs also are available in the restaurant. The breakfast is worth the 11 EURO they charge. It is a massive banquet ranging from fruit, yoghurts, bread rolls, bread for toast, cereal, pastries, cakes, many juices, cold meats, its all available.

Overall it was a decent hotel, and I would certainly consider staying there again, although I would probably stay closer to Hackescher Markt. Pros: - Appears quite new, very clean, well-kept - Good air conditioning (rare in Berlin, as very few stores and bars seemed to have AC) - Large windows let in a great deal of light - Hotel feels safe and secure - Location is decent, especially if you want to go to cool bars at night Cons: - Mattresses are rather hard, and pillows are rather small and thin - Shower has no shower curtain (by design), and thus a modest amount of water splashes on the bathroom floor during a shower - Internet connection in the rooms is through a normal networking cable, not wireless. The desk will provide you with a networking cable if you need, but I think that they charge for this. Internet access in the room was rather expensive: 2.50 euros for 30 minutes, 9 euros for 12 hours, or 12 euros for 24 hours Other comments: - The flat-screen TV is nice and modern, with good speakers, but it seems a bit too small when viewed from the bed. A DVD player is also in the room. - The location is pretty decent. It is just a few doors down from Tacheles, which is a cool outdoor club that seems to have been cobbled together from scraps. There are also several other bars and clubs along the street. A few of the restaurants had large outdoor seating areas next to them. One of the Indian restaurants which was almost across the street from the hotel had a very large outdoor seating area that was decorated beautifully with many lights. The hotel is at the northwest end of Oranienburgerstrasse, very close to the Oranienburgerstrasse Tor U-Bahn stop. There are 2-3 doner kebab places nearby that are open very late. There is also a McDonald\u2019s by the U-Bahn stop that is open until 02.00 or so. A caf\u00e9 next door to the hotel, Caf\u00e9 Ambulanz, is convenient for a \u201cto go\u201d coffee in the morning. The hotel is only a short walk from the Museum Island. There are almost no retail stores along Oranienburgerstrasse, so it is not an interesting street for shopping at all. While I liked the location of the hotel, I would rather have stayed down near Hackescher Markt, as the square there is surrounded by a number of restaurants with very large outdoor seating areas. Street performers would entertain in the square. It seemed like a nice and festive atmosphere. While it was only a few long blocks from the Arcotel to Hackescher Markt, it was a bit far at the end of the night. Hackescher Markt does have more people there, and it is close to an S-Bahn station, so the noise there is probably greater. I also liked all of the shops along the main shopping street, Kurf\u00fcrstendamm. It was very pleasant to stroll along by the shops, and the area seemed nice and bustling overall. I will probably choose to stay near the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm next time. - To summarize about the location: The Arcotel Velvet is close to some fun bars, including Tacheles, a few restaurants, and little else. I might have preferred the Hackescher Markt (a few long blocks from the Arcotel) at the other end of Oranienburgerstrasse, which is a beautiful square with a number of restaurants with outdoor seating, as well as a few bars; it seemed a bit more fun overall. I also really liked the area of the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm (Ku\u2019damm), a broad boulevard full of interesting shops and restaurants, which makes for a great stroll; it is rather far from the Arcotel. - The room numbers are backlit numbers beside the door. Unlike another reviewer, I did not find them hard to spot or read at all. When you are in your room, you insert your card key into a slot near the front door in order to turn on the power to the room (which was explained well at the front desk). When you do so, it also changes the light on your room number from green to red. Thus, when you are in your room, your room number is red, and when you leave your room (and take your card key with you), the light changes to green. This is nice because it is like an automatic \u201cdo not disturb\u201d indicator. However, it also obviously lets anyone else on the hallway know that you are not in your room. The hotel seemed very safe and secure, so I really was not bothered by this, but I figured I would point it out for anyone who might be concerned about this. - Another reviewer or two mentioned that there are streetwalkers on the street by the hotel. I did not see any near the hotel, and I only saw a few when I walked down Oranienburgerstrasse to Hackescher Markt.

The hotel is surrounded by bars and restaurants of every nationality and interestingly a whole plethora of cocktail bars. Trendy but inclusive - not elitist.

The hotel is within walking distance of most of the interesting sights and it's a vibrant atmosphere with the feeling of creativity and a generally positive mood. Don't forget to bring DVD's and CD's as you can play them in your room. The hotel has a link to a dvd store which is useful - they return them for you. If you want to get an insight into what Berlin was like around the time of the wall coming down (and you have time) rent Goodbye to Lenin (it's an amusing film).

A good sized bathroom, lounge area, two TVs and DVD players (!), kitchen area and a well-stocked mini-bar made this a very pleasant stay. Presumably the smaller rooms don't have all these features, but if you're there for a long weekend or a special occasion, you should treat yourself to the suite. There's potentially a problem if you're a family - the street has a busy nightlife and the other end of Oranienburgerstrasse towards Alexanderplatz can be a bit sleazy, but we were up for the arty, bohemian experience and loved it. In the summer there was a large outdoor bar area across the back of the hotel that was quite noisy, but I for one enjoyed listening to the music and watching the film shows from the comfort of our balcony - but beware if you want a quiet night's sleep! There is an art / bar building adjacent to the hotel which may put some people off, but it made this trip into the former East Berlin all the more fascinating. There are a couple of bars / food stalls opposite and a McDonalds and Spar shop on the corner for all your needs. Also, an Irish pub around the corner on Friedrichstrasse for the ex-pats.

Couldn't book on Expedia for Sat night because it was booked out. Instead I booked at another \"design\" hotel in West Berlin. I did however book Sun night at the Arcotel again before departing on Monday. Price - Exceptional value when you compare it to other hotels in Berlin. While it does not have the gym and pool type facilities, this is definitely a \"design\"/\"boutique\" hotel, rather than one which has hundreds and hundreds of rooms and therefore you're never going to get your rooftop pool or basement gym. Doing a search of Expedia, this is one of the cheaper hotels, but having stayed there for 3 nights, it certainly did not feel like one. Perhaps only the 15 euro breakfast which I did not bother with since (a) that is expensive and (b) I always prefer to have breakfast in a cafe on the street. Service - Excellent, friendly service. Staff had no problems with English. Polite and courteous. Was also very helpful in giving suggestions on dining. Rooms - Take a look at the panoramic camera on their websites. Very funky. I stayed in rooms facing the street. Just note that the wall to wall glass is not a one-way mirror. Don't worry as there are blinds to ensure your privacy. The open access bath/shower concept is also very cool (and unexpected). Although this may make it difficult in terms of non-couples sharing a room, I still think it adds to the \"design\" feel and definitely feel it was the right choice. Not to worry, the toilet is separated. Rooms have flat screen TV with cable and, a DVD player! So bring your own DVDs or CDs if you want to watch movies or if you want to play your own music. You can also choose to hire DVDs from reception if you wish. Also, the hotel has two free internet terminals in the bar for its guests. Location - Absolutely perfect. I didn't realise this until after about 7 days in Berlin (I stayed in the Circus Hostel for the earlier parts of the week). Essentially, West Berlin is boring and does not have much except for Ku'daam which is a shopping strip similar to Champs Elysees (ie lots of tourist traps and international brands which you can get anywhere in the world and is probably quite boring if you're interested in local styles and shops). Most of the sites are in East Berlin (in fact, the walking/biking tours I went on did not even go into the Kudaam region) and this hotel is pretty much in the middle of it. 2 stations from Friedrichstrasse station (one of the main stations). Tram directly in front of the hotel takes you straight to Unter den Linden. Underground station about 50 metres away is the train line to Tegel airport (via bus 128 connection to the airport). Oranienburger Strasse (the street the hotel is on) is also one of the busiest streets in East Berlin, with plenty of cafes/bars/clubs. Funky galleries within 200-300 metres. The much more interesting and funky shopping is at the end of Oranienburger Strasse in the Hackeshen Markt/Hofe area. And most of the sites are within walking distance of this area. I also highly recommend walking/biking tours as unlike other cities, it's the history that makes the buildings in Berlin interesting. I went on the all day walking tour Brewers Berlin Tours and the biking tour with Fat Tire Bike Tours Berlin. If you have time, the walking tour will be more informative. Otherwise, I highly recommend riding around Berlin, as it is one of the bigger cities.
