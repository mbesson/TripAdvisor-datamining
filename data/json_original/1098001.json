{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice but not quite got it ! We stayed at the hotel for 7 nights. The staff were really friendly and very helpful. The pool areas were really disapointing, they were small and for a 4* hotel not that attractive. Next door a new hotel is being built (which I know the Alam Kul Kul cannot help) the grinding and banging noises when sat next to the pool were very annoying. The rooms were not as advertised on the internet and were dated although very clean. The location was good with the beach just over the road. We found the resturant and bar very overpriced, breakfast for 2 cost over $45!. Honestly if we were to go to Bali again we would stay at the Legian Beach hotel x", "Date": "Nov 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR504960763", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "sarahandcav"}, {"Content": "Great hotel and staff, but be aware of construction Alama Kul Kul is a great alternative to the more industrial hotels going up in Kuta and Legian. It has old style Balinese charm and the staff is wonderful. It is situated far enough away from Kuta to be out of the chaos and close enough to walk there is that is what you want. The beach across the street is more relaxed and, for you surfers, there is a nice, un-crowded break out front and just a few minutes walk to Padma.The only negative, which isn't the fault of Alam Kul Kul, is the big Mercure being built next door. The construction noise was annoying while at the pool, although we weren't bothered by it in the room. The new hotel dwarves the Alam and, hopefully, the palm trees planted between the two grow fast to hide it.I would definitely go back despite the new hotel as it is a sanctuary in a hectic part of the island.", "Date": "Sep 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR647742959", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "rickdoc"}, {"Content": "A great little hotel! This was a great little hotel located between Kuta and Legian. We stayed for four nights. On the first night we arrived and were given a room with no balcony / terrace, which was surprising as all of their rooms claim to have a balcony or terrace!! We complained and were upgraded to following day. The upgraded room was large and had an amazing bathroom, but with no door and perspex windows so you can see everything - not very private and you would need to know the peron you are sharing with very well!! The hotel is just across the road from the beach and has a great restuarant attached to it called Papa Johns which serves pizza and pasta at reasonable prices. On our second night we were invited to the sunset cocktail party which was free and you got lots of free cocktails and lovely nibbles to eat whilst watching the amazing sunset on Kuta beach. We had the breakfast option included and it was well worth it, there was a huge variety of food to cater for both western and asian tastes and the coffee was illy and very good. The swimming pools are quite small, but enough for a dip to cool you down. The Jamu Spa attached to the hotel is also excellent - i had an aromatherapy body massage - the theripists are well qualified and it is half the price of the UK!A word of warning... they are currently building a new hotel complex next door which is a building site. We did not get disturbed by any of the noise from the building works but it is not a pleasant view from the main pool. It is due to be finished next year.", "Date": "Aug 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR315888795", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "PipkinsLondon"}, {"Content": "Beautiful Property After being totally stuffed around by the Seaview Villas we were recommended to go to this property with a local travel agent who my wife had used before recommending the hotel. Got to say that we were really quite concerned but we had no choice and it was our honeymoon! Anyway to cut a really long story short, the property is great! Twio swimming pools so if you are looking to get a bit of privacy, its possible. Beautifully appointed rooms in a real balinese fashion located just so you feel you are a little secluded with out haviong to walk miles. Greart staff who are friendly with out being over familiar, a great breakfast. It is a little way out of the main Kuta area but it is right on the beach front so its a nice walk into the shopping area. Would recommed this property to anyone", "Date": "Jul 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR300240082", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "travelightFiji"}, {"Content": "Decepci\u8d38n total   showReview(19702970, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR236689556", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Ana021"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608487-d1098001-r21584458-Alam_Kul_Kul_Boutique_Resort-Legian_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1098001", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
