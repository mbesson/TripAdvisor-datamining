Hotel is average but nice. Main points: Plus: location Minus: bad smell from bathroom, no lobby (small desk reception), no bar, no... Hotel is perfect if you get good price and if you want just bed. It doesn't provide you with any additional service. Staff is friendly and helpful. Its all about location. Nothing else. Here are the main tips for Barcelona visit: Do not eat on La Rambla! Its poor and very expensive. try to find other places and here are tips from my friends from Barcelona and the y are VERY useful: You have to visit LA BOQUERIA. It is the best market (fresh food) we have in Barcelona. You have the possibility to do a \"Brunch\" (= breakfast and lunch) in one of the bars/restaurants you have inside. We suggest you to go to the bar called \"BAR PINOCHO\" (entering the main entrance of La Boquer\u00eda from the street Las Ramblas, turn right or just ask anyone). Places to visit: We suggest you to go to the Tourist information Office (very close from your hotel) and ask them for the Tourist bus and suggestions. But do not forget to spend time at \"The Gothic Neighborhood\" (Old city). You will see the Cathedral, nice churches like L\u00b4Esglesia del Mar, Plaza del Pi, etc... Close to this last place \"Plaza del pi\", there is a very traditional coffee shop called \"GRANJA DULCINEA\" (Street Petritxol n\u00ba 2) where you can ask for a \"SUIZO\" (Hot Spanish style chocolate + cream). Very nice place and better food. RESTAURANTS: \"MERENDERO DE LA MARI\" One of our favorite restaurants for eating PAELLA, fish and seafood in Barcelona is: (to do a reservation is hardly recommended). Ask at the hotel. Phone: 93. 221 31 41 (www.merenderodelamari.com) Recommended for lunch and diner. Another very nice and traditional restaurant for fish is \"CAN SOLE\" (Sunday evening and Monday closed ) Carrer Sant Carles 4 (www.cansole.cat) One of the best restaurants from Galicia in Barcelona (you can have very good seafood) is \"CASA DARIO\" at Consell de Cent 256. Phone: 93 453 31 35 \"GORRIA\" If you love steaks, we recommend you this restaurant. You can taste the best Spanish ham and some specialties from the north of Spain (Navarra). It is one of the favorite restaurants of many futbol players of FC Barcelona. Street Diputacion 421 - Phone: 93 245 11 64. You have to ask for \"Chulet\u00f3n steak\" ( check pictures). If you would like to eat some typical Tapas, we suggest you to go to: \"CERVECERIA CATALANA or CIUDAD CONDAL\" (both from the same owner) \"CERVECERIA CATALANA\": Street MALLORCA 236 (very close from the street called RAMBLA CATALUNYA). Remember this street because you are going to go up and down several times these days because is the second best shopping street. : ) \"CIUDAD CONDAL\" Street Rambla Catalunya 18 We went there four time. You will need to wait 20 minutes to be seated but its worth. Just go to the reception lady and ask for table. Dont wait in crowd!!! The best shopping streets are: PASSEIG DE GRACIA and RAMBLA CATALUNYA. If you are on top of Passeig de Gracia and you like to have a lunch or diner, I suggest you to go to: \"RESTAURANTE TRAGALUZ\" (Passatge de la Concepci\u00f3 5) Phone: 93 487 06 21 http://www.grupotragaluz.com/rest-tragaluz.php If you like Japanese food (we adore Japanese food), you must go to: \"KOY SHUNKA\" Street Copons 7 (very close to the Cathedral). Phone: 93 412 79 39 (www.koyshunka.com) If you want pasta and risotto from Italy we suggest you to go to \"DA GRECO\" at Passeig de Gracia 116. You have to take into account that restaurants open at 20:30 for dinner, so if you like to have a glass of wine before going to this places, I suggest you to go to: \"MON VINIC\" Street Diputaci\u00f3 249. And if you want to have a drink after the dinner you can go to: \"HOTEL OMM\" at Street Rosell\u00f3 265. If you want to go dancing go to: \"LUZ DE GAS\" Street Muntaner 246.

The heating/air-con is centrally controlled but can be turned off. We had a balcony door slightly open and there was a moderate amount of traffic noise - only to be expected. There was space in the fridge for our own drinks and the room was thoroughly cleaned daily with fresh bed-linen. Wi-fi was a bit patchy at times but the room lighting was good for reading.

The only down side of the hotel is the air conditioning. This is bizarrely controlled centrally ! ! So every room in the hotel has the temperature set by whatever is decided by the hotel. The result is the balcony doors had to be opened to cool the room down before sleeping. This would not be an option in the summer, as the Ramblas never sleeps, and the noise would be intolerable. I assume the air conditioning would be at a suited level during the summer months. The AC unit on the wall can only be turned on or off - no temperature adjustments. The bed was slightly hard and mine was slightly lopsided. The female hotel receptionist endeavoured to cover my room request before arrival, which proves the quality of service. The hotel reception is very small, but the hotel is more than adequate for a stay. The rooms and building itself give no feeling of claustrophobia despite the small lobby.

This hotel was not worth spending on average $200 per night for an entire week. It is true that this is a small botique hotel, but this small botique hotel has many problems for being so small. When I booked this hotel I did so because of the following factors: free wi-fi, location, air conditioning and the Eurostar name. The wi-fi was on and off, the reception was good at times and other times it would not pick up a signal so I would have to go on their breakfast floor to sit down and do some work. The location is great as it is in the middle of the Rambla. My biggest problem was with the air conditioning. The hotel says that they have air conditioning, but the room was so hot. I complained to the front desk and they said that because they are between seasons the air has not been turned on in the hotel, but please note that the air was on in the lobby of the hotel. I told him that I was unable to stay there like that and he offered to give me a key handle to open the window to get cooler air into the room. Well I did not get the handle to open the window until I told the agent that I am going to request a lower rate or switch hotels as I could not stay in a hot hotel room. Once the window was open I did get fresh cool air, but the noise level from outside was so loud and it was loud 24/7. Thank goodness I brought ear plugs from reading another review here that this area is loud. The last day the air conditioning was finally turned on as I guess too many people complained as the inside temperature on the thermostat was in the high 70s once you convert it over. Well when they finally did turn on the air conditioning the temperature was in the mid 60s, which was way too cold. I definately would not choose this hotel. Please double check the hotel as you want to have an air conditioner that you can control and one that is not centrally controlled where you cannot change the temperature. The rooms are very small, but decorated very tastefully. My last day there the housekeeper did clean the room, but not my bathroom. I did not complain as I work as a Director of Housekeeping for a Chicago hotel and did not want to get anyone in trouble.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia Beach, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cok place, great location, probably won't stick with Eurostars brand\u201d", "Author": "HomeAwayFromHome2", "ReviewID": "UR103802197", "Content": "Hotel facilities lovely-- clean modern room, nice view of La Rambla (right on the street), noise not a problem but we're used to big cities.

I'll start with the latter because other reviewers seem to have captured all the good points. Well, as evidenced by the title of my review, do not stay here if you want a good night's sleep. I am admittedly a light sleeper but my fiancee is the total opposite and she could not sleep a wink either. We had a corner room, with one side facing Las Ramblas and the other overlooking the market. I identified this as a problem as soon as we checked in but reception assured me that noise would not be a problem due to the double-paned glass. I don't think a 6 foot thick concrete wall could keep the noise out of this room. Cars would roar by non-stop, as would emergency response vehicles with their sirens blasting. On top of that was the seemingly never-ending buzz from people talking and partying. Fantastic if that is what you are looking for but awful if you want some rest after a long flight. Overall, the room was quite nice, in-room safe, flat-panel tv. The room was on the smaller side but quite comfortable, except for the roach that came to visit. The bathroom was elegantly appointed, marble everywhere but once again, I do have a complaint. The shower leaked everywhere. As you have probably read, the location is fantastic for touring. Right beside the market, walking distance to the subway, hop-on/hop-off buses, the gothic quarter etc. There is also a grocery store nearby (Carrefour) where you can buy things much, much cheaper than at the hotels.

The hotel is pretty secured and even though they lock the front door at night, there's always someone to buzz you in. The staff could have been better at recommending places but it's no big deal because my husband and I ended up walking through small side streets and explored them ourselves. You are in the center and it's very easy to get to anywhere. The nearest Metro stop is only about 50 ft away. Since you're surrounded by restaurants and food options, you really don't need to eat breakfast at the hotel. Don't eat at restaurants on Las Ramblas though because I think they are not so good. Breakfast is fine. We actually found this restaurant called Ra right behind the hotel after walking around. The food was awesome.. and quite inexpensive. We called housekeeping once to take care of the locked balcony door (you have to get a handle from the front desk) and they came right away. Wifi is free with password provided at the front desk.

The towels have a strange smell, and i suppose it was the only thing changed regularly. I think it's unacceptable for a 3* hotel, not to change sheets at all, for a 6 day stay. The breakfast room is tiny and serves the guests from 7pm to 10 pm. We asked for butter at 9.50 pm and the waitress, obviously unhelpful, said it was finished. (!) The other day we asked for cheese and she said the same thing. Then, tha lady from the reception desk came upstairs to the breakfast room and they had some kind of an argument i guess, because she wasn't serving the guests. The staff at the reception is quite helpfull, but they are clueless about the the city and what to do where. They all replied the same thing, when asked for info. ''I'm not from here''.
