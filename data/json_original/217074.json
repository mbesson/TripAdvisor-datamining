Pro: - easy to find - free parking - free shuttle bus to centre - good size room Cons: - only very few non-smoking room, of course when asked for non smoking they said it is fully booked. (maybe it was on the first night, but for sure not on the 2 other days) - no fridge in the room - no internet in the room - only one chair in a double room I think it is very expensive, but everything looks like very expensive in Key West, so be prepared for that. The room was ok (clean and good sized), but smelled from cigarette (it was a smoking room) and had no fridge. As we did not had one on the road side, but looking to the small garden it was actually quite nice, and no issues with sound whatsoever. It is not very close to the centre, but you can take the free bus service, or you can hire a bicycle/scooter. Even on a bicycle you can reach the city in 20 mins. The Waffle House right at the hotel was packed every morning, but actually I had the worst experience with staff there for the whole holiday.

I will add that I flew for a living with the US Marine Corps and stayed in 100's of hotels both in the US and around the world. This hotel would not rate in the top half but it is far better than many hotels with big promises. Friendly staff with concierge service, decent pool and the best rate in Key West (trust me I tried). My stay started with an online purchase which turned out to be a huge savings for a 3 night stay. We were upgraded to a suite that was smoking but the living room was the only room that the smell was noticable. Having a full size fridge, sofa and comfortable second room was worth the tradeoff on the smoking room. I have stayed in many rooms converted to nonsmoking rooms that had the exact same smell but no break in price, We had a King bed with a balcony and a bathroom shared by the two rooms. All of the interiors were dated but it appeared clean and was comfortable. Cabs will be the best bet for travel to Duval St (the main street) but $15.35/trip is worth the savings. To summarize: this hotel is not the Ritz Carlton that's why its branded a Days Inn. Considering the price and being in Key West there isn't a better option.

The room overwhelms you with the \"air spray cover up\". Fortunately, we did not have to stay in the room that much, but when we did, sleeping was difficult with the bedding having been sprayed. Even the pillows. The carpet was dirty and the bathroom tub could have been better cleaned. The Lobby Check-In staff is pleasant and efficient, but that doesn't make up for their product. As far as location goes, it really doesn't make too much difference on Key West, as most everything is in close proximity. This hotel has a 24 hr. diner adjoining the lobby that complements the lodging facilities. It's an Awful House, if you get my drift. So, not to belabor the point, for a few dollars more you should be able to find much better accommodations on Key West.

Since this was a quick guys weekend, we wanted to keep costs down and a place to sleep. So I pricelined the hotel and ended up with the Days Inn for $80 a night. The place was exactly what I expected. The hotel itself was ok. We checked in late at night and the front desk person was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and updated but the room safe did not work. We weren't worried about the safe since we weren't leaving much in the room. The hotel is right at the entrance of Key West so having the rental car was helpful since most of the activity is around Duvall street. Parking at Days Inn is free. The next time I go to Key West I will look around Duvall. There seem to be bed and breakfast as well as other small hotels for not much more a night. As expected the guests at the Days Inn were a real mix of people.. young singles, families etc. At night, I got the sense it is not a good area. I saw one individual walk toward the car with a small bag of something, we signaled \"no\" and drove off. The front desk person told us that breakfast was provided but it \"wasn't much\". I appreciated the honesty. There is a Waffle House attached which we did not utilize. We preferred to eat at one of the many great places around the Keys. One afternoon, we were a bit tired so we went back and tried the pool. The pool was clean but the water was hot, which is what I expected, again this is the Days Inn and we are in Key West in August. The Days Inn is an ok place to stay. I felt safe being with friends but would not have felt comfortable if I went on my own. I would check into hotels/bed and breakfast around Duvall Street, especially if you are not bringing a car. If you do have a car and plan on staying around Duvall you will need to ask about parking.

We went to Key West, FL and booked this hotel because it was about the only thing affordable in our price range. Knowing what I do now, I would have stayed fewer days and paid more for something else. The Good: Probably the best thing is the pool scene. Also, generally you don't hear the neighboring room noise. The Bad: Ice machines that don't work, room safes that don't work, bad TV reception, poor quality/old construction that has seen better years and needs refurbished. The Ugly: Noise from cars and people walking by your room at all hours of the day and night. People carrying on at 2 a.m. like it's the middle of the day. When we arrived, I had already made it known that we wanted a quiet room away from the noise. David, the supervisor acknowledged our request and for some unknown reason put is in a room facing the parking lot (room 252). I should have known better but thought he knew the property better than me. What a mistake! It was near the maid's room (Grand Central Station) and was also at the the top of the stairs so everyone had to walk by at all hours of the day and night. We finally went to the office after night 3 (they were very nice and wondered why we were put in 252 to begin with) and moved us to room 239 which faces the courtyard and was 100% better. Still you have the drunks walking by at 2,3 and 4 a.m. carrying on like it was the middle of the day. That's not the hotels fault, mind you, but just a word to the wise... This hotel needs a serious makeover. I think if your only there a night or two and can't afford something better, well.... okay, at least you stayed in KW and got to enjoy the Mallory Square scene and other sights.

Having said this, it did not really matter as we were not in Key west to spend much time at the hotel, only to sleep, and as our own aircon was running in the night, any further noise was no bother. The room interior was perfectly clean, although a little dated. I would say the pool needed cleaning, so we did not use it. The included breakfast is essentially coffee plus prepackaged Danish, that's it. However, there is a Waffle House on-site and a Denny's in the Radisson which is walkable.", "Date": "February 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cGood place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Edmtourist", "ReviewID": "UR6590451", "Content": "After reading other reviews, I was nervous about our stay here. I had read about reservations being lost - so I confirmed our reservation 3 times before we went. Each time, our reservation was confirmed and we checked in with no problem. Rooms were very adequate for our stay. With the price savings at this hotel, we could afford to splurge on a great meal in Key West. You are away from the action of downtown Key West, but it is only a 5 to 10 minute drive to a parking garage within walking distance of the Conch Train Tour. Kids used the pool and were happy with it. The Waffle House is within the complex and is a great place for breakfast.", "Date": "January 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "centerburg, ohio", "Title": "\u201crelaxing, convenient, economical, good deal\u201d", "Author": "chippsch", "ReviewID": "UR5406582", "Content": "We had a great 3 day stay here.

If you are looking for luxury go somewhere and pay $300 and up, but if you want a good, clean hotel suite go here, you can't beat the price. By the way, we had no problems with desk clerks.
