We stayed for 4 nights in this 3 stars hotel and if the rooms were a little bigger we could say it was a four star hotel. Amazing and nice staff from the front desk to the ones who made our room, changed towels every single day and those who served perfectly our breakfast. We were very impressed by the staff who are very friendly and helpfull. Our room was clean everyday, everything was changed from towels to bath foam and garbage removal. The hotel is in Eixample district, a couple of blocks away from Urgell metro station (Red Line L1) or bus 59 is closer and takes you to Catalunya, down to Rambla and to Pg. Maritime, station Barceloneta, to the beach. On down lows are smalls things who can be overall not taken in consideration, the heating system makes a little noise like all of this kind, the rooms are not very big but they are wonderful, the bath is very nice, cousy, marble. Nearby the hotel are some restaurants, Grocery and Fruit Shops, Supermarkets, but I strongly recommend Mercat de la Boqueria for a real taste of Barcelona. Thank you Century Park Hotel for a wonderful staying.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sofia, Bulgaria", "Title": "\u201cHotel Century Park: good place for a visit to Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "Ivan61Sofia_Bulgaria", "ReviewID": "UR122968283", "Content": "I'd recommend this hotel, as chipper and with very good location.

The restaurants and bars were frequented by locals, prices were much cheaper, and speaking a little Spanish was a necessity at times. The hotel had good public transport links. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Rooms were very clean and perfectly adequate, good value for the price we paid. We went to visit the Sagrada Familia and the queues were extremely long. A helpful Security Guard explained that if we bought the tickets from the CAIXA we would be able to walk straight in without waiting. The ATM machine is situated inside the CAIXA and it was a simple process to book the tickets. Lots of other events can be booked this way to avoid wasting your holiday in long lines. Note: The hotel did not know that it was possible to book the tickets this way. We would definitely return to Hotel Century Park and to Barcelona.

The night receptionist was so helpful and polite. When we got to our room on the 5th floor i was a little taken aback at how small the room was. We had twin beds instead of a double which is what i had booked. The room was dated and the bathroom was a throwback to the 70's! However, the bed was comfortable and I slept like a baby each and every night. The room was clean and that was the main thing really. I dont think there were any other visitors on the 5th floor as it was quiet. The walls are quite thin so I expect it could get noisy. I was really pleased overall. There is free internet access in reception. The staff were so helpful and polite, the hotel wasn't too far from the nearest 2 metro stations, about a 10 minute walk. The only thing I would say is that there are no late night shops open nearby so if you want drinks or snacks for the room buy them early on in the day.

The breakfast was more than adequate and even though the lounge was small we always found a free table. The stuff was very hepfull and always willing to give us tips about the city. The only downside was that the hotel is on a rather busy street so you cant have the windows open during rush hours, its too noisy (but with windows closed the soundproofing is excellent). It is a bit far from Rambla and the centre of the city, but metro station in 3 blocks away, so no big deal.

On one hand there is the good location and the friendly staff. But on the other you get to have your personal belongings STOLEN and even if you complain, they do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about it. Before we came to Barcelona me, my husband and two friends went to London for a few days. Because we're all fans of English cheese we bought 50\u00a3 worth of it, along with organic nuts and what not. And guess what? All of that was stolen from the room's fridge! How stupid is that??? Of course, this might look like a joke to some but what about the fact that our friends had all their money and their camera stolen from their room? Those of you who stayed in Century Park and weren't robbed have no idea how lucky you are. Not only that but my husband got mugged during our sight-seeing tour. Imagine that: admiring the absolutely stunning design of Antonio Gaudi's houses and suddenly realizing that OOPS! Your money and credit cards are missing! A word of advice: DO NOT use the underground. They only tell you that there is 24-hour surveillance but apparently they put the cameras there for decoration. The situation is so tragic that the ONLY WAY to avoid getting mugged in Barcelona and in Century Park Hotel in particular is to go there with nothing but the clothes on your back.

The hotel location is futher from the train station (Sants) then the website suggests. They say 500m but I'd say it's closer to 1000m! It's a 15/20 min walk to the top of La Rambla.
