We had reserved a standard room - nothing special but breakfast included, we was very surprised when we got into our room, it was huge, like a suite!! So with minibar, dressing gowns and slippers we was very pleased, together with the spaciousness of the room and the coolness of the air-conditioning too. The air conditioning was so needed as it was very very hot in Berlin at the time of our stay, we have also stayed in other Mercure's in Berlin and they didn't have this facility. We was in Berlin for a clubbing/ festival weekend, so we got in late, got up for breakfast, went back to sleep and got out for around 1400hrs each day. The breakfast was buffet hot and cold, very satisfied! Even though we left our room very late, we came back and it had been spotlessly cleaned too! We would stay again, although the only downside was the surrounding area; a few minutes walk to the underground no problems however the area was very run down. This was a little uncomfortable when walking back at night, in the day too; there are lots of cheap shops/ kebab houses etc. Anyway for a perfectly comfortable stay it does the job fine!", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cQuite a nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "ReisenistmeinHobby", "ReviewID": "UR115066087", "Content": "This hotel has a nice lobby and bar area with computer access (free, but there are only two computers, so you may have to wait), comfortable rooms, and an excellent breakfast buffet.

At this kind of price it has to be one of the best value hotels I've ever stayed in. The rooms are exceptionally clean and in superb condition (mine even had a kitchenette!), the beds are large and very comfortable and the bathroom is spotlessly clean and of a good size. Worth noting if you're arriving with a car is it's free to park on the street 2 minutes walk away but failing that the hotel offers an underground garage for about \u20ac10 per night.

Website states it has free continental breakfast, wireless and transportation to the airport. It has the breakfast but it didn't come with my room. When I asked about why the wireless wasn't working I was told that it's no longer included in the price. The phones didn't work either. I mentioned that their website still has the wireless listed as an amenity. No response. I asked about the free transportation to the airport and was told that would be no problem. I needed to check out at 3:30 AM to catch my flight. When the cab arrived the driver wanted cash. I told him it was supposed to be free. He insisted it wasn't and was going to drive off. I convinced him to wait while I went back in to check. The staff member at the front desk asked how much he wanted and I told them. They wrote a note in German (which I don't read) and told me to give it to the driver. The driver became upset when he read it - they had promised to give him money later but it was less than what the trip cost. Since the meter had been running he would have been really short. I told him I'd pay the difference as I didn't want to miss by flight. On a positive note, the room was huge if that's important to you.", "Date": "August 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberlady, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOk experience\u201d", "Author": "MissyAl", "ReviewID": "UR6908514", "Content": "I stayed here for 4 nights whilst attending a conference at the Hotel Estrel (10 mins away in a taxi).
