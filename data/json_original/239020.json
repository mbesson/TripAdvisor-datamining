The prices is in the range of a Motel 6 and has every basic thing: a bed, closet, free safebox, bathroom, hot shower, television, hair dryer and an elevator.\u00c2\u00a0 Now, Amsterdam is a very old city and therefore the hotel is quite old and musty but it has its charm, it is quite conviently located a kilometer away from the heart of the city and a few more meters from central station. If you are carrying a backpack, it would take about fifteen minutes to walk from central station to the hotel, and if you're carrying more stuff and/or don't want to walk, just take the 172 bus from central station and it is a brisk ten minute drive to Raampein stop were it is in front of the hotel. The trip will cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2. I recommend the \"I amsterdam\" pass for three days, with it you can take the city's tram and bus services, and can get into the most important \u00c2\u00a0museums in town. As for me, the real treat was to rent a bike, which costs between \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15 per day, as just rode arount Amsterdam, it is amazing how many people use this transportation method, I wish I lived in a city like it but I digress.\u00c2\u00a0 Some of the rooms have a very distinct smell of old so for the faint of heart I recommend to use a room deodorant that can be easily bought in a store or better yet bring one from the US, obviously much cheaper, and just plug it in the electrical outlet just don't forget to \u00c2\u00a0buy your American-European converter because it will cost you double in Holland. Buy one from eBay, they're so cheap it's ridiculous and they work nicely.\u00c2\u00a0 One of the best things is the hotel staff, they're very kind and welcoming, it just feels like a bed and breakfast, and speaking of breakfast, it is included in the hotel fee as a contentinental but not like in the US were it is just bread, butter and old coffee, at Hotel de Paris it is a real treat with quite a charming room. I had such a good breakfast that I looked forward to it every morning.\u00c2\u00a0 The drawbacks is that it is a bit noisy because of the streets and the other rooms so, if you can, request a room from the back, those are less noisy, and watch out for the stairsa because they're seemed to be made for children, I'm 5' 11\" and almost loose my footing a couple of times.\u00c2\u00a0 Overall, I recommend this hotel for all travelers who just want a nice, private and centric room at good price. I will defintely will reserve again in this hotel next time I visit Amsterdam. Any questions please feel free to send a message, I will answer as best as I can.\u00c2", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bhubaneswar", "Title": "\u201cAverage but Comfortable\u201d", "Author": "prakdora", "ReviewID": "UR121621839", "Content": "The location of the hotel is good and close to Leidsplein square.

Most alarming of all. As found in our room, was the obvious underfloor leak. Our two night stay, meant we had to lay a copious amount of towels, over an obvious leak.

When I travel to new cities, all I really need is a clean room with a bed that I can sleep well in, and this fit the bill; the beds were really comfortable and everything was pretty clean. The bathroom was very modern looking and was pretty large considering the size of the room itself. I also really enjoyed eating breakfast out in the lobby/bar area in the mornings. The breakfast was the best continental breakfast I've ever had at a hotel; I remember scrambled eggs, deli meat and cheeses, tons of fruit and breads, and lots of juices to choose from. My only complaint is that we came across a staff member that acted pretty peculiar. My female friend and I were greeted by this really friendly (maybe too friendly) guy who checked us in, gave us our key, and then gave us directions on how to find the room. We get in there, unpack a bit and relax when suddenly the man, who checked us in just minutes before, opens the door to our room and walks in. We jump, because we're not expecting anyone to come into the room, and he acts startled, too, then just turns around on his heel and walks out of the room without a word. My first thought was, \"Wow. we're a couple of huge idiots for not locking the hotel room door behind us\" and my second thought was, \"Pretty strange, considering he just gave us a key to this room, told us directions to this room, and we made it pretty obvious we were coming straight up to this room.\" My friend joked that maybe he was hoping to walk in on the two of us girls right in the middle of a topless pillow bed on top of one of the beds, but joking aside, we were still wary by his unexplainable behavior. From then on, we were sure to lock the deadbolt when we were in the room, and we took absolutely all of our valuables with us when we left for the day to explore. My friend chose this hotel for us. I would say that for the most part she picked well as far as it's location and price goes. I think the next time I travel to Amsterdam, I might be more comfortable staying at this hotel with my boyfriend then I would by myself or with another female again, but on the other hand, I wasn't so completely blown away by this place that I would absolutely stay here again.

It was larger than I expected - after staying in several Amsterdam hotels you tend to expect to sleep in tiny box rooms and you could actually walk round this room in the hotel which was pleasing. It also had a safe which I appreciated. One major benefit was the fact we had a balcony overlooking the street which we were on - this was not expected and not asked for and so we felt priviledged. Another major thing was that we turned up four hours before check-in time, expecting to leave our luggage in a little room. However the gentlemen behind the desk asked us to wait five minutes and got our room ready for us which was unbelievably nice, again making us feel very priviledged indeed. The bed (two pushed together to make a double - not the end of the world) was comfy and clean, the room was a smoking one but didn't smell of smoke or have burns everywhere... overall we were pleased. A few negatives - the shower looked old and limescaled and the tray clogged up when we used it, however the actual shower was powerful and hot and did the job. I suppose the cleanliness of the shower was an issue but neither of us died from it so I can't complain really. The sink also leaked when used but that was nothing a towel, put underneath to catch the drips, didn't solve. The taps still worked so it didn't bother us. The only other negative was that the cleaners left a lot of their sheets and whatnot in the hallways, but this was not a major issue. None of the cleaners barged in on us like they have done at other hotels; instead they put a useful \"to be cleaned\" sign on the door. As for the rest - great elevator (looked new), stairs weren't as bad as I've experienced before, staff were extremely helpful and friendly, no curfew, all-hour bar, decor quirky and i liked it.

The reason they classify this hotel as a three star hotel is probably the location, because the hotel itself is nothing special. Location was perfect for me, and I actually enjoyed walking to most places where the attractions are. Also, it was a nice relief to get away from an American style hotel. This hotel was smaller and I liked that aspect of it. Yes, the stairs are steep especially if you are carrying luggage, but unless you have a disability, or are really old, you should be ok. I actually liked the stairs, they were different! I like different! The rooms are very basic. We had two beds put together and that was ok by me. The beds were comfortable enough, and I really didn't hear any outside noise. The bathrooms were perfectly fine as well. The front desk person was always extremely friendly. I didn't catch his name, but he was an older gentleman that always smiled. If you get a good deal, I would highly recommend this hotel.

The room was big enough for three of us and the bathroom was big enough being tiled from floor to ceiling and the room having wooden flooring. The breakfast was ok consisting of a selection of meats, cheese and breads, boiled egg, tea, coffee and orange juice and you could have as much as you want.

The people who have written the previous reviews cannot be living in the real world, this hotel is not what they are saying it is. The only bad thing I have to say is it was a little noisy when they were doing the breakfast as we where directly underneath, I would not expect it to be like this upstairs, but it acted as an alarm call to get up for breakfast.
