Staff were helpful and the breakfast was good with several choices. Overall, I'd say this was 3 star and not 4. It is no more than a 10 minutes walk to Cornelia Metro and if you buy your ticket from the newsstand across from the hotel it saves time in the station. Line A closes at 9.00pm so staying in the City Centre means you are dependent on taxis. Beware of unscrupulous taxi drivers. The set fee of \u20ac30 from the airport is to the city centre, not Via Aurelia. There is a surcharge after 10pm so even after agreeing a price at the airport our driver wanted much more than the agreed fee. On the return journey to the airport I recommend taking the bus from Termini station. It is only a 20 minutes journey.

I had a room at the highest floor (I guess) with lovely terrace and with garden table and swing, and of course with the great view. (see photos) Breakfast is rich and tasty (for Italy), staff was friendly and helpful, they always helped me with the busses, metro, sightseeing plans etc. Teh location of this hotel is more suitable for business purposes, so you simply do not care, that you stay 20 minutes of walk or short journey of bus No. 246 or 247 (stop 50m from hotel) to Cornelia metro station (Linea A) or Bus 916 to Pza. Venezia. Or if you looking for a safe location out of busy city centre or Termini area, it is a good choice. This hotel is also a good choice for those who travels by car, because Via Aurelia is easy accessible by car, and you do not have to be worry, you lose nerves in traffic jams in central Rome. There is a great traditional restaurant just across the street, or Pizzeria (Pizza Bar) 100m from the hotel. The big supermarket (In Grande) is located near Cornelia metro station.

I arrived in the middle of august with my parents an teenage daughter. The rooms were very nice with clean and had a bright clean bathroom. (Bit stingy on the toilet tissue though) We were very comfortable there. However i now realise the importance of having a swimming pool and restaurant facitilies in your hotel grounds. As we were there in the middle of august, its blazing hot and would of been nice to have the swimming pool to relax in in the evening. Not having a restuarant did cause us problems as we didnt particularly want to east pizza and pasta everyday of our stay. I am aware that that is an italian stable food, but being from London i am very use to multiculturalism and having a variety of foods and supermarkets to hand. The location of Hotel Aureliano is not the best as there wasnt much around apart from a mc d's near the metro station and a kebab shop also near the metro station which is roughly a 15 min walk. And in the sun with temps of 30c+ in the shade, it wasnt the easiest of things to do. Once you make it to the metro station (Cornelia) traveling to the centre of rome is quite easy. Buses are more tricker and we stuck to metroing it around For ease and convenience with parents who are getting on a bit i would not really recomment Hotel Aureliano as an ideal located hotel. If you dont mind staying out of the hussle and bussle then maybe this is for you.

It is also towards the end of the metro line, several stops outside of most of the tourist attractions. This makes it difficult to stay out in the city until too late in the night as you can miss the last Metro and have to take an expensive cab ride. Also, you may not be comfortable walking 10 minutes in the dark at midnight. As far as the hotel is concerned, the staff was friendly and let us check in early. There was always at least one staff member at the front desk who spoke English. Breakfast was included in the price and we took advantage of it. It was mostly cereals and breads, but they also had yogurt and hard boiled eggs. The room was small, consistent with most European hotels. It was kept very clean and we had a small balcony that looked out towards the city. No complaints on service, cleanliness, etc... We would most likely not stay here again, but only because we would like to be in the heart of the city and experience all Rome has to offer after dark.

In my opinion it's too far out of the centre of Rome for a relaxed sightseeing holiday. We booked our three night break last minute though Expedia and didn't do much planning or research before going which we regretted once we got to Rome and couldn't find the hotel. I only had the directions provided by the hotel and a guide book which weren't adequate not knowing Rome. We got the train from the airport to the Termini train station and then the metro to the Cornelia stop but then we couldn't find the bus stop and were lost so I had to go into a shop to ask for directions the shop owner called us a taxi but we ended up getting charged 15 euros to go round the corner! We paid it as we were so glad to get there but even if we had found the bus stop we still wouldn't have known where to get off the bus as the hotel does not have much of a sign outside and it's on a busy main road. I found the hotel itself to be ok, our room was clean and the bathroom was fine we also had two double beds in our twin room which was good. The breakfast was good and there was a lot of variety but the concierge wasn't very helpful. It's freezing at night in March in Rome and we couldn't figure out how to turn up the heating but asking the concierge seemed like it'd be more trouble than it was worth. I don't know if he didn't speak much English or had an attitude problem but he wasn't very helpful. The nearest restaurant to the hotel is a chinese, when we asked for a recommendation for a good restaurant we were given a bus map and told to get three buses to the La Trastavere area! We tried it but it was complicated and nerveracking, La Trastavere is a nice Covent Garden like area but two out of the three restaurants we ate in there weren't that good. We then had the problem of getting back to the hotel as we couldn't find any taxis and the buses stop running at midnight. We ended up having to get off the bus at the second bus change on the way back and walk about a mile to the hotel in the freezing cold this happened twice during our stay which really tried our patience. The area is urban and was fortunately pretty quiet but as we were two females in our twenties perhaps it was not the best suggestion by the concierge. On our last night we found the taxi rank in La Trastavere and were only charged 8 euros to the hotel! During the day time we got the bus to the Cornelia metro stop and the metro to the main sites which was ok. We had a good time in Rome despite the location of the hotel and soon became accomplished Rome public transport users. However I definitely would not stay at this hotel again or recommend it for sightseeing in Rome due to the location. I would not book flights and a hotel again through Expedia either. At the time we booked we thought our three night break was a bargain but we had interconnecting flights, flew into Rome Ciampino airport which is not the nearest airport to Rome and the location of this hotel was far from ideal. Given hindsight I think we should have checked the details more closely as I think it would be a lot cheaper to do some research and to book flights and hotel separately. I recently went to Venice for three nights and flew with Ryanair and stayed in a really central hotel that was lovely which I booked separtely and paid less in high season than for the break in Rome in low season.", "Date": "August 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norfolk, VA", "Title": "\u201cVery Accomadating\u201d", "Author": "l0vet0travel2007", "ReviewID": "UR7924639", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel upon arriving in Rome for a three night stay.

As the construction site next to the hotel had its cribwork extended very close to the room window on the first floor, my mom feeled extremely unsecure so swap room with me. Thus we asked the staff if we could change for another double room on the next day. The guy there seem nice and polite and promised for the change and assured he would leave a message for the staff next day. We double check this when we left hotel in the morning and everything was fine. But when we got back, a lady manager Ms Tiziana Colucci's attitude was just terrible. She insisted that she never heard of anything nor see any message about our request, and that their rooms were fully booked so she could do nothing about that. When we told her we noticed her talking to 2 people searching for hotel saying 2 double rooms still available, she got annoyed and said whether they really have available rooms was another matter and her hotel never change room for customers because of these reasons. And also we didn't talk to her directly the day before(but she's not there?!) , so she's not responsible for the change. The funny thing is that she said she was the manager and the guy staff wasn't and had no right to say about changing room. But do they expect a customer to differentiate whether a staff have the responsibility of doing what? And is it expecting them to pass on a message among the staff so difficult? We said we would like to make a complaint and she said we have made advance payment to Hotels, so please complain to the agent, not her hotel! Interesting! Finally we never met the guy staff again and couldn't chase about the missing message. Actually not chaging room is not a big issue, but just the bad attitude of the staff can really ruin your stay. When checking out, we asked that lady manager if we can have our passport copy back (they made copy of passports of every person staying when check in, i doubt it's a normal policy?) But the answer was really funny: \"sorry, we have thrown away the copies already.\" She can explain it's hotel policy to keep the record, but 'throw them away\" before customer checking out? what can i say, funny.

If you are not a frequent traveller, let me tell you: This is highly unusual. Normally, hotels may take your credit card details to secure the reservation, but they do not actually charge you before they have provided the service. Most times, there is no penalty if you cancel at least a day or two in advance of your stay. But not this hotel!!!

Pros: - great value at \u00a347 per double room per night (expedia) - friendly and helpful staff - very clean & modern rooms & bathrooms - reasonable breakfast - superb air conditioning Cons: - 10min brisk walk to nearest metro stop (Cornelia on Line A); this is not a pleasant experience with luggage in the heat. Get a taxi if you have luggage. - although the bathrooms are sparkling, the water temperature of the shower would alternate all the time, from cold to scalding. - we got trapped in the lift on arrival (!) and had to be let out by the receptionist.

We booked for 2 adults and 1 child through wotif. At 85 euro plus 10 for cot per night. When we arrived we were asked if we wanted to check the room as it would be very tight with a cot and we would be better with our son sleeping in the bed. We agreed and after travelling for 6 weeks had got used to occasional sharing with the 2 year old. We were a little disappointed that we weren't informed before we arrived. The room was very small even for just two people. We had other problems such as the metro being further the we were lead to believe before we booked, staff not knowing where sights were that we advertised by the hotel as things to do when staying with them. Our car was not parked in a secure area as advertised when booking. But it was close to the airport and easy to get to. The real problem came when we decided to stay there the night before we flew to Singapore. We decided to stay there as it was close to the airport and we would be arriving late and leaving early.We booked again through wotif.com. A few hours later we received a email from the hotel informing us that they didn't accept children sharing beds with parents. I was shocked as they had suggested it last time. We were also told we could not have a cot in the room for our child. They were just cancelling our booking. When I contacted wotif.com we were told that the hotel told them they could not have us in the room for Health and safety reasons. The story changed after I informed them that we had stayed with them before in the same room and booked through wotif. We were told that our money would be refunded with no charge but when the credit card company refuned the money it was less than what we had paid due to there charges and conversation rate. We had also made our travel plan from Venice to Rome based on the fact of where we were staying. So when they changed our plans it end up costing us an extra 200 euros. Also since we were travelling we didn't find out about the cancellation until 2 days later. One other note I would not recommend the chinese restuart next to the Hotel. Both my Husband and I got food poisioning. Luckily our son wasn't eating that dish as well.", "Date": "July 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cPerfecto! :)\u201d", "Author": "kristlosa", "ReviewID": "UR3557737", "Content": "My girlfriends and I stayed in this hotel for three nights and it was awsome! it is a little bit out of town, but the standard of the hotel was something really amazing.

First of all, whether it was our deal through wotif.com for 85 euros per night that has us relegated to the annexe down the side, I don't know but the rooms down there were miniscule. There was no bathtub as mentioned in the specs, and the shower was pathetic. No pressure and governed by usage from other residents - in other words, one minute it was hot the next cold. The loo wouldn't flush properly and no luxuries such as the bathrobe mentioned in the specs! The airconditioning sounded like my extractor fan in the kitchen and it was impossible to sleep with the thing on. When we callled someone from reception, they did oblige us with a visit, but after a brief inspection declared the noise level to be normal. I defy anyone to sleep in a 70+ dB racket! Breakfasts were average, uninspiring, if not poor. Coffee yuuk!! If I didn't know better, I'd say it was instant. For Italy that's sacrilege! The hotel is situated on a VERY busy road and the walk from the metro is sufficiently long to make it just a little too inconvenient in terms of location. Plus the Metro to that particular station closes at 9pm every night due to ongoing repairs to the line, so your'e forced to return home in the evening on the bus anyway. Don't bother choosing this hotel if you're after a quiet romantic spot in Rome. Hotel Aureliano is far from any of those. I've stayed in far better 3 star hotels with worse facilites and far more enjoyed the experience.", "Date": "June 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for great price!\u201d", "Author": "ovaltinemaster", "ReviewID": "UR3519017", "Content": "I read the wonderful reviews about this hotel and decided to try it out. Let's just say I wasn't disappointed. The hotel was modern, clean and comfortable. The rooms were adequate in size with all the furnishings expected for any decent hotel. The bathrooms seem newly renovated and most importantly CLEAN. The air conditioning was functioning and kept the room at the right temperature. The breakfast was great, with scrambled eggs and fresh fruits highlighting a wonderful meal. Do get there early as the eggs do run out quickly. The dining room staff were polite. Unfortunately there were a few short-comings. Some of the desk staff were rude and unhelpful, which seems to be common at Italian hotels. However, one of the more helpful staff did provide me with a great map of the city. There is no storage room to hold your luggage if you show up at the hotel earlier than the 2 pm check in time. They just told us to leave it at the hallway, and it was up to us whether to guard the luggage or to leave and to hope nobody else takes it. This hotel is a bit far from the Centre of Rome and gets a bit seedy at night, but it is about a 15 min walk to the Metro station. Overall though I had a wonderful stay at this hotel and if you don't mind travelling for a bit on the Metro to get the the centre of Rome, I would recommend it.", "Date": "June 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Constanta, Romania", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3517032", "Content": "The best place to stay in Rome!

If your looking for something traditionally Italian then dont stay here but if your looking for somewhere modern, clean and comfortable then I recommend it. The breakfast whilst not being awesome (as previously described) was substantial and the staff very helpful. One helpful hint, take your own travel adaptor as the hotel does not provide this. At the time of booking we had checked on Tripadvisor for reviews and at that time there was only one, which was extremely helpful, especially in advising of the website wotif - we paid 75 euros per night - bargain.

You see that the hotel was renovated recently into a four star hotel, so it has all the things that are required for 4 stars hotel. But it doesn't have anything esle!
