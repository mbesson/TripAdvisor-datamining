The hotel location is great: 2 minute walk (up a ridiculously steep hill!) to the California line cable car, 2 minute walk downhill to the other two cable car lines, 10 minute walk to either Chinatown or Union Square. The street the hotel is on, Bush Street, is very pleasant, and there is a good grocery store right by the hotel, and dozens of restaurants within a ten minute walk. I am happy we didn't choose to stay immediately around the Union Square area, as it is too loud and busy for our liking; the fact that we were a few minutes' walk from the it was actually an advantage. Breakfast was simple , but tasty: toast, muffins, some scones (yummy!), boiled eggs, sliced cheese (which was very tasty!), peanut butter, tea, coffee, orange juice. Staff were overall unintrusive and efficient, check in and checkout were very quick (as we had no extras to worry about ). There were a couple of staff members we saw most of the time - a young man who was efficient if slightly disinterested, and a lady with short blond hair who was absolutely lovely. WiFi in the room wasn't the greatest, but it just about worked, and there were two computers for the guests' use on the first floor, which also had a lovely sitting area.

My room didn't have much of a view, looking straight onto another buildings brick wall, I didn't mind as I was hardly there, I'm not sure if all the rooms are like that, you can probably ask when you make a booking.

The hotel's location is excellent; it's just a short walk to the cable cars, Union Square, Chinatown and Powell Station. It's also a quiet area with a corner store right next door and a laundromat just a few stores down. If you're looking for convenience without being smack in the middle of the hustle and bustle, this is the hotel for you. The rooms are fantastic; I simply ADORE the two walk in closets provided in my room. So much storage space helped kept the room clutter free. The beds are comfortable and warm. The mini kitchenette was a nice bonus; there's a fridge, a microwave, sink, plates and cutlery. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room rates include a continental breakfast which are basically assorted pastries, tea coffee, juice and hot chocolate. I suppose eating only cookies, muffins and bread can get quite tedious if you've an extended stay but again, the hotel's location allows for one to simply find breakfast elsewhere.

Cost and location were big influences in making the reservation. We expected something \"decent,\" but for the most part it was a pleasant surprise. The staff were incredibly helpful at check-in and throughout the stay, giving tips about the surrounding area including where to park for cheap (the hotel does have some limited parking of its own but there is a fee). Our hotel room was on the top floor, facing the next-door residential building so not exactly a room with a view (unless you're a voyeur) but the windows were screened and a nice breeze came through with them open. There was some noise from people living in the other building (and perhaps other hotel rooms with open windows) but not disturbingly loud - we had no problems sleeping. The building/rooms are old but partially remodeled - nice carpet and tile, LOTS of closet space, spacious bathroom, kitchenette area with microwave and minifridge. Quaint murals throughout the hotel, including in the rooms (rooms are named based on landmarks in the city, with a matching mural in the room). We had a \"deluxe queen\" room which was quite spacious with a small seating area, desk, and TV armoire. The rooms are not AC climate controlled (not unusual in SF) but with the fan and open windows we were quite comfortable (and there was a warm spell while there). Neither of us were impressed with the continental breakfast - mostly carbs and nothing mouthwatering. We had problems with the wireless internet not being available the first morning but after speaking with the front desk it was fixed and no further problems during the trip. The hotel is convenient to most of the downtown area and many public transportation options. It is a bit of a hike to the fisherman's wharf area but we did walk it one day and it was pleasant (though we rode back on the trolley).

I can't comment on public transport because we drove to the other locations but if you drive a compact car with side mirrors that can be folded in, you can park in their garage for free. If you have a bigger vehicle, you have to park it at a nearby garage for a fee. I did a thorough search on tripadvisor for hotels as we were travelling with a 10 month old and I needed a microwave and a refrigerator and this was only one of two hotels in downtown San Francisco listed on tripadvisor that provided both. They also provide plates and utensils and cups. An earlier review commented on the bathroom tiles but I didn't notice anything wrong with their bathrooms. Because the room and bathroom are very, very clean, I was fine with letting my baby crawl all over the carpet and bathing her in the bath tub. We requested for a room on the quiet side and it was really quiet. The service was also impeccable.

Check in was very quick and efficient and they even remembered that I was 'the Englishman that had asked for a quiet room'. The lifts are right next to reception and you are straight up to your room. The rooms were dated in comparison to some that I had stayed in during my road trip from New York to San Francisco but they were clean, big and comfy. There is a small kitchenette in each room but I didnt use it but I'm sure it would be handy for some travellers.

The area around teh hotel though is fine and no trouble at all. You are a 5 or 10 min walk to Union Square and from there you are into Chinatown. Ask ayt the reception to mark on the map Gant street as there is the oldest bar in SF called the Saloon and Friday and Saturday nigts it is rammed out as they have live blues groups on and the place is tiny ! There is a car park at the hotel butr if your car is bigger than a cigarette packet it wont fit. There is a car park within a 2 min walk that charges by the hour or day but I only had to park overnight as I was handing my car back the following morning. Breakfast was fine. Just what you needed.

I was very happy with this hotel. After reading the reviews, my expectation was that the Hotel Mayflower would be an older hotel with the feel of a bed and breakfast. As I entered, I was impressed with the comfortable, friendly and personable assistance and greetings provide as I checked in and throughout my stay. Hester (front desk) is amazing but all the managers made every effort to be as helpful as possible. The room I stayed in, their 'standard', was roomy and felt extremely clean at an unbelievable price for a mid-city hotel. I had a friend visit me during my stay who went so far as to check for dust on top of some of the pipes visible in the hallway-no dust-we were impressed. Hotel Mayflower opened in 1929, but it wears it age well. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the towels clean and more plush than expected even with the raves from tripadvisor reviews. The kitchenette area, also clean and usefully appointed included provided cutlery, plates mugs, and glasses. The tub in my bathroom was deep, and all was extremely clean to the eye and touch. The walk in closet was immense; about 6 feet deep and 4 feet wide-smelling slightly musty but not prohibitively. I was surprised. I loved the features in the room that spoke to the hotel's early days, the old no longer used gaslight features on the wall, the parquet floor in the bathroom, and the arched entry from the bedroom towards the door and bathroom. The sense of a well loved and cared for hotel also is evident in the decor of the lobby and the ceiling of the lobby. Check out the elevator, which is older-style lift, I especially liked how quiet it was, no blaring beeps. Other reviews made comments about things like grout on the tub that had some minor cracking--yes, I saw it too but I have seen less than perfect grout in many of the more modern hotels I have stayed in (Hyatts included) with that problem. The continental breakfast was satisfying. I was able to make toast with a variety of toppings, and either cheese or hard boiled eggs were available for those who want more protein. The coffee was hearty and the orange juice was good (definitely not from concentrate). I especially liked that there was a baked extra, like oatmeal raisin cookies, or muffins. The food is laid out in a room furnished with simpler tables and chairs but there was a plasma television and again, the place felt friendly. The neighborhood was quiet and absolutely no problem, about two blocks from the bustle of Union Square and very close to many forms of public transportation. The room was quiet, I had my windows and fan whirring constantly because I was there during the warmer fall weather and found the arrangement comfortable. The need to open windows might be a concern for those folks who have small energetic children and they should ask questions about window height if you stay during warm weather. Just as a note to those inclined to be surprised by no air conditioning: the lack of air conditioning is common for older hotels in SF. You want air conditioning at these prices, go to a Travellodge, or pay more and go to the more modern and expensive hotels. You lose something though; it is older hotels that give a visitor a sense of place and history. I like that. If I had a laptop the internet access would have been free. I was able to use computers availible to guests. I did not use a car during my stay so I cannot speak to the parking that the Mayflower provides. I wish I had pics of the murals on every floor of the staircase or the elevator. The ones attached a few views of the room, the lobby, and the guest sitting area.

This addition to the room was greatly welcomed as it meant that we could buy supplies and eat in the room instead of eating out all the time. We couldn't have been happier. Reception staff couldn't help enough and were happy to answer all manner of questions and reccomend attractions and routes to them. Breakfast is served downstairs at no extra charge and although it is limited, it is more than enough to set you up for a day. There was tea and coffee, fruit, porridge, toast, cheeses, juice and sponge cakes when we were there and we really did enjoy it every morning! The hotel has a grocery store just next door that is open til about midnight. This proved very handy for buying bits and pieces and the occasional late night bottle of wine! It is located in the Nob Hill area and is extremely well connected to the rest of the city. Walking distance to most places, we walked a lot and it was a great way to see parts of the city you would otherwise miss if you were on the bus. (An A4 street map is available from reception and it served us very well on our whole trip) There is also loads of bus stops nearby, most of which have route maps and timetables posted inside them. The hotel is a 2 minute walk from a cable car stop (Hyde Line) that will take you directly to Fisherman's Wharf via a few other landmarks. The cable car is not a fast or efficient method of trasport but it is good fun and worth a try at least once! The hotel is also a 5 - 7 minute walk from Union Square and all the shops which is handy but not great for the credit card :) I was worried about the area that the hotel was in because of its close proximity to The Tenderloin (About 10 minute walk) but we really liked the area and never ever felt unsafe, even at night and we had no issues with walking back late at night. The lady at reception gave us a map and kindly marked a cross on the Tenderloin area and advised us not to go there at night, we appreciated this extra thought very much!! We left San Francisco to visit Las Vegas and Santa Cruz and had planned on booking different hotels on each return but we liked the Mayflower so much that we re-booked each time.

The complimentary breakfast is served in a beautiful airy dining room, where I felt equally welcome to read the newspaper alone or chat with the other guests.

I have visited the city repeatedly over the past twenty years, and this is by far my favourite place to stay.", "Date": "September 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cQuaint but familiar...\u201d", "Author": "chankagirl", "ReviewID": "UR19605932", "Content": "I spent one night at this hotel in Oct 2006 and when I was returning to SF last month called to make reservations.No single or standard rooms were available so I was only able to get a room with a queen size bed for about 125.00 plus taxes a night. I arrived at the hotel around 1:45pm although check-in was at 3:00pm. The check-in process was quick and easy and I was able to leave my bag in the luggage room while I went to get something to eat. When I returned a few hours later, the room was ready and I was pleased. The room was clean and bright, had a kitchenette with a fridge ( which I made use of ), a microwave, glasses, mugs , cereal bowls and cutlery. The bathroom, although old, was clean, with sweet -smelling towels and fresh toiletries. During my stay I partook of the continental breakfast which consisted of orange juice, tea and coffee,butter, peanut butter, apple sauce, apples, cake, and a choice of multi-grain bread or white bread. It was self-service so you could eat as much or as little as you wanted. The breakfast was filling and a great money saver. The location is within walking distance to shopping, restaurants,and the cable cars.There is also a coin laundry nearby and a food mart next door. There was internet access in the room I stayed in as well as 3 computers for guests use, in the upstairs lobby area. The staff is friendly and helpful without being intrusive.

The location is fine, close to Union Square. The price is reasonable but then again the property is very old and it's not sensational value for money, just ok. The staff were all very friendly. Check in was slow but the bill was correct after the car-park charge was added so all went well there. The lobby was homely but i never received any information about the surrounding area or that 'introductory talk' you usually get, however brief. Having returned home i now have come to realise that there was a free breakfast included. I was never told my room included this. Unlike in the British Isles the breakfast is very 'continental' in US hotels. All you get is a bun and a cup of tea so it would hardly have killed them to included the breakfast for us. I thought this was a bit stingy or if it was an oversight it was a very bad one. The room was a bit troublesome. We had a good sized walk in closet and a very useful kitchette which was basic but clean. The room was a good size especially as we only had one double bed in it. Oh yes the bed. Are you extremely skinny? Grand you should be ok fitting two people in it so! It was the tiniest 'queen' i ever did see. Maybe it came from the Victorian Days when everybody was teeny. Two average people would have trouble fitting in it. No real problem, just ask for twin beds or a King. The curtains were the usual rubbish. No problem for me with sunshine however , as I was down a laneway and had a view into somebody else window of another building across . I asked for the quiet side so thats why i got that room so i didn't mind. Free wireless was a good feature if you bring your laptop. Hotels in Vegas wanted to charge this as extra so fair play to the Mayflower, they have it completely free for unlimited time. In fact the cheaper the hotels the more generous they were with wireless. The hotel is old. Very old. The lift is old. The carpark is older. It cannot accommodate big american tanks. They ask you 'is your car big'. Unfortunately our hire car company gave us a big 4x4 that we managed to scratch on the walls of this carpark even though the guy working there tried to help direct us out. And were not talking wing mirrors, were talking the body of the car, thats how tight it is. The wing mirrors have to be folded in.The driver is experienced and had been driving the car for a week. Now seriously i cannot reccommmend anybody with a car book this hotel. It is RIDICULOUS. They need to come up with an alternative place to park the cars or else park it somewhere else yourself and dont avail of the hotel car-park. Its 20dollars? i think anyway. Thats my advice.

This past October, I traveled with a friend to San Francisco during the Canadian thanksgiving week-end and what coincided in San Francisco as Fleet week. The Blue Angels flew over the city a few times which was quite neat, although the public transit system downtown was overwhelmed, especially the cable car. Fact was, we learned that after booking our plane tickets and we were left hanging to find a decent hotel at a decent price. We're both university students in our early 20s and I'm pretty well traveled. Usually, I tend to select slightly plusher accomodation (thanks to a good job despite the student status), in the likes of Marriott, Hyatt, etc. Due to rates at 300$+ with limited availability, we booked the Mayflower for a night at 125$ for a \"Superior room\", 45$ more than their standard room, but that would apparently afford us a room higher up and with a view. Given how many people mentionned noise problems, we decided to upgrade. Bottom line, I have a good connection and we were lucky to move to the W for the last two nights. I'll break down the review in two sections, positives and negatives. POSITIVE: -True to the reviews here, Nancy, the owner, is a very nice and helpful lady. A younger Spanish speaking woman working that night was also very nice. That can't be said for the rest of the staff we encountered. -Hallway carpets looked brand new and so did he hallways in general. I agree, everything must have been painted quite recently. Room carpets looked maybe a little older but were still very clean. -Old style elevators but remodeled. -Very nice lobby, front desk and charming breakfast room with a very good continental breakfast included in the room rate, comprising breads, cereals, fruits and coffee/tea/juice/milk and finally yoghurt. -Plumbing related bathroom fixtures obviosuly brand new and no hot water problems. -Free WiFi a big plus. -Kitchenette with fridge and microwave helpful for longer stays. -Plenty of toiletries, including soap, shampoo, lotion and mouthwash. NEGATIVE: -The man who checked us in was a little sketchy and caught off guard smoking outside as we were walking in to register. They do not take credit card information at the time of reservation but will require payment at check-in rather than check-out, even when paying by credit card which I found odd. I asked to see the room first. I recommend you do the same. -Some staff members were rude, including the first gentleman who made the reservation for us over the phone. Completely disinterested. -The kitchenette's glassware was quite visibly unclean, the wine glasses in our room all had either lip gloss or fingerprints on them. -We did not think not having Air conditioning was going to be a problem early Oct. in SFO but given our room faced the sun all afternoon, it was stuffy in there. We therefore kept the window open and it was VERY noisy as a result, despite facing the back. The room did not cool down much before around 3 am when a bunch of drunks yelling woke us up.and we decided to close the window. Ceiling fan helped a bit but I get congested when sleeping with that running so shut it off in the middle of the night. -My bedspread and pillowcases had old blood stains on them. -Room cleanliness was so-so with dust clearly visible in corners and our walk-in had a stench which prevented from storing any luggage in there. -Bathroom, other than fixtures, is clean but old and the shower head as a result came right around the level of my forehead. I'm only 5'9. You can imagine my 6'3 friend had a lot of fun washing his hair in the morning. Took forever given the weak pressure. -The alleged view was pretty much non-existent, our room, despite being on the 5th floor, overlooked neighboring buildings that obstructed most of the view. -Mattresses are brand new (according to their tags) but both me and my friend found them uncomfortable due to firmness. This is more subjective though. -I would disagree the location being good or great. The neighborhood was not re-assuring at night. I would not walk there alone and I'm a guy. Not much around and pretty much everything requires a steep walk downhill or uphill, making transit use mandatory. Union Square is a good 10-15 minute walk. Bottom line, the location is O.K. Nothing more. Would I return to the Mayflower? Possibly If nothing else was available. Based on what I experienced, I can understand why people on a budget like it. It's a roof over your head with a breakfast included. I also thought the 45 additional dollars for a higher floor room was a waste of money, given the rooms lower were described on the phone as being virtually identical. The said view was non-existent and the room, just as noisy as that 80$ room probably was. I probably would have felt I got a better bang for my buck with that room type. If looking for a place to sleep that's relatively clean and safely guarded, accessible by public transit to most of SFO's attractions and cheap, the Mayflower will do it. If you're like us and like your comfort and convenience location-wise, they are wiser options.", "Date": "December 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beijing,", "Title": "\u201cVery good deal and very friendly!
