Since my flight doesn't depart until 5:30, I thought I would still have time to wait... boy, I was wrong. I waited until 3:25pm and there was still no shuttle. I asked the receptionist again, and he told me to sit and wait in a Lexus SUV parked right outside the main entrance. I waited another 10min in the cold inside the SUV, and was getting really frustrated at that time. I went back to the hotel and asked the receptionist again to see what is really going on. Then he phoned the manager and the manager came and drove to the airport. No explanation or apology was given.

I get there, check in and go to the room and it was just not what I was expecting and let me tell you the pictures online are deceiving! It stated on bookings.com that you could cancel by 4pm so I didn't think I would need to use this option. I mean its not the most top notch hotel but at the same time, its NOT what I wanted and expected when I got in. Within a minute or so I call and ask the receptionist if I can cancel the room and she said I would have to speak to a Manager since I already checked in. Fair enough - I speak to who I think is a Supervisor and I explain the situtation; I have been there less than 5 minutes, I booked online, its not what I was expecting etc. He starts raising his voice and tells me he does't give a damn, I should have not checked in. I said well that's why I am calling and have been here only 5 minutes. He kept saying he doesn't care and he can't help me and I would get charged the full amount. I was so shocked to find out that he wasn't the supervisor but the Owner. How does an Owner speak to someone like that? I was so disgusted by it and decided to pay the $100 he couldn't part with and went somewhere else. I went downstairs and he didn't even speak to me. If he had spoken kindly to me on the phone, I may have reconsidered but for $100, he is now going to have m tell my story to over millions of people. Service is crap, the owner is utterly rude and the room sucks. I would NEVER go there again if my life depended on it. I just can't understand why the Owner was shouting when I was speaking so calmly and trying to explain why I wanted to cancel and he didn't want to hear any of it. Can you imagine if you stayed there and something went wrong, or you needed something, or had an issue. Good luck getting anywhere with someone like that...horrible. Ifhe is like that; I can only imagine what he has trained his employees to be like. And to represent Days Inn....forsure I will be writing to head office as well.

They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to be modern or fancy, but they do have to be clean. We had a concern about the cleanliness of the beds in our rooms at this hotel and trying to resolve the issue after-the-fact was a very frustrating and extremely disappointing experience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of the worst customer service experiences I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had in my life! In April we travelled to the Caribbean for a week with friends and left their car at the Days Inn Toronto Airport before our trip, with the intent to stay overnight when we returned after a late flight. We chose the Days Inn because the price was reasonable and we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting a 5 star hotel. When we arrived we were very surprised that the lobby was recently renovated; everything was shiny and new and appeared very nice. We had pre-booked the airport shuttle and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any issues getting to the airport. On our return, we landed at Pearson at 2:30am, it had been a long day of travelling, the weather was crummy and we were really looking forward to a few hours of sleep before driving home in the morning. We checked in sometime around 3:30am. When we entered our room we first noticed how everything (bathroom fixtures, carpet, furniture, etc.) looked brand new, but then we noticed the lights were already on, there was an open phone book on the coffee table and the bed had been turned down unevenly. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look right, it seemed that someone else had been in this room already, so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t touch anything and called the front desk right away. The staff member at the desk agreed that the bed shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be turned down already, apologized and brought us a key to another room within a few minutes. This was not a problem. However, once in the 2nd room, as we were getting ready for bed, our friends called from their room down the hall to say they had turned down their bed and found what appeared to be SCABS and BLOOD droplets on their sheets! They were really upset about this and said they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d prefer to just drive home, despite being exhausted. We then checked our bed and found 2 small spots, also looking like blood - near the pillow. My friend advised the front desk that he was willing to pay for the parking, after all, the car had been there for a week, but that we expected to be refunded for the rooms. Again, the man at the front desk apologized to us. He advised that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the authority to refund the rooms, but that he would let the manager know about it the next day. Once hearing that we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to be refunded, we asked the front desk man to return to the rooms with us; we wanted him to see the condition of the beds and we wanted to take pictures. He did this and my friend took pictures. We left at 4am, only 30-40 minutes from when we had checked in. We stopped for coffee and drove 3 hours home. The next day, my friend and I each called the hotel and spoke with the manager, explaining our concerns. He did not even apologize for our experience. He said he was going to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153investigate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and he would call my friend back the next day. He did not call back the next day, not even after I called to follow up with him. In fact, it took a WEEK, after leaving several messages with other staff members and finally a phone call to register a complaint with a 1-800 customer service number, before we ever heard back from anyone at the hotel. At that time I was told it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blood, but maybe ketchup or chili sauce on the sheets, which I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe. I was offered 50% off a future stay, which I thought was ridiculous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c blood or hot sauce aside, the way they had handled our concerns up until then was completely unacceptable and for that alone I would never return there - not even for a free stay. Besides that, even if it was ketchup on the sheets, it still means they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clean. I said that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want 50% off a future stay, but I expected a refund. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay there because the beds weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clean, not because we changed our minds or wanted to drive all night long. I was told that he had to consult the manager, but I would get a return call within 24 hours. Of course, no one from the hotel called me back, again. I had to call back several days later and after another very frustrating conversation, was finally told that they would refund us only for 1 room - not the room with the parking (which was my friends\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room, and actually the one that had the most stains on the bed and was the reason we left the hotel). We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve moved on \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was never about the money, but about the principle of it. Other than the man who was working the front desk that night, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m extremely dissatisfied with how the other 3 managers/staff members I spoke with handled our concerns and I will continue to tell every person I know who is looking for an airport hotel to NEVER stay here. Even if the problem we had with the sheets was a 1-time thing, (maybe the housekeeper was having a horrible day?)

In order to get from one area to another, you often must lug heavy luggage up and down floors and for long distances. Compounding these problems is a real shortage of working phones and few information booths. From past reviews, a reviewer mentioned the need to phone the hotel to tell them of your arrival to arrange a shuttle service. Don't bother. Despite knowing how difficult it is to get a working phone in Pearson, the hotel steadfastly refuses to book a shuttle in advance to meet you. They insist that after you land, you must first call them and wait 20+ min (not good in the cold or if you are there for a few hours of sleep). If you find a charge card phone (and don't have a card as you are a foreigner), don't call collect - their clerk Raoul refuses to accept charges. Thus, you must trudge with your heavy luggage around to find a working phone or information desk and then trudge back to the hotel shuttle point. Often, the shuttle bus does not arrive which necessitates a second trip. The next morning, don't expect anything much better. The driver was late and, to save time, dropped everyone off at Terminal 1, regardless of our protests. Another long trudge with heavy baggage until you came to your correct terminal - not good if you have a short time to catch your flight. How a hotel can screw up a simple shuttle service, even if contracted out, is beyond me. I would rather spend a few more dollars and catch a shuttle that does not need calling and comes regularly (Best Western, Holiday Inn, Sheraton)- at least you will arrive in time for a good night's sleep.

The front lobby no longer looks like a seedy downtown Chinese restaurant. A much more cleaner feel now. The rooms were clean and amazing. I have no complaints. The service was excellent too. The only thing I did not like was the fact that they required a $200.00 deposit. This was not mentioned at the time of booking. My wife and I were taken by surprise. Still it is just a deposit and we did get our money back so not too bad; just could've done without the surprise. Also, when it came time to leave they made us wait as someone went and checked our room before they gave us back our deposit. That definitely made us feel like criminals. I've stayed at many hotels and this deposit/room checking business was definitely a first. I would recommend the hotel for the price, cleanliness, and staff...the awkward check-out...not so much.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guelph, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBang for your Buck!\u201d", "Author": "sometimestraveller82", "ReviewID": "UR92468323", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this hotel during the holidays as a mini get-away. We chose this hotel because it is literally 2min. from the Woodbine Race Track which is where we spent most of our time. The rooms were clean and almost looked like they had recently been updated. I could smell new carpret smell as soon as I entered the room. The beds were nice and firm, coffee was free in the rooms, Internet access was free which was great for me as I often have to check work emails. Worth the price I paid I would reccomend this to anyone. Friendly staff too!
