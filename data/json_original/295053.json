Rooms and facilities look nice, above standard for hotel of that type in Turkey. Our favorite parts were excellent indoor and outdoor pool. A word of warning: please note that you have to wear swimming cap for the indoor pool. If you don't have one - you have to buy it (although the stated price is 5 TL, they charged us 9 TL?!) in the spa area. Breakfast is pretty standard for Turkey, buffet without pork, but with some excellent dairy products. Contra: The staff was inadequate for a hotel of this standard. First when we came to check in, they gave us a stuffy and dark \"smoking allowed\" room, even though we specifically asked for a non smoking one. It took them 25 minutes to find us a substitute room and when they did - it was one class lower then the one that we paid for. At least it was a non-smoking, so we accepted it. Later, we found a hotel's \"pillow menu\" (they pride in having this), but when we asked for a latex pillow from that same menu we haven't received anything for half an hour). Then after calling again, a man came - bearing the same (ordinary) pillow that we already had. So we called again and explicitly explained what we want. They said OK and there was a d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 vu - same guy came with another pillow of the same kind. We kept calling and trying to explain, but with the same result. Long story short - they kept bringing us ordinary pillows every time, so by the end of the evening we ended up with 8 pillows. Don't get me wrong - we're not snobs, and the point was not in the latex pillows, but in the facts that if you offer something very clearly, in printed menu, in every room - your employees should at least know something about it.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amman, Jordan", "Title": "\u201cPleasent stay, But....\u201d", "Author": "Zaina F", "ReviewID": "UR119352752", "Content": "Clean, good Located, Small Rooms, very Small Bathrooms, un-isolated rooms we could hear every thing on the next rooms even the small sounds, even the smoking smell was inside our room Most of the staff are very nice and helpful but one of the recepcienist guy (night shift is really rude and not helpful at all, and this should be taken into the manager consideration) as it will affect on the hotel Breakfast Menu was low class and shouldnt be rated as 4 stars delux hotel.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cSmall Rooms and Slow service but good location\u201d", "Author": "Ali H", "ReviewID": "UR119183965", "Content": "It was a trip for our honeymoon in Istanbul and we spent around a week in 3 different hotels and the Taksim Gonen was one of them.

Closing the window helped but the Air Con unit in the room was noisy and didn't really ventilate too well. All up, I would stay there again.

The hotel seemed ok at first, with a decent lobby and rooms. However, in terms of service and reliability they were terrible. It all started when I exhanged euros for turkish lira at the hotel reception (around 300 lira)- the problem was they gave me a fake 100 bill, which nearly got me into trouble when I tried to spend it, being of course unaware it was fake. When I went back to the reception they denied having given me fake money but in the end they exchanged the fake for a real bill after long negotiations with the manager. And then the real trouble came. We had booked the hotel online and had already paid for our stay when making the reservation. But at check out, they charged us for our stay again! I only realized when I got my credit card bill a month later. I sent several emails to the manager but never got any reply. So we ended up being charged twice for the room. I am never going back to this hotel and would advise everyone to avoid it. Be aware that the locals will always try to trick you so you must be alert at all times! If I went back to Istanbul, I'd rather stay in Sultanahmed area, and avoid taxim completely.", "Date": "July 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bahrain", "Title": "\u201ccouldn't complain until a neighbour checked in!\u201d", "Author": "BuDavid", "ReviewID": "UR16929698", "Content": "the hotel is very clean, service is good (even though the spoken english of the employees is very low but it is not a problem for me) the decoration of the rooms and the colors are nice, everything what a room needs is there.

Found reception good, though their communication skills in English sometimes let them down but they did their best and were very helpful. My room was on the tenth floor and it has lovely views over the city. Room was small but comfortably furnished. WC/Shower room was a little too small to be comfortable in and enjoy after a shower. Shower was awkward to use. It advertises a rooftop resturaunt however it wasnt there however you can still enjoy the great views over the city to the sea. Breakfast was a bit disappointing as the selection is more European than UK, so didnt eat much but there is enough that you can find something.
