I guess part of the problem is that the W brand caters to a certain clientele who is looking to have the lobby area turn into an ultra-swanky night club at night. It is to the point where if you are checking in at night, it's so dark in the lobby area that the guest services person writes the wrong room number on your key holder, it's so loud that you have to yell into the guest service person's ear just to be heard, etc. etc. Another things that struck me as weird is that when I checked in, I was asked to sign a document saying that I would list any \"roommates\" I may have in my room, that I would not be allowed to have more than four people up to my room at any one time, ... This just strikes me as strange for a hotel that costs $200+ a night. What I did l like about my room was that it was spacious, had plenty of light elements (lamps, shades, wall lights), had a huge curtain that I could pull across the bathroom/foyer to block additional noise coming from the hallway, the fact that I didn't hear the loud techno music coming from the club downstairs (some W hotels suffer from the fact that even if you are on a high floor it can be very loud), and the Bliss bath products. What I didn't like about my room (and was probably specific to my room) was that the AC unit did not work. Not a deal breaker only because the temperature was pretty mild in Dallas but definitely annoying as I had checked in so late and was too tired to make any complaints to fix the issue.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201c\"W\": Well-meaning whimsical watchtower with wacky washroom wedged within winsome weekend walkabout...\u201d", "Author": "Texman", "ReviewID": "UR127632938", "Content": "The wife and I decided to spend a much-deserved getaway weekend in Dallas. Securing tickets for the Dallas Mavericks for both Friday night and Sunday afternoon games, it made logical sense to choose logding closeby the American Airline Center(AAC). Located literally across the street from the AAC, the W Dallas Victory Hotel was a perfect fit. However, having never been to the W, we were somewhat puzzled by the whimsical design (refered to elsewhere as \"trendy\"); nonetheless a nice doorman finally recognized our disorientation and guided us to registration. We only made the Friday game tipoff in time because of the convenient valet parking and the W's easy walk to the AAC. Returning to our room, we analyzed our accommodations more closely. There was hardly any closet space whatsoever, hidden behind a mirrored door. My wife gave up and just lived out of her suitcase rather than to fight with me over the limited storage in the closet. The king-sized bed we requested precluded us from being assigned a room with a bathtub (as only double bed roooms offered tubs). The \"open floor design\" provided no separation between the bathroom facilities with its glass-walled shower space and the guest room itself. The shower had no door; consequently, there was a never-ending chilling breeze that continually swept across your wet naked body while using the shower space--making clean-up time needlessly unpleasant and necessarily brief. (Perhaps this is the W's \"trendy\" way to minimize water consumption?!?!) There were winestains(?) on the carpet, but overall the room itself seemed clean otherwise. The view via the outside windows was admittedly entertaining; however, it would have been even nicer if the exterior surface of the windows had been cleaned more recently. We did not attend the bar nor the hotel restaurant. However, we did meet friends at a nearby Moroccan restaurant that was excellent, within easy walking distance. There were several nearby shoppes as well that provided suitable momentary diversions as we strolled about Downtown Dallas. An unexpected pleasure was the exhibition in the AAC parking lot of the newly christened NASA space capsule dubbed the \"Orion\"! Two astronauts and several helpful assistants were on hand to explain the vessel's spacetravel features, offer complimentary brochures, mission patches, logo pins, and to sign autographs. Visitors were even allowed to sign the outside of this model, to show support for the continuation of space exploration. A very nice gesture of the hotel valet parking, understanding our purpose to attend the afternoon basketball game across the street, was to allow us to remain parked within the hotel valet parking even though we were required to check out of our room before gametime. This consideration was worth a star on the rating system by itself! We probably will return to the W Hotel in the future because we are loyal Mavericks fans. However, we will probably opt for one of the corner rooms that end in the numbers \"01\", as we were told these have an outside balcony and are constructed with a more favorable roomier layout. We'll update this review after we revisit, provided the Mavericks make the playoffs!", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cI think it's losing it's touch....\u201d", "Author": "JennyTucker", "ReviewID": "UR127531142", "Content": "I would like to start out by saying I am a HUGE fan of The Starwood Properties and always try to stay in a St. Regis or W whenever I travel. I WAS an even bigger fan of the Dallas W....having stayed there at least four times since it opened and even chosing to have my Bachelorette Weekend there back in September. I think it's losing it's touch..... I personally love the \"sparkle factor\" of the hotel. I think the spa with steam shower, pool, and overall feel is just fabulous. But upon staying there last weekend...something felt off. First of all...we were upgraded to a \"Spectacular Room\" for being Starwood Gold but it really was not much different than their base level rooms. The wear and tear is REALLY starting to show. Our mini bar was scratched up, there were multiple dings and dents in the wood furntiure, and it did not seem as though it was being maintained. Our hot/cold knob in the shower actually PULLED OFF in my husband's hand as he was attempting to adjust the water temperatue. My husband was also really surprised that the TV channels were not in HD which is something you would expect for a \"five star\" property. We encountered a few problems with our stay which also left a bad taste in our mouths......first of all the remote control didn't work. A new one was sent up promptly but still frustrating...the remote and TV also looked like they were very late models...think 1998..... Secondly on TWO occasions our room keys did not work. My husband and I both separately had to go down to the desk to get new keys made as we were told \"a cell phone or some form of magnetic strip\" deactivated the card. WHAT?! I have stayed at over 50 hotels in my life and have NEVER had this situation occur.....and have never been given such a strange explanation. Of course we are going to carry our room key in our purse, pocket, or wallet...which might also have our cell phone near it. So. Very. Strange. The worst part about when my key didnt work was I was on my way back from the spa wearing nothing but my white robe and slippers. IMAGINE my frustration coming back down to the front desk half naked to have a new key made. REALLY annoying! Other than those issues...almost everything else was fine...we used the pool...service was just OK in terms of getting drinks and food...the car service is nice and our driver was great...and probably the best service of the entire hotel....funny because I think the drivers are contracted out. I know the hotel was only built a few years ago...but I think it's time for a little TLC and a complete overhaul of their \"room key\" system. Sadly, this was my last trip to my favorite Dallas hotel. I will be at Zaza or Ritz from now on......", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bratislava, Slovakia", "Title": "\u201cVery trendy and great view from the bar\u201d", "Author": "SlovakKiwi", "ReviewID": "UR127263343", "Content": "For those that like W hotel style, you will most likely like it.

The Dallas location is one of the best.\u201d", "Author": "thecool272", "ReviewID": "UR123893286", "Content": "Excellent location, flawless service, beautiful rooms, amazing property and amenities, I dont know where to begin on how wonderful this hotel is. Ive stayed at a few of the W hotels across the country and this one is definitely one of the best. If your familiar with the Dallas - Fort Worth area metroplex, you'll see that the hotels location is perfect for business or pleasure. Located right on the outskirts of downtown and near uptown, its right by all major highways and access to other parts of the city and surrounding cities. Its literally right next door to the American Airlines Center so if your in town for an event, concert, or sporting game (Dallas, Mavericks or Dallas Stars) its absolutely perfect. You can walk across the street and not have to deal with traffic or parking. Located in the same block as the arena and also directly next door to the hotel is one of the news studios for WFAA Channel 8 where they shoot live news segments and shows daily so you may have a chance to get on tv sometimes or you may see one of your favorite artists or one of their special guests in the studio during the taping or airing of the show. All in all, that area is a pretty cool experience. Sometimes it feels like a mini times square when there is a really big event going on at the arena. Also surrounding the arena and hotel and really nice bars, lounges and restaurants, along with another upscale residential property so it stays pretty busy and upbeat. A good place for 20 to 30 somethings to enjoy themselves. Down the opposite direction of the street are a few more residential properties and small stores attached to the W hotel property on the block. At the farthest end of one of the W residential towers is the House of Blues, which is always jumping and is an EXCELLENT place for a live show or even dinner and drinks. There's also a Hooters right across the street from that (the biggest Hooters location in the nation. with the best looking staff, i might add) And there is also a brand new Hard Rock Cafe on the adjoining block to that. Which is massive as well and is a great spot for a business lunch or to catch a game on tv. Now, all that plus more I didnt mention is all in walking distance to the hotel so you can literally stay down there and do zero driving if your just in town for fun. Ive stayed there for a month last year and i think i took a cab once a week to a location in the middle of downtown for business meetings. Theres more restaurants within a quick cab ride away and the uptown area of dallas is nearby as well which is filled with trendy lounges, clubs, restaurants, stores, gyms, etc. Its the best part of Dallas with the most going on. Needless to say, the location is CHOICE! Your going to love it. The hotel itself is something to see. Its huge and is retro fitted with the standard W styling of super modern and extra fancy. Its got a slick lobby area and a sexy hotel bar called the Library Bar that has a trendy vibe and a really nice patio. They have guest dj's from time to time and sometimes do special happy hour events. Its a good place to go unwind before or after resting up in your room. The hotel has a top notch restaurant called Craft which is always amazing and never lets me down. I usually do my nicer dinners there then order room service if i need to and eat out in the surrounding places that i can walk to (hooters, hard rock, neros pizza, etc) If your into the club/lounge scene then this hotel will be perfect because on the top floor is the Ghostbar. Its the W hotels staple club establishment and is usually rocking the roof off. The only other ghostbar better than this would have to be in Vegas cause this place is amazing. If you've been to one then you know, they are nice. This one has a huge see thru patio on the outside with a bar attached so you can see straight down below while your hanging out up there. I think its something around 33 floors up in the air. Pretty sweet to see. The hotel amenities are all great. All that plus excellent room service (the food is actually really really good), an AMAZING pool area and wet deck, and a really nice gym, all makes this place basically a one stop shop for all your travel, relaxation, and party needs. Oh and i think there's spa on the first floor but Ive never paid much attention to it. Its past the elevators so when i arrive i usually just go straight to my room without going near the spa area. ha The staff is always impressive and does an excellent job at making sure the stay is an enjoyable one. Its strictly private access to the rooms so if you have visitors, the front desk will call you to either come down to meet with them or they will give buzz them up. Makes it pretty handy to limit traffic flow of people who may not actually being staying at the hotel. (noise, solicitation, etc) Lets see, the rooms! The rooms are always amazing and are SUPER comfortable. They are equipped with just about everything you will need and anything else you can just call the front desk and they will deliver it directly to your room. Ive ordered everything from an mp3 cord to plug in my mp3 player to the clock radio device, to a pack of cigarettes, to a 12 pack of beer, to a wine cooler. You name it, they will either already have it on hand or will get it for you. The beds are super comfy and come in standard queen or king sizes. There's a small chair or lounger in each room with a small desk, dry bar area, 32\" or 40\" flat screen, alarm clock mp3 ipod player device, 2 phones, and a nice separate bathroom area. The bathroom area includes toiletries, and a nice robe and linens. The rooms themselves always feel alot bigger in comparison to similar hotel chains around the same price. Ive stayed in both the double queen with 3 other people and the king suite just to myself and they always feel like i have a ton of room. Oh, they are also always super clean too. the bedroom area and the bathrooms are always spotless and look like they've never even been used. Overall, if your looking to stay somewhere nice and really do it up. Stay here. You get alot of bang for your buck and you'll never be disappointed. Its a rockin spot to stay and is definitely my go-to place in Dallas.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cAll-in-one place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "TexasTravelChic", "ReviewID": "UR123675482", "Content": "We love the W Dallas... everything you need, is in one place!

Then, it's quite love-less for a W, both service-and design wise, not very spectacular from the outside, not particularly special in the rooms. Our room was a fairly large and expensive one but it let us down on several levels that we wouldn't expect from a W, mouldy corners in the bathroom and toilet, left-over painter's tape on the shower head and a broken door in the wardrobe not allowing the thing to ever close properly. The worst bit, however, was the pool: Horrid atmosphere and full of drunk red necks having a party- besides the water was completely milky and yuck. Another issue as in most Ws was the so called \"What ever, when ever\" service that never seems to deserve its name: If you promise something like that, you surely should back it up at least to a degree? We followed the instructions found on a little card in a room \"If you want a coffee maker delivered to your room, simply dial the Whatever whenever button\". Yea- if it was so easy! First no one picked up. Then we were promised to get one and waited for 15 minutes. Called again, another wait. Finally received a free coffee from room service to make up for it but seriously: If \"what ever when ever\" can't do THAT, I wonder what they do if you ask for anything more than what would be expected anyway in a room of this price range? Not good enough but typical for Ws in general in our experience. Oh- one really good thing: The restaurant downstairs was absolutely lovely, great food and totally unexpected in this city.

The rooms are appointed with everything you would find in your own home, from down comforters to ipod docking stations as well as your own munchie station should you require a late night snack. My favorite though are the Bliss bath products. It's like having a spa in your room, should you choose not to make an appointment at their fabulous spa, Bliss. The only area of the hotel that seems to need a bit of brushing up is the coordination of the staff at the front desk. No matter what time of day I check in/out, there only appears to be one person on duty. Sometimes the wait can be more than I like, but I overlook it for the rest of the property is suberb.

The hotel was recently built (new construction) so everything at this hotel is brand new. As a Starwood platinum member I was upgraded to one of their spectacular rooms (which might actually be the same as a wonderful room on one of the upper floors). The room is not as big as you might expect, but the design is unique and they do a good job with the space they have to work with. The room is tastefully decorated with tall ceilings and the bed is one of the best in the hotel world. The lobby is amazing and very modern with plenty of seating and a fun bar off to the side. The fitness center is one of the largest I have ever seen at a hotel and is comparable to the Anytime Fitness I visit back home. The rooftop pool is worth a visit and is one of the best features of this hotel. They have an infinity pool above the hotel with a small pool bar off to the side. It lacks mid day sun since the W Residences are located above the pool, but they do get some good morning and afternoon sun for those looking for a tan. I need to give some props to the staff as they provide some of the best service in the industry. I can't say enough about how courteous and professional the staff was during my stay. I was very impressed that they were able to remember my name throughout the stay (and it was my first ever visit to this hotel). Housekeeping was wonderful and stopped by to clean my room at the time I requested.

The lobby etc was nice & the front desk staff were attentive at checking us in. When we reached our floor there was a cow hide sofa plonked outside the elevator that looked completely out of place...ie in shape & colour. Secondly there was certainly no wow when we entered the rm.the colour palette was plain-neither comforting, soothing or overly appealing from an interior design perspective. The cleaning of the room left a little to be desired.on opening the refrigerator there was a dark sticky stain all throughout the bottom of it...which the cleaners obviously ignored. Likewise with the do not disturb sign-it had a big grimy coffee stain splatter all over one side. One morning I even left the sign on the bench (grimy side facing up) & the cleaners still chose to ignore it & put it back on the door still dirty! The towels were thin & 2 of them had rips on the side salvage! Certainly not acceptable for such an expensive, supposedly luxurious, quality establishment as what you come to expect of the W branding! The room service charges were astronomical-some 20% fee\u00c2\u00a0+ 18% gratuity & then an additional $3 for delivery...give me a break! The Tavern a couple of doors down did the trick as did TGIF & hard rock cafe just a 5-10 min walk away. By the way there is also a gas station within 5 minutes away where u get snacks from too. One positive was the free dropoff service somehow linked/sponsored by Acura. The most challenging part of the experience reserving the car was getting some help from one of the female W staff...ie a city map, directions, local information, DART details etc....overall the staff could have been a little more consistent accomodating the guest & just generally being helpful & friendly!

The thing about the W hotels in general is their inconsistency; some are very clearly superior than others... and this discrepancy is also very clearly by design; its not that some of the hotels are incompetent, its that some are obviously designed to offer much more to guests. A great experience at one does not necessarily mean the same experience at all of them (and vice versa). Fortunately, the W Dallas has nothing to worry about in this regard, as it is frankly one of the finest in their portfolio (of which I have been to a great many). First off, it's a new construction, and seemingly no expense has been spared. The rooms are beautifully decorated and positively scream quality in every aspect, from the gorgeous bathrooms to the tastefully dark painted walls and contrasting faux-ostrich padded headboards that reach nearly all the way up to the seemingly 15' ceilings. I've had almost every kind of room in the hotel, and have not been disappointed with any of them, large or small. The lobby is amazing as well... the lounge area is gorgeous and spacious, with comfortable and luxurious seating and plenty of room to spread out (including a fantastic outdoor area), have a drink and some food, meet with friends or get some work done on your laptop. In the evenings there is often a live DJ and a crowd of very pretty people and is a lovely, low-key setting for a cocktail. On the other side of the lobby is the Craft restaurant, which is not quite as good as it's original NY incarnation, but still pretty great. Then again, Dallas has no shortage of excellent dining in general. The pool is also a highlight, located on a cutout section right in the dead-center of the building (on the same floor as the lovely Bliss spa); it's quite breathtaking, with an infinity edge that seems to go right over the side. The only drawback is that it may not be the best place for sunbathing due to it's placement... but on the other hand, direct sunlight on a summer day in Dallas can be pretty brutal, which I'm sure was taken into consideration when they designed the building. On the roof is the Ghostbar, which is kind of a letdown in comparison to all the other superlatives that the hotel has to offer. Maybe it's because I grew up in NYC and live in Manhattan, but I'm a bit of a nightlife snob, and Ghostbar doesn't quite live up to the standards to which I'm accustomed. Sure, it's worth going if you're staying in the hotel, and it's definitely considered a Dallas hotspot... but therein lies the problem. It's a fairly unsophisticated crowd, and the place was set up to cater to that clientele. The decor is pretty tacky and the giant platform space-boots they make the cocktail girls wear are more than a little ridiculous (as a side note, you will NOT find hotter cocktail waitresses anywhere on planet earth... so while their decorator should be fired, whomever is in charge of hiring those girls should be given some kind of medal). Its a shame too, because the space itself is completely breathtaking, with fantastic views and a spectacular outdoor section. With some redecorating, better promoters, and a stricter door policy, it could really be a destination unto itself. The hotel also has a staff who leave absolutely nothing to be desired. They are top-notch all the way. Literally a pleasure to deal with in every regard, from check in to check out. I have literally never had better service at a hotel anywhere else in the world. I cannot say enough good things about these people and their management... they all deserve raises, from the valets to the housekeepers. I've had numerous special requests for the concierge team, and they've come through for me with aplomb every single time... from renting me an exotic car to locating an obscure hair product, they've said yes to literally everything I've asked them to do, and did it with a smile. I've even left a shirt in my room and completely forgot about it until almost a month later... I called the concierge, who managed to track it down somehow, had it dry cleaned and then placed it in the closet of my room on my next visit. You do NOT get that kind of service just anywhere.

I have stayed at other W Hotels in the past and had extremely high expectations for this stay based on experience. When we got to our room, we were actually shocked at how much smaller it was than other W Hotels. Someone in the elevator actually mentioned it to us on our way up and said that this hotels rooms were a joke compared to other W Hotels - unless you book a room on a higher floor. Upon walking into our room, we immediately noticed a strong odor of urine in the room. We complained twice before we were moved (the first time, they sent someone up to spray a fragrance in the room to cover up the odor). The second room we were in had a malfunctioning lock. I found this out after leaving the room to get coffee the 2nd morning and I forgot my room key. My wife was in the shower, so I decided to try turning the door handle. To my utter shock and horror - it opened. I tried several times to get it to function properly and found that it did not work at all. Fortunately, we use the deadbolt and other locking mechanism when in the room through the night (as should everybody else). Telling the front desk about this issue resolved this problem without any issues. Another day, we were gone in the morning, and planned on coming back at around 3:30 or 4:00. We told the front desk so we could make sure our room was attended to while we were gone. Unfortunately, when we returned, our room was as we had left it in the morning. We called the front desk and told them to send up towels, as we would need to shower before leaving again. Over an hour went by without any towels. I called again and finally after 25 minutes got a knock on my door. It was the housekeeper there to clean the room. She knew absolutely NOTHING about the towels. We also had issues with the wall outlets during our stay. We could not get our cell phones, laptops, etc. to charge. We unplugged the alarm clock and still had no luck - waking up in the morning with dead electronics. We told the front desk about this problem the first morning and they said they would send someone up to check it out. The next morning, we complained again. We were told by the person at the desk that we were supposed to have the \"master\" wall switch turned on for the outlets to work. She said that someone should have let us know this when we checked in. Nobody did. Thinking we were missing the master switch on the wall, we turned on all switches the next night, sleeping with lights on and still woke up the last morning with dead batteries. Telling the front desk only got us an apology and offer to use the outlets in the bar. I've had some poor experiences at other hotels in the past and when I raised the issue, I was compensated with more than just an apology - a free night, a spa treatment, etc. This hotel would only offer a half hearted apology. Due to my experience, I emailed the hotel manager with pretty much the same as above. It took 5 days with no response before I emailed the corporate email address. Finally, on the 5th day, I finally got a response from the hotel manager's assistant. The response was nice and was filled with apologies. In the end, I was offered with an \"added apology from the hotel\" with 3,000 SPG points. In the meantime, I received a response from Starwood Hotels customer service and was given this response: \"I have reviewed your file very carefully, and do believe the compensation offered is fair. The Starpoints could be used towards a free night stay in most participating hotels worldwide (Please note, the number of Starpoints required for a free night differs depending on the hotel category). I understand this may not be what you were hoping for, but I assure you that this decision was based on facts and careful research. In accordance with our practice, your concerns have been addressed with the hotel General Manager. The file has been closed. \" I was not going to let this experience turn me off completely from W Hotels, but the email I got from Starwood changed my mind of that.

We called the front desk, and were informed that they were going \"green\" and you had to request to have the room made up...we were not informed of this at check in nor was there a card in the room regarding this policy. They did send up someone with fresh towels at our request. Additionally, the mini bar was never replenished but the ice bucket had mysteriously dissapeared, so someone had been in our room. After yet another call, someone arrived with an ice bucket. We asked to speak to the manager on duty. He did say it was their policy to not clean the roomsexcept by request because they were going \"green\". (This was puzzling, because the room was cleaned after the first night stay with no request) Other problems: After we arrived, I tried to access their wifi service , as I had on previous stays. I had to call the front desk (twice) for assistance. The third call they transferred me to Tech Support. The support agent had me change several settings in my computer, (about 15 minutes) he said he could \"see\" my computer but needed me to change some more settings and be on hold for awhile. I started to get a bad feeling about the whole thing, then opted not to continue, and went without my computer for the rest of the stay. I was stunned to see a $2 outgoing charge for the call on our bill. Obtaining a hot shower or bath was problematic, as the water in the tub/shower took almost 10 minutes to get warm and a then longer for hot. (hmm...not so green...)

Let's just say, I don't have $300/night to burn on a room...but if I did...I would prolly choose to burn it here. Ideal place for the sassy singles. Rooms were extremely comfortable, great views of the city, and excellent location for accessing nightlife. On Saturday night, we went to the Ghostbar on the 33rd floor...great music and we didn't spend a dime on alcohol since I would easily say the ratio of men to women had to be 4:1. The crowd there wasn't THAT spectacular, but sufficed. A couple of genuine creepy looking guys and eccentric weirdos that made us feel uncomfortable (I know this used to be quite the hotspot 2 years ago, cannot say the same now). Back to the room: the mini bar prices in-room were excessive, even by luxury standards. $13 for coffee? Are you crazy...but since we saw no starbucks within quick walking distance...boo. The pool on the 16th floor is insane...but if you are trying to sunbathe...eh, not so much! We went out there around 1:30 and had to get in the cold water and cross to the back corner of the pool to find some sun. This place is DEFINITELY geared to the singles, once again (which we were, but one friend had her kids). DO NOT take the kiddos to the pool after 3 pm on a weekend. Let me explain...this place is aimed to the partying late 20 & early 30 somethings....the crowd we observed at 6 pm much different than the noon crowd. Noon crowd is still on the safe side....but the later and later it gets....here comes the crowd that probably got home at 6 am, rather than 230am. This crowd also contains ppl that are on who knows what exotic designer cocktail drugs b/c we saw a couple having sex in the pool....yup! Oh, did I mention there were kids in the pool at the time & plenty of other ppl. Geez, this isn't Rehab Las Vegas! Go to your room! The pool isn't THAT big, so it is not like they were hiding. And if they weren't having sex, then hunny, they sure did a good job of fooling the rest of us. Anyways, I'll have to say there's another downside to this hotel...the location/neighborhood is blah! We chose to walk to the nearby dining options and it felt like we were walking in a ghosttown....I was waiting for a tumbleweed to flutter by....On a 2.5 block walk to the House of Blues and Hooters around 5 pm....we saw 0 other ppl walking around. what gives?!?!!? I'm from Austin...people are ALWAYS walking around outside...this is just weird to see so much desolation/abandonment. I couldn't even tell if House of Blues was open b/c there wasn't anyone parked in the lot...we chose Hooters, which had ppl, but still...so desolate! I imagine when the Mavs are playing across the street at the American Airlines center, that the place is alive, but at the moment....dead! Word from some locals is that this Victory Park area is losing money fast and that the investors are quickly selling their shares...shame, b/c it was a cool idea.

OH...parking situation sucks....$24 to valet? really? This is Dallas, not Miami, NYC, or LA.

I always thought they'd be crawling with wannabe hipsters and wannabe \"cool-kids\". I was also afraid of not getting a good nights sleep, thinking the hotel would be packed full of partiers late at night. Boy, was I wrong. The first time I stayed at the W was in August of 2009 with two of my girlfriends. From the moment we drove up, we were greated pleasantly by the valet staff and greeted kindly at check-in. They made us sign some kind of \"sweet dreams\" note that basically promised we wouldn't throw any parties that would disturb other guests, which was totally fine with us because we aren't those kind of people. We made it up to GhostBar one night, and that was...well...an interesting crowd. Not very \"high-end\". Just a lot of wannabes it felt like. In April of 2010, my boyfriend and I stayed at the W just for one night and had a great experience. Valet and the front desk were always extremely courteous and kind to us. The rooms are very cool and modern, not a whole lot of decoration. The beds are wonderful and so comfortable, I always slept like a baby. The shower was really nice as well. We never really had much of a view of anything but the highway. But honestly, when I go to hotels in a big city, I could care less to be looking out the window. The pool would probably be my biggest complaint. It's a completely covered area so you get zero sun. There are a few parts on the far edge of the pool, meaning you'd have to swim to get to it, that has a little bit of sun and those spots I'm sure are hard to get unless you get out there early.

The problem is that just because you have expensive hotels, expensive office buildings, and a state of the art arena does not mean it actually becomes a cool/hip/trendy place. Since Victory Park has not yet achieved this goal the W actually feels a bit out of place here. You can walk to the Hard Rock Cafe or Hooters but that is really it- if you arent going to a game the location stinks. The hotel itself is your typical W with a flew more flaws. For one the walls here are really thin. I have stayed at other W's on weekends and not been woken up by people talking in the hallways and slamming doors before. Also their housekeeping was inconsistent. One day they forgot to give me bath towels. Another day they forgot to give me soap. On yet another day they threw out my unfinished cashews that I bought from their mini-bar. Oh yes and this is something else.

This is the happy ending to that story that occurred at the W. I had a reservation at the W Hotel for four of us in the party because we were unable to get two rooms at the Aloft. After the Aloft was unable to find us another room, we got to the W around 1am and were welcomed by James at the front desk. I told him that I knew they were sold out, but that if anybody cancelled or didn't show up that night to please let us know because my parents were going to have to cram into our room on the floor because the Aloft gave away their room. He apologized profusely even though the W had done everything right and said that he would see what he could do. He then went to the back to check on something and came back to let us know that the manager said it would be ok for him to upgrade us to a suite so we would have more room for my parents. This must have been an emergency room they saved in case of problems at the hotel. The W did not have to do this, but they did and I cannot express how elated my entire family was with this. And this was no normal suite. It was an enormous suite, with a 6 person dining room and huge balcony overlooking the American Airlines Arena. On a sold out night before one of the biggest football games of the year, the W came through and I will never forget how well we were treated. My parents couldn't believe it either. They still live in a pretty small Texas town and they must have called everyone they knew the next day to tell them about the room and the view of downtown Dallas. The hotel staff even called the next morning to say they had rooms available if we still wanted to book one more for the second night and that we could use cash and points. So I booked another room for the second night for my parents to give us another bed. But the suite was excellent for that first night after we had all been travelling the whole day and it was so convenient for getting to the game the next day on the DART.

We have had better service and amenities at LaQuinta's! We arrived at the W at 4pm (an hour later than check-in), and we were told our room was not ready. The clerk gave us our room number so we could charge our beverages to the room and invited us to wait up at the pool deck for it to be cleaned. She took down my husbands\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cell phone number and promised to call when the room was available. On our way upstairs to the pool we decided to stop by the room to see if anyone was tending to it. We found ONE chambermaid working the entire floor, and at no hurried pace either. We could see our wait was going to be significant. Upon arriving at the pool deck we sought out the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153changing rooms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mentioned to us by the clerk for putting on our swimming gear. We were appalled to find this so-called changing room was a Uni-sex, single stall restroom meant to be shared by all 100+ patrons of the pool area. Needless to say, it was absolutely disgusting! At the pool we started to get a clear picture of the typical character attracted to the W Hotel; frat daddies and sorority chicks. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a single place to find a seat anywhere on the deck. The pool area had a cool layout, but unfortunately my husband and I never got to experience it first hand b/c of the hoards of people we were contending with for space. PS- they charged us $5 for and 8 oz. cup of beer and $11 for a 8 oz. margarita. We waited at the pool for 2 hours and never received a call, so we finally headed back to the lobby on our own. We asked the clerk at the front desk, now a different young lady than before, if our room was ready yet, she looked up our name and told us it was. WE HAD NEVER RECEIVED THE PROMISED CALL! When we told her that her response was, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why. We sent you a text message and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why YOU didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There was never any admission from her that a 2-hour wait, with no communication, was unacceptable! There was never even an apology! In her tone she even had the audacity to suggest it was our own fault the message hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been received. Incidentally, what kind of costumer service rep thought a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153text message\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would be the best way to communicate with the customer? How impersonal! Then, on top of this, the girl proceeds to give us information for a completely different room number than what we received earlier. Waves of distrust for the W\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reservation software, containing our precious credit card information, came flooding to our minds. Whose room had we charged our drinks to and how easy would it be for someone else to do the same thing to us? Why had we even received an incorrect room number? Did we truly receive an incorrect room number, or did the clerk pull the ol\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 switch-eroo because sadly the original room was still not available? All we do know for sure is that our first room was located at the very end of the hallway, where we could have enjoyed more privacy, and our new room was right, smack in the middle of the hallway where we had the luxury of hearing anything, and EVERYTHING that took place anywhere on our floor. The rooms at the W Hotel are a joke. You walk in and you are immediately in the bathroom. It feels like the dorms on a college campus. The hotel strives for a modern feel, but they used such cheap materials it ultimately feels contrived and desperate. It is evident that multiple corners were cut in the construction of this hotel. There is one outlet in the bathroom found tucked a foot from the floor in the narrow space between the sink and the shower. There is only one towel hook in the entire room. The closet space was obviously an afterthought; their own luggage holder couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even open the full span in the space within the closet. The lights in our particular room (#1421) were erroneously wired making it a guessing game each time you tried to turn off/on a light; sometimes one switch would work, but then it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to try another switch. The view was not at all \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Spectacular\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; we faced a giant construction site. The walls were paper thin and our particular room had a conjoining door to another room which you could hear everything through. It was like having a roommate! Yeah\u00ef\ufffd\u0152 Because of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quality\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd customer W Hotel apparently attracts, it was no surprise to us that at 2:15am we were rudely awaken by screaming drunk people streaming in from the bars. When sharing experiences with some fellow patrons the next morning we even learned about a couple of physical fights that took place in the hallway of the 8th floor between two different parties staying there. The valet service was literally the single enjoyable thing about this hotel. The guys truly had a heart for serving and seemed to enjoy their jobs. The wait was non-existent. They were very efficient. I guess the one thing W Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management has done right is contracting out their valet parking. I hate to think we wasted $280 on such a pitiful experience. I read that W Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in other cities have a much better reputation, but at this point I have such a terrible taste in my mouth because of W Hotel-Dallas, I doubt we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d ever consider staying at another W anywhere.

This W is not a Victory.\u201d", "Author": "FrontRowChicago", "ReviewID": "UR34587883", "Content": "We are discerning travelers who enjoy luxury, high end hotels. Having stayed in some of the best hotels in the world, we recognize our expectations can be somewhat skewed. However, the W name generally carries with it a solid reputation and, altough not exactly luxury, typically offers high quality accomodations. Starwood usually produces a quality product. We were attending a concert at American Airlines arena and chose the W Victory Plaza mainly for its location - it is across the street from the arena. The physical facility is new and the surrounding area is still developing. I guess the management decided to match the neighborhood and keep the hotel staff \"new\" as well. I don't think we encountered a singe hotel employee over the age of 24. Desk clerks, bellmen, valet, housekeepers, room service, attendants, conceirge - all were very young and very inexperienced. The best way to describe the staff is extremely immature. They had no grasp of customer service, were too busy consumed with impressing each other or making plans to \"hook up\", and generally present as a bunch of college kids who are using the hotel as their own country club. If management reads this, listen up: On the weekends, your hotel staff \"invites\" their friends to utilize the swimming pool and other facilities as their psudo country club. We're not kidding. Just stand out on the sidewalk and see how many kids are parking down the street and walking into your hotel - bathing suits on - to use your pool area. We know. We walked the block and saw the trafiic coming and going. We spoke with some of them, and some of your own staff. Your staff was more excited to welcome and greet their friends - who were not guests - than to welcome their actual guests. If you care, you need to get a handle on this quickly. In terms of the room, for a new building the room was very dissapointing. It looks like someone tried to create a luxury room in a standard room environment. Lowering the lighting and cramming in \"hip\" amenities does not make the room any more comfortable or luxurious. The design is terrible, the quality is poor, the mechanics are failing, it was not the cleanest, and worst of all the AC is completely inadequate. Our room NEVER got cold. Nada. Hot. That is not good for Dallas, Texas. The room reminded us of some of those \"re-do's\" where someone takes over an existing facility and tries to convert it to a more modern and luxurious location , but fails. What is puzzling is this is a new facilty. What happened? Way too many corners were cut. The Living Room (lobby bar) was fun after the concert and the room service was both prompt and, surprisingly, of very good quality. (I would bet the chef is experienced) However, we were shocked to be told there was no place to eat on the premises between 2:00 and 5:30 - not even a coffee shop or snack bar. That is unacceptable for a full service facility. Overall, we do not plan on returning to the W Victory Plaza and would not recommend it to anyone who typically enjoys staying a the Ritz, Rosewood Mansion, or other upscale locations. We also would not recommend this location to anyone treating themselves for a special occasion - you will be very dissapointed. As two professionals, we would absolutely not recommend this facility to any business travelers - this is NOT a business hotel.

The person at the front desk took it as a personal affront, insisting that the \"system says the keys work just fine.\" We were finally able to get him to reprogram the keys (he refused to do so until the fourth (!!) trip to the front desk. The second big problem was the noise in the hotel. Throughout the night, we could clearly hear people talking in other rooms, Additionally, there were people coming and going ALL night, talking, laughing, drinking in the hallway. We finally gave up at 4:00 a.m. and checked out of the hotel and headed home. Not surprisingly, there were group of boisterous people in the hallway, lobby and even hanging out by the front door, drinking. Not exactly what you would expect from this upscale chain. On the positive side, their beds are incredibly comfortable and they have an excellent fitness facility (our keys didn't work there, either) and a beautiful swimming pool. The room (we had a \"spectacular view king\") was adequate in size but not particularly large for a Dallas hotel. Oddly, there are no drawers or shelves for clothing and only four hangars in the closet. The wall safe did not work. The LDC television was fairly small (I've had bigger television in a Hampton Inn) but of good quality. The room was clean but the hallways / elevators lobbies were not. The view was good but hardly spectacular. Unless you are attending an event at American Airlines Center next door, there is very little to do in the area within walking distance. On the REALLY positive side, Craft Restaurant is a wonderful experience. Nothing about the meal could have been improved; excellent food, amazing service, good wine list.

We first had trouble with the parking garage across the street but I was told by the W that they were not affiliated with them so I will try to base my review mainly on the hotel. I had 7 people total in my group for my bachelorette party. We are in our mid 20's to 30's and not too high maintenance. The main reason we stayed at the W was for Ghostbar. We checked in arould 5pm (check in is at 3pm). I was told over the phone when making the reservation that they would try to get us adjoining rooms. Upon check in I was told that was never a possibility bc of the 2 queen beds we were getting and the layout of the hotel. It would have been nice to have been made aware of that when making the reservation but oh well. Ok so we had seperate rooms on the same floor. I was a little disappointed but ok with that. BUT they didn't have our 2nd room available yet. Again, check in was at 3pm. So we all went upstairs and got in our 1st room. The rooms were just ok. The TV was nice but I wouldn't say they were elegant or above average for the price of the rooms. By 5:45 we still hadn't gotten a call that our 2nd room was ready so I had to call down and check on it myself. They did send someone up with a key for the 2nd room at that point--but I shouldn't have had to call and the room should have been ready in the first place when we checked in, in my opinion! Later that evening we were going to go to Ghostbar. I was told on the phone that we could check in for our table from inside the hotel. They did have an entrance inside the hotel but when we got there we were told we would have to use the OUTSIDE entrance bc we had table service. Again, miscommunication on the hotels part. So we had to physically leave the hotel, walk around the corner and then go up to Ghostbar. We did have a great time at Ghostbar and really enjoyed ourselves there---thank goodness bc that was the whole reason we were staying at the W. When we checked out of the W the next morning I put the room charges on my credit card. When I looked at my credit card statement a few days later I noticed extra charges on there. Yep, you guessed it, the W put $45 of movie charges on there that we DID NOT get. When I called and told them this they did handle the matter promptly and told me it would be taken off my credit card. I haven't checked it yet so I hope they do follow through on that part.

The actual massage treatment was wonderful. The facility is terrible. #1 - There is no spa (jacuzzi, hot tub, whirlpool) anywhere on the premises. I have never been to a high-end spa that did not have both a spa and a cold plunge. Bliss in Dallas has neither. #2 - They will tell you they have a \"Steam Room.\" Well - not exactly. There is one single shower in the mens small locker room. In that shower there is a steam outlet which is basically worthless. If you turned it on today, it might generate enough steam to be useful in about 24 hours. It is not a \"Steam Room\" like one would expect in a high-end spa. #3 - The lounge area, or waiting area where you wait before your massage treatment does not contain a single lounge chair. You are sitting there straight up in chairs facing 12 foot glass windows overlooking West Dallas. Sounds really cool, but when you are trying to get relaxed before a massage it is the last place you want to be - especially after you have just found out they don't even have a spa to soak in! OH yeah - and if you are bored, you can read one of the magazines in the HEAVY plastic holders they use to protect them. At $150 for a massage, one would think they could afford to replace the magazines and lose the Doctor's office protectors!! In addition, the \"fresh apples\" in the lounge area had to be at least a week or two old. They were mushy and inedible. Nobody paid any attention to what you needed or did not need. No nice soft fuzzy robes or lavender scented neck wraps were in sight. (P.S. - go to the Ritz or Crescent Court for these treats!!) #4 - The music --- Someone needs to tell the W Management that blues music is NOT spa music. They play the same music everywhere - even in the massage treatment room. You are on the massage table attempting to relax while this female voice is belting out a blues tune!! NOT RELAXING at all. I asked them to just turn it off. Eclectic is one thing - relaxing it is NOT!! #5 - The actual massage treatment was excellent. The therapist was very professional and did a fantastic job!

I asked the woman booking our reservations if there was any way to get a discounted rate. She told me in a rather bored voice that she couldn't get it any lower, and that I should be grateful to get a room because they were almost completely booked up for the weekend. I argued with her that I had been in the hotel not 5 hours before to check it out, and had had the front desk clerk tell me that they were less than half full.

After threatening to get the manager, my husband finally got us checked in. The room was on the 6th floor, and looked out at the unsightly buliding rooftops. To make things worse, our room was not clean. The beds were unmade, towels missing, no soap, a huge stain on the floor, and a phone that didn't work.

In contrast to the stark and cramped early incarnations of W rooms, this suite was extraordinarily spacious, bright, and airy. The gargantuan two-rooms were furnished with ultra comfy velvety sectionals, funky office chairs, and the usual inviting W signature bed. The living room was so huge that it housed a dining room table large enough to accommodate a wedding banquet. Floor to ceiling windows with sweeping city views and streaming sunshine added to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153WoW\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd factor. Gadgets are the usual for a swanky ultramodern room including extra large plasma TVs and space-age phones. I found the glass-abundant bath room motif chic and stylish but would have to agree with previous reviewers that the layout leaves little privacy for the occupant and even less to the imagination of roommates and service staff. Best extra-room amenity is the very well kept fitness center with, unlike most hotel gyms, actually enough room, weights, and cardio equipment to support a real exercise routine. A noticeable improvement the second go-around was the service. Door staff were in abundance but minus the attitude and more forth coming with service. Front desk check-in and out was considerably warmer and more efficient. A couple of minor glitches (phone not working, bottle opener missing) were expeditiously addressed and all the while, a Whatever/Whenever agent kept track of the fixes until issues were resolved.

All hotel employees were very friendly and helpful and seemed genuinely interested in making sure you had a fine experience - from the valet at the door to check-in and the concierge. The lobby, while small, is very chic and comfortable and the Living Room bar/lounge is a great place to just relax - have a drink, read the newspaper, get some work done.... I did not eat at the restaurant, Craft, but did receive some helpful advice from the concierge on local hot spots. While some have criticized the location in the new Victory Park neighborhood I thought it was great - even if a little early on in the development of this area. Yes there is a lot of construction going on but it was not obtrusive in any way to me. And you can easily see the potential that will eventually exist here. It was also very convenient to just about every other neighborhood in Dallas I thought. AA arena is literally right across the street. Room was spotless and very comfortable - if you are enjoy a more traditional vibe or decor this is probably not the hotel for you. But I really liked the contemporary yet well thought out design of the room. They are not like some trendy hotel rooms that are designed to be cool looking but are ridiculously impractical. The rain shower head was fantastic! Didn't use pool but the pool deck looks great on the 16th floor. Ghostbar was packed following a Stars hockey game - the balcony is a great place to have a drink and enjoy the view of the Dallas skyline. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend the hotel to friends I know would appreciate the vibe. Once again if you are into a more traditonal luxury hotel the W is probably not for you.

All staff repeated they did not have a contact name to call except for fire. They even said the problem happens all the time so the bar doesn't even try to help their guests.

Fitness Center. One of the better hotel gyms I have used. They have a full compliment of weight machines, dumbells/benches, and cardio equipment. All of the equipment is very new (along with the hotel itself) and is in good working condition. If you like to work out, you won't be disappointed. 3. Service. Both times I checked in, it was very quick and painless. One touch that I won't soon forget was that they provide you with a card to write down your last name and flight record locater. They will then check you in for your flight and deliver a printed boarding pass to your room. So simple, yet very helpful. A nice little touch that went a long way. Maybe other hotels are doing this, but this was the first time I have come across it. The Negatives: 1. Price. As other reviewers have noted, the prices are a little steep. Even though I was pleased with both of my stays, I would probably not stay here if i was paying out of my own pocket. I believe you can find better values in the Dallas area. 2. Location. This depends on a few things. If you are going to an event at the AA center, it could not be any more convenient. It's directly across the street. If you're not attending an event at the AA center, but there is one going on, traffic can get a little hectic in the area. Also, the first time I stayed there, i arrived at 8:45 PM. By the time I was ready to have dinner (just after 9:00), my options were very limited as many places had already closed (this was a Thursday night). If it's not a game night at the AA center, it is a little lonely in the area after 9:00 PM. 3. Showers. Two things I don't like about the showers. One, there's no door or curtain on them, so if you have the air conditioning on in the room, the opening lets that cool air into the shower. Two, the shower heads are the rain heads that provide a lot of water, but no concentrated stream. I might be in the minority, but I'm not a fan of this style. 4. A little too cool. This one depends on who you ask. It is a W and I guess this is how it's supposed to be. I'm a relatively young guy (33), but to me, this place comes across as trying too hard to be cool. Things such as putting you on the guest list to get into the Ghost Bar and making it seem like it's a huge deal, very mirrored and dark hallways and elevator banks that can be a little disorienting, showers without a door (see above) are all touches that some people might appreciate and others just be annoyed by. I'm somewhere in the middle. In summary, my two stays have been very enjoyable and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hotel. Just know, this is a W and you get all that goes along with that.", "Date": "November 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Personal Service\u201d", "Author": "travelbugChicago", "ReviewID": "UR10127731", "Content": "I can not tell you how impressed I was with the level of service this hotel and its staff exhibited during my unexpected one night stay.

Located just on the edge of downtown (at Victory), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s walking distance to the American Airlines arena and in the middle of tons of new development. The property oozes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cool\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with its smartly dressed staff, good-looking guests, swanky downstairs lounge, Bliss spa (with an incredible indoor/outdoor pool somewhere around the 15th floor), and W-themed rooms. Still, most of these cool features are to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s detriment. So many of the pretty guests were awful to be around. The lounge is a pulsating den of drunk people screaming over the tunes that the DJ spins, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see that many of these people are locals, not guests, who come to hang out. At the top of the hotel is Ghost bar, which is a study in design gone wrong and people gone \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wronger.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The staff (not the W\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own) are rude, the guests are obnoxious, and the service is slow.

She said that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been battling noise problems since the hotel opened, but clearly they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not doing anything to stem late-night disturbances.

The view was the best part. The 158 sq. foot baclony overlooks the American Airlines Center. The rooms are nice, but definitely could be nicer given the price. The Good: The Hotel is very hip and trendy. Friendly staff. I was escorted to my room. Great pool even though it should face the opposite direction towards Dallas. The bed was very comfortable and the showers were nice. The Bad: The price...WAY TOO EXPENSIVE. It's not worth it. I'd pay $400 maybe for what I had. You have to be very very careful about what your final charge will be. They nickle and dime you to no end! Everything is overpriced. My room was $599 and my final bill was over $800!!!! I got a room, a beer, and some jelly beans and next thing I know I get an $800 charge. Absolutely insane. I will not stay there again to be honest. Helpful tips: Don't tip the valet until after you check out ($24 overnight). Bring your own alcohol. Hide it in your luggage. Don't eat anything at the hotel or in the room!!! Don't touch anything that has a seal on it or you'll get charged. Be prepaired to pay much much more in taxes for the room. There's a list a mile long of different taxes. USE A CREDIT CARD! NOT A DEBIT CARD! If you use a debit card to pay, they will pre-authorize your account with a very very large amount of money (my room $599, they authorized $840). They say it's to cover any incidental damage if needed. They won't tell you any of this when you check in. Overall, the hotel was very nice and my guests has a great time. I won't be going back there until I'm a multi-millionaire without a care in the world about what I'm charged. If you don't know to ask something, they won't tell you so keep reading these reviews.

The balcony furniture is made of wicker or something and none of it offers you any shade, but i guess it would be great for sunning yourself. The bed is awesome, there is a big flat screen, DVD player, small fridge, comfortable furniture and internet (10 bucks a day). I stayed very comfortable in my room. The location was great! I had Mavs tickets and its literally right across the street.

I was also hesitant given the fact that the prices I'd seen listed for the property were considerably higher than any I'd seen at other W hotels. However, when I saw that I could get a decent room for under $300 per night, I figured it was worth checking it out for a couple nights anyway. I guess that hotel has taken quite seriously the complaints they've received, because with only one exception, we found the service and the staff to be exceptional at the W Victory. They are now on a par with other W hotels at which I've stayed, which means their service is much better than your average hotel. We had no problems with air conditioning, staff attitude, nor cover charges for Ghostbar. (As hotel guests, we were allowed to enter Ghostbar without paying any cover. This was on a Tuesday night; perhaps it's a different situation on Friday or Saturday.) The food at Craft is better than your average restaurant, and the service is even better. However, I'm not entirely convinced that the food is worth what they charge for it. I have to say that I am particularly disappointed in their coffee, but obviously, that's not the reason people go there. I'm also a vegetarian, so perhaps those that eat meat would enjoy their dishes more. Worthy of a special mentions are Susan and Sidney (Sydney?), who work at the Whatever/Whenever desk. We didn't have any particularly unusual requests, but they handled those we gave them swiftly and without any problems. Also worth mentioning is the fact that a special request submitted a few days before my arrival was fulfilled. I requested a larger bathrobe because the standard size is way too small for me. A 2X sized one was hanging on a hook in my room when I arrived. The only criticism I'd have is of the \"welcome ambassadors,\" who were the worst I've experienced at W hotels. It wasn't just the first one that failed upon our arrival; they were repeatedly disappointing. They tended to not open doors for us, didn't welcome us back to the hotel on our return and (with one exception) were never there to help us get a cab as we were told they would at the W/W and front desks. In contrast to the rest of the staff, which seemed to go out of its way to be friendly and polite, these guys seemed completely disinterested. There were a couple of times where I felt like some of them did just what they're supposed to, but I'd say that happened perhaps 5% of the time we came and went.

When we arrived at the front desk they were very friendly and professional. They handed me a card welcoming us to the hotel and offering complimentary valet parking. I had reserved a standard room. The Lobby is hip and very upscale, the general colors are soothing and chic. All the staff were always pleasant and polite. We went up to our room and were surprised that we had been upgraded to a suite, room 1401, stunning views of Dallas modern skyline on one side, and on the other side of the ultra large balconey the American Airline Arena. The room was ultra modern, luxurious and just beautiful. It was large, the size of a loft or an apartment and furnished with top of the line flat screens, two, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. The room had beer, champagne, salsa, and chips to help us celebrate our anniversary with our friends. It had two bathrooms stocked with Bliss spa products.and 4 robes. The living room had an extra large modular grey L shaped suede couch. The dinner area had a large table with 6 white leather chairs. The bedroom had a chaise with magazines and books for a soothing reading spot overlooking the downtown skyline. The bed was wonderful! We went to dinner and returned with around 15 friends and relatives and had room to spare, they are all from Dallas and were impressed with the cool and hip suite. We also found more goodies and chocolates had been sent to our suite. I have traveled the world and stayed in many hotels. But I will tell you this by far was the best stay we have ever had.

I had read some negative reviews earlier so I contacted the hotel directly and they assured me with 2 phone conversations that they opened last summer and have now worked out the original issues. We checked in about 3:30 pm and were given the suite I had booked 3 months earlier. We had a WOW suite (#1401) which in on the north end of the hotel so it has a fabulous view of American Airlines Center and all the large electronic boards in Victory Park. (If fact on Sunday, American Airlines Center aired the entire Stars game on the large monitor so we sat in our room eating yummy takeout from nearby Luna de Noche for brunch at the suite's dining room table and watched the game.) The suite is over 1000 square feet and has 2 complete baths, a large room with a sectional couch that seats 6-7, a chair, a dining room table with 6 chairs and a desk with a chair. There is a very large Flat Screen TV mounted over the desk that was great for watching DVDs (bring your own) or regular TV. Two sides of this large room are floor-to-ceiling windows so the view is great. (Drapes close to make the room dark enough to feel like a movie theater.) There is a 150 square foot adjoining terrace with a couch out there. It was fun to stand on the terrace and look directly down on Victory Park and watch the people come and go from the games at American Airlines Center. The separate bedroom is nice size with more windows (but you hear no traffic because you are so high up), a chaise lounge and another wall-mounted TV with DVD. The bed is like a Westin heavenly bed so it was very comfy. The bathtub is nothing special but was good enough. The room had the Bliss sinkside 6 which is 6 of Bliss' most famous products so that was extra nice. (In fact the suite had 1 set of 6 in each bath so I had plenty to take home for future trips.) (If you are staying at the W you are entitled to 20% off all Bliss products in the Bliss spa on the 16th floor.) The room did have gray-blue paint on some walls and I can see how some people would find that bit dark and dull but we didn't have a problem with that due to all the great windows. The furniture is modern but still comfortable. There is a mini-refrig, a safe and 2 closets in the room too. The only issue we had was that we had to call a couple times for the staff to pick up some trash bags that we had left outside our door after we cleaned up after a small party. Perhaps no one does that from 2 am to 8 am? We called again and they came pretty quickly. We just didn't want our neighbors complaining about trash in the hall. Overnight Valet is $24 and it did take a bit of time to get our car out but it was Saturday night about 11:30 pm and lots of people were coming to Ghostbar (their trendy club on the 33rd floor). I mentioned that at checkout and they took it off my bill so that made the 30-35 minute wait acceptable. Be sure to walk around the hotel and see the BLISS spa on the 16th floor (I had a wonderful manicure there and they have a steam room, shower and quiet room), the Larry North workout room SWEAT (where we saw Dallas Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman working out) and Ghostbar on the 33rd floor (cover is free for women and $20 for men). You really should go walk on the glass terrace that sticks out over the sidewalk where you can look straight down 33 floors. It is very cool. You can go from 8 pm to 10 pm before the crowd or later when it is busy and people-watch. There is also a very nice lounge/bar on the ground floor by the checkin desk with comfy couches and the 5 star CRAFT restaurant (from NYC) is on the lobby floor too. We didn't try room service so we can't comment on that. (The chocolate cake sent up by the general manager for my birthday was very good so we can recommend that.) The pool was closed for temporary repairs on our visit but usually it is open and it is very unique and cool for it is on the 16th floor which is in the middle with the W building: the bottom 1/2 of the building (floors 1 to 15) is the hotel and the top 1/2 of the building is the condos (floors 17-32). Overall, the W Dallas is a very nice place. The staff is young like the other reviewers mentioned but we found them to be very friendly and helpful. FYI: We brought our 2 small children and no one ever stared at us or acted unfriendly. Granted most guests are under 30 with no kids but you could bring your kids here is you wanted to. More and more restaurants are opening in the area so it will just be easier and easier to stay down there and walk around and not need a car. House of Blues is coming soon and Dick's Last Resort, Luna de Noche and Hooters are open now. We recommend this hotel for a special Dallas weekend with modern accents.

I'm really convinced it's the attitude and mindset of a lot the reviewers thinking this is just another hotel. It's not. This is one of the biggest, hippest things that's ever happened to the City of Dallas and as a result, there's a lot more to deal with among \"guests\" and staff. To me, you have to go in with a certain mentally if you are to stay here. Dallas happens to be the \"LA of the South\" and this new W is one of the best \"see and be scene places\" in DFW, and I've lived here for the past 20 years and there aren't many. So you have to come in here with certain expectations. Attitude may be present among certain staffers but it's only because their guard is up. They have to deal with a line that snakes out the front door past the front desk and reception in the lobby every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights with people trying desperately to get in to Ghostbar. So they've seen and heard it all. If you go in wearing anything other than khakis or sweatpants you should be fine. But if you aren't dressed for \"the scene\" on Saturday night, you might feel out of place. Yes, the rooms are some of the most expensive in W's portfolio nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but that might be because it's months old and other than Hotel ZaZa, no other hotel fits it's theme in DFW. Half the building is hotel (up to floor 16, which features the only infinity edge pool at any Dallas hotel to my knowledge), while the other half are residences. The views are either of downtown or along I-35 with pretty much just a power grid to look at. A lot of clubbers come here on the weekends to go to Ghostbar, so you probably will have better service outside of \"clubbing\" times. My July experience went flawlessly, check-in did take quite a while, requiring an inexperienced staffer making several trips to the back (off to see the \"wizard\") checking with her manager to ensure I received my SPG Gold upgrade to the next available class of room (which was a terrace, worth the wait\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6more on that later). After about 20 minutes had passed and attempting several \"over rides\" I got my room. Keep in mind this was over July 4 th weekend and it was 2:00 PM in the afternoon, so they cut me a lot of slack. I also booked this room with the expectation that they would provide me with all my \"Bliss Spa\" goodies in room that was part of a packaged deal. Since nothing was mentioned of this upon check in, I figured they wouldn't be waiting for me in my room like I wanted. As this room was a surprise for my girlfriend's birthday, I had to go get her and called letting them know I booked a package and they were unfamiliar with what was on offer. I had to go down the list of what I was promised (I probably should have requested the kitchen sink, they would've thrown that in too they were so clueless). But\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6upon arrival hours later, everything was in room as promised and they even list candles, turned down the room, and had their signature CD playing. Pool scene was great during the day. Yes it is not really in the sun, but you can pull loungers out into the water covered sun areas. And yes, there aren't many places to lounge around but there again there aren't many rooms here so I never saw it packed. Service from the pool bar was great, offering several good menu items and drinks, if a little pricey. Also there is a walk-up bar in case you need something NOW and don't wanna wait for a server to approach you. Only downer was a freak thunderstorm blew threw and shut down the whole pool area, with staffers coming to secure all furniture and run people off (for their \"safety\"). That's Texas though, storms here are fierce. On my most recent October visit, I again used my SPG Gold status and wanted a skyline view room as all I booked was bargain basement. First room was so smoke ridden all it took was opening it 6 inches and then I slammed it shut. Looks like a trip down to the front desk is in order! Immediately upon approach, several staffers said \"what's wrong?\" very concerned I came back so quickly. I replied \"it's a little smokey\" then one of the bell hops overheard and said \"he's just being nice, he could really let you have but won't\". In amazing \"guest service recovery,\" fashion the attendant was very sympathetic wanting to know the room number again, the floor, and then offered us a complimentary upgrade to a $700 a night suite! He personally walked us up, made sure the room was alright this time, and that was that! I ended up taking several pics which you'll see attached to my review. The concept suite was amazing. This could easily sleep 6. Living room had tiled entry, half bath, living room with sectional sofa, dining room seating 6, plasma TV, Bang and Olufsen stereo, separate HVAC.

Females are in free no matter the day or time. 3) Pay at least $5 for valet if you're just going for the Ghostbar or anything else besides an overnight stay. $22 for daily valet parking. 4) Expect South snobbish, trendy attitude. But don't give it back and most of it will all melt away. Walk in with confidence. 5) If it's Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night dress accordingly. Like you're going \"out\" for an evening. Upon entering you'll be flashed with blue and red \"tunnel\" type walls. Think Space Mountain entry. Dallas is really a \"developing nation\" when it comes to 4 and 5 star chic, luxury hotels. Next year we finally get a long-anticipated Ritz Carlton, then in 2009 a Mandarin Oriental. But in the mean time your only options are the W and ZaZa.

However, after reading these reviews, my expectations were pretty low. The GOOD - this is one of the better looking Ws I've stayed in. A lot seem to be dark and small, but this one was very spacious and had great light and colors. The Bliss spa was also nice, but a little overpriced for Dallas spas. The Sweat gym by Larry North was fantastic - great machines and variety, even though no one was in there. The valet and staff members were helpful and pleasant. The BAD - I really think this hotel is overpriced for what you get. We booked a package deal that included about 5 \"do this and get this for free\" items, but I only took advantage of 2. The pool is pretty to look at, but you can't find a seat and it's in total shade. The water was freezing and no one could bare to step in. Probably the biggest draw for this place is the ghostbar. We were told to line up in the Hotel \"VIP\" line by at 11:30 to get in, but don't believe that. We got down on a Sat. night around 9:30 and still had to wait about 30 min. to go up. Granted, the views are pretty awesome when you get there, but it's not as great as the line would lead you to believe.

There were going to be 4 of us staying, and it was for a bachelorette party, so we definitely wanted a balcony/patio to make things special. Well, when we arrived, they told us that our \"Wonderful Room with a Deck\" (yes, that's actually how they describe it to you) was not available. They offered us another room w/ 2 Queens but it didn't have a deck, and, of course, that was one of our musts. So then they offered us a corner suite w/ 1 King bed, which was much bigger than the original room we booked, plus it had a huge terrace. We were told we could get a roll-away bed brought up to solve the issue of too many girls and not enough beds. When we got to our room, it literally smelled like a fresh pile of dog crap, and I noticed a wet spot on the floor. They do allow pets in this hotel, so it's not at all unlikely that they had just cleaned up a dog mess prior to our arrival. Luckily, our bellman noticed this as well, and called for house keeping to take care of the problem. Overall, the room was pretty amazing, and it was a definite upgrade from the original room we would have stayed in, and the best part was that we didn't have to pay any extra for it. The terrace was absolutely gigantic, and had a huge piece of furniture for lounging on. The room was huge and had two chaise lounges. The bathroom had a wonderful sunken tub, and there was a window that looked out onto the terrace. And the bed was by far one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Cons: For only being open a few months, the room was already showing signs of wear. The bedspread was snagged in many places, the metal accent tables were all scratched up on the top, and there were some scuffs on the wall. There were also some dirty spots on the cushions on the furniture on the terrace. The area w/ the toilet had a sliding door which kept getting stuck. One girl actually got stuck in the bathroom and we had to call maintenance to get her out. Now, back to the service. If I were to make a generalization, I'd say the service is better during the day/early evening then it is at night/ in the wee hours of the morning. We requested an iPod dock (they have them available for check-out), which they located and brought to us. House keeping did arrive promptly to take care of the odor issue (although they were more than a little over-zealous with the air-freshener). Someone called us from the front desk to ask me what time I wanted the roll-away bed brought up (I said 11 pm). And here's the bad. Someone in our group brought a bottle of champagne to the front desk to be delivered to up to the room for our guest of honor at a later time. We went out for a little bit that evening, came back to the room, and instead of the correct bottle of champagne, we had a different bottle, along with a card that said \"To Mr. & Mrs. Chambers on your wedding night.\" Well, I feel sorry for Mr. & Mrs. Chambers, because they never got their champagne. We called the front desk and explained the issue to them, and they said they would have someone right up to make the switch. 45 minutes later, we still didn't have the right bottle. We didn't get it until someone from our group noticed our bottle sitting on the front desk and took it up to the room herself. And no one bothered to come up to the room to collect Mr. & Mrs. Chamber's bottle. Fast-forward. We were still getting ready in the room at 11 pm, and the roll-away bed hadn't arrived. That was fine, since we weren't ready for it yet, and I figured we'd have it by the time we were done partying at Ghostbar. Well, at 2:00 am the bed wasn't still there, so I called Whatever/Whenever and asked for the bed and some extra blankets and pillows. 20 minutes went by, and nothing, so I made another call. To make a long story short, it took 4 more phone calls, and finally, a trip down to the front desk just to get some extra pillows and blankets to appear, and by this time, it had been an hour since the first phone call. We were told that it was taking so long to get the pillows because they had to go to the 17th floor to get them. What, are they WALKING up 17 floors? Lask I checked, they had an elevator. And we still didn't have a roll-away bed. The people who brought the pillows and blankets told us that they didn't have any roll-away beds left. Another trip downstairs to the \"night manager\" accomplished nothing. This manager told us that he would have to verify that these people told us there were no more beds available. Well, if these people were lying about them not having any beds, then why didn't we ever get one?? The guy was completely clueless and wasn't able to help us in any way. And we never got the roll-away bed. A visit to the front desk in the morning found a much nicer, and much more capable manager. She seemed apalled at the way things had been handled, and reduced our room rate for us. This made things much better, but didn't change what had happened the night before. I think part of the issue with this hotel, is that the majority of the staff is inexperienced and young. And when I say young, I mean 18 to early twenties. It just felt like no one was really in charge, and no one knew what to do. I'm very torn as to whether I'd stay here again...The hotel is worth checking out if you can deal with the unreliable service.", "Date": "August 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cWorst Hotel ever!\u201d", "Author": "Mistipk", "ReviewID": "UR5614026", "Content": "I have stayed at W's through out the states.
