We were treated in a first class manner throughout our five day stay as if we booked directly with Trump. The staff is young, competent, cordial and professional. We were visiting family on the island and had a car for our visit. The valet parking experience was great. Car was always ready at set time with only a quick phone call, and the valet service friendly and getting and in on Saratoga Street as easy as could be. One of our rooms had had a huge bathroom but very limited space around sink to put more a toothbrush and a bottle of mouthwash. Not the best design I have seen. I would also suggest that some effort be made to put the the electronic safes at eye or shoulder level rather than making guests get down on hand and knees to put in and take items out of safe.

Staying at the Trump was truly a wonderful experience. Upon arriving, my wife and I were assisted immediately with our car and luggage. Krystal welcomed us with leis and whisked us up to check-in. We were provided with a cold glass of flavor water and a cool towel to wiped our hand and face after our 8hr flight. When informed that we were celebrating our 10th anniversary, we were provided with a card, some chocolate and a bottle of champagne which I thought was outstanding. In our room we had a box complementary cookies and so much water throughout our stay, we could not even drink it all. Julia greeted us daily and provided us with helpful information about sights to see around the island. The only bad thing I can say is the garden tub (Is HUGH) and may be a little difficult getting in and out as well as water getting on the floor, the other is we had to leave. Mahalo to the entire staff who treated us like celebrities. Other notes: Hotel was very quite; elevators and valet service was very fast; room was clean twice daily and we did not know they were even there. A comfortable library with books and computers (and a printer) to book trips or check e-mails as well as a nice useful gym. Kitchen (stove & sink), microwave, refrigerator, plates, glasses, silverware, very well appointed, clean, and useful. I like the soap and shampoo so much that I packed what I brough back up. Bathrobes and slippers are a nice added touch and the closet, although useful, is very, very small. A/C worked great and quite, and the wife found the provided hair dryer and make-up mirror useful.", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFlawless\u201d", "Author": "Joel82", "ReviewID": "UR139527956", "Content": "We stayed at Trump Waikiki for 2 weeks during August.

Only a short walk across the road to the beach! actually alot nice down this end than the main beach area as its more private.

Great little breakfest area down the road called Eggs N Things! amazing huge breakfasts and quick service! went there like 5 times.

Perfect for kids <12 years old\u201d", "Author": "kat c", "ReviewID": "UR138903856", "Content": "I rarely write reviews online but I feel I have to for this hotel because it made our family vacation an unforgettable one! The attention to detail is absoultely amazing. After 12+ hours of travel to finally get to the hotel, at check-in, we were welcomed with Hawaiian lei's, watermelon infused ice water and face towels. The hotel room is clean, fully stocked, and the huge, double-sink marble bathroom with shower AND tub is just amazing. You may think this is not important but when you lug 2 kids to the beach and back, you WILL need the space to wash off the sand, the swimsuits, the snorkeling gear, etc., so trust me you will totally appreciate the extra space! The location is EXCELLENT! It's in the nicer part of Waikiki, a literal 1-minute walk to the beach, < 5 min walk to any restaurants. Oh and don't forget to ask for a beach bag from the Concierge--it's filled with beach towels, bottled water, sunscreen and even an apple and orange!! Yes, free bottle water during your entire stay!!! Service is absoultely impeccable at thsi hotel. You don't get the feeling that you're just a number. Everyone I dealt with (front desk, bell hop, concierge, housekeeping) was polite and warm. Some other extras: free wi-fi, free water bottle, high quality kids bath robes. You can stay at other 5-star hotels but just the free wi-fi and water alone will save you $100+, plus the personal service you won't get at other hotels. I have to comment on the swimming pool--lots of people complain that it's small. it's the perfect pool for kids younger than 12 who don't want a huge pool with deep ends. But if you are a good swimmer and want a diving platform or something, then this is not for you. Oh, and there is always a complimentary tub of fruit infused ice water by the pool! In summary: Pros: excellent location, excellent service. Free bottled water, free beach bag, free wi-fi, walking distance to coffee shops, beach and restaurants. Happy Hour menu at the restaurant in the lobby. Kids menus have resaonable prices. Luxury hotel without having giant tour buses parked in your lobby everyday!! The smaller pool is actually a pro for me because it's just the perfect size for my kids (7 and 9), and they got to practice snorkelling in the pool first before going to the ocean. They spent more time in the pool than on the beach!! Excellent pool-side service! Cons: Can't think of any really. It's all about your own expectation. If you like a huge hotel with the lobby the size of a school gym, then this isn't for you.

We loved having a refrigerator in the room but didn't really use the other kitchen items. What we like about the Trump is that it wasn't so crazy/busy like the other Waikiki resorts around. It was more serene and better suited for us. It was in a great location- close to all the shops and restaurants. The pool was definitely overrun at times by little kids splashing and jumping (we have 3 of our own kids but this is NOT a kid-friendly resort)- that was a bummer, but we still enjoyed lounging by the pool. As other reviewers have stated, the beach straight out from the hotel is not the greatest. It is very rocky. If you choose to stay on this section of the beach, buy water shoes. My husband cut his heel on some rocks. We ended up walking down further and spending our days at the soft sanded beach by the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. The only negative we could find was that the housekeepers came for turn down service so early two nights in a row- between 5:30 and 6 PM. I also expected something other than bottled water at turn down such as chocolates or something of that nature. It wasn't really a big deal, though.

Although we did not get the chance to use it, our room came with a fully equipt kitchen (plates, glasses, toaster, mixing bowls, utensils) which guests intending to buy local and make their own meals might appreciate. The bathroom quite possibly was my favourite part of our room with his and her sinks and a very sleek/modern look. The hotel is conveniently located close to a bus stop which is helpful for any planned excursions as well as the popular Eggs 'n Things. In fact, the location of the Trump is central to the beach, shopping and popular restaurants if you are willing to go for a nice stroll in the evenings (highly recommended) which is much more convenient than driving around ( finding parking can be difficult and traffic is irritating in the evening). We enjoyed using the pool and hot tub despite their smaller size and found the hotel facilities were always very well maintained and clean. Additionally, the staff was very welcoming and friendly and always willing to help you find a good place to eat. We felt it was a great place to begin our honeymoon adventure!

We were on the fourth-night-free promotion. The room retailed for $599/night. Our 11th floor view was very nice indeed. The location is quite good. My expectations were relatively high based TA reviews. We chose Trump out of curiosity and the nice kitchenette in the unit. The service ranged from very good to average; it seemed somewhat inconsistent to me. We had just come from a very nice stay at the Four Seasons Manele Bay on Lana\u2019i so the bar had been set. Check-in was fine. We were given an amenity for our anniversary, which was nice. There was also a welcome letter and a stuffed Trump seal for our son, which made him feel special. The room was clean and well-maintained. However, there was a single peg on the back of the door for hanging towels. We had plenty of good towels each day, just no place to hang them \u2013 strange in a beach environment. There was also a very large unused space behind the bathroom door where towel racks could have been installed or a clothes rack for drying, not unheard of in a beach environment. It was just an obvious blank area, as if the money had run out for any further enhancements. With three people in a room you need places to hang wet towels and swimsuits. At higher-end establishments the little details define distinction. The breakfast buffet and apparent food quality was a bit disappointing. It felt like they were cutting cost corners and that doesn\u2019t work when you\u2019re targeting (presumably) the top-end traveler. I\u2019m already paying for breakfast for two adults, I\u2019ll pay more, just make it a true high-end buffet like patrons expect. The buffet should be at least as good as the buffet you\u2019d find at a resort on little Lana\u2019i, but it wasn\u2019t. Our 4-year old son did eat free (as he did at the FS) which was appreciated. The staff was friendly but the attitude sometimes seemed contrived, perhaps it was just the Waikiki pace (compared to Lana\u2019i). The ladies at the concierge were always pleasant and the beach bags with towels and water were nice. I might send a couple of experienced employees from various departments \u2018undercover\u2019 to the Four Seasons on Lana\u2019i and Maui to take notes. That seems to be the standard they\u2019re striving for and they\u2019re definitely on their way. I took two postcards to the front desk and inquired how to most easily mail them. They did it for me \u2013 great. The $.90 could be billed to my room. Okay, convenient. Except at Four Seasons they have always mailed my postcards for free. No, I could not care less about $.90 when I\u2019m paying $600/night for a room plus another $75 for breakfast. At least the wi-fi is complimentary (unlike Four Seasons) so I won\u2019t complain. We laughed about it. As others have mentioned, the pool seems an afterthought. It is mostly patronized (and overrun) by young children although it was clearly designed for adults with aesthetics in mind. As a former lifeguard it seems like an accident waiting to happen as all the surfaces are very slippery when wet with plenty of abrupt pool edges. The readily visible pool across the street on the roof of the Embassy Suites looks more inviting (and much larger). The fitness room is sub-par for a property of this caliber \u2013 I am biased as I use such facilities frequently. Most guests/residents probably don\u2019t care though. Considering the view and actual unit it was not out-of-line for Waikiki. The stay was satisfactory. We just were not \u2018wowed\u2019 as we hoped we would be \u2013 expectations too high perhaps? Not sure about next time; maybe the Royal Hawaiian or a top-end room at the Outrigger, or Trump again?

I'm not sure what I was expecting, well actually I kind of am. I expected this relatively new hotel to be top notch in all departments. It was a nice hotel, and if I was staying there in city like NY or Dallas, I wouldn't have too much to complain about. But... this is Hawaii I was turned off a bit by the city feel of a hotel that was blocks from a beautiful beach. The staff was mostly friendly, but lacked the ability to make you feel special, like most great and pricey hotels should. Anyways, here's the real breakdown of the good and bad: Pros: Location, concierge services (towel bags and overall friendly and helpful service), kitchens and laundry in most suites (very useful with 2 young'ns like we have.) Cons: Food. Very mediocre breakfast and even worse room service. The quality of the food here is well below any reasonable expectation for the rates paid. I had a crab benedict that tasted like it came from a cheap chinese buffet restaurant. Rooms. The suite was very nice to look at the bed in the bedroom was very comfortable...but, I have to sleep on the couch due to my snoring, and the couch bed was so uncomfortable (the couch itself was too small to lie on) that I ended up with a bad neck for 3 days after my stay. Also, if you have small kids and think a regular suite will suit you, think again. Then under 800 sq. ft. of space is so cramped with all the furniture they have in it that our two sons, ages 2 and 4, had no room anywhere to run. This was as much my faullt as theirs, but you should know as a parent that theses rooms are way too tight to relax in with a full family. That's it. I think it's probably a great place to stay if you are in town on business, or are without kids, so long as you can handle the food issue. My recommendation though would be to stay across the street at the Halekulani. It's a much hotel. And one last thing...the spa isn't a spa, it's a massage room.

We arrived after a 10 hour flight from Sydney for our two week stay, and were greeted with happy and willing staff who grabbed our heavy luggage from the taxi and took care of it from there. We were escorted up to the lobby and presented with watermelon flavoured iced water and hot towels, which were VERY welcome!! Our room wasn't quite ready, as we had arrived three hours before check-in time, but we were told to come back in an hour, and sure enough, our room was ready for us! And what a room it was!! We were on the 16th floor in a one bedroom plus den ocean view suite. This suite had it all - full kitchen with microwave, cooktop, dishwasher, large fridge/freezer, front load washing machine and dryer, walk-in robe, massive ensuite with large tub, shower and twin vanities, plus another bathroom with shower, toilet and vanity, magnificent king size bed in the large bedroom, plus pull-out double sofa bed in the den, 6 seat dining setting, lounge and flat screen tv's in the lounge, bedroom and den. Not to mention the stunning views!! Our lanais (yes, two of them!) were facing the Hilton Hawaiian Village, so we had front row seats to the Friday night fireworks from the supreme comfort of our room. As far as the other facilities in the hotel go, the business centre came in VERY handy, and even though there are only two computers in there, we very rarely had any trouble getting on one. If you have your own laptop or tablet, there is free wi-fi throughout the hotel, so you may not even need to use the business centre. Another bonus - there is a printer which was always stocked with paper, so if you need to print your boarding passes you could. The gym was great - bikes, eliptical and treadmills, plus three different types of complimentary flavoured water. We didn't use the pool, but even though it is small, it looked good to us! We had one breakfast buffet at In-Yo, which was excellent, and in a great spot right near the pool with views. If you are staying for more than a couple of days, here are a couple of tips:- take advantage of the complimentary pillow menu (yes, seriously!). Well worth it. As there were three of us (women), I was worried about having enough clothes hangers, but we were pleasantly surprised that we could order more from the Trump Attache at no extra charge. One thing I didn't like - there was nowhere to hang your used towels in the bathrooms. They are taken away morning and evening, but sometimes you would be happy to use them more than once and there was just no option for this unfortunately. Also, if you are staying in a room like ours, I was in the Den and there was absolutely nowhere for me to unpack anything without encroaching on the main bedroom, which got pretty annoying for a two week stay. A chest of drawers would have been very much appreciated.The sofa-bed in the den was reasonably comfortable, but I wouldn't recommend it for any more than maybe three nights. My co-travellers said the king sized bed was the best they had ever slept in. To summarise: - this hotel is in an excellent position, with two bus stops less than 100 metres away, and taxis right downstairs. Eggs n Things is a five minute walk up the road, and the main street, Kalakaua Avenue a further minute away. The staff are absolutely brilliant in every way. The ladies I travelled with weren't used to using a coffee machine (we're Aussies!) and requested an electric jug instead, and one was brought up within ten minutes - excellent!! The nightly turn down service is a treat! They turn down the bed, leave you with Mr Trump's own bottled water, replace towels and tidy the kitchen, replacing tea, coffee, sugar etc. If you are heading to the beach, the complimentary beach bags with fruit, towels, water and suncreen were a nice bonus. This hotel is not beachfront, but given the right room, I'm sure anyone would be thrilled with the ocean views. Yes, it is a bit expensive, but it is well worth spending the extra money to stay in Honolulu's Number 1 rated - and newest - hotel, and not hard to see why it is Number 1. I can't wait to get back there, and will definitely be staying back at the Trump!!", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cVery pleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "PhoenixFun", "ReviewID": "UR133045305", "Content": "Hotel is very short walking distance to beach and service staff is excellent.

I never heard anyone explaining what they cannot do . I felt the staff was trying everything they can, to make my stay comfortable. YES was the answer to every need . Living in Hawaii for 23 years, this is a true and positive example on what a guest should expect from the \"Aloha Spirit\". The hotel is across from the Halekulani, Waikiki Shore and Outrigger Reef hotels. You look straight into these neighbor oceanfront hotels from most rooms, or from the pool deck. You get a nice view from this 36 story building - it's just not oceanfront. You're in walking distance to anywhere in Waikiki - excellent location. The rooms are fully equipped apartments. I stayed at a studio with a full kitchen. I did not use the kitchen amenities, but would have loved to have a mini bar. The refrigerator was empty, but two bottle of water were standard and given during their turn down service. The beds were super comfortable, and I had an excellent night sleep. My room had a real desk and work chair, a sofa, and a coffee table. The only phone was on the desk. I did not see a phone by the bed. Bathroom: The marble floor was nice, very clean and towels were white, soft and I found more than plenty. I forgot my tooth brush and was pleased to see amenities were readily available. The lightning was bright. I was kind of hoping for a jacuzzi bathtub with a TV and a raindrop shower- but I guess there's room for improvement even in the nicest property. The hotel is expensive compared to other Waikiki hotels, but you pay for the excellent service and super clean facilities. The pool on the 5th floor facing a busy street was a bit noisy. The lounge chairs were plenty, but a soft mattress would have been an improvement. The pool area included a small jacuzzi. I was hoping a five star properties with the rates you pay at the Trump may include sauna, jacuzzi, steam rooms and a computerized gym, but I did not find this here. The gym was rather average and relatively small. The gym was very clean and working out was pleasant - and I welcomed ice water and headsets that were readily available. Free wireless internet was available anywhere in the hotel. I was trying to make a dinner reservation t at the Steak house, but wasn't able to get a table n until 9.15 pm. I went to a near by restaurant instead. I had a double expresso at the pool bar. The expresso was excellent, but a base price of $10.00 was over the top. Where was the cookie? In addition the hotel added a mandatory tip (18%) and charged Hawaii State Taxes also on the tip. I found this rather unusual. I asked the beverage manager, and he was thankful for my comments and took the $12.58 expresso charge off my bill. The hotel had a library and a very nice conference room - but I did not see an executive lounge. Breakfast was not included, so I went to Starbucks across the street for a pastry and a $2 expresso. If this hotel was in Asia, I would have given it 4 stars.

Our room was two bedroom plus den. The bed in the master bedroom was so comfortable I want to get one. Seriously comfortable. This room was huge! Much bigger than expected. The master bedroom itself was enormous, and so was the en suite. Of the three bathrooms, two had bath tubs. The master bedroom's tub was absolutely massive. The shower wasn't great though and we used the other two bathrooms to shower in. The second bedroom was also very spacious with a large en suite. The hotel provided two baby cots for our youngest two children - a smaller cot for our 6 month old, and a full sized cot for our 2 year old. These were both proper wooden cots with bumpers and thick mattresses (not the horrible portacots/pack-n-plays that hotels sometimes provide). The kitchen was spacious and well equipped. Quite honestly, I didn't see the point of the den before we arrived, but I was so wrong - it is such a great area for the kids to use. There were two balconies both with beautiful ocean views each accessed via solid, heavy double glazed doors. I was concerned being so high up with such young children. But there was simply no way they could have opened them. It felt very secure. The twice-daily maid service was amazing, and was so discreet we dubbed them \"house elves\". They seem to have thought of just about everything to make your stay as comfortable and easy as possible. For example, they provide great beach bags (including fresh towels, sunscreen, water, fruit); and at the pool they provided disposable infant swim nappies (complimentary) another added bonus I have not encountered anywhere else we have stayed previously. The infinity pool was one area of the hotel that was disappointing. Especially when compared to the two hotels next door, both of which had large pools and sun decks which could be seen from our pool. Which was quite small, as well as shady and windy on several occasions. However, the location of the hotel (ignoring the fact it is not right on the beach) is excellent. There are so many good restaurants and shops in that part of Waikiki. We have always stayed down the other end of Waikiki previously, and I prefer the location of Trump. Even though the pool was disappointing, I cannot rate this hotel less than 5/5 because it is simply excellent... Managed incredibly well. Excellent staff. Gorgeous and comfortable room.

Gracious is what we continued to experience throughout our stay. I had booked the room with breakfast included, but had forgotten to indicate the correct # of guests when booking the room. So, we were short breakfast tickets on checkin. I asked about it and they explained my mistake and then proceeded to give us the rest of the tickets complimentary, anyway. This was totally my fault, but they righted the situation for free. As we were sorting through our stuff on the last day I also discovered a free massage coupon, which I could kick myself for not seeing earlier. We didnt get to take advantage of that or the free bottle of wine offered as another Anniversary gift. Again, on the gracious scale, the Trump scores high! We did take advantage of the breakfast buffet and the pool area. The staff were super accommodating at both. The buffet offered omelets to order and french toast in addition to the rest of the spread, which was nice. The selection was good (not great) and diverse to cover Asian and American pallets. Great papaya juice...the coffee was a letdown, though. In fact, the only somewhat disappointing thing about this place was the crummy coffee (stabux across the street, though). At the pool, the staff greeted us with towels, took our drink orders and were as chatty (or not) as you liked. I do warn you to get there before lunch if you want chairs in the sun. We got there around 1:30 and sat in the shade for an hour before being able to jockey for sun chairs. THe pool is also really just a single lane lap pool, which would have been great except for the 5 people that were splashing around...no laps for me:). The views from our room were great and the location is perfect. We walked all over Waikiki night and day, enjoying the beach, restaurants, shopping and sight seeing. Our room was nice, but starting to show signs of age. These are all owned residences that the Trump manages the rental stuff on. The carpet needed cleaning and there was some signs of wear in the bathroom that were not what you would expect if it were a Trump owned hotel room.

Spacious with well appointed kitchen and bathrooms - 2 baths with showers was really nice.

Our car was parked and we were immediately checked in to our room and escorted there. Our luggage arrived almost immediately. This arrival experience was just what we needed - we felt so pampered! The room was large and modern, with a full kitchen in the entry hall, including nice dishes and wine glasses, fully equipped. The bathroom was one large room with two sinks and an open shower. Toilet was not separate, which wasn't ideal but that was fine. Also, there was a high-accuracy scale in the bathroom. The bed was amazing - sort of like the Heavenly Beds that they have at the Westin Hotels. You can choose from several types of pillows when making the reservation, to customize the sleeping experience. Nice! The sitting area is between the bed and the balcony. It was very modern and comfortable with a flat screen TV. We spent most of our time sitting on the balcony, though, because the view was so beautiful. The balcony was completely private, unlike some places. The room was really quiet too. The pool is on the fourth floor, kind of like a Vegas hotel. It's made for dipping and sunbathing, not laps, as it is in an almost maze-like shape. That makes for a nice place to hang out and the service there was very complete including food and bar delivered to your chair. You can choose shaded areas or sunny places. The chairs were very nice with good covers and very comfortable too. I had a most excellent sashimi lunch that was very fresh. I wish I could have spent more time there! The hotel is on the main strip, and an easy walk/jog to Diamond Head for doing the loop in the morning. You can stop at Lulu's on the way back for a \"recovery beer\". ;-) It's behind a park, but the view was very nice and the location was convenient. I'm not big on sand/beach, so I didn't miss the beachfront. Pictures below.

Since we were staying a week, staff upgraded our superior studio room to a deluxe room no charge. We were given a room right over the pool. We could see the ocean from our deck. As in previous posts, staff came in twice a day to clean and turn down service the room. It's the little things that count with this hotel.

It was relaxing! There is an in-room safe which after we mistyped the code we had to call the front desk for it to be re-set. Staff was up within ten minutes to reset the safe. Later the front desk called to ensure the service was to our satisfaction. On the last day, the hotel offered us a hospitality room to stay in since our plane didn't leave until 11 pm. This gave us one more day to do things in Waikiki and then return to the room to shower and get ready to travel. All at no extra charge.

It was more like a one bedroom though - full marble kitchen with every imaginable appliance, huge bathroom with very deep marble bath and a sofa/sitting area as well as the kingsize bed (which is the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in) We were on floor 12 and had a view of the ocean from the balcony even though we didn't request this and had just booked a standard city view. Although we arrived early in the morning we still weren't able to get into the room until right on 3pm so we decided to have lunch at the \"In-Yo\" restaurant on the pool level. Don't both going there - over priced for average food. We should have guessed this beforehand as there was NO other people dining for lunch. A glass of juice will set you back $8.50. The girls behind the counter were a bit pre-occupied eating the cocktail garnishes behind the serving area to bother with good service. They seemed bored and unfriendly compared to the rest of the great staff around Trump. Save yourself the dollars and the boredom by going to eat down the street. Aside from that our stay was great. The room was serviced twice daily to a very high standard, considering the state we left it in after shopping, swimming etc. The room was very quiet and we did not hear a peep from the street, other rooms or the corridors. The location is great - close to the high end side of town with heaps of great restaurants to choose from and close enough to walk to Ala Moana shopping centre. The beach is a minutes walk away. The pool is great - cool drinks, Ipads and Kindles are all on offer for use. There are fresh beach towels and great changing/toilet facilities also. I have read people whinging about the pool being small. It is not that small and seriously if you are going to Hawaii to hang around a hotel pool then there is something wrong. The bigger the pool the more kids and bogans I say! Trump is totally different from the other resort style hotels offered in Waikiki. It doesn't have the tackiness, overcrowded pools, pigs at buffets or loud crass footy groups that you see at other hotels. It is quiet, classy, low key and quality.

The hotel is located within a very short walking distance to a beautiful outdoor shopping area with many luxury shopping stores and restaurants and across the street from Waikiki Beach. Upon arrival, the staff greeted us warmly with a lei and check in was easy and problem free. The room was very clean and nicely designed. The alarm clock sounded amazing (ihome ipod alarm clock). They had some relaxing music playing when we walked in to our room. The kitchenette was a big plus to the room! This allowed us to save some money on vacation by being able to eat left overs and make snacks in the room. The shower was a huge open shower. Beautiful in grey and white marble! The spa and workout room were beautiful and very clean. I only wish that the pool was bigger (or that they had a second pool) and that the glass wall around the pool (the pool is on the 6th floor of the hotel) was taller to block more of the breeze. It gets very windy on the 6th floor! The hotel staff was very polite and if the elevator showed up on their floor for them to get in, they would greet you with \"Aloha\" and would not get on the elevator with you. They would wait for the next one. I thought this was very polite. The staff helped us setup a tour to the Cultural Center and everything was perfect. We are very picky about hotels and find that this one was very clean, beautifully designed, and in a great location. Every morning upon walking out of the hotel, the staff would greet us warmly and were more than happy to help with directions or anything we needed. The elevators were fast, yet not jolting.

Our room had a full stove, microwave, fridge, pots, pans, utensils, plates, the works. Great for warming up leftovers or cooking a light meal. Later on the first day, we were given some chocolates and a postcard saying Happy Anniversary and letting us know that a complementary bottle of champagne was waiting for us in the downstairs lounge. We thought that was a great touch. You can walk right to the main shopping area in Waikiki from the hotel. No need to drive. You can also walk right onto the beach. I don't think I would recommend this hotel for families with children since the pool was small and clearly just for adults to wade and sun themselves. No playing really possible in that size pool.

There were two couples traveling and we each had deluxe partial ocean view rooms on the 20th floor. None of us have a bad thing to say about this hotel. The room is spacious with a very comfortable king bed, sitting area, desk and flat-screen TV. The bathroom is large with a very nice open shower (with very good pressure), nice soaker bath tub and double sinks. The kitchen has a toaster, microwave, stove top, coffee maker and refrigerator. We found this to be particularly useful on mornings we wanted to stay in and enjoy breakfast on our lanai. I was skeptical about \"partial ocean view\" but was blown away when we opened the curtains and lanai doors and saw the stunning view of the ocean. We could lie in bed and stare outside and see the waves rippling in the ocean. Absolutely beautiful. The lanai was also very nice and provided complete privacy. Service was impeccable. Everyone we dealt with at the hotel always greeted us with a smile on their face and was extremely helpful. We ate breakfast at the in-hotel In Yo Cafe twice and had drinks at Wai-Olu Lounge. Both were pricey but very nice. Everything about this hotel makes you feel like you are being pampered and living the life of luxury. We were greeted with beautiful shell lei, pineapple infused water, cold towels and cookies from the Honolulu Cookie Company in our room. I disagree with those who say this hotel lacks ambiance. The Trump feels Hawaiian without being dated. The hotel is beautiful and modern. We spent every morning by the pool and loved it! The view from the pool is beautiful (nice place to watch the fireworks on a Friday night). Yes it isn't huge but it was more than enough for us. We loved how quiet and relaxing the pool area was compared to other hotels. We didn't have to rush in the morning to find loungers and there is ample shaded and sunny area on the pool deck to satisfy everyone. I'm frustrated by those who complain about the hotel not being on the beach - if you do any amount of research at all before booking you would know this. The location was the best part. You are literally a crosswalk away from the beach (the Trump is right behind the Outrigger Reef) and on the other side, you are right by Lewers and Kalakaua for endless restaurant and shopping choices.

We had considered a few hotels in Honolulu and decided to stay at both the Surfrider and Trump (both for four nights). We also considered Halekulani (but this was still undergoing renovation so not an option for us) and the Pink Palace (but they only had smoking rooms left so again, not an option for us). I was really looking forward to my stay at Trump as I had read fabulous reviews and noted its position as the number one hotel in Waikiki. Initial impressions were good - we were greeted by lovely shell leis and escorted to the check in desk by a member of staff. Whilst we were checking in she brought us cool and refreshing towels and a cool drink. Check in was fast and efficient. We had booked a deluxe ocean view room with lanai. When I entered the room I was a bit disappointed with the size - compared to the Surfrider, it was smaller - not significantly smaller but the space felt tight. I was also a bit disappointed with the \"ocean view\" - yes we had a view of the ocean but really it was obscured by at least 50% by the hotels in front of us. We had booked a partial ocean view at Surfrider and that view was much better. I was pretty disappointed but moved on. The bed itself is comfortable and they had a pillow menu section which was nice. The bathroom was a really great size with a double sink. The shower was unusual in that it was open with no screen and next to the bath. I thought that water would splash everywhere in the bathroom but it didn't so obviously it was designed quite well despite the look. The kitchenette was very handy. Onto the housecleaning - we didn't think that the housecleaning was up to the level that others had written about. We felt that all the housekeepers did was make the bed up and refresh the towels. We had forgotten to leave a tip the first day so I thought it may have been that, but we left a tip every other day and the level of housekeeping did not change. Overall, housekeeping was just average and definitely not to the standard of what you would receive for example in a five store hotel in Asia. They even left a dirty dish and glass in the sink! I was a bit astounded at that. Another reason why I did not rate this as \"great\" is that this hotel really lacks any ambience. Some reviewers mentioned that it is just like a condo and not a resort - this hits the nail on the head. Maybe the Surfrider is older and sure the rooms aren't fantastic but boy does it have presence and a great ambience! Trump lacks all of this. Also although they provide beachside concierge services meaning you can reserve a chair and umbrella on the beach (we did this 2 of the 4 days) the service isn't as great as if you were staying at a beachfront hotel. For example, at the Surfrider you can book your chairs but then they have wait staff come around and take drink and food orders and that to me is what a beach holiday is about. Also, the part of the beach that the Trump beach concierge is located is not that great - the sand is quite rough with lots of little shells and particles and there is a reef almost straight away. Surfrider and Pink Palace have by far the best location in Waikiki (in my opinion). The beach concierge man was very nice and friendly and helpful and let us move chairs when a beachfront one became available. I actually really liked the pool area at Trump! Yes it is small but it's very relaxing as it's not too busy and the pool itself is lovely. Yes children play in the pool but you can easily swim around them. Also the pool area has a delightful balcony where you can lie on the beach chairs and watch the sun go down. Overall I would rate my experience at Trump as good (not really very good but I thought it was better than \"average\") but it is definitely not a \"great\" hotel. The main reason is that there is no hawaiian ambience - but for the leis that they give you, you could be staying at the city hotel. If I had to choose again, I would not stay here if I was on my honeymoon. I would definitely choose the Surfrider or the Pink Palace because you cannot beat that location (the Halekulani's beach area is far too small for my liking and you cannot set beach chairs on their beach). The only advantage that Trump has over other hotels is that if you have a family (I don't) it may be worthwhile as all the rooms have kitchens. That is the only advantage.

You could always find a patch of sun (particularly good in the afternoon so we always headed to the beach in the morning then the pool after lunch). The hotel is slightly set back from the beach behind a small park but you are talking a 1 minute stroll, and don't forget to pick up your daily beach bag from the concierge (who was also excellent, we spoke to him daily for advice, bookings, directions etc) which includes cool bag, towels, water, fruit and sun screen. We only ate in the hotel a couple of times as Waikiki has so much choice but the food we did eat was great and their 'World's best Mai Tai' is worth visiting for on it's own. Location is at one end of the beach just before the Hilton Hawaiian village, which is nice because it's slightly quieter but still right on the edge of all the shops and restaurants. I am glad we ended up here after many hours of internet research as I didn't see another hotel that topped it! Will definately return. If you visit there are a few things I would thoroughly recommend: 'House with out a key' at the Halekulani (2 hotels along) - Beach front cocktail bar / restaurant, plays live traditional Hawaiian music every night from 7 with accompanying Hula dancer. Great fun for a couple of hours although I would recommend arriving before 6 if you want a seat! Surfing Lesson - Loads along the beach, all excellent, and where better to learn. Aloha Stadium swap meet - about a 15min drive from central Waikiki, $1 to park, great market for all your Hawaain essentials (shirts, jewellrey, ukelele etc) and a lot cheaper and seemingly more authentic (I'm sure they are probably not but is a more enjoyable experience) than town. North Shore - You must take a drive around the island to the north shore to see alll the surf towns and fantastic beaches! The hotel have a suggested route to take that includes Pearl Harbour (free to enter and well worth a trip), Japanese Monestry, famous road side shrimp trucks and many other places. Hawaii also has one of the US's lowest purchase taxes at about 4.8% so also a great place to shop.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Big Island, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cOur new favorite Waikiki hotel\u201d", "Author": "SheaG", "ReviewID": "UR128727532", "Content": "We travel to Honolulu fairly frequently for various things and we've stayed at most of the better hotels on the island. We wanted to stay in Waikiki this trip to do some surfing and check out a couple of restaurants, so we decided to try Trump because we were traveling with our 10-year old and our 20-year old in school at Manoa was going to come over, so we wanted more space than a hotel room at the Halekulani, Surfrider, or Royal Hawaiian. The one bedroom suites at Trump were running quite a bit cheaper than our suite options at the other hotels, plus it came with a kitchen. I'm not a Donald fan, but I have to give him props for this hotel. It's awesome! The suite was very large, with two lanais and tons of windows and a great, completely stocked kichen with top of the line appliances and a mini wine cellar, flatscreen TVs, great bathroom, comfortable bed, and a pullout sofa bed in the living room. The restaurants and pool were very chic. Hawaii 5-0 was fillming while we were there and we saw camera crews and security and running actors, it felt like a little bit of LA in Hawaii. We did screw up by not requesting a higher floor as everyone says to do, we were on the tenth and the road noise in the morning was loud. We didn't mind the views of all the hotels and condos and pools, we like being in the city and enoying the \"scene\", but for the noise factor, elevation is key. It's a block to the beach, the concierge sets you up with towels and a beach bag and water. Service is impeccable but friendly. The lounge has great happy hour specials. The breakfast buffet was very good. This is definitely our new, cool spot to be in Waikiki and we will be back! It would be especially good for longer stays because of the size of the rooms and the awesome kitchen. It is not at all \"Hawaiian\", and that may turn some people off, but for locals like us who just want a great stay in the city, it was perfect.

We had originally planned to stay part of our trip at the Trump and part of our trip at the Moana Surfrider which is where we have stayed on previous trips but after spending our first 3 nights at the Trump we cancelled our Moana Surfrider reservation and booked extra time at the Trump. We were unable to fault it. We were welcomed to the Trump with shell lei's, refreshing fruit infused water and cool facewashers. All staff we encountered at the Trump were personable, polite and completely focussed on providing first rate customer service. In particular we had such fantastic help from Dashe at the front desk who assisted us in changing our reservations when we decided to stay. The Attache service is fabulous and willing to help with any request and the Concierge assisted us on several occasions to book tours and a rental car. The Trump is close to the shopping and restaurants on Kalakaua Avenue and we walked to Ala Moana shopping centre on several occasions. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and well appointed. Both of our rooms had lanai's (balcony's) and our first room had a small kitchen with a microwave and fridge and our second room had a full kitchen complete with a cooktop. Both rooms had a coffee maker with Honolulu Coffee Company coffee provided. Our second room also had a 'loungeroom' area. Housekeeping was faultless and we were given fresh towels several times a day and on one occasion when we requested extra towels we were given not just a set but a basket full of towels. We were given 'gifts' on arrival of coffee, a box of brownies and candies and some pineapple sugar and later in our stay we were given a tray of chocolates. The hotel is not beach front as reviews have previously stated but both of our rooms had beautiful ocean views and the beach is literally a 2 minute walk across the road. The Trump have considered all the things that make a customer feel important and valued and all things that make a stay comfortable for example the beach bags that are provided by the concierge desk containing water, towels, fruit and sunscreen and the ability to borrow Kindles and IPods from the pool deck. The pool is on the smaller side but it is impeccably kept and we never had trouble getting a lounge chair and we found if we went earlier in the day/lunchtime there were very few people there. We also loved the turndown service that included returning to the room with soft hawaiian music playing and bottled water provided. We had the opportunity to dine at BLT Steak and highly recommend it - delicious food (especially the popovers) and excellent service. Perhaps if there was one thing to fault it would be the buffet breakfast at In-Yo restaurant and by no means was it bad it just perhaps not worth the $32. We cannot recommend the Trump Waikiki highly enough and have already encouraged family and friends to stay there.

Loved the marble free-standing shower - bonus points. (a pet hate of mine is a bath and shower combo). Not that we used the kitchen only to get a drink but the fit-out was great. I thought the infinity pool was great, I know people complain but we didn't have a problem with it being crowded or finding a lounger. We spent most of the time at the beach anyway. If you want a big pool for families I suggest the Sheraton with it's adults only and kids pools if this is the type of vacation you are after. The staff were friendly and it deserves the 5 star rating.

So the area is not that busy, but of course you stay in a larger city and there is the usual city noise around like traffic or live music from surrounding hotels. Over all the Trump is awesome! The moment we arrived we were welcomed by very friendly staff members, which were always nice and helpful during our entire stay. We were upgraded to a 1bedroom suite that offered plenty of room for our family. What a nice surprise! We had a good room rate anyway since we had a 4th night free offer. I can also recommend signing up for the Trump card. I couldn't believe my eyes, when I saw that they really had taken care of all the things that I mentioned in my profile (e.g. I am a tea drinker, so an array of different teas was waiting and I like to sweeten my tea with honey so I also found a jar of that)...that was a very nice touch! The suite was excellent equipped, the kitchen is a dream top notch appliances, the bathroom spacious! Although we were on the lower floors (12) we enjoyed spectacular partial ocean view. The kids were thrilled by their welcome package (a tray of drinks - milk, different juices -, cookies and a personalized letter with recommendations like the Honolulu Zoo etc.). The other guests at the hotel were a mix of families with kids, mostly business travelers and couples. Although the pool is small, fancy (infinity) and a bit windy, it is good enough for a plunge after a day of sight seeing. The beach is really just a few steps away and you'll get nice beach bags from the concierge with water, towels and fruit. We also enjoyed watching the sun set during happy hour in the lounge! Spectacular! For us, the Trump Hotel was the perfect spot to stay during our Waikiki vacation. The accommodation, every single staff member and their service were outstanding. And most of all we felt very welcomed as a family! I also like that it is a smaller hotel without the usual shops and buzz in the lobby area. It has a SPA, a restaurant, breakfast cafe, too. We used to make breakfast ourselves in our room and had dinner once at the BLT steakhouse on site. The Trump hotel is very kid friendly, but it's not a family wonderland with pool lagoons, water slides and kids club entertainment what you might get at other properties. So if that's what you are looking for - go somewhere else. We, the parents and our three kids age 2,5,7 didn't miss a thing and we will definitely stay again at the Trump!

None of them are time-shares, so you'll be in a condo that's always rented as a hotel room. You will not see any difference in what you find at any top-end hotel. Everyone working at this hotel seems to have been infused with \"Aloha.\" Every employee we interacted with was quietly efficient, courteous and helpful, and made us feel welcome. As soon as you pull up to the door the valet has your door open and a bellman is standing by the trunk waiting to take your luggage. And, while $30 a day to park your car may seem like a lot, it isn't in Waikiki; the outdoor lot across the street is $36 a day. And it's great to pull up to the front and leave your car with the valet, and when I called down to have my car brought up it was usually there before we got down to the lobby. The room is immaculate, well-designed, and the furnishings are lovely in a modern, understated way. The bathroom is large and elegant, and there is a complete kitchen with high-end appliances. We stayed for six days, so we did make some use of the kitchen, and we enjoyed sitting on our balcony having coffee in the morning and wine in the evening. Spend the extra money and take a room on the ocean view side (although our room did not face the ocean directly). Those rooms face over Ft. Debussy (and some ocean), so there are no high-rises to block the view. And, you're at the very end of Waikiki, facing away from it, but a short walk puts you right in the middle of it. The room was very, very quiet; we very rarely heard any noise at all. Everything about this hotel is wonderful and no detail was so small that it had not already been anticipated and addressed. I will certainly stay there again when I'm in Honolulu. The only negative note is that the \"swimming pool\" is not much more than a lap-pool, but we didn't care about that. By the way, don't pay the hotel rate, find a discount on the internet.

I'd also like to just state that it's worth going to the Trump just to have their signature Mai Tai - it is AMAZING!!!!!! I still think about it and can't wait to return for another on later this year (hopefully!) The hotel is certainly 5 star. The staff are wonderful. We had a couple of problems during our stay - there was a mix up with our room when we arrived however it was sorted out as quickly as possible which we really appreciated after the long trip there. Also after checking out on our last day - I realised I'd left my diamond necklace in our hotel room - we returned to the hotel later that day and it was returned to me.. the cleaning staff had turned it in which I was just so grateful for! Even thought the hotel isn't on the beach, it is directly accessible by the beach access path that is directly in front of the hotel so you can quickly make your way to the beach and the stroll along the path down to the rest of town is lovely. Another feature of the hotel we were fortunate enough to try out was the spa. We made an appointment for a couples massage during our stay and both my husband and I agreed that it was the BEST massage we'd EVER had!!! It was certainly more than what we would normally spend on something like that on a weekend away - however we both agreed that we were so glad that we did.

We experienced the same friendliness and helpful service that we received a year ago. Often you will go to a hotel that once the newness wears off, service and standards begin to slip, but this is not so with the Trump Hotel Waikiki. All staff that we encountered were as professional, friendly and courteous as the first time. We particularly liked the service from the Concierge who made a recommendation to an alternate restaurant when the one we had chosen was unavailable. This new restaurant was a great alternative and will be added to our list of restaurants we visit upon our return. I do agree with other reviewers that the pool is quite small and you need to ensure that you get there early enough to get a chair in the sun. As we were there at a peak time, it can get very crowded for such a small space. It is a shame that they didn\u2019t build a larger pool but the beach is just across the road, so if you find it really annoying you can go to the beach. You are in beautiful Hawaii with wonderful beaches, so the pool isn\u2019t that important really. We had an issue with the refrigerator in our room during our stay, and someone was up promptly to check it. As we had a few things stored in the fridge and were concerned about them spoiling, we were given a temporary refrigerator until it could be fixed. We also like the turndown service so that your towels are replaced in the evening and having a bottle of water placed by your bedside is a nice touch. We received complimentary macaroons on the first night of our stay which we hadn\u2019t received on our last stay so that was a nice surprise. We really like that even though it is a large hotel, you don\u2019t feel like you are in a busy hotel. Even over the peak Christmas/New Year period, it didn\u2019t feel crowded.

On the plus side the hotel gives out complimentary water on request, gives out a beach kit (with fruit and towels etc.) a nice touch and the staff were more than friendly. The rooms are of course clean and up to a standard of a 5 star with free wifi throughout (always a plus). On my booking request I asked for a room high up and they kindly gave me a partial ocean view for no extra charge which was a nice touch. Now onto my gripe; on leaving they offered me late checkout and I stupidly asked if there was an extra charge for it and of course there is not - the person on the phone then backtracked when I showed I was keen on a late checkout (7pm) and asked me to call the frontdesk the day I was too leave to confirm (he said he would 'strongly' request for a late checkout for me)... sure enough when I called to confirm next day I'm sure they pretended to tap on the computer and quickly said that my room was already taken and I had to checkout the usual 12pm (no flexibility not even by a few more hours)....so not happy about that...would of preferred if they had not offered it in the first place rather than play games.

The staff provided exceptional service and were very friendly. The facilities were modern and high end. The property was situated near the heart of the Waikiki Beach activities.

The rooms, including the least expensive, were very well appointed and large and being a time share, there is a well equipped galley kitchen with full cooking utensils, large under counter refrigerator, microwave, 2 burner cooktop with exhaust fan. The building is situated perpendicularly to Waikiki beach so all rooms have an angled glimpse of a view of the ocean from the balcony. the first 6 floors is a parking structure so guest rooms start on the 7th floor. There is a large onsite restaurant open for breakfast and dinner. One disappointment is this property is NOT situated on the beach. It is across the street and there is a high rise hotel in the way that obstructs most of the beach view. The reason I can not rate this as a five start hotel are: 1. The public areas and lobbies are small and there is no quiet public sitting areas. 2. The pool is very small and easily taken over by 3 children. The full time pool attendant that lays out the chairs and provides cold water was an elegant touch. 3. there is no garden space or green ares on the property. The extra $30 per day for parking was an annoyance, unfortunately this seems to be standard practice for all hotels in Waikiki.

Upon our arrival, the first word we heard was \"Welcome back\" with the welcome (back?) lei. I could expect the front desk staff know this, but I did not expect this from the Bell man! The front desk staff also welcomed us again. They are friendly but at the same time they are courteous without overdoing it. What surprised us was that the person who delivered the suitcases to our room also remembered us. Their hospitality looked very genuine (even though it might be a result of the good training!) I might have already said this in the previous review but yes, the swimming pool is relatively small, so if you are expecting a pool for young kids, probably this is not the best pick. However, for frequent visitors to Hawaii or those who want to enjoy the private feeling, the pool serves it purpose. I like how it is away from the noise and crowd. Perfect place to relax, read, and enjoy a few glasses of cool drink. The service at the restaurants are good as well but the selections are relatively limited at this hotel. But you are in Honolulu - walk a few blocks, and try different restaurants.

To make matters worse, they were seeking $3 not from us, the registered guests, but from a friend who was delivering a gift. The bellman would normally receive a tip anyway so it is insulting and in very poor taste when a supposedly \u201chigh end\u201d hotel would impose such a \u201cchicken s___\u201d policy. We have stayed at the Kahala, the Sheraton Waikiki, the Hilton, and the Halekulani in past vacations and never have we felt this type of low class, nickeling and diming policy, which turns off high end visitors. Sorry for this negative comment but the hotel rates are high enough, without trying to pick up a few extra pennies here and there with this type of irritating policy. And what hurts and infuriated us is that they pulled it on two separate occasions. The first when friends tried to send up a gift parcel, when the hotel security would not permit them to go above the 6th floor for a personal delivery. The second when a delivery service tried to deliver a bottle of cough medicine for my daughter. So, Trump, please wake up before it is too late, as negative news travels quickly. We were excited and anticipated a classy and first class facility with the Trump name and reputation but our dreams were for naught. We even voiced our concerns to the Bell Desk Manager, a Ms. Kawai Yamashiro, but she only became defensive and tried to justify the practice by indicating that the bellmen receive very low pay, and that all the major hotels impose this charge for delivery to the rooms \u2013 NOT TRUE. And the excuse about low wages for Bellmen is also in poor taste. After al, this is a TRUMP project, so you would expect that staff is better trained and should be paid more than the common hotels. These small things do add up \u2013 especially when you start nickeling and diming your guests.

We then passed by the hotel before our departure and see if the stuffy had turned up. Then I was lucky enough to be helped by Julia. She went in and out to ask all department and after 15 minutes, she has found the stuffy. That saved my son's day. That was his favourite stuffy.

From a scale perspective, the Trump is not one of those large resorts you can find in Waikiki like the Hilton or the Sheraton. Instead, it's a luxury hotel that has a couple of restaurants / bars and that's it. If you prefer that kind of scale, you will like this place. The most noticeable aspect of the Trump is the service, which is top notch. It reflects an attention to detail that you will see as you walk around the place. Everyone - I mean everyone - who works here is friendly and greets you with a smile and an \"Aloha\". Concierges on the ground floor are friendly and helpful. The hotel is across the street from Fort DeRussy Beach Park, a two minute walk away. We stayed in a \"20\" room, which was a studio room with a city view and partial ocean view. The room has a modern marble kitchen, spacious bathroom and very comfortable king size bed with a nice, soft mattress cover that makes you want to lie in bed for hours. There's also a sofa and coffee table. The room was very clean, bigger than we expected (probably around 450 square feet), and looked brand new. We liked the layout of the room, because when you enter it you're in the kitchen area, which sort of acts as a foyer that provides around 15 feet of privacy and separation between the front door and the living room area. You actually can't see the bed from the front door. The ceilings were lower than I expected. When I used the treadmill in the gym, I was afraid of hitting my head on the ceiling (I didn't, and I'm 6'2\"). A few suggestions about staying here: 1. Hang out by the infinity pool and read a book. You can order drinks there, and they turn on the lights when it gets dark if you want to keep reading. 2. You can tell the housekeeping staff what time you want them to clean your room. 3. You can choose your pillows. Ask at the check-in desk. 4. The gym is smallish but not bad, especially if you use the treadmill or elliptical. They also offer free headphones in case you forget yours. 5.

I'm very glad we stayed here as it was the nicest hotel in our 2 week holiday. We had just stayed at the Trump in Las Vegas the week prior, so it was good to compare both hotels (I will write another review them soon!) We booked our accommodation using www.otel.com about 4 months prior and booked a Deluxe Ocean View Studio. My parents booked their accommodation only 3 weeks prior and paid $800 more that we did for a Superior Ocean View Studio (through www.zuji.com.au), which was a significantly smaller room, so be aware the Deluxe Vs Superior rooms are different. My parents loved their room in any case, but we were glad we booked a bit earlier, getting a cheaper price and a HUGE room. In our room, we got two double beds (instead of a queen bed) which ended up being great as our room felt much bigger having the extra bed. The room quality (lounge, tv, bed linen, towels, pillows etc) was excellent, and we had lovely views (even though we were on the 12th floor, the sunset was spectacular!) and having a full kitchen to make breakfast/snacks in every day made a big difference. We didnt end up paying any Resort Fee's either. The only downside was, our toilet kept getting blocked (every day for 5 days straight), so it was a bit annoying, but not overly so as housekeeping were literally there within 10 minutes to fix it and we were always heading out the door so it really didnt bother us. They do a full housekeeping service twice a day, once in the morning to change bed linen/towels and when we came back from dinner each night, they had done a turn-down service as well, and replaced any wet towels in the bathroom. We loved having our room so clean and fresh all the time. We hired a car for the week (which we highly recommend) and the valet staff were fantastic, always offering us directions and bottles of water. The concierge also gave us day bags with fresh towels, water, pieces of fruit and sunscreen \u2013 this was a big plus for a few day trips we did. We swam in the pool about 4 times during our stay (some days were a bit overcast/cool - hey it was winter!), but be aware that most of the lounge beds were full by the lunch/afternoon crowd. If you\u2019re there early enough in the mornings (say around 7-8am), the pool area was almost empty, so we stuck to morning swims. We ate at BLT which I would only give a 5/10 as we all found ours steaks REALLY SALTY but the service was excellent and we enjoyed their Popover Bread rolls, they were great! I would definitely stay in the Trump again \u2013 for the extra $500 we paid to stay at Trump compared to perhaps staying at other hotels/resorts I looked at on Tripadvisor, we certainly felt we got value for the extra money. My Top 3 dinning suggestions close by: 1) Taormina Sicilian Restaurant (227 Lewers St) about 8-10 min walk from Trump (we ate here twice) 2) The Beachhouse (inside the Moana Surfrider hotel) about 15-20 min walk from Trump (make a booking!!) 3) Eggs N Things (343 Saratoga Road ) only 2 min walk from Trump (breakfast was the best, but be prepared to wait 30-45 mins for a table, at ANY time during the day, they are flat out)", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201csimply 10!\u201d", "Author": "oldbutcool", "ReviewID": "UR121717150", "Content": "i have never stayed in any top tier hotel other than the Four Seasons on my wedding day, so i have nothing to compare the Trump hotel in HI to, but i can only state that its staff's friendly and considerate service define perfection.

It was simply the most magnificent hotel we have ever experienced! When we arrived we were greeted with shell leis and personal escort to the main lobby for a quick and efficient check in. On arrival at our room, which was a deluxe ocean view studio, we were treated to a gift of chilled Prosecco and a welcoming note about our stay. The room had two queen beds, a sleeper sofa, an amazing bathroom with open shower, tub, and twin vanities, and a fully stocked kitchen. The view from the room was combined ocean and city, with the room facing Fort DeRussy Park. The view was absolutely magnificent and lends itself to spectacular sunset watching and a front row seat for the fireworks on Friday nights. We were on the 19th floor and this level was nice to lessen some of the traffic noise when the sliding window was open. Speaking of the lanai, it was a great size for us, and we spent our mornings with coffee there each day. We left the door open nearly all the time when we were in the room, and if there was too much noise, the sliding door completely eliminated it. In our opinion, the location of this hotel is perfect because it sits adjacent to Fort DeRussy, is off the beach a little bit, and is on the Beach Walk. Being adjacent to Fort DeRussy allows for the wonderful ocean, park, and city views. Being one row back from the beach insulates you from the hustle and bustle of the beach, but keeps you close enough to walk to the beach in just a couple of minutes. Lastly, being on the Beach Walk gives you quick and easy access to restaurants, shopping, and people-watching, and that ended up being a nightly ritual for us! The hotel facility outside the room itself is also wonderful. When we first experienced the lobby and caf\u00e9 level on the 6th floor, we really felt like the view was a photograph, it was so pleasing. The openness of the building really accentuates the tropical feel. We enjoyed some pool time one day when it was really windy, and found that the pool area is a good break against the wind and gives you the option of sun or shade. While we didn\u2019t actually use the pool, it looked very inviting. As mentioned in other reviews, it is NOT designed for children to spend the day there. It is perfect for adult exercise in the morning and transitions to relaxing sunset watching with a cocktail in the evening! The Staff: Every single person on the staff of this hotel was superb. Their desire to make your stay memorable and perfect was evident in every interaction. One of the most outstanding staff members was Dean, the valet captain. He was particularly helpful and friendly, and we stayed and talked with him for more than a few minutes each day. He was always interested in what our plans were for the day and had great advice as a local to our travels. Dean is a true ambassador for both the hotel and Hawaii! Another outstanding member of the staff was Keile (spelling?) who helped us in the In-Yo\u2019 Caf\u00e9. She was extremely helpful, friendly, and welcoming. These two are just a sample of the staff and every one of them deserves the biggest thanks for the atmosphere they create! For all the negative reviewers, we just don\u2019t agree. Everything we have ever read that was negative is either information you can obtain while researching the hotel or we simply didn\u2019t experience. The rooms are spacious and open. We didn\u2019t experience any issues with the open shower. We knew about the pool and its focus toward adults, which is what we wanted. It isn\u2019t too far from the beach. The staff was outstanding and not intrusive or fake. The valet parking is a known charge from the website and is an outstanding service. If you don\u2019t want it, park across the street at the Hale Koa open lot for a fee. All in all, this hotel is even more than we anticipated.

I thought it'd be expensive, a bit garish, ostentatious, tacky. I couldn't have been more wrong. From the second we arrived I was in love and began writing this review in my head - although by now it'll probably come out a little more crudely. The Trump Waikiki is one of the most comfortable, high standard hotels I've ever stayed in. The property, rooms, facilities, services and service is all so ergonomically designed you keep saying to yourself - \"if I ran a hotel this is exactly how I'd want to do it\". The property itself is beautiful. It is so well designed and the styling reminded me of some of the Asian hotels I love - as did the service. Being greeted with a lei was a nice touch. Check-in was very, very smooth. Service throughout was what made this hotel exceptional. I love hotels in SE Asia because they get good service - the Trump reminded me of these. The staff are all so incredibly passionate about what they do and it shows. They all seem to be one step away from knowing your name without asking. The rooms were fantastic - comfortable, large, well-designed and ready for anything. The kitchen stands out at first - they're fully equipped with everything you could need. It was weird, but actually something I wish every hotel did! The bathroom was really good and had a huge, deep bath. The toiletries were very high quality too which was nice. I wish I'd stolen a dressing gown as it was the softest I've ever used. We were on a low floor and had a \"partial sea view\" but to be honest it didn't matter. I think all rooms have pretty great views no matter what they're of. Go to the pool area at sunset for some of the most beautiful ones you'll ever see. The bed was very comfortable and they had a pillow menu which you could use. I slept so incredibly well during my stay and the room was so peaceful. The huge TV was great and helped add to the modern feel of the place. The night time turn-down service was inpeccable and one of the things they do which makes the place stand out. The gym was small but contained all I needed - treadmills, free weights, bikes and two weight machines. The Pocari Sweat and cucumber/lemon water dispensers were a great touch. The pool area was so good we spent most of every day there. It's in a great location to get sun all day and the loungers are very comfortable. The pool itself is really nice for a dip and you get great views from the whole area. Although relatively small, the area never filled up completely, and most people seemed to come for a while before heading off out, probably to the beach. I didn't bother with the beach once as the pool was so great. The pool staff really make the place so great though - they can't do enough to help. They brought around mini smoothies a couple of times too which was fantastic. They also provide free sunblock which, once again, is one of those touched which makes the Trump so special. The Mai Tai they serve claims to be the best out there - and I think it actually is. The worst thing about the hotel was the elevators - they were rather slow. However, we did stay there during APEC and the Indonesian delegation were staying with us which caused the delays. Back to the staff once more - they are all amazing. The sense of pride they exude really makes this a special place to stay. I remember hearing Donald Trump once say something about his hotels delivering the service and amenities he's always wanted to be given when staying away from home.

I would actually recommend this side of the hotel as you get the best of both, the ocean and the Honolulu skyline at night (and also the Friday fireworks!).

If you've stayed at one Trump Hotel, you come to expect a certain level of service an amenities. Here's where the mark was missed just a bit. Upon arrival, we pulled in behind a Jaguar and we were driving a small rental. Well guess who got the attention of two bellmen/doormen? My wife opened her own door and I was able to retrieve my luggage from the trunk before we were greeted. This generally doesn't happen at a Trump. Guess I need to rent a Jag the next time.

Never has the reception agent left her desk, escorted us to the elevator, waited for it to arrive, loaded us, pressed the button and sent us on our way. WOW!!! The rooms are a very nice size, appointed with top of the line(Sub Zero/Wolf) amenities and were SPOTLESS. We were happy with our view from the 17th floor of the ocean. The shower was strong and had very consistent hot water. Bedding was VERY comfortable and cozy. Another great touch was upon checkout, we indicated that we had a late flight and the reception area extend to us the use of hospitality room until we were due to fly out.

Get the multi-day pass from the Hale Koa parking garage structure for $16/day.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Observatory Point Bed & Breakfast", "Title": "\u201cThe best of both worlds...\u201d", "Author": "misslily0", "ReviewID": "UR120087469", "Content": "Located on the quiet side of Waikiki, a smaller hotel with what I would call simple elegance, the Trump Waikiki was a perfect place to call home.

The pool side services is also very good and the attendee was very helpful and efficient. The only issue I found with the hotel was that it was located on the end of Waikiki Beach with a bit more shore fringing reef (than say Royal Hawaiian / Out Rigger etc.).

We booked on the stay 4 nights and get the 4th night free deal so we ended up getting a pretty good price especially compared to the other places we stayed considering how much better the Trump was! The hotel was at full occupancy when we stayed here but did not feel crowded or too busy. All the staff are so nice, from the bellmen to the concierge to reception and even the housekeeping staff is always smiling and friendly. The service here is top notch. We stayed in a deluxe studio city view which ended up having a bit of a view of Waikiki beach from the lanai. The rooms are nice \u2013 clean and modern with small Hawaiian touches. The beds are so comfortable and the sheets really soft\u2026even the towels in the bathroom were Egyptian cotton. We received fresh towels twice a day and they always provided more than enough. Turndown service is very good \u2013 they really pay attention to detail at the Trump. The room was super clean \u2013 housecleaning did a fantastic job, and the hotel itself is still in new condition. We found a pretty big bug in the room on our last day but it probably crawled in from the lanai or the hallway \u2013 not too sure.

We were prepared for this as you can easily tell from the pictures of the pool that it is small. We only used it on our last day after we checked out and for the rest of our stay, we went to the beach (took advantage of the complimentary pool bags from concierge). The beach is across the street, probably a 2 minute walk. The sand at Waikiki is softest in front of the Sheraton/Royal Hawaiian hotels and is worth the short treck. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who won\u2019t be fussed about a small pool. It is in a fantastic location being within short walking distance of Waikiki beach, beachwalk and much of the shopping and restaurants.

It is brand new so the rooms are in really good condition and everything is immaculate. The house service is brilliant; towels changed twice a day, turn down service in the evenings, they even did our dishes! Easy to get used to and lovely to come home to after a day at the beach or exploring. Also nice to have the water bottles constantly replenished. The bathrobes are fab ($130 if you want to buy one, and I was very tempted!) and the beds are really really comfortable. Nice view from the balcony. Good location, very close to the beach and all shops and restaurants. Perfect for a young couple on honeymoon. The staff are very friendly but sometimes I did find it a little false. The hotel promotes its Attache service which is designed to personalise the guest's experience but we didn't experience the 'personal' touch. We had told the hotel we were on honeymoon prior to our arrival, and there was a lovely bottle of Prosecco in the room waiting for us, however, I found out after that my sister had tried to organise this for us, and it was only after she phoned the hotel that they said they would put something in the room. I'm not complaining about a freebie - it just seems to me that they should have already known that was why were were staying because I had filled in the forms that they sent to us which were designed to personalise our experience. I know it is picking, because the staff were friendly, but I have worked in hotels for years and I found their personal touch lacking, particularly in the welcome and the goodbye. There are a few wee things that we think it is important for people to consider when booking this hotel. 1) The pool is very small. This wasn't a problem for us but it was full of kids and I can't imagine why anyone would take kids to this hotel. It can't have been much fun for them and their games, whilst not an issue, would have been better in a larger resort hotel. 2) The bar isn't very lively. Not an issue because there are lots of other lively bars in the vicinity but if you are looking for a hotel with a vibrant nightlife, this isn't it. 3) It is expensive! I made the mistake of asking for a jug of milk for coffee and it cost me $28!! Bit steep. Overall though, we would definitely go back for the room alone.

Our best sun destination hotel stay EVER!!!\u201d", "Author": "snowBoardBunny", "ReviewID": "UR118542725", "Content": "The hotel's reputation for service does live up to the hype! We got a hotel+flight deal online and it was a fantastic deal compared to getting the room direct. We had already decided on a different hotel, when one last search yielded this one at a price point and airline that was acceptable to us. This price was actually about $50 better than staying at a 4-star in the Waikiki area...so why wouldn't we try this one since it's ranked number one on Tripadvisor! We arrived and felt welcomed. No different treatment than other reviewers even though we got the great promo rate. There was a high quality, thick white shell lei greeting for me and a thick kukui nut lei for my spouse. We were conducted to the hotel checkin lobby from the taxi drop off, by Linda who was courteous, interested in our travels, and polite. During our seamless checkin, Linda even reappeared with a cold glass of fruit infused water and a cool facecloth infused with lemongrass. That was a wonderful greeting after a 9.5 hour flight! We were even upgraded from a city view room to a partial ocean view room on the 12th floor. There are too many things to love about the hotel, so I'll just list our absolute faves in point form: 1. Large studio suite and bathrooms, although the bathroom lacked for counter space with just the semi-pedestal sink. 2. Turn down service nightly. We only got treats on the first night of our week long stay, but it was displayed artistically and tasted yummy. 3. The beach bag service they offer at the attach\u00e9 desk on the ground floor was awesome! We used it for our snorkel, underwater scooter trip, and our lazy morning on Waikiki beach day! You have to return the bag and the towels when you return, but they include cold water, fresh fruit, and pro sunblock that blends on smoothly as if it were moisturizer. One of the best sunblocks I've ever used. 4. The 12 item pillow menu... In case you don't like their 50/50 poly/down blend, they have ones that are allergy free, comfortable for neck, comfortable for hip, knee, etc. They also half a dozen scented ones to relieve stress or to energize you or restore balance. Look for the menu on the same tray as the laundry services. 5. Soft comfortable king sized beds. No trouble sleeping at all while we were there. 6. Friendly and courteous staff. 7. Responsive housekeeping. --- they brought up extra toilet paper and tissues within 5 minutes of the call down. 8. Loved the included lanai balcony, where we enjoyed sunrise and breakfasts every morning. 9. Everyone working there was mindful of our comfort and enjoyment. Several times, the staff even waited for the next elevator, so we could have an unencumbered ride down. Always, the staff were anticipating our needs... Like the busgirl who offered to take our photo on the lobby floor while sunset was happening and we had our camera poised. 10. Location! Location! LOCATION! It is on the same street as stops for the Waikiki Trolley, the hop on/ hop off double decker tour bus, and various tour bus pickup sites. You can walk 1 minute to Waikiki beach(although this may not be a prime beach spot), less than 2 minutes to area restaurants or ABC stores, 4 minutes to the Royal Hawaiian shopping mall, 5 minutes to Duty Free shopping mall, 10 minutes to the other side of Waikiki beach nearer to the zoo and aquarium (but probably more like 20 minutes to actually get there). A few small things that could have been better: 1. On one of our snorkel tours, we were 5th in line at the attach\u00e9 desk, but all we wanted was the beach bag... Someone had valet parked their car(which I believe is the only option), and was retrieving it, and managed to get one of the bellboys to grab a couple of beach bags for him. We then asked him to retrieve a bag for us. At that busy time in the morning(7:15-7:25am), there should be more than one person staffing the attach\u00e9 desk. We were afraid we would miss our appointed bus pick up time in the lineup. Behind us were another dozen people. All of them were Japanese, so they may have been too afraid to step out of line to ask someone else for a beach bag - I hope they didn't miss their bus tour that morning. That was the only morning where there was any kind of lineup at the attach\u00e9 desk while we were there. 2. The studios don't have a full closet, only half. The top half is used for spare towels, pillows, vanity mirror, hair dryer. If you have a full sized dress, it will not hang full length. Luckily, I only had a 3/4 length, which just fit. 3. The writing desk came with a dried up pen. When I listen to the welcome message from The attach\u00e9 desk, I had no writing implement with which to take her name and number. A later call for a new pen remedied the problem with two new pens after a day. 4. The shower is very Asian/tropical style, with removal shower heads and located beside the tub, but with no door to stop from spraying onto floor. You can minimize wetness to bathroom floor by angling away and by putting the bath matt down in front of the tiles. It wasn't a problem for us, since we've used this style of shower before, but something robe aware of. 5. Internet was spotty. It worked well at the spot on the sofa just in front of our lanai balcony, and on the bed near the desk. We both had mobile devices, not a hardwired connection. On Friday nights, the Hilton has fireworks. We watched from Wai'olua restaurant on 6th floor lanai seating. You need to make reservations via the concierge/attach\u00e9 service. They were very helpful. I'll do a write up for the restaurant separately, but our server was Kiele and she was awesome. Helpful in suggestions, and mindful of all my allergies and food intolerances. The chef even changed up a couple of menu items so I could have them! The fireworks were amazing and surprisingly loud from that vantage point. We had already committed to the GO Oahu Card before picking the Trump, otherwise, I would have loved to use their legendary attach\u00e9 services to book our outings. The GO card worked well for us, so we stuck with them for other bookings not covered by the GO card. Overall, it was the best hotel we have ever stayed at. If you can find a great deal, then it is definitely worth it over any 4 or 5- star hotel or resort that you could stay at. Even without a great online deal, the Trump Waikiki just may become our splurge hotel of choice. :-)", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellevue, Washington", "Title": "\u201cNot up to the hype\u201d", "Author": "mochipuppy", "ReviewID": "UR118454422", "Content": "I think part of the reason that I was disappointed in this hotel was because of all the wonderful reviews I read on TripAdvisor of how this Trump goes above and beyond. I built a really high expectation of the service and their attention to detail that sadly were not met. There were no strawberry infused water upon arriving at the hotel for check in, no complimentary upgrade even though we were celebrating our anniversary and no snacks/drinks left by housekeeping each day. Turn down service was performed at 9:24pm, way too late for people dealing with jet lag. Some of the fruit given in the beach bag were rotting already. We basically got exactly what we paid for and nothing else. I also used their spa service and was shocked how tiny it was. Last time I was at a 5 star hotel spa was at Encore in Vegas. The difference is night and day. There is no sauna, dry steam room, jacuzzi, whirlpool etc. Just a couple of small treatment rooms. The massage itself was also not as great as the one at Encore. Upon paying for the service, I found out that the price was actually $35 higher than the spa brochure in my room because it was an outdated one. The spa wasn't able to fully honor the price difference and I didn't feel like arguing in front out other guests who were there to relax. Only upon checking out did I mention it to the front desk, who then finally sorted it out with the spa the next day. I was refunded the entire amount for my troubles. I appreciated the gesture, but wished they could've just given me the old brochure price at the time so I wouldn't have felt uneasy for the rest of my stay. I believe the reason Trump is ranked #1 hotel on TA is because it goes above and beyond people's expectations. For me, it met my basic expectations but nothing beyond that. The nicest part of this hotel was the valet, who would turn on the GPS for us when retrieving the car knowing that it takes a few min to receive signal.

It is correct that the property is not right on the beach - it is a one block walk along a path through a park-like area. We saw this as a plus because it seems like the beach could get loud with partiers at night. The Trump hotel is lovely. Clean, warm contemporary interior. Very well maintained. I reserved a 1 bedroom and was upgraded to a two bedroom with two full baths and a full sized, fully equipped kitchen. It was awesome. I could live in this space. It was so nice I was inspired to cook a full meal with the live shrimp we purchased from Fumi's on the North Shore. The room was very clean and maid service was excellent - albeit one evening we had to call to find out when turn-down would occur.

We had chosen this hotel after many weeks reading reviews. Loved the idea that they are kid friendly, and so on...I had emailed the hotel after we booked and advised this was our honeymoon. They had upgraded us to a suite, which was beautiful! Cookies for my son and a bottle of champagne for us....very nice. We are not wealthy people at all. When I say we treated ourselves to this trip, I mean it was quiet an expensive stay for 4 days....totalled $2000! Would we stay here again, no. Not for the money that we spent and the extra costs we incurred. It really isn't on the stip and there is nothing that really made us say, wow, we will def come back. we have stayed in a lot of nice properties, but for the Trump experience, I expected to be WOWED! We arrived at night, and it was perfect to get to a hotel where you felt comforatble and relaxed. Service was always friendly and helpful esp. the concierage. She gave us tons of info and local tips for our day trip to the North Shore, as we had a rental the entire trip. The \"Beach\"....what a joke! We were advised that the Trump has a beach area, so we decided to go and spend some time there. The beach bag that they lend you was nice. filled with water, apples, sunscreen and towels. They advise you to walk across the road and it will be clearly marked. Well, when we arrived at the beach, with the 2000 other people, we were quiet taken back. It was rows and rows and ROWS of beach chairs that are clusted into different colored groups, that are 3 inches apart from each other. So after walking a bit, and a vendor finally noticing our Trump bag, asked if we were looking for the Trump area. He advised that there were only 2 chairs left (near the back) and that the daily fee is going to be $35...it was 4 in th afternoon!!! So after all that work we tried to settle in and my husband and son went to play in the water, only to find them more just sitting on the shore. The sand was so rough, it was more like small rocks. All of our feet had scrpaes and cuts on them from trying to stand in that area. We stayed 20 minutes, and I went back to the rental desk and asked if we really had to pay the full $35 dollars, as we were laeving due to the overcrowding and condition of the \"sand\"...he was nice enought to say that he wouldn't bill our room, and advised us to check out the north shore.....So dont bother going to the beach.... The pool on the other hand was nice, for our size of family, and out needs. It has 3 small waddling pools, which my son loved! and was cleaned everyday! Small, yes, but did the job. One day, a staff member came out with frozen (but fresh) fruit for everyone in little plastic cups. They have lemon/lime water avasilable there, with disposable swim pampers for the little ones, and warm towels. I LOVED THE POOL! The Spa.... We treated ourselves to couples package for a massage. We both went at different times beacuase we didnt want to leave our son. My husband loved it, and I didn't. I;m a regular for massages, and had better. At the time I was 6 months pregnant, and had the pregnancy massage. It was quiet akward. She talked to me the entire time, which i found nice at first, but I really just wanted to relax. Maybe it was because it was my first prenatal massage that I didnt enjoy it..But I was talked into these \"fabulous\" pregnancy products which had a nice scent. Now that I am using them, there is nothing special about them....When you are done, they kindly ask you, with a HUGE smile on your face, \"Is it alright if we add a 30% gratuity to your bill?\" Like really, who's going to say no? So on a $200 massage, your are tipping $60! On the menu, it says that its a manditory fee.... One day my husband found a tylenol in my sons mouth while we were in our room. We dont use the stuff so it didnt belong to us. I called the front desk and advised them. She appologized, and later housekeeping came up to \"inspect\" the room and interview us. I let her know where he probably found it, and she wanted to come in and check the rest of the room. I advised that it wasnt required, and she agreed and left. But that was the end of that....Being an over protective mother, I just expected more of an appology, or something to make of for what could have been a really bad situation. After this incident, I really just couldn't wait to get to Maui.... So there it is.

Beach access is across the street and the shops & dining of Beachwalk and Royal Hawaiian SC is less than a 5-10 minute walk.

We checked-in when there was a fashion show going on at the pool and the entrance was an absolute zoo...Also on Sunday morning (8/28 7:15 am) when returning to the property, the Bell Captain and Concierge on duty, failed to acknowledge me when I parked right in front of their desk. They were having a conversation, but believe me, it wasn't work related.

It is also well situated to use public transportation. The pool is on the lobby level so you get a very nice city view. The pool has more of an urban hotel feel rather than beach feel, so it may not be as suitable for children. The only downside to the hotel was housekeeping. They did a less than superb job cleaning. The day we arrived, we discovered broken glass fragments on the kitchen floor. Also, I noticed that dishes that they washed still had remnants of food left on them.

As usual with these sort of hotels, there is a online concierge questionnaire which enquires about needs etc and if travelling with children. We were, 2 infact (8 and 5yr). On arrival we were nicely greeted and the children were certainly made to feel special. At reception as we were signing in, ice water with melon infusion was brought out with towel to freshen up for all. The staff were always helpful and courteous. Never really felt the pressure to tip for everything... but I have to say the service was indeed very good and any gratuity they received was deserved. The rooms are exactly as portrayed in the photos and the lounge and dining area are spacious and tastefully furnished. The views were indeed ocean view especially so from the living area and master bed. Superb. There was a small balcony which we did not really use. The kitchen was well equipped. Washer/dryer of course important for children. Oh on the first day, children both received a soft toy, drawing and coloring book and also 4 stylish \"shots\" of juices and milkshake for their arrival in the room when we got there. Very thoughtful to our daily stay. Gourmet cookies as well. Other days of room service, chocolates etc was also left. My only complain was that they tended to have these very horribly tea infusion thing, and left very few plain black teabags. Nevertheless, room service fixed that when called. They have the usual Wii available when asked for (ie we were informed of the available entertainments for children) in a \"menu\" on arrival. Asked for a Wii and they came and set up the unit for you. Kept the kids happy. The rooms cannot be fault. Free high speed Wifi. The hotel had a small pool which is not really suitable for children (4 ft deep) and that was really their only weak point. But when you have the ocean, well let's say we were mostly at the beach. The location is good, right in the centre of Waikiki, numerous convenient store nearby, close to the beach. It is literally one block back from the beach. If you walk a bit up the beach it becomes less rough and more suitable for children. They do provide a simple day beach bag... ie towels and sunscreen as well as water, which is great. At the end of your day, just hand it back! Being in the centre, you are surrounded by restaurants, take you pick. Roy's was pretty good. All in all, a lovely place, superb apartments (they are listed on the market for about 2 to 2.5 million, if you fancy buying one) and we would definitely stay there again.

From check-in to check-out the service was superb but I would stress that this is a hotel geared for couples and groups of adults, rather than families with young kids. The design of the pool looks fantastic but is long and thin and not geared up for kids to be splashing around. The space around the pool is also very limited and once again designed for adults to relax rather than for kids to run around. We stayed in a deluxe ocean view studio on the 20th floor with incredible views (Room 2017), which overlooked the ocean on one side and the mountains on the other. I highly recommended requesting this room or 2117, 2217 or 2317. The room was tastefully decorated and featured a small living area with a large flat screen TV and also an iPod dock. When booking, I deliberated whether to upgrade to a one bedroom but the studios are so spacious I'm glad I didn't spend the extra money. Our balcony provided us with a front row seat for the Friday night fireworks, which was a lovely experience after a long flight from Sydney. The well equipped kitchen is a fantastic bonus and by stocking up on breakfast things at the ABC store around the corner, we enjoyed breakfast on our balcony each morning and bypassed the expensive room service and cafe crowds. The king size bed was very comfortable (we named it 'the cloud') and there is a pillow menu if you are not happy with the selection on the bed. The spacious modern bathroom includes a large shower, deep bath and double sinks. Even though the hotel is one street back from the beach, it really doesn't make any difference because you have the lovely ocean views from your balcony and the walk to the beach is literally a couple of minutes. When heading to the beach, ask the Concierge for a complimentary Trump beach bag, which includes swimming towels, cold water and fresh fruit - a lovely touch! We didn't eat at the hotel (although I'm sure it would be excellent) but we did have dinner at Nobu (okay service, great food but expensive - over US$400 for 2 people), which is a 5 min walk from the hotel and Orchid's at the Halekulani Hotel (also a 5 min walk), which was also very nice. We also had dinner at Dukes (a Waikiki institution), which was a lot of fun. The hotel is more than happy to make bookings and we had fantastic tables at all 3 restaurants. Depending on how long you are going to be staying in Waikiki, I would recommend hiring a car for a couple of days and driving to Pearl Habour and then onto the Waikele Premium Factory Outlets (15 min drive on from Pearl Harbour) and then on the second day head up to the North Shore (and the famous Sunset Beach aka Pipeline). We hired a convertible Mustang through www.discounthawaiicarrental.com, which was great fun! After our time in Waikiki, we headed over to Maui for a week and only wish Trump would open a hotel on that island, as they are crying out for a luxury, small leading hotel in the Lahaina area.

Check- in: We arrived at 11 am and were greeted warmly by the head porter and his team and escorted to the lobby on the 6th flr. The staff were very welcoming with leis and coconut infused water while we checked in. As we'd requested an early check in we were happy to wait 20 minutes in the outdoor bar area while our suite was prepared. Suite: our rooms ( 2 bed plus den) were on the 24th flr with a partial ocean view/city view. Immediate impression of the suite was of spaciousness and cleanliness. Great fully stocked kitchen along with dining table and chairs. The lounge consisted of a large couch and armchairs and large flatscreen tv and coffee table and was adjacent to the main balcony (lanai). The den was a small alcove separated from the lounge area by the dining table and chairs and consisted of a large couch (that doubled as a fold out bed) and a chest of drawers. The main bedroom had a separate toilet, walk in robe, and large shower with a separate huge bath tub. The second bedroom was smaller but offered a private balcony (lanai) and a decent sized bathroom (shower only and toilet). Off the entrance was the laundry (washer and dryer) and third bathroom consisting of a shower and toilet. This was the smallest bathroom but still a good size. All bathrooms were stocked with the Spa at Trump branded toiletries including body wash, body lotion, shampoo, conditioner, scrub, shower cap, mouthwash and facial soap. These toiletries were excellent quality. The beds were sooooo comfortable with fresh crisp white linen sheets and great pillows. We utilised the fold out couch in the den and this too was comfortable (not as comfortable and soft as the bed, but definitely better than the standard fold out experience). We liked the nightly turn down service and the attention the housekeeping staff took to lay out the robes and slippers and prepare our beds. We found every day that either bottles of water or chocolates were left in our suite by housekeeping which offered a nice touch. We also appreciated the very nice bottle of complimentary champagne left in our suite as a birthday gift from management. Service: overall we found the service to be excellent, in particular the concierge and the staff at the Wai'olu ocean view lounge restaurant on the 6th floor. We dined there a couple of times and really took a liking to the mai tais! Michael and Christopher were great wait staff and provided us with lots of suggestions about sights and attractions to check out during our stay. Happy hour is from 4-6 pm daily and although the mai tais aren't included in happy hour prices, there is an excellent vodka cocktail to enjoy instead called Stars on the Water. Mmmmm. Restaurants: we had dinner at both the Wai'olu ocean view lounge and the BLT on the ground floor. Food and service at both were excellent. We were given a complimentary birthday dessert at the Wai'olu when the wait staff heard we were celebrating our birthdays. Facilities: we used the gym a few times which had treadmills, bikes and free weights together with a couple of weight machines. There are headphones available to use with the treadmills and bikes and filtered water. The gym is quite small though (only 2 bikes) and could get crowded. Other: the only downside of staying in our beautiful suite was the daily battle to open the sliding door to the main balcony off the lounge area. This was a heavy glass door that took some effort to open and close each time. Another issue came when one of my friends, sleeping in the second bedroom, wanted to sleep with her balcony door open so she could enjoy the sound of the surf. However as we found out the next morning, if either balcony door is left open, the airconditioning for the entire suite switches off, and we had to get housekeeping to get it working again. The evening turn down service was inconsistent and a couple of times we had to call to ask for this service. Also the pool size - as noted by other reviewers- is very small. Its a beautiful infinity pool on the 6th floor but the small size means it gets crowded very quickly. Location: the beach is a very quick walk from the Trump, less than 5 minutes. We found the location perfect as it was near the beach and main shopping area. Around the corner is an ABC store to stock up on food and drink. We jumped in a cab to the Ala Moana shopping center to get most of our groceries at the supermarket there. We felt very safe and comfortable walking to and from the Trump late at night as the area is well lit and populated. Suggestions: grab the beach bags (available from the concierge desk on the ground floor) when heading to the beach. The bags come with towels, fruit and bottled water. We emailed the Trump prior to arriving to request some advice about activities and restaurants and were sent a detailed list of suggestions which came in handy when planning what to do each day.

We were upgraded to a large one-bedroom ocean view suite upon check-in. The room finishes and features were exceptional and worthy of a 5-star hotel. Unfortunately, the suite was on a lower floor, which can make for lots of noise at night in any hotel in Waikiki's concrete hotel canyons. The hotel is one block from the beach overlooking Fort Derussy Park. You can see the beach, but you can't hear the waves, which is always disappointing in Hawaii. If there was anything that struck me about this property it is that the resort facilities are somewhat small and lacking in features. The gym is very small and does not have a sauna. The roof top infinity pool is a modest affair on the fifth floor with not much room for sunning--a major drawback for a non-beach front hotel. The food at the hotel's two restaurants was pretty average and the breakfast buffet was, again, small, and lacking in variety. Overall, we had a lovely experience, but at these prices, you expect more, particularly when compared to the hotels across the street. For slightly more money, you could go with the Halekulani and be assured of a 5-star experience or save a significant amount of money and stay at the Outrigger Reef for a better location and larger guest facilities.

Because of all the rave reviews on Tripadvisor, I wanted to check out the hotel for myself and possibly book a group rate for my wedding guests next year. Here are my comments on the stay: Welcome: Upon arrival, you are given nice shell leis, a cold towel, and a glass of fruit-infused cold water. The very friendly staff will walk you up to the 6th floor lobby for check in. Walking into our air conditioned room with Hawaiian music on, we were greeted by a tray of chocolate-covered strawberries and two cold waters in the fridge. Upgrades: Although I heard that you can usually get upgraded at check-in, this didn't happen for us. No harm though since that would have just been an added bonus. Parking: Valet parking is $28/night. I always called down for my car before leaving my room, and it was usually waiting for us when we came down. When picking up your car in the morning, your car will always be supplied with cold bottled water - a very nice detail. The driveway did get quite busy during the day and you sometimes had to wait for shuttle buses, limos, or other cars to move before you could get out. Room: The rooms are wonderful at the Trump. I did a site inspection for my wedding and visited most of the room categories. Every room is very spacious and has a kitchenette or full kitchen (based on the size). For larger groups, the 1bdrm + den (sleeps 6; 1.5 bath), 2 bdrm (sleeps 6; 2.5 bath), and 2 bdrm + den (sleeps 8; 2.5 bath) are really great value and they won't charge you for the additional guests. The studio city view room was smaller than our partial ocean view room and both didn't include lanais. Our room - and all rooms on the south side - directly face the Outrigger Hotel next door whose guests like to hang out on their patios. Make sure to close your curtains if you want privacy!! I do also wish that the view would be more direct on the ocean, but since the hotel is not on the beach and blocked by the hotels around it, you only see a diagonal view. Housekeeping: Service in this area is great. Our room was always kept very clean and tidy with housekeeping and nightly turn down service. They even wash all of your dishes for you. They also replace used towels and clean during turn down service as well so it is like getting your room cleaned twice a day. Dining - Breakfast: Like any hotel breakfast, it's not that cheap ($60 for two). The view consists of mostly the pool below it and the Outrigger Hotel next door. One qualm is that we arrived at 8am when it was empty except for 1 other table. When we were seated at a 2-top, we asked to be moved to the 4-top next to us since it was in the shade and had a nicer view. Despite the restaurant being practically empty, she refused to allow us to move and \"preferred\" that we stay at our table. Bad service? I think so. When we left, 80% of the tables (including the one next to us) were still empty. Also beware that there were ants crawling on our table - a downside of being in a tropical location. Dining - Room Service: There is nothing bad I can say about room service. It was exceptional. They charge a $4 delivery fee plus an automatic 18% gratuity, which is pretty reasonable compared to other hotels I've been to. We ordered dinner in on a Saturday night, and it arrived within 20 minutes. The portion size was much bigger than I expected, and the quality and taste of food was superb. Every day during my trip, I went to food tastings from top caterers on the island, and none of them satisfied me like my Trump room service dinner. Front Desk: The staff at the front desk is ok - definitely not the best I've experienced. They are simply put - adequate. In my opinion, they are polite, but not genuinely friendly and always seemed so busy even when there were no guests at the desk. Although we're paying $400 a night, when I asked them to post one postcard, they asked for my room number and charged me 40 cents for the postage. 40 cents? You can't comp that?! I have never been charged at other hotels in the same class as Trump. When problems arise: On the 3rd morning of our stay, our room wasn't getting any cold or warm water. The water was SCORCHING hot even though the hot water wasn't on at all. We had an exceptionally busy day, and when we called the front desk at 6am, they said their plumber wouldn't be in until 7am but they could give us a room across the hall where we could either shower or to move to completely. The room \"across the hall\" ended up being on the other side of the BUILDING. And despite this being the hotel's problem and a potential liability, they moved us to a smaller city view room - a DOWNGRADE. We didn't have time to move all of our stuff having being delayed now 2 hours so we carried our shower supplies in our bathrobes across the building to shower. That night, the problem seemed to have been solved. However, we didn't receive any followup to say what happened, no apologies, no compensation, NOTHING - only a downgraded hotel room and a dorm room experience for $400 a night. If you are lucky enough to have a problem-free room, this is a really amazing hotel to stay in Waikiki away from all of the noise and hustle of the \"strip\".", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cnew lifestyle hotel\u201d", "Author": "RedSox311", "ReviewID": "UR115272001", "Content": "During the 3 nights that I stayed here, I had absolutely no complaints.

We opted for the former so each of the grandmas could have their own bathroom.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cLove the room, the service and the view\u201d", "Author": "eyehearttravel", "ReviewID": "UR112948360", "Content": "The service here surpassed my expectations. Despite only staying two nights, we were upgraded to a one-bedroom suite and given a bottle of bubbly to celebrate our anniversary. While this suite was on a lower floor and noisy street traffic was right below as a result, we loved the huge room and amenities. The kitchen and bathrooms were stunning, marble, granite and top of the line appliances. The design is really clean, elegant and warm. The bathroom soaps and scrubs, etc. were borderline overkill but so much fun. The bed was just heaven. The property itself is modern Hawaiian, which is a nice change from the bamboo overkill elsewhere. Service was spot on. We arrived, got water, chilled towels, unique lei's. We were jetlagged the next morning and got up at 4am. Despite room service not starting till 6, they were happy to send up breakfast for us at 5am and recommendations on the best type of tropical syrup for our pancakes. (We are novices past maple). The concierge was very helpful in arranging last minute transportation to Pearl Harbor and the airport. We didn't use but noticed really neat baskets they give beachgoers to use. They basically have thought of everything. I had a pineapple scrub and massage at the spa. It almost put me to sleep and was very much needed after our 9-hour flight the previous day. The spa is very small and does not have a locker room, which was its only drawback. This does however make you feel like you have the entire spas undivided attention.

Pros: - We booked the 4 nights and got a 5th one free through their promotions. We reserved a one bedroom studio oceanview room. We had read that sometimes guests are upgraded at check-in, but we figured with this promotion that wouldn't happen and we were quite happy with what we booked. However, upon check-in, we were very pleasantly surprised to find that they DID upgrade us to a one-bedroom suite with a den. That came with a full kitchen, giant laundry room, full bath (bathtub & shower), another bathroom with a shower, living room, and den, plus of course the master bedroom. It was seriously nicer than our house! So thanks, Trump :) - We were also greeted with champagne up at our room. Excellent touch! - Our view was beautiful. As we settled in, we caught the sunset from our suite and it was just lovely. - Bed was divine! It was hard to tear yourself away in the morning to go sight-seeing! - Bathtub was also divine. Two people fit in there quite well ;-) - Service was exceptional! Especially Dennis at the concierge. He was so helpful and patient in providing us maps and directions since our GPS in the rental car failed us. Cons: - Valet parking prices are unreal. Luckily we had read from another reviewer on here (so I shall pass it on to you!) to park literally across the street at the Hale Koa's parking lot. We got a daily rate that overall through the week saved us around $100 or more. It was even better to have our car so accessible (I mean REALLY across the street) without having to wait for valet or tip or anything. - Noise was kind of rough with traffic and buses and whatnot outside, but only if you have your lanai doors open. And really, if you want peace and quiet you probably shouldn't stay in Oahu, let alone Waikiki. So that wasn't so much of a big deal. - Friday nights for the Hilton fireworks we had hoped to grab a seat on the terrace at the bar, but that filled up pretty fast apparently so we had to settle for seats toward the back. If this is your plan, get there early and enjoy some cocktails! My husband had a delicious mai tai while I had a bellini. So all in all, I am VERY pleased we came here.

We stayed on the 23rd floor in a partial ocean view suite. I highly recommend this option! The room is modern, well furnished, huge, with a separate full kitchen, washer/dryer, living room and spacious bathroom, balcony, 2 flat screen TVs. Turn down service was thoughtful and included chocolates and AM service requests (for extra coffee, laundry detergents, etc) were met consistently and with enthusiasm. I highly recommend the suite over equivalent and cheaper traditional room alternatives in the area. Reasons: 1) you will save a lot of money by cooking occasionally and being able to keep left overs ( there is a grocery store about 15minutes from trump tower with a red box rental) 2) you will have a greatly added convenience of being able to do laundry which for daily trips to the beach, active outings will be very useful as temperature is generally 80 degrees both day and night. TIPS Check out Diamond head and do the 1 hour vigorous hike to the top. View is worth it. There is a wonderful happy hour which I recommend for drinks and appetizer. The infinity pool is beautiful but NOT great for kids as it is narrow and has sharp edges. Beach bags given by front desk include sun screen, towels, snack.

Other members of our family had a one bedroom suite with a den on the 11th floor. Upon arrival we were given beautiful leis (black tree nuts for men, white shells for women). For the Aussies reading this, to note is that if you declare the lais to Customs upon arrival, they will be confiscated. We were also given cold towels and check-in was completed quickly and efficiently. Our suite was clean and neat and we appreciated the welcoming plate of brownies and bottled water. Also supplied were sachets of premium coffee and a bag of ground coffee with a little pot of Hawaiian pineapple sugar. The air conditioning was set to arctic, so we turned it down (up?). The view from the balcony off the living room was spectacular. It was spoiled a little by the fantastic view into the rooms of the Halekulani hotel right across the road (which also blocked out most of our central ocean view) but hey, this is Waikiki and the Trump Towers is smack in the middle of one of the most built-up areas. The full kitchen was beautifully appointed and very well equipped. There was even a wine fridge. There were stools for eating at the kitchen bench but also a round glass-topped table and four chairs for meals. There was an under-bench dishwasher and a washer and dryer in a cupboard in the hall right alongside. The living area had a large flat screen TV, coffee table, writing desk, chair and comfy couches. The spaces were small but functional. The bedroom was... cosy. The drawers in the lowboy (atop which sat another flat screen TV) were ridiculously shallow and a source of frustration as things kept getting stuck and dropping down behind. The built-in wardrobe contained the floor safe (complimentary) and housed about 10 hangers. We could have done with more but didn't ask so got by without. The bed was very soft and took a while to get used to. We preferred the bed at the Sheraton Maui (where we'd just spent 4 nights). I couldn't work out how to switch off the radio (complete with iPod dock) so we just turned it down for the week. We liked the floor to ceiling windows and also the little window along the floor line which opened up for fresh air. The marble bathroom was seriously the biggest I have ever seen in any hotel (I've worked in quite a few in the past). Double sinks, full bath, full separate shower, stacks of fluffy white towels and the best shaving mirror ever. The \"Trump Spa\" branded toiletries were fantastic and included shampoo, conditioner, body wash, sugar scrub, body lotion, body cream, and shower sponge. I was so taken with the products I bought some to bring home. Goodies were replaced daily. The staff were fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble at all and everyone was polite, friendly and cheerful. We grabbed a beach bag at no charge from the concierge every day which contained towels, botlled water, fruit and sunscreen. A thoughtful touch. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants, although we did have drinks on the terrace one evening. The prices were reasonable for that standard of hotel, although the mojitos were just a little better at the Sheraton Maui. The pool was a bit of surprise. It's basically an infinity edge, two-lane lap pool with a square add-on for the jacuzzi at one end and another square add on for wading at the other end. For the size and class of hotel, the pool is lacking. That said, there's an ocean over the road so if the kids and babies splashing about become too much, best to head there. There's also a very good Spa (I'm told) but I didn't use it. Nor did we use the gym, although we had a look and it seemed adequate. A couple of cardio machines (treadmill and eliptical) and some free weights. Nothing special. The grandly-named library houses about ten books, daily newspapers and also two free internet terminals with printer. A couple of minor niggles as follows: - the plush bath robes were fantastic, but far more suited to Alaska than Hawaii. Cotton, short-sleeved robes would have been just as nice and far more functional. - the halogen lights in the low-ceiling bathroom were just too warm to stand under for any length of time. Again, more suited to Alaska than Hawaii. - the lack of a shower screen or curtain took a bit of getting used to. Water pretty much went everywhere, which wasn't ideal. - maybe because we were at the end of the corridor, but our room wasn't made up until very late in the day for most of the time we stayed. It's annoying when you want a nanna nap before dinner! - the pool was a disappointment, as were the sun loungers, which were in shade most of the day. - we still haven't worked out why it is that our party of three couples (one with a baby) were spread over three different floors. Not a big deal, but we would have liked to have been co-located. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Trump Towers but I'm dubious about going back. It's not ocean-front (although charges as if it is) and although luxurious, we didn't really need the extras such as the wine fridge etc which no doubt bumped up the cost.", "Date": "May 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellevue, Washington", "Title": "\u201cFamily Friendly Hotel in Waikiki\u201d", "Author": "1800Gabby", "ReviewID": "UR108878701", "Content": "We stayed at Trump Waikiki for a week.

Oahu was the first stop on our vacation where most of our time was spent on other islands. I chose the Trump after reading months of tripadvisor reviews on this property and its competitors. We are glad we picked this hotel and can say most of the reviews are spot on. The Trump isn't perfect, but if you want a top tier hotel in Waikiki for you and your kids, it's the best value for your money. One of the best things we discovered from reading prior reviews was to use Jet Luxury Resorts in booking this property. It saved us hundreds on two suites and they really came through for us. After arriving and finding out that one of our rooms did not have a pull out sofa as we were told it would, and as a result we were going to be short on beds for our group, a rep from Jet Luxury Resorts made the incredibly generous decision to pay for an extra room for us. My wife and I were amazed and so appreciative. That aside, here are our pros and cons on this property: Pro's: *large living areas in every unit, including kitchen (or kitchenette for the studios). To get this kind of space in any comp hotel on the strip would mean going with their biggest suites, so a huge value there. *Brand new property and everything is top of the line and spotless. You might take this for granted until you look at some of the Trump's competitors, as we did, and realize that they all look worn in comparison (some more than others). Con's: *Not right on the beach. Yes, most rooms have a nice ocean view, and yes, the beach is just a couple of minutes walk away. But for those for whom the beach is very important, the Trump's competitiors (at least the properties I compared it to and thought of choosing instead...such as the Halekulani and the Royal Hawaiian) have the big advantage here. These other properties, which we walked through and had a drink in, also have more of a Hawaiian \"feel\". The Trump could be a (great) hotel in any US city. *Pool and pool area. The other reviews you read about this are true. The Trump infinity pool is long, but ridiculously narrow. It is really just a glorified single lap pool. Worse, later in the afternoon, when the hotel's restaurant ovens turn on, the vents spew out strong smells and smoke right over the pool. Yuk! In addition, the majority of the lounge chairs around the pool are under a ceiling and completely without sun any time of day. And considering that the pool area is on the hotel's sixth floor, there's usually a bit of a breeze and it can be chilly. I think most guests and residents quickly realize this and as a result, the pool area seemed rather dead the entire time we were there. My kids and I were in the pool quite a bit, and they enjoyed it, but I'm glad it was the first hotel pool we experienced on this trip and not the last. *Concierge seemed to have it's preferred vendors best interests in mind instead of their guests. Whether it was asking the concierge desk for a quote on a car service from/to the airport or an activity (Pear Harbor), the prices they quoted me were incredibly more expensive (in some cases 2 or 3 times more) than anything I easily found myself. I don't mind paying whatever I need to for something, as long as I feel I'm getting value, but with the concierge I felt I was just being taken. If you're looking for a sophisticated, quality hotel in Honolulu, I'd probably recommend the Halekulani if you're a couple (especially honeymooners and those celebrating Anniversaries) or the Royal Hawaiian if you're with friends and lying on the beach and being in the middle of everything is most important to you. But if you're a family with kids, even with the pool drawback, I'd choose the Trump. If you know it's shortcomings going in, you won't be disappointed. I give the Trump four stars and Jet Luxury Resorts five stars.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, worth the price\u201d", "Author": "Killswitch1968", "ReviewID": "UR105837036", "Content": "The Trump is not cheap, but for good reason. I will lay out what you can expect here after staying a full 7 nights in a Beach Studio room (cheapest one I think) 1. The rooms are very clean, spacious enough to do whatever work or activity you need. They are cleaned daily with complementary bathrobes as well. 2. The complementary WiFi in every room is a bonus (I found the speeds excellent, with no troubles connecting). 3. Parking sucks. There is no doubt about it. The trump charges a whopping $28 PER DAY for their MANDATORY valet service, which means you have to tip them as well for about $30. This will probably cost you more than the rental car itself. However there is a parking lot RIGHT across the street that you can pay about $15/day for run by the Hale Koa hotel. THIS is the way to go, and no stupid valets begging for your cash. 4. There is a kitchenette with a decent size fridge, microwave, coffee maker, toaster, blender, and 2 stoves. We exploited the hell out of this. Our first day we went to Costco and picked up groceries we stocked in their fully loaded kitchen. It was great an we saved tons of money. You'll go from eating out 3 times a day to once a day, and the convenience of having a quick breakfast to start your day is great. We had daily toast, cereal, and even made some pasta, salads, and smoothies. This and combination of a Farmer's Market is all you need to have delicious, healthy, nutritious, cheap food in Waikiki. 5. The location isn't bad. It's pretty much on the Northwest corner of Waikiki, but honestly there's so much hustle and bustle there I don't think it's worth being right in the middle of the area anyway. It is NOT beach front. You have to cross a road to get to the beach, and will take about 3-4 minutes from the time you leave the hotel on foot. This also means they have nothing like beach chairs, umbrellas, or any actual property on the beach itself. If you want this stuff you have to pay the rental guys through the nose for it. The area of beach it leads to isn't pretty thin as well unless you walk a ways. All in all though the Waikiki beach isn't he best on the island by far unless you JUST want to surf. It's far too crowded and noisy if all you want to do is just lie on a towel all day. 6. People have complained about the pool. I can't say much about it since I just looked at it and left. I see no reason to go swim in a pool when there's a gigantic ocean a half block away. It is quite small. But I didn't come all the way from Canada to use some chlorinated pool so I couldn't care less. 7. One nice complementary item they offered was a beach bag you could take to the beach, This included 2 towels, 2 chilled waters, and 2 pieces of fruit (apple & orange usually). We heavily exploited this and used it pretty much everyday. 8. They do have a restaurant & spa which we completely avoided because the prices were frankly obscene. They advertised a breakfast bunch for a paltry $59 per person, and those are rum-soaked omelettes you're eating. I have no idea how good the food is but it makes sense to just stay away from it. 9.

Blt the in house steak house was great and blows away ruth chris but is just as expensive if not a bit more... lamb was to die for and the burger requires a big mouth and could just be one of the best ever, oh ya the yorkies are the speciality, unbelievable,,, keep em for breakfast and try them with jam... wow... we took a tour of a number of rooms with a great and very informative salesman jeff skinner who was a great guy, no pressure and was probablly one of the best salesman i ever met... alas jeff your product per sq ft is way ovepriced comparitivlly speaking and at the end of the day we found the traffic a little to noisy....

From our 17th floor balcony, we watched a rainbow over the ocean almost every morning, green mountains with cotton candy clouds, romantic city lights at night, and fireworks at the Waikiki Village every Friday.

Since we were there only one night, I can't comment on some of the longer term amenities. I know that you can request your favorite snack foods to be stocked in the kitchenette. This kitchenette in our studio room was right by the door - it was so clean and well-stocked with everything you would need to cook a meal that I was impressed. The complimentary teas and coffees were great too - we even took the leftovers which we never do. Welcoming us were some macaroons - yummy! The bathroom was well-appointed with a full rain shower and a deep soaking tub. The room was very spacious and was very clean. The bedroom was nicely appointed with the typical flat-screen TV and iPOD speaker/alarm system. The bed was comfortable and the great thing was that the ROOM WAS QUIET!!! The service staff were all very friendly and professional. After the nightmare of dealing with the crudy service at United Airlines, it was so refreshing to have a nice welcome from the hotel with the welcome leis made of seashells and seeds. This hotel made an otherwise horrible start to our vacation wonderful again. The location was tremendous for me! It was right off a great shopping stretch that reminded me of Rodeo Dr, plus Nobu was just 2 blocks away!!! Since it wasn't on the main drag, it was a little less busy and noisy. Although we didn't have time to check out the beach, it looked like it was just across the street from the hotel. If you have to be stranded in Honolulu for the night, shopping, dining and sleeping in style are the ways to go! The Trump definitely contributed to saving our vacation.

I was so excited because it is supposed to be the latest, greatest and best luxury hotel imaginable. It isn't. The hotel feels like something from NY or Chicago plunked down in Hawaii. If I were on vacation and looking for that special Hawaiian feel, I would have felt cheated. The lobby reminded me of the Admiral's Club lounge, not a top Hawaiian Hotel. We all had ocean view rooms and that was nice, but having to look over the tops of the hotels between us and the beach wasn't quite as nice. I knew it wasn't on the beach, but someone reading the glowing reviews and the hotels own descriptions might not get that. It is \"steps\" from the beach, but many more than the 5 or 10 that \"just steps\" conjures up and it isn't the main part of Waikiki Beach and there are scant services. The rooms themsleves were alright, clean fairly well appointed, but pretty small for the price point and I found the bathrooms small as well. The two most disapointing parts of the hotel were the pool and the \"free\" in room Wi-Fi. The pool is very small, a good part of the pool area sits under an overhang so sunning would be a challenge and then because it is on the side of the hotel, not out on an open deck, it is like a wind tunnel coming down the concrete canyon, Reading the paper was difficult it kept blowing so much. The in room Wi-Fi is some of the slowest I have ever encountered. I could get so little work done in my room I gave up and took my lap top to Starbucks to get my work completed. Part of what made it seem so much worse was that after the four nights there, my DW flew over to join me. I couldn't afford the Trump on my dime so I reserved a room at the Waikiki Parc two blocks over for four more night at over $100 less than the Trump was getting. The rooms were about the same size, the pool was much much better and we had breakfast included every day. The Parc just seemed superior in every way and the more we got comfortable there, the more my dissatisfaction with the Trump grew. Maybe if I were looking for a condo with a full kitchen I'd look more kindly on the Trump, or maybe no, because the bad pool area and design would kill any pool time for us on a vacation.

The bed was comfortable and the lanai was spacious and had a great view of the ocean. We enjoyed watching the sunrise and spotting humpback whales in the distance. The kitchenette was great for preparing light meals. We did not like the bathtub/shower. It was very poorly designed. There is a small glass partition attached to the tub instead of a shower curtain and there is no way to take a shower without getting the floor and toilet wet. I'm surprised they haven't fixed this deficiency. The complementary hi-speed internet was extremely slow when it was actually working. They have a business center (computers and printer) if you need to check in for flights and the internet isn't working in your room.

First of all, I want to mention this hotel is certainly not 5* like a Four Seasons/Peninsula/Mandarin Oriental. If you are expecting this kind of 5* treatment/amenities/polish, I suggest you go elsewhere. The Trump is solid -- just not to this other high level. First, my main complains about the hotel. 1)The bathroom. I booked the least expensive room, and the bathroom was small and poorly designed. Specifically, the shower/bath installation was designed by an incompetent. As you will see in the accompanying video, there is only a fixed piece of glass that covers at most 1/4 of the opening of the shower stall. So, when you take a shower, water spews out of the basin all over the adjacent floor and toilet. Even when I put my body as close to the wall as possible, I still could not prevent the massive water drain. Very poor design. Next, the hurdle you need to jump to get in and out of the shower is terribly annoying and painful. I am 5'9\" and had trouble; I pity the person who is shorter. 2)The Internet speed is terribly slow -- slow to the point where the connection is almost useless. Yes, the Internet is complementary (or should I more accurately say included with your room rate). The highest speed I got was 0.75Mb/sec down and 0.25Mb/sec up (and this was at 7AM). If I tried to stream a 384k clip, and I had major problems with this simple feat. Trump seriously needs to up the Internet speed per connection. 3)Value. The lowest available rate was $299/night (a promotional rate) during my stay, and I felt this hotel is not worth the money. There are other 4* hotels in Waikiki where you will get more value for your money. Lobby/Check-In: Upon arriving at the hotel, I was greeted warmly by valet and given a men's lei. The employee then took my baggage at showed me to the elevator leading to the lobby. When I arrived at the lobby, the employee was very nice and professional but clearly hurried the transaction as she was the only one manning the front desk. She was very stressed dealing with me and taking calls from other guests. Also, I noticed later in the stay that others got cold towels and a cold beverage at check-in; I did not get this (even though I looked very tired (since I just flew 11 hours). Room: I booked a standard room (around 300-350 square feet), and it was small but had the bonus of a small kitchenette. The TV was excellent in its clarity and having plenty of channels from which to choose. The bed was the best part of the room experience -- soft and cozy. The desk area was plenty adequate, and the lanai was large and offered some excellent views. Spa/Exercise: I was disappointed when I went to the spa only to discover it did not have a sauna or steam room -- just treatment rooms. The exercise facility is a separate room on the way to the spa and is open via room key 24 hours (yea!). There are plenty of modern TechnoGym machines, and the hotel was gracious enough to include cold water (with cucumber and lemon) and a cold sports drink dispenser. Pool: The pool area is small and is located on the same floor as the lobby. The pool is infinity-edge and is very small; I would hate to see this place when the hotel is fully booked. Also, there is a small hot whirlpool with the pool installation. It was nice to be able to lookout of the pool towards the ocean and adjacent neighborhood; I was just glad I was at the pool when it was not busy. Cleanliness: Excellent. Not only was the room spotless, but I saw the hotel employees cleaning the main areas of the hotel almost constantly. This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in for keeping its physical appearance up to shape. Location: Excellent. I think this is the best aspect of this hotel. You are steps away from the beach and Kalakaua Avenue (main street through Waikiki). There are many places to eat just downstairs from your room, and the area is relatively quiet since you are adjacent to Fort DeRussy. Final Thoughts: I wanted this hotel to be more on the level of a Four Seasons/ Peninsula/Mandarin Oriental and was disappointed that the polish of the former three hotels was not met. When in Waikiki next time, I will opt for one of the 4* accommodations as I feel the price point of the Trump does not get me a much higher level of service and amenities.

I am a frequent traveller and a good bed is one of the most important factors in my stay. The room and bathroom were clean with elegant marble finishings. The bathroom was quite a nice size and the shower was wonderful as it was not set in a tub but flush with the floor. Housekeeping was always prompt when we asked our room to be made up and the turn down service was at an appropriate time. I had seen the reviews on this site before I booked the trip so I knew about the issues some reviewers had with the small size of the pool. It was not a factor for us as our desire was to experience some gentility, tranquillity and luxurious comfort at the end of our long days exploring Honolulu and Oahu. This need was met. The only minor negative comment I would have is about the food in the hotel. It was not as good as I expected given the rest of the experience. It was not awful just rather lacklustre and very ordinary. Overall, we had a good stay and would stay again as long as the customer service, standard of cleanliness and room quality remain high.

From the beautiful rooms, the soft bathrobes, the comfortable bed and pillow menu, this hotel is pure elegance all the way. You feel like you are special when you stay at the Trump and it feels like a home away from home. We were impressed by the whole Trump experience from start to finish. When we arrived we were provided with a hospitality room until our room was ready. The previous guest didn\u2019t wish to leave on time so that we had to wait until after 8.00pm to finally check into our room as we had booked through Jets Luxury Resorts and you are assigned specific rooms. I disagree with the reviewer who said that the staff were unfriendly, we stayed here for almost one month and the staff greeted us every time we left the hotel and upon our return. We were very impressed that some of the staff even knew us by name. Not once did we encounter any rude staff. Any questions that we had for staff, they were only too willing to assist. I also did not encounter any problems when we asked for taxis as mentioned in one of the reviews. At all times they arrived promptly. On one occasion the valet even walked down the road to get a taxi for us. As to the remark about the horrible bottled water provided, it is complimentary bottled water that is replenished everyday and is a local product. The water tasted fine to us and it didn\u2019t have any sort of after taste at all. When it comes to the taste of water, it is a matter of personal preference and if you don\u2019t like it buy your own! The onsite Wai\u2019olu restaurant is nice and the food is tasty. They have both Japanese and Mediterranean options which is great. The signature Mai Tai\u2019s are the best Mai Tai\u2019s in Hawaii by far and we have tried a few on our trips to Hawaii so if you are staying at the Trump, you should consider trying one or two. Whilst the hotel is beautiful, it is the staff at the Trump that set this place apart from their competition. All the staff we encountered were very friendly and courteous. In particular, Todd, Sean, Dianne, Travis, Cynthia were all very nice. There were many other staff that were nice also, but their names escape me at this time. Even the cleaning staff were all friendly. I think that Trump owners should give the staff at the Trump a raise as if it were not for your staff; this hotel would be another typical hotel on the Waikiki strip. Having stayed at the Outrigger Reef last year for the same amount of time, I can honestly say that the experience at the Trump far exceeded our one from last year. It is the attention to detail and the high end feel that sets the Trump apart from the competition.

We paid less than a half of their published full rate, thus found it good value for money. The location is close to everything in Waikiki: shops, restos, beach. Being on the western edge of town, also convenient to get to Ala Moana and downtown district. The hotel faces on Saratoga Road where large vehicles circulate till late at night. I found it a bit noisy for vacation. At the back of the building (city-view), less traffic. Complimentary newspaper and high-speed internet were appreciated. Staff were not polite (as at Haleklani) nor friendly (as at Outriggers). Othereise some smile with tension. Some organizational problem ?? We booked a deluxe ocean view studio. We found our room adequate and as expected. Their web site shows it properly. Spacious enough for two of us. I liked the view from the room: from inside it is ocean view, once out on the balcony ocean and city view onto Hilton Hawaiian Village area not too close (therefore nicely lighted up at night) over Fort Derussy Park (therefore greenery during day time: scarce in Waikiki I think). We enjoyed the fireworks by Hilton (thank you fellow Tripad reviewers!), :it lasted about 5 min (only!). One morning, a complete half circle of rainbow over FD Park was heart-touching. Completely private balcony, not to see next door balconies. The room decoration is with not much of local charm, looking like a city apartment in any large cities. Loved the bedding (soft matress). The kitchenette was handy for breakfast and apero before dining out (we did not cook to dine) For grocery shopping, KCC market and Whole Foods at Kahara Mall were enjoyable. The fridge was too noisy for a studio room. The bath room was unproportionally large, with a fixed shower (which I dislike). Only one hook and one towel rack in the bathroom and no laundry rope/rack, therefore no place to hang wet bathing suits etc. The toothbrush and body sponge are made in China. Ample stock of towels held all the time. Comfy bathrobe. Trump branded bottled purified water, offered in the room, tasted quite horrible. We did not try their restaurant. One night when we thought about it, it was deserted except two tables at around 20:00. We did not try the open-air swimming pool. It was too windy to enjoy it. Staff untrained. No hospitality either. Porters and concierge seldom greet to guests. Many of them speak and behave with low morale or rude sometimes especially. This may well have discouraged us to use their services and facilities like SPA. One day we were stunned to see a porter, with a cart full of someone else\u2019s stuff, proceed to take a lift to go up, leaving us behind. He just looked at us and stepped into the lift with the cart and shut the door in front of us without a word. Concierge desk is attended only during daytime. Anyway, helpless, not experienced, with little professional knowledge. When I enquired about their \u201cbeach services\u201d one evening, no concierge was available, Front desk did not know even on which part of the beach their beach services (mentioned on their web saite) are held. A part-time worker? For details, he sent us to concierge for the following day, and she in turn told us to walk up to a desk on the beach to ask tariff etc. We lost interest and did not bother. Another day, a guest we saw at concierge desk enquired how much it would cost to get to Hanauma Bay, such a major place to visit, by taxi, and the concierge lady could not answer and started asking around. When we enquired about an event, concierge was not aware of the event and had to call us back with no result. We soon happened to walk by and it was just a couple of min. walk from Trump. Once we decided not to rely on Trump for hotel services, we enjoyed our stay all right. For activities, next door Outrigger on the Reef was helpful with hospitality and willingness, open to non-residents. We rented a car for non-consecutive days from National and Hertz at their own desks at night. We also booked a taxi transfer back to the airport, thus avoiding unpleasant contact with porter/valet desk. Overall, Trump Waikiki Beach Walk was good enough for what we paid. If understanding it as a condo with daily cleaning services and not a hotel, then no disappointment. Trump\u2019s business is that of property and not of hotel services perhaps.

The guys at the hotel lobby offered us complimentary water every time we walked in and out of the hotel and offered us even a local map as well. The suite was gorgeous. Huge windows, kitchen, flatscreens and wife loved the bathtub. Best part was the balconies outside the living room and bedroom which have amazing views of the both the ocean and of the Downtown Waikiki skyline. Location perfect. Overall, we truly felt like this was a luxury vacation from the moment we got there to the moment we left. (The way it should be when you travel all the way to Hawaii). We would highly recommend this hotel right now over all others in the area.

The cocktail and snack service at the pool was great. Nice hot tub in the middle. The Wai`olu Lounge restaurant had great cocktails and very good sushi. It's very casual and the service is great.

The food is amazing as is the service. A block away, there's Roy's, another pricey restaurant that's worth every penny. So why not a true 5 star hotel, yet? Inconsistent service and sometimes a lack of attention to details. The room service breakfast was hit or miss. The food was cold a few times and they forgot part of our order once. The staff was extremely friendly and hard working, but the concierge seemed understaffed at times. They don't anticipate your needs as does a true 5 star hotel.

The hotel is actually serviced luxury apartments; our apartment 1722 had a wonderful kitchen (full of quality kitchen items that you could not fault). A dining area that seated four and a lounge area, complete with large plasma screen, also a desk area and separate bedroom (with another large plasma screen). The bathroom was very spacious and you could enter from the hallway and the bedroom. The bathtub was extremely deep (great for soaking). Loved the open shower and the water pressure was great. Double sinks and plenty of white fluffy towels. The hotel is a year old so the rooms and furniture were still in good quality and very clean, another reason we chose this hotel over some of the other well known properties who received poor ratings on trip advisor for the quality of their room furniture etc. Upon arriving on an early flight from Australia we were given a hospitality room to utilise until our rooms were ready, and this was very much appreciated. The staff at this property is what make it an exceptional property. From Todd who worked in the bar area and who remembered our drink preferences each night and who was always up for a quick chat about our day if the bar wasn\u2019t over busy to Gemma and Dennis in Concierge who did a great job in booking our day trips and who always remembered our names. In fact everyone in the hotel always remembered your name, also special mention to Lawrence who was amazing cheerful and welcoming to us when we checked in. We chose this hotel from Trip advisor reviews and whilst we would agree with other reviews that yes the pool area is quite small and no where near as spectacular as some of the ones in the other resorts and hotels you also didn\u2019t have to have hundreds and hundreds of people and children competing for a lounge bed and also there was considerably less noise that at some of the large hotel pools (believe me we could hear it from our room balcony), so the small pool area did not bother us. The hotel prides itself on its VIP Attach\u00e9 service and we cannot fault it, in fact Marilyn Sato and Dorilyn Kato went above and beyond the call of duty in organising for my husbands specially made Adidas Golf Shoes to be ordered and sent to the hotel prior to our arrival as we were not able to do this from Australia as the company would not accept anything but an American Credit card. We especially would like to thank them for all the effort they went to and in fact we made a point of wanting to meet them and also Dean Anderson to thank them for all their assistance prior to our arrival. Overall we had a very pleasant stay and would recommend this property if you are seeking more of a luxury serviced apartment hotel stay. However, there are a couple of things that need mentioning. We were surprised that the hotel buffet breakfast did not have any cereals out (we have never come across a hotel anywhere in the world that does not have some sort of breakfast cereal in their buffet). Upon asking about cereals our waiter had not heard of Muesli but then managed to find some, however we were charged an additional $12.00 on top of the $32.00 per person for the buffet which I felt should have been advised to us not just placed on the bill, but certainly the hotel should look at including some sort of cereal in the buffet. They did of course have a large amount of Japanese food out for their Japanese visitors, but no cereal and also no pancakes. Housekeeping: No turndown service on the first night and when we asked about it we were told yes they do turndown, but for some reason missed us the first night, however, the other nights they arrived, appreciated the complimentary water each night. Also no consistency with the towels each day and night, some times we got all smaller bath towels and other nights one large one (handy for the male of this party) and then smaller ones. The rooms were cleaned to a high standard and the quality of the bath products were very good, however, on using the bath salts one night they were never replaced again so that cancelled out having another bath (I could have phoned down but to be honest when you are paying the price of the rooms that you are paying here, I shouldn\u2019t have to do this). I have to recommend the food in the bar and in particular the Black Truffle Risotto, it was so good the first night we went back for more on night two rather than go down the street for dinner, unfortunately the second night the Risotto was hard and not creamy so I had to sent it back, luckily the second time it came out perfect. I think a little more work on the food and beverage department is in order, however, we had to keep reminding ourselves that this was not a five star hotel but a luxury serviced apartment property. I also liked the fact that one of the Managers was in the breakfast area the morning we were discussing the fact that there was no cereal on the menu and we found out a day later he had written this down in his book as a follow up. John it was nice to meet you and have you listen to our observations about this. Overall this is a wonderful property but really because of their wonderful staff and with a little tweaking in housekeeper consistency and also the food and beverage department it would be an exceptional property.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cA really good hotel but it's not for everyone\u201d", "Author": "SydneyFrequentFlyer", "ReviewID": "UR90771216", "Content": "I travel to Honolulu once a year and have stayed at the Waikiki Parc, the Royal Hawaiian (pre refurb), the Hilton, the Halekalani, the Kahala and now the Trump Hotel. I rate the Trump Hotel right up there with the Halekalani and the Kahala, although it is a different type of stay. In some ways it feels more like a serviced apartment than a hotel - perhaps this is because of the rooms themselves, but I quite liked the autonomy this provided. The rooms are quite spacious and come with a kitchette and an empty minibar fridge and freezer which is a huge bonus for any traveller. I had a partial ocean view studio and it was as described. It's a new hotel so everything is nice and fresh and my balcony provided a perfect view of the Friday night firework show. The bathrooms are spacious too. The Trump Hotel's location is great - you can walk to Honolulu Zoo at one end of Waikiki or Ala Moana shopping centre at the other with relative ease. It is also a high rise which is a huge advantage - Waikiki gets extremely noisy which is why I don't like to stay at the Halekelani. Another positive is that this hotel doesn't seen to nickel and dime you like a lot of other hotels. During my stay there was bottled water replenished every evening and there was free wireless internet. The complimentary bags for the beach bags are great too. The service was okay but it wasn't fabulous. I had a couple of incidents during my week long stay ... One of the staff knocked on my door when I had the do not disturb sign on (normally not a biggy unless you are sleeping off some jet lag) ... I was getting a parcel delivered after 10pm and asked the front desk (I spoke to two people about it) to hold it for me rather than calling me on arrival. I got a call at 10.50pm. Not a biggy but annoying to get a late call when you have informed the staff otherwise ...The bellstaff were a little hit and miss - forgot to call me a taxi on one occasion - and a couple of other incidents that doesn't give it five stars - for service, I believe the Kahala is better. Restaurant service wasn't great either. Having said that Housekeeping was great - both the morning and turndown service was exemplorary - they serviced your room as if you were walking into the room for the first time. Two things that really let this hotel down are; 1) the entrance - it feels like you are entering through a carpark and not very welcoming and 2) the pool - as others have noted, is impossibly small and not the type of pool you want to lay around. But these are design flaws - nothing that can be 'fixed' as such. My recommendation? If you are on a budget, stay at the Waikiki Parc - if you are on your honeymoon stay in an ocean view room at the Halekelani - if you are celebrating your wedding anniversary stay at the Kahala - and if you have kids stay the Hilton.

The amenities in there were well thought out - even offering a dental kit (toothbrush, toothpaste, floss).

The library of the hotel was nice and quiet with a great selection of reading material, and the 24 hour fitness center had state of the art equipment.

The room was pure luxury with amazing views of the water and beach. The bed was like lying down on a cloud - amazing comfort!! The hotel continued to impress with the concierge having fully equipped beach bags for guests use. They included beach towels, chilled water, fruit and the option of sun cream. Again, everything was thought of! Dinner at the restaurant was excellent. It was a Friday night, so there was even amazing views of fireworks from our table! (There are fireworks every Friday night, so try to book a table with a view!) At the end of the meal the hotel once again sent over a Happy Birthday desert. A very sweet ending! The hotel itself is very well placed. The beach is right across the street and took about 1 minute to get there.

They even offer the Wii. Amazing. My kids kept screaming to go back because they felt so special. To top it all off, since they knew that one of our kids had a birthday, they send room service up with special treats for them but not just for one of them, they made sure to include something else for the other child so they don't feel left out-not that is so thoughtful.

Lots of towels and bath products were available every day, since the maids clean the room in the morning/early afternoon, and refresh the towels at night. The pool is a lap pool, and has a nice view of the ocean and city. It is small, but very nice. Depending on where you sit by the pool, you can choose whether or not you want to get sun. There is poolside service, with a varied menu available for those that want to eat a snack or meal by the pool. The configuration of the hotel is interesting. The concierge and valets are on the ground floor, and the lobby/reception is on a different floor. The layout in the hotel is so great, that only about 20% of the time we encountered someone in the elevator. Even though the hotel was booked to capacity, they have the \u201cpeople flow\u201d well thought out. It prevents a lot of people being crowded in one area. Hotel Outside: We were about a three minute walk to the beach. It was a very easy walk, with a crosswalk. It is near the army museum. The beach there is one of the most uncrowded stretches of beach in the area. You can either set up a towel on the green grass in the park, which is roughly between the park and the hotel, or you can choose to set up on the beach. The park is pretty. There are a few food vendors directly off the beach, and a few hotels within a short walk for additional snacks/meals. If you go out snorkeling- There are a few patches of large rocks that have colorful fish. There is also a patch that is shallower, and has lots of sea urchins. I saw a huge sea turtle on the last day there. We drove to a well-known snorkeling beach for the day, and frankly I saw just as much in the ocean in front of the hotel. When you stay at the Trump, consider stocking up on all your beach needs, such as umbrellas, snorkeling supplies, etc. at a local drug or convenience store, because it is all very expensive to rent on the beach. Service: The service is my favorite part of the hotel. In general, I would say that the people in Hawaii are the nicest in the world. The Trump must have employed the nicest people in the state. My personal favorite person was Kawai, the Concierge. The few times we had problems or questions, she led us in the right direction. The valet staff and bellman were always so friendly and nice, and treated us professionally and warmly. We thought they were so nice, that we brought them pastries when we returned from our trip to the bakery. All the staff made us feel very, very special. The room was always cleaned quite well. The staff at the Trump is very on top of any problems. One day my husband and I were surprised to see a 3 year old Japanese boy in the elevator by himself when we got in on the 9th floor. We took him to the front desk. Within one minute, the front desk clerk found a staff member who spoke Japanese to the boy, and calmed him down within seconds. About two minutes after that, a big, handsome man who was head of security showed up. Then, the mother wandered into the lobby a few minutes after. The staff are trained professionals, who could probably have the capability of running a small company within a few days! I look forward to staying at other Trump hotels when I visit other cities.

Trump Waikiki on Oahu, Hawaii was beyond expectation. A nice addition of Luxury in almost the heart of Waikiki, the Trump Waikiki is maintaining the Trump tradition of service, pampering, food and beyond. The Residences at Trump start at the Studio level to over the top 3 bedroom 2 story dream suites. I tried out \"Trump\" a few different ways on my stay there in February. I had to discover what it was like to sip champagne while soaking in the deep bathtub, with an oceanview, from my 1 bedroom suite :) And then I heard that little \"room service\" voice in my head, refusing to leave me alone until I called and ordered Eggs Benedict and fresh OJ. It's my preferred resort room service breakfast. Often times, when traveling with my best girlfriend Sue, we'll combine the champagne and eggs benedict for breakfast. Since I was traveling Solo and working hard to inspect all aspects of Trump Waikiki, I separated the two experiences. Well, it's difficult to drink champagne while soaking in the bathtub (with an oceanview) and eat eggs benedict!!! Speaking of bathtubs, I love the bathrooms at Trump. Groovy showers, deep tubs (only some units have ocean views from the bathtub), simple but elegant. And, as a bathrobe connoisseur, I believe that Trump Waikiki has TRUMPED all others in Hawaii. Just so you have some insight about my bathrobe \"interests\", after the bellman has brought my things to the room, I head straight for the bathroom to see if the bathrobe is snugly, soft, luxurious..... so I know if I have something to look forward to later in the day. I do have one other hotel on Oahu whose's bathrobe might be tied for best. Maybe! At home, I usually wear \"logo\" bathrobes I have bought at places like Cousteau Fiji, Yasawa Island Resort and Qamea. But when I visit the resorts in Hawaii, I love the snuggle factor, soft to the touch, and good fit to enjoy while lounging in my air conditioned hotel room. The beds are like sleeping on a cloud, delicious sheets and sweet dreams. The Spa services are unique and pampering. I enjoyed a facial which included placing a multitude of lights over my face (I now look 10 years younger :). Lacking a locker room, they give you extra time to bubble in the jacuzzi overlooking Waikiki. Complete thumbs up on this small but classy Spa! The gourmet kitchen (all units have them) sparkled in my eyes with granite counters, Subzero refrigerators (all except the studios) and fantastic gidgets, gadgets and useful items that I might only dream of having in my kitchen at home. Although I only know how to cook a Caesar salad, when I dream about having a gourmet kitchen I also dream that I can cook! :) There are so many things to talk about, but I'll leave you with 2 very important bits of information. The food at Wai'Olu oceanview bar was fun and frisky (mouthwatering) and the drink menu dazzled my libation gene. I have committed to return on a Friday night, to sample more Liquid Creations at Wai'Olu and watch the Friday Waikiki Fireworks. Last but not least, is how close the beach is to the Trump Waikiki. It's always a question in my mind since I am a sun goddess and I know that many of the clients of McCoy Travel come to Hawaii to enjoy the beach/sun. Trump provides you with a beach bag, towels and water and then you take a 5 minute walk to the beach where the \"beach concession\" has lounges/umbrellas for rent at a very very reasonable price. Waikiki Beach is NOT a quiet beach, it's very much about people watching, including surfers, stand up board surfers, hawaiian outrigger canoes, sailing catamarans and more. The ocean is 20 shades of blue, delightful to take a swim in. Fondest Alohas.....

Housekeeping was a bit scattered (no spare toilet paper-- had to ask on the 2nd day for more); one day a fluffy bath mat appeared, but never reappeared after that; on the 3rd day a makeup mirror appeared(?); newspapers left in the room for days; kitchen garbage not taken out. Also, there was no waiter service at the pool and we had to ask that the dirty towels and tables be cleaned up as they were a bit sticky after people had left. No one ever came around to ask if we wanted a drink at the pool, which I'd expect at a luxury hotel at least every hour on the hour. To access the infinity pool (which is not very large) you have to go through the main lobby (no side elevators). Also, there are two elevated grates in the bottom of the pool near the far wall which are dangerous (I caught my foot in one and my toe is still hurting a week later). Something should be put there to warn of them as a child could get caught easily in them. A nice touch is the beach bag which the hotel loans you with towels, water and a fruit snack; we were told we had to return the bag each day but I did notice someone checking out carrying one. Also the beach chair rental program is a bit confused; the hotel said the chairs could be rented and charged to your room but the man on the beach said he didn't have any arrangement for payment from the hotel. I noticed the shell leis at the valet desk and only when I asked I was I told \"you should have gotten one at check-in\" (we didn't). On checkout we wanted help with the luggage, but the valet did not answer the phone and we had to carry the luggage downstairs ourselves to find several staff at the valet desk--not acceptable. I don't want to sound nit-picky here, but if you are a luxury property, all these little things should happen or not happen (depending) without the guest having to ask for them. Simply having high end finishes and countertops doesn't make a luxury hotel, the total experience does. Hopefully in time, the hotel will learn what guests of a luxury property expect and then it will be a great place to stay.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Austrlia", "Title": "\u201cFeel like a VIP for a day....\u201d", "Author": "CandJtravles", "ReviewID": "UR49932334", "Content": "My partner and I checked into this sleek lap of luxury hotel on their opening day! A swam of valet attendants were on hand and effortlessly guided us up to the 4th level for check-in. With beautiful shells around our neck from the greeting at the valet and all the attention we could hardly contain ourselves. At reception you're given cool towels and a welcome beverage as your accomodations are sorted. Having been the first day our room wasn't ready so we decided to dash out for a wonder around Waikiki to enjoy the beautiful morning. I must note we did arrive at the hotel at 9:30am so we really didn't expect the room to be totally ready. Once in the room we felt like we'd arrived in an environment in which we could truely live for the rest of our lives! Our accomodation was a studio which had a kitchenette with a cooktop, microwave, fridge, sink, etc... A roomy bathroom with an open planned shower (no doors) and a soaking tub. Our balcony looked out onto the park and ocean in front. There was ample space to enjoy. The infinity edge pool is outside on the same level as the lobby which offers stunning views of the park and city alike. Since the Grand opening isn't until the beginning of the year, all of the restaurants weren't opened at the time. They still had a few things to iron out, but that can be expected on a soft opening. We had a problem with our aircon and the service guys were up to the room before I could sit down! Later, they even sent up a bottle of champagne to the room. We were only there for one night after arriving from Maui and en route back to Australia, but our time at the Trump Hotel in Waikiki was very memorable! We will be returning to this hotel next year for a much longer stay so we can enjoy more of the superior service that this hotel provides!
