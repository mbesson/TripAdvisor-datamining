Stayed here for 3 days with my wife in March and its fine for budget travellers although even then I'd look around as its not particularly cheap! Good things about this hotel are its location, 5-10 mins walk to Fisherman's Wharf, Lombard Street right around the corner and its on busy street which is well served by the local buses. The rooms are dated but clean. Bad things, it doesn't look particularly nice. Being a motel its on a busy street so you can hear a lot of noise from the street especially when trucks come through or people playing loud music! Walls are paper thin which meant 1 night we had to listen to the 3 girls next door dissecting their club night at 3am...we could hear their whole conversation clearly. They say breakfast is included but its a joke, a some coffee and stale croissants if you fancy it! All in all fine if you are single travellers on a budget and other budget hotels are not available. Personally we won't be back, Cathedral Hotel down the road costs a bit more but much nicer and seeing as we got a bus pass its easy to get around so there's not so much benefit being so close if you have to stay in a place like this!", "Date": "Apr 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR454338898", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "dripsy"}, {"Content": "Pas le meilleur souvenir de Frisco   showReview(19647159, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR970895873", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "L'albergo non si trova in...   showReview(19997921, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR794954744", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "bonne \u8305valuation qualit\u8305-prix   showReview(19647158, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR915298316", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Ho trovato molto sporca la...   showReview(17172352, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR780615367", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Bon h\u4e48tel   showReview(16611844, 'full');", "Date": "May 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR179421223", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d256730-r19991098-Country_Hearth_Inn_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html", "HotelID": "256730", "Price": "$108"}}
