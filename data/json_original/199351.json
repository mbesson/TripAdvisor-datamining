The rooms were clean, the location was convenient to the train station and the desk staff were helpful. We did not try the breakfast as it seemed a bit pricey and the internet access in the lobby, while convenient was not friendly to the user. We originally had booked at a Best Western sister hotel near the other side of the train station. They bumped us for a tour group, but did pay the cab fare and for any difference in room rates. A bit inconvenient, but not a great hardship as this was a slightly better location.

Stayed here in July 2004. The hotel is close to the red light district of Frankfurt, by the main railway station. Although this is limited to two or three streets, this may be an eye opening experience for some as in one street the local drug addicts flopped out! As for the hotel, I had a single room. It was clean and tidy. Minor quibble was the drooping shower head in the bathroom. As for breakfast buffet, this seemed to vary each morning in terms of quantity and items offered. Reasonably priced for the standard of accommodation provided.", "Date": "Feb 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR274680508", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "TimASurrey."}, {"Content": "Good value in central station area. I've been staying here for many years, because of its handy location and the reasonable rates during trade fairs. I've tried many of the hotels in the central station area and this is probably the best mid-price one. It's really a business hotel and I wouldn't take my family there; you can do much better out of fair time. The rooms vary in size and the single ones can be small and cell-like.

We were flying out of Frankfurt the next morning so I booked us into what I felt would be a quiet, clean, safe Best Western hotel. I had made reservations well in advance and asked for two triple rooms. This request was confirmed but when we arrived only one triple room and one double were available, so they put my son in a single room (at no charge), his wife and son in the double and my husband, myself and our granddaughter in the triple room two floors away from the rest of our family. But this was a minor problem.This hotel is in a questionable location with girlie shows, men's clubs etc. surrounding it. When we asked the desk clerk where we could eat dinner that was close to the hotel, we were told there wasn't any place safe or suitable to take a family in that area. We ended up driving several miles before we found a place. Parking in the evening in Frankfurt is difficult at best and parking for the hotel is a block away. There was constuction going on next door to the hotel and this construction went on all night, making sleep almost impossible.The only plus to our experience was the breakfast served. The hotel puts on a great German style breakfast.Would I stay in this hotel again...NEVER.", "Date": "Jul 11, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR799992437", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Marykh"}, {"Content": "\u6910\u5470\u7e4e\u9287\u0442\u7a76\u9352?#x201d;
