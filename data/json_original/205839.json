To the hotels credit we were offered a heater over-night and more blankets. The heating was fixed later the next day. Our room was okay - quite small but fairly clean however the bathroom is very tired and the shower cubicle is tiny and the curtain sticks to you making showering a far from pleasant experience. Oh and water gets everywhere, so much so that we had to resort to using towels on the floor as make shift mats. Water temperature in the bathroom never really got above luke warm. I would also expect more in the way of luxuries for a 4 star hotel, e.g shower gels etc. Breakfast contained a good selection as previously mentioned however they are very slow at keeping food, cutlery, milk etc etc available and the tables cleared.

It had 4 metre high ceilings with ornate covings, ceiling rose and chandalier. The walls were entirley decorated with luxury fabric and the floors were marbled tile. The furniture was reproduction antique. The large bed was very comfortable. It resembled a bedroom in a grand house and in a very good way it was like sleeping in a piece of Italian history. So much nicer than all those chain hotels were every room is exactly the same. The shower room was a little small and could have done with updating \u2013 although everything was clean and worked perfectly. The public rooms again were very ornate with lots of marble and gilt mirrors. The staff were friendly. There was a great food selection at the buffet breakfast \u2013 the best I have had in a European hotel. Fantastic cakes and coffee - they even had bacon and scrambled eggs. The hotel is well located \u2013 only 15 mins walk from the train/bus station. The bus stop outside and takes you to locations all over Rome for only 1 euro. There are several various types of restaurants/pizzerias in the immediate vicinity. We found the Rossopomodoro pizzeria close by which was very good. On our last stay in Rome we stayed at another hotel and paid more than twice the price for it. The Turner Hotel was much nicer and we have had a wonderful Italian experience.

I'd like to write this two words to let you know my experience in Rome. I came back in Rome after 20 yrs and got a 15day holiday there. Let's start: I wrote several emails, just to check my details and avoid problems during my stay. I phoned and write email to check my booking and there was a gentle guy answering me the phone and giving me my sureness I'll have a nice experience, he organised me everything and I apreciated their Transfers & Tours Services (organised at the reception). When I arrive the same guy of the phone Welcome us, saying (for the first time in a hotel) my name: \"Welcome, Mr. Paul\" which I really appreciated. Easy and good managed check-in. The Smiley guy - bell boy escorted me to my room and shown us everything we wanted to know. The room was incredible stylish and ready to relax us. Big marble bathroom, a good bed and a lot of space. Went to the reception and got the free wifi (saved us a lot of time) and loved this free service. The lobby was perfect for a time dedicated to a newspaper of watching television with the nice old man, everyday staying there, probably was the owner. Days by days, good breakfast. I never tried the Room Service there, but I know people got to the reception and saying it was ok. The guy at the reception, Catalin, was so useful and so kind with us all the time. He organised us a sort of \"day-live-something-to-do\" and appreciated his help suggesting good restaurants, good tours, good info about the city and of course the speech about more or less. He's prepared and get to succeed. He was charming with everyone, smiling all the time and full of positive energy. Our 15 days flew away and the last night went to check out our bill there. Guess who was on a service? The charming guy! He let us know everything and he wished me a nice last night in Rome. The day after a Black Mercedes got us to the airport (transfer service) and completed my half-month holiday... HAPPY! A good satifaction and a good hotel, full of Human Power. Thanks to the staff, Catalin and the others, we had a very good time! Hotel should invest more on people there, people like the reception guys! WE DO SUGGEST THIS HOTEL. CHOOSE IT AND RELAX! ...

We extremely impressed by the rooms and hotel which had an old Italian look with amazing antique furniture in the room and beautiful statutes in lobby. The breakfast was simple but tasty, however was not staffed well. There was constantly empty plates at the buffet (which isn't big so that doesn't leave much food!). The rooms were beautiful and the bathroom was quite big for Italy. The location was great as even though it's about a ten minute drive to all the amazing sights of Rome, there is a bus just outside the hotel that goes to all the main sights bar the Colloseum. Bus 62. Our issue here was the reception staff - and not all, as our last night there was the most charming and friendly gentleman working reception. Although all other receptionists we encountered were extremely cold and short. The one that checked us in was VERY rude and practically threw the key on the reception desk and said the porter will show you your room. We were never told anything, no intro, nothing. We had to ask the porter what time/floor breakfast was in, how to get around, whereabouts the hotel is on a Rome map. So we didn't have a great welcome. And then our jacuzzi in the room wasn't working but the receptionist didn't seem to care as we rung to get someone to look at it and it took three phone calls and over an hour and a half of waiting before anyone came up. They said it was broken and a technician had to look at it. They said check with them in the morning. We did and the same receptionist was on, he laughed and said, it's broken there is nothing we can do. I then wanted a discount on our stay because we booked a superior room - he said there was no way as we booked not directly through the hotel but said to check back the next day. We did and he shrugged us off.

There are a number of trattorias just two streets parallel to the hotel which are very reasonably priced. We went to Trattoria pizza napoli and it was very good value. For 12 Euro we had bruschetta, pasta and a soft drink. Drinks here were cheaper ( Euro 3) than central rome where a soft drink is 5 euro. There were a number of other restaurants which looked very appealing. We took 3 rooms for our stay. A suite and 2 deluxe rooms. Room 532 (double superior) was the best. The furniture in all three rooms is exquisite (antique furniture / damask curtains / chandeliers etc) marble floors etc. The bathroom is on the small side and has a shower with an incorporating jacuzzi. Room 530 is just as nice but slightly smaller than room 532. The staff was great and they also gave us a complimentary champagne in the room given that our brother had his 40th birthday. Breakfast is good and includes cereals, salamis, cheese, scrambled eggs bacon, yogourt and a vast choice of pastries and cakes. The decor of the hotel is extremely nice. The hotel website offers some great offers so best to check this before you book through another site. For 3 nights we only paid 250 euro for a double superior room. Staff was very willing to help with information and was extremely curteous. Arianna was great. The hotel also has a rooftop bar which is open till midnight and even later - which is perfect for a night drink. The only negative apect of this stay was in respect of the junior suite - room 506 which had a faulty airconditioner and it was a nightmare to sleep at night because during the night it seems that the airconditioners are turned lower.

It was pretty much all you needed to start your day off. Rome itself: Rome is a very beautiful city and I would highly reccomend seeing it.

On arriving at the hotel we were shown to our room which looked \"cosy\" at the least. A query at reception assured me I was in a junior suite, I thought this looked strange but put it down to the rooms always look bigger in the pictures. After 1 night of shuffling around the bed, I looked at the hotel's website to find if we did indeed have the right room. The suite on the website did look spacious to say the least and I checked my booking to make sure I had booked the right room, which I had. Imagine my surprise when I checked to see what a regular room looks like and was greeted with pictures of my very own room, with the same detailed green wallpaper and oriental wardrobe. I immediately showed the pictures to the manager on duty that had given us our room. He first informed me that the pictures were of a standard room. When I told him that the pictures were of my room and that I had actually booked a suite, he said that I actually did have a suite and the pictures were wrong on the internet and needed updating. He then proceeded to explain that the hotel was being refurbished and my room had not been done yet, I failed to see how a decoration would make the room bigger. He said I would have to speak to the hotel manager who would not be in the next day. The kick in the teeth came the next morning when on the way to breakfast I walked past another room that was vacant , but the door left open to air the room. I \"peeked\" in to find a room to the proportions I thought I had booked. I immediately grabbed my camera and took photos of the empty room and my room. I showed the photos to the same manager who said I was in the right room and that I would have to speak to the hotel manager who was in the next day. At this point I did not know if I was losing my mind or if this was some sort of scam thought up by the Sopranos! I went on the website and took photos of the pages that described the rooms (even square metres), along with these I took the pictures of the 2 rooms and my booking voucher to a second manager. I explained I would be taping the conversation on my phone and showed all the evidence for the prosecution. After 10 Mins the manager said I was in the wrong room. Hooray! Their first solution was to move me to a suite, not that night, but the following night. This was our last night and I was not about to move all of our baggage for 1 night. They also did not mention anything about the money I had paid for a suite but only received a standard room. I refused to move until this was sorted. The mysterious hotel manager was phoned. He would refund the difference of the 2 rooms and no more. I only think he did this after Last Minute.com was mentioned. If I had booked directly I think he would have told me to take a walk. I eventually received some money back. My thought was that if I had said nothing, this would have gone unnoticed. I am not sure whether they did it on purpose, but they tried to disguise the fact for 3 days. On the final day, I saw the manager who had booked us in and given our room. He was still unapolagetic and said there was a problem with the computer (along with the internet pictures and undecorated room).

When we went to breakfast on our first morning we were asked if we wanted to upgrade to the other dining room for 5 euros, as I said before we were on a budget so we decided to stay put, Good thing we did as de soon found out you can have food from both dining rooms, paying extra just meant that you sat in a brighter room. On the plus side the hotel is not in the centre so restaurant prices are cheaper and there are quite a few around the hotel, also there is a bus stop right outside the hotel which makes getting to the sites really easy. On leaving the hotel we didn't even get a goodbye. So thank you Turner Hotel for spoiling my husbands birthday. Would we stary there again, not a chance, would we recommend this hotel, not a chance. Take our advice if you are on a budget do not stay in this hotel you will get a nicer 3 star for what we paid for this break.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "west mids", "Title": "\u201cNot worth its 4 stars - disappointing\u201d", "Author": "jandkWestMids", "ReviewID": "UR106260447", "Content": "After seeing the pictures on the hotels website, we believed that we were staying in a very opulent hotel and very much looking forward to staying there.

I always judge a hotel on its bathroom!! and in this hotel it was not good. It was clean enough but the shower was a tiny little square up the corner with a shower curtain that had cable ties for curtain rings and due to the smallness of the shower the curtain attacked you as you showered!! On a more positive note, the location was fab, there is a bus stop outside the hotel where you can get buses to most of the major attractions in Rome and the breakfast was good.

When we checked in we were given a standard double room which was quite dissapointing for a 4 star hotel. It was dark and dingy and very small. Once inside the bathroom it was clear that my husband (who is of average build but quite tall) could barely fit inside the shower. With no bath, and therefore no alternative for washing this was clearly a problem. I went to the reception desk to ask if they had a different room and I was met with lots of sighing and frankly lots of barriers. My husband came out ot see if I was OK as this had been going on for some time. In the end the receptionist offered us a more superior room but wanted to charge us an extra 20 Euros per night. Obviously we were quite taken aback by that so she offered it at 15 Euros per night. Now, I understand that the hotel has rooms of various standards but surely even the most basic of rooms need to be fit for use. She tried to tell me that all showers in Italy were that size which we know from experience is a complete lie. After much huffing and puffing and throwing of hands in the air (on her part not ours!) she gave us this room free of charge which turned out to be a comfortable stay. However it put me ill at ease for the beginning of our stay there. The hotel is situated quite a way out of the city which proved to be a bit of a pain when getting around. Breakfast seemed ot be divided into Continental and Full. When we booked through an agent we just had the option of bed and breakfast but were quite surprised to find that we only had the continental which consisted of juice, cereals and pasteries (quite limited) Also, be warned...Rome has added a tax on overnight accommodation in the city which is not included if you book through an outside website.

Pros: - The breakfast is excellent and a great start to each day. Cold meats/cheese/pastries etc are on offer. - Free, fast wifi - Rooms were cleaned very well every day - Hotel itself is grand in a quirky way - I liked the styling. Some may call it outdated but I think it's a matter of preference. - They've just opened up a bar - the bar area is nice, as are the bar staff - Staff were helpful in booking excursions/taxis. Some tourists may take their stiffness to be rudeness but I don't think this is the case. Don't expect smiles and all the other 'bells and whistles' but the staff are always willing to help when asked. Cons - No room service - bit of a shame when you're feeling hungry in the middle of the night - The rooms are quite small, to the extent that I questioned the concierge as to whether I had been given the superior double I had booked. Expect to feel squashed in the shower unless you are very petite. - The roof terrace has great potential but needs to be updated with some new furniture. Currently it is fitted with plastic deck chairs etc. It offers a great view of the sunrise and would also be a nice place to relax in the evening, so would be good if they fitted it out. - We took minicabs everywhere so location wasn't that much of an issue. We could get pretty much anywhere for 10EUR. But if you like to walk to all the large attractions, you may prefer somewhere more central.

All staff were friendly and provided help on the local areas when required, special thanks to the guys who served breakfast, they were always friendly and happy to help if we had questions. The other massive plus point for us was the hotels location. Its a very short journey from the main sights via a bus but is just far enough away from the central tourest area that you will not get ripped off for food at its local resturants and bars that tend to be better quality and get Italian customers. For exmaple: near the hotel my girlfriend and my self had drinks, a main and desert each which in total cost 36 euros. On our last day we decided to have lunch bang in the center of town and was charged 10 euros for each glass of coke (i know, carzy !) and silly money for a very small snack, total 60 euros. I will be returning to Rome and will be returning to the Turner.

It looked and felt dirty, old and dusty. The wallpaper was grey rather than cream as it was dirty and the bed covers were covered in stains. The bathroom was very old too. It seemed nothing at all like the hotel we had looked at pictures of and read reviews for. After complaining, we were moved to the otherside of the building to floor 5. After stepping out of the lift we were suprised that it was completely different, new, wooden floors. It was as if we were in a new hotel all together! The room was a lot nicer with a completely different bathroom, furiture, etc- just like we had seen in the photos. Considering there was no option when booking to choose from the new or old part, make sure you are not fobbed of with the smelly dirty old rooms. Our stay ended up being very nice. Bus stop just outside 10 mins into the very centre of rome ( trevi fountain, spanish steps, collosseum) staff not overly helpful but to be honest not many of the italians were at all- everyone just desperate for a tip! Also beware alot of the restaurants in rome have small print- * some food with asterix may be frozen. Frozen pizzas!! We were suprised to find this in the home of the pizza italy, worth paying a little extra for nicer restaurants. Another tip, when at the colloseum there is a huge huge que.

The bus waited for us at Fiumicino Leonardo da Vinci airport, and then took us to Hotel Turner. We had a room at the last floor, the 6th. It seemed new, completely renovated. The room was quite big, decorated in an antic mode, my wife loved it... she said that she fel very aristocratic. We met the owner of the hotel. Mr Longo, he said to call him Tony, planned a very rich itinerary for us: the bus and the guide was at our disposal from 08 to midnight. We saw at least 15 churches, the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish steps etc, but the most important thing was the Vatican City and a private visit with The Pope (they booked this visit 8 months before for us). It was incredible! As you know us Greeks, are orthodox, we are not subject to the Vatican, but meeting the Pope was a beautiful experience for all of us. The hotel has a Internet WiFI FREE connection in the lobby and the rooms. It was very fast, we stayed in touch with our friends back home with Skype, for free. One of our friends had a laptop problem, and the hotel computer guy they called fix his computer in less than 2 hours. I do not know how much it costed but my friend was very happy afterwards, so I don't think it was much. Breakfast was quite rich, it had everything... I recommend to try the italian breakfast way: cappuccino and corneto. I think the position of the hotel is central, but most of the time we used the bus they provided with the guide. The metro is near the hotel. We used it a couple of times to go to Piazza Barberini and Piazza di sPagna. It was one of the best trips our church ever organized, and lots of compliments go to Hotel Turner and their organization. Our group was very pleased with this hotel's services.

The building is undeniably beautiful on the inside. The outside is covered in scaffolding however which we were not made aware of when we booked. The first room we were given was furnished beautifully and on the surface looked fine however when we went to put our belongings in the wardrobe it reeked of sick. The bathroom was peach and brown and very dated and a huge black mould patch was on one walls. On closer inspection of the room, the wallpaper was beginning to peel off with damp. We asked to move rooms to a less damp one and got a free upgrade. This was less worse but it still had a bad mould problem. The room had beautiful high ceilings, impressive wall coverings and furniture and the bathroom was spacious. However it was very, very dirty and the bedding rather disgusting as it was stained and smelled of sweat and perfume. It was also freezing cold and the \u2018heater\u2019 control in the room was hanging off. Our windows didn\u2019t close properly so it was very noisy from the busy main road outside the hotel. It was even more noisy on the weekdays because the builders on the aforementioned scaffolding begin work at 8am and make a huge racket. They worked literally outside of our window too so there was little privacy. The most hideous thing about this room however was the bathroom \u2013 we were upgraded to the room with the Jacuzzi. Be warned before you book that this is a shower cubicle which looks like it was created in 1990 (the once white colour is now beige and brown, control buttons worn and black mould on much of the plastic which spouts water). The steam system inside of this disgusting cubicle did not work and the \u2018jacuzzi\u2019 part is merely the name of the brand. Do not pay for the upgrade for this. Also the hairdryer is a bizarre contraption which works as effectively as having your partner blow on your hair so I would advise you to take your own ladies. However the sockets in this place were horrendous and despite being on a holiday where we stayed in four different EU cities and so had used my plugs and electronic equipment in other hotels on my trip, I couldn\u2019t get anything to work in the room as all the sockets were loose. The wardrobe in this room also stunk so we couldn\u2019t actually unpack anything. The location of this hotel was OK with about a 7 minute walk to the metro station \u2013 but we are young fit and healthy so if you have any type of disability, are elderly or have a pushchair you may wish to rethink booking at this location. To get to the station you have to cross over many very busy roads, up and down curbs and down lots of steps. We didn\u2019t eat at the hotel (the hygiene of the rooms was enough to put us off) so we can\u2019t comment on the food. I\u2019m afraid to say I would stay in this hotel again if I was paid to. We got it for an absolute bargain price of \u00a358 per night \u2013 as it should have been in the hundreds. I felt robbed of that tiny amount so I definitely would not pay vast amounts to stay here.", "Date": "March 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWhat a disappointment\u201d", "Author": "TravelQueeny", "ReviewID": "UR14244070", "Content": "After looking at the photos on the website and taking into account Hotel Turner was supposed to be a 4 star hotel, I was shocked at what I ended up with.

In fact the whole of the front of the hotel was covered in scaffolding to the point that you could only just make out whether it was night of day through the think green net which covered each of the windows. Upon arrival in Reception I was greeted by a sour faced man who to my surprise did at least let us check in earlier than normal but that was short lived. After taking a trip in the Tower of terror lift and making in to the 4th floor we walked straight into our room which was still being cleaned, and were forced to walk back along the dirty, shabby corridor and take the dreaded lift back down again. Is there somewhere we can get a coffee? Or a bar we can wait in until the room is ready? NO was my answer 'walk to the top of the road'. Later that day when we returned to the room and were able to properly take in our surroundings it took all my energy not to turn around and walk straight out again. I enjoy camping, I am not a princess but I honestly couldn't bring myself to put my feet on the carpet for fear of what lived in it.

It had a jacuzzi bath, which we did use but only after giving it a clean ourselves as it didnt look \"spotless\" which is what I would have liked. The location was OK, with convenient buses passing into the historical centre every 5-15 minutes but we are young and dont mind cramming onto the public transport, whereas I would imagine for a family with young children or older guests it may not be as suitable. Breakfast was OK, nothing special but no complaints and the restaurant and reception staff were on the whole helpful and pleasant. I probably wouldnt return to this hotel again because for the amount paid for the room I would expect a bit more for the money.

While this may be used a single room there is NO excuse to have a bidet IN a shower! The other rooms, 202 and 220 were ok, but only ok. Two safes in 202, one of which worked, the safe in 220 didnt work at all. Tiny showers, although we felt that it was a bonus for the water to be hot! The furniture just looks old, worn and tacky, not in any way glam. like the marbled reception area. The v. small lounge looks, and feels like a funeral directors waiting area. The place just didnt feel cosy or welcoming. The breakfast room was fine and the choice was simply excellent. The service there was good too, though you have to speak up or you may miss out on your coffee. The smell of burning was strong as we exited the v. small lift on our first day. I reported this to reception and was met with ..... a shrug of the shoulders from the mature male on duty. (NO eye contact from him). I insisted that the problem be solved as it was a fire risk, (a faulty light tube), and only when I insisted was the job attended to. Check out was a total drama with a computer crash and the phone lines being down! One female staff on duty at 7.30 am! Very stressed and very unprofessional. When I asked her to order a taxi she said NO! So, I reached her MY mobile phone...... the look on her face was priceless..... then she indicated that she didnt know how to dial the taxi company number!

This hotel is excellent as a 3.5 stars hotel but there are many things in this hotel that has to be improved in order to achieve 4 stars quality. The hotel is located at Porta Pia, about 800metres from Termini Central Station and 50 metres from the British Embassy in Italy. One can get to this hotel by taking bus number 90 from Termini (get off at second stop) or bus number 56 also from Termini (get off at fifth stop). The view of the hotel entrance from outside was very nice. We arrived at the hotel at about 7 pm and the check-in process took about 5 minutes and we were given the key to our room straight away. The porter had helped us carrying our bag to our room. Our room was in second floor and it was a superior room with jacuzzi bath inside and also a small balcony that facing the main street of via Nomentana. Although I was very impressed with the interior design of the hotel (very Italian style) and also the room, I must say that the size of the room was smaller than the standard hotel room in my country. But since I've had similar experience with hotels in London, I reckoned that with the price I've paid, I could only get the room about this size. By the way, the room costs me about EUR 225 which is equivalent to \u00a3154 for 3 nights stayed in superior room type. However, since this hotel didn't have any coffee/tea facilities in the room, me and my husband have to go out to have a cup of coffee at one of the cafe around this hotel area. (A small cup of cappuccino served in restaurant/cafe can cost you about EUR 3, very very expensive indeed. Try to have a mug of cappuccino at normal price at the self service cafe in Termini station.) Back to the hotel review, as other reviewers have said before, the lady at the reception of the hotel wasn't so friendly but she wasn't bad either. She gave us a handy city map that we found useful. The breakfast room was not so small, enough to accommodate people staying at this hotel at one time since the breakfast time was from 7 to 10 am. The room was beautifully decorated with chandeliers and lots of mirror everywhere made this room looked even bigger. Nevertheless, the breakfast was not the best I've ever had. Since I am a Muslim, I just can ate breads and cereals because the other foods served were not 'halal'. But from what I can see, the choice of foods was very limited. I didn't like the croissant since it has jam in it and not the normal butter croissant I've had in UK. The Americano coffee served by this hotel tasted awful for me. However, my husband loves the breads that this hotel served so much.

The pictures available through this site of the hotel is a pretty accurrate representation of the decor, the only difference is that in person the hotel appears darker than the pictures portray. Other than that, pretty much the same. Hotel Rooms - (2 stars / 3 stars) We booked a 5 night stay in a superior room. Upon checking in (by impatient lady) we were issued a key for room 120. When we got up to the room I thought we were mistakenly issued a standard room. The room was so small that we could barely find a place for our suit cases. Please keep in mind that we traveled pretty light (2 roller bags and a back pack). The window for the room faces a dark enclosure and the walls are covered in a gold colored fabric cloth and a gold bed takes up the rest of the space in the room. It was a strange feeling being in a room that small with that kind of decor, I almost felt like a pimp checking on his establishment. Which was kind of cool in a way at first. We stayed in the room that evening and then asked to be moved to a larger room the next morning. If we were paying 260 dollars a night, we wanted a room where we could at least open up our bags to get our clothes. So the next day we were issued the key for room 122. Ah yes, finally some room to store our bags and still be able to walk around the room without stepping all over the bed. This room was much better than room 120, but still it wasn't that large. The last issue that I should make known is that the AC system in the hotel is not very good. We couldn't open our window because we were facing a busy street so we had to deal with the hotel AC system that seemed to be barely pushing any air into the room. One minor thing to note, since we did have an opportunity to stay in two different rooms in the hotel I noticed that some TV channels available in one room wasn't available in the next and vice-versa, not a big deal but just something I noticed. Bathroom - (4 stars) They were pretty nice, not very big but big enough to do what you need to do. Room 120 didn't have a bath tub, only shower but room 122 had both tub and shower. Complimentary Breakfast - (2 stars) I usually don't eat much for breakfast so it was not a big deal for me. However I feel I must give it only 2 stars from all the complaints I heard from the other guests. First off there is not much to eat. If you get there late usually most of the items are gone and you'll have to choose from whatever is left on display. Your choices are bread rolls, some type of cake, salami and cheese and a very limited supply of fresh fruit. Not that bad but many guests were asking aloud \"Is that it?\" Again not a big deal for me since I'm fine eating a few bites for breakfast (plus I started enjoying my 10:00AM slice of pizza). One day while we were eating a man spoke loudy in the dining area about the breakfast being unacceptable and then all the other guests began agreeing with him. Next he starting saying the rooms were too small and again everyone started agreeing with him. Soon after that I grabbed my wife and left the dinning room, as entertaining as it was I knew we were in Rome and had many things to see, we would probably have other opportunites to join in a hotel mutiny in our local town of Los Angeles. Location (3 stars) It was fine for me. Porta Pia is a quieter area that is quite close to the central bus/train station. There is a bus stop almost right in front of the hotel which is quite convenient. During the day there are some street vendors and a few stores that can offer some shopping opportunities. There is also a local market around the corner where you can buy some groceries if you don't feel like eating out or just some water and drinks for the room. The prices of the grocery store is really good. Make a right when you exit to hotel, right again at the first street, walk down many 200 feet and on your right hand side you will find the door to the market. Local Area Eats (4 stars) There is actually a very good place if you make a left upon exiting the hotel. Walk to the first street and make a left again. On the right hand side of the street there is a restaurant with some reviews posted on the front door. The pasta there is great. Pretty good prices too compared to the other touristy places you will find in Rome with mediocre food.", "Date": "October 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "detroit", "Title": "\u201cI recomment it to everyone\u201d", "Author": "mry76", "ReviewID": "UR5899226", "Content": "Me and my husband spent our honeymoon at Turner Hotel and i would like to recommend to all the others couples do to the same.

Like others we did let them know it was our honeymoon. Needless to say, don't bother. We were given a beautiful room, decor was definitely Italian and have no complaints of the room. The bathroom was Italian Marble like shown in several pictures and gorgeous. I was rather hoping for a room with the jaccuzzi tub but was given on with the jaccuzzi shower instead, honestly not a big deal. We stayed on the 5th floor which the lift did not go to and had to walk a flight up from the fourth floor. Honestly wasn't a big deal to us either. The continental breakfast was very adequate and in two very nice Italian marlbed decorated rooms, very pleasant area to eat in. The hotel is about a 25 minute walk to the colliseum and other historical sights vas well as the termini. Bus route very easy to use as well. The down fall of the hotel to me was there wereno English speaking tv channels at all. we could not get pay tv as they said the computer was down. I kind of felt this was a standard excuse from the front desk(reception desk). This was rather disappointing as there really isn't much to do at night if you're not a person who likes doing night clubs. My real problem was with the reception desk. The lady on the day shift and the fellow on the afternoon shift had absolutely no personality at all and in my opinion should not be doing this type of work. Very unfriendly indeed. The gentleman on the late shift nicest guy one can meet, and very helpful with an attitude one would expect from a hotel reception desk. I'd say if Turner hotel would like to make their place better they need to address these problems and then they'd be an awesome place in which I'd love to revisit. I must say I will return to Rome but will not stay at the Turner Hotel again only due to those issues.

I had booked a junior suite with jacuzzi but when I got there I was given a normal double room. I went back downstairs to be told that my original room was being refurbished. No one had warned me about this prior to my arrival and when I complained the receptionist didnt care. I had to point out I was paying for a junior suite but only getting a double room... only then did they reduce the price. So, having been trammed round three different rooms only to realise that the best I was going to get was a double room, we settled. Our room was a 'superior room'. However the shower bracket was not securely fitted to the wall and hit me on the back of the head. Very superior! We had a balcony but it was small and dirty with no chairs. However on a more positive note the room decor was pretty, but a cigarette burn in the bed spread made me uneasy from the offset. The room had a safe which we found useful. We found the reception staff very unhelpful. My boyfriend put a 20 euro note in a ticket machine and got no ticket - we asked the guy on reception to ring the helpline. He did ring but waited on hold for 60seconds before telling us he was too busy. He promised to try again later in the day - we enquired and weren't convinced he'd bothered. Furthermore, I put my pyjamas in bed and the cleaners swiped them along with the bed linen. I asked for them back on 5 occassions to 3 different receptionists. No one either bothered to look or seemed to care! The location of this hotel, however, is great. The bus stop is literally outside the door and you can get buses to everywhere in the city. Top Tips - Ladies- make sure your shoulders are covered when you visit the vatican city - Bus 62 takes you everywhere you need - trevi fountain, vatican etc. Bus 90 takes you to the termini station. Both buses are frequent. - for 8 euros you can get a terrovision shuttle bus from ciampiano airport to the termini station, then bus number 90 takes you straight to hotel Bottom Line - if you can afford better - then choose elsewhere!

Perhaps our bathroom was a bit better than others since our shower, though small, had sliding doors around it instead of just a curtain. There was a musty/sulfury smell from the water in the toilet that was minimized by keeping the lid down. The breakfast was more than adequate - meat, cheese, rolls, croissants, sweetbreads, yogurt, fruit and cereal as well as juice and whatever kind of coffee you'd like. There are a lot of decent restaurants in the area including one fantastic pizzeria/trattoria (like a lot of Rome restaurants, it doesn't have a name) a few blocks away on Pia Alexandra?? - it is distinctive because it's pretty big, brightly lit with checkered tablecloths and is full of Italians. The pizza and pasta there were the best we had during our entire trip and we ended up going there twice while in Rome after having a mediocre dinner at one of the fancy open air cafes at Piazza Navona. While the hotel isn't right in the middle of the city centre, it's walkable if you don't mind walking. We ended up walking just about everywhere from the hotel because we couldn't be bothered most of the time with the expense of a taxi or waiting for the bus. It's a 15 minute walk from the main train station, a 15 minute walk to the Spanish Steps and a 40 minute walk from Piazza Navona (the furthest we walked). Bus #62 that stops in front of the hotel takes you all the way to St. Peter's/Vatican City (the last stop), which we did the day we spent in the Vatican City area. I recommend doing the \"110\" City Tour - it's the red double-decker buses that stop at 11 or 12 main sites through the city centre. It starts at the main train/bus station (there is a ticket office there outside - an orange/red building) but you can get on at any of the stops if there is room and pay for the ticket at the stop (13 euros). You can ride the bus all day, getting on and off at stops, until the service ends around 7:30pm. We got on at 9am our first day in Rome at the main train/bus station, did the entire 2 hour ride through the city and then decided where to get off later. I recommend getting on early since when we went through the main train/bus station to begin our second time through (it was about 11am) the line to get on the bus was LONG and hardly anyone got off so I can't imagine how long those people waited in line.", "Date": "October 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - no complaints at all!\u201d", "Author": "Grendel666", "ReviewID": "UR3985280", "Content": "We have just spent three nights in this hotel and we didn't experience any of the negative aspects of previous reviewers.

The bathroom was big enough - ok, it wasn't huge, but why do you need a huge bathroom? It had plenty of room to get undressed/dressed, have a shower, get dried, etc. The road outside was quite noisy and I thought I'd have trouble getting to sleep, but as soon as the windows and shutters were closed we couldn't hear the traffic at all - perfect. Breakfast was the same as I've found in all other Italian hotels (including some much more expensive and exclusive than this one). Don't expect a full English breakfast, because that's not what they do in Italy! There was plenty of everything and what should have been hot was hot. Location was great. We had a wander around when we arrived and ended up at the Colosseum as it was that close and basically at the end of one road. The metro is only a 5-10 mins walk and gets you to where you want to go very quickly. We didn't use the bus service as the metro was so good, but there is a bus (number 62 I think) that stops outside the hotel and takes you into the centre. Loads of restaurants close by so you have lots of choice. Walking around at night didn't bother me, people were very friendly, but we didn't stroll too far from the hotel - only a few blocks really. After a hectic and very unorganised journey to the hotel (we got the ArrivaBus from Ciampino that dropped us in the middle of an extremely busy road near Termini, with no signs of anything around, couldn't even find the metro, driver didn't care about the passengers at all, so got charged a fortune for a journey of a few minutes) we realised that we should have just got a taxi. So we asked about one in reception and they arranged a taxi to take us to the airport on the way home, which arrived early with a very friendly driver - they didn't just pick one up from the street.
