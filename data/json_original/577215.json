Its an old building, the bathrooms are a bit run down, though they get cleaned everyday. I really like the staff here, always keen for a chat and will help you with anything you need. If you are looking for luxury, you wont find it here. Though I haven't had a bad stay, Ive been able to get a good night sleep both times. I got free washing powder off the front desk guy, which was a nice surprise. They have free coffee, tea and muffins in the morning. It is only a short walk to the waterfront, Steamworks brewery and Pacific Centre. The bar downstairs is a great place to have a drink, it has many micro brewed beers on the menu from many places in the northwest.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cNot good\u201d", "Author": "karen c", "ReviewID": "UR122210273", "Content": "SO LOUD.

The room was fine, linens were clean and the bed was comfy BUT the kitchen was DISGUSTING and grungy and looked like it hadnt been cleaned in ages. The bathrooms were okay but there was no privacy in the showers. The laundry was expensive--nearly $5 to do 1 load. The \"breakfast\" was non-existent--a couple old muffins does not count as breakfast. The only issues with noise was on the weekends but my earplugs drowned it out. Except they couldn't drown out that gunshot I heard my last night there. Staff was also so RUDE. For the deposit, I was told they would not refund my card but instead give me cash back when I check out--thats not the same. The guy gave me such attitude. I was low on cash and asked if they could take my credit card info as the deposit and they refused. He couldn't give a damn and made that very clear. And when we made the reservation they forced us to pay everything upfront which ive never had at a hostel. Now I work at a hostel and know how things go, but this place needs to change its policies. Stay somewhere else, but not same sun hostel on granville!", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cPretty bad experience\u201d", "Author": "David_TripAdv", "ReviewID": "UR117503917", "Content": "The management was helpful, but the overall experience was bad. This is one of the worst hostels I've been to, and that compares to places I've visited in developing countries. The rooms were way too stuffy despite being 70 degrees outside due to poor ventilation, the noise was terrible despite the hostel no longer having bands on the ground floor, and the bathrooms were disgusting even by my low standards. That said, the management gave me a prompt refund for the unused portion of my visit and they were very nice.

I'll admit that. But don't even think about sleeping here until 4am. The walls are paper thin and you hear every footstep in the corridors. Wearing earplugs didn't help because the music from the band playing in the club 2 floors below vibrated the entire building. The rooms are tiny and cramped. It is conveniently located within walking distance of the subway, and I suppose if you are one of the revelers in the club downstairs you might find it quite convenient to just walk up a flight of stairs to your room. But I would not recommend this place for anyone else.

I was afraid of falling out of the top bunk if i had decided to sleep there as there was no rails / border around it and I had a few drinks so wasn't risking it ;) There's a pub below but you can't hear it if your on the 2nd floor so my advice is if you want a quiet (ish) sleep go on the 2nd otherwise you hear everything on the floor below.

I was particularly jetlagged and looking for a comfortable bed and a hot shower. I did not find either of these things here. The staff appeared to be uninterested and not very helpful. They ceased to give me a run down of the facilities when I checked in and provided limited information when asked about where to find things around the area. The rooms were very small and dirty with terrible linen. The mattress looked a million years old and was all springs... The bathroom was not well cleaned and provided little privacy. The hot water supply was also very limited. The noise from the downstairs bar echoed throughout the hostel and all the doors banged when left to close. The muffin breakfast was ok and fine if you couldnt be bothered going to find somewhere to fill your stomach. Limited facilities provided considering that it was in a hot spot of central Vancouver. Only positive thing was the price and even then it was excessive for what it provided.

This is the most disgusting hostel I have ever seen. We stayed here for 5 nights last week. Problems started straight away. The persn checking us in was ore bothered about her conversation and looked at us like we wer aliens! My partner and I shared a double room which consisted of a double bed that had nail clippings and unknown hair in it, and a table rammed into a single room. This was beyond basic, no mirrors, stripped floorboards, disgusting unpainted walls. There was dirt and dust where you really wouldn't expect to find it. The first night was horrible we didn't get to sleep until 4am due to the VERY loud bar downstairs and the traffic going past the room and noisy, drunken louts outside. This continued every night for 4 nights. Expect no sleep and if you do manage a little expect to be woken up by the maid with her mp3 player on loudspeaker. She seems to only pace the hall outside making as much noise as possible. Our room wasn't cleaned once! The only person who tried to get in was a Russian bloke who unlocked the door whilst my boyfriend was in bed and tried to barge in. Luckily my boyfriend blocked him. The bathrooms were like something out of a horror story! No locks on the doors, blood, hair and god know's what else in the bottom of the shower trays. Expect no privacy and either freezing water or water hot enough to skin you. There are also only 2 showers and 2 toilets (in the same room) per floor. If disgusting rooms, unfriendly staff, horrible restrooms and music till 4am doesn't put you off this hostel on our last night a mouse ran out of one of the many holes in the wall, explains the scurrying we heard every night!!!!", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cA hostel over a bar....
