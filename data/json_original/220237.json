Our check-out bill was rather complicated but the staff figured it out correctly the first time. The location just a short (downhill) walk to the convention center, and there are a range of restaurant choices within just a few blocks. Being an older, historic hotel, the bathrooms are on the small side, but they've included multiple shelves to hold all of the things modern travelers seem to require in the bathroom. And I was pleased to find not one, but two luggage racks in the closet, along with two comfy hotel robes. The negative: Wireless internet is comparatively expensive ($15.95 per day) and the connection, at least in my room, was incredibly weak, slow, and unreliable. I found that I was compelled to do any actual internet-based work while at the Convention Center because the wifi there was so much more stable and strong. Also, I somehow found the entrance to the parking garage to be confusing. Although the hotel address is on Georgia Street, the actual driveway is around the other side, which was tricky to navigate during rush hour with one-way streets.

We arrived about 10 minutes early and expected to wait, but were instead shown to a lovely table at the railing with two wing back chairs-so comfortable! Our waiter came over to give us the tea menus and fill our water glasses. Once we decided (Fairmont Earl Grey for me and Fairmont Orange Pekoe for her) our tea pots were brought to the table filled with loose tea in a strainer and very hot water-if the water isn't hot enough the tea will not be as good, and after a short time to steep we poured our tea-perfection! The china is very colouful made especially for the Fairmont Hotels and coupled with the silver teapots and cream and sugar service makes the experience even more special-Victorian elegance worthy of such a grand hotel! The staff were very busy and walked smartly between tables, but we did not wait long for our tiered tray of goodies! The staff was very efficient without being rushed and brought hot water refills regularly for our teapots. The sandwiches were excellent-smoked salmon, ham and Brie croissant, curried chicken salad, watercress and cucumber-delicious! The scones were still warm and moist when cut open, heavenly with the clotted cream and jam!! The final pastries were a mini chocolate cupcake, lemon tart, and two others which I can't recall. We were hungry due to skipping breakfast (on purpose so not to spoil our appetite!) and we ate everything! The amount of food was just right for us, but many people had to have some of the treats packed up as they ran out of room! The service throughout our meal was excellent, and I felt the cost was very reasonable at CAD 36.00 + tax per person.

Knowing what I was in for, I had no hesitation booking a junior suite for my most recent trip, which required me to stay downtown for three days. Sometimes things change with time, and there have been occasions when I returned to a favourite hotel only to be disappointed. Not so here, as the Hotel Vancouver once again exceeded all of my expectations. As I've written in previous reviews on this hotel, the location cannot be beat. With its central position right in the heart of Vancouver's downtown core, everything from Stanley Part to BC Place stadium and GM Place to Robson street shopping is within easy walking distance. It's also an easy half-block to the Skytrain. The Hotel Van is a heritage building, and you cannot help but feel the tremendous elegance that envelopes you as you walk inside and look around the lobby. The hustle and bustle of Vancouver disappears, and you've stepped back in time - not just to a world of marble and brass, but to the type of friendly, graceful and efficient service that seems altogether too rare today. You're treated like royalty from the moment you approach the door, and made to feel like you're the one and only customer the hotel has ever had. How wonderful that feels after a long day of traveling. The hotel's restaurant (Griffins) serves a varied menu, while you can also get snacks and drinks in the open lobby bar. I dined at both - sood was great, service impeccable. My room was utterly spotless, well furnished, and with perhaps the most comfortable hotel bed ever. I have no idea what the thread count on the linen might have been, but it was soft as can be and appeared to be new. Multiple pillows of different density is always a nice touch, and I truly appreciated the nightly turn-down service, complete with a small bottle of water waiting at my bedside. A trip to the bath revealed enough towels to dry a small army, all of them thick, plush and soft as the linens. My room had a walk-in shower, so I really enjoyed all the space. I did make use of the hotel's health club, and found it to be quite good. The equipment is all in new condition, perfectly maintained, and the towel racks were full. Several other guests also made use of the facility while I was there, yet no one seemed to get in anyone else's way, so the layout and allocation of different machines seems good. I didn't use the pool. The hotel has two beautiful and extremely well behaved Labrador retrievers who hang around the concierge desk, waiting to take guests for a walk. Make the time to take a spin around the block with one (or both) of them. It will be the best five minutes of your day. Finally, I have to say it again - the service is what really sets this hotel apart. Yes it's a great building, yes it's crazy clean and tidy, but few places leave you feeling as valued as a customer as the Fairmont. It's truly in a league of its own.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nad", "Title": "\u201cVancouver British Columbia\u201d", "Author": "ddie", "ReviewID": "UR124304650", "Content": "This is an old world elegant hotel.

We arrived at 2 p.m. and they weren't busy at that time, so my door was opened for me, our luggage was hauled out for us and we were off to the reception desk in no time. Note that you drive to the 'back' of the hotel through a drive-thru to get to Valet parking. Don't go to the front of the hotel on the main streets (Georgia St. or Burrard St.). At Reception, we had no line-up at all and went straight to the desk clerk. I asked about 'upgrading' as we were booked in a Fairmont Room and, based on other reviewers feedback (Thank You!), we decided to spend the extra $100 and upgrade to the Fairmont Gold floor, corner room. It was a great decision as the room couldn't have been better. We got complimentary appetizers in the evening (5-7 p.m.) before dinner, and a wonderful hot/cold breakfast the next morning - with a nutritious assortment to choose from. They have a DVD player in the room and a complimentary assortment of DVD's to choose from in the hospitality suite. Internet is free on this floor (which we didn't use), plus many other amenities which we didn't need. This is the 9th floor of the hotel and we found the traffic below to be a muted noise - although you will definitely hear any sirens going by. My husband used their gym facilities and was quite pleased (they are 24/7). There were 4 treadmills with built-in T.V.'s, 4 elipticals, and, sadly, only one weight room cubbyhole big enough for 1 person. So, he decided to use their kinetic weights - which he had never used before - and enjoyed them more than using his regular weights. Also they had stationary bikes, etc. Very well-equipped and better than all the hotels we've ever stayed in he said. We used their 900 West Lounge once in the afternoon and once in the late evening. Service was superb. Be expected to pay more for your drinks here than you probably would someplace else, but the ambiance is really wonderful and felt the whole experience was worth it. There is a local pub on Burrard Street about 2 blocks up and on the same side of the street as the hotel (going west). For shopping, you couldn't ask for a better location! Robson Street, with mostly upscale shops is only a 1/2 block away. The huge Pacific Centre Shopping Mall is only 2 blocks away. There are many boutique shops in the area.

The real hassle came when i tried to log onto Wi-Fi, which i should get complimentary for being a Fairmont Presidents Club member. For some reason, I couldn't connect. I was transfered around between guest services and front desk for it seemed like forever, and nobody seemed to want to own the problem, which upset me. Finally i was transfered to some Internet Support division, and they stated that they did not have me identified as a guest at the hotel. Somebody else was registered in my room! Well back to guest services, and finally they admitted to a \"glitch\" at check-in, and they did some magic and registered me in properly. This process wasted an hour of my short day. Then a couple of days later, my room key would not work in the elevator or my room. I went to the front desk, and they replaced my key, without an apology or anything resembling a sense of concern. My biggest problem with ths hotel is that the staff don't seem to really care about the guest experience. From the many times i called the front desk and they called me by another name (remember the glitch) when i told them it wasn't me, to the general lack of ownership, I think that the management are riding the Fairmont name too proudly. The guest experience should be very similar to the Fairmont Pacific Rim down the street, which sadly it doesnt even come close.

We arrived by taxi, and as we got out, at the main door, the doorman seemed so engrossed in speaking with someone else, that we were totally ignored. What annoys me, in North America, is that chasing a tip often comes above serving the customer, and that was certainly the case here. We managed our bags ourselves, and at reception later, I was asked if I needed help with our luggage. Quite why hotels ask this question, when any decent establishment would already have taken care of it, is a mystery to me. The lobby of this hotel is bustling with activity, and I had a short term urge to ignore what had happened upon arrival, and just enjoy being there. A choir of young children was performing, and they sang beautifully. Although Christmas is some way off, it certainly put me in the mood. Check in was quick, polite and easy. I was offered an upgrade 'for a little extra' money. I refused, because when you book a room, at a prestigious hotel, you expect your room to be good enough. I should have heard alarm bells ringing in my head, when the receptionist said, 'You're with Expedia sir', as if that made me unworthy. I hadn't booked through Expedia, so I was a little surprised to hear this. In future, I will take this as being a secret code for 'you need to upgrade'. We stepped out of the lift on our floor, and I suddenly knew that we we'd made a mistake. The floor we were staying on seemed barren and bare, and somehow unloved and neglected. Our room was I'm sure, in its day, very nice. But that was a long long time ago. The Fairmont intro channel on the tv made no sense, advising us to keep our personal effects in the in-room safe- There wan't one...! We were warned that if we removed anything from the mini-bar we'd be charged for it. I couldn't even open the fridge door. There were no slippers, no plants or flowers, and the room was very dusty. The bathroom wallpaper was beginning to fall off the walls, and spots of mould grew in the ceiling corners. The plus point, was that the bed itself was very comfortable. I cannot think of any other things that were worthy of a positive mention, bar the hotel's location. This hotel could not be better- Five minutes from the waterfront, two minutes from the Pacific Centre, surrounded by good restaurants, and the hotel also houses some of the best shops in Vancouver. I have a simple policy, if the room meets expectations, spend in the hotel. If not, don't. So we never tried out any of the dining choices, so I'm unable to comment there. We did however use the swimming pool. It was dimly lit, and nobody using it seemed to know that through the gym, there were changing rooms. There were no staff around to tell people this, and because the surrounding area to the pool was small, many people changed in a somewhat embarrassed way, by the side of it. It did seem funny that people were arriving in shoes and boots, but then again, like us, I suppose they found no slippers in the wardrobe. I wouldn't stay again, but I suppose that goes without saying. Staff at this hotel, when you can get their attention, are very friendly, as are most Canadians.

I will say I was generally pleased with my stays, and I realize that this is a big city landmark hotel, but I am a little tired of seeing these large bills before my eyes. I remember eating dinner there in 1986 and the main dining room was called the Timber Club. When I dined there again in 1999, it was something else, but apparently the layout has been changed since then. I enjoyed my meaks at Griffin's, but the trend seems to be toward more casual dining in these places, rather than catering to the old ladies with blue hair. I guess that makes sense. As a matter of principle, I refuse to use those hotel minibars. $9 for a Budweiser? I don't think so. The rooms I had were spacious and comfortable, and I agree with others - more shelf space is needed in the bathrooms. I made use of the exercise room and pool. Now this item is something that I am a crank about, but I appreciate good music and the \" contemporary rock \" or whatever it is called is banal and offensive to my ears. I did mention this to one manager, and I don't expect it to necessarily change because of my comment, but I wish they would just turn that crap off! Also, on my second stay of three nights, one night's worth of valet parking crept into my bill - this was when I had arrived by train. It was promptly removed without any discussion, but stuff like that is annoying. I am in Jasper, Alberta at the moment, crossing Canada by train and will stay in a few days at the Fairmont Royal York in Toronto, but porposely did not stay at the Jasper Park Lodge, as I do not wish to look at another huge bill.

Best Ive ever had! The desserts are great too!). Apparently Queen Elizabeth the 2nd was at the opening of this hotel. Anyway, the staff was classy and helpful. The Concierge personnel are great! Really nice and friends and they take the time to really speak to you and not rush you off because some bozo is standing impatiently behind you peering in wanting his/her turn like NOW. They really add a personal touch to all of their interactions with guests no matter what room type they take or if they are on a govt rate as we were. Two precious dogs, Mavis and Beau, await you if you wish to pet, visit or walk them (their schedule is usually flexible :)) They are yellow lab/golden retrievers and are soooo cute and kind. Really well-behaved. Mavis gives you a paw to greet you and both can do tricks! Hehehe. Really nice dogs. Their owners are super nice as well! What is great about this is, if you miss your pet, you can have a bit of the comfort of having one while on vacation. The rooms were clean and perfectly spacious. We were in a double queen size room and then switched to a King Deluxe room due to adding an extra day and availability or some such. The King room was huge! Ha! The Queen room was a regular sized room and perfect. Tip: Use your card in the elevator to go up, especially at night. We werent told by the check in lady, so we looked pretty stupid haha. It happens to a lot of people though. Also, try the pool/hot tub after a long day on the town, it is really nice and usually not too busy. Finally, do call ahead to book High Tea reservations, you will be greeted and served by super friendly staff who allow you to take silly pictures of yourselves or just the food. Heheh.

I\u2019ve had business dinners, some conferences, etc. at this hotel, and the staff always do everything they can to make a great experience.

I stayed in Room 1253, I paid for a Fairmont Room but it seemed larger than most Fairmont Rooms I've stayed in. The room has undergone the recent renovations they are going through with lovely colour choices (Royal Purple, Gold and Creams and Whites) which brings it to Classic Modern Elegance. I pulled up late in the evening, valeted my vehicle and did curbside check-in (which I love of course). Upon arrival I was presented with a coupon for 15% dining or 25% off in Room Dining and it was as if they had read my mind. I freshed up a bit and then ordered a simple Prime Rib Burger and Gingerale from the In Room Dining Menu. The gentleman that took my order said it would be up in 30 minutes, at 9:30PM. As if by clockwork at 9:30 there was a knock at my door with a delightful girl with my dinner waiting. Now it could have been that I had an exhausting day and it was getting late, but I swear that was the best burger I have ever had. The spiced fries were very nice as well.

Like a number of Fairmont hotels it is an ex-CPR hotel built during the railway era with acertain amount of opulence. Entering the hotel, it has an expansive lobby with upmarket shopping stores on site. We found the staff on reception helpful and welcoming. The time and date of our arrival coincided with a Stanley Cup hockey game so hotel and bar area were noisy and crowded. We were given a room on the 11th floor with views over a section of downtown. The room was a good size although the bathroom was on the small side. We found the concierge helpful in booking trips and in detailing how to use the skytrain and bus network which is excellent. The breakfast was exactly as experienced in our stay in the Fairmont Empress, Victoria, excellent, with a choice of buffet or a la carte. The dining room offered dinner at 50% off the a la carte menu before 6pm and a fixed price table d'hote menu for $23. We had dinner on two occasions during our weeks stay, but dined out otherwise in the vast choice of restaurants in the vicinity. In conclusion, if you are looking for a hotel with excellent service, and offering something different from modern concrete towers, then the Fairmont Vancouver is certainly worth considering. If we return to Vancouver on holiday we would certainly stay in the Fairmont Vancouver hotel again, but ensure it did not coincide with the end of the ice hockey season after experiencing the riots and chaos resulting from the final game of the Stanley Cup.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice rooms but a little overpriced for what you get.\u201d", "Author": "travellots61", "ReviewID": "UR115172874", "Content": "I travel often for both business and pleasure.

The room was incredibly hot and stuffy, even when we set the temperature to low, and tried opening the window: unfortunately the windows have been 'locked' to only open a few inches (apparently the hotel said this is to stop people throwing things out the window?). In the morning we called to complain and were told that the thermostat didn't actually work, as the hotel has an old heating system and can only be set overall to either hot or cold - not set on an individual room basis. Consequently, we got virtually no sleep either night. Whilst the hotel did provide a fan (ineffective) they had no other suggestions and did not provide complimentary water. On Saturday night we called and asked to use the complimentary (for President's Club members) car shuttle: after 5 minutes the concierge called us back to say that while they had a car available for that purpose and it was a service they should offer, they didn't have anyone with a valid driving license available to drive us, adding that this was a common issue and they rarely had anyone with a driving license. He instead told us to get a taxi - which is what we had to do. Finally, when we checked out on Sunday (which we looked forward to doing) we were told that we should have asked and they would have moved us to a different room: not helpful as when we asked after the first night they said there was no point in moving as the whole hotel was on the same heating system.

The feeling of the hotel working with less than optimal staffing is also suggested by the fact that on two separate arrivals and departures we only spied a member of the bell desk on one occasion.

Unfortunately the decor is getting tired and the whole feel is that the place is in need of a refurbishment. The reception and concierge service was excellent but housekeeping and room service were less impressive. To illustrate, we had just arrived in Vancouver after a long flight from Australia - the receptionist managed to get us into a room on our early arrival so that we could shower and rest before our relations arrived later in the day. We were very happy with that but less happy when someone from housekeeping woke us up asking when we were going to vacate the room. The rooms were cleaned promptly and well but on several occasions things were not replaced and then we had problems rectifying the situation. For example - the coffee machine in the room is a lovely idea that other hotels would do well to emulate but the brownie points for putting it in disappear when the coffee used is not replaced during the standard room service visit requiring, in our case, four phone calls to rectify. There were problems with our room phone. It constantly showed a flashing light indicating a message when there was none. Also the short cut buttons did not work seeming to send any call to the restaurant. Both issues were reported but no apparent effort was made to rectify them during our stay. Our room was very spacious and the bed was very comfortable but the air conditioning was incredibly noisy. We were located in the original bit of the building and the windows are not double glazed so we also had a lot of traffic noise.

He picture on www.fairmont.com/HotelVancouver/ showing the chairs (with flower patterns) and coffee tables in the lobby is deceiving and completely inaccurate. The sit-down area no longer exists and has been replaced with a watch shop (Omega from memory). I also visited the levels above the lobby and it was grand. Marble staircases, and elegant and classy decorations. Now the rooms. My room was plush, clean and of an adequate size. The decor was attractive and beautifully appointed and it was evident that the hotel staff were extremely attentive to detail. There was a luxurious collection of soaps, shampoos, body lotions etc. but the internet was not complimentary which I think is unacceptable for the amount I was paying.

There were no porters to help carry my luggage - as a group of twelve, we were all carrying our skis, boot bags and luggage for a 2.5 week holiday. I was unimpressed by this lack of service which I expect from all 5 star hotels. We had to later carry all the luggage to our rooms. Ignoring my criticisms, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here.

They are renowned for having the most wonderful properties with elegant facilities and superb service worldwide. Unfortunately none of this can be said for the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver in Vancouver, British Columbia. After arrival at 10:30 AM and what seemed to be good check in service, seeing the actual rooms assigned demonstrated that the room preferences requested during reservations were not taken into consideration. Apparently, although the reservations were made several months prior to the date of check-in, and were confirmed by phone on several occasions prior to arrival, the king size beds requested were not in the rooms that were assigned. While this was not a difficult thing to have corrected, it was an indication that the upcoming service would not be the experience that Fairmont promises in their brochures, websites and other advertising. It was also not what was expected from the very high, premium prices that were paid to stay at a Fairmont property. Being able to see the \u201cwrong rooms\u201d was also telling in allowing me to see the actual quality of more than the rooms assigned to me for the two day stay. Carpet was threadbare and/or dirty. Bathrooms had de-laminating showers and tubs and/or cracked old tiles. There were no vanities or place to put toilet articles and in fact no bathroom counter or shelving at all. Towel racks are ridiculously placed in the shower itself so that towels would be soaked if left there while taking a shower. There was no other place to put towels while showering other than on the floor, in the sink, or on the toilet. This was the case in all three rooms that were seen in the hotel. After explaining that I did not have a king size bed as stated on the reservation I was told I could change rooms. I was also told by the hotel desk to leave my luggage and that it would be in my new room when I returned late that afternoon (after 5:00 PM). Needless to say my luggage was not in my new room when I returned and had been left in the first room I was assigned. This was quickly remedied but there should not have been the need to have it corrected, it should have happened as I was assured it would. The room that I ended up in was stuffy, with air conditioning that could not keep it cool. Although it was never extremely hot outside, and the room was in the shadows, the air conditioning would never bring the temperature down below 72 degrees Fahrenheit, 22 Celsius. Engineering was called and I was told that the air conditioning was working at its utmost efficiency and it would not get cooler. The engineer was honest enough to say that the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver was an old building with old systems and that this was one of the problems with it. I received the same answer when the same engineer worked on the hot water, or lack thereof. Other than being scalded regularly when any toilet in the hotel was flushed, the water in the shower was only luke-warm at any time. I was told that with the risers (pipes) designed as they are in this outdated hotel that it might take time for hot water to get to my room. (This did not make sense as I was able to be scalded intermittently when a toilet was flushed.) Even when the hot water was left running overnight to make sure that there was enough time to let it get to my room, it only flowed luke-warm. Again the engineer said that this was the case with all the rooms on the both wings of the hotels and that there might be a better chance of getting hot water in rooms by the elevators if I wanted to move again. I was offered another change of rooms but having already seen three rooms in the hotel, and being unpacked I did not wish to again change rooms. The purpose of a hotel is to make guests comfortable upon arrival, not by continually moving them from one room to another. Fairmont management was very apologetic for my troubles and lack of basic facilities, like towel racks, bathroom counters, appropriate ventilation, and hot water, but I do not book a hotel for apologies, I try to choose a hotel and pay premium prices for comfortable rooms and quality service. I received wonderful apologies but never any service or comfort. I was promised by management that the Fairmont Hotels I would be staying at over the course of my travels during the next week (Banff Springs, Calgary Palliser) would be notified and that all would be perfect over my next seven days. This also turned out to be more false hope. While the Fairmont's hotel buildings themselves may be beautiful, the accommodations at the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver, Fairmont Banff Springs and Fairmont Calgary Palliser are old, dilapidated facilities of once past glory. They now remind me of 1950 style European tourist class hotels. To put the name Fairmont on these building is the equivalent of putting lipstick on a pig. In both cases you are wasting your time, and you annoy the pig. Here the only one to be annoyed is the hotel guest who has paid premium prices for far less than mediocre facilities.", "Date": "June 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Nelson, BC", "Title": "\u201cGrande dame didn't disappoint-elegant, refined yet casual\u201d", "Author": "CDickie", "ReviewID": "UR32771441", "Content": "Room was large, wonderfully appointed and with a curious small space (luggage, dressing?) and no full length mirror.

We love beautiful historic hotels. We have never had a problem at the Vancouver Fairmont before either. However-. this time we stayed one night in a Junior Suite, after a Christmas party. We weren't in the room that much before our party, but later on that evening when we went to bed we heard alot of talking from the next room to us (thin walls?) and for some reason a service -type door kept opening and shutting across from our room, which we also heard through out the night! Most rooms we have had in the past at any Fairmont Hotel are quiet, no problem. We did notice that this particular suite had the bed as soon as you walked into the room very close to the wall and entrance door, and the sitting area/tv room was a seperate room closer to the window. Maybe the configuration of our room contributed to us hearing noise in the hallway, but we felt the walls seemed thin. Our check in was okay, but the staff were not very friendly except for the valet/car men, who were friendly and welcoming.After check in and on our way to the elevator, we went over to the dog they have in their lobby and the person who handles the dog didn't smile, look at us, nothing....no 'welcome to the Fairmont... the dogs name is..such and such'....nothing! Very unfriendly. We had paid for another couple's room (jr. suite like ours) so we wanted to make sure all charges for them and ourselves were put on to our bill. Upon our check out early the next day,my husband was given the final bill which he paid for, but because we asked the woman at the front desk a few questions about some charges on our bill (which she clearly wasn't happy about) she called out her supervisor who was condescending towards my questions. The charges were correct- no problem. When we went to get our car and leave, the valet man told us that there had been quite a few staff changes the last 6 months. Maybe that is the problem, but their customer service -hospitality needs to be worked on. There are many beautiful hotels in the downtown Vancouver area. The Fairmont is beautiful and if you get a quiet room you will enjoy your stay, but alot of the staff we experienced were very unprofessional for that class of a hotel.", "Date": "December 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Witham, Essex", "Title": "\u201cOh my god - wow!\u201d", "Author": "Skye82", "ReviewID": "UR22054480", "Content": "Wow, is the best word to describe this hotel.

This is certainly a grand old hotel which is in a great location. Its only about 2 minutes from Robson Street in one direction and the Pacific Centre Mall in the other. Its also only about a 15 minute walk at most, to Gastown. So I'm not sure you could do much better from a location point of view. We had mixed experience regarding accomodation however. We originally booked what should have been a great room on the 14th floor. But found ourselves close to the service elevators that kept us awake all night. Also while the lobby is great, I found the hotel in general a bit \"gloomy\" given the dark wood everywhere and fairly drab decore. But this is to be expected given the age of the building and on that front I guess the hotel has done a good job in keeping the original feel. But given our experience with the room we moved the next day onto the Fairmont Gold floor. And boy what a difference. Very elegant, well decorated, exceptional servive, light and airy and with very well appointed rooms. So I would have to say that if we stayed in the general area of the hotel, I may have come away a little disappointed. But on the Gold floor I was very happy. I dont think the Fairmont could have been better in terms of location and overall the hotel is elegant. But if you are expecting the rooms to match the elegance of the foyer, I think you would have to stay on the Fairmont Gold floor.

Again, it was a wonderful stay, and I'd return in a minute. I had a standard room, #575, that overlooked a side street, but not bad when the view is of Tiffany and a Ports 1961 shop. Other than the occasional emergency siren, we were not bothered by street noise. The hotel is well located to shopping, cafes, restaurants, the musuem, transit options (e.g. express bus to the U of British Columbia, as well as the regular bus routes.) It is an easy walk to English Bay, Stanley Park, the ferry to Granville Island, etc. if you don't mind a 15 minute walk. The room was very comfortable and a good size. The beds were supremely comfortable, with 4 pillows per bed (I'm sure you could get other types if you ask.) I am VERY thankful that this hotel includes a top sheet as well as the duvet-style blanket that many hotels have gone towards. This means that I can use a little cover if I feel warm, but not have to crank up the AC as when some hotels try to save money by omitting the top sheet. The room came with two club chairs and a table, and a large writing desk. Very good internet connections. Complete coffee/tea service, i.e. a coffee pot AND an electric tea kettle. Flat screen TV, iron/board, minibar, umbrella, and walk-in closet. What I missed: no in-room safe (surprising for a good higher-end business class hotel.) There was enough room to have two suitcases set out on luggage racks, if needed. It would have been nice to have had more than 3 drawers and the nightstand, but I'm getting picky. Complimentary shoe shine service. Spotless housekeeping all around. Very minor picky points: the maid forgot the bathroom waterglasses one day; coffee for the coffee service another. Otherwise, everthing was fine. ( I suppose I shouldn't complain when I had the nerve to grab the gorgeous orchid bud vase from a past-used breakfast cart in the hall -- how can you send that out when it was in such perfect condition? We kept it in our room.) The bathroom has a generous assortment of toiletries from Miller Harris - shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, body lotion, soaps. Some may not want the light citrus fragrance, but we fragrance junkies love it. The pedestal sink has a good-size rim to catch stuff, and the glass shelves provide a lot of room for your own toiletries. I LOVE the fact that the room comes with 2 robes. The tub is a bit dated, but large. Complaint: the water control is located for someone standing up in the shower, not comfortable for someone taking a bath. The service everywhere, including the shops, was friendly, helpful, and efficient. My guest sharing the room made a lot of use of the concierges, and was able to run all over town and interesting neighborhoods with great aplomb and confidence. Trust the concierges' restaurant recommendations. Other reviewers complained of long waits -- this was never a problem. Vancouver has great shopping, but you might also want to peruse the hotel shops -- hair and body treats in the salon in the lower level, a Snowflake shop for women's clothing, outerwear, and accessories. Try the maple candies in the newstand/gift shop. Gucci, Vuitton, and St. John shops are also on site. The cocktail lounges are lovely in the grand hotel fashion, with a pianist at cocktails, and singer in the evening. Very good cocktails, wines, etc. although the champagne by the glass was a little pricey ($25 CN - such are French imports.) There is also afternoon tea served here. It would be a nice respite even if you weren't staying at the hotel, but if you were shopping in the area or at the musuem, or stopping for drinks. The hotel has a very nice glassed-in pool on a rooftop, changing room, and spa. The pool is not resort-size enormous, but as good as can be expected in town, and you can do laps. The gym seemed well fitted, but I was more interested in walking in the nice weather. We ate all our meals elsewhere. Vancouver is a great food city, and the weather was fine, so we wanted to get out. Also: there are numerous cafes and coffee shops in the area for breakfast. I am a member of the Fairmont President's Club, but did not book into the club level this trip. The amenities for those rooms have been great in the past, but between conference rates and my schedule, we dedcided not to. On the next trip here, I should investigate. Our stay in the standard room was very nice, but the club level has often added to the enjoyment. Did you know that there is a house dog you can walk if you want to feel like a local? Beau or Mavis is available, and beautifully behaved dogs (Labradors.) Fair warning if you are alergic to dogs -- they reside by the concierge desk. To wrap up -- this is a wonderful stay in a wonderful city in a wonderful location. Even with a conference and other guests, the hotel was lively but not overwhelmed by people (six well-functioning elevators and segregated conference floors helped.)

We had little time and were suffering from a jetlag, so we didn't swim or anything but overall it was a wonderfull stay. The only downside about our stay was our breakfast. We had ordered our breakfast in our room, but I think we did something wrong because we only had four small pieces of toast and a can of coffee delivered in our room.

Our son asked us if he could give him some toast and eneded up feeding him his entire breakfast through the window...(lol) A little later, Just before we left the room I couldn't find my credit card anywhere. I tried to think back and was almost certain the reception still had it. We went down to the lobby and I asked the receptionist if they still had it, as I couldn't remember getting it back.

While he was doing that more employees started helping him and at one point there were five members of hotel staff looking for my card.

Location can't be beat. I travelled from Seattle via Amtrak. Tip: Take the \"sky train\" light rail from the station near the train station to the Burrard station, and walk less than a block to the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver. Alternately, a cab takes about 5-7 minutes and costs about $7. During my stay, I made use of my room, the concierge desk and Griffith's (the cafe/restaurant). Also, due to the toiletries in the room being oranged-based (I have an allergy to orange), I had a special request for alternate toiletries that was handled by the front desk. (Just letting you know what I will and won't be discussing.) First, the room. In contrast to reviews that cited rooms that were dated, a bit worn, or small, I had a nice-sized room with a king bed, dresser (with LCD TV on top), desk, and table and chairs. Everything was in tip-top shape, and the mattress was the kind with a firmly-defined edge (which I really like). My closet wasn't the walk-in kind that one review cited; it had sliding doors. As others have mentioned, the bathrooms are a bit dated, but well-maintained, and frankly, the porcelain pedestal sink idea is trendily antique these days. I have an allergy to tobacco and am very sensitive to air quality, and I had no problems in this hotel. I also opened the window about an inch to further add some fresh air \"just in case\". Second, the concierge desk. They had great information when I talked to them, and seemed to have great information for others. It didn't have the feel of many concierge desks where they steer you to the places from which the hotel gets a kickback, and I appreciated that. The challenge was getting to talk to them, because apparently every other guest knows their staff is really useful as well! Most of the times I wanted concierge assistance, there was a line. In one case, the guest in front of me required 15 minutes of assistance, asking more than a dozen questions... and I had one simple question to ask, that I couldn't ask until they were done (oh, and did I mention that there had been others in the queue in front of them? I waited upwards of 20 minutes that time to speak to a concierge). Once a consultation has gone on for 10 minutes, and includes waiting while guests look over menus and ask questions, maybe a polite stall tactic is appropriate, as in, \"Here, why don't you take a look at these menus and gather up some more questions while I see if I can assist the next person in line?\". It's tough to balance showing customer service to the current party *and* customer service to waiting parties in that situation. I'm not sure what the right answer is. Third, Griffith's. The breakfast buffet may SEEM expensive, but if you get two sides and two different drinks (juice and tea), you can find yourself spending nearly as much, for much less food. Another reviewer indicated that this felt like a standard hotel cafe. I agree, and I don't mind that, because if it had been more formal, I might have felt out of place in my Seattle polar fleece and khakis. ;-) Fourth, service for my strange special request. Let me say that I don't like that so many hotels are moving to orange-based things (cleaners, toiletries, etc.). Some people (including me) react as poorly to orange as others do to peanut. That being said, my request for alternate toiletries was initially handled by the staff picking some up from the hotel sundries shop, and then later delivering a set of the older toiletries they'd used for their Gold floor rooms before those were replaced by the orange ones. This is my fourth trip to Vancouver. I haven't been impressed by any other hotels I've stayed in here.

Upon research, we decided on the Fairmont Vancouver Downtown (based upon reviews on Tripadvisor). The hotel is in an excellent location, it's worth the 4-5 star rating for it's accommodations (see below), but mostly the professionalism of the staff both at the concierge desk and presidents club desk (tip, get a membership in presidents club, it's free, and there are upgrades and perks at the hotel). All of the staff was helpful in directions, places to see, etc. including assisting in obtaining tickets to the hockey game and other entertainment in the city. The hotel is across the street from the Art Gallery, two blocks from the main shopping street in Vancouver, and the underground mall. As well as, five blocks from old town (Gastown area) and China Town, .8 km (1/2 mile) from the Arena and Stanley Park. Inside the hotel there's a Gucci Store among other high end retail establishments, including Tiffany's across the street. Amenities in the hotel are top of the line, the rooms are large, with a small walk in closet, and a full size bathroom and tub.. There is no safe in the room but there's a minibar. There's an indoor pool, Hot Tub, children's splash pool, dry sauna, and full workout facility are complimentary for all hotel guests. There are a few restaurants in the hotel, including room service, we only ate at the lounge (the food was expensive, usual for hotels) but decent. The afternoon Tea Time was pleasant and enjoyable. Overall, the Fairmont exceeded expectations, the staff treated all guests (from what we observed) including ourselves with class and exceptional service, whether a Preferred Member or regular guest. The service was better than most other Platinum/Gold/etc. membership service that other hotels have on site throughout North America from my experience. Upon returning to Vancouver we plan on staying at the hotel again. Additional tips: fly directly into YVR (Vancouver), customs is quick/easy, since driving from Seattle takes 3+ hours each way. Car rentals are inexpensive, but parking isn't downtown (around $25+ a day). Taxi's are the preferred method of transportation, and are inexpensive, around $30 to/from the airport (most taxi's are Hybrids). Public transportation is readily available and goes everyone, walking is safe and easy too throughout the downtown area. There's a coffee shop on almost every corner, on one corner there were two Starbucks across from one another and a local coffee shop on the other.

On top of having low rates, you can collect \"dollar points\" everytime you book a hotel through them that can be used towards future bookings. Very cool! I paid $135 CAD per night for a Fairmont Room (king bed). I arrived around noon on a Thursday. Check in was quick and I was immediately given a room. The room was rather on the small side but I was by myself so I didn't mind. I thought the furninshings were beautiful and in great condition. The bathroom is average size but could definitely be remodeled. The bathtub/sink/toilet are old and need to be replaced. The tub was so old that it looks like one of those tubs that never quite looks clean regardless of how much you scrub. There was a LCD TV in the room, but the hotel does not appear to have HD cable, which makes the picture kind of distorted (either that or Paris Hilton has put on a LOT of weight!) Overall, the room was clean but could have been cleaner (note comments about the tub and the furniture probably hadn't been properly dusted in a week or two). The bed was VERY comfortable however, I slept well. Overall, I thought the room was very quiet. No street noise and I couldn't hear my neighbours in the room next door. There was some noise in the hallways but that didn't really bother me. The location of the hotel is perfect. I used to live in Vancouver and I know the downtown area quite well. I couldn't imagine a better spot to be in for tourists. Robson street is a block away, the Pacific Centre (big downtown mall is also a block away). The seabus to North Vancouver (towards Capilano Suspension Bridge and Grouse Mountain) is a quick 10 minute walk from the hotel. Stanley park is a 15-20-minute leasurely walk along the seawall from the hotel. There are plenty of restaurants and shopping within a three block radius. And it's in a safe part of town, so no worrie there. You can also take the skytrain at the Pacific Centre, which again is about a 90 second walk away. Food- I ate at the Griffins restaurant one night and had a delicious steak (really well cooked, and I'm picky about my steak). I also had brunch on the Saturday, which was also quite good. But at 26$ + tax + tip a head, I would probably give a pass. There are a few restaurants just outside the hotel that serve a good breakfast for a lot less. Overall, service was quite friendly. I had a late afternoon flight and they let me keep my room a couple of hours after check out at no extra cost. I saw the dogs a couple of times in the lobby. They're definitely adorable but I've never seen dogs so blas\u00e9 about getting attention from humans. Clearly they're getting too much of it (which is better than not enough I suppose)!

Our package included suite accommodations and breakfast daily with two tickets to the special exhibit at the museum. The room was very nice, with a large sitting area, though the bathroom was quite small and cramped for two people to be in at once. The hotel thoughtfully sent us a afternoon snack tray with chocolates and fruit which we were thoroughly enjoying until another couple let themselves into our room--apparently they were booked into the same room! After that was straightened out, we managed to enjoy the rest of our stay. The hotel has two dogs, which are lent out to hotel guests to walk around town with--lots of fun, and the concierge was very good at getting difficult to come by tables at great restaurants. The pool and gym and locker room facilities were great and very clean. If you are a member of President's Club, you have complimentary Wi-Fi internet access on your own laptop which came in very handy. Our one real problem with our stay is that after we checked out, we were billed a second time for things that were initially taken off our bill at check out. For example, breakfast was included but showed up on our bill. The receptionist took it off, but then we were rebilled for it later on our credit card.

Check in was quite busy in the middle of the afternoon but the line moved quickly. Our travel agent had booked us a twin room despite us requesting a king sized bed and sadly the hotel would not move us from the twin room. They did offer us one of the Club rooms though, at standard advertised price! We declined. Our room was very comfortable and clean. To be honest we spent so little time in it as there is so much to do in and around Vancouver. The hotel has a perfect location, next to the shops and restaurants on Robson Street and just a short walk to the Harbourfront Centre in the opposite direction. We did not eat in the hotel but did have drinks several times also and treated ourselves to the speciality chocolate fondue one evening (an indulgence not to be missed).

It offers enough luxury perks for me in a great downtown location without the much higher costs of newer ultra-luxury hotels closer to the waterfront. The Fairmont room I booked wound up on 13th floor, room number 1303, and was a larger standard room than you'd get a most other hotels as it features a huge king bed, sofa and two comfortable sitting chairs, a work desk with internet hook-up plus a dining table with seating for four. The bathroom was just off the main room entry way and was on the smallish size, which didn't surprise me having stayed at several other vintage \"railway\" hotels in the past. The bonus feature I was surprised to find was the 32-inch flat screen TV on a faux antique set of dersser drawers that housed the mini-bar. When I checked the front desk advised this room is a smoking king Fairmont room, which was the default room type requested I suddenly recalled since I'd forgotten to update my profile with Fairmont's guest loyalty program called President's Club as I'd quit being a smoker within the past 6 months. The clerk was very polite and offered to change rooms and I wanted the king bed and said I'd give it a try and the smell never bothered me. It's the little things I find at Fairmont as the same clerk when I said I'd have to go online when I returned home and update my member profile to change my room preferences said they could do it for me and it would take only a few seconds, which they did. I can't admit to trying all the hotel ammenities as the location lends itself to walking to nearby sights, shopping and restaurants which I did. The location is hard to beat as roughly 4 blocks in any direction puts you at Canada Place where some of the cruise ships dock, the art gallery or downtown shopping with Stanley Park and historic Gastown only another short distance beyond. To each their own and if you are a guest who likes new, chic & hip hotels then this Fairmont may not be for you. However, if you like a historic touch with quiet, elegant luxury then this hotel fits the bill and I can highly recommend it.

When we arrived, there was some momentary confusion while they located my reservation (as a Fairmont President's Club member, this is definitely unusual). However, once we got into the room, it was well-appointed with (a first in my Fairmont experiences) a flat-screen TV instead of the usual 25\" fuzzy tube TV. The bathrom was the smallest of any Fairmont property I've stayed in, but was functional. Our room overlooked Burrard Street, but wasn't high enough up (3rd floor, which seemed to be about the 6th \"real\" floor) to entirely block out traffic noise. The location really can't be beat, with the shopping of Robson Street only 1 1/2 blocks away, and a short walk from most other major downtown routes. The only minor glitch was readily remedied--we had neglected to remove the privacy sign from our door as we headed out for a day of sightseeing; upon returning, we realized housekeeping had (rightfully) not been into the room. We took the privacy sign off the door and laid back for a quick rest, and were going to call housekeeping for an evening refresh when there was a knock on the door. A small army of three housekeepers offered to clean the room in 10 minutes, so we took them up on their offer and stepped out for a quick walk to Pacific Place mall and a smoothie. We returned in 15 minutes, and, true to their word, the housekeeping staff had completely turned over the room...stunning!

The room itself was a bit small but very clean and comfortable, most important to us. The reason I selected the Fairmont was in order to utilize the services of their concierge desk. Their services were extraordinary. They made reservations for us at Cloud 9, a revolving restaurant in order to view the fireworks on our first night. They arranged an entire day for us in Victoria, from rental car, to ferry reservations, to sight- seeing suggestinons. They gave us suggestions and directions to hiking locations.
