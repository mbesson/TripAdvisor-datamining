I made my reservation for the Ocean Front Room with Economy Car deal. First, there are no ocean front rooms... you go out on your balcony, look right, and the ocean is a block away. Second, there was a screwup between the hotel and Dollar Rent A Car (and I may have done something wrong... there wasn't anybody to ask), so I ended up paying twice for my car... once to the hotel and once to Dollar. The person who answers the phone at customer service did not understand (or refused to understand) that there was any problem with that. The hotel is in the heart of Lahaina, a plus. But that means it is noisy until quite late. The rooms are very small, no closet, just two hooks on the wall. The double bed, a big pot plant, and a tall dresser take up most of the space in the room, not even a chair to sit on. The little deck was nice for two people to sit.

A great place! We chose the Lahaina Inn, as it has been recommended several times in the Internet. After having been there, we cannot quite follow such recommendations. We stayed there for 7 nights in the Mauka Suite. The word \"Suite\" is not just what we understand it was: just one normal room with a king-size bed and a balkonee. But ok. When choosing a hotel so centrally placed, one would not complaint about noise from bars around, or drunk people on the street, having fun. The trouble arouse the next morning: at exaktly 5:15 a.m. we were thrown out of the bed by a vulkanoe. It turned out to be the trash removal van, directly under our room. This was repeated every single following day - including Christmas - always between 5:15 and 6:00 a.m. The trash car was reliably followed by many other vans or trucks unloding stuff for the shops and restaurants neighboring Front St. So, at least we were early awake to start our aktivities over the island ... The front desk of the \"Lobby\", only be manned from 8 a.m. To 8 p.m., only very scarcely took note of us, when we were entering or leaving the hotel. A simple \"How wre you?\" was not granted. If you really have a problem - or simply a question - the front desk reverts you to the manager at the \"Royal Lahaina Resort\", 10 miles away, who is doing the management of the Lahaina Inn. After 7 nights, we had to move to the room next door, room #1, because when we made the reservation, the Mauka suite was already reserved over Christmas. Room #1, also facing to the front, towards Lahainaluna St., -and only having sight of a small part of the ocean, if you move your head by 90 degrees - is about half the size of Mauka suite, scarcely twice the size of the queen-size bed. And having the same problems with the noise as described for Mauka suite before. Plus: we have been \"lucky\" to neighboring a female couple in room #2, sitting on the balkonee of their room in the night both after midnight, as well as in the morning as just wakened by the trash removal at 5:15 a.m., and talking so loud, that we could literally understand every single word of their conversation. Internet: Wi-Fi is free one hour (which nobody told us), and then costs 9.95 $/day. Price: for 10 days (7 days Mauka suite and 3 days room #1) we paid over $ 1,800, including a car (economy) and paid parking.

If you can do without hotel and condo amenities, the Lahaina Inn is a very relaxing and atmospheric, even romantic choice. My husband really enjoyed staying here among all the antique decor. The bed was wonderfully comfy, and the common room where you could make your own coffee and a simple breakfast that we brought along for ourselves was a welcome perk. The instructions for checking in after-hours (front desk not staffed after 5pm) were helpful. Best of all, we had a sunny open-air lanai with rocking chairs and an ocean view. A few downsides: * $7 per night for parking -- very affordable by Lahaina standards, but we hadn't known about it in advance. The parking lot has limited space for guests and is a half-block away. * Ample street noise until around 10:30pm. Radios thoughtfully provided in-room to cover up some of that noise, and the air-con added some white noise to the background. * No TVs, wi-fi, etc. (Some might consider this a perk, I realize, but if you have to stay connected to work, it can be an issue.) * Lots of \"rules\" signs everywhere you look in the room. (E.g., \"Check-out time is no later than 11 a.m.\" on the bathroom mirror, instead of somewhere less obtrusive, like the back of the door.) The front desk manager was incredibly cool, and she did everything she could to make everyone's stay as pleasant as possible. The location in the middle of Lahaina town is fun.

We also dined at Lahaina grill adjacent to the hotel which was very convenient. The rooms are clean and well decorated as well as the rest of the Inn. Filled with antiques and history, we spent some time \"reading the walls\" as well as enjoying our view of the harbor/ocean. It is in downtown so sleeping with the windows open is only an option if the noise from the street doesn't bother you. It gives you that \"old west\" feeling.

Let me clarify a few things - the room I stayed in was small. and there was no TV. My bags occupied a lot of space in the room. As this wasn't a traditional hotel I was used to, I wasn't sure I would enjoy it. But I did, very much. I stayed three nights. The room, as I indicated was small, but it was very comfortable. A/C kept the room nice and cool and the bed was great. You're close to everything in Lahaina - restaurants, shops, supermarket, movies, and the beach are all right there. As for the TV, if you really need to watch TV to feel comfortable, there's one in the common room. But seriously, you're in Hawaii, in a great town, right on the edge of the water. Instead of watching TV, I went out and walked around and explored the area. Much better than watching another sitcom re-run. In the later evening, I read, or checked out the internet on the wireless connection, or watched one of the many DVD's I had with me. Seriously, I didn't miss the TV at all. I could keep up with news on my laptop, and watch DVD's or youtube. NBC has whole epsiodes of their shows on the website NBC 24/7. I just don't get the whole freak out about not having a TV to watch. It's sort of a sad commentary. (Then again, try and take my laptop form me...) It was a little loud in the AM with service trucks beeping and clanging, but I was already up - so it's only a problem if you sleep past 9 AM. (You're in Hawaii, why would you?) There's also an iron and ironing board, and beach towels, and radios for use on the beach. The staff was very hospitable - I forgot something when I checked out and less than an hour later I had a phone call telling me so. I also locked myself out, and got great service solving that dilemma. Overall, it was very comfortable, and a GREAT change of pace from an overpriced chain hotel (which I stayed in a week or so prior to my stay here.) I stayed three nights and if I could have, I would rented a room here for a month, It was great, I'm glad to have had the opportunity for the experience. So long story short, if freak out about not having a TV and room service, there are plenty of more expensive options ten miles away.

You'll be given a door code to get in and you'll find an envelope at the front desk with your room key and welcome letter. The two rooms we had during this trip (stayed one night, travelled to other islands and then came back for 3 nights) were cramped but we didn't worry about it too much because they were clean and had charming antique decor. The bonus is the balcony that you get facing the street because of the added space to sit and the view of the water to your right and the mountain to your left. There is a living room type area in the hotel where you can make coffee or sit and watch tv. They have beach mats and a couple other things for guests to use if you're going to the beach. The parking lot is about a block away and the rate just gets charged to your room fee. Downsides: the area is quite noisy from the people coming off Front Street well into the night. There isn't a hotel attendant on site after 5pm so if you need an extra towel or something you're hooped. The lighting in our first room wasn't the greatest, in fact both lamps didn't work so we only had the overhead and hall light. Our one complaint was having the housekeeper not clean our room one morning so we came back in the evening to an unmade room and no towels and had to wait until 8am to get them.

It was an interesting experience but it is definitely not a place for everybody - you will either love it or hate it. For myself, I would have chosen another accommodation option if I were to do it again. I will try to be as objective as possible and here are some pointers: Pros: 1. I think Debbi is friendly and helpful. On the day of check-in she actually tried to carry our luggage to our rooms even though we had 3 guys in our group! 2. I was under the impression that it will have no TV, but I was pleasantly suprised that there was a TV in the community room with all the cable channels you need. They even provide high-speed internet access (you have to bring your own laptop). My group hangs out mostly in the community room, chatting, making tea, watching TV, checking email and looking at photos we took. There are other guests coming into the community room occasionally and they are all very nice and friendly people. I think it is the best part of the whole experience. We stayed in 2 different places after this and I missed the community room. 3. It is in the heart of the Lahaina town, with all the restaurants, shops and galleries you need. We eat and walk around town until 9pm without needing to think about time. You really don't get that if you stay in Kihei. Cons: 1. My friends and my husband both experienced ant problems. My husband found many ants inside his computer bag during our stay and he was very upset. My friend also found ants in her candy that she had in her bag. 2. I loved antiques but I totally forgot about the scent it brings. The inn has a cinnamon-like smell that usually comes from older houses and furniture but personally I am not fond of. My friends didn't seem to have a problem with it though. You should test yourself first by going to a real antique store or an older house and see if you can stand that smell before booking the hotel. 3. I also find the room a bit small and I wish the bed was a bit more comfy. The mattress does feel like it is from the 70s or earlier, which you could say it goes with the theme. I wish they could consider switching to modern day mattress so you can get the modern comfort even though it is fitted in an antique bed frame.", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cNever again!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5329317", "Content": "We have definitely learned our lesson about the word \"cozy\".

We had to carry all of our luggage up the stairs and when we got to our room it was so tiny, I couldn't believe it. The website did indicate cozy but I expected a little more room. We had just enough room to get around the bed in single file due to the large antique furniture although I am pretty sure the bed was a double. The bathroom was really small too with just a shower and nowhere to put out all of our toiletries so we kept almost everything in the suitcases. Also due to the antiques everything smelled really musty to us and the wood floor felt sticky the whole time we were there I am sure because we were near water but it was still an unpleasant feeling so we kept flip flops on any time we got out of bed. The room was not furnished to encourage staying in it because it was so small. I enjoyed being out on the balcony and didn't mind the people on the street. It did remind us of the French Quarter which we like. When I was in the room I was out there because I felt like I could actually breathe, however, we had to be careful going out because the door knob kept falling off and the only comment we got on that was \"Well, it is an antique\". We had requested this specific room based on a review in a travel book saying how romantic it was and how great the view was. We were in Hawaii to renew our wedding vows for our 25th anniversary so we had arranged to stay there for 3 days as opposed to 2 days on Oahu and we paid more per night than the other hotel.
