The room itself was large, the bed was comfortable, there was nice cold A/C, a huge bathroom, and a shower I wish I had in my apt. It was also really clean and we never heard our neighbors. We faced a parking lot and street - we could hear traffic sounds from the bathroom but for some nice reason couldn't in the bedroom area. Negatives - the tv was off to the side even though there was a lot of room in front of the bed. Not a big deal, but a strange set up. One of the creams was curdled so we threw them all out and they were replaced. We were only given 1 tea each day which wasn't replaced our last day. The hotel is really close to the Riverwalk, which I enjoyed. It's also about a 10 minute walk to the heart of the French Quarter. We had breakfast at another hotel's restaurant called Dizzies - really good french toast and decent prices ($7-$10 for breakfast dishes). All in all, I'd stay here again since it was such a comfortable stay. By the way - do NOT take the New Orleans Airport Shuttle to the hotel. We heard a cab ride for 2 people is $33 one way for a 20 minute ride. Instead we spent an HOUR at non rush hour time because every single person was dropped off at a different hotel - everyone except one other couple was a single traveler which meant lots more drop offs. On the way back to the airport, the shuttle was 15-20 minutes late. The doorman said that they're always late. When it finally came there was no one inside. We were first yet they were still late. The security line at the airport was ridiculously long so it was stressful. Do yourself a favor.

I requested a fridge when I made the reservation but because we arrived at 9am rather than 3pm that room was not ready but the guy with the refrigerator was waiting at our new room when we got off the elevator! I am still impressed with that kind of efficiency. It is a short walk to the Quarter and directly across from Harrah's.

The bathroom was rather small in comparison, but the towels were thick and plentiful and the toiletries were good quality. The bed was comfortable and the room was pretty quiet. The lobby was comfortable and quite a popular place for guests to spend time taking advantage of the free wireless (rather than paying the rather exorbitant rates charged for in-room connections or use of the business center computers) and sampling drinks from the adjacent lounge. The concierge, the front desk staff and the bell men were all very friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great location -- within walking distance of the French Quarter, the many good restaurants in the warehouse district and the river walk. The fitness club and spa also was a nice feature. I enjoyed a great massage and a mani/pedi at the Balance Spa the first day we were there -- a great way to begin a vacation! The workout room had a good selection of cardio machines, cybex equipment and free weights. The indoor pool was great for swimming laps, but the lack of windows and rather grungy cushions on the chaises did not encourage lounging. Unlike some of the other hotels, the Loews does not have an outdoor pool or any outdoor seating, so you may want to look elsewhere if hanging out outdoors is important.

I sipped the fresh-squeezed fruit juice - a sweet blend of citrus fruits served ice cold - on offer at the registration desk while I checked in. I took my things up to Room 1806, with two queen beds and a lovely river view. I stayed 3 days and enjoyed the trip immensely. A few highlights: The bathroom switch worked only sporadically and required a call to engineering. On checking in, I found that the luggage rack was broken and needed replacement. Both problems were addressed within 30 minutes of my calling the front desk. My first night, I returned to the room to find a half-bottle of wine and a plate of chocolate truffles on the table by the door. Puzzled, I called down to ask why this lovely gift had been left in my room along with a congratulatory card but the woman at the front desk had no idea. She called back a few minutes later with what she thought was the answer. \"Are you on your honeymoon, sir?\" \"No, I'm here alone.\" \"Is it your anniversary?\" \"It is not.\" \"Your birthday?\" \"Nope.\" \"Hmm. The note here says that you're on your honeymoon.\" \"My wife would be very upset to hear that.\" I offered to return the chocolate truffles and wine. \"Oh, no, sir. Consider it congratulations for choosing Loews.\" Very nice, indeed. Checkout was painless, other than the high price tag. I got my car and was deep into the Garden District for a stop at Whole Foods - they carry gourmet cheeses unavailable in East Texas - when I realized I'd left a pair of sport coats in my room. I called the hotel and, when I got there 15 minutes later, the coats were already waiting. In fact, other than the ridiculous $12.95/day Internet charge for a slow connection, the $29.00/day parking fee, a fickle bathroom light, and a broken luggage rack, Loews impressed me. The staff was uniformly outstanding. There was one other potential hitch: I signed up for their rewards program on my second night, only to learn that my stay at the NOLA wouldn't be credited as the rewards number wasn't attached to my reservation before check-in. So be sure to use your rewards number when making the reservation. When I got a survey the next day, I complained about this and the other minor quibbles. The hotel manager contacted me directly and said he'd credited my stay and promised an upgrade for my next visit. I wrote back asking how to claim the upgrade but haven't yet heard back. Nonetheless, I appreciated his response and was impressed that he took customer feedback seriously. The small problems did nothing to take the shine off the hotel.

Oh, and if you've never been to Capdeville for a lunch that'll knock your socks off--it's just around the corner. A couple of hints: Like a lot of expense-account properties, Loews still hasn't figured out that WiFi should be free. Heck, they've got hard-wired Ethernet in every room, but they still want to charge for basic connectivity? <Sigh.> And there was no convenience store in the lobby area.

There are two W's in New Orleans, so make sure you pick the right one if you want the one located across the street from the Lowes. You can tell a lot about a hotel by the way you are treated after some type of accident or unfortunate incident occurs. We staid here in September of 2011. Fire alarm goes off around 5am over and over. We had arrived very late that night and were looking forward to sleeping in until around 10am. That, of course, did not happen. We only were able to get about 4 hours of sleep. The number one thing you expect from a hotel is that you will be able to get a decent nights sleep. This should be true of even a Holiday Inn or a Lowes. I would not stay here again or recommended them not based on the fact that the alarm went off repeatedly at 5am, but based on how we were treated when we contacted the front desk and manager to complain. As far as we could tell we, nor anyone else staying in the hotel, was given any significant compensation. Only a very insincere apology. I could tell they were just thinking \"we hope these guests leave soon and new ones arrive soon.\" They stuck us with all of the charges on our credit card and sent us on our way.

There was always lots of pedestrian traffic on the streets surrounding the hotel. It's in a happening part of NOLA. The property - A great lobby. It's certainly their crown jewel as it features prominintly on their website and on the complimentary postcards tucked inside the information binder in the rooms. It's also the only location in the building with free Wi-Fi. Otherwise, it's a modern high rise building. Nothing spectacular, but it's not unappealing. Reception/Staff- Service was prompt and friendly. The valets were quick to help unload the bags. Charlotte was the front desk team member who greeted us. She did an excellent job and moved us through the check-in process quickly and with a smile. We didn't use the bellhops since we were travelling light, but they were ready if we needed them. The concierge desk was great. Neil gave us some great advice for restaurants and exploring the western end of the city. Another concierge (sorry, I forgot her name, but I do remember she's from El Salvador) set us up with reservations with Magic Tours for a walking ghost tour on short notice. More about that in my review of Magic Tours (hint - it was a great time). Parking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Valet is available for $29/night ($32.48 after tax). Your car is parked in a garage that's part of the hotel building. I didn't see any other real options. An outside lot nearby was $60/day. Room - Very large for a downtown city hotel. As is the bathroom. Both of which I've found to be pretty much the name of the game at Loews hotels. The bed was comfortable and the TV had plenty of channels. A mini-bar and snacks are available too. There is an in-room safe at the top of the closet. I'm tall, so I didn't mind, but a short person would have trouble accessing it. There's a full sized umbrella in the closet too in case you need it. The bed was very comfortable. No free Wi-Fi in the rooms, just the lobby. Bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Again....huge for a city hotel. It had a large soaking tub (personally, I'd never use a tub in a hotel, no matter how sparkling clean it looks) but it's there if you do. There's a separate glassed shower with plenty of room. Food - We ate breakfast in the on-site restaurant. In general, I'm not a buffet fan, but the on-the-menu items were great. I had an omelet and my wife chose the waffles. I ate all of mine and half of hers. Yummy. The accompanying sides were equally hot and fresh. Value - It's a luxury hotel. Expect to pay for it. \"Value\" and $6.50 cans of M&Ms don't go together in my book, but that's all relative. It's a spacious luxury hotel in a fantastic location with a wonderful staff who make you feel like their job is to serve only you. I think it's worth it. Conclusion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I don't think I'd want to stay any place else in New Orleans. Note to Management: Why can I get complimentary Wi-Fi at McDonald's, Starbuck's, bus stops, highway rest areas, and nearly every chain cookie-cutter $89/night hotel from Bangor to San Diego, but not here? It's even free at truck stops these days. 1998 called.

The pool was indoors, somewhat small, but it was nice and never crowded. There was also a hot tub and sauna. We did use the workout facilities - great selection there. We stayed at the Marriott on Canal about 6 months ago and this hotel is MUCH nicer, but not as close to Bourbon St. We didn't go to Bourbon St. this time since we had the kids. We were a close walk to the convention center, so the husband walked there instead of taking the bus every day. When we arrived at our room, there was jazz music playing. The cd was ours to keep so this was a nice way to take back a little bit of Louisiana with us. We would definitely stay here again. Oh, and this hotel caters to pets but you would never know that.

Here are our observations: Positive: 1. The service at this hotel was impeccable. It could not have been faster, more helpful or more professional in any way. 2. Our room, considered one of their \"grand\" rooms (19th floor), was very spacious, very clean, and extremely quiet. We had a nice view of the Mississippi River. 3. All of the expected amenities for a hotel of this class were provided, including very comfortable bedding, mini-bar, hair dryer, bath supplies, robes, iron and board, etc. All were of very good quality. 4. The bathroom was enormous, with a large tub and separate, very large stall shower. Water pressure and hot water were excellent. 5. The health club was large and provided many exercise machines, a nice lap pool, and extremely reasonably-priced body treatments. The staff were all charming. 6. The location was good. This hotel is situated among many other high-rise hotels in the downtown business district, directly across from Harrah's Casino (which I suggest you avoid). It's midway between the French Quarter (about 5 blocks away) and the Warehouse District (about 3 blocks away). 7. The concierge was extremely helpful, available, and friendly. 8. Room service was fast and is available 24/7. 9. The hotel is very pet-friendly. 10. A complementary copy of the Wall Street Journal was delivered daily. Negative: 1. While our room was very reasonably priced for a hotel of this calibre, many items carried additional high prices. Bottles of water were provided in the room for $6 each. Internet connectivity is $12.95/day (ridiculous!). Parking is $29/day. Minibar charges were similarly high. 2. There was a distinct \"business\" feel to all the public areas of the hotel. It was somehow lacking warmth or charm or openness. There is an outdoor plaza on the side of the hotel, but it's only used for catered affairs. Other than a few tables on the sidewalk of a busy street, there are no outdoor lounges, terraces or courtyards. 3. The food in the restaurant was mediocre at best, with the exception of their desserts (the Biscuit Pudding was superb). Overall, we were quite pleased with the Loew's and would recommend it to those who prefer a high-rise, business-class quality hotel that's well-located.", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNot Impressed\u201d", "Author": "Luckypchw", "ReviewID": "UR62540097", "Content": "Courtesy coffeepot hard to use.

Didn't hear from anyone, so I called again and asked for a supervisor, who I believe was Mike, who told me phone chargers were practically the most left behind item of a guest, and, that the hotel \"had thousands of them\" and he would go look. It would seem to me, that if a hotel is acquiring alot of their guests items and isn't doing much to try to unite the items with their owners, then there is a problem. Why keep them if you have no system to return them? What if whoever turns an lost item in, just attaches a tag with the room number on it. Then it could be returned to the person?

We were pleasantly suprised by the champagne and fruit the staff sent up as a \"welcome & congratulations\" gift. It was much appreciated and really got our stay off to a great start. The room (we had a King on the 16th floor) was huge and overlooked the Mississippi River & Harrahs Casino. The only slight negative didn't have so much to do with the hotel as our next door neighbors; there was a group of 4-5 staying next door who were talking quite loudly after a night out... Not completely unexpected in NOLA, but something to be aware of as the hotel does offer rooms that have doors to adjoin the rooms. We were just about to say something to them as they decided to leave. No biggie but just a minor irritation. The hotel staff was just fantastic. I needed my shoes shined, so I asked for the nearest shoe shine. Instead, the bellman took my shoes to the back, shined them, and returned them to me while I had a cocktail in the Swizzle Stick lounge in the lobby. In addition, we asked the concierge on two separate occassions for recommendations/feedback which she provided (perfectly) and with a smile. Finally, the hotel manager called us on both of our days there to make sure everything was ok and to see if they could do anything to make our stay better. I was always addresed as \"Mr. <lastname>\"... Sometimes I felt like I should have been paying much more for the room. We had breakfast the first morning at the buffet in the Cafe Adelaide restaurant. Though very convenient, we were more pleased with the food quality and service than the price of the buffet.

Because of a late arriving flight, I arrived at the hotel at about 2am. Unfortunately for me, this was the same night as the Saints Monday Night football game. Although I had a reservation (confirmed with a credit card) for a king, non-smoking room, the only room available in the entire hotel was a double-bed, smoking room. When I questioned them about my reservation, they said that because it was after midnight, they had released my room (never mind that they would have billed my credit card for the night had I truly not shown up) and the only other option was to shuttle me over the Sheraton for the night (this was a multi-night stay, which means I would have had to come back to the hotel the next night). Now, in addition to being very late at this point, I had a really bad cold and was clearly having trouble breathing already. Yet, the front desk gentleman told me that the room \"was not that bad.\" I ended up taking the room (and waking up with badly congested lungs), and they were able to change my room the following morning. They also did credit me for 1/2 of that night's stay. I do know that the poor woman who showed up at the hotel behind me was sent over to the Sheraton. My business colleague arrived the next day, and when he went to check in at 6pm (yes 6PM), he was told his room was not ready. After an argument, they upgraded his room to a slightly bigger room. Once settled in the room, I would say it was nice but not spectacular. The room is a nice size. However, the bed was not that comfortable, and no matter what temperature I set the thermostat, it was never warm enough in the room. Also, strange shower -- it was a separate stall from the tub, which I like generally, but the water was uneven. It would be flowing fine and then suddenly the pressure just stopped. And not just a little. A couple of times each morning, the water would slow to a trickle, and then it would sound like a motor restarted and the water would flow again. The restaurant in the hotel is pretty good, as we had breakfast and lunch there. Room service is pretty slow, and inconsistent. Despite specific requests for skim milk, for example, I kept getting cream for my coffee. Overall, as I titled this, once I was in the hotel, it was acceptable but not great. A bunch of little annoyances does detract from the overall experience. However, I will be back to NOLA on business and will likely stay here again as the corporate rate we get is quite good.", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cVery impressed.

When we arrived, the valet opened our doors, and offered to take our bags. They were very prompt in giving us a valet ticket and we went inside to check in. Some of the couples upgraded to a bigger room for like $20. Check-in was quick and easy. Once we got to our room, it was nice and clean. We requested a King bed but got two queens. We had a great view of the river and our room rate was really good so we stayed w/ the two queens. We met the other couples downstairs at the Swizzle Stick Bar, which is known for making a damn strong drink. They won't short you on the vodka!! Anyways, the Seafood Festival was going on a 1/2 block away by Earnst Cafe so we went and ate the Grand Isle restaurant right next to Earnst and then people watched for a little bit outside. The next morning, was when I noticed that the TV was not a very good TV. They should update the TVs to match the rest of the comtemporary room. It was hard to watch some critical football games on that TV. I ordered breakfast from Cafe Adelaide, and it was delivered within 20 minutes. My husband went downstairs and ate from the Cafe Adelaide breakfast buffet for $20 less. For lunch we walked back to the Seafood Festival and tried some of the dishes the local restaurants were serving. You can walk to the quarter if you want, but you will have to cross both Poydras and Canal, which can be a risky walk at night. The hotel is in a great location with the Casino being a block or so away, then there is almost always something going on around Earnst Cafe (a festival or street party of some sort), plus it's an easy walk to Saks. Overall, the hotel was really nice and the staff was very classy. There was even a jazz singer nightly in the lobby. The view of the river from our room (#1901) was perfect! They also allow pets.

I head down to the lobby for coffee which has always been set up on the bar with to go cups..only to find no cups. I ask the desk host at Cafe Adelaide and am told no the coffee is no longer complimentary as they now have cofffee makers in the room. I understand to a degree, but if you are the early riser and try not to wake others coffee is near impossible to make.

It's a nice alternative from the other big chains, and from what I saw of my bachelor party buds who stayed at the Westin, I got a much better deal ($130/night for them). GRIPES- The toilet was running and I had to reattach the chain when I got to my room. Not a big deal, maybe it slid off the last time the maid fixed up the room, but still. The bedspread had some worn spots on the pattern. Maybe damage from an iron, but it makes the room look worn. Fix that, it's cheap to do so. Had to pay for internet, doesn't say how much it is. I skipped it. Fiji water bottle for $6 which I broke down and opened. I know it's Loews but for water, just put a liter of the local bottled stuff in there and charge me $3, please? Does anybody need water shipped in from \"Fiji?\" Aside from not being very green, bottled water is pretty mcuh bottle water. Poland Spring anyone? The breakfast was ho-hum. They're really fake and tense, the host asks you your name when you walk in so that they can call you \"Mr. Whatever\" throughout the whole affair. Maybe some people appreciate that, but it's phony. And this is New Orleans, so chill out. I got Mr. Whatevered so much, I kept turning around to look for my dad. I'm a 32 year old dude. So were you. Yes, I have a nice watch and I have money to stay here, I stay in nice hotels all the time. But you don't need to do that. It's awkward, note that I look like hell and can barely hold a fork. Make me laugh, and please relax, because I'm trying to. I'm having breakfast solo with a head-splitting hangover. It was going to run me $5 for a lousy bowl of cereal, so I opted for an omelette and the buffett, which they blew and turned into a scramble. Not a big deal, but for $20...though they did fill my coffee three times, and the java was good. Bacon was that thick stuff, too, yum. The big glass of fresh-squeezed OJ was heavenly, and actually quite cheap at $2. It was all good, I guess, but they need to relax and be themselves. Its weird. POSITIVES - High cielings, and room was very cool, despite being top-floor. Shades easy to close completely for when you roll into bed at 7:30 AM. Kuerig Cup coffee maker with and lots of K-Cups of the caffeinated stuff....and mimi-moos, ....not the powdered coffee creamer either. Jackpot. Powerful water pressure in shower - and again on the top floor. Elevators pretty quick. TV was old-school projection, not a flat-screen, but as a frequent-traveler for business and work, this is actually a GOOD thing. If you've ever tried to flip through channels with the new flat-screens at the Marriotts or Westins, it's impossible. There's no channel guide like at home, you wind up hitting 15 ESPNs analog then digital and it takes 30 seconds to go form channel to channel. It's miserable. Kudos to them on waiting until they perfect that technology. I need to just find HBO and CNN, and one ESPN. I don't need 500 channels that will take me 20 minutes to find. I can live with non-HD for one day. Gym was nice and big with lots of equipment - spa looked decent as well. Smoking-hot girls working there. The elliptical were the funny cybex ones, not the precors. But they had TV audio hooked up to them, pretty impressive. I pondered a message, but opted not too for lack of time.

On the positive side, I think that the staff are well used to complaints about housekeeping - I think the management do not have any intentions of insisting housekeeping staff improve as the latter are probably paid \"peanuts\" and it is clearly considered more cost effective to retain lazy staff and compensate guests who make a complaint! Hence we had free drinks, free meals, bathrobes to take home and a whole plethora of goodies! I would suggest that rather than \"putting up\" with the inconveniences of not having coffee replenished etc that guests do bring this to the management's attention. I think only when half the guests are having to have hundreds of dollars of credit at the bar and restaurant will the low standards of housekeeping be addressed on a more permanent basis.

They were not at all helpful even though we were left with nowhere to stay. I contacted Loews and got a room for 4 nights.

We arrived at Loews about 3 p.m. to a skeleton staff of employees who were either back in the city after the evacuation or had not left. There was still a curfew in effect and very little open the first couple of nights that we were there, but Loews more than made up for any inconvenience. They put out a great (and very reasonable priced) buffet on Thursday night with what they had available since there had not been any deliveries in a few days.

We were here on a weekend so we parked on the street for free, so I have no comment on the hotel's parking situation. The front desk staff was great and upgraded us to a nicer room on the executive floor. We had a fantastic view of the city and Mississippi River. This room was like the perfect hotel room: oversized, clean, modern and well-appointed. I loved the large entry area. It provides extra space for things and had a nice long table along the wall with a shelf underneath. The king size bed was extremely comfortable and had very comfy pillows too. There was a sitting area with couch and coffee table as well as a very large desk and chair. The TV, which sat on top of a hutch with drawers, swiveled so you could view it if you were in bed or sitting on the couch. However, unless you propped something behind the TV, it would swivel back around. (The hotel menu book came in handy for something. LOL!) The bathroom was average-size but stylish and had some nice toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, body wash, sewing kit and q-tips, but no shower cap) and a high-wattage blow dryer. The towels were plentiful and plush and included two oversized bath sheets. Nice! Outside the bathroom was additional counter space on which was an Ipod port & speakers, and underneath that on pull-out shelves was a coffee maker & fixin's (Emeril's coffee, decaf, green tea and black tea), ice bucket and glasses. Across from that was an ample-sized closet with an iron and ironing board and a pair of robes. We don't know if anyone was staying next to us, but we never heard any noise. We enjoyed the New Orleans Picayne newspaper that was left outside our door each morning. We did not make use of the pool, workout room or restaurants so I have no comment on them. The downstairs lobby area was small but very elegant. I noticed they're pet-friendly as when we were leaving I noticed a couple checking in with 2 dogs. I suppose that can be either a positive or negative, depending on how you look at it. I thought the location was perfect: close enough to the French Quarter to walk there, but just far enough away to be quiet. Really perfect location for us. Across the street in one direction is Harrah's Casino and in another direction is Mother's Restaurant. (Mother's may not be what it once was, but you can't go wrong if you order what we did for an early dinner: Mother's famous ham poboys and for dessert, bread pudding!)

The layout was very conducive to just moving around without feeling cramped or restricted in any way. The bathroom was also well-lit, nicely stocked with plush towels and very spacious. We did not try any of the hotel restaurants/bars, but Loews is conveniently located across the street from one of the most well-known establishments in New Orleans - Mother's Restaurant - get there early for their fabulous breakfast. Another plus (for us) was being a bit outside of the French Quarter. Nothing is worse than the loud, obnoxious crowds at night, so the Loews was a nice retreat from that. Harrah's Hotel & Casino is also close-by as is Windsor Court Hotel (their afternoon tea is wonderful). We only stayed one night at Loews, so perhaps we didn't see (negative) things that we might have seen had we stayed longer.

For instance, they provide you with a tea/coffee maker, but that's not much good when the maid forgtets to replenish the creams. We used all our shampoo and the next day it was not replenished. Instead we had two conditioners left for us. (Maybe we just got unlucky with this maid - I don't know) On the Sunday we decided to treat ourseleves to a nice big breakfast in the hotel. We went down at 9:50am. We were told that due to it being Mothers Day they weren't seating for breakfast anymore! On a Sunday! I was furious. Mostly because I would have expected something like that to be communicated to the hotel guests in advance. There was no offer to allow us breakfast in the room instead or anything along those lines. Then on the last day when checking out they tried to bill me $2.92 for something I'd supposedly had from the minibar. I refused to pay it, and they didn't cause a fuss, but it was yet another example of the service not being 100% at this hotel. The other thing I disliked was the pool. It's not a leisure pool.

As a regular to New Orleans and a former resident, I am very familiar with the hotels and what one should expect, even in a post-Katrina world. I was worried about the mixed reviews that I read before I left for the trip, but all my fears were removed as soon as our cab pulled up to the property and we were literally fawned over by the bell staff and the desk staff. One bell person gave my 2 year old son a magna doodle while we checked in. Apparently, they have toys in the back to give out to kids. So, overall, already I could see this would be a very kid-friendly hotel. Since I am a Loews frequent guest member, I was upgraded to a Deluxe Luxury King on the top floor (21st - room 2119). The bell person let my son ride the luggage cart to the room. My son was happy, so I was happy. The view from the top floor was great. While not a river view, I'm still from the days when there were few tall buildings that one had access to in NOLA and the view towards the lake and Metairie still fascinates me. Our room was HUGE and spotless. It was as big as many \"suites\" these days, the only thing missing was a dividing wall. There were even TWO tvs! Which I thought was a little overkill but in the end it worked out when there was a big thunderstorm one afternoon and we were stuck in the room and my husband wanted to watch something different from what I was watching. The bathroom - immaculate and well-stocked. One of the best features - there were bath sheets in addition to bath towels! That's a big plus for my husband who is a big guy and usually the bath towels don't fit around him. If I hadn't been travelling with my son, the bath (without shower) being separate from the shower stall might have annoyed me, but it was nice to have a big tub without a shower curtain when it came time to bathe my son. The sheer size of the bathroom was a big plus. My husband and I agreed that the bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds we've ever slept in. As I was also in town on business, we had the pleasure of a business dinner in a private room in the hotel's restaurant Cafe Adelaide. I can't say enough about how wonderful the food was and how attentive the staff was. The only annoying aspect was that we had the Turtle Room furthest in back. There's another \"library\" room in front of our room that was booked the same night, and we had to walk through that room to get to the bathroom. We also used the Swizzle Stick Bar one day when my son insisted on eating a hamburger but Cafe Adelaide was closed for turnover to dinner. The waiter was more than pleasant to my son and highly attentive. Overall I have to say I only had amazing encounters with the staff. They were all pleasant, happy, and ready to help in any way possible. The hotel is very close to the French Quarter - it's only about 2 blocks to Canal Street from Poydras. The only downside was that bell service at the front door was hit or miss. On Saturday morning at 8:30AM, I needed a cab to get to a meeting. It would have been helpful if the bell person was there to whistle for the sleeping driver rather than my having to walk over to the driver and tap on the window. One time we had to open the doors to the hotel ourselves, other times, there were 3 guys running to open the doors for us.

Overall we really enjoyed our stay but I don't feel I can give the hotel 5 stars due to a number of problems with their Housekeeping Dept. Before I go into that , briefly here are the highlights: - Beautifully maintained and very stylish hotel - Front Desk staff were professional, courteous and efficient - Complimentary coffee for guests each morning - Complimentary Paper for guests each morning - Rooms were nicely decorated with pleasant toiletries - Hotel was VERY dog-friendly which was important to us as we brought our dog with us. The problem w/ their Housekeeping is that they refused to make up our room although they were busily vacuuming outside our door at 7:30 am. Anyways, we left our room around 10 am, put the sign on the door to make up the room and took our dog w/ us so that the maids could clean w/o the dog being there. We got back around 1:30 pm and our room had not been cleaned. This was a little annoying as we had hoped to leave the dog there in the afternoon so we could shop without her. I phoned downstairs and requested that our room be cleaned. They said they had \"until 4 pm to clean\" it but would send someone right away to service the room. We left (and took the dog) and returned at 5:30pm and our room still had not been cleaned!! I then spoke with the Manager who offered to put us in a suite 2 doors down. Which was nice and all but there was the hassle of moving everything (including the dog's blanket, toys, food, etc...). To the hotel's further credit, they offered to waive the 2 days of valet parking as a way to make up for the lack of housekeeping. Which, was very nice of them and much appreciated. Also, 4 days later I noticed an extra charge on my Amex for mini-bar charges for food/drink we did not consume since we did not have a mini-bar key! I imagine Housekeeping had a hand in that error as well. All in all, it was a great hotel and very dog-friendly and I would probably go back.

Small hall area and small storage area on way to bath room help to qualify room as a \"suite.\" Our \"suite\" on the 17th floor had a view of the Mississippi River. Hotel is adjacent to Harrah's Casino and about 5 blocks to the heart of the French Quarter. The restaurant in the hotel is another of the Brennan family of restaurants. This is a small, vertical hotel, everything with my meeting occurred on floors 8-10. Thank goodness the elevators move very fast given the amount of traffic. Meeting rooms were very nice, well appointed and food was very good, even satisfied my foodie wife. Staff was very helpful with suggestions for places to go and how to get there. While I was in meeting, wife used the gym--although small, had windows, TV and the usual gym equipment. Spa on site with lap pool, neither of us used it. Free coffee in lobby and you get free newspaper each morning. Internet in rooms is wired and has a use fee, anything printed requires trip to business center. Bar was very popular. Negatives--turndown service--you have to call for it. If you wanted any little items like magazines, there is no little shop in the hotel, kind of surprising for a hotel. I don't think that I have ever been in a hotel without a sundry-souvenir shop. Bathroom amenities were not as plentiful or as nice as other hotels in this class. My wife noticed the lack of a shower cap and lack of hair dryer in room, although I thought if you really needed it, they would probably provide you with one. Also if you wanted boarding passes printed, you need to go to the one and only concierge--who was getting slammed Saturday afternoon after our meeting, as everyone was waiting to get their boarding pass at the same time. We all felt sorry for her, she suggested that we write a comment to the management about this situation. Same thing happened with bell captain when we wanted to get our bags to leave--kind of overwhelmed with the rush. Overall a pleasant, but not totally satisfying experience.

Overall, the hotel was good, but I did run into one problem during my stay. Although the person that checked me in was very nice, I found that througout the rest of my stay, the front desk staff and concierge to be less than friendly, and one staff member that was completely disinterested. This was odd, because everyone else I met on the streets, at the convention center and at the restaurants were so welcoming and friendly. I would've expected a friendlier staff in the hotel. I was given a room on the top floor (21st). The room was very spacious and clean. Great view. Desk was large enough to work on (for business travellers), and the in-room Internet connection was good. Free wireless is available in the lobby too. The bathroom was also a good size with full bath and separate shower, and the towels were probably the softest I've ever used at a hotel. I encountered one major problem - the phone. The phone had a problem with calling a double-line. That is, if I called someone using a number, the phone would call the number a second time on the second line which caused much confusion when I tried using room service and front desk. It took two hours for someone to come up look at it to tell me that it would take 24hr for a 3rd party to come in to fix it. I suppose I was just unlucky with this event. Like most hotels, room-service food was horrible. On the other hand, the hotel restaurant, Cafe Adelaide was fantastic. Probably one of the best meals in New Orleans. The service is spectacular. The restaurant belongs to the Commander's Palace Group. Location was central. Harrah's is located across the street, and the Canal Shopping Centre and Riverwalk Centre were both 2 blocks away. The Morial Convention Center was about 6 blocks away, but if your conference is on the far side... it's like walking an extra 6-8 blocks. The French Quarter is technically 2 blocks away, and the start of Bourbon Street was around 6 blocks away. Overall, it's central, but neither particularly close to the convention center or French Quarter. As a business traveller, this was OK, but a tourist may want a hotel closer to the French Quarter. This hotel location was near the end point of the several of the pre-Mardi Gras parades, which was a nice surprise. Overall, the hotel is good.

Truly everything about this hotel was first-class -- it was one of my best hotel stays in 20+ years of travel. The Loews New Orleans is very stylish and to a person everyone there was friendly and helpful. The check-in was smooth (even with my discounted Travelocity room rate of $104), and with my high floor request I received the top floor of the hotel. In four days I rode express to the 21st floor on the elevators with no stops or waiting most of the trips. My room was large, clean, comfortable, quiet, and very well air-conditioned. There was a great view of the river, bridge, and city. The bed was superb. In my closet I found an umbrella to use during my stay. It was much bigger than the one I brought so I ended up using it most days. The elegant bathroom had granite (?) countertops and enough towels for four people. Every day my room was cleaned beautifully. The housekeeping staff were polite when knocking, and understanding when asked to come back. One day they even left a small fabric mat under my toothbrush. In a rush, I'd forgotten my toothpaste and sheepishly asked for help at the desk -- and promptly received a small tube, no charge. The concierge(s) helped me find a shoe repair shop and checked diligently for an open seat on the airport shuttle bus. Finally, the doormen at the Loews New Orleans were simply the best -- even while working in the extreme heat or rain. I watched one doorman get soaked in rainstorm as he held his umbrella over a guest as she made her way from the cab to the door. Another doorman helped me understand the best/driest walking routes to the convention center. The only small mistake made during my entire stay was fixed promptly and with an apology (an incorrect room charge). The location works well for a conference in the convention center (about 3-4 blocks) yet it is still close to the French Quarter (about 6-8 blocks). The pool and gym looked great but I didn't use them. Also did not use parking or the restaurant. The entire staff at the Loews is very service-oriented, friendly, and polite. They made it clear that New Orleans is indeed open for business.

It was not one of the conference hotels, but from what I hear from fellow conference attendees, I think it was the best deal in town. The rooms were a good size (the bed and pillows were so comfortable!), the bathrooms were modern and well-appointed, 2 bathrobes were provided, nice fitness area and lap pool (2 lanes), plus a wonderful lounge space on the main lobby floor. The staff was attentive and helpful. The hotel is 2 blocks from Harrah's Casino and a short walk to the French Quarter. The Hilton is 2 blocks away (many of our conference events were held there) and the convention center is about 5-6 blocks away. Mother's, a popular breakfast establishment, is 1 block away. Emeril's restaurant (where we had a completely fabulous meal) is about 3-4 blocks away on Tchoupitoulas. The lovely modern lounge area provides a relaxing space. Wifi is free throughout the ground floor lobby area, but $12.95 in the rooms (seems excessive). Staff were exceedingly pleasant and helpful. I loved the bath products provided. For those traveling with pets, the hotel is pet-friendly. I shared an elevator with 2 chihuahuas. I paid the gov't rate of $102/night + taxes, which came to about $118/night. At the time, they were offering a \"buy 3 nights, get the 4th free\" rate that was comparable. Friends booked into suites on the 18th floor that were not much more expensive and offered additional space. I wish I had discovered the lever that adjusted the water pressure earlier on - I took a few very low-pressure showers before I noticed it adjusted. The housekeeping staff removed the bar soap each day and replaced with fresh soap, which seemed a bit unnecessary to me and a giant waste of soap. In the bar, the Bloody Marys weren't very good (too much spice and too many extraneous vegetables - string beans?!?), but the waiter apologized and offered to remove the drinks from the receipt. He was very attentive to our needs and conveyed how much the staff love working at the Loews. It definitely shows. I will look for a Loews again in my future travels. PS As a side note, for those who may be hesitant of visiting New Orleans post-Katrina, the convention center area and the French Quarter area were not as affected and don't really appear any different to the average tourist. Further out, there is still significant damage. We took a brief tour of the Lower 9th Ward that was sobering. That said, the local people are SO HAPPY to have visitors in their city and thrilled to welcome you. Everyone - the cab drivers, the shop owners, the bartenders, etc. - will tell you how happy they are to see you and thank you profusely for keeping their city alive. It's definitely worth a visit. If you do, check out the wonderful NOLA Habitat for Humanity.

My coworker was completely jealous when she came over to the lobby of the Loews to meet me one night! I stayed in a luxury suite for only $125 a night and it was well worth it, huge bed, very clean and the staff very helpful. I also ate breakfast two mornings at the Adelaide, Swizzle Stick Bar and Cafe downstairs in the lobby and it was fantastic! I wish I had discovered the Cafe earlier in the week because I surely would have gone each morning for breakfast. I also used the gym which was nice and a small indoor pool. It is right next door to the Casino and the W hotel which has a nice bar in it. It is a short walk from Canal Street and the upscale store areas, and then you're in the French Quarter. For places to eat, try Mother's across the street from the hotel, if you're adventurous and feel like biscuits, ham and grits - true N'Awlins cooking. I also had very good lunches, not expensive at the cute little La Boucherie Coffee House on Chartres street , and the Red Fish Grille closer to Bourbon.

A little bit of an unpleasant surprise if you enjoy lounging late in bed on a beautiful Sunday. My guess it's because of the lack of available workers due to Katrina. Overall I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "January 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "miami", "Title": "\u201cComfortable stay in Crescent City.\u201d", "Author": "juanlb", "ReviewID": "UR3798075", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at this hotel from August 7th through the 11th of 2005. The hotel is well located, specially if attending a convention (Morial center is about 5 blocks away, easily walked) but equally convenient to the french quarter and streetcar lines to the garden district. The hotel is pretty drab from the exterior, but doesn't disappoint once you step inside. It has a very nice lobby with beautiful stained glass panels, and the adjacent Swizzle Stick bar is comfortable, cozy and hip. Our room had a nice view, the decoration was ok, but nothing extraordinary. The room was generally well-equipped with 2 phone lines and 2 phones (one cordless), coffee maker, hair dryer, high speed DSL (at no addtional cost) and a big desk and reading chair. The mattress, pillows and linens were great, along with the toiletries. The hotel has a small but relaxing indoor pool and a well-equipped gym. The concierge was very helpful in providing tourist info, maps and the sort. Overall service was above average. Considering the rate I paid (around $130 per night with taxes included) I don't think we could've done better. The only thing that wasn't satisfactory was the cost of valet service which at $28 per day seems excessive. Definitely recommended.", "Date": "August 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mobile, AL", "Title": "\u201cGood lodging accomodations, subpar service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3699613", "Content": "The hotel's accomodations were very good. The beds were very comfortable and the room was nicely decorated. However, for the level of hotel that it is, the service left much to be desired. The bartender was rude and neither the manager nor the concierge responded with anything above an apology. We had reservations three weeks in advance but our room category was unavailable at check-in. They upgraded us, but failed to communicate this with us and we had to call down to find out that we had been upgraded. We did not receive our Loews First welcome amenity. While my accommodations were nice, I feel what sets hotels of this class apart is service. So if service is what you crave, try the Ritz or the Sheraton instead.", "Date": "July 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, New York", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3698901", "Content": "The Loews of New Orleans certainly misrepresented itself to me. I booked two rooms at the top rate. I made sure to join the Loews First club in advance of this costly stay. I anticipated earning points towards another stay within their chain,or with one of their business partners. However, here I am several months later, ready to collect and I am told- no deal! They did not credit either of our rooms and all the expensive food we ate, due to the fact that we booked our stay through the convention tourist agency! What a rip off!! None of this information was offered to me when I set up the membership! No other chain has such a policy! As for the hotel-the location is good but the hotel it is average in every way.
