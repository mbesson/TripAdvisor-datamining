The bed must have been 40 years old too! . I immediately tried to find another hotel but everything else was full so I stayed. Outside the noise from the main road and the local drunks was incessant all night. I slept on top of the bed with my clothes on and eventually got a few hours sleep. Reception staff were OK and towels/white sheets and bathroom were cleanish but that was about it. Room was tiny and bedside lamp had live wires visible. Internet didn't work in the room - only in reception. This hotel is the kind of place that gives London a bad name.

The only things I would criticise were that the TV remote didn't work and the curtains didn't close properly, but these are very minor quibbles.

The hotel itself is ideal for anyone with a strict budget who just needs a base to operate from. It's really close to Kings Cross/St Pancras station which is a blessing if you've got a long day of travel ahead of you. True the hotel itself does look grubby from the outside but they have tried their best to keep the inside looking presentable and clean. It's shockingly tricky to do this in high traffic central London! The staff were helpful and pleasant enough. They checked me in promptly and ordered me a taxi when I asked for one later without any attitude. No issues with me turning up after 2am from a night of clubbing either. If you want the fake, sugar-sweet, over friendly reception you get at some hotels, feel free to pay through the nose for this and stay elsewhere. The lift is a bit prehistoric but it works. My room was fair sized and was decorated to a basic but modern standard. It was freshly hoovered, had clean sheets on the bed and telly & kettle worked. No issues with noise despite my room being on the same side as a 'main' road and being in the room directly opposite the lift. Despite the horror stories there was no hint of flea infestations, I checked!! The bathroom was clean but probably could do with a slight tweak here and there, however I feel they made the most of the space they had - toilet, sink and shower all worked fine and I didn't have any issues regarding there being no hot water of a morning... granted you do have to let the shower run for a little while before it gets to optimum temperature. The bottom line is that I've stayed in more expensive hotels where the standard has been *lower* than here in every respect. Continental breakfast is served right up until 10am, which is good if you prefer to sleep in slightly later. I cannot comment on the standard or quality of the food because I was running super late and it was more important that I caught my train than staying around to find out what the food was like! If you want more than than a basic place to lay your head, simply pay for a more expensive hotel. I would not have paid \u00c2\u00a380 for a double here though - if you do then you're getting ripped off and WILL be let down by the hotel.

My first impressions were daunted when we entered Swinton Street itself which looked jaded, dirty and neglected. We reached the outside of the hotel and were not encouraged or heartened by the scrappy paintwork and dusty curtains and we reluctantly entered the building to find nothing short of a hovel. We refused use of the lift and accepted the challenge of 3 flights of stairs. We were less intimidated by the garish pattern of the carpet than we were of the stains it failed to hide. We were also very cautious not to touch the filthy paintwork, which took a degree of skill considering the amount of luggage we had. The room contained a bed which boasted a surprisingly clean set of sheets. Other than that we were again predictably disappointed. Everything just looked and felt grubby. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m getting flashbacks as I type of the rust encrusted toilet roll holder, the curtains which had black filth along the rims and the shower that was too small to actually shower in. To be honest, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting too much for our \u00c2\u00a380 - somewhere clean to change and to wash and to rest and to set us up with a hearty breakfast on our departure for our journey in the morning. The hotel failed to fulfil any of these requirements.

Deprived of our basic morning ablutions we then braved the dining area for breakfast. By this time we had discarded hope and expected the worse. We were placed on a table next to what looked like an old washing mangle which was being used as a dumping area for the staffs bags and coats.
