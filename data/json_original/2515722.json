I asked for two queens instead of the king suite reserved through Hotwire, and for some reason we were given a handicapped room, which was actually a bit cramped (you might expect it to be more spacious) - the furniture was too big for the width of the room (I don't think a wheelchair could pass between the beds and TV console and closet) and we didn't have a bathtub, which was disappointing with a small child. It was late enough we didn't bother to ask to switch. I was disappointed that they charged $8 for parking in an open lot in a non-downtown location. I booked on Hotwire and have written to them suggesting they mention \"fee for parking\" since more hotels that never charged before are starting to charge for parking. The jacuzzi was nice and the whole pool area is quite attractive, full of foliage in an interior courtyard surrounded by the rooms. Unfortunately my husband and I were eaten alive by mosquitoes at the jacuzzi (around 9:30PM at night) - management should look into spraying, perhaps after the pool closes. The breakfast area is very large and there is an attractive patio with tables to sit outside (same area as the pool mentioned above.)

Well, I can't say enough about my stay here. I have been staying at ths Comfort Suites M-F for business for almost a year now. I have seen a tremendous transformation during this time from renevation, to services, to staff. And it has all been very positive. The front desk staff are always personable and eager to help. Sarica, Ashley, Divina always have a smile to share. Adam and Frederick are who I see at night after a day of business. They don't just hello in a passing fashion. They ask you how you are and how your day was. And even more important, they listen to your answers and boring stoires. Not an easy thing to do at 11:30 at night! The breakfast buffet has improved ten fold. I apologize for not knowing the lovely woman's name who has taken over this task, but she is doing a wonderful job. She's always helping guests and asking if everything is good for them. She works at such a frantic pace keeping coffee and juice plentiful, and keeping the buffet clean amongst the constant spills from us guests. And she always smiles. The housekeeping staff probably have the most thankless job of all. Well a warm hearted thank you to all of them. Everytime you pass them in the hallways they won't look away, or not look at you at all, they will say hello, and if the occassion arises, they will ask you if you have evrything you need. How nice. And the maitenance guys always give a wave hello...when their hands aren't full! The renevation of the hotel increased the visual appeal as well. And the rooms with new carpets, flat screen TV's, and wall paper, and wireless internet has made my stays even more enjoyable. The center point to all this improvement can be contributed to Elizabeth Ming, the manager. I have seen her involved at every stage of transformation this hotel has gone through in the past year. From the gardens, to the renovation of the building, to staff changes, she has been completely involved with every aspect of the hotels improvement. One thing that is small in the whole scheme of things, but in my opinion shows a great managerial decision, is the change in the parking permits that you hang from your car mirror. When I first started staying here, the permits were multicolored and glossy. Pretty to look at, but at what cost just to hang on your mirror. Well eventually, in a smart cost cutting decision (again in my opinion) was changing these placards to plain white with black print. That is looking out for the best interest of the hotel, and the guests. Great job! I want to thank each and every one for making my stay away from home, feel like home. You have my gratitude.

Lastly, I had chosen another hotel that claimed it was much closer to Seaworld, and after a miserable night, that is how I ended up here. The lesson is, don't let distance be your deciding factor, turns out a lot of the area close to Seaworld is VERY shady (strip clubs, night walkers, adult shops everywhere), and this area didn't seem to suffer from that and because of the freeway, you get to the park extremely quickly anyways.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cworst front desk service you could ever imagine. total madness.\u201d", "Author": "layla89james", "ReviewID": "UR114847180", "Content": "I read the previous reviews and they were all correct....the desk clerks and managers were horrendous.

Our stay started out badly when I got into the room and we found someone's leftovers in the mini-fridge. Then I looked in the bathroom and there was blood and hair on the floor. I think the maid that folds the towels has long dark hair because every day we got new towels there was more long black hair in them. She should wear a hairnet. The TV's were indeed fuzzy. One of our rooms didn't have a remote but maintainance brought one when we called. The other rooms TVs could not get movies on it and half the channels didn't work. Most of the channels are shopping channels and local networks anyway; I don't know why they even have cable. The bathroom door would not shut and they never did fix that for us. They never had enough pool towels. The room towels were often stained and they never had enough for us. The doors are not sealed well. Lots of light and noise from outside comes in. Don't get a room by pool or ice machine. The breakfast is good but they only have limited quantities at a time and one person working the breakfast area. They are always out of warm food and coffee, never enough muffins & bagels & condiments and no one to keep spills off the floor or wipe the tables. You're not supposed to take food out of the breakfast area, but if it's a cold day there are not enough indoor tables. And what's with paying extra for parking?! That should be included in the room charge. The parking stalls are too close together and there weren't enough of them if you came in late at night. Then, some of them were blocked off by the painters. We would have left to another hotel but the hotel wouldn't refund us because we had pre-paid.

The location was OK - close to the airport, Sea World, SD Zoo, and the beach. There's also a shopping mall reallly close by, along with several restaurants.

I originally picked this place over other comparable facilities is becaues of their advertised waffle bar breakfast. Their normal breakfast consist of toast, bagels, pastries, cereal, milk, OJ, cranberry juice, coffee/tea. On Sunday they add eggs and sausage patties. 2. The pillows and mattress were REALLY uncomfortable. My husband descrived the pillows as bags of giant cotton balls. For the king size bed, instead of the normal 2 king-sized pillows,they give you 5 square throw pillows. 3. The TV cable to the kids' room cuts in and out. We had to fiddle around with the cable to get a somewhat clear reception. 4. The front desk clerk was RUDE. She didn't even know their own Sea World fun pass promotion when I asked her and told us to call Sea World ourselves...umm, it's a special that's advertise on your website, hello!!! 5. The toilet did not flush properly. We had to hold the lever down for the toilet to do a complete enough flush. 6. The shower head was really sub-par. The water pressure was horrible, though the water stayed hot while all 5 of us showered or bathed. 7. The water in the pool was somewhat cloudy. My husband attributed this to the fact that everyone was probably wearing sunscreen, but I think it's just gross. 8. They charged for parking. 9. The wall/door did not cut the noise out.

Our daughter's side was nice and cool (where the A/C unit was) and our side was a bit stuffy. Thankfully, we packed a small fan! I also took another guest's advice and packed some lavendar linen spray, as the hotel did have a \"smell\" (damp/urine smell). It was very obvious the first day, but it seemed to be better as the days went on. Overall, this hotel served it's purpose. We were only in the room for our daughter's naptime and to sleep at night. Thankfully, we did not have a pool view room, because it would have been very noisy. There were big kids in the pool until 10 (maybe even later) each night and they were quite loud. The bed and bed linens were very comfy and it was wonderful to see plenty of pillows and soft, clean towels available! The breakfast was ok.

I originally researched hotels in the San Diego area long before our trip. This hotel had positive reviews, and the kids\u2019 separate room was a humongous bonus, it seemed. My 4-year-old could sleep on the bottom bunk, and his 2-year-old sister in a pack-n-play in the same room, while we (my husband and I) slept in the master bedroom. I don\u2019t think I did my research well enough! While the price was doable (about $179/night), the room itself was awful. When I first walked in I immediately noticed how tiny the room was. I opened the main door, which immediately puts you into the \u201cmaster\u201d bedroom. The bed took up practically the entire space. There was also an armoire with a tv on top, a mini-fridge, and I think a tiny microwave. There was practically no counter space to set things down, no place to set our suitcases without unpacking everything into drawers. Looking from the door, I could see through the \u201cmaster\u201d bedroom, into the kids\u2019 room, into the bathroom. You\u2019d have to go through the kids\u2019 room to get to the single bathroom. Not so handy while kids are trying to go to sleep, or if you needed to get up before them. The door wall separating the kids\u2019 room and our room was a joke. The curtains didn\u2019t block out any light, so we had to sit with all the lights off and tv off while the kids fell asleep. The room itself was grungy and dirty, an overall icky feeling. I admit I can be picky about hotels, so I didn\u2019t say anything to my husband. But when he said to me, \u201clet\u2019s see what else we can find tomorrow\u201d I knew there was a problem. He is not picky. We ended up switching to the (more expensive by $20 a night) Residence Inn, which was AMAZING. Totally worth it for the week we were in San Diego. Full kitchen, 2 floors, separate room upstairs for adults (and full bath), along with separate room downstairs with blackout curtains on door wall, and another full bath on first floor. Living room with tv and couch, granite countertops in kitchen. The only problem was the steep staircase \u2013 my 2-year-old needed to be watched while ascending and descending.

We drove to the area where our room was, and contrary to the review below (staying one of the same nights as us), this hotel is not in a bad neighborhood, nor did I feel like I was going to be jumped going from the car to the room. I actually saw more that one security guard on the lot. To get into the hotel, you must use your room key, and you can actually enter from the lobby if that makes you feel more secure. Yes there are trash cans located outside each corridor entrance with sand for cigarette butts, but in the 5 days we were there, they seemed to be kept clean. As there is no smoking in the hotel nor in most of the state of California, these types of trash cans are common pretty much in every city/hotel/restaurant that I have ever been to. While staying here, I did notice that there are several layouts to these rooms. Some with the pull out bed first, some with the bathroom in the back. When you entered our room, the bathroom was immediately to your right, the main bed next, and the extra room/pull out bed behind a sliding door. The A/C is located in this room w/a fan between to pull the air in. The A/C was not noisy, it was very efficient and the fan was fine.

The prior reviews were accurate, but that does not necessarily mean you should not stay here. 1)Parking-As opposed to other hotels in San Diego, parking here is free. The spots surrounded the building, there were quite a number of spots, but still I wonder if one would get shut out if one arrived real late at night. We got back late a few times, did find a spot, but we had to back in , as the spots were tight. If you are a good driver, are adept at backing into a spot, then you will be OK. So, parking is free which is a positive. 2)The breakfast is typical Choice Hotel breakfast, cereals, bread, danishes, juices, coffee and this hotel even had hard boiled eggs too. Aside from the indoor breakfast room, there was an outdoor eating area also. We were earlybirds, so we were able to get an outside table each morning. I don't know why anybody would knock the breakfast at this hotel, it was fine. 3)Location- This hotel was one of many hotels that were near each other. A reference to the AAA Tour Book spotting map will show that there are many hotels in the vicinity. I found the location of this hotel outstanding. It is actually on the service road of one of the freeways. This hotel is centrally located as it is near 3 freeways concurrently. We went to : Wild Animal Park SD Zoo Seaworld Balboa Park Museums SD Airport The Wild Animal Park is a bit of a ride North, but the other places and Airport are minutes from the hotel. In addition, we were not real far from downtown, and visited the shops along the harbor. The entrance to the freeway was just a few blocks from the hotel, what more could you ask for? 4)Movie charge: I just reread one of the reviews before I wrote this, and was incredulous that I had the same thing happen to me. The night before we left, I channel surfed for a few minutes while my wife was packing the luggage. When I got the bill the next morning, there was a charge for a movie. I told the girl that I did not watch a movie, I just channel surfed for a few minutes. She asked if somebody else was in the room with me and I told her my wife was , but she never even touched the TV. She eventually took the movie off the bill, but it took a few minutes to get it straight, and I had a plane to catch at SD Airport. I was not thrilled that I was even doubted. 5)The room itself: decide for yourself: As mentioned in prior reviews, this really was 1 room and a partial wall was installed to make 2 separate areas. You come into the room, and the sleeping area is first. The air conditioner is in the next section, not the section that you sleep in. To circulate the air, they installed a fan IN the wall separating the 2 areas. The fan is by BROAN, the range hood people, and the sound is identical to the sound that your range hood fan makes. We spent each day we were in SD out all day long, and did not return until dark. Entire days at Wild Animal Park, LegoLand, SD Zoo, Museums, Seaworld, so we were pretty tired by the time we got back to the hotel, showered and went to sleep. Somehow, that fan did not bother us and we slept well each night. So, if you can handle a fan whirring over your bed, it will not be an issue, if you are a light sleeper, you will have a problem. There was a desk to work on next to the A/C, so you froze while working at the desk. The cold air did not seem to come into the sleeping area, fan and all. Still, we were able to sleep. Conclusion: You need to decide what is important in your life. I liked the great access to several freeways. I liked the breakfast , it was fine. I liked the free parking, if you found a spot, and know how to back in you will be fine. The place was secure as your plastic room key got you into the outside property doors as well. The hotel was reasonable priced. If you just need a place to have breakfast, sleep and shower you will be OK with this hotel. Downside: The room is claustrophobic as it is real crowded with that wall more a hindrance than a help. I was in an Embassy Suite and that is really a Suite. This may say Comfort Suite, but I do not agree, this is not a suite, simply a room with a wall that divides one room, doing more harm than good. I called Choice Hotels and stated my displeasure with this setup, and the girl told me many of the Comfort Suites are like this. I will make it my business to stay in a regular room next time. I will not turn my back on Choice Hotels, as I have been happy in many other properties that I have stayed in. I once stayed in a Clarion and it was magnificent, and I once stayed in a Sleep Inn that was fabulous. You must really do some soul searching about this particular property, to see if you can deal with a fan over your head while you are trying to sleep.

The staff was pretty polite and attentive. We had arrived early and had a few hours to kill. We left our luggage with the front desk and they told us to call in a couple hours to see if there were any rooms ready. This was not a problem. We called back and they had a room ready for us. The room was clean and the bathroom looked like it was upgraded. The tile and countertop were really nice. However, there was a stuffiness upon entry. We opened up a window to let the room air out. The set up in the room is pretty good and I liked the idea of having two televisions, came in handy. If you are into fitness, there is an exercise room that consists of one treadmill, a couple of bikes and two eliptical trainer machines. One of the bikes did not work and the treadmill was pretty worn out, made a lot of noise at the higher levels. I was still able to get a good work out with what was there.

I have stayed in many, many hotels and motels throughout my life (I used to be an Events Planner for an Internet Company) and I can honestly say that this hotel is nice, for the price range and type of hotel it is. My daughter, mother and I stayed in this hotel for three nights, arriving the first night around 8:30pm. The lobby is very nice- all marble floor, nice designs on wall and a cute fireplace (I think faux-fireplace). I'm always a little leery of night-staff as they tend to be less accomodating and pleasant. However, this was not the case. When I walked in, there was a line of one person with another person at the desk and one staff person helping the guest at the desk. After a minute or so, the staff person, looked directly at me and said that he would be right with me. It did take some time to get waited on, but he was certainly going as fast as possible with each guest while still giving good customer service. When he got to me, he was very pleasant and helpful. We had a family suite- a main room with a second room with a sofabed separated by french doors. Yes, the room is ont he small side, but really, I've stayed in smaller and paid much more for it. The bathroom was nice with a long counter and the shower and toilet were clean and stain-free. The only downside was our room was at the end, next to the door that went out to the parking lot, so we had door noise and people noise, but again, nothing too unbearable and anyway, it was certainly not anything the hotel could be faulted for. The hotel offers a complimentary continental breakfast every morning from 6-9:30am. Very nice, not extravagent, but there were 4 cold cereal choices, instant oatmeal, bagels, bread, pastries. muffins, apples and oranges, milk, coffee, hot chocolate, 2 kinds of juice, a microwave, two toasters and butter and jam. I had several occasions to talk to the front staff and each time it was someone different and each time, they were pleasant and helpful. When we called to request two extra blankets, they arrived within 5 minutes. ON the 2nd night, we arrived late back to the hotel and there were no parking spaces, so the front desk person told me to park in their red zone right outside the lobby overnight. No muss, no fuss. I would certainly stay there again. By the way, they have a very nice pool and hot tub and provide towels right at the pool.", "Date": "September 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, Ca", "Title": "\u201cExtremely disappointed\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3779602", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and will never stay here again. It was one of the most uncomfortable hotels that my family has ever stayed in. First of all, it was immediately apparent that our \"2-room suite\" was merely a regular-sized room where they put in a wall with French doors to create 2-rooms. The bedroom is so small that you have to close the drawers in order to walk in front of the bed. Also, the air circulation was extemely poor. The original air conditioner is in the front room. When the French doors are closed, the cool air only hits the front room. In order circulate cool air into the bedroom, they installed a cheap, inefficient circular fan built into the wall to blow the cool air into the bedroom. The front room was freezing, while the bedroom got hardly any air. It was very uncomfortable for my teenaged son, who slept on the sofa bed in the front room. In order to keep him from freezing to death, mgmt brought us a cheap portable fan for our bedroom, so we could turn down the air conditioner. Also, the parking is terrible! The spaces were sooo small that SUVs could barely fit. There were not enough parking spaces for every guest. We definitely will never stay here again. When I complained to the management they said we were welcome to check out and find accomodations elsewhere. Our stay was so bad that we will never stay at any Comfort Inn or any of the CHOICE hotels chain.", "Date": "August 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fountain Valley, CA", "Title": "\u201cComfort Inn- Camino Del Rio South\u201d", "Author": "hspandorf", "ReviewID": "UR3748836", "Content": "We recently stayed at this hotel August 2005 for 5 nights.

The few criteria I was looking for was a kid suite type room, complimentary breakfast and free parking. We were only staying 3 mights, so I took a chance. I booked a kid suite room, which has the bunk bed and queen bed with sliding french doors separating the two rooms. Yes, its true it wasn't the biggest of rooms, but the bunk bed and their own TV was a hit with my kids (ages 7 and 4). I've seen better complimentary breakfasts, but all my kids eat is cereal, anyway, and my husband and I were ok with the bagels. I thought the room was clean and the bathroom was larger than I expected. If you are expecting 5 star, don't come here...but my kids loved the pool, which wasn't crowded the time we were there, they loved their bunk bed and their own TV. I also noted the housekeeping staff actually said \"Hello\" when you passed them in the hallway. The location was also great. We spent the day on Coronado Island and it took all but 15 minutes to get there. The Target and the large shopping mall was across the highway from the hotel.
