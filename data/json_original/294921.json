The breakfast buffet of cheeses and breads, olives and eggs and more made us fully energized for a full day of sightseeing. Not sure what to do in Istanbul? We weren't exactly sure on everything either, but the staff helped us choose the best events to attend and places to see! Make sure you check out a cruise along the Bosporus River and a cultural Sufi performance. Thanks to the Hotel Antea, and lovely weather, we were able to walk to all the main sightseeing attractions!

We were very happy with this pick, the hotel is fabulous, and the room was very spacious, as well as bathroom was very large and lovely. The hotel in overall was kept in very good conditions, clean and tidy, to the highest standards. We were also very satisfied with the customer service and all staff, who were very friendly and polite, providing fantastic service. Especially nice surprise for us was to get upgraded upon arrival (completely free of charge!) to a suite-room, needless to say how glad and stunned we were. Despite excellent room condition and staff service, we were a bit disappointed with breakfast and food selection. There was average choice of eggs, cheese, cereals, the sausages were rather bad. It was very disappointing that they did not serve any of the traditional Turkish food, but only very average breakfast meal. Another downside of the hotel was its location. The hotel is located next to the rail station and football pitch. The walking distance to the famous Sultan Ahmed area is about 10-15 minutes. However, the greatest disadvantage was Hamam and Spa service that were closing at 6.00pm. This was really inconvenient as we were planning to spend our day out in the town and sightseeing, and in the evening we would prefer to go to sauna and spa and relax after long tiring day. Moreover, they did not provide Hamam service, which was very upsetting as one of our main priorities when choosing a hotel was availability of Hamam and sauna.

Jacuzzi was the pinnacle of the experience. When I tried to warm myself up in it and turned on the pump, brown slimy gunk came out of it.

They then provided an extension lead for the kettle, but the only place it could go was from the razor socket in the bathroom, and sit on the floor. This was not safe as the shower base leaked and flooded the bath room. There were no shelves in the bath room so all your personal bits and pieces had to be carried in and out. The heated towel rail didn't work, the TV wouldn't change station, the radiator was locked off, the toilet cistern ran constantly and when the air conditioning packed up, rather than repair it, they switched it of permanently at the contact breaker board.

If you want to be treated as a valuable individual even if you are a member of a large group-you should not hesitate to give a shot to this hotel. 3. If you appreciate kindness, friendliness and professionalism-this is the place to be. 4.If you respect past and value present-this is the place where you will see the blends. 5. If you want to be treated as a person and not as a \"walking cash machine\"-you must stay at this hotel, because you will feel loved and appreciated by who you are and not by the amount of money you will spend and days you will stay. Having said so, the hotel staff will assist you with every single acquirement you have. They will arrange best restaurants with best reasonable price (Yildizlar restaurant , for example); they will arrange personal drivers-free of charge (to any of those best- price restaurants and back to hotel). Many more friendly services, that will leave happiness and satisfaction on you. By the time you will leave this hotel, you will missed-I guarantee, you will have nostalgia for the wonderful staff you met at your stay.

We thought western chain hotel would be a safer bet as we can expect ceratin standards. If we were to go back to Istanbul, we will be booking a Turkish one. Overall, we thought this hotel is overcharging for what they provide - a cheap motel with decandant untasteful decoration in less than ideal location - if you want a good night sleep, don't bother. Below are the specifics (sorry the list is rather long): (1) Location: - At the bottom of a very steep hill in a very residential area (not an upmarket residential area, and rather poor lighting at night) - located between a technical college & local football pitch (the ones locals come to play) - Away from any public transport - it looked on the map when we were looking at reviews, and yes the Blue Mosque & Hagia Sofia is in a walking distance, but the closest tram stop is on the top of a very steep hill (40 degrees?) (2) Room: - Walls are so thin that we could hear the next room occupants putting coins and keys on desks, if they watch TV, you hear every word, I had to ask people in the corridor to stop talking two days in a row as they woke me up from my sleep - Rooms are decorated untastefully - imagine red carpets you see in cheap pubs meets either light green or lavender fake velvet bed cover - Tiny shower - I am 5\"2 (156cm) tall, size 8 (UK)/4(US)/38~40(EU) female, and I just about managed to shower. My husband, 5\"11 tall, managed but struggled. - no bath - we saw a room with a bath but the size of the bath is just enough to sit (as in sit on a chair) - unless you are a 6month old baby, you won't be able to lie down - smoke rising up from main atrium seeping into the rooms - wardrobe was very small, not enough hangers for those who stay longer than a night or two (3) Sleep: - Thanks to the thin walls, we could not sleep until the next door guests stop watching TV, and as mentioned, I had to ask in my PJ to other guests in the corridor to keep their voices down, and I was woken up 2 days in a row thanks to guests talking in the corridor - located right next to a college who seems to have PE classes from early in the morning meant that we kept hearing all sorts of alarms from speakerphones in addition to men shouting on a costant basis (4) Breakfast - one of the poorest buffet I havecome across at this grade of hotel - coffee was practically over boiled every morning - we were reminded not very politely that we came to breakfast late - they didn't bother giving us any benefit of doubt despite that there was a time change - we didn't realise they change on Monday, not Sunday like rest of Europe or US, so when we saw the sign at arrival, we thought it was already done - and the clocks in the room doesn't change as it's not one of those synchronising ones - breakfast is provided in the lobby floor with no natural light or window of any kind (5) Service / Sales pitch on arrival: - When we arrived, the manager on duty talked us through diffierent hotel organised tour options - we recommend not to take them - they are overcharging you - They try to sell you the tours but don't tell you there is a street just 5mins down the road filled with seafood restaurants with nice atomosphere (6) view from the hotel - Not much of a view of Sea of Marmara or Blue Mosque or any other - if you go to the roof top, you can see the sea, but isn't a great view thanks to the football pitch with high fence in front of the hotel - our room had a view of the college playground (7) Miscellaneous - lift - was not working properly on the day of arrival (and another day later in the week) - our room was on the 2nd floor, but by the time you spend 8hours walking around the city, walking up and down the stairs and hills, last thing you want is dragging your shopping up 2 flights of stairs with aching legs and feet - some of the amernity items were empty - I opened the box of shower cap, which was empty, I opened another box for some Q tips, they were empty - our safety box didn't work very well (or that the instruction provided was not very useful) - the room key - didn't work a few times during the 5 day stay (eg each time we have to go back down to reception to get this sorted) For this, we thought 104 euros a night (416 euros for 4 nights) was rather expensive.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria", "Title": "\u201cIts different, oriental but too small and loud\u201d", "Author": "romantix1", "ReviewID": "UR101985237", "Content": "Plus: Very clean, friendly staff, Oriental look Minus: too small rooms and bath rooms,loud - roadwork on the backside and footballfield at the entry.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "RAF Akrotiri", "Title": "\u201c4* hotel in 3* neighbourhood; excellent value for money\u201d", "Author": "bencampion", "ReviewID": "UR98162331", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights with family in a huge room with an overaweing round bed - wasted on us with the girls staying in the same room! 2 single beds put in the room for the girls worked well and made for excellent value for money.

A small endless pool, sauna & turkish masage room area that was in operation, although not quite finished, during our stay. We had breakfast every day, which was OK, if unexciting, but a Best Western staple (we have stayed with a much worse Best Western hotel in Athens before). We ate once in the evening, which was (surprisingly) cheaper than many local restaurants and well presented, although not much choice. The staff were very attentive and looked like they had been working 24/7 to ensure the hotels success during its refurbishment.
