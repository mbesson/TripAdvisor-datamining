{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great for diving and relaxation!!!! Nice resort. 2.5 hours from the airport in Denpasar. Been there 3 times in 2007 to chill and dive. It has 10 chalets, clean and simple with ensuite, reasonably priced. No TV or phones, but with steady power supply and good cellphone coverage if you need these. Food is ok, beer is cold, but staff willing to direct you or arrange for a drive to nearby restaurants.the staff were friendly and helpful and always met my requests with a smile.Ask for the sea view chalets right in front of the beach.You can dive off the resort beach or dive shallow wrecks within 30 mins by boat. It has dive shop and the guides are great. Look for a Mr Komang Lara, great dive guide, knows great spots for little critters and big fishes. Always nice dives (except jan and feb, when it rains) with little or no current.All in a rustic resort with modern comforts.", "Date": "Jan 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR768075030", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "kopiboy"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469406-d941643-r12482663-Scuba_Seraya_Resort-Tulamben_Bali.html", "HotelID": "941643", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
