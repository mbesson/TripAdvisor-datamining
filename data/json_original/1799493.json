If you are looking for a hotel filled with personality and atmosphere then this is it. The rooms are bright, spacious and cleaned daily, staff are friendly and welcoming and overall great value. By the second day the place felt like home and we vowed to stay there again if we were ever to visit Playa in the future. 2 weeks later and we stll miss it!", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reiskirchen", "Title": "\u201cOur favorite place\u201d", "Author": "Bernd R", "ReviewID": "UR124765231", "Content": "Our favorite place in Playa Since more tha 20 years we're coming to Playa del Carmen every Winter. Playa has grown in size maybe 20 times - \"Jardin de Marieta\" has only grown in beauty and ambience. The little hotel has 11 rooms and appartments of different sizes, all individually decorated and very clean and facing a beautiful tropical garden. On the ground floor are small shops, an art gallery, a massage studio and an italian restaurant. It is located directly at the famous 5th Avenue and only one block from the beach. And although it's in the heart of Playa it's still quiet and peaceful. The couple who runs the place, Matthias and Marieta, are very friendly and helpful. \"Jardin de Marieta\" is our place in Playa since more than 20 years - try it!!! Bernd and Hilde from Germany", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Paul", "Title": "\u201cA bit of Jungle on the 5th\u201d", "Author": "Michael M", "ReviewID": "UR123884080", "Content": "Walk into a taste of Playa 30 years ago. They left the Jungle alive and well inside this quaint little hotel. Great location right on 5th ave. Good restaurant and some good shops in the same complex. Spa too. Rooms are clean , some have kitchenettes. Various room options, they even have palapa style room up on the top floor. Very friendly people. Very nice experiance , not your typical stay, more cultural I would say...worth the stay.....", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Jardin de Marieta", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d1799493-Reviews-Jardin_de_Marieta-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">5 Avenida Norte No. 173</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Entre Calle 6 y 8</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Playa del Carmen</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">77710</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1799493", "ImgURL": ""}}
