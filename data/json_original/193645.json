The bedroom did not have double glazing and sirens and street noise woke us up throughout the night. At breakfast we decided to have an English breakfast hoping it would fill us up for the day. There were far to many staff in the wierd old people smelling restaurant (if you can call it a restaurant) and they spoke poor English. For breakfast there were around 6 other diners with over 8 staff in the restaurant hovering around us while we ate and one woman even stood against the wall by where we ate for ages and made us feel very awkward. The breakfast that we thought could have filled us was an over cooked small peice of bacon , a cremated sausge and an egg that could have been reheated from the day before(in fact it could have all have been heated back up from the day before), it was all very greasy and my fiancee had a bad stomach all day after it. To top it off we had toast with out breakfast and as I was eating it and still had another piece left to eat, the woman who had been hovering came and took my plate from under me while I was still in the middle of eating!!! Can you believe that. I said \" excuse me Im still eating\" she still had my plate in her hand and looked at me confused. I said it again and pointed to my food, she still didnt give me my plate back so my fiancee had to more or less shout at her to get her to understand I was still eating and still had a peice of toast left!!

In addition, the beds are quite comfortable. -The Mitre House is in a nice, convenient location. A 5 minute walk from Paddington station which has several subway lines. However, if you are flying from Gatwick airport I would recommend staying near Victoria Station instead which is more centrally located. Also, although the street right next to this hotel does have nice pubs and decent restaurants, most of the major siteseeing places are significant subway/bus rides away. The Bad -Some of the employees of the hotel are very unfriendly. Whether this is a big deal to you or not certainly depends. But, for example, I wanted to use my calling card from the room and I called down to the front desk to ask how to use the room phone. All I had to do was dial an 0800 number. However, the employee at the front desk would not activate my room phone and said that if I wanted to use it I would need to deposit 100 pounds! Also, if you stay at this hotel BRING YOUR OWN SHAMPOO. I asked for shampoo and one of the employees made a phone call to someone to request it for me. When I went down later to find out where the shampoo was another employee said they do not have any and I had to buy it around the corner. The next day they again told me to buy shampoo around the corner. When I went around the corner the cheapest and smallest bottle was about 4 pounds (this translates to about 7 dollars for a small bottle of shampoo). Again, not a big deal to some, but certainly at the time these were inconveinences. -The rooms are very small. We got used to it by the end of the stay, but just be aware. However, it is a good trade off for the price and cleanliness. If I was go to back to London I would stay near Victoria Station as the area seems a little more upscale and is more centrally located.
