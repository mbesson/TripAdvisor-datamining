The hotel is located in the Marina district of Dubai and is a perfect location for the beach, restaurants, yacht club and Dubai Metro (easy to use to get to other main parts of the city including the airport). Non-smoking room was comfortable and clean, looked on to Marina and yachts. Roof top pool good, in the shade mid afternoon but not really a problem. On site restaurants and bar fine, although found breakfast a little expensive for what we had, probably better to go to one of the local eateries near the beach. Found a greet little supermarket (Amalyos I think), just around the corner to the right of the entrance, open 24 hours, serves great vegetable samosas!

Good 4 star hotel, good location with all the trimmings of a 5 star in your room including teasmaid/bathrobe etc. Room rate excellent value. Bedroom decor lovely, clean and bed very comfortable. Good facilities - English Bar with bands most nights, Amadeus Bar with beautiful music played by a quartet every night. Staff very attentative and helpful. Especially Darrin. Girls in business centre also very helpful and pleasant. If you do not require the full breakfast at hotel, pop across the road from hotel to Bobs fish & chip shop where they are very happy to accommodate any kind of breakfast request. - they open 7am and close approx 4am! I would definitely stay here again, however, unfortunately I would be slow to recommend it because of the noise from the disco at night. It didnt keep my husband and I awake at night but we did hear other guests complaining about the loud music. If going on tours, company which hotel use very expensive - nearly doubt price of other companies. Check around.

The Chaikofski bar manager was checking every table in her outlet to check if the guests are satisfied and happy ( she is Awsome and fantastic ) the English pub at the lobby is fantastic, the decoration is unique you think yourself at the midages travelled by time to Henry the 8th Era. although it is a 4 star rated hotel but the service and the wellcoming i had during my stay was over my expectations, and honestly i didnt see it in some 5 stars hotels i stayed in. it worth the price we paid for the stay The People who are running the hotel are doing a great job in training, follow ups, handling guests complaints, well done guys ill recommend your hotel to all my contacts, and whenever im at Dubai ill stay in Marina Byblos Hotel", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "Arabella80", "ReviewID": "UR120447148", "Content": "I stayed at Marina Byblos for 6 days in November and very much enjoyed my stay there.

Room's facilities and design is also excellent. I ordered from in-dinding menu couple times and the meal was delicious. i like the area where the hotel is: there is supermarket one minute away, amazing view to marina in couple minutes reach (I personnaly think it is one of the most beautiful views in Dubai) and public beach in 10 min walk. Nearby there is also aphgani-paki restaurant with fantastic and not expensive meal (it's just under the bridge).For those who need to use tube, it is in 5 min walk.

On arrival we were welcomed with a fresh glass of juice and a cold flannel and excellent service. Our room was spectacular with views of the marina, everything is new and beds are very comfortable, bathrooms are very trendy and very clean and the little gadget by your bed that controls all the lighting in the room and air con is most impressive. Tv has alot of choice of english channels, only problem we had was the internet was extremely slow and of course its not free and our hot watter took about 20 minutes in the evening to heat up to have a shower, the daytime it was fine. Didnt hear a thing from other rooms and love the fact you can litterally smoke anywhere in the building as well as your room and the english pub. food is superb espescially the buffet and the english pub does excellent food but make sure you are hungry as the portions are for a family of 5 i think lol and really good food ! there is an excellent band that play there on thurs & fri nights and it was the best live band I have ever been to, the singer was amazing and alot of the songs were upto date songs, the bar is huge and was packed with a really good friendly atmosphere, everyone was dancing by the end of the night well 3am. bar staff are excellent and I always had a drink in my hand as they wait on you 24/7. Drinks are expensive so be warned but thats what it is like in most of the bars out there. The swimming pool on the roof top is beautiful and lots of shade if needed with very comfortable sun loungers, pool was perfect temperture too. I highly reccommend this hotel and when myself and my husband go to live out there I will definitely be a regular at the english pub and will reccomend this hotel to family and friends.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Marina Byblos Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d2281355-Reviews-Marina_Byblos_Hotel-Dubai.html", "Price": "$167 - $545*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Dubai Marina</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">123233</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2281355", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/11/ab/11abba7724c2b3e3f240e2059666ff591large.jpg"}}
