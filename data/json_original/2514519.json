Unfortunately, this was not up to the high standards we experienced there. Despite having paid fully in advance the staff were adamant we had to pay at reception, which entailed wasting an entire morning on the phone trying to sort everything out in the absence (typically) of a manager. The room was okay but the bathroom was no bigger than a cupboad with a malfunctioning shower and no fan so the room quickly filled up with steam. Equally the TV and hairdryer both failed to work on arrival. Further we found ourselves placed next to the elevator shaft with the wonderful nighttime accompaniment of whirring and banging noises. Breakfast was acceptable but the staff hovered uncomfortably around us the whole time, with grim stony faces constantly asking if we needed coffee and literally chucking toast at us every five minutes. Overall it was a clean hotel with a decent breakfast but terrible staff who treated you more as an annoyance than as a guest.

Very compact (as often expected for London terraced property hotels). Depressing dark orange and blue decor - tired although at least not dirty. Shower room was relatively new, but the sink was so tiny I could barely wash my hands, let alone brush my teeth. I can only imagine having a shave would be tricky. The shower had two settings - hot and burning hot. The room was overheated (window wide open all night) in March, so a hot summer night would be unpleasant.

Even boiling it produced rather grim tasting tea that didn't make me feel so good. In fact, in a bored moment, I read from the folder in the room that no one ever reads, and it is stated there that guests shouldn't drink the tap water and should either buy bottled water or ask reception to bring a jug of drinking water to their room! If this were the only problem here, it wouldn't be so bad. There is next to no tv reception on the next-to-knackered tiny portable televisions that were possibly bought 25 years ago, the shower (where you just about break your neck coming out of it as the shower, toilet and sink are all rammed into a tiny room) hardly worked, starting warm then cold then warm then cold then off, the heating wasn't working, you can hear just about any noise outside the room as the walls are thin, the bed just about had the springs coming out of the mattress, the breakfast was very basic, with the coffee unpalatable, and the whole place was soulless and more like a poor bed and breakfast place than a branded hotel. I haven't stayed in a Best Western hotel before, but I'll avoid them like the plague in future.

Room was on top floor so used the elevator, it is a bit on the small side and fairly slow as often is the case in the hotels in rebuilt Victorian houses.

Free wifi (was strong enough to reach my room, in reception they said it was not sure it would be strong enough there so received a cable as well) is included and it worked well. Bed was pretty comfortable so slept well.

I stayed six nights in a single room which, of course, was small, but it is good that there are single rooms for a more reasonable price wjern traveling alone.

There were rolls, croissants, lots of fruit, yoghurt. And coffee served at the table. It's an excellent location with Pimlico tube just 5 mins. away, a nice cafe on the way to it. #24 bus runs right in front of the hotel all the way to the West End.

Just when you think you have the right temperature, it turned hot again. Miserable! The room was also not clean. Someone left behind hair and there were dead bugs. If you think you can use the phone to call the front desk, think again. There was a \"reception desk\" button, but it just rang. I went in person to the front desk and was told you are not supposed to use that button, dial \"0\". Back to the room, dialed \"0\" and that did not work either. Don't believe the online information saying they are multilingual. An Italian gentleman staying there came to the front desk trying to ask questions, and the clerk shrugged his shoulders. While I don't speak Italian either, I did hear pizzeria in his question. With no knowledge of Italian, I was able to assist by saying \"Pizzeria\" and pointing in the direction down the street. On another occasion, I asked if there was a phone book so we could find a French or German restaurant. After checking around, he said they must have thrown out the phone books. He then proceeded to call friends so they could find one. He did tell me there was a French restaurant 3 blocks away, but said we would not want to do there because it is too expensive.

The hotel is kind of boutique-ish. For walkers and other people who like to explore big cities, the Corona is reasonably well situated. Pimlico tube station is about three minutes walk, Victoria station is only an eight minute walk. There are probably two dozen little restaurants of all descriptions (Italian, euro-modern, up-scale vegetarian, mid-scale vegetarian, Indian, mediterranean, pub fare) and several good pattisseries (late night snacks!) and other shopping within a 1-10 minute walk of the hotel. The Corona is one of 48(!?!) small hotels which are located on Belgrave Road stretching from Lupus St in the south to King's Road in the north. That's a lot of hotels on a 2 kilometer long street even for central London, so the Corona staff are used to lots of traffic. That said, don't expect anything but cool, business-like service. The hotel has few amenities, but the well-appointed rooms are very clean and comfortable and that's a lot of value, I think, for $130-$150/night in London. The only downside is wireless internet connectivity, which is handled by a third-party service provider - it's a bit pricey, the connection is slow and if Best Western decides to update/improve only one thing in the hotel, internet service should be it.

I was in a single and though I don\u2019t think a human could touch both walls, I did have to pause to consider the question. The wall paper and paint in the rooms were fresh and the bathroom seemed recently renovated. Everything was clean and orderly. In fact, the cleaning staff found a good balance between keeping my room clean and not disturbing my things. I found the staff helpful and courteous. The location is good, less than three blocks from the Pimlico tube stop and only a little further to Victoria station. Belgrave Road is home to a number of other budget hotels, there is a Holiday Inn Express across the street and another Best Western two blocks north. On the downside, there were a number of small things that were annoying while a few bigger ones might disqualify this hotel for some people. First, there is NO AIR CONDITIONING. While this is not often a problem in London, it was while I was there. Due to the small size of the room and the placement of the furniture it was impossible to fully open the windows when the air was cool. The windows would not stay open with the drapes closed, plus there is enough street noise to make an open window incompatible with sleep, at least for me. A small table fan helped, but not as much as ceiling fans and modern windows would have. Now for the more petty complaints. The furniture in my room had seen some hard use, chipped and dented close to the floor where it had no doubt been hit by luggage. There was no flat sheet on the bed, just a duvet, which was far too warm to use for most of my stay. There were two drawers in a small desk, but the top one was filled with a blow dryer bolted to the interior and the bottom one had an electric tea kettle, mug, spoon, tea, sugar and milk. This left the five hangers as the only place to put clothing. In the morning, the cleaners run the vacuum in the hallway starting at about 9:30 am, frequently bumping the walls for extra effect. The doors seemed noisier than in any other hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed in. I started to hear doors banging early in the morning, making it hard to sleep off my jet lag. So would I stay here again? In cool weather, almost certainly -- mainly due to the location and price. I paid an average of $115 per night including taxes.

First, the pros. The location could not be better. Absolutely superb. It's about a block away from the Pimlico Tube station, which is a few short stops from everything you'll want to see in London. It's in a nice, safe, residential neighborhood w/ several pubs and convenience stores, plus an internet cafe. The service is good too. The front desk staff is nice and helpful. They gave us a map that gave us discounts to lots of stuff, which they didn't have to do. The rooms are clean and the bathrooms are fine. A breakfast buffet is included w/ limited hours every morning. The food is standard fare, nothing fancy, but decent and nothing to complain about. Now, for the cons. This room is small. I mean, tiny! It's small by european hotel standards. There was literally no room for the suitcase on the floor. The double bed took up the entire room. There's no closet, just an open armoir. The bathroom door opens up toward the bed instead of near the doorway like most hotels. In fact, you cannot open the bathroom door all the way, b/c it hits the side of the bed. It's that small. Secondly, the amenities are quite lacking. They provided shampoo, but no conditioner. The hair dryer was not located in the bathroom, so it was two days before I found it. And when I did locate it, I found it to be damaged. There was no refrigerator or safe. There is also no room service. The bed in our room was very uncomfortable. Neither of us slept well the entire four nights we were there, and my spouse actually awoke in pain most mornings. But the biggest negative to this hotel for me would have to be that the walls in the rooms are painted ORANGE!!! I don't know what the management was thinking when they did that! It is nearly impossible to sleep well in a brightly painted orange room. I literally couldn't sleep w/o Benadryl. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this hotel. there are some positives, but they are unfortuantely outweighed by the negatives.

The only problem was the breakfast room which is small for the number of rooms in the hotel. There are only 30 seats available and unless you get there for the start of breakfast or the end of serving there is uaually a queue to get a table. We also found that it is set for couples and if there are three or more people, it could be difficult to get seats together. We tried to move two tables together on the first morning and the restaurant manageress went a bit over the top and told us we could not move the tables (someone else made a comment about her in a previous review). We insisted and asked to bring the hotel manager if it was a problem and she backed away and was very pleasant with us for the rest of our stay. So stand your ground to get the seating you want. Oh and you only get complimentary biscuits for the first day of your stay which seemed a little on the mean side. If you booked in everyday you would get them! There is a little Italian restaurant just up the road ' SOLE MIO' which is reasonably priced and the food is top quality. The hotel is just 4-5 minutes walk from Pimlico Underground which is on the Victoria line which is handy for central London and also runs directly to Euston Station if you arrive by train. You can get a day rover ticket for \u00a35.10 after 9.30am which lasts for the remainder of the day. generally a thumbs up and we would stay again.", "Date": "November 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada.", "Title": "\u201cWould not go back\u201d", "Author": "ValpOntario", "ReviewID": "UR10197300", "Content": "The room was the smallest, smelliest and most expensive place we have ever been in.

I must have stayed somewhere different compared to the 'small and luxurious' hotel being described by some of the writers. The Receptionist on arrival was friendly and helpful. The Receptionist on departure asked 'which room' and 'enter you PIN'. No other words. The breakfast staff, of which there appeared to be 2 were incredibly busy - more on the food later, but didn't appear to be welcoming guests. The room - I booked a single as I was travelling alone. There must be bigger cells in HM Prisons as to the room I stayed in. The room was about the width of two and a half single beds and depth of one and a half. There were 3 windows. Two were incredibly small and the third had been painted over with black paint. The curtains were matching but one piece of fabric which didn't fully cover the window (although there was a cream coloured fabric covering the glass. I had to stand on the bed or the chair to see out of the window. The desk had 3 drawers, one of which had been removed. The bottom drawer held the kettle and cup, some tea, coffee etc. The hairdryer which was fixed was adequate but you had to hold your hand on the button to keep it going. At the bottom of the bed there was a wardrobe, with no door and a tray stand inside with a 14\" portable on top of the wardrobe. The ensuite consisted of a shower, toilet and wash-hand basin. Again it was incredibly small, room only to stand between the loo and shower. The towels were quite hard and seemed to be fairly old. The shower was hot with good pressure. The room was tidied and bed made but the linen on the bed wasn't changed though I did receive fresh towels. The selection from room service was disgraceful. 3 hot meals consisting of Tomato Soup, Lasagne and Cannonilli. The rest was sandwiches. The breakfast room was located in the basement of the building. It was filled to over flowing when I went down. I hovered for a bit before I was given a table. The breakfast consisted of orange and apple juice (glasses were slow in coming), cereal (4 types), fruit (4 types - one was prunes and another grapefruit), hard small rolls, croissants, ham and cheese. Tea and coffee. Toast came as I was leaving but no butter or jam. Another guest was put at my table as she was on her own also. It would have been nice to have been asked.

The dining room is small and cramped and if you go at the wrong time you'll have to queue for a seat. If you aren't up for breakfast when it begins then you are unlikely to ever see the selection of foods on offer. This hotel does continental breakfasts only and the variety of food available is poor. The pastries run out very quickly, the toast will be cold when it arrives and the restaurant staff are very unfriendly.

I didn't expect much since the price was significantly cheaper than many other hotels in the area but this hotel turned out to be a very good value. The hotel is a property converted from the traditional English residence with British interior decor. Location wise, it's roughly 10 minutes walk to the Victoria Station, which is extremely convenient for me since I had to catch the express train from the station to Gatwick Airport. The room, of course, is your typical European \"single\" size room - small yet functional, very clean and tidy. Absolutely nothing fancy about it but for the price I paid (less than 50 pounds a night), a clean room with a clean bed is all I need and I got exactly just that. The bathroom is small but the shower area is relatively spacious compared to many other hotels that I stayed in Europe before. Breakfast is included in the price but don't expect much other than cold ham & cheese, juice drink, cold cereal, coffee, etc. One thing worths mentioning is the FREE internet access throughout hotel, which is fantastic and very unusual for London. Most hotels in this town will charge you a premieum for that. Many reviews here complained about the front desk reception which I had absolutely no problem with. Maybe I was lucky but I seem to only encounter the professional and courteous staff at the hotel this time. Overall, I give my thumbs up for BW Corona.
