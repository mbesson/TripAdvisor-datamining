They blamed Orbitz for overbooking even though we all had booked the trip at the same time 4 months in advance! The hotel then proceeded to split our group and send 2 couples to their sister resort the Viva Wyndham Azteca, while promising the 2 couples that had rooms at the Maya resort the same rooms at the Azteca the next day. Later that evening we find out that the 2 couples at the Azteca can come to the Maya and use their all inclusive to drink and eat, but we can't go to the Azteca and do the same????? Day 2 of our 5 day stay begins with us going to the Azteca to make sure we have comparable rooms as the Maya. We find that not only do they not have comparable rooms, they only have 1 available!!! This is after we were PROMISED that they would do everything possible to keep our group together! The staff at the Azteca were not very helpful and rude to boot! Somehow \"miraclusly\" they find rooms for our friends back at the Maya! Not only do we spend half of our day trying to get our group back together, coordinate our return shuttle service and start our vacation, the maya comps the 2 couples that move back to the Maya complimentary spa days!!!! Nothing for the 2 couples that lost most of the day trying to deal with their screw ups!!! We were treated with total disrespect when we tried to receive the same spa comps ourselves!! Again they just blamed everything on Orbitz. The only bright spot was Manuel from Gray Line Cancun, he spent most of the morning trying to help us get everything straightened out even though he and his company didn't have anything to do with the Maya's screw up and total lack of help from their staff!!! All in all we were very disappointed in the hotel's service and willingness to help remedy our groups situation. The food was only so so and having to make reservations to the resteraunts a day in advance was ridiculous!! Everytime we tried to make a reservation the Maya would tell us that they were booked so we ended up eating the buffet most nights and even went into town to eat one night. All the while walking past the so called booked resteraunts to see mostly empty tables! I will say the beach and the rest of the staff i.e. bar and cleaning were excellent. Our group was looking forward to this trip for 4 months and it was the first time to Mexico for 2 of our couples and thanks to the Viva Wyndham Maya it did not get off to a good start!!

The real highlight were the evening shows (comedy sketches, dance routines, quiz nights, costume events, etc.) - the staff members took great care to prepare for these special occasions and we truly found them entertaining (the language spoken was mostly English).

We did the Mexican (Don Diego) which was our favorite, as well as Portofino and the Italian one at Aztec-all had excellent service and amazing food. Snack bar was more left overs (rice, vegetables, meat) than snacks, however the pizza was very good as were the burgers. The drinks weren't that great-too sweet for me as they were made from mixes rather that real ingredients. The lobby bar was much better that the bar by the pool, but they also weren't as busy. The cafe Maya was amazing. Rooms clean, safes worked fine ($2USD/day) The beds/pillows were the most comfortable of any Mexican resort I have stayed at. We stayed in room 1128 which was just steps away from the snack bar. Our room was very loud during the nightly entertainment (bring ear plugs) but for the rest it was an excellent room. The grounds were very clean. Very nicely landscaped. Beach was nice-a lot of seaweed washed up on the beach, but staff was always cleaning it up. I saw a couple of cigarette butts on the beach, but no where near what other reviews were complaining about. We had no problem getting beach chairs. It was sandy as far as you could walk into the ocean-no rocks. There is a wide variety of sports/activities you could do for no charge. We went boogie boarding, took catamaran lessions, and borrowed bikes a couple of times to bike into Playa Del Carmen (about a 10 min bike ride or an easy 30 min walk) The nightly entertainment was too loud for us so we only watched 1.5 shows. They were very good and the staff spoke 4 or 5 different languages so most people could understand what was going on. (There were a lot of Europeans there during our stay-we only ran into 1 other Canadian couple) I would have like the shows alot more if they turned the volume down and started at 830 rather than 930.

Compared to other resorts...(Melia in Cabo, Great Bay Beach Resort, St. Maarten, Best Western Bay Harbor, Tampa, FL) even priced less...this resort barely rated a 4. Upon arrival we noticed the hotel personnel were not in an hurry to help you. I will break down my comments.. Room: We booked through their Rewards By Request program and our room..Rm 1310... was really nice. Near beach..just a little noisy during shows at nite but closed the door and was fine. Beach and Chairs: People were putting towels on chairs by 6:15 am. Since we had silver (grey) bracelets this entitled us to the VIP beach area with great padded chairs and covered umbrella huts. Beach reminded me of Jersey Shore - chairs lined up so close--- or a Bahamas resort. Beach had lots of seaweed on shoreline. Pool: VERY BASIC looking. Did not see a swim up bar. Adult pool was too crowded to stay at. Bar: 2 bartenders that took forever to even acknowledge you were standing in front of them. I always tip at all inclusives and when I did they just took the tip and never even said thank you. Had to ask for extra liquor in drink or dont think they even put any in. Asked for Kahlua and they said they dont have. This is Mexico..isnt that where Kahlua comes from? At times there were lines 15 people deep trying to get drink at pool bar. If you requested something different bartenders acted like it was a bother. Food: AS SOON AS YOU CHECK IN MAKE RESERVATIONS FOR YOUR ENTIRE STAY AT THE RESTAURANTS. No one told us and as at other resorts you did not make reservations for a restaurant THAT day...nothing was left. We ate at Mexican one day and it was good. Got stuck at buffets the rest of the stay. UGLK. It was at best cafeteria/truck stop food. We are not picky eaters at all but it was SAME food at each buffet..very bland. Be very careful walking...all floors are very slippery. Saw many people slipping and falling...even with rubber flip flops on. OK...You probably think I am hard to please...I am not at all. Basic is good for me but this resort was below basic.

I am most particular & would prefer top-of-the-line luxury for all my vacations...but that sometimes is not an option when bringing the entire family along. I admittedly was a little nervous after reading other reviews about the Viva Wyndham Maya....I am here to tell you not to worry....it is a really beautiful place with some of the most friendly people on staff I have ever met. The beach is absolutely breathtaking. I'm not sure there are too many places more beautiful than the Mayan Riviera. Each day the water was different shades of turquoise with different sizes of waves. We were lucky to have beautiful sunshine each day. While the pool was a little smaller than some other resorts, we never felt crowded. In fact, we never had a problem finding a seat at the pool bar, the buffet, the beach, etc. etc. Sometimes we couldn't find four beach chairs together...but we managed. There were a lot of people there, too. The weekend seemed busier than the weekdays...lots of European travelers. I never found anyone to be rude (like some previous reviews say). In fact, I thought that all the different languages being spoken lent a very exotic flair to the location. It also made me think that Playa must really be something special to attract visitors from everywhere. Playa, the city itself, was absolutely amazing. Our teen-aged sons loved our time spent there. Tons of culture! But at the same time safe....very safe! In fact, I never once felt unsafe the entire time. Playacar, the gated community where the resort is, is just breathtaking. What a fabulous backdrop for the beautiful Riviera! A few minor things - yes, the pool decks are slippery - very common in wet concrete :) The staff works tirelessly to squeegy it. Walk slowly. There is a little mildew in the bathroom & the rooms are a little plain jane. The walls are indeed thin & you can hear lots of action going on around you....but, if you're anything like us, we were so tired by the time we hit the sheets each night, it was not a big deal. I actually enjoyed listening to all the activity...We were at the 1000 building near the pool & the beach. Evidently rooms near the resort's entry are more quiet if that's what you need. Also, don't fear being far from the beach if that's the case, everything is within a few-minutes walk....with beautiful scenery and wildlife along the way. The food was decent....a buffet is a buffet...it's what you make it. Don Diego was a delight! All butter warnings are true. It's not real butter. They only time this really mattered to us was when we paid an extra $25 a person for fresh lobster & alas, no real drawn butter. Oh well, we lived. The chips, guacamole & salsa were outstanding....served at the buffet & the snack bar. Delicious drinks....with an espresso bar too! Bartenders never too busy to make a fun non-alcoholic fresh fruit smoothie for the boys...Go, go, go to this place.....the bang for your buck is unbelievable!!!! PS...

Lots of fun things going on through the day. We played a lot of beach volleyball and used the free kayaks every day. The beach and ocean here are exquisite. You can walk for as long as you want down the beach. Just perfect for walking and people watching. There were fewer American guests than European guests the week that we were there, which was a really nice cultural experience for my daughter. She especially liked all the Italians and made many friends playing volleyball. At night, the staff gathers people to go to discos in Playa Del Carmen. We took a cab a few times into Playa to enjoy the street dancers and shops. Just across the street from the Viva is a nice local shopping area. You can borrow free bikes to ride, but I enjoyed just walking around the cobblestone streets in front of the hotel. Many people are out jogging in the mornings. It is in a safe area in a gated community. We didn't have any problems with theft on this trip. On our last trip to cancun, only about 1/2 of my clothes were in my suitcase when I got home. Someone at the airport stole all my swimsuits, workout clothes and other items. So heads-up. If there's something you really love, carry it on the plane. The entertainment wasn't our favorite. A lot of lip-synching and dancing shows. There was a casino night, and a \"Miss Maya\" show that was hillarious. There is a flying trapese for the brave to try, which looked really fun! The food in the buffets wasn't as good as we had hoped, but we could find things to keep us happy. There is a freshly made local food station that was usually the best thing to eat and was good. The buffet dining room is pretty standard and not fancy but it has lots of windows and natural light. The food in the reservation restaurants (Mexican and Italian) was simply amazingly delicious. It was gourmet, served beautifully and fast. The gym is very small but adequate but I wish there would have been a better spa area (steam, whirlpool, etc.). There's a climbing wall for children in the gym and a play area outside for kids. There are tennis courts on the roof which were in good shape. The things I loved about this were that it was on a fantastic beach, it is small, so you can get to your room easily whenever you need to, the staff were fun, the free kayaks were fun, the proximity to Playa Del Carmen is nice, it felt safe, and it's a lower price than some of the other resorts. The things that could be better are food and entertainment. Would I go back? Yes, especially if I'm looking for a good priced trip. If I want to splurge, the Grand Palladium was more elaborate and had better food and spa area. The Viva is the only resort I've been to in Playa and I chose it after very careful research.

When we asked to change rooms we were told it would cost an extra $100 per night, After 4 days of suffering and complaints to the Sunwing rep. they finally moved us. The new room was nice and clean but we no longer had the fridge we paid for, nor did we have any chairs, table, or clock. Beware the floors around the pool, the are incredibly slippery, everyday we saw at least one person hurt badly, including 3 from our group. Good luck if you need help from the front desk, when i asked to change rooms they suddenly did not speak english, When I spoke spanish they simply walked away. Someone needs to explain them what a doorman does ( maybe contact Raul at the barcelo Karmina Palace for some tips) not once in 14 days did they open a taxi door for anyone. The food was DISGUSTING. Things that were not eaten would appear at the next meal, just a hint, cooked broccoli, rice, and stew are not snack items we want to eat at 3am. It was so repetative, day after day, the same undercooked food. Now the good points, the location is great, a $7.00 cab ride, or a 1/2 hour walk to town along the beach. The size is perfect, large enough to have all the amenities, small enough to walk everywhere. The grounds are awesome, the plants and flowers are beautiful. The beach is nice and sandy with no rocks. The coffee bars serve fresh expresso 24 hrs a day, which is a nice break from the booze and juice. The bar staff is excellent. Special round of applause to Reuben, who went out of his way to make sure all guests were treated special. In my opinion this resort can be fixed, but as long as they don't listen to their guests nothing is ever gonna happen. Spend a little more money and stay somewhere else until this place gets a makeover.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation, February 21-26, 2012\u201d", "Author": "ACica", "ReviewID": "UR125251416", "Content": "This was our second consecutive trip to Viva Wyndham Maya since last year.

Highly recommend purchasing Elite Plus seats, express check in, extra leg room at front of plane & preboarding. Dont pick the first row though or you will be staring at a wall, LOL. Bus ride is approx 1 hour from Cancun airport. We were the last resort to be dropped off & thus the last to be picked up on the bus ride home. Air conditioned bus, very comfy. Check in was efficient & quick. We arrived very late, 12:30 am. Our room was to the left past the courtyard, Room 1363, second floor, 2 double beds, small patio facing the Riu next door. You could hear their entertainment at night quite clearly, but it was good music :) Yes, there were much nicer rooms but we found it was just fine for us. beds were comfy but pillows very small. Air conditioning worked perfectly. No mini bar or fridge, and only 1 bottle of water for the week. You can easily refill it at all the bars or purchase new bottles at the lobby store. The resort is very well laid out & it is a pleasure to walk around, compact. the reports of slippery walkways & tiles at pool are true. We were cautious & were fine. The food at the buffet for breakfast, lunch & dinner was excellent. We tried the Mexican & Mediterranean a la cartes. They were both exceptional!The pool bar has breakfast, lunch & then late night food starting at 11, after the shows. The shows start approx 930 & were very entertaining, saw the Moulin Rouge & Hollywood shows. My daughter, 18, watched the 70's show and said it was good also. Excellent coffee/ cappucino available at pool bar & lobby bar all day. Try the Maya Coffee at the lobby bar! We went into Playa del Carmen 3 times. Took a cab, 7$ US one way. Did LOTS of shopping & visited Senor Frogs & Blue Parrot beach club. You could walk but it was sooo hot as we went during the day. there is a small market directly across from the resort. We did a tour with \"Your Private Tours\" & Jay Fletcher. Went to Tulum, Des Ojos cavern, Akumal to swim with sea turtles & Yal-ku to the natural aquarium. Absolutely lovely lunch at La Lunita in Akumal, right on the sea. The ceviche & calamari were amazing. Would highly recommend going this route. We were picked up at 830 & returned to the resort at 5 pm. It was my daughter & myself & 1 other couple in an air conditioned van. Rod was our guide & was remarkable well traveled & knowledgeable about the Mayan Riviera. Lots to do at the VWM. The animation team works very hard to please without being annoying, LOL!!! We did the morning stretching, darts, bingo, volleyball, archery & they had a trapeze if you were brave enough to try it. Pottery kiosk, where you can paint the pieces & the Romeo fires them for you. Lots of kids were doing this, but adults as well. Overall, I would recommend this resort to all my friends & family. Usually, I say i will never go back to the same place as there are so many places to visit, but this resort & staff make it tempting. PS. We felt safe at all times on the resort.

The flight home was delayed an hour...and we heard people who arrived mid week were also delayed an hour...so the question is are they always delayed an hour? And why do we have to stand in a lone at the airport when there isd no staff there???? We were at this hotel for a week. We arrived at 2:20 am tired and ready to relax. The first contact I had was with the front desk clerk who straight out lied to me when I asked if your room looked out at the pool or the beach and he said yes. When you read my review you will see how bald faced that lie was. The hotel- As you leave the lobby and walk into the resort you walk into a large plaza type of area with lots of chairs, couches and seating areas. It is a lovely gathering space throughout the day and evening. The grounds are \u201cnatural\u201d looking\u2026not really manicured lawns, rather paths through \u201cjungle\u201d type of areas. There are some really pretty and interesting areas and parts of the paths are covered with canopies. This is the area where the restaurants are. When you walk through these paths you reach the pool/beach area. Down the sides of this area are the buildings with the rooms with one exception\u2026building 3000. Rooms- We were in building 3000. It is the furthest from the beach/pool area. It is beside the Children\u2019s Centre, the Gym, hotel management offices and has a tennis court on the roof. It is very close to the front street. It does not feel like it is a part of the actual resort. Next to this building is a small pool with a bar that is for adults only. It is called the \u201cquiet\u201d pool. We did not use this area so I cannot comment on what it was like. This building has been renovated and the rooms are very nice\u2026.large with a small couch, a little table and chair. There is a lot of storage for your things. The washroom is large, had a Jacuzzi type of tub, a separate shower and the toilet is in a separate space with a door. The balcony was no larger than two feet wide and the two chairs on it were unusable\u2026they fit pretty much exactly on the balcony with no room for legs. There is a mini fridge in the room but it is empty, no water or drinks provided. When you arrive there is a small (600 ml) bottle of water in the room and that is the only one provided. However, every bar has water available and you can refill the bottle from there, or take a reusable water bottle with you to refill daily. Safety deposit box- available in the room\u2026$2 a day charge. We did see rooms that were close to the beach and they were very much smaller with no storage, a tiny washroom, and were very \u201cdated\u201d. They had \u00be beds in them and we were told that those rooms do not have larger beds unless they are ocean front for \u201choneymooners\u201d. Advantages of building 3000- quiet at night, better room amenities Disadvantages- felt like you were not a part of the resort\u2026actually have to walk back out of the lobby, out to the driveway of the hotel to get to the building\u2026you are actually walking away from the resort meeting plaza, restaurants, beach and pool to this building, it is quite far from the beach, pool area and if you like to sit on your balcony in the am and evening looking at the water (as I do!) this is not the building for you! Food- one buffet that served breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The food was good but there was not much difference between lunch and dinner offerings. There are 4 a la carte restaurants and we went to three of them. They were excellent! All of the meals were delicious. Between the 3 restaurants and a dinner out in Playa Del Carmen we had no problems with going to the buffet for 3 of the 7 nights for dinner. We always found lots to eat. There is also a snack bar down by the beach that served breakfast and lunch\u2026seemed to have a lot of the buffet food as well as hamburgers, hot dogs etc. Lots of people ate there but we didn\u2019t so cannot comment on how that was. Service- Staff was efficient, attentive, friendly and hard working. The hotel and the grounds were spotless and constantly being cleaned. We had a couple of issues with our room that needed to be attended to and they were fixed as soon as I informed the front desk. The men at the bar by the beach were excellent. They were very aware of who was waiting to order a drink and if someone stepped in would emphatically tell them to wait their turn or get in line. Beach- Beautiful soft sand, lots of beach to walk\u2026a walk down to Sr Frog\u2019s in Playa Del Carmen was about 30-35 minutes. We had several days of heavy seaweed coming into the shoreline. The water was VERY dirty and large piles of seaweed lined the shoreline those days but then it cleared up and was lovely again. The beach was being cleaned constantly and men were trying to clear away the seaweed but it was an impossible task for those days. There were plenty of beach chairs available and palapas to sit under. Entertainment- Typical lip synching performances. I did appreciate that the shows like \u201cperfect couple\u201d were all done in the afternoon poolside and the evening shows were not \u201caudience participation\u201d types of things. There seemed to be a lot of activities going on throughout the day and if you were inclined to you could be well occupied during the day. WiFi- There are 3 \u2018hot spots\u2019 in the resort\u2026.in the plaza area, by the bar at the beach, by building 3000. The wifi was terrible and extremely frustrating. The connection was difficult to get and harder to maintain. We found it simpler to pay the 25 pesos for 30 minutes and use the computers in the hotel. There were 4 computers in a small room that you could access.

There were 5 of us. 2 couples and one single. When I booked the trip I requested our single friend be accomodated next door to my husband and I. Strange but they put the other couple next to us and our single friend was put in another building. She ended up being quite happy with that as she had a bathtub in her room and a fridge. Just as well cos they didnt seem very pleased at the mention of a room change. I was very dissapointed to find no fridge in our room. I really missed having a cold beer while i was getting ready for dinner or just vegging on our deck. We bought bottled water at the vending machine or filled our travel mugs at the bar. No big deal. Take your own facecloths! I didnt like having to use the hand towels when we were lucky enough to get them. Not a real problem as I pulled the towel animal apart on the days we were not restocked. No problem with towels tho. The rooms are very clean and the beds are fine. Firm but we all had some good sleeps. The beach is wonderful! All 5 of us went parasailing for the first time. It was awesome! I highly recommend it. $40.00 apiece. Always managed to find chairs at the beach whenever we wanted some ocean time. We spent lots of time at the quiet adult pool. Loved it. The bartender was awesome! And we met some nice people from Minnesota. Speaking of people. I am absolutely astounded at the rudeness of some of the guests! I am so glad to be canadian! One bartender actually asked my friend and I if we were canadian. When we asked him how he knew he said \"you are happy and you smile a lot\". It must be terrible to have to serve the rude people that we encountered. I hate to stereotype the Europeans but they were sooooo rude. Several times while waiting in line we were butted in on. Even when we were at the front of the line ready to order! Never once did I receive a smile back. I made it a mission for a couple days to see if any of them would return a smile. NOT ONCE!! Even when a lady and i were side by side in the pool and our eyes met I smiled and she looked away with what I think might have been a grudging smile.....maybe. No wonder Canadians have such a frienly reputation :) That is not the fault of the resort tho. Just thought I would mention it to any canadians that might go there. Had a wonderful meal at the mexican restaurant! Wish we had booked twice there. The mediterranean was awesome! Had the best salmon ever. We also went to the Italian at the Aztec. 5 thumbs down. We were all dissapointed. The pasta was good tho. Our buffet was fine. On par for a 3 or 4 star. All of us always found something good to eat. Great omelettes. I even felt compelled to tip the girl. She seemed quite pleased. All in all it was a great vacation. The staff was wonderful. Don't let some of these reviews deter you from going there. It was a great vacation.

As in years past, Viva does somethings very well. First, a magnificent beach. There were plenty of lounge chairs & this year, something new - lounge security. In past years, people were out at 6 am reserving numerous chairs. Not so this year - the security gave 10 minutes & then took away the towels, hats, bag etc. If you want a chair that eary you better be prepared to stay put. This really proved to be a great improvement. Yu could get up & go to breakfast & return to the beach at 8:30 or so and there would be lounges available. After 9 ish the lounge security was done. The specialty restaurants were all delicious. A new one - Viva Cafe was excellent, even a bit upscale. We tried two at Azteca & 3 at Maya and they were all very good. The rooms ared definitely a bit tired. There also is a pervasive musty smell throughout all 3 of hotels. That said however, they are scrupulously CLEAN. Every day the staff works very hard to make sure everything is perfect. The two hotels up front near the beach are older but have LOCATION in their favor. The newer hotel on the back of the property is lovely & quieter. There is also a adult only pool back there. Another positive are the beautiful grounds. Maya is a smaller property making it easy to walk everywhere & the property is fantastically maintained. A BIG plus is the closeness to town - an easy 1/2 hour walk or 10 minute (70 pesos) cab ride. If you don't want to go into town, directly across the street is a great little shopping plaza. There's even a Starbuck's there. The buffet is ok. I have never really found a buffet that was extraordinary. There is always something to eat. People line up for pasta bar & the omlet stations. Now, the things they do wrong. The wines are beyond horrible. There are tons of fruity drinks & liquor & beer that seem to make people happy, but the wine is simply terrible. Shame on Viva for not upgrading it. Next, there is some spread they try to pass off as butter. I actually saw people bring their own tubs of Land o Lakes from the store. There are no pepper shakers on the tables. So either bring your own pepper or be prepared to summon a waiter to bring a grinder. Overall, I find it a great little place to stay.

It is still a fun family resort with caring service, good food, and as fine a beach as can be found south of Cancun. We had a wonderful time and recommend it without hesitation. To those who have previously been there, however, there are recent changes which may influence your return. For one thing, the physical facilities have deteriorated: It took us three changes of rooms before we found one that was not musty and damp. And even there, in the newest building, tiles were missing in the bathroom and a hanging blind that separated the bathroom from the bedroom was broken and would not come down. Everyday for a week we told them about it but it was never fixed. A second problem, which may be related to the first, is that the corporate management has committed itself to expanding the Vacation Club aspect of the resort, which bestows VIP status on returning club members, offering all sort of perks, including an exclusive area of the beach (which packs the rest of us into a smaller space), the buffet dining hall (where their area gets tablecloths instead of place mats), etc. A manager at the hotel told me that their main emphasis is now on expanding this area of their clientel at the expense of the regular non-VIP vacationer. And so the non-VIP-er now has to pay for use of the room safe; bottled water is no longer supplied daily; only three meals are allowed per week in the theme restaurants, etc. New construction will be for VIP people exclusively. Something else to consider, is that the non-English speaking clientel has greatly expanded. There were always many Italians (not surprising as the company is Italian), which added a sophisticated European air to the place. Today most of the guests are European and French Canadian: French, German, Swiss, Belgian, etc. The result is that you don't meet many people from 'back home'. This definitely changes the social dynamics. We still like the place, but there are many to choose from in this price range.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Canada", "Title": "\u201cJust back Feb12-19\u201d", "Author": "tracy d", "ReviewID": "UR124876375", "Content": "First trip to Playa and Viva Maya,Couldn't ask for better weather, beautiful location ,resort very centrally located,found staff to be very helpful and accommodating.

The activity staff were great, with activities readily available for those wishing to participate. The night shows were very professional and well done. Took advantage of the free scuba lesson in the pool for our 2 boys, unfortunately were not able to follow through with a dive, due to harbor master not allowing boats out because of choppy water. The dive company then, did not want to refund our money, even though it states on their policy board in the dive shop,Full Refund, if unable to reschedule due to weather/water conditions.We couldn't in our case as we were leaving the next day. They only wanted to give us 1/2 our money back, until my husband saw the sign, in regards to refunds. They then did some fast backtracking, my husband was going to give them some money for their time but, not after they tried to take advantage of us.It is no reflection on the hotel, as the dive company just rents the space there, we did make the hotel aware of the situation ,they were not happy and believe they were going to deal with it.

They do work very hard and had a bit of cirque du soliel going with a small mat underneath them to protect them. 5th avenue is a 5 min cab ride or a 30 min walk. The resort is located in a gated community which was nice for a evening stroll, never felt unsafe. We did book telum from a guy on the beach. Lesson learned it was a small van that pick us up early in the morning and picked up 8 other people going to different venues we wasted over 2 hours picking people up and dropping them off. We took the ferry to Cozumel and rented what they call are cars are drove around the island. Great way to spend the day. Do not rent a scooter if you do so. The rules to the road is not what it is like in north America. We did see a few accidents with scooters so unless you want to end up in the hospital I would rent a car.

All they need is a little moisture, like a few drops from a spilled drink or dew. Saw numerous guests with tensor bandages on their wrists, including a bride, because of slip and falls. 3000 Block, BLACK MOLD. Front desk doesn't care and you will get the run around changing rooms because you can't breathe. Only a few rooms have fridges and if your a diabetic - too bad. Sun wing will give you a styrofoam cooler you have to fill with ice yourself for your insulin. Plus you have to return the cooler for the next guest. Resorts solution? One fridge behind the front desk anyone and everyone can go into to use for medicine. Stick with the 2000 block. It is the only block that you can walk from the lobby (and the buffet restaurant) to your room in the rain and not get wet. The resort does not supply Kleenex or wash cloths so bring your own. They only supply one bottle of water every few days and you are suppose to either buy your own water from the vending machines, or bring your empty water bottle to the bar and re-fill it yourself. I also noticed that the water from the sink had a stinky smell when you first turned the tap on. You have to let it run awhile. They said we left our safe open and gave us the wrong code to open it again. The next morning someone called and woke us up telling us we shouldn't have yelled at the girl for giving us the wrong number as she was new. Are they serious? Firstly, we didn't yell and secondly, out of our group of 32 people, or 13 rooms, 7 of us \"happened\" to leave our safe open one time or another. If we weren't such a large group, we would have never realized this. In all our travels this has never happened before. Nothing was taken, or if there was it was such a small amount no one noticed. The buffet, with our large group, the buffets usually balance out with those who liked the variety and those who didn't. This was the first buffet that the majority did not like. If the boiled wieners didn't go at lunchtime, they were put on a pizza in the snack bar that evening. This should give you an idea of the quality of the food. Finally the last bad, Rude Europeans who cut in line no matter where your standing. Food line, drink lines, even if you are at the front desk asking about something, they will cut into your conversion to ask their own question. They alsodon't know when to stop wearing speedo's, bikini's or thongs. I'm sorry but if your over 60 or 20 lbs overweight, you shouldn't squeeze into these types of bathing suits. Also they should not allow the women to sunbathe topless in the walking paths. The children in our group didn't need to see the 70 year old woman's tata's everytime they went to play in the sand. The Good: The only thing good in the buffet were the desserts. I will say this resort had one of the best tasting desserts in my travels. The a la cart's weren't bad. Everyone who tried the new International Cafe thought that one was the best! The beach was fantastic. You could always find someplace to sit and relax. The ocean was great to play in. I actually found it warmer than the pool. The dive shop people were fantastic! They even helped one of our guys fulfill a dream of scuba diving, and he can't swim! The free scuba lessons are very professional and you could tell that these people took their jobs seriously. At the same time, they put the people at ease enough to have fun and not be scared.

Stayed at the Wyndham Maya because of the good reviews and the ok price, however for the price I paid at the Wyndham I could have stayed at the Riu and gotten much better (just based on previous resort experience) Our issues started at check-in, I asked if we could upgrade to the vista room (the picture was on the wall) we were told, \"sorry NO, it costs a lot\". We were both taken aback by that because who says NO when someone wants to pay more. We went to our assigned room and it was nice, modern, and very big. However it was about a 10 minute walk to the beach, so I asked for another room closer to the beach, I was again told NO, sorry. We had a fridge in our room but nothing in it, so I called to see if I could get some drinks brought for our fridge, I was told no. I went to the front desk and asked if there was any way to get drinks in the room, I was told no, but I could buy some in town and bring them back. So no drinks (alcoholic or not) in the room, whats the point of the fridge? After our first night I went to the front desk and again asked if we could change rooms because we could hear EVERYTHING that was happening in the room next door, in the hallway, everything. When our neighbours phone rang, it sounded like it was in our room, when the guy was snoring all night long, it sounded like he was in our room. Again I was told NO, but I could check again the next day. Wyndham Maya does not have: - free water!! at this all inclusive resort you are provided 1 free bottle of water upon your arrival, then if you want any more (and this is what I was told) you are welcome to purchase more bottles of water from the vending machine in the hotel, WTF! - good food, sorry but even as far as resort and buffet food go this was definitely not ideal. The fish tasted like eggs, the chicken tasted like eggs, I believe that they dip all their meat in egg before they cook it. The variety is really not there. If you have ever had to settle and each a hot dog at an all inclusive, then realized that the hot dogs they feed you are boiled turkey hot dogs, you were probably just as disappointed as me. They also have turkey ham and hamburgers that do not resemble beef - overall they do are not very accomodating, I just wanted some basic creature comforts for a place I paid a good amount of money for and was told NO more times then I can count. I have been to Playacar and stayed at various other resorts, and would rather stay at any others if the service will be the same. I will say that the waiters at the Portofino restaurant were amazing, very professional and well mannered, The bartenders were very nice and polite as well as the maid staff. The front desk and customer service staff however don't seem to grasp the concept of an 'unhappy patron'. The final kick from the Wyndham was when our shuttle was 25 minutes late and we were trying to get on it to go to the airport they wouldn't let us leave until we personally went back to the front desk to have our bracelets cut off. They need to remember that this is supposed to be a vacation for people.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "ny", "Title": "\u201cDecent Beach, Okay drinks, bad rooms, terrible food, terrible services\u201d", "Author": "xj26", "ReviewID": "UR124392913", "Content": "I am not a fan of this resort. Here are some of the low points: I asked the front desk if I should book my own travel to the airport or if they could help. They insisted that I use them and they required cash. I took out $80 USD to cover the taxi and my checking account was debited $97... it seems clear based on the interaction this is another way they are making a few extra dollars. The taxi they got for me appeared to be a 1990 Nissan Sentra. The toilet seat in our room only raised to about 15 degrees less than perpendicular - trust me this is a huge problem. Bartenders occasionally would not give us drinks on ice and only would give us pre-made drinks with crushed ice - they didn't speak english so we never got an explanation. I put bread in a toaster at 9:59. They turned off the toaster with my bread in it and told me breakfast was over. For food I settled on eggs and toast for breakfast, an odd/bad tasting hamburger-type thing for lunch and french fries. I couldn't find anything else remotely edible and the options I settled on were less than desirable. Dinner wasn't any better in general, although they did let us eat at the Wyndham Azteca one night and the steak there was good. Annoying activities coordinators. At 9:55am every morning we had to hear the teen-aged, hyper and annoying activity coordinators try to promote darts. Here's a tip - nobody plays darts in the morning, nobody is looking to play darts at the beach. I assume their jobs are somehow dependent on getting people to join the activities. Other annoying activities were loud salsa music for dancing at 12pm everyday - they do this in between the beach and the bar, walking through this area around this time is difficult. I'm not sure what the other resorts in the area are like but I assume they must be better. The only good thing to say is that the beach is roughly the same as the other resorts.

The cleaning staff was prompt and efficient. One day our safe was accidently left open and nothing was moved or removed. The buffet was acceptable with a large variety of food. The a-la-carte restaurants that we went to were Don Diego, Portofino, and Viva Cafe...all were great but it was the Viva Cafe that we were the most impressed with. We had made a request for a room with our travel agent that never was done so I called there one week before we left. Upon our arrival, I checked for our request and saw it had been noted down. Our first room was in the building we asked for but was a smoking room. We went back and requested a non-smoking room and we got it immediately. The only disappointment was that we were waiting for an upgrade room that was to be avilable, but did not happen. The beach and landscape was kept clean and tidy. Every morning, staff were raking and clearing up all sea-weed off the beach edge. The \"chair police\" were our to ensure that people did not go out and save chairs in the morning and not show up until the afternoon\". The chefs and restaurant staff did everything to ensure you were looked after and everything was safe. We witnessed the staff cleaning the pool snack bar ovens and fryers daily. The one thing that really impressed me that there were signs arounf the food showing \"no hands\" on the foods and to use the utensils provided, and this was enforced. I personally watched an American family Reach in and grab some pizza while talking about how it was not as good as the pizza they get back home in New York-- quickly followed by the Chef asking them if they could not read the signs. After a few rude comments from the family-- they left and the chef removed the pizzas thanks to them. There were plenty of activities to keep you occupied if you wanted, and quiet areas to relax. The resort staff were kept busy all day and night and talking to a few of them, all seemed to enjoy what they were doing. The bartenders were quick to serve and very professional. The only 2 areas that were found to be a problem. Firstly was the ladies working in the hotel store. When we were in there, they seemed that they would rather be talking to each other rather than helping you. The other area was the time-share( Viva Vacation). Like others-- they promise a short meeting-- but we heard from others that it actually took HOURS. We will definately be going back again-- you can not beat the service and you get to stay at a great resort for a fair value.

The buffets were typical upscale all-inclusive resorts, with the ups and downs of large quantities of food being produced for a large amount of people. Overall the buffet was quite good! The location of the hotel is awesome. It's very close Playa Del Carmen, which you must visit at least once while here. It was a short taxi ride right to the hottest restaurants in town. The hotel hooked us up with an all-inclusive dinner in town at the nicest looking restaurant around. I'm not sure if they still do that but it's worth asking. My favourite excursions were the Xel-Ha and Tulum excursions arranged through the hotel. You can get cheaper excursions elsewhere but we wanted to deal with the hotel so didn't mind spending the extra couple of bucks. I wouldn't come to the area without checking out Xel-Ha.

In fact, we had such an incredible time once again, that we are not only returning next year, but we will be extending our stay to two weeks. The resort was as beautiful as I remembered it. It is located right on the beach and although it is a large resort, it does not extend away from the beach as far back as some of the surrounding resorts do, meaning that you will always be within a short walk to the beach no matter which part of the hotel you are staying in. The grounds are stunning, making the walks to the restaurants and to the beach such a pleasure. The beach is so beautiful and it is hard to take our minds off it, now that we are back home. The sand is white and soft like flour and the color of the water is just spectacular. There are lots of palapas and lounge chairs and we never had a hard time finding seating on the beach. There are fun activities on the beach all throughout the day such as latin dance classes, aqua aerobics, sports and other fun games and the instructors are wonderful. The rooms were once again very clean and well maintained. The food was also great. Lots of variety and tasty (the grilled fish is amazing!). The resort's proximity to the town of Playa del Carmen was also something we found to be great. The resort is located within a 15-20 min. walk along a wonderful boulevard framed by beautiful Mexican villas and stunning vegetation. The town itself is very charming, entertaining and great for shopping. And last but not least, who could forget the resort's wonderful staff!?! Just like last year, the staff was friendly, courteous and heart warming.

Third room was the charm and enjoyed the rest of our vacation. The Viva Wydham has one of the best locations on the beach. If you like long walks on a white sandy beach then you will love this place. The buffet dining was full of variety, freshness and flavour. There was something for everyone. The waiters were always friendly and helpful. You are allowed 3 a-la-carte reservations for a one-week stay. I would advise booking any a-la-carte dining as soon as you arrive because they fill up quickly. We had booked three meals however were late for the Mediterranean reservation so we just ate at the buffet. No big loss, the buffet was fantastic. Both the Mexican and Japanese (sister hotel Aztec) meals were excellent. There was a good variety of drinks that were not watered down. Try a mango marguerita. Mexico has a lot to see and do so you will never be bored, unless you want to be. Overall, Viva Wydham is not a 5 star however good value for your money.

During the day the entertainment staff would be in the dining area sitting with the guests or organizing a contest by the pool. There was plenty of food at all times.

We have stayed in this Mexico and in particular the Playa del Carmen many times. This resort was very nice and very affordable. Room ( we stayed in 1343 ) - The room was very small and did not have a fridge or a mini bar. The maids left us two bottles of water and a few sodas every day. We asked her to just leave us water, which was a great idea. We got all the soda we wanted at the bars, but it was great to have bottled water. The room was clean and had a very nice, modern bathroom. The beds were small and hard. We asked our maid for a mattress cover, and she got us one. It made a world of difference. The room was on the far north (?) side of the resort. We were right next to the kitchen of the neighboring hotel. It was occasionally noisy, but after about 10:30 pm the noise stopped. Besides our loud neighbors, we didn't hear a sound! Beach - The beach was incredible. Great in every way. We had a few days of very strong waves. There is a little bit of a drop off, but it wasn't an issue. Loved the beach! Lots of walking in each direction. There are a lot of topless women in this area. Oh well. A lot of the suits these days may as well be topless. Pool - There really is only one pool area, which was disappointing. There is a \"relaxing\" pool, but since we were with kids we could not use it. The main pool area was fun. The activity staff kept things interesting. Not a lot of loud music, which we have experienced at other resorts. Overall, very nice pool. Dining - We loved the buffet. It was the best Mexican buffet we have had while traveling. A pasta bar every night! Loved having that option. Especially for the kids. We also LOVED the Mexican restrauant \"Don Diego\". Wow! Incredible food. We enjoyed \"Portofino\" and \"Viva Cafe\" as well. We never tried the Italian restraunt because we loved Don Diego's so much we kept going back. We typically had the pool area snack bar for lunch, which was decent. I really enjoyed the thin crust pizza with tomatoes. Very good. Drinks - This place does not water down their drinks! Try the Mojito's. Yum! Shows - We only saw a few of the shows. The Comedy Games were super funny. The kids Disney show was fun since our kids took part in it. The shows are supposed to start at 9:30 pm but usually didn't start until close to 10:00. We are early risers, so by 10:00 we were exhausted after playing in the sun all day! Kids Club - My kids are at the top of the range to attend the Kids Club. But we still had them go so that they could \"have a break from their parents.\" They really seemed to enjoy their time at the club. The staff were really great and went out of their way to make sure my kids enjoyed themselves. Complaints - They do not have pool or beach drink service, which is strange considering they have workers out collecting the empty cups. It seems it would be just as easy to bring full drinks out and take back the empties. Boo Hoo! Poor me! Have to get up and get myself a drink! LOL. Also, I am addicted to the internet and email. The wi-fi sucks. I had to keep turning it off and on. I know, I was on vacation. But I like to share pictures and keep in touch with the \"real world\" especially because we were there for so long. I am sure there are things that I am forgetting to tell you. Overall, this is one of the better resorts we have stayed at. It is a very nice, typical Mexican resort. I always tell people that in Mexico, you get out of it what you want. If you go looking for a good time, you will have it. If you go looking for problems, you are going to find those as well. We went looking to have a nice, relaxing vacation and that was exactly what we found.

Some of the best aspects are the following: very nice beach, good drinks, good nightly entertainment, beautiful grounds, nice rooms, and good restaurants. The hotel is in a great location. It is nice that it is located within the gated Playacar community because you feel safe to leave the resort and explore. Also, the hotel is a short cab ride or long walk (20 minutes or so) to Playa Del Carmen. We were really surprised at how nice Playa Del Carmen is. There are lots of shops, restaurants, and bars there. The only negative thing was that we could only make 3 reservations at the restaurants during our week stay. So we ate at the buffet the other 4 nights. My family was dissapointed with the buffet overall. However, the salad bar is really good. There is also a station where you can get a variety of pasta dishes every night: the pasta was the best food at the buffet. Overall the buffet food is what we normally experience at all-inclusive resorts. We also enjoyed the kayaks and catamarans. They will take you out on the catamarans at certains times. At other times you can take lessons or use them on your own. We went to the Tulum ruins during our trip and I would highly recommend going there. We took a collectivo (van) from Playa Del Carmen to the ruins for just $3 each way per person. It was also about $3 per person admission. So this was a very cheap excursion.

I've been to several all inclusive resorts all over Mexico and this was was all around pretty good. The staff was wonderful and always very helpful and polite. The hotel was always very clean. The shows are really fun and entertaining. The staff always wanted to get everyone involved. The bartenders were great, I've never had such strong drinks at an all inclusive before usually they are watered down but it they were really good and had a huge variety. Our room was nice and clean. The bed was average as far has hotel beds go, Its a hotel... its not going to be as comfortable as your bed at home. A review below warns people about not having a fridge/iron/clock etc. but my room did. We did only get one bottle of water, which we just refilled downstairs at the bar (not a big deal though). We always had fresh towels and the maids were good. The food was good. Again not the best food I've ever had but I never went hungry and there was always something to munch on. I think the main dinner buffet area could be bigger (size wise) it always felt cramped and there were always line ups, I always felt I was walking into people. There was a lot of variety of foods though and the waiters were always nice and eager to give you coffee or a drink. The snack bar was really good during the day but late night it was lacking, they put all the good stuff away and it felt like it was leftovers from dinner. We went to 3 a la carte restaurants the Italian, International and Mexican. All were really good it was a nice change from the buffet. There were a lot of very rude Europeans however. Which turned me off. They always cut in line and crowd you out. Obviously that isn't the hotels fault, it was just annoying to my husband and I. The hotel was a decent walk from 5th Ave about 30 min, but it was a beautiful walk. Lots of trees/flowers and a nice sidewalk. I would definitely recommend the Viva Wyndham Maya. I'm not sure if I would go back just because I like to do something different each trip.

I have to admit they had me worried before I came, but having had the experience I can honestly say we had a wonderful time. We stayed for 2 weeks - Dec 17 - 31st. We have 2 small children 2 and 3, but were also traveling with family - so in total there was 14 of us. One has to keep in mind this is a 3* resort and the cheapest - so we found it FANTASTIC value for money. Checkin: We were given a room in the 3000 block after specifically requesting a close room to the beach. At first I thought, \"Here we go - terrible vacation.\" But the staff were wonderful about giving us options, and because we had little kids we decided to stay in the 3000 block and avoid the noise of the nightly show. The 3000 block was close to the bikes, gym and tennis court and was quiet. Pool: We didn't spend a lot of time at the pool as the kids area wasn't huge, and the adult relax pool was awesome for kids (but kids weren't allowed). The kids loved the beach and the ocean - so we were happiest there. Gym: The gym was great and I went everyday while the kids napped at 2:30pm so it was empty. There was also a staff member there to help if you needed it. Tennis: This was awesome. We were able to play everyday and the racquets were not half bad. Beach: This is where we spent all of our time. It was busy - but we were always able to get chairs as long as we came down by 10:30am. The boogie boards were fun and so was the hobie cats. We also walked down to the end where there are no resorts and you could swim off shore and there were tons of fish (although they were a bit too friendly). Food: I am not sure what people are complaining about. The food was good, maybe not amazing but good. No one got sick and everyone found food that they liked. We had lovely dinners at the Don Diego and the Portofino. Yes, getting reservations was not as easy as one may like, but sometimes it is like that when you are making reservations in your own home town. Not one of us got sick either! The staff worked so hard to make sure the food was fresh. Yes, some things I didn't like, but taste varies so much in food, and there was always something good. Bars: The bars were great and very kind to make my kids fruit smoothies! Staff: Wow! Did they work hard, and were always so pleasant. The staff work 14 hour days, including putting on the show at night. All the staff always said Ola and were friendly and busy! We were so impressed with the staff and would give them a 5* rating. Rooms: Clean and it was great to have the huge jetted tub too. *these were in the 3000 block which is the newer building, but further from the beach. Our kids were included in the KIDS CLUB if we participated. Next time they will be old enough. The head of Kids Club was amazing and was so genuine with the kids. Safety: We always felt safe - and the road around the golf course was a great run and the bike path into town was perfect (10 minutes). It was nice to be at a resort that was close to town to add to the variety. Would highly recommend Cozumel. We also took our kids to Xcharet - which was great for them and the show at night was very well done. Take a taxi for 150 pesos and just pay the admission. So much cheaper as the tours charge you $20 per person just to get the bus there and back. Also, if you are a seasoned traveller just take the bus from the bus depot in Playa del Carmen.

The good thing is, we accomplished what we went there to accomplish, which was overall relaxation (a break away from our toddler son). However, we ended up facing one issue after another with the hotel, which made us overall disappointed with the hotel and their services. 1) We booked an all-inclusive resort because we wanted the luxury of not having to think about anything and we liked the idea of going to different restaurants on-site or at the neighboring Viva Wyndham Azteca, all included. We did our research, which clearly indicates that the a la carte restaurants are part of what is included. Upon booking, we confirmed this with the hotel, and they specifically told us that the restaurants were included for every night. No one once said that you are limited to a certain number of restaurant reservations at the hotel. For example, if you stay 5-6 nights, you are limited to only 2 reservations at their restaurants. We found this out upon arrival at the hotel. Knowing that we would be eating at the buffet restaurant breakfast and lunch every day, we had our hopes set on enjoying a more peaceful dinner in the evenings at a restaurant on-site. So that was disappointing. We did argue with the person there that makes the reservations and she granted us 1 more reservation in the end. She said to us that because there are so many guests, they have to limit the reservations. And while she was making them, she led us to believe that all the restaurants were so full and it was so hard to get in to the restaurants we wanted. Then we found out that at each reservation we went to, the restaurants were practically empty! Why was she lying? Were they actually booked and then people were just not showing up? At each restaurant we went to, only 3 tables were full the whole time. As our vacation progressed, we started to realize that the food was being repeated/recycled from the buffet over to the restaurants, and the quality was quite poor. We actually ended up ditching our 3rd reservation once we found out how bad the food is after all! So all that complaining only to learn that it wasn't even worth the reservations. Plus, our last reservation was New Year's Eve, which was a set menu. When we saw the menu, on it was a dish I had already had at another one of their restaurants the night before! What? I came to enjoy variety and quality in food, and this was just incredibly disappointing. So we ended up going into town the last 2 nights, which turned out to be our best meals the entire trip. 2) As I touched on in my previous point about reservations, the food is repetitive, not so great, and I think the ingredients they use are awful. The mozzarella on their pizza for example...is not mozzarella. At least not real mozzarella. The Mexican food was just fine, however. Not the best, but we were able to survive on tortilla chips, pico de gallo, salsa picante, and tacos. Sadly, I've had better Mexican in the U.S. (and I was even craving some of the Mexican food I know I can get in Washington, DC). In general though, if you stuck with what Mexico does well with, you are fine. At times, the food in general was mediocre at best. Do NOT go to this resort if you are a foodie. 3) Unless you are all about activities and the \"cruise ship on land\" experience, this is not the best hotel to go to for an \"escape\" and for peace and quiet. There is always a DJ babbling away over some pool competition (though there is a quiet adult pool in the back of the hotel), and salsa lessons out by the pool, and all kinds entertainment going on at the theater at night up until 11pm (even later for New Year's). And most of the rooms are facing the theater, so if you are unlucky enough, you will feel the base vibrating in your room at night. So every night we had to fall asleep to some sort of performance. New Year's was almost unbearable...they definitely cranked up the volume for that and made it go until 2 am. I don't know what the guests with babies and young children did...I felt sorry for them. 4) Wake-up call. Called the front desk for a 6:45 am wake-up call, which was confirmed and clearly stated that the call would take place at 6:45 am. (The person at the desk spoke fluent English.) We got the call at 4:45 am. Thanks guys. 5) We got a complimentary bottle of water the first 2 days in the hotel and after that, they stopped bringing water. Not sure if you get a maximum of only 2 bottles or what. Also, we had a coffee maker in our room the first day, and then they took it during cleaning...never got it back. Weird, but at least you could get coffee elsewhere. 6) The hotel recommended that we use them for our transportation to and from the airport. On pick-up from the airport, all went well. The driver was there with our name and a van. They told us to confirm our transport to the airport 2 days prior to departure, which we did and all was fine. They were to pick us up at 9:30 am so we could get checked-in at the airport by 10:30 am for a 12:30 pm flight. At 9:45, no one has shown and the hotel staff is scrambling and frantically making phone calls, assuring us the driver was on his way and that we were the only people to be picked up, so we would head straight to the airport. Finally, at 9:50, a taxi pulls up and the driver has our name and flight details. So we go with him and he says he has to stop at Viva Azteca to pick up 2 more people. Okay...so the hotel lied about us being the only customers being picked up. But what we think happened is that the actual driver (who was not a taxi cab driver) didn't show, so they convinced this other taxi driver to come by and pick us up too, in addition to these other guests. So we go to Azteca and wait and wait and those guests never show. We know we are going to be late, so the driver just takes us to the airport and of course, on the way, we get a flat tire. Fortunately, our driver was pretty savvy and had that tire changed within minutes. Disaster avoided. 7) Overall -- Viva Wyndham Maya (and I assume by default, Viva Wyndham Azteca) makes it very obvious that they are saving costs. That's understandable, however, it is so blatant that they are being cheap and cutting corners...most noticeably with the food. Between the quality and the recycling/repeating of their food in the buffet and restaurants, you can see that they are trying to keep costs down. I get that hotels can and should try to keep costs down, but when you pay a lot of money to go on a vacation to relax and be spoiled and not have to worry about anything, you don't want to see the \"cheapness\" right in front of you. At least pretend, Wyndham! People want to feel like they are on vacation...not like they are eating at a cafeteria at a public high school. It was like a cattle call too sometimes...how crazy the buffet restaurant (aka cafeteria) was and how mediocre to poor the food was. And the restaurants and reservation limits...ugh. So we did relax the beach was lovely, water was aquamarine blue (though not too warm to really want to swim in, same with the pools). The atmosphere in most parts of the hotel was pleasant. The staff were for the most part courteous and friendly. Some of the front-desk people seemed a little stand-offish, and definitely the lady who makes the restaurant reservations really had an attitude. But the best part of our trip was leaving the hotel to go into town! Better food, more interesting, better shopping, etc. We did take a trip to Tulum, which was lovely and scenic and interesting. It would have been more worth the money to stay at a non-inclusive resort for the sake of increasing the chances of having better food. I place so much emphasis on food because my husband and I are foodies and part of what we love about vacationing is enjoying great meals.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWas actually surprised how good value it was\u201d", "Author": "ToRiuBambu", "ReviewID": "UR122796367", "Content": "We stayed in Viva Wyndham Maya VWM resort from Dec 29th for 9 days. To be honest we did not expect much from this vacation - we were on the budget and traveled during most expensive time for Canadians - kids winter break and New Years. I originally looked into booking Riu Yucatan resort, but that resort was exactly twice as much expensive as VWM for the same days. So knowing that I paid so much less, I was not expecting much. But I was wrong - we had a very good vacation. In March 2011 I stayed in Riu Yucatan and in Dec 2010 I stayed in Riu Tequila, so I will try to compare VWM resort to these Rius. But all members of our family agreed - our vacation and VWM resort was better than at these RIUs and I believe that VWM has better value for OUR family vacation, considering what is important to us. Even with the same price we would book VWM over RIU Yucatan and Tequila, but actually VWM is cheaper family resort. Your family might have different priorities and that might not be true for you, so please keep reading this review. Beach Beach at VWM was better than at Riu Yucatan - you were allowed to have beds much closer to the water, there were palapas. But the beach was a bit more crowded. There were not enough sun beds a VWM for people who arrived after 9am, but that was not a problem for us - we were at the beach before 8am. Rooms We stayed away from the beach - in the block 3000 and our room was very quiet. I do not remember another resort were I could sleep without earplugs, but I was able to do that VWM. Room was very big with all basic things one would expect. There was no fridge with drinks (as in Riu resorts), but that was no problem for us. From the noise perspective rooms in the building 1000 are the worst. Rooms facing inside of the resort would hear noise from night entertainment inside VWM. Rooms facing outside in that block would hear noise from nearby Riu Playascar (I believe) resort. Rooms in building 2000 facing outside resort looked quiet, but I am not sure about that. So again, to me rooms in block 3000 at VWM was much quieter than in Riu hotels. One big problem in VWM rooms - pillows. I have never ever seen such thin pillows. Even if you put 2 of them together, you could not call that thing a pillow. I wrapped 2 pillows in the towel and maid myself bigger pillow, but resort should take care of such silly problem.. I did like a fact that there was just 1 water bottle in the room. I understand that resort should not give you drinks in the room, but if your water from the tap can make one sick when used to brush teeth, I believe it is resort responsibility to provide enough water for teeth brushing. So I was doing what most of other guests did - got water from the bars. I saw very few people buying water from their dispensing machines. Drinks Again, comparing to Rius I found them better and VWM. Not by much, but they were stronger and consistently better. Entertainment Nightly entertainment was better at Rius. That was very visible to me, but that was not a big problem to me. I believe RIUs have special teams who did nightly shows (or most of them), and at VWM the same animation team members who keeps us busy during the day were doing all the dancing at night. During the day we did not participate much in anything, but I noticed one big different. At Rius all animation team members were constantly hitting at hotel guests and that was always visible. I have not seen such thing at VWM - these guys/girls were busy doing their job. Food This part is a bit harder to explain. Based on many reviews I was expecting bad food. But that was not really the case. I would describe my experience like this - \"there was a lot of bad food there, but for every meal I found something that I liked and enjoyed\". I used to come to all inclusive resorts and would try to eat a bit of everything. But now I just take 2-3 different dishes and do not overeat. And VWM was perfect for that. But clearly VWM had much less space for food presentation, so food did not looked that fancy. One night they had lobster and I did not see it till I noticed it on other people plates. Lobster was not presented specially, it was there just \"buy the way\". Clearly at RIUs restaurants were much bigger and looked fancier and food was presented better. But again I was happy what I got at VWM. I also enjoyed a la carte dining at VWM more (service and food quality) and found that it was better at VWM comparing to RIUs. VWM has less choice for deserts and fruit comparing to RIUs, but it was just very marginal difference. New Years At 5pm VWM had European New Years countdown - were people from Europe got sparkling wine and did countdown and kissing. That night all a la carte restaurants have same food - soup, salmon, lobster with steak. Then at 7pm close to lobby bar there were nice deserts and more cocktails. That night show was at 10pm and around 11pm everybody got a \"Happy New Year\" had horn and there was music. Then before 12pm everybody got sparkling wine and there was countdown and then more dancing. I think New Years party was nicely organized and had a good atmosphere. Surroundings Out of 3 resorts I liked Riu Yucatan the best. That is because Yucatan had monkey family living there and it was always fun to watch them in the trees. At Riu Tequila they had these long tail raccoon/cat looking animals that would follow you around if you had some food. And that was fun too. vWM had few aqotis (?) and some lizards, but nothing special. RIUs hotels lobbies looks much more impressive comparing to VWM. Other There were few other small things that made VWM better resort for us. For example: - at Riu resorts you could not bring coffee to beach, but at the VWM they have a bar open at least at 7am that would serve you coffee in plastic bags that you can take to beach. We would not drink our coffee at the breakfast, but would have it at the beach - what a perfect way to start your day. Also bars for drinks at VWM would open much earlier that RIUs. - at Riu resorts they would open towel hut just from 8am. For us \"early risers\" that was always a problem, especially as often they did not have enough towels evening before.

Our room had a mini fridge, though they do not stock it at this resort. We bought water and pop from a convenience store across the street from the resort and kept them in the fridge. Our experiences at the a la carte restaurants was very positive. We booked our three reservations the day we arrived. We ate at both the Portofino (Mediterranean) and Miramare (Italian) and thoroughly enjoyed both. The buffet offered something for everyone, so we never went hungry. The hot chocolate that they serve at breakfast is excellent!

If you are an obnoxious european chain smoker, who dresses head to toe in designer gear with loud brassy labels so everyone know just how important you are, then you will love it here. If you prefer not to be surrounded by clouds of cigarette smoke, and watch the entire resort used as an ashtray- the go somewhere else. I have never seen so many discarded cigarette butts, in the sand, the hallways and yes, even in the ocean, an I did when I stayed here. One day we watched an older woman enter the pristine caribbean ocean with a smoke hanging from her mouth, take a couple of puffs and then throw it in the ocean. Another day an entire family entered the ocean with a loaf of bread and broke it apart to feed to the non existent fish, we had to get out of the water as we were soon surrounded by soggy chunks of bread all around us. Other than these rude and chain smoking visitors, the resort was lovely and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The food was great and the drinks were fine. My husband tipped the over worked bartenders every time we ordered drinks and they seemed to appreciate this- apparently tipping and saying thank you or gracias is not used in some parts of the world. Back to the reason for writing this review- we were looking into the Wyndham in Bayahibe Dominican and after reading similar reviews and realizing that it is also itlalian owned and that all of the shows were exclusively in italian- figured out quickly which crowd they were catering to, and have decided to vacation elsewhere.

We have 7 and 3 years old children and I'm glad for one thing only - that we've made out of there alive. The room and the ground tiles were very slippery after the rain one of my kids fell and heart his head on it. Fire ants nest was in the middle of the reception plaza and 2 little kids including my kid were terrified when ants got under their clothes in hundreds. It was the worst moment of my parenting life. My 7 years old and one more child were left in the sea unsupervised by the kids club member - they were just forgotten there. Food and watered down beverages made my already slim 3 year old loose some weight, we all returned home just looking ill instead of rested. Room : We paid for all inclusive, but there were only two small water bottles on arrival day and nothing in the fridge. That's it. We were going to the buffet 2-3 times a day to refill our kids travel bottles - it was an unwanted chore. Our used towels were refolded and given to us several times. How did I knew it? My makeup stains were in the same corners where I used it. During the rain water were running along the cord of the light fixture - we let resort know about it - it wasn't fixed. Furniture and grass chair were mouldy. Bathroom sealing cracked open after the rain revealing the black mould - it was fixed only on the last day of our stay. Bathroom shower head and ventilation wasn't working. Our room at night was noisy from the neighbour resort's Air Conditioning . Service just nonexistent. This resort catering for someone who 's vacation goal is to get heavily hammered - that's it. As a family person I was offended by so much alcohol variety and nothing for someone like me when we came out for a walk in the evening. When we asked for a tea, we were given a hot water and some bad attitude - even that after skipping our turn several times and hot water for tea were ready to go from the moment we asked. But that's is just a bed service. The worst thing that this resort is plain dangerous : slippery floors, electrical fixtures exposed to water,fire ants , black mould , build unsafe - bathroom sink fell out leaving my family member with a blue toe. We were rightfully expected apology for those things - it never came. Worst experience abroad.Not for families with smaller or older kids. P.S.: Must say that three,four resort's staff members were amazing people who despite all the downs of working place tried to make it good experience for us.Thank you guys for your beautiful personalities.

The location is ideal. Centrally located on the beach, it was about a 20 minute walk down the beach to Playa delCarmen and the ferry to Cozumel. The water was beautiful but it was windy almost everday...we went the end of November into December. We had a room in the 3000 block which was nice, but I would have liked a coffee maker in the room....oh well, it jus made us get up earlier and enjoy the warm weather sooner. If you play tennis, you'll want to stay in the 3000 block as the courts are on the roof of the building. It was also quieter there and very handy when we walked back from town after doing some shopping, since it is closer to the street. The gym and archery are also right next to the 3000 block. And the relax pool has a small little bar next to it, so we spent a good deal of time right there when we wanted some quiet time. Less wind, less people, less noise when you wanted it. Food at the buffet was very good, and they had a different theme everyday, although most days they had a lot of the same things out. The Mexican ala carte at Maya was excellent. The Italian restaurant at Azteca was not as good, but still enjoyable. Went to the ruins at Coba and that was an awesome experience. Apparently it is the only pyramid that you can still climb to the top and the view was spectacular. The trip up to the top was a leg work out. lol Afterwards we went for a swim in cenote, rappeling, and zip-line and then a meal in a Mayan village. The people were very friendly and genuine.

They are usually reserved for time share owners, but if they are not being used you can get into one. That building is pretty far from the rest of the action though. I had a massage at the spa and it was amazing. The food at the buffet was awesome!! We were even kind of disappointed that we had an a la carte reservation the last night instead of being able to eat at the buffet. I love mexican food and so does my husband so we were in heaven. The other types of food didn't seem all the great to me, but I really didn't try them. The pasta bar is average and the egg bar is pretty good. The mexican restaurant is incredible and the mayan restaurant at Azteca is awesome too! The italian at Azteca was our least favorite and it still wasn't bad. We rented a car and traveled all over the area, right down to Tulum. There are tons of Cenote parks to see. We did not go to the big ones like xcaret and xel ha as we thought they were too touristy. We did take a tour to Chitzen Itza and it was a great experience, but a very far drive (3 hours each way). Playa del Carmen and Playa Car are very safe. We walked all over and drove all over and never felt unsafe at all. Walmart in Playa del Carmen is a good place to go to get an idea of what things should cost in the markets. The market across from the resort is very overpriced. We went to Akumal beach and swam with the turtles too. You can take a collectivo(bus) or a taxi if you don't have a car. Its about 30 minutes south on the highway and the collectivo will drop you off right at the entrance. You can rent snorkel gear right on the beach and just swim out there. It was awesome. We saw turtles so close up! We also went to the Jungle Place. It is a spider monkey sanctuary. It was incredible. You actually get to sit in the habitat with the monkeys and feed them and pet them. The owners take pictures for you too. Well worth it! The most amazing thing we did was go to Coco Bongos! That place will blow your mind! It is a dance club, but they put on vegas style shows every 5-10 minutes. So many to name, but a few were, Lady Gaga, Madonna, Elvis, Chicago, The Mask, Spiderman, Tron, Michael Jackson, GNR, Beatlejuice. If you pay the extra $ to get the private booth it is well worth it. We had our own waiter and were not in the craziness of the crowd below. We had a table that we could sit at and a space to stand/dance in too that wasn't crazy crowded. Its also elevated so you can see the shows better. All in all the vacation was absolutely amazing!

I went alone with my 3 1/2 years old son. When we went, the kids play area was being renovated and we were given a room in the building adjacent to that area. If you have young kids, you do not want to be that far from the beach. We asked to change room because of the noise as well as the distance from the beach. The room was very nice but smelled as the air conditionning had not been turned on. The balcony was ridiculously small, the chair barely fitted on it; I guess you'd have to put your feet up if you wanted to stay outside. We were given another room on the ground floor closer to the beach. As some people have said before, if you have a room facing the outside of the complex, it is a bit noisy as the employees go by with racks and all other kind of stuff all the time. Anyways, the room was big and it was very clean. The food was good. Antonio in the dinning room was amazing. I truly felt like they were happy to have kids around. We went once to the mexican restaurant; the food was delicious, the atmosphere more luxurious, the personnel wonderful. The activities were similar from one day to the next but we didn't really care. ** 2 tips if you are travelling with young kids** : 1- If you go to Playa Del Carmen (which is very nice and safe by the way), have a stroller or take a taxi 2- If you do go to XCaret, do the water activities or else, rent a stroller as the park is enormous and little legs get tired pretty quickly! I wish the advisor with whom we booked the excursion to XCaret at the hotel would have told us that. By the way, if you book the excursion at the hotel, it will be the same price as on the site, so skip the line and book it ahead. Overall we had a wonderful vacation, people were really friendly. Oh yes, we had book our vacation with Sunwing and there was suppose to be a representant there but somehow, we never saw him!! In 7 days.. Disapointing.... One last thing, ask the reception to find that representant before you leave so you can book your airplane seats. Since we didn't know about it or saw the representant, we didn't do it and it took us seriously 20 minutes at the airport to get it settled as all the seats were booked already.

The buffet food so much better than expected from the reviews still unsure what people expect for their peso. There was so much choice definately something for everyone. The Mexican restaurant was fabulous made to feel very special, enjoyed the Mirimare too but service not quite up to Don Diego. There was always something to eat somewhere and the barmen could not serve the cocktails fast enough there was no waiting. Location brilliant pleasant walk to 5th Avenue Palya Del Carmen. Would definately advise going to see Chitzen Itza and swimming with dolphins.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado Springs, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cFirst class vacation\u201d", "Author": "DalNKat", "ReviewID": "UR119768791", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Viva Wyndham- Maya.

A group of us were there to attend a dear friends wedding. What can I say - Lets start with the Wedding - OMG Marco the wedding planner did an amazing job! The area that was set aside for the special day was beautiful! The other guests were kept back at a respectable distance allowing for family and friends to feel that there was a lovely intimacy about the ceremony - and the finishing touches were amazing, from a traditional Mexican wedding cake that was to die for, champagne service at the beach and butterflies for each guest to release with a good wish for the Bride & Groom. The resort itself is a nice compact size, you won't lose each other here (unless of course you want to - lol) A lovely quiet Adult pool along with a family pool with a swim up bar. The beach was pristine - very very well maintained. The rooms were clean and housekeeping did an excellent job - we had towel critters every day! The front end staff were very helpful and glad to be so - the guest services girls were exceptional - special thanks to Dennise who not only found me an emergency dentist but went out and got my perscription for me herself!!!! Talk about above and beyond. Bartenders and serving staff were also outstanding - with special accommodations for Eder - a wonderfully attentive bartender with a memory that had me dumbfounded! There were dive boats available on the resort for booking tours snorkeling and diving - well worth the money in my opinion. The excursions that are available along this strip were all well worth the time.

We too did our homework prior to choosing the Viva Wyndham Maya, read most of the reviews, determined to go in with an open mind, and were absolutely estatic that in the end, we choose the Maya! We are used to staying in 5 star accomodations when we travel in Canada, and were not dissapointed in the resort at all ~ now let me qualify that by saying it is not the Waldorf, however it was clean clean clean,~ the rooms were comfortable, more than large enough, and considering we were there to hang out in the sun, enjoy the ocean swimming, relax by the pool, see the sights etc...the rooms were more than adequate! We had a flat screen TV, our daughter misplaced her wallet in the room after one of our shopping excursions, and our maid after cleaning our room, left it on the bed for her, and not a thing was missing and she had well over $500USD. The staff were gracious and helpful, at all times, always smiling, always saying hello, again we didn't have one unpleasant or unsavory experience with any of the staff at all. The entertainment staff, are simply top notch, while they may not be broadway performers, the quality of the shows they put on most especially after spending the entire day trying to engage the guests in activities such as dancing, salsa lessons, bingo, volleyball tourny's, kids club etc....again, simply impressive! Their enthusiasm never seemed to wane, so kudos to them for doing so well! I also have to mention the food, again after reading the reviews I was expecting to \"just get by\", however the selection was impressive, especially for a buffet, always several options..various Mexican dishes, beef, fish and chicken always available, a variety of salads along with fresh fruits and veggies, eggs how you want them cooked, at breakfast everyday, bacon, sausage, lentils, yogurt, cereals, breads, deserts etc ~ there was so much food all the time and it was good food. Again the restaurant was always clean, the hot food hot, and the cold, cold! The liqour provided was always premium brands and no concerns with the quality of that service either.

We looked at lots of vacation destinations and decided it was time to visit Mexico again. We have visited Mexico only once before in Cancun and were hoping for a little more relaxing (read not college party town) this time. We found a few hotels that were in our budget but are always weary without checking TripAdvisor first. Some of the reviews were quite good, while others were quite bad. I can now tell you that most of the bad reviews, if not all, are from people who just let the smallest things ruin their vacation. I, for one, cannot understand how people go on vacation and have such a miserable time because everything is not perfect or what they are used to. If you don't want to experience new things, do us all a favor and just stay home. But I digress... We arrived at the Maya at check in time. I had already emailed the resort and noted that we were hoping for a ocean view. They did not disappoint as we were in room 1108 only 3 rooms literally from the end of the building on the beach. We had a balcony that was right next to the beach, the bar, the pool, all-in-all it was a great location. Check in was fast, baggage guys were friendly. We had a tour the next day so we just lounged around for the rest day (Want a great tour -- go with Mayans' Explorers, wow they are great). Here is my take on the negatives people have posted thus far: We read reviews about rudeness at check-in or with the staff arranging reservations at the restaurants. The only rudeness I saw was with the guests! All the staff were so nice, but I suppose a smile can go a long way when you deal with rude people all day. We had no problem getting multiple reservations for our 6 night stay. Reviews regarding house keeping, the \"bottled water\" issue, and cleanliness are absurd. Our room was clean, the bathroom was really updated, and we received new water, soda, etc. every day. We had towel animals every night, the staff even folded any clothes they found and left them neatly in the closet! Surprising how far a few dollars can go to staff who deserve it anyway. They are trying to be more green so they limit the amount of plastic (water bottles and straws) they use -- stop hating on them for trying to be better guardians of our planet, geez. The buffet (open air), the restaurants, the staff were great. The pasta bar at the buffet is literally out of this world. My wife and I actually skipped out on our last night at a restaurant just so we could eat at the buffet. The breakfast food was great, lunch was awesome by the pool, dinner varied every night -- the staff was attentive and kind. The buffet is open aired but when we went it wasn't bad. I mean really your in the tropics on vacation, enjoy the warmth! The restaurants were fun/good, we are not used to 5 course meals so I was pretty full every night. All the food was above our standards but I suppose we are not the type who scrutinize everything. The location is incredible, the beach was great, water is clear/turquoise and very warm. The entertainment staff do a great job of getting people involved. We did not really go to the shows but could hear them from our balcony. They looked pretty top notched especially since this are the same people who have been running around all day trying to get people to have fun. All in all, don't let the bad reviews stop you from going. Although the Maya is not a 5 star resort, if you want 5 star then stay at a 5 star! If you want friendly staff, good food, brand name alcohol (Captain, Malibu, etc.), and a relaxing time go for the Maya. The price is right and it did not let my wife or I down at all. To be really honest we were so used to such kind and warm people at the Maya the trip back on US Airlines shocked us back into how rude and inconsiderate most Americans end up being.

We stayed 5 nights, and rooms are not huge, but ours was kept very clean. The maids and staff were really nice and did a great job. Awesome shower! One thing you have to know about this area is the humidity will make your room damp unless the A/C is kept cool enough. Nothing really dries out here, but that's just part of the area. The weather was great the whole time, and it doesn't really feel that humid outside. Nice breezes and shade keep you cool.

So I decided that it was time for me to write a review. This was my 17th all inclusive in the last 15 years. Check-in was quick and smooth. Upon getting to our room we got a call from the time share people, they did not identify that they were time share people, but asked us to come to the front desk for a welcome gift. I very strongly informed them that I was not going to waste my time or theirs with a time share presentation, they tried to convince us to attend anyway, I said no and they let it go. Upon getting back to our room they had also slid a invitation to come to the front desk and meet with them. Our room was located on the ground floor at the front of hotel, so our patio door opened to the beach. Wonderful room! Room was clean, bathroom had a shower only, free inroom safe with electronic 4 digit code that you choose. Room had a large flat panel TV, good selection of channels, not that I went to watch TV. This room could be an adjoining room with the room next door, and the noise level because of this was terrible. 3 nights we had neighbors next door that screamed constantly and it sounded like they were sitting next to you. The grounds, pool and beach at the resort were beautiful and kept very clean. The bars was stocked with brand name booze. There is tile around the pool and pool bar and snack bar areas and it is quite smooth and very slippery when wet, quite dangerous, and very common for people to fall. You were given 2 bottles of water for the week and were expected to refill these at the bar. This is green hotel. I am all about going green and recycling. However, you are in a foreign country where you can't drink the water, I don't even brush my teeth in the water. It is a know fact that you should not reuse water bottles that have been left in a hot place because of the danger that the plastic bottles can release cancer causing chemicals. Trust me, it is hot here. I don't mind refilling a bottle once, but for seven days? At the sit down restraurants, you only get 3 reservations for a 7 night stay. You make reservations at the guest services, you can book all 3 reservations the first day if you want, that is nice. The Mexican and Italian restraurants were both excellent. The mexican restraurant is the only air conditioned dining option at this hotel. The buffet option was located on the second floor and non air conditioned, and hot, hot, hot! I mean unbearably hot! The food selection was minimal and not good at all, if you even wanted to eat, as you were ringing wet. Food was left sitting out for 4 hours at a time in this high heat and sometimes was reused. The snack bar was average, good wood fire brick oven pizza. As I stated earlier I have been traveling to foreign countries for 15 years and am very careful about not drinking the water, brushing my teeth with bottled water, and not eatting or drinking anything off of the hotel. I have luckly never had to suffer Montezum's revenge until this trip. I spent 4 days suffering from montezum's revenge and my husband spent 2 1/2 days. It is hard to enjoy the vacation when you are glued to the bathroom. I couldn't eat or drink anything that would stay in, one day I only ate bread and water. I question some of the practices of this hotel in food and water safety. I would not return to this hotel because of these reasons, nobody spends there hard earned money to go on vacation and be sick the whole time.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle, UK", "Title": "\u201cAmazing!\u201d", "Author": "Lo_Newcastle_UK", "ReviewID": "UR119114885", "Content": "My husband and I have just arrived home from a fabulous holiday at this superb hotel. This was our first time in Mexico and first all inclusive experience and we weren't disappointed. Our room on the second floor in block 3000 was lovely. Very spacious and clean \u2013 two double beds, large dressing table, wardrobe, shower/bath and separate double sink area with an excellent wide floor to ceiling mirror. The room was cleaned thoroughly every day, and towels replaced. Would definitely recommend block 3000- It is further away from the 'main ' area of the resort but it was nice to have the little walk to appreciate the full immaculately kept grounds. The block was also nice and peaceful and did not suffer from any noise at night. From reading the other reviews it seems that this block is the newer of the 3 \u2013 we did not see any of the rooms in the other blocks so not sure how the blocks compare room wise. The food in the buffet restaurant exceeded our expectations. Lots of variety and good quality and there are lots of staff keeping the buffet area clean and clearing tables very quickly. Snack bar is also very good, the freshly made pizza especailly. Between this and the buffet restaurant there is food available if you want it, 24 hours a day. The al la carte restaurants were good. Only the Mexican and the Italian were open when we were there but we were offered a third at the Maya's sister hotel , the Azteca a few minutes walk away and we chose the Italian. The two Italian's were our favourites \u2013 the setting and the food was excellent. The service at the Maya's two al la carte's was faultless. We were not as impressed with the service at the Azteca though and from walking through the much smaller grounds there we certainly felt that the Maya is the better hotel. The beach was beautiful and the two pools were lovely. Only thing with the beach is that if you do want sun loungers that have some shade, as people were reserving them with their towels early, just to get some we had to resort to doing the same. We spent most of our time during the day on the beach and at the main pool making use of the pool bar and the gorgeous cocktails. The bars are very well stocked and you can have absolutely anything you want with no restriction on the brand of spirits or the quantity. Very good value for money.

I travelled with a friend. We scheduled last minute during high rain season a the Viva Wyndham Maya. We had beautiful weather and not a day of rain. We bundled hotel, flight and rental car for one week from Pittsburgh for under $800 per person.this was rated as 3 star by expedia. I have never stayed at below a 3.5 star so I went in with low expectations. We requested an ocean view room and got one which was a real plus considering that there are not many. The properties in the Riviera Maya are very spread out the advantage being more green space and the disadvantage being fewer ocean view/front rooms. Building codes forbid over 3 stories. This property has beautiful mature landscaping that has Mayan inspired art throughout-just lovely! The walkways are largely covered with Palapas and there are lots of palm trees. The beach was beautiful, lounge chairs plentiful and the Caribbean very calm here thus making water sports safe and accessible from the beach (where i've stayed in Cancun the waves are larger, resembling Atlantic Coast). We took advantage of sea kaying and went on a catamaran ride with one of the resort worker's sports crew. Highlights: beach, sports and entertainment staff, lobby bar with piano music at night and made to order coffee drinks rivaling Starbucks in the morning, adult pools, grounds and accessbility. Lowlights: the number smokers at the hotel (mostly Europmean and Candadian guests) and the buffet. The other reviews that I read are right on the mark with the critcism of the buffet. The food was fine but it was VERY HOT, nearly unbearable. Thankfully we were given more than three dinner reservations or I might have been more unhappy with this. Drove our rental car to Coba ruins (only a little over an hour!). they were incredible- very different than Chichen Itza but large-I wouln't take my children. I recommend taking around $100 in US $1s and $25 in $5s for dinner reservations. While these tips are not expected, the Mexican workers at these resorts have unsurpassed customer service skills and are extrremely hard-working. I was frankly shocked at the # of folks who did not tip at all.

My overall experience with Viva Wyndham Maya was wonderful! We got this hotel at an EXTREMELY low price. And for those of you waiting, wondering what your upcoming vacation is going to be like. Relax, you will have a blast! I also want to point out, I went with a LARGE group. No one was under 18.. but we had 15 people ages ranging from 18 - 50+ We also had alot of diversity, people who had never left the country, never been to mexico, never been on an airplane - to people who had traveled the world and stayed in nothing less then 5 star. And everyone enjoyed the trip, it was the perfect place to have this trip, everyone had a fun time. Rooms: The rooms were rooms, honestly how often are you in your room. Your in mexico. GTFO of your room and go enjoy the glorious beach that I guarantee you do not have at home! But yes, the rooms were nice. The bathrooms i believe are all new and renovated, I stayed in the 2100 block, and i had a balcony and the room was perfectly fine. No theres no alarm clock, but really your in mexico - who needs to keep track of time? your phone has a clock doesnt it? stop being so picky. Its not a 5 star, but the rooms were nice. comes with a safe. the cleaning staff is nice. please tip them! They make little animals out of the towels for you! we never once had a problem with theft, and no one in our group did. We left money out and in the safe. we also had a Macbook sitting out the whole time, and it was still there. The walls are thin yes, if your a light sleeper bring ear plugs. We had a little hiccup with one of the ladies on our trip - she said she paid for an upgraded room and she never got it so im not sure what really happened there, she didnt end up getting an upgraded room. All my requests were honors. (Kingbed - highfloors ) Staff: The staff was great! The entertainment staff tries so hard to get everyone involved. and i never had any problems with the reception. i lost my key three times... also the excursion staff and reservation staff was very nice too. They put on shows at night. they are kinda silly, and i mean obviously they arnt professional dancers, but they try and they are cute for kids. Food: The food is good, the buffet mixes it up a bit, but they have mexican food three times a week. Breakfast is good, they had make your own omelets, pastries, cereal, sausage, salad, a yogurt bar, pancakes, waffles. I always looked forward to breakfast. You an always find something to eat at this resort 24/7! its great. No room service, but i didnt expect it. The A la carte restaurants. are AMAZING! Seriously. Mediteranian is the best. And you can order whatever you want! If they try to say you cant, just be like yes i can, EVERYTHING is soooo good. I was not a fan of mexican, but my boyfriend loved it. Also TIP: Go to the italian restuarnt at the azteca. We had people who went to both that one and our resorts, conclusion was theirs was better. They say you only get three, but i guess cause we were such a large group, and had SO many rooms we got four. Portions are small. But if you have ever been to a 5 course restaurant in USA or Canada, they are small there too. Just order more, pretty simple. Beach: I was with people who have travelled all over the world and everyone said this was the best beach they had seen. No seaweed, clear clear clear water! You could even see fish swim past your feet. I dont know what everyone complains about the chairs... there was always room when we went. And we would hit the beach around 11 - 12:00. Bar: there are Five bars - one in the pool, one at the pool/snack bar and one in the lobby. There is ALSO one in the disco. Oh also, but the quiet pool ( near the 3000 block ) is a bar. But its so far we never went. ( but i guess only 2 technically ) They have a cute little drink menu of lots of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks, bar staff is so fun and funny and they deserve a world of tips! Excursions: We went on two excursions - Mayan treasures and Swim with Delphinus Mayan Treasure was amazing. it was 99$ and we went to Coba and climbed the temple. ( which closes for climbing in january. So if you get a chance climb it ) as well as we went around and visited many ruins, we had a great tour guide. We then had a short lunch which was great! buffet style. And then we went and got to swim in an underground cave, the water was cold but super clean and there were bats flying around and it was a very cool experience. Then we went to a mayan village where we met a shaman, and some families. its a good look at how lucky you have it. it was an all day trip 8 - 5 Very Good! Swim with Delphinus was VERY disappointing, you barely swam with the dolphins, the staff was not very friendly, and basically you just posed with the Dolphins, they took a picture on a basic camera and tried to sell it to you for 30$ a picture. It was not very interactive. I have swam with dolphins before, and the facility was actually in the ocean and the dolphins were with you the whole time and you got free time and you got to play with them. So this was disappointing. SPA: I was treated to a surprise massage, and I had mine in the spa not on the beach. It was great, they had a cold tub and a hot tub for you to relax in before the massage, and the massage it self was very good compared to ones i have had back at home! Very nice staff very clean and relaxing. My friend got one on the beach and she said she enjoyed it aswell. Keep in mind you get more value if you go inside because you get the hot tubs, you dont need to wear a bathing suit and it is quiet with music.

My wife and I really enjoyed our stay and overall it was a good trip. Room- we had the superior room, it was pretty good, it was clean but it had a very \"damp\" feeling/ smell to the room. That was the only downside, otherwise the room was excellent. Beach- The beach is amazing!! we visted beaches in Cancun and loved the beach at the resort a whole lot better. Bar- The bar options are great and they have a wide selection, only two bars on the resort but most of the time they move pretty quickly. Shows- The shows are amazing and the staff that takes part is very lively and nice. I recommend watching these shows they are really good Staff- the staff is very very friendly, not one of the staff members walked past us without saying \"ola\"...they were helpful and we liked them very much Food- the buffet is huge but the food is pretty much the same everyday. I thought the food quality could of been better, as some basic things had no taste to them. However, there are 3 restaurants that are on the resort and can be booked only for dinner. They were Mexican, Italian, and Meditteranian. The restaurants were AMAZING!!!! Please book to eat at these restaurants, you can only book 3 reservations so you can only eat there once, but it was great. Excursions- They help you book excursions at the hotel, and they are a must!!! I can get into an essay of how great they were, please try to do some excursions in Mexico because its amazing. Overall my trip was amazing and I loved it. This resort is located near all the other resorts in Playa Car...its 5 minutes away from Playa Del Carmen and going to the town is a must as they have some decent shops/food/bars...the people are very pushy for you to come into thier shops and may hastle you a bit, and what you have to do is just ignore them. Taxi's are a little expensive so try not to use them alot unless you have to. You can use the bus service from Playa Del Carmen if you want to go to Cancun as its a cheap option.

Loved it. Would give it a 9/10. We have been to 10+ all inclusives in various parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. I was traveling with my husband (30s), my in laws (60s) and my son (2). Firstly, we picked this resort because of location to Playa Del Carmen. It did not disappoint. It was hot, so we did not walk each time, but for a $7 cab ride to the ferry or 5th Avenue it was great. It is in the gated community of Playacar with resorts and private homes. Nice to walk or bike ride. I will try to break it down with as much detail as I can: Grounds: meticulous, lots of wildlife, clean. Everything is simple and classy. Loved the coffee bar near the lobby and the courtyard (awesome to sit out at night under the trees). Loved the palapas and the whole atmosphere. Loved the seating areas by the pool and beach. Beach: Awesome. Beautiful colour of water, nice beach. Lots of loungers- only a problem to find one if you want shade. There is a seperate VIP area- we were not offered to upgrade, but didn't bother us. Volleyball and lifeguard. Showers. Pool: Nice. Large enough with two areas to lounge on flat tile. Swim up bar with a few stools. Small kids pool (1ft) and a deeper smaller pool attached to main pool. Large jacuzzi type pool. We spent alot of time in the pool. Very clean. Snack Bar: Great. Soup, pasta, chicken, fresh fruit, dessert, pizza *(many types), hamburgers, hotdogs and fries. Open 10am-6pm and 10pm-6am. Ate most lunches here as great seating areas and close to everything. Buffet: Loved it. Please take people's opinions with a grain of salt. We ate several times and it was great. My son loved everything. Typical buffet fare with theme nights. We always thought it was great. The pastries and desserts were yummy. Everything from salad, to fresh fruit, to soups, to meat, to pasta station and mexican area. Don't understand how people could complain. A la Cartes: We genuinely loved all of them. Quality food. Classy atmosphere and great service. The food was so delicious! We went to all three- I loved the Mexican the best, but the other two were on the same level of quality. Yum! Staff: staff was amazing from the gardeners, to front desk, to servers. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Room: We were in the 1200 block. We would have preferred on the ground floor but opted to take the rooms that were available as we arrived early in the day. The rooms were simple and clean. Loved the balcony. Bathroom is amazing! Large with lots of counter space, shampoo and shower gel dispenser in a huge shower with glass door. Maid service was excellent. Mini fridge in room, safe in closet. Drawers for clothing. I would have liked more water, but a trip to Walmart fixed that. Shows: Honestly, some of the most professional shows I've seen at a resort. Sets, costumes, choreography! I usually watch one show and then don't bother for the rest of the week. They had a kids mini disco at 9 which my son loved and we stayed EVERY night for the show. Really great and entertaining. We also went to the disco one night which was fun! WI-fi- There is an internet cafe that you pay for, but you can get a free wifi signal by the pool and near the lobby. It was strong enough for us to use Skype. Can't get the signal in your room, which wasn't a big deal. Bars: My husband loved the top shelf liquor. I loved the bar menu, the slushy drinks and the cappucino! Bartenders always quick to serve you. Overall, a great experience. Didn't want to come home! Can't think of anything to complain about!

The buffet food is OK - we have traveled quite a bit and of course some buffets are better than others, but this is the first time we really did not want to eat at the buffet the last few days we were there. The pasta and pizza were the saving grace of the buffet as they were usually good. If you catch the fries when they are fresh, also good but otherwise cold and stale because they sit out until they need to be replenished. It was pretty much the same food all of the time, sometimes there were different variations of the same food. The pool snack bar food was pretty good, it also usually had the pizza and pasta - the burgers were good there as well, but I did not try the hot dogs. What the VWM could use is an area (or sports bar) with maybe some pool tables, other activity tables (there is 1 ping pong table in an open area that I saw) or darts and music, something that would give you something to do in the evenings. We found that after dinner we pretty much just waited around for the show (9:30) and then after the show your only option is sitting around the common areas or going to the disco at 11:00. The disco is probably excellent if you are 23, but we have also been to other discos in other resorts that had some variety in the music they played (still playing some club music but throwing in other music as well that everybody might enjoy (rock, pop, etc.) - I guess they have to compete with the clubs in Playa in trying to keep the younger crowd on the resort. We found the VWM to be a bit of a drag in the evenings. The \u201csuperior\u201d rooms seem to all offer the same view, mostly of the gardens or walkways and alot of the balconies appeared to be quite small. We found that as we were checking in there was another line up of people waiting to see if they could change rooms, mostly it seems to have a better view (I believe these people had previously checked in and were told to come back later or even the next day to see what else would be available to them). We made a decision then that we would upgrade rather than have to wait in line again, as we knew the area that we were given our room in had a terrible view and was nowhere near the ocean or the pool. We opted for the VIP upgrade so our view was excellent, right on the beach in front of the volleyball area. It had a private Jacuzzi on the balcony (we had 2 balconies), and this package also included a late check out, VIP area on the beach (neither here nor there for us, but it was included) and we could eat at the Azteca any time we wanted (again, didn\u2019t really matter we just wanted a half decent room view). I spoke to somebody there who had also purchased an upgrade at a lesser price than what we paid but I don\u2019t recall being told about that one at the front desk, so there may be 2 levels of upgrades. Even with the extra money paid for this amazing view, we had an adjoining room (which we weren\u2019t aware of until we got to the room) which had REALLY thin walls - we were lucky that it was not too bad and the room was not always occupied but it could have really put a damper on the holiday if is was with somebody who was not necessarily keeping the same hours as us). All in all for us, the upgrade was an excellent decision!!! The liquor was always good, lots of drink options and the posted drink menu was great to have. If you wanted the top shelf liquor all you had to do was ask for it, no problem. The only thing that would have been nice would be an option of non-draft beer, but again I know that probably a higher star resort would offer this. We just bought a few beers in Playa for $1.00 each and brought them back to keep in our room. We had a fridge, but I know that others did not (I\u2018m not sure if this is based on paying for upgrades or not).

I don't understand the negative reviews... Yes, I got a great deal but the way people we writing about the place I thought it was going to be no better than a Cuba vacation. I love Cuba, but go there for a different kind of trip. Rooms - Spotless, spacious and comfortable. The washroom is modern enough and the bed is not as good as the one I have home but I paid as much for it as my whole trip... I slept like a baby (was tired from running around all day). Food - There is something to eat at every meal, the buffet has a wide variety of food and no one will be hungry. Yes! the buffet can get pretty stuffy, my secret was to get a table by one of the windows facing the rest of the resort and let the breeze cool me down a little. Dress down while you eat there and you will be fine. Not crazy about the a la carte, the Mexican place was ok (more variety) - didn't try any of the Aztec a la cartes. None of us got sick while we were there, we ate and drank in moderation and stuck generally to food that we are used to eating. Great Beach and pool - Love the waves and at this time of the year we could walk in to the water (sea and pool water) as if we were getting in to our own temperature controlled bathtub. For me, that was amazing. Yes! Beach chairs with shade disappear early but I was there for the sun and didn't want to bother getting there before 10am, I was vacationing. The grounds are incredibly clean, the staff is friendly and the front desk is simply accommodating. Every request I had was dealt with and within a reasonable time frame (they set the expectations and met them every time). My requests were reasonable. And hear this, they have 2 Wifi hot spots for free!!! One is by the lobby and the other by the entertainment complex (by the pool). It meets it's 4 star rating easily, it has a lot of activities for the guests (archery, gym) were two that I tried. The kids club seems very good, 2-3 adults for 5-8 kids and the kids are sometimes part of the entertainment shows. The night shows are ok, no one is paying Broadway prices to watch and they can be entertaining. You want better food? Pay an extra $200-300 per person and go to a 5 star... If you are going to listen to the time share people, try to get a greatly discounted or free tour and don't buy whatever they propose (if you do, that is ok too, your choice) but it takes away from your vacation time. In a place where tours are expensive, if they heavily discount one of them for the 3 hours, it's worth it. $7 USD each way to Fifth Avenue by cab, you can take our a bike for up to 3 hrs at a time and take 10 min to reach the street safely or walk for about 25 min to get there. Playacar is an enclosed space that ends a block from fifth avenue. No AC at the gym, very stuffy and hot. Got a sports massage for $71 USD at the resort, great massage by Antonia, half my size but made my tense muscles disapear.

Food was average (buffet that does not particularly present Mexican cuisine). Breakfast was kind of repetitive - again, it was a regular buffet. Once, we tried the Miramare. If you are looking for romantic restaurant, I will recommend you to go early so that you could enjoy a nice sunset. - Due to the reasonable size of the pools, we did not find them too crowded.

The Maya has people from all around the world and everyone is great.

These two should not be in customer facing positions as they clearly are unable to smile or be polite and give the guest a very poor impression. The maids work very hard and the rooms whilst basic are clean, but noisy the Animation Team are good and the evening shows are enjoyable.

We had a wonderful time. Check in was smooth, so was check out for that matter. We even had a problem resolved for us by the hotel staff since our airline representative forgot to update a change of flight time and we weren't sure at what time our shuttle would pick us up.... hotel staff called up airport, and our travel desk to confirm times of pick up and flight... very helpful when you don't speak the language!! Kids had a very good time. Our 10 year old daughter loved the trapeze and reserved a spot for every day we were at resort. The beach was beautiful. Water gorgeous. The only negative point would be the 'guards' that would harass us in the mornings for leaving our beach chairs. I understand when people leave their towels early in the morning on chairs and only come back at mid-day, having 'reserved' chairs in choice spots... but my husband, or I, would get to beach early in morning, and STAY there till the rest of family arrived, of course, we would place towels on 4 chairs so that we all could sit together... but even if you stayed there, they would harass you to remove towels on 'unoccupied' chairs... and watch out if you go into the water... you weren't certain that your stuff wouldn't be removed by hotel staff. That part was very unpleasant. By mid morning though, they left you alone. Also, the beach reserved for this resort was very narrow, so all beach chairs were very close to one another... being clausterphobic, this was very uncomfortable the first day since we were 'caught' in the middle, but we adjusted and chose chairs on edge for the rest of the stay and it was ok. Food was ok. The \u00e0 la carte restaurants were very good, especially the Mediterranean. As for only 3 reservations per week at these restaurants... well, all resorts that we've stayed at before had the same restriction of 3 reservations per week... so it was no big surprise for us. Yes it was hot in the buffet restaurant, but we always managed to find a table beside a window and had a nice breeze. The shows were ok. We've seen better shows at other resorts, but I have to say that the costumes and decors were superior by far than at other resorts. As for the quality of the shows... well if you're into lipsyncing, then you'll be happy as a clam!! Personally, I prefer real singing, even if it's not top quality compared to lipsyncing. Rooms were great. We had a room on the ground floor close to the beach, pool, theater. Being that our son is 13 and daughter is 10, they prefer to have separate beds, so hotel staff wheeled in an extra bed for us, at no cost. Very cooperative. We didn't have any theft problem. We locked up all valuables in safe in the room. Once, my husband forgot his watch, which is quite valuable, on dresser all day, and it still was there when we got back at night. On beach, apart form staff problem mentionned earlier, nobody touched any of our things. We left books, cameras and even money in beach bags and nothing was ever touched. All in all, this resort is pretty much what we expected for the price. If you want 5 star service/food/amenities, go to a 5 star resort! I always find it amusing that people complain that the food is different from home, service is different from home and that there aren't enough people speaking English... if you want all those things, then just stay home! When you travel to a foreign country... expect foreign food, customs and people, it comes with the territory!!

The website is very misleading with all of the so called amenities and activities they offer. Absolutely no where on teh website does it specify that you are limited to the nights you can make reservations at the Al A Carte Restaurants onsite. We stayed for 7 nights so we were only allowed to make reservations for 3 nights. With this being said, our only option for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and it is OPEN AIR dining another detail the website leaves off. It was like a herd of cattle in this place so if you were lucky enough to get food and not be pushed out of the way or things taken right out from in front of you, you are drenched in sweat and to uncomfortable to eat at this point. They will not let you take the food out of the dining area either. We were told there was room service 24/7 absolutely NO ROOM SERVICE. We like to meet new people and make new friends while on vacation. If you are American and do not speak several other languages fluently this is impossible. Some staff members were friendly but for the most part the majority of them didn't act to happy to be there either. They tell you on the website you can use the sister resorts amenities, absolutely not, the only thing you can do is make one of your reservations for a restaurant on their property. They wouldn't even give us drinks at the lobby bar while waiting for our table. The last and most upsetting issue of our stay. We were all at the beach and decided to go to 5th Ave. So we all headed to our rooms we had adjoining rooms with our children. We had two cloth type bags one with a camera and ipod and one with money in it. Housekeeping was in the children's room when we came in. My son set both bags on the sink as he was saying yeah I got money (being funny because it was ours). He then went into the bathroom stall and housekeeping entered the area of the sink. When he walked out of the stall, the bag with the money was gone. We were frantically looking for it as it had well over $200 US Dollars in it, the housekeeper looked extremely nervous when I entered the room looking for it. Some how the front desk heard something from someone and called our room. When I explained what we were looking for, they asked to speak to housekeeping. Housekeeping staff and supervisor both refused to get on the phone and left our room and was talking out in the hall and didn't finish our rooms. I then went to the front desk and asked guest services to send someone to our room that could translate for us and the housekeeper as all we wanted to do was look in the towels she had picked up out of the bathroom to make sure it hadn't got mixed up in those towels. They said they would have to inquire as to whether housekeeping found anything and get back to us in at least 1/2 hour. By the time I made it back to the room, housekeeping had already dumped towels in the laundry shoot , how convenient. So needless to say, guest services were not interested in helping us resolve this issue. Rooms were nice, walls are paper thin and doors don't latch without being slammed so if you are not a dead weight sleepers don't plan on getting much rest.

The sports and entertainment staff work so hard at making sure guests have a fun time at the hotel. They are never pushy, but always friendly. There are catamarans, boogie boards and kayaks all for your use, and Odi, Ivan, Donald, Cassandra and Miguel were all there to help us, or take us on rides. They are the best! The kids waited until our last day to try out the trapeze (thank you Donald) they wish they had done it sooner! They have volleyball and dance lessons every day, and many other fun games etc...Cindy, Milton, Israel, Eric, Nicholas, Miriam, and Daniel were all amazing! The shows at night are great! I will say it again that the staff works so hard! After the show everyone heads over to the disco where D.J Dario plays some great music until 2am. If you have children between the ages of 4 and 12, they have a great kids club where you can take your kids for the day.

The hotel staff: rude!! When we checked in the lady behind the counter was not friendly at all. We are friendly people and were excited to be there and she totally changed our mood! The bartenders were nice(sometimes)- it depended on their day. Also, hard to communicate with. The young workers(on the other hand) that did the shows and entertained throughout the day were very nice and fun! They could keep anyone entertained and actually got my husband to salsa(very rare occurance) The food: At all the other resorts we have stayed at, there will be a couple restaurants (mexican, italian, seafood, etc) and the visitors have access to all restaurants. Some may require reservations and some dont-you come and go as you please. NOT AT VIVA! We were excited to try all the restaurants we read about before booking our vacation with them. Food is something you want to enjoy while on vacation. We stayed 4 nights so we got to choose ONE place to have a nice dinner at. You get a certain number of reservations depending on your stay. So its safe to say we didnt get to enjoy but one nice dinner. And that dinner was not good at all. We HAD to choose the italian restaurant bc that was the only one they had at the time of our stay. It was at Viva Azteca(the sister resort). I chose the salmon-not good and VERY small portion. My husband chose the filet mignon, that was definitly not filet mignon. It was three small burnt peices of thin meat that he asked for medium rare. On another note: the buffet was great! Its a good thing because that is all we had to eat for the other three nights if we wanted to eat anything. Im not sure if it was the food or water but I had \"stomach issues\" starting the day before we left(monday) till today (still!) The rooms: not that great! We asked for a king bed and never got it. They dont have alarm clocks or any clocks at that matter. A little too dirty for my taste. Also old and boring. Also, dont try to eat or drink at the other resort that they SAY they share. We went over to try there buffet(for something different) because it was our understanding that we could. Well you cant, they said we could eat that one time but then we had to go. So we tried the bar area outside and they said they would serve us one drink but that was it! Also, We never met anyone else that spoke english, so never made any friends.

Nothing wrong with that as long as you are prepared for the pretty bland cuisine and insipid drinks. The walls between the rooms really are paper thin, so if you are a light sleeper, take some earplugs. You only get a bottle of water (one per room) when you arrive. After that you can get free refills but need to get them from the bar - something of an inconvenience. No fridge in the room, so nowhere to keep anythin cool, should you wish to do so. And a safe to small for a standard size laptop. All of which is, as I say, pretty run of the mill for such a resort. What was most disappointing was to have money stolen from inside our safe and also from the children's room, albeit that theirs was left in a purse in a bag in the room for a couple of hours. The resort sadly did little to address either theft and according to our rep from Hayes and Jarvis, our safe theft was \"the first she had ever seen\". This seems highly unlikely given the lack of surprise from guest services or the police when we reported it to them. It seems our childrens room was entered via the patio door being forced open, so I recommend a room not on the ground floor. This is the second time it has happened to us in a resort in this area, with exactly the same modus operandi being used. We haven't, so far, experienced it anywhere else in the world. The diving is excellent, but a little lax. Great if you are experienced divers but we saw several inexperienced divers way below the safe limit of 30 metres. The dive team are all very friendly but don't expect them to keep you at the right depth. If you're a keen diver, a visit to Cozumel is a must with some of the best reef I have seen anywhere. Overall the staff were friendly, though guest services was a misnomer if you wanted anything out of the ordinary. Play del Carmen itself has become like a mini Cancun, which is not a good thing in my opinion. Too built up now and increasingly full of big clubs and bars - a pity for those of us who have been visiting for the last ten years.

We are 23 and 24 years old. This was my 7th time in the Caribbean (Mexico, Cuba and Dominican) and first time in Mexico. Let me start off by saying I was very sceptical prior to arriving because the reviews were not so good, but I have no idea what those people were complaining about or expecting. Sure if you expect to get 5-star amenities at the price we paid/for a 3.5 star resoirt, you COULD be disappointed. But all in all, there are very few things to complain about. BEACH- beautiful white sand beach. I've heard from a travel agent friend that Viva has one of the best beaches in the Riviera Maya/Cancun area. White sand beach, blue waters. The ocean is even a bit wavy, which I really liked because it definitely makes for a good time. The only complaint here (which is completely out of the resort's hands) is that when there was a thunderstorm during the night, there was a lot of seaweed and murky waters for the next day or two. But I do commend the staff for their immense effort, because the one day that was really bad in terms of seaweed, they actually spent the WHOLE day digging up holes and burying the seaweed. POOL- There are 2 pools. Both a bit on the smaller side. Swim-up pool bar for one of them, and the other one has a bar right beside it. Really liked that the \"fun\" pool was right beside the beach so you never had t fully commit to staying at the beach or the pool. There is also a relaxing pool which is at the other side of the resort, no music at this pool and not supposed to bring kids there even though there were sometimes (didn't bother us). RESORT-GROUNDS- This is not a big resort, everything is within a short distance walk. The grounds are always being upkept. I swear I always saw lawns my sprinkled, staff cleaning away water accumulation on walkways, etc. The grounds are simple, yet very nice. Nice courtyard area as well, though we didn't spend much time there since it was a bit older of a crowd. STAFF- The staff here really seem to be happy. You can always count on an Hola as you walk by and they are very accomodating to any questions/requests. More specifically, the animation staff are really engaging and genuinely happy and smiling. They would come ask you on the beach if you wanted to participate in activities, but would not pester you on most days (there was one or two times where I found them a bit annoying). I was actualy surprised at the amount of languages they spoke: English, French, Spanish, Italian and possibly German as well. The daytime animation staff were the people in the night time shows too (more on that later.) ROOMS- I had emailed a week before with 3 requests : ocean view, king bed and 2nd or 3rd floor. We arrived on the 21st late at night and found they have us a room with oceanview, 2nd floor, but 2 double beds. We found this very weird and preferred to sleep together, we went to the lobby and there was nothing they could do that night due to the availability. A large amount of people were leaving the next morning so they told us to go back then to change the room. We were moved to the new building which is near the relaxing ppol (farther from beach and pool). There was definitely a trade off because we no longer had ocean view and had to settle for 1st floor, but the room was so much nicer! I felt like we were upgraded to a presidential suite! So the moral of the story is if you want a view and to be more central, ask for a room in the 1000s or 2000s. But if you want a much nicer room (with a fridge and alarm clock because they other rooms don't seem to have) and a quieter area, then ask for a room in the new building (3000s). SHOWS- All 6 previous resorts I have been to, the shows were mediocre at beat, and quite frankly, very cheese. I would only go a few times to kill time. But at Viva, I actually looked forward to the shows! The costumes were so intricate, and the choreography was awesome! I went to all shows but one! Some of the themes were pirates, Madonna, Moulin Rouge, Disney, etc. FOOD/DRINKS- Let me start off with the drinks. There is a menu at every bar so you can actually make an educated decision. There was a large variety of cocktails, coffees, non-alcoholic drinks and martinis. I really liked the fact that I actually knew what they could make and I tried every drink! You can ask them to be made with the brands like Smirnoff, Havana Club, etc., but I didn't bother. Buffet: There was several themes during my week stay, but there was always a pasta station for lunch/dinner There was an omelet station for breakfast. One night was Japanese and it says a lot when a MExican resort does not mess up sushi! There was a lot of variety and you could always find several things to eat. I will admit that somethings did not look appetizing and that I was kind of tired of the buffet food towards the end because it got repetitive but that's what the restaurants are for! Restaurants: You get to choose 3 for a week stay. We went to Mexican, Mediterranean and Italian of the Viva Wyndham Azteca (you have access to those too.) There were all very good, I was a bit sick on the day we went to Mexican so I did not each much, but what I had was very good. There is a appetizer, soup, specialty and main course section on the menu, you got to choose one from 3 of those sections + a dessert. Always more than enough food! All in all, the food is probably about 4* quality. SUNWING- The flight went by fine, they offer you a lot on the flight. The only thing is that there is not much leg room. We booked one excursion through Sunwing which I will talk about later. We also booked a night at CocoBongos (more to come). My only complaint is that one day when I inquired about CocoBongos, the rep told us it come with the entry and one ride there. We came back another day to book, we confirmed the details and the other rep that was there said they were accurate. We realized we forgot our wallet so we told her we were going to come back later in afternoon. When we booked, she then informed us that we no longer got a lift there because we needed to reserve that before 3pm. It would have been nice if she informed us of that earlier. COBA EXCURSIONS- Ill keep this brief. It was a little expensive (110$) for what it was (visit a Mayan village that had nothing really going on, climb Coba lunch and swimming in a cenote). However, we are in Mexico and we really wanted to see the Mayan ruins which was amazing. The cenote was beautiful too. Just don't understand why so expensive. COCOBONGOS- you cannot come to Mexico without coming here! Seems expensive (55$), but totally worth it. It is like a mix of a club, Broadway show, circus. There were small acts throughout the night, with dancing in between. Fun for all ages, really! AND it really is open bar. You do not leave your spot at all, the bus boys come and take your order every 10 minutes or sometimes they even just bring you your drink. At one point, I had 3 drinks in front of me! It is really a fun time, you have to go! Sorry if this is super long, I just wanted to give this resort what it deserved- a good rating!

The Buffet area was always crowded by the food and so hot! It seemed as though they kept it that way to you ate less. Also the number of nights you stay determines the number of reservations you can have the non buffet restaurants. This was never explained to us before we went to make reservations. We complained and we got 5 reservations. We heard from a lot of other guests that they could only get 1 or 2 reservations because of availability. I would say that he food at the reservations restaurants was really good, much better than the buffet. Our room and the hallway regularly smelled like a sewer. If we kept the bathroom door closed the smell tended to stay in the bathroom. We did not like the onsite dive shop. They were really outgoing when they were getting you to buy a dive, but the dive master seems annoyed that he had to help any of the divers with anything. He had 4 or 5 divers doing a discovery dive and seemed annoyed that some of the rest of wanted help with a few things. And then a lady put her stuff on wrong and he didn't check it so she ended up having some issues when we jumped into the water. And he chewed her out for doing it wrong. Also you had to get most of your out to the boat through the surf and then they wanted you carry you tank back to the beach. Several of the women could not get up the steep beach withe their gear and they seemed annoyed to have to help. We have been diving in many other places around the world and the people and service were much better.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Moody, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWe had a great time, but probably won't go back\u201d", "Author": "FitMom68", "ReviewID": "UR115776732", "Content": "We just returned from a weeks vacation at this hotel. First off, the weather was fantastic the whole time except for one night of thunder, lightening and harsh rain. However, it only lasted about 10 minutes and it cooled things off. Really cool to watch. Pros: Air and Bus line: Plane was a bit tight for seat but I am short so it did not effect me. My husband was squished though. Bus very large and comfy with good air conditioning. We booked through Sun Wing Vacations and I will indefinably book with them again. All the employees including airline were friendly and outgoing. Hotel: We emailed hotel a week ahead to request Ocean Front and Fridge in the 2200 block which is close to both pool and ocean. We stayed in 2205 and it was perfect. as we had ocean view and pool view. Check in was fast and efficient. We were even able to book all 3 restaurants the same day. Just be polite, patient and smile and things will run smoother. Our room was bright, extremely clean and spacious. Beds are a little hard but still comfy. We tipped the maid every day and they made animals out of the towels. Our fridge was stocked with water and pop and we also had lots of coffee and tea. No stir sticks though, but no big deal. There was a nice big wide screen tv on the wall with a good variety of channels to choose from when we would settle in for the night. The safe was a great as well. Just punch in your own code and it locks. Ironing board and iron as well as lots of drawers. Our bathroom had a huge shower and it did leak, but just needed a little more cocking around the glass bottom. Very clean! All the plumbing worked well and no musty smell whatsoever. The Hotel it self is a perfect size. Very easy to get around and a beautiful sitting area with trees in the middle. Each night they served champagne and orange juice with some nice lounge music playing while you sat and relaxed. They have a nice size gym, but it is not air conditioned. However, its bearable and there are fans. The Spa and Kids Club is right next door. There are just so many free activities to list. The Animation team worked very hard to keep things rolling and fun all day and night long. They always have a smile on their faces and remember your name after one day. I give them an A+ The Waiters/Waitress and Bar staff were very friendly and fast. So fast that if you leave your table for just a second even if your dinner is not done they will take it. That to me was a bit much, but I understand they need to keep dishes clean for the ongoing vacationers. At any rate, always smiling and friendly! The Beach was out of this world! Big and Beautiful and very Blue. Lots of huts pool side and on the beach. Just be down to get a spot no later then 7:30 a.m. or you are out of luck. They serve at 11 a.m. Thin crust Pizza, Hot Dogs, Hamburgers and other hot foods by the pool.Note: There is no Butler service at the beach or pool. You will always have to fetch your own drinks and stand in line ups. Exception is in the restaurants. Location: Playacar is a gated community only 4minute drive by Taxi from 5th Ave. 70 to 100 pesos pending where you get let out. Across from the hotel is a Starbucks and some little shops. Need some Air condition then Starbucks has a nice sit down area upstairs. Food: There is always a great variety of foods to eat and everything tasted great to me. I think some of the reviews on the food people write are a bit harsh. This is not a 5 star resort so don't expect 5 star foods. However, there is still plenty of foods to chose from. Alcohol: Tip or or do not Tip they do not cheap out. If you want top shelf, just ask. They will be glad to make it for you. I like to tip as I feel they work their butts off and deserve it. There are many restaurants in USA and Canada that add the tip to your check so why wouldn't you tip here? Don't get me wrong, if you don't they will still treat you the same. RESPECT is the answer to getting good service. Carlos at the pool bar was awesome! Cons: Air conditioning: Main restaurant does not have air conditioning and it was so hot in there you would be drenched in sweat before you sat down to eat. Only the optional restaurants have air condition and you need to make reservations when you arrive to get in. Security is tight which is good, but they are so very rude to all the vacationers. This is something I witnessed every day. They need to learn to smile and say hi. One night my brother wanted me to come out to meet him on 5th Ave and I did not feel safe to go alone. +Just a personal issue+ so my brother took a taxi to hotel to come and get me and they were not going to let him come into property. They told me I had to walk down to road to meet him. I asked for manager and they called him and he let my brother enter. You almost feel as they don't trust anyone and give you a very uncomfortable feeling when you pass by them. Many travelers I met would concur. Pool and Beach: People go down and reserve spots then go back to bed. Security will take their towels and put them back and when another person comes to take spot, the original people come down and then the fights start. It is just crazy! Also, too many smokers everywhere. There should be a designated spot. My 3 year old son was playing on beach among the many cigarette butts. Staff do their best to keep clean, but there seems to be too many smokers to keep up. Pool deck is marble tile and very slippery. I saw many people wipe out including myself . The pool itself is very murky looking. Probably from all the people who sit at swim up bar and never get out to pee or perhaps all the suntan lotion. The tile in the pool felt slimy by noon. In a nutshell this place is great except for the few little cons I posted. However, I have been to Playa Del Carmen a half dozen times now and I know my wants when traveling there again. I need to have a beautiful beach I don't have to fight to sit at, clean pool with butler service to pool and beach because I am on vacation and feeling lazy:) I have stayed at other resorts that offer all of this so I will plan to go back to one of them on my next travels in March 2012. Feel free to contact with any questions. Cheers! All in all its a great place if you are trying to travel cheap with family. You gt your bang for your buck! If they turned my Cons to Pros I would vacation there always!", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cCrowded Everywhere\u201d", "Author": "AndreaMexAtl", "ReviewID": "UR115737434", "Content": "I honestly had a great time at this hotel, but i'm a huge people person if you like personal space and quiet beaches this is not the place for you.

We read up about it before hand on Trip Advisor and I felt some negative things that were said were unfair. I wanted to give an honest and helpful review. When we landed it was pouring rain and didnt stop until that night but thats not the hotels fault! Transport arranged by travel company and was only an hour from airport. First appearances are important and the hotel didnt diappoint. We were very happy with the hotel and its surroundings. Courtyard was lovely (even in the rain!), reception staff was very helpful and the room was basic but clean and big enough. Our bath tub was a little worn but at the same time very clean so we didnt see it as a problem. Our room was in the 2000 block and although we didnt have much of a view, (we hadnt asked) it was central between the lobby/restaurant and the pool/stage/beach so it was perfect. Theres a tv in your room with a good selection of stations, english and spanish, and our room was cleaned every day with a fresh supply of towels if needed. We didnt tip until the end of our holiday and this didnt effect the service we received. The food, we thought, was very good. They had different themes most nights and although coming towards the holiday it did get a little repetitive, it was of good quality and there was ALWAYS something you would eat. Pasta station was very good as you could create your own sauces, pizzas were yummy and, of course, salsa very good. We did the Mexican and the Italian a la cart and had no problem getting a booking. We booked for half eight both nights and it was perfect. I suspect some people must be trying to make a booking the morning of the meal so try book your meal for a few days before you want to go as not to be disappointed. We also ate down the town one night and it a nice break from the buffet. But, on the whole, we enjoyed it. My partner did have a upset tummy one day in the centre of the trip but this was the day after we had taken an excursion and had eaten at a restaraunt near Chitzen Itza so we think it was from this and not the restaurant. My tummy can be quite sensitive and I was fine throughout the trip and he was fine after that day. Snack bar at pool bar was fine if you just wanted a quick snack or quick lunch. Food cooked and constantly refreshed. Some people had complained that they had only received one bottle of water in their room but you are supposed to refill this bottle and not dispose of it. There is purified water at every bar. And I even used the ice which I wouldnt normally do and it was absolutly fine. We did find that the drinks dispenser was tempermental when you put your money in but we just got two glasses of water to bring up to the room every evening and that was grand. Note theres no fridge in the rooms but again, we didnt find this a problem and we didnt spend alot of time in it! Tip: Dont leave food lying around you room. We left some crisps on our bedside table and found some ants on it. We got rid of them ourselves and learned our lesson. We had no more problems with them Entertainment in the hotel is good and there if you want it. Aqua Aerobics was alot of fun! There is music at the main pool for the aerobics and dance lessons so if you prefer some peace and quiet, the relax pool also available for adults only. We never really had a problem getting an umberella beside the pool, got one most days and we didnt get down to pool area until nearly ten most mornings so theres plenty to go around. Beach is lovely and clean. Sand is soft, white and doesn't get too hot. Broken shells get washed up so its a little uncomfortable when you start to go in but once your in its sandy and quite shallow for a good bit. Also the day time entertainment stretches to the beach, bowls, volleyball and football are a few available, so you wont miss out. Night time entertainment was good for the most part. Not always our cup of tea but the staff work very hard and you can see this in the shows. All staff from reception (who gave us a new towel card for free when we lost ours!), to entertainment, to resaurant and bar staff were all friendly and helpful. We found alcohol fine. Beer was local beer and very nice and they do lovely alcoholic and nonalcoholic cocktails. Tip: If you want, for example, rum and coke, ask for Havana Club and coke. If you just ask for rum they will give you the cheap stuff but they generally have the brand name stuff too but you need to ask. We did two excursions. Chitzen Itza was very interesting. It was 3 hrs away but we also got to see a colonial town and a beautiful natural lagoon. Guide very nice. We went to XPLOR also which we did on our own. Taxi ride was only ten minutes and entry was 99 dollars so we saved money. Tip: Book excursion with the guy on the beach, its much cheaper and we didnt have to listen to the guide in four of five different langauges! Town is about a 30 min walk or 70 pesos in a taxi and well worth a visit, Enjoy haggling at the stalls!! All in all we had a great and relaxing time. We didnt let the small stuff ruin our trip and would recommend this hotel.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape May, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGood Value but Don't attend any Time-Share Presentation!\u201d", "Author": "Pks88", "ReviewID": "UR115497180", "Content": "For the price, this hotel was perfect.

It is not intended to depress anyone, it is just an honest account of what myself and my partner experienced. Myself and my partner booked this hotel via Hayes and Jarvis, who sold the resort as a 4 star hotel. It was reasonably expensive when it was booked and we arrived on June 26th this year and stayed for 10 nights. Firstly when we arrived in Mexico the weather was very disappointing. It was torrential rain and very windy. This continued for the first 2 days of the holiday, which we did not expect or enjoy. The private taxi transfer to the hotel was not a pleasant experience and while this was no fault of the hotels, it basically set the tone of what was to become a very disappointing experience. The check-in was fine.......we handed over the paperwork which was required and were given a key to our room and the usual ugly plastic band which relates to the all-inclusive package. The bellboy then took our luggage to the room, which we discovered was on the ground floor, despite the specific request of a balcony which was also in the paperwork provided. In addition to this the room had a pungent damp smell. I returned to reception and they instead offered us an alternative room on the opposite side of the hotel on the 1st floor which we accepted. This room also had a strong pungent stench of dampness which was very unpleasant. In addition, the noise from the hotel next door was very loud and could be heard despite the patio doors being closed. At this point we were too tired to either address the issue and possibly have to move rooms yet again. The room was very basic but was clean enough. Bed sheets also didn't fit the beds. The lock on the patio door was very insecure and could easily be overcome. Food - The main buffet restaurant in the hotel had no air-conditioning but the windows were open to allow air and of course any birds, flies and insects who may also be hungry to sample the food in the restaurant. This I found particular disgusting and very unhygienic. In addition the restaurant was too small to cater for the number of guests at the hotel, which led to a shortage of plates and glasses on a daily basis, the cleanliness of which were also very poor. Water - despite being an all-inclusive package and being able to drink as much alcohol and cocktails that you could knock back, the water had to purchased from vending machines or in the hotel shop at an additional cost. The vending machines were either empty or swallowed your money without spitting out the goods but don't worry, the reception staff were always on hand to tell you to speak to someone else in the morning. Beach - The sand and sea was lovely but beware, if you're brave enough to sit at the beach then be prepared to get hassled by beach vendors selling bling bling , people with poor monkeys trying to take pictures, other folk selling diving trips and excursions, hotel staff touting for water polo or volleyball or maybe just 10 year old annoying children alleging that you've stole their beach towels because they lie on the same beds every day.............not relaxing at all...........!!! Pool - Adults only pool was good but the pool grates were broken so I wouldn't walk on them unless you want to injure yourself. If you want to lie at the main pool then bring ear plugs unless you're a big fan of the macarena being blasted.......(I'm still in my 20's but leave it out, I'm not deaf!!) Facilities - Tennis courts were good, pool bar was rotten, lobby bar was better but not enough seating areas inside the hotel which was necessary to avoid getting wet when it rained at night or bitten to death by insects. Sickness - During the last 3 days of the holiday my partner became quite unwell, displaying symptoms of mild food poisoning.........this was later diagnosed as a large intestine infection..........I've read recent reviews who also refer to similar experiences and I believe that this is a direct result of the poor food hygiene at the hotel......this particular issue should be urgently addressed. To end on a more positive note, I thought the a la carte restaurants were excellent, if you get the chance, the Mediterranean and Mexican were the best.........they were a welcome alternative to the buffet and the quality and presentation of the food was excellent and it was certainly the best part of this holiday except when I was leaving to go home................", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbia, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGood rates.....ok stay.\u201d", "Author": "MIZ10", "ReviewID": "UR115453429", "Content": "Booked this trip last minute...booked Thursday - traveled Sunday.

Corridors can be noisy at night but didn't bother us over the excellent air conditioning. Safe was easy to use and complimentary. Bathroom was good size, large walk in shower and new basins/ taps - looked very modern. We had a fridge but it wasn't stocked. I asked about this and hotel advised as part of waste reduction they supply one bottle of water on you arrival however idea is to fill up bottles from the dispensers around resort which we were happy to do. Never a shortage of room/pool towels. We left tips every few days for the maid where our companions didn't and the service was equal - its up to you. Around the resort tips were never expected but gratefully accepted . We received excellent service at all bars, reception and restaurants, always with a smile. Customer services were also very helpful and printed items free of charge for us. We ate at the main buffet La Terraza and also Miramare (open air), Don Diego, Portofino and Bamboo at the nearby Azteca. All al la cartes were amazing with top notch service - book early. The beef in Portofino in particular deserves a mention. Pool bar was fun although busy when it rained! We enjoyed the lobby bar for the evening and the variety of cocktails on offer was extensive. Resort in a very safe gated community with other hotels and villas. Shopping plaza across the road. Taxis to Playa del Carmen are fixed price US$7 or 70 pesos including tip. Or you can walk in about 20-30 minutes which we did twice. We loved our Cozumel day trip. Taxi to the port 70 pesos, one way ferry ticket about 140 pesos. We rented a Convertible 1972 ish VW convertible bug for the day to drive round the island from Rentadora Isis for $35. No frills, ripped seat, glove box didn't stay shut, speedo a little off but absolutely amazing with your arms in the air listening to the noise of that engine! My husband struggled to give it back. Coconuts bar was a good jolly too... We went to Coba, Chichen Itza and Tulum with a company called Yucatreks booked over the internet - highly recommended and Mitch and Eder took very good care of us. We also went to Xcaret which was great but maybe overpriced. Beach and water at hotel amazing - not much to see snorkel wise but trips go out daily by boat from the hotel dive centre. Entertainment staff work incredibly hard and activities are on all day with an evening show. Solid 3-4 star resort with excellent value for money and friendly staff. PS we worked predominantly in pesos. Most places will take dollars however government has apparently restricted how much an individual or business can bank in dollars per month (so we were told by our mexican rep).

We were originally there May 2010. This time we were there for 5 nights. We had a great trip, but I must say this might be the last time that we stay at the VWM. We didn't have a terrible time, it was just a few things that would sway our vote to stay someplace else the next time. The Good: The Beach. My gosh, beautiful! Not rocky, beautiful aqua water, just breathtaking. The Staff: Great staff. Everybody was very helpful and the woman up front hooked us up with an amazing view of the ocean. It was just beautiful. The shows: Very entertaining. They put a lot of hard work into the shows and it really is quite entertaining. We went every night after dinner. The Grounds: Well taken care of. People are constantly working to keep it clean and tidy. Plus there are lots of little critters to watch roam around the area. The Bad: Food: It seems the quality of food has gone down. Both myself and my boyfriend were sick the last 3 days of our vacation with \"stomach problems.\" We bought bottled water, took pepto with every meal, and still got sick. Plus, the food seriously lacks variety. Same thing, every day. The Water Situation: When we got there we were given one bottle of bottled water. We asked for more, left tips for the maids asking for more water, and still nothing. We even tried to buy some in the vending machines but it was constantly out. We had to take the bikes down to Walmart and get some bottled water eventually. The Shower: You could taste the salt water in the air. Last time we stayed here it seemed like the water was filtered, this time it smelled like it was coming straight from the ocean. The room: There was no mini fridge or alarm clock. Bring your own clock! We asked for both every day we were there and never received one. In addition, it's very, very white. I wish they would paint the area behind the bed to add a little spice to the room. The beds are a little hard but I have a bad back so they didn't really bother me, but I could see how some would find them uncomfortable. Towels: In the room we sometimes got 3 towels, other days we got one. One towel for 2 people? Really? All in all, we had a nice stay.

The beach and grounds are gorgeous, the staff is very friendly and attentive, the food is great and the rooms are extremely nice. We traveled to the Maya for the first time together last January. I had already fallen in love with this resort years ago but I wanted to introduce my future wife to it. She immediately fell in love with it too. When we decided to set a wedding date, it was obvious where we would get married. On the beach at the Viva. Marco was our wedding coordinator. He was absolutely amazing! We cannot put into words how great he was. He took care of everything. From the upgraded room to the welcome package to overseeing the setup on the beach, he did it all. We could not have expected a better wedding. Everything was absolutely perfect. We had 29 guests with us, most of them staying at different locations but they raved about how wonderful the wedding was. Many of them commented to us that the food at the reception was the best they had ever experienced at a wedding. In summary, this was the best. It was absolutely perfect. Most of which we owe to Marco. We honestly cannot thank him enough. If you\u2019re considering getting married in Mexico, go to the Viva Wyndham Maya. Marco will definitely take care of you and you will definitely not regret it. The Mrs edits: Here are some of the finer details my wonderful husband left out: Flowers: Marco had several options available and the extra flowers we ordered were very reasonably priced. The best part was that they lasted well beyond the end of our trip - we were married February 3rd and left on the 8th, the flowers were still as beautiful as the day we got married. Dinner: We ate at the Italian restaurant Miramare which overlooks the beach. The view was spectacular and the food amazing. We chose the tres-leche cake and it was the freshest, moistest wedding cake I have ever had! We also had 2 last minute additions for dinner, Marco was able to get additional food prepared and seats added to the tables to accommodate them (I only noticed they were still around about 5 minutes before we headed upstairs to eat). Planning: This wedding could not have been easier to plan, everything with the exception of the decoration choices was done over email. Marco was always quick to respond to my endless questions. We are from Ontario and this is a first marriage for both of us. The only documents we required were our passports and the tourist cards you receive on your flight. Marco took care of the license and arranging for the blood tests. The doctor did these right on the resort and he too was great. Once we returned we had our marriage certificate translated and I was easily able to have my name changed. Unlike most locations, you receive your certificate the day after the wedding so there is no delay.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood Vacation\u201d", "Author": "Christina0402", "ReviewID": "UR114623712", "Content": "My family and I just got back this weekend and we had a lovely time. We arrived at 2:30am so we were tired and after check in there was no bell boy insight so we were not happy having to bring up 4 suitcases and two 8 yr olds up 4 flights of stairs. We also waited an hour for the bell boy to bring our suitcases for check out and he never showed up! The rooms are standard with NO fridge but we brought our mugs so we just filled them up before heading to the room for the night. The buffet was very good always a good selection of food but it is very hot in there and we liked the fact that we could get our own soft drinks and juice.The snack bar also had a good selection of food and they are open late at night which was great to grab a snack before bed. We went to the Portofino restaurant which was very good the beef was absolutely delicious. The Don Diego was also good and they gave you props to take pictures which was fun. We were also allowed to reserve at the Viva Azteca we chose the Mayan restaurant but do not forget to put bug spray because we were eaten alive by the bugs! The kids club was awesome they open from 7am to 10pm and my kids loved it there lots of activites and they had AC which was great to take a break from the hot sun. They put on a Disney show which all the kids get to be in...it was a fantastic show and my kids had a blast! We rented a car for the week so we did our own outings which was so much cheaper than taking an organized tour. The beach was nice but hard to get some shade if you get there to late. Lots of activites along the beach like jet ski and parasailing which caused some seaweed in the water and we always had a yellow or red flag so be aware of the waves if you have young children. We liked the fact that the resort was not huge so everything was within walking distance. We were in room 2400 and we had a superb view of the ocean which always makes us happy. The 5th avenue is about a 25 minute walk from the hotel or a $7 cab ride well worth it and so much cheaper than the Playacar mall across the street. Wifi is a joke they give you a free card with an access code which only allows you to check your e-mail. If you want to hook up on facebook or twitter they charge you for a card. We did not take it and there is a starbucks in the mall across the street with Wifi! The pool was always crowded which I dislike so I went to the adults only pool at the front of the resort.

Basically, my girlfriend and I returned from the property just a few hours ago and had a fabulous time! The employees are nice and friendly. The rooms are charming yet simple. The food and drinks are delicious. Don't be scared off by the others that have written bad reviews...we had no issues the entire trip. Plus, the property is in Playacar which is a gated compound for many high end resorts so safety is not an issue. Here are some facts that may help: - The resort offered us a 5 hour free wifi connection. You can only use it near the front desk hot spot and they also blocked things like yahoo video chat and Facebook. BUT there is a Starbucks at the front entrance of the resort with in 400 feet of the main entrance...go there, buy a coffee, and they give you the log-in in info for their wifi.....and it seems to not change so you can use it multiple days! - The food was very good but you get what you pay for. The reason most are reading about this resort is the price. You get what you pay for....but I was never disappointed and there selection was very good. - Drinks, they actually served some decent liqours including Bacardi, Skyy vodka, and so on. The beer is one choice, Dos XX and it's draft....but was always cold and always fresh. - Pool and beach were both nice. There's a swim up bar and lots of thatch umbrellas around for those that need shade(like my self). The beach is great with lots of space if needed. - There's tons of activities to partake in including a trapeze! There's also a full stage that the resort uses nightly to put on shows. It's not Vegas or Broadway but the kids that work at the resort do try very hard and the shows were entertaining. There is also archery, painting of your own pottery plates(and other stuff), nice gym, and really lots more. The bottom line is, it's worth the money. This is my 4th trip to Mexico but first time at this resort and 1st time for Playacar. We'll be back for sure....it's just a matter of when! One last thing, we used USA Transfers. It was $109 for a round trip for 2. You don't have to share the vehicle...just go when you get there!

I walked along the beach starting at 5th Avenue back to the Wyndham Maya and found a lot of the competing hotel beaches to be littered with trash, full of sand fleas or right next to the large cruise ships. Also, many hotels didn\u2019t have shaded areas on the beach which were a blessing. PROS: \u2022 Great location!

Also, the purpose of our trip was to experience the Mayan culture through visits to the ruins so we were not picky with food/drinks and accommodations. Overall, our stay at VWM from June 6-13th was fantastic! Having read the reviews, I knew what to expect, came prepared and optimistic and had the most wonderful time. I would highly recommend this resort! In terms of specifics: Resort: I loved the layout of the resort. Very conveniently accessible, regardless of where your room was. We were in the 2100 block, close to the stage, snack bar, pool and beach. We were never disturbed by the noise levels as we attended the nightly entertainment shows. The flora and fauna are exceptional! Definitely the best part\u2026I can see why this resort is a green eco-friendly resort. Lush trees and vegetation, great to take pictures in\u2026we basically took every angle! VWM also had a trapeze that we tried once\u2026a bit scary but amazing experience\u2026an added bonus! Room: Very basic room. We had no fridge, free use of the safe and no clock\u2026which I knew from reading the reviews beforehand. Loved the Mexican-inspired d\u00e9cor. Soft beds and flat screen TV. We were given 2 water bottles on the first day. Knowing that no more water bottles were to be given, we left a nice tip and kindly asked for 2 more water bottles the next day\u2026got them. Every morning, we would refill the 4 bottles with purified water at the snack bar pool. We would use it to brush our teeth. No problem in going out of our way for a bit to minimize waste and our ecological footprint! Service: The staff was very friendly, always saying \u201chola!\u201d We cannot think of even one instance where we had bad service or a poor attitude, even from the front desk, which I was well aware of after reading the reviews. The animation team was also great, very energetic and they appeared to really love their jobs. Food: It was standard buffet fare for all three meals. Of course, eating eggs, pasta and meat all the time can be repetitive so we tried to sample some new foods. Every day had a different food theme. The snack bar was quite nice \u2013 tasty thin-crust oven pizza that went fast! We dined at 2 a la cartes. The Mediterranean one had a very impressive ambiance and the Mexican one was more laidback. Both a la cartes allowed you to select an appetizer, entr\u00e9e and dessert from their menu\u2026very much like a fancy restaurant\u2026but for free! We had no trouble booking it\u2026booked in the morning and afternoon\u2026the girl was very helpful and friendly. Drinks: We\u2019re not crazy alcoholics and did not visit the Riviera Maya for free alcohol. Nonetheless, we were impressed with the drinks selection. Every bar had a drinks menu posted up so it made ordering and sampling new drinks easy. I did not feel they were watered down. Great bar service. Entertainment: The nightly 1-hour entertainment shows were worth it. The dancers were great, loved the choreographer, Isabella, because she was such a fun and talented performer! They put a lot of effort into the shows with nicely timed group choreography, sound, lighting, smoke and even a circus component in one show. We were very impressed! Pool: We only swam in the \u201cnoisy\u201d pool and seriously, it\u2019s not that noisy...unless you\u2019re 80! It was never super crowded, always easy to find a beach chair and a spot in the pool to swim in. The water temperature varied from cool to warm\u2026never uncomfortable. Beach: We only visited a few times during non-peak hours. Lovely waters to frolick in! There were also no beach vendors. Of course, many people decided to do the infamous \u201ctowel game\u201d where beach chairs were saved, even though there was a sign explicitly forbidding it! Safety: Loved that VWM was in the gated Playacar community. Tons of resorts in the Playacar community as we walked to 5th Avenue where all the shops, restaurants and souvenirs are. Felt very safe to walk in it. Excursions: This was my 2nd all-inclusive experience so I knew that booking excursions at the resort was costly, at roughly $100/person. We had three excursions, all booked in different manners. The 1st one (Chichen Itza, buffet lunch, cenote swimming, Valladolid for $50/person) was booked on 5th Avenue with Orange Travel & Tours, a little kiosk. The promoter, Arturo Garcia Lopez, was great, recognized our hesitation in booking with a small company and even said \u201cdon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re not bandidos!\u201d Hahaha! After making a deposit, we were nervous about them ripping us off, being a no-show or selling our organs but all turned out well. We accidentally slept in on the day of the tour and called Arturo right away as he said to reschedule for the next day, thank goodness with no trouble. We had a great time! The 2nd one (ziplining, canoeing, rapelling, cenote swimming, buffet lunch, Coba for $83/person) was booked at a kiosk in the Playacar Plaza across the street from VWM. We bartered with the promoter, Victor Tovar, got a discount but should\u2019ve asked for a deeper discount. An awesome experience overall because we only had 6 people on the tour so it made for an intimate environment when doing activities. However, still a bit pricier than booking on 5th Avenue\u2026unfortunately, Orange Travel & Tours did not offer a tour that combined a visit to a Mayan ruins with ziplining. The 3rd one (Tulum for $15) was dirt cheap because we took the Greyhound-like bus from the bus terminal on 5th Avenue! It\u2019s a 1-hour bus ride to Tulum, round trip bus fare was $10/person and admission to Tulum was $5/person. Even when adding a meal, it was still much more economical! We really wanted to see Tulum to have the 3 main Mayan ruins crossed off our checklist\u2026absolutely worth it! Some tips to make your stay worthwhile: - Bring a clock/watch. It is awkward to have no concept of time so make sure to bring one. We also made use of wake-up calls from the front desk. - If shopping for personal necessities or souvenirs, buy it on 5th Avenue. The Playacar Plaza across the street was still quite expensive\u2026don\u2019t even try buying from the shop in the resort! You can barter on 5th Avenue, tons of selection\u2026buy souvenirs and book your excursions on 5th Avenue, guaranteed at least \u00bd the price! We only went for a couples massage on 5th Avenue. The ladies from Kristine Playacar Beauty Centre & Spa (kiosk on the right as soon as you walk past the gates) were very friendly. At 200 pesos per person per hour, it was a steal! - PLEASE REMEMBER TO TIP! You are on vacation and the staff work very hard and bend over backwards to make you happy. It does not hurt to show your gratitude and appreciation, especially when most people depend on tips for their livelihood. Before leaving, we bought 40 $1 US bills at the bank for tipping. We made sure to tip our maid everyday ($3 US or 30 pesos), half the time that we ordered drinks from the bar ($1-2 US), the bellboys (40 pesos before we left), the a la carte restaurants (100 pesos per reservation), the excursions ($5 CDN per driver and tour guide), the masseuse ($5 CDN per masseuse) and the shuttle bus service (20 pesos for the driver). We ended up tipping a lot but at the end of the day, the money did not mean as much to us as it does to them. Don\u2019t be stingy! During this stay, I have NEVER seen so many people not tip in my life! If you can shell out almost $1000 for your vacation, I\u2019m sure you can spare a few dollars here and there to tip\u2026SO PLEASE TIP!", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Banff", "Title": "\u201cMy friend and I loved VWM and would return\u201d", "Author": "BanffyBanff", "ReviewID": "UR113917596", "Content": "*I am reposting this review after editing it to fix a mistake about the good room #'s* Before I start this review I should disclose that both my friend and I work as front desk managers of (different) hotels in a popular Canadian ski town, which I think makes us more lenient AND more critical when staying at hotels. Anyway, knowing that making a request for anything before arrival always improves your chances of recieving it, we asked for a \"nice room with a view\" when we made the reservation. ROOMS: We were delighted to find our room in the 2200 section with a patio on beautiful grounds and a great view of the pool/ocean. I would reccommend getting a patio over a balcony room for sure; if you are an animal lover there are all kinds of agoutis, iguanas and tropical birds hanging around (even the rare coati sometimes). The room itself was better than expected; nothing luxurious but clean and simple with more than enough room for the two of us. Only downside is the walls are paperthin; we could hear everything from the neighboring room and hallway. Also, if you want a room close the all the action, keep in mind there are nightly shows which go on until about 11:30pm, so if you go to bed early, that might be an issue for you. BEACH: The most important feature for us was the beach which was impeccable; absolutely beautiful. White sand, turquoise water, and free of seaweed. While it's true many of the loungers in the shade are taken early, don't forget the sun moves throughout the day; so then does the shade! It's absolutely ridiculous that one reviewer said you have to reserve a chair at 3am or they are taken by 5am, that's just not true. The resort does not allow night swimming in either the ocean or pool which was disapointing. STAFF/ACTIVITIES/ENTERTAINMENT: The staff at the resort are amazing. Each day they organize dance lessons, water aerobics, beach vollyball, bocce ball, spanish lessons and much more. The only bad experience was archery, which was run by a guy who seemed annoyed as soon as he had to show me what to do. Every night there is a show; we saw \"70's\", \"Hollywood\", \"Las Vegas\" and a gameshow parody; some were just ok and some were great. It's worth noting that the same staff who run the activities during the day perform in the shows at night; they sing, dance, act and even do trapeze acts, and they do it well considering this is an inclusive feature of the hotel. These are not professionals, but very talented amateurs! The front desk, concierge and gift shop staff were all very average- they weren't rude but weren't friendly either. I think they should improve their customer service skills to be a bit more engaging with guests. FOOD/DRINKS: I have to agree with most folks about the mediocre food. There was a lot of it; even if the buffet was closed, the snack bar stocked lots of food, but the quality was just ok. I didn't mind this too much since I'm not there for a culinary experience and just needed some food to fill my gut. The buffet staff are very quick to refresh tables and even refill your drink if you want. Gabriel was especially amusing! We ate at the Mexican and Mediterranean la carte restaurants and they were both fine, I liked the Mediterranean one more though. The alcoholic drinks were probably watered down, but I liked this actually. If you want to get drunk it won't be hard, but if you want to stay hydrated and get a buzz-on, you can drink all day without having to pass out, lol. Overall, this is a great resort. If you want luxury look elsewhere, but if you just want an affordable place to stay with a great beach and lots to do, this is a perfect option. I would come back in a heartbeat.

I feel that the length of the stay was the perfect amount and will run down the pros and cons of both the resort as well as the activities we participated in during our stay. We booked this vacation through jetBlue Getaways which was a very positive experience. It was air, hotel, ground transportation, taxes and fees all combined into one package. When we arrived in Cancun, our transportation was provided by TourEx. If you've ever walked out of the Cancun airport, I'm sure you know how hectic it can be. We had a uniformed driver waiting for us with our name on a sign. It was very easy to locate and we only shared a vehicle with one other couple. Travel time from airport to the resort was 45 minutes (including the one stop we made to drop off the other couple). When we arrived at the resort, there was no line and the check-in process was simple with no issues. We were greeted with champagne and provided room keys, bracelets and a friendly overview of the resort and how things worked. That was followed by a bellboy that took our luggage to the room while showing us the grounds and explaining how things worked along the way. There are three restaurants on site (Mexican, Italian and Mediterranean), several bars, pools and activities as well as nightly shows at 9:30PM. ROOM: We stayed in room 1201 which had a private balcony with private jacuzzi, ocean view and two lounge chairs. Mini bar was stocked with water and soda and room was newly renovated with great shower, shower hooks, properly functioning toilet and more. The room had a flat screen TV mounted on the wall and a closet with safe. Everything in the room was wonderful minus the bed and linens. There was never a fitted sheet on the bed covering the mattress, only a flat sheet that was tucked into the sides. I'm sure you can guess how long that lasted and every night after, we found ourselves laying directly on the mattress... which is gross. The other negative about the bed were the pillows. There were no pillowcases and you had to lie directly on the pillow... another \"eww\" moment. Our room was located at the end of the hall so we didn't run into any noise issues, etc. FOOD: Let me preface this section to let you know we live and work in the heart of Manhattan and could probably be referred to as \"food snobs\". My opinion on this section may be slightly harsh. All three restaurants that we had dinner at during our stay were great. The Mediterranean was the best, followed by the Mexican and Italian last. The first two were surprisingly delicious but the Italian left a lot to be desired. All drinks and entrees were good and the menus are served as a pre-fixe. I stayed away from the beef the entire trip (just because it's Mexico and you never know) and really enjoyed the chicken dishes at all dinners. Deserts are a different story and something this resort just doesn't do very well. Here's the downside to the food at Viva Maya: the buffet. This is where you eat the majority of your meals (all breakfast and lunch meals are served here as well as dinner nights without a reservation). The buffet was clean and neat, it was just the food that wasn't that great. The majority of it didn't look appetizing to us but the majority of the guests had their plates LOADED so apparently it's not all that bad. The main problem I had with the food was the way it looked and lack of flavor. All said, there is fruit and always some sort of Mexican dish (tacos, enchiladas, etc) that you can default to. The pasta bar was good and there's always french fries. On top of the buffet, there is also a snack bar located by the pool that always seemed to be serving up pizza, burgers and fries. Bottom line on the food: It's not going to be the best thing you ever eat (I hope) but you won't go hungry during your stay. DRINKS: The resort has several bars where all alcohol is included. While you don't have to tip, I am always curious why people wouldn't do this. Set aside $25 on your trip in dollar bills and slip the guy a buck every few times you go up. These guys work hard and deserve a dollar here and there for keeping you hydrated... or buzzed. While the cups are small (probably 8oz), my partner and I discussed this and realized that they are actually the perfect size to keep your drinks cool. If they were any larger, you would have a lot of waste with either hot or watered down drinks. All of the alcohol isn't horrible and they even have SKYY on the bar that you can have your drinks made with upon request. Our favorite drinks were Lemon Daiquiris (made with SKYY), Mai Tai's and the Chi-Chi. ACTIVITIES: While we don't have a family, we definitely noticed lots of families (not too many to where it was annoying) and commented how perfect this place would be if you had a family. Lots to do, no additional money for activities, food or drink, etc. The resort had an entire staff dedicated to activities and entertaining the guests that were very present the entire visit. If they weren't teaching salsa lessons by the pool, they were playing beach volleyball or playing on the trapeze. On top of the games and dedicated entertainment team, they also have an activities team that deals with the water sports taking you out to windsurf, boogie board and kayak. All included at no additional fee. There are also jet ski rentals and parasailing for an additional fee. The jet skis were a rip in my opinion, $65 US per half hour... NON NEGOTIABLE. Now I'm always under the impression in Mexico that EVERYTHING is negotiable but these guys didn't budge more than $5 or $10 bucks. So I walked. The resort is located a 20 minute walk from \"Fifth Avenue\" which is an upscale shopping area and also traditional Mexican market. We walked thru this area and if you're looking for cocaine or weed, this is the place to go. I must have been offered \"coca\" about 15 times in 15 minutes. I'm a mid-twenty's male so maybe that's why. FYI, the resort also had bikes that you could take for free to this area that you just check out. It was a 5-10 minute bike ride through the gated community where the resort is located. There are also a few nice restaurants along the way once you reach Fifth Avenue, if you're looking for a break from the buffet at the resort, try taking a bike here in the morning for a delicious and traditional Mexican breakfast. We also did two \"excursions\" that were additional money but set up by the hotel that has an Excursions desk and representative on site next to the front desk. You just go up and talk to the staff member and they'll show you a book of TONS of different things you can do in the area. They set it all up and print you our receipts with details. The first day we did the Dolphin Swim which was about $100 US per person and worth every penny. That included transportation to and from, and the deluxe package where you swim with two dolphins in a small group for about 40 minutes and also get to swim with Manatees and sharks. This was by far one of the coolest things we have ever done. Took about four hours from pick up to drop off. The next day we went on a half day snorkeling excursion with a group of nine others. We had one guide the entire day and spent the first half of the day exploring an underground cave that was millions of years old. Stalagmites, stalagtites and freshwater exploration of a place that is literally millions of years old. We have never experienced anything like this and were blown away and left with the taste for more. After the cave, we went to the ocean where we swam with giant sea turtles through a coral reef. We swam about ten feet away from five huge turtles, many fish, rays and more. Another truly amazing experience. They also had a photographer following us on both with photos for purchase at the end ($25 US). The final thing I'll touch on under the \"Activities\" portion of this review are the nighttime shows and late-night disco on site at the resort. While these nightly shows at 9:30PM are not quite ready for Broadway yet, they are very entertaining and you have to applaud the staff's hard work and dedication to these shows. There is also a disco on site that opens at 11PM, we stopped by one night and there were only three people there... so we left. DEMOGRAPHICS: As Americans, I am happy to say that we were the minority at this resort. During one of the shows, they did a \"Country role-call\" which showed us about 50% of the guests were European (majority Italian, French or English), 25% Canadian and 25% American. Lots of languages, several families and a good mix of people stayed here. As a gay couple, we didn't feel out of place at all. BEACH: Lots of chairs and a really great beach. The sand was nice and the waves were a ton of fun to play in. I read in many reviews that you need to arrive early for a chair in the shade but didn't notice this issue at all. POOL: Two pools and a kids area with a swim up bar. The pool was clean and a nice break from the ocean. GREAT people watching. SPA: We did a couple's massage that was mediocre at best. I get massages often and didn't feel this was worth the price. STAFF: The staff was all great. We didn't run into a single attitude or issue with the staff. All spoke English and were bilingual. We had several staff members approach us throughout the stay just to talk and see how we were enjoying our stay. BOTTOM LINE: For the price that we paid, I was expecting way less. This resort over-delivered on my low expectations and left me with a very positive experience that I would recommend to friends. Would I go back? Sure... if I was looking to save money. However, if I had more to spend next time, I would probably look into something a bit more high-brow with better food and Heinz ketchup.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cHad a great trip.\u201d", "Author": "oreol0l", "ReviewID": "UR112984888", "Content": "We just got back from this place and have to say was very impressed.

We met lots of nice people and drank our fair share. There were some people who were a bit drunk rowdy but for the most part we found the atmosphere pretty good. The night shows were a bit cheezy, and in fact the best night was the Mr Maya contest ad not a show at all. The 4 guys had to do a push up contest, modelling walks, pop the balloon with their gf/wife contest and a dress up like a female artist and lip sync. The guy who did \"Shakira\" and was wearing a thong underwear that you could see through his costume won and it was a riot. Did 2 excursions: Coba and a 3-location snorkel in the ocen and 2 cenotes.

The room was nice and clean but smelled so musty and moldy that it bothered our nose. There is no fridge in the room and we got only 1 bottle of water and 2 7UPs for the whole stay, even we tipped the maid very well. Had to purchase water for $5/bottle. A/C worked well. The food: First of all let me say, we are not picky eaters and eat pretty much everything but never had a really good food the whole time.The buffet was very small and had the same tastless food every single day. They served only one kind of fish and no seafood at all! There is only one pasta staion but there was a mile long line, so we didn't eat pasta the whole stay.For the 5days, you can make 2 restaurant reservations. The mexican restaurant was awful, the appertizer taco was so dry, I couldn't even bite on it . I have way better mexican food in my hometown restaurant.The italian restaurant was excellent. The last 2 days instead of celebrating my husband's Birthday, we got very sick. We drank only bottled water, maybe from the food? We had stomach ache, chilles, bad diarrhea and got very weak. Barely made it back to the States...I'm still recuperating today. The beach is beautiful and kept very clean. lots of palapas, no problem there. The hotel ground looks like an eco resort but not kept up very well. They don't have irrigation,so they use hoses all day to water the plants. Dead, dry leaves are everywhere, not cleaned up. We went to the famous 5th Ave but hated it. Sales people are very pushy, you can't even walk in peace, every second you have to say: \"No, thank you\". One guy we said no, thanks to goes: \"That's how you treat the poor mexicans?\" We love to help local people but it was too much... Also visited Tulum and Coba, we had fun.

This year a group of 35 from 3 years to 46 years of age joined in on our end of school year Playa Bash! It was the best trip to date. We arrived around 2:30 and had an easy check in so for those that are a family of 4 and complain, I have to laugh. We were 35 and it was smooth. We immediately went to the buffet to grab some food. There is a wide variety of choices. You have to remember that this place caters for Europeans, Mexicans, South Americans and many North American palates. They do a little of everything to keep everyone happy. Sadly, the only people I ever saw complain were Americans. You are in a foreign country, let your guard down and try something different. If anything...we all gained weight. We then checked into our rooms which were located in the 1000 block. We had one single and his room was situated right on the beach with a king size bed. All of our rooms were spacious and very clean. Mattress was a bid hard but still comfortable. We had a mini fridge stocked with Pepsi brands and water daily. When we asked for more water, they graciously gave us more. We had a coffee maker and a flat screen TV. We also had an alarm clock. I was shock because I read these reviews and our rooms were nothing like they described. The bathrooms were comfortable size with a glass shower. Now, the hot water was lukewarm at best but it was also quite refreshing. We hit the beach and after walking the entire beach...Viva Maya has the best beach by far. I felt like I was in heaven. Pool bar was great. When we ordered a drink I just told them the brand I wanted. They do have house brands used for basic drinks but you want your Absolut or Sky Vodka just ask for it. The entertainment staff kept us busy and we participated in several of the games. One of our kids went to the kids club and had a ball and a few did the trapeze and lived out a circus moment. One day 17 of us grabbed bikes (free) and headed into town. It is a comfortable ride into town and I suggest skip the taxi's and just bike to town. You can lock them up near the McDonalds on 5th Ave. This isn't a 4 star by no means but the rooms were comfortable, food was good, drinks were cold and the best beach ever.

They tried their best to supply us with options at every meal in the one and only restaurant, which catered for the whole resort which meant you had to get there quick for a good table, but the food was blend and overcooked. The a-la-carte restaurants were good though. Too bad you could only eat there 3x times during your 1 week stay. Make sure you reserve all 3 restaurants when you arrive! Wifi - do not trust the 'free wifi' cards you receive at the reception. They do not work!! I received a huge bill on my return home eventhough I had only used the free wifi in the reception area which obviously hadn't worked!!! Rooms - clean and tidy but so noisy!

Service was amazing your plates were cleared away immediatly and drinks were flowing!! very very clean also. we visited all restaurants on site and can say that the mexican restaurant was by far the best for service and food. Italian pool reastaurant was probs my least likeable reastaurant as one waiter was a little off and made us feel rushed but food was excellent. Entertainment, Different show every night that catered for everyone really good dancing and costumes also visited the disco which was very entertaining night. Activities galore in the day vollyball, dancing, watersports and fittness nothing to complain at. Rooms rooms were lovely and spacious double sinks seperate toilet area, iorn, hair dryer and big tv with lots of english channels! rooms were tied and cleaned daily with small animals made out of towels on bed different one everyday!! this is my only down point with the room is it smelt a little musty which i did tell the hotel reception about when we were leaving. Grounds, grounds were very well kept hard working grounds men around at all times, lots af beautiful plants and flowers, massive layout and relax pool was also brill very quite and laid back away from the action were you could just relax with your own bar!!.

The location of the room was pretty good we were in the 2000's nice and central for the beach and lobby area, we booked the a la cartes with no problem , the mexican and italian were pretty poor and the house wine was like vinegar, so we had to spend a little for a decent bottle, the miramare was the nicest but still nothing to shout about, the buffet was ok, but got very tiring and stale we ended up eating out in PDC a few nights i must say though Armando the waiter was excellent, we never waited more than 5 seconds for a drink and he was always cheerful, unlike the miserable guys in the blue shirts, that look like security very rude . The shows were ok but i have been to Mexico 3 times and this was so cheesy and boring apart from the trapeze artists they were really good, they need to get in traditional mexican dancers to spice it up . Toward the end of our holiday i noticed how unfriendly the Viva shop staff are , apart from being really expensive anyway you would think that an \"Hola\" would not be too much to ask but the staff just look at you when you are waiting to pa,y as if you are bothering them and i had a very bad experiance with Nicte a women that works in the mornings there , i think she is possibly the rudest person i have met and i have travelled alot she seriously needs some customer service training oh and manners !! The activities were good in the day volleyball etc , overall this holiday was good but only because of the weather and the beach , our last few days were not as good just because there was an invasion of loud americans especially 1 girl who could not string a sentance together without a F@\"k or something else just as vile and she made sure everyone else heard her !! . There was some lovely people from all over but watch out for the young loud guys and gals, vulgar !! I feel this hotel could be better the shop staff need sacking, the room service needs updating (there is none ). I would rate this as a 3* not a 4* i will go back to PDC but i would not go back to this hotel you can get some great 4/5 * hotels for that little bit more.. 1 More point to add when leaving the country expect long delays we spent 3 hours for check in, booked seats or no,t had to run to boarding so no time for duty free, and DO NOT fly with Thoms cook they are the worst airline i have ever travelled with appalling food , no service , TV /Films didnt work , useless and tiny seats.

Ok check in easy very polite staff Mia was helpful we arrived about 40mins before we could check into our room but no big deal. When we got to the room it is nice beds were comfortable ( I like firm mattress) room 1324 Like another traveler mentioned get an even number room. Beach is beautiful didn't want to get out of the water. Very relaxing Now for the bad which may out way the good depending on your expectations Upon check in we were asked if we wanted to upgrade to VIP $60 a night per room But because the room available only had a king bed I decided not but then front desk said well I will give you parcial ocean view and VIP wristbands for $20 per night per person (there are two of us) wish I didn't need to spend the money but glad we did. So we get our wristbands the allows you access to Wyndham Aztec as well We also got our free wifi card but we were not told until we went back to the front desk that you have to buy another card for Facebook access because they block it so that was another $25 (it should have been included in the price for VIP access!) now come to find out when we went over to the Aztec Facebook is not blocked from their Internet access very sneaky of the Maya! Do not use the main pool the water is 120 degrees very gross!! But bright spot was the quiet pool although there was some serious construction going on it was most certainly better than the main pool and the water was much cleaner and cooler. In fact that is were I will be going today our last day here. Now onto the food all I can say is if there is a health inspector he would throw up! Buffet was GROSS!!! At the Maya no air-conditioning poor service staff dripping sweat so hot you cannot breath. Now I was not expecting much because of other reviews but unsafe working conditions for the staff and unsafe storage of the food I was not expecting. Thank god we purchased the VIP bands we were able to go to the Aztec and use their amenities including buffet which was much cleaner and the food was better. But still not air-conditioned. We are staying 4nights and we were only allowed 1 restaurant dining reservation (WTF)!! That is a very unfair policy and I was not happy about! Our last day and still have not been able to dine in a restaurant. Soo all and all we went to town and ate and they have free wifi in alot of the bigger establishments Senior Frogs was great drinks, food and free wifi we also watched game one of stanlycup finals at tequila Barrel with 50 Cannucks fans (we are Bruins Fans) two of only 6 in the bar and we had a great time! Shout Out to Vancuver Fans!!! Great food,great service and free wifi There is a DQ on 5th between 6&8 So my review is if you are looking for value at the Wyndham stay at the Aztec not the Maya because they are around the same price.

From the first day of checking in to the last day of check out. The employees (guest services and receptionist only) where unfriendly and not very welcoming. For example, when talking to Guest Services on three different occasions it seemed like they could not be bothered. When checking out the receptionist was rude and very short with us this may have been because a group was checking in and they seemed to be short staffed. My wife and I werent asking for everyone to be happy go lucky but expected at least a basic sense of hospitality and received none. Additionally, the pool staff/entertainment can be very annoying especially when you are trying to relax at the pool or beach. When laying on the beach they would come around asking multiple times if you wanted to sign up for darts or excercise or some other activity they wanted to get people to do. We are a young couple and love to do activities but the constant pestering got to be too much.

I want to say that this review may sound negative as I'm pointing out many things I did not like about it. I've stayed at a few other AI's and this one didn't rate as well even though I paid about the same price. However, my kids thought it was awesome (it was their first AI resort). Having said that, if this is your first AI holiday, you may be happy enough as you have nothing to compare it too but if you've been to other places, you may be disappointed. At times, I felt like it was a \"step up from camping\" - which is what I was going to title this review until my kids insisted I change it as they liked the place and didn't want my review to discourage others from trying this hotel. Accommodations \u2013 The rooms were alright for the most part. Our room had a terrible sewer odour and we were on the 3rd floor. I have smelled this in other hotels as well, not sure what it is. Our balcony was quite rusted. I almost offered to slap a quick coat of paint on it myself so I didn\u2019t need to look out at it every day. Got used to it by day 3. Otherwise, the rooms were very bare bones. There were towel animals on the bed about 3/7 days which was great, I was thinking we may not get any. The kids enjoyed them. Sometimes, our towels were plentiful and other times, taken away and not replaced. We were given 1 bottle with a printed note that said we could refill it at the bar or purchase more in the gift shop if we wanted. I was able to get a couple extra bottles of water when I left a note. I don\u2019t mind being eco-friendly but 1 bottle of water for a week is insufficient. I think it should be at least 1 bottle per person plus 1 for toothbrushing \u2013 3 bottles/week, at least. I\u2019ve since heard some people say they got 1 bottle a day so maybe they changed that policy. BEDS were VERY comfortable! Restaurants - I found the restaurants disappointing. First, it was difficult and stressful trying to get a dinner reservation for alacartes (especially for the Azteca restaurants). The only times were early 6-6:30 or late 8:30-9:00-ish. We had a large party - 7 of us and we were accomodated but it did seem like it was a big deal when I didn't think it should be. The woman that helped us was AMAZING! She really gave us 1st class service to satisfy our request to eat together at the ala cartes. She saved the holiday from disaster as this was really important to us.....The food at the Mexican and Italian at the VWM was not that great, but we loved everything we ordered at Portofino (mediteranean). Late night eats - there was a gap between when the restaurant closed and the late night beach buffet opened (from 10pm-11pm) where there was no food. Unfortunate as thats when the shows end and would be nice to have a snack before you retire. BUT the pizza was real hot and delicious when it did come out! We arrived late one night - after 3am and there were still putting out hot pizza and wings...we were pleased! The buffet restaurant on site was ok. We were not allowed to eat at the Azteca buffet which was disappointing as it was partly outside. There was no ambiance in ours - brightly lit, very loud, cafeteria atmosphere. After a few days, I stuck to the freshly grilled station for the best stuff. Also at breakfast, the cook to order egg and omelette stations were great. Just don't mistake eggplant for mushrooms when picking your omelette filling - yuck...my bad. They really should find a replacement for the \u201cmargarine\u201d in the restaurant. It was always rock hard (impossible to spread) and tasted dreadful. Cream for coffee would be appreciated as well. Now I know that there is 101 ways to serve left over hot dogs. These turned up at least once or twice a day in each of the buffets. Not sure if others were eating these dishes but made the buffet look like they were really trying to stretch their budget. No room service. As told there was but there\u2019d be a charge and I had to call back in morning, and then when I did, I was told that there is no room service at all. Service \u2013 The staff were friendly and accommodating. The only staff I thought had a poor attitude or were not very helpful were the guest services guy trying to help? with dinner reservations and the guy at the viva circus trapeze (both not customer service friendly). Grounds \u2013 Very well maintained and beautiful \u2013 I would rate this very high. Drinks \u2013 We don\u2019t really drink top shelf liquors but do prefer Bailey\u2019s and Kahlua over the generic kind available. I thought Kahlua would be cheap enough in Mexico that the resort would have it on hand, but did not. Activities \u2013 Lots to do but limited to the hours they post. For instance, if you want to do things like rock climbing, archery, trapeze, kayaking, catamaran etc, there was a certain time posted and you could only do at that time. On the only day where it was a yellow flag day, the catamaran was out and I asked about getting a ride on it or kayaking and was told that a storm was coming in so we could not do it anymore that day. The other resorts in the area all had theirs out, not sure why we couldn\u2019t have done the same (no storm hit afterall). There didn\u2019t end up being a storm either. Major issues \u2013 The pool area is dangerously slippery. It would not cost much to run a mat (similar to those in front of the counter at the bar) from the beach to the pool bar. This is the slipperiest area and people are constantly wiping out. You can\u2019t cover the entire area in a mat but this is a high traffic pathway. *Please find a replacement for the \u201cmargarine\u201d in the restaurant. I survived but a nice tasting toast n the am would help a lot. I also like butter on potatoes, rice, and veggies but didn't as this would ruin the taste of the food. Summary: My major complaints about this resort are: - Horrible margarine in restaurant - Booking at ala cartes difficult to get times or days. - No coffee makers in rooms - No cream for coffee - No room service Best things about resort: - Bit cheaper than other AI's in the area - Kids liked the activities like the trapeze - Beautiful beach area (butt crowded (lots of butts in sand - shame on you smokers) - Nicely laid out grounds, not too large - Some awesome staff - Great location (in Playacar) OVERALL I would not recommend as I feel many people may be disappointed with this resort especially if they've stayed mostly at 4 star hotels.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver BC, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLoved most of it..some things just so so\u201d", "Author": "bbcg", "ReviewID": "UR109732082", "Content": "Just returned from Viva Wyndham Maya for 12 days with our 2 kids.

Most of our holiday was fabulous with the exception of a few things and I will talk about those first. Check in was a slow and annoying process. After our long flight, we were hot and tired and having to cue up for what felt like 45 minutes seemed ridiculous considering there were only a few others infront. I can't imagine what it would be like if a whole bus load of guests arrived at the same time. The front desk staff really does need to speed it up a bit. We requested 2 rooms with a connecting door, but were given 2 rooms side by side. So,back to the front desk we went. Finally and hour later and dripping in sweat, we got the connecting room we had requested. In the end, we got a fantastic room facing the ocean. The room was comfortable for us and it was close enough to the pool for the kids to come and go as they pleased.. Oh, and what a view!! I'll never forget it. The shower in our room smelled of sewage when the water was turned on, but there was no way we were going up to the front desk to change again , so we just used the shower in the kids room. Problem solved. The floor in the room would also get kind of slippery, almost oily, but we discovered if you left the airconditioning on, the floor dried up. The buffet was not bad, we always found something to eat. Breakfast was great.The one thing I hated was the margarine instead of butter pats. I'd rather do without than eat bad margarine. All 4 of us also did get sick, but fortunately (with the help of pepto) it only seemed to last a day and we were still able to enjoy our holiday. Sometimes when travelling, you have to take the good with the bad, and for us, the good at Viva Wyndham outweighed the bad. The entertainment staff is the most excellent and hardworking group of energetic young people. They really make this hotel the fun place it is. There is lots going on to keep you entertained from morning until night. The beach is so amazing and the carribean turquoise water just beautiful to swim in. The pools are a nice temperature and clean.. As far as people reserving chairs with towels for shade, it seems you better be quick on your toes to get a spot in the am or you may be sitting in the sun. Luckily we are early risers so we were at the pool early enough to get a shady spot, we did observe others disappointed that there was no shady spots left. I would suggest to the hotel to build some more palapas around the pool. Loved the cappucinos in the morning by the pool. Lunch by the pool was good too. Brick oven pizza is great. We took an excursion to Chichen Itza purchased from the booth by the Starbucks out front. It's cheaper than the hotel and I believe its the exact same trip. Chichen Itza was breathtaking but unbelievably hot! Remember if you go, to take water, a hat and sunscreen and cover up to avoid sunburn. You can also rent umbrellas there for $3.00. I'm not kidding.. its a cooker there! Swimming in the cenote after was so much fun and the highlight for the kids. The restaurants were all good and a nice break from the buffet We booked our first morning there and had no problems booking for all at the same time. The italian at the Azteca Mexican at the Maya were the best. Overall this is a great 3.5 star hotel.It's not super fancy, but we did not go in expecting that. Staff for the most part are friendly and helpful. Remember to tip. Especially the maids and bartenders. They really appreciate it and a few extra pesos or $$`s every now and then you will get a little extra special service! It really is a beautiful property and if you don't let minor disturbances bother you, and look to the positive you will enjoy yourself the Viva Wyndham.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "brandon,ms", "Title": "\u201cGood but not excellant\u201d", "Author": "shetray", "ReviewID": "UR109724422", "Content": "I am going to be short and direct. Just arrived home from Viva wyndham maya. First of all, I did alot of research before I left on this trip and thought I was making the best choice for my family. Readers, olease note where the people are from that are making the reviews. We are from America and have never traveled out of the states until now so here we go..... The hotel: Rooms were probrably on the days inn level. NOTE: They do not have wash clothes there, so unless you want to bathe with your hand, take you some. Beds are fine. I like lots of heavy covers but you only get a couple of sheets and a thin blanket. Our room was in a great location though, right at the pool and beach. Room 1113. Beach: Awesome! Vivid aqua colors. But beware MOMS, there are alot of europeans at this resort and the ladies like to go topless! We tried to shield our 9 yr old boy as much as we could. Food : We didn't know that there was a dress code for the ala carte restraunts, so we couldn't eat there. Buffets were ok. We had to figure out what to eat. I know why America is the fattest country because we know how to cook, mexicans not so much. But it was ok. Resort Grounds: Beautiful Staff: Super friendly! Kids Club: Great. My son asked to go and didn't want to leave, sometimes. Pool: We only went to the one by the beach. It was nice but crowded and loud. Bar and Bartenders: No complaints, well only one. They only had draft beer , and it tasted watered down. Activities: Numerous, we went sailing and it was awesome. Also, we played bingo and the hubby won! If you don't do anything else, go to AXUL restraunt. Its a restraunt in a cave! Absolutley Amazing!!!!! One more thing, I don't know if they have anything like the FDA in Mexico but the food at the snack bar sat out all day and they kinda grossed me out. Would we go again?, No, but only because we have been there and done it. We had an awesome tim all and all. Lastly, we live in Mississippi and thought that we would be used to the humidity but no, it was 10x worse. Also they don't have diet mountain dew or mountain dew period in mexico! We are addicted so that sucked. Hidden Worlds Adventure Park: It was ok.

Can't get over what we got for the very reasonable price paid. Rooms were so clean and cleaned everyday with fresh towels. The maid even made animals out of our face towels!!! Shower gel was even in the shower!!! and they spray the rooms so you don't get any kind of yuk insects or cockroaches all the time. Food variety was good and we regularly ate in the buffet which surpirsed me as I am more a resturant person. We did try all 3 resturants and they were gorgeous. My favourite was the italian as the pizza was unreal. You can also get similar pizza at the pool snack bar but they are nicer in the resturant. I also loved the ice cream and hot chocolate sauce at the buffet yum yum. Loads of activities from yoga and dance classes in the morning to water areobics to darts, volley ball, step aerobics and lots more all included also. extra for para gliding, snorkling and day trips but not expensive considering you don't put your hand in your pocket for anything else. Evening entertainment is also brillant. They really go to huge effort and even use trapeze in the shows!!!! during the day they will show you how to use the trapeze. it's so cool. Beach is amazing with white sand and clear water. Loads of shade available there which I would recommend as it gets very hot. pool is a bit small but i would rather the beach anyway. pool does have a swim up bar and stools which makes up for the size. I'd recommend a lemon daiquiri to cool you down. All in all I have no complaints about this resort. It mightn't be 5 star luxury that people on a honeymoon might expect but then you aren't paying a 5 star price.

We are a youngish couple/30-40. Came just on our own, our 4th trip to Mexico and 3rd to Mayan Riviera. I will keep it pretty short, but there is so much to say, we are an easy to please Canadian couple who likes to do activities and enjoy the region. We travelled with Sunwing and THAT is another tale:) Rooms: our room was way way way by the front road sign. Great for being quiet, right at the adult pool and gym if that is your thing. I have slight mobility issues, it was a problem for me as it is easily a 10 min walk to the beach. Half that just to the resturaunt. Room is clean and fine, we had a few little glitches - air condition started leaking (was fixed within an hour of us finding a huge puddle). The room has NO water supplied (bottles or otehrwise) which was the worst inconvenience as the resturaunt is so far away and only open certain hours. We complained but no help. There is an EMPTY and HOT minibar in our room:)) The room was cleaned daily, the tv and phone worked fine. The safe you make your own digital combination so that was awesome, no charge. Everything marble and lovely. Grounds: gorgeous and lush if you like nature this is the hotel for you. There are animals on the grounds so if you do not like them, look elsewhere. Tons of vegetation and lots of palapas even on walkways. Great courtyard! TONS of staff always cleaning and smiling pretty much all spoke english except maids, which is normal. Visitors: mainly Italian, USA, German and Canadian, Some topless, not most. Many do not tip which was kind of sad, we really only saw about 5 others tip while we were there. Mostly middle agers, children were mainly 7 and under and the kids program was underway. Food: buffet is really good, lots of selection. No pepper on the tables, just salt. A la carte ( we ate Mexican and Ital) were AWESOME AWESOME. Snack bar ok, always something to eat. Drinks, are good, some are watery but not alot of them. Fast good service. Shop: the shop is very expensive don't shop there unless you don't care of you absolutely have to. Plaza Playacar is right across the street and prices are about half, or a third in town. Front desk: Ok, not fantastic. Internet: seems to always be open, there are two hotspots and also an internet room for 250 pesos for 25 mins - computers work great. Beach is GORGEOUS lots of chairs, very rough ocean not for small kids, drunks or elderly:) Very body surfable. Lots of activities, the cleanest clearest water and sand you could ever want, you CANNOT snorkel here, there is nothing in the water and the waves are big enough to curl. There is a lifeguard. Shows were fun, we have seen better but they also involved children which was cute. Check in and out were very easy. Tours - we always book ours in advance, and they all worked great. There are mutiple tours from the hotel. Some tours pickup across the street at the Plaza, if you do not like to transfer, keep that in mind. Plaza Playacar is a small secure community so they often use one bus to get every one out, and then you transfer to other busses for the region you are traveling to. You cannot want to get a collectivo its all the way into Playa/ 7 dollar cab fare very fast:) Disco was non existent, we tried to get people in there it is nice but people were not into it.

Rooms - Travelling from the UK with young children we were sold \"Superior\" rooms by our UK based Travel company. The rooms are far from Superior, \"Standard\" is more like it. 2 drawers for a family of 4 to share and 8 coat hangers! we lived out of the suit cases for 2 weeks. The bathrooms are basic with a useless shower and grotty shower curtain. Our bath was badly chipped and discoloured, not something you would want to sit in. The balcony was tiny and not somewhere you could relax and enjoy. No fridge or mini bar. Beds, these were fine and we slept well. Maid service - Very good, no complaints. Restaurant - more like a canteen, its very noisy. The food is ok, a bit repetitive but on the whole not bad. Sharing the big bowl of butter in the morning is very poor though, yuk. Make sure you book the other restaurants on offer, these are very good. Food, service and setting are excellent. Don't leave bowls of fruit on your table while you aren't there as the birds will fly in and help themselves, the waiters will laugh but not tell you. Pool food - Was good, plenty of fruit and a fantastic pizza oven. Pool toilet - Not very nice, shoes on people! Wine - Awful Grounds - These are nice and well kept. Pool bar - Fantastic. Venancio is the man you want serving you, always smiling. Never had a problem making our children chocolate milkshakes and always had time to chat even when it was obviously busy. Bars - you will get tired of drinking from plastic cups in the evening, but its understandable when the entertainment is near the pool. Lobby bar is the place to go for a relaxed drink in a glass, the coffee is pretty good too. Did we get ill? yes. What was the cause? not sure. Pool - nice and warm and our kids loved it. Tiled floor around it is lethal, so be careful. All the sunbeds with shade are taken by 6am! even though there are signs saying do not reserve, the hotel do not enforce this. Beach - You couldn't want for more, its lovely. Loads of sport to try, paid $90 for tandem parasailing which was fun. The beach is situated only a few steps from the pool area. All the sunbeds with shade are taken by 5am! We were told by staff that people were reserving beds on the beach as early as 3am, a bit sad really. Entertainment - These guys work their socks off, join in as much or as little as you like, our children loved the evening shows. Front desk - Hopeless to be honest, had a rough time with them telling us that our tour operator had not paid for our stay and so they would need our credit card details! There was never any problem at all, just complete incompetence from the hotel staff. Gave us a rather worrying 24 hours at the start of our holiday. On reporting this to our rep, she asked the hotel to make it up to us, nothing not even an apology. We had a couple of other times where the front desk and guest service were just poor beyond reason, nothing important just frustrating. I'm sure the manager will be along any moment to add comments of reasurance, but they were not interested when we were there. Be warned the hotel runs a members club which is basically another term for time share, they will be your best friend in order to get you to the meeting, as soon as you refuse or cancel you become invisible. We agreed to go just to stop the conversation, waited until they had left for the day and cancelled it. Oh, they do try and get you there with a gift though!! Tipping - yes, do it. Playa del carmen - $7 by taxi, good bargains and good fun. Take the ferry to Cozumel, nice day out. If you are traveling from the UK you will be advised not to take Dollars, this is bad advice. Take dollars and Pesos. Depending who you travel with (excludes BA) its going to cost you \u00a338 departure tax at the airport payable in Pounds or Pesos, not Dollars or cards. All in all we did have a good holiday, kids had a great time. We aren't particularly fussy people and this is the first time I have written a review, but we use this site to try and get honest feedback when booking our annual holiday.

THE BEACH: It is gorgeous, with soft white sand, no shells or rocks to have to walk over. Perfect. There is also free snorkeling equipment, bodyboards to borrow plus and hobie cat rides to be had! THE LOCATION: Great. Safe and guarded resort inside a guarded community. Small Mall across the road (including a Starbucks) and paths that offered easy access to Playa Del Carmen. We borrowed bikes on two mornings and cycled the lovely (and flat) 20mins into town. THE ROOMS: Basic but clean. Bathroom was very nice and a good size. The air conditioning worked well and then beds were comfy. You get one bottle of water a day so be sure to use that for teeth brushing etc as the water at most of the bars is not the best (we bought extra water when out or from the gift shop) \u2013 However the water in the buffet is much better tasting. THE SERVICE: Great. Friendly and efficient. CAR HIRE: If you need to book a rental car you can do so at the hotel but we would recommend either getting once from just inside Playa Del Carmen or getting a quote from another cheaper rental office and asking the \u2018Fiesta Rental\u2019 rep at the hotel to match it (we did that and got a car for 24hours (10% liability to pay in case of accident) for around $50 \u2013 he originally quoted us $65) ACTIVITIES: There is lots going on during the day like dance lessons by the pool and volleyball, soccer & bocci on the beach. POOLS \u2013 There are two. One for everyone, located right by the beach (we didn\u2019t use this one as we swam in the sea) and one adult only relaxation pool at the back of the hotel. We ended most days back there from about 5pm \u2013 6.30pm with a drink or two, and a lounge about in the pool or Jacuzzi. (that bar closes at 6pm) FOOD AND DRINK: It\u2019s a buffet for after a few days it gets a wee bit repetitive but that is to be expected. We did find a lot of things to choose from, normally eating a lot of salads and fresh fruit with our meal, and the Omelet station at breakfast and the pasta station at dinner were great. We were staying 6 nights so we got to book two a la carte meals. We chose the Mexican restaurant for our second night and the Mediterranean restaurant for our last (both at Viva Wyndham) Both were wonderful, and proved to be a welcomed change from the buffet. Plus we highly recommend you try barbecued bananas with ice-cream for dessert at the Mexican resultant. FANTASTIC! The cocktails were good (though maybe ask for some without sugar as they are quite sweet) the beer was nice. There was good coffee served at all the bars except the relaxation pool bar and the wine was\u2026.well not the best but that\u2019s okay. OVERALL: It was a great stay for a fantastic price. The only one fault we had was the noise from the show (mostly from the next hotel over) was very loud and didn\u2019t end until around 1130pm so if you have kids, of are exhausted adults like us after a long day on the beach and in the sea, it was hard to sleep. I would say out block (the 1000 block) was the most impacted. However if you are adults you could wear earplugs and be fine as that really was our only fault with the place. That and the food was a little boring\u2026but that is to be expected with a buffet. But otherwise if you get a good price and you just want beautiful and uncrowded white beaches with clear blue sea, then this hotel is perfect. We looked at several hotels before choosing this one (many 4 and 5 star) but in the end we chose basic rooms and perfect beach, over perfect rooms and an rocky/Shelly/seaweed beach.

The beach: It is gorgeous, with soft white sand, and you can walk along the beach right into Playa Del Carmen. No shells or anything interesting to find, but always people walking around to watch The location: Pretty good - you can walk right into town in about 20 minutes from the hotel. Far from any katamaran trips and the airport - about an hour drive from Cancun. The rooms: Yuck! The floors are sticky and gritty at all times. The air conditioning worked well though. The sheets they put on aren't actually big enough for the beds so be prepared to wake up on bare mattress that thousands have slept on before you. The beds are TERRIBLE!!! They are a thin mattress on a concrete pad. I have been to Mexico twice before, no other place compared in the poor quality of the beds. The rooms are plain, and a little depressing with their flourscent lighting The service: Dismal. At one point our mag-key lock on door stopped working. The front desk told us to call \"0\" and figure it out. Great, we were already locked out, thanks for the help. We also had asked the front desk & concierge about other things to see in Mexico that weren't on their excursion list. They told us, if we don't provide it, we know nothing. Awesome. Also, one of our towels was taken by a group of tourists - we went to the desk to get another towel and they said there was nothing they could do. So, we spent part of the week without a frickin' towel. The service here was so bad, we were very angry when we left. The action: The pool bar is the place to be at this hotel - they usually have salsa lessons or \"crazy\" games ( pretty tame ) by the pool, so that is where the drinkers are which usually means noise and music. There is volleyball, soccer & bocci on the beach. If you are very young, you would find this place fun I think. Food & drink: No champagne at any bar unlike other resorts. The mixed drinks are pretty good, and they were good to my kids who insisted on drinking the sweet concoctions at every turn. The buffet is poor. We all lived on cereal and eggs. Long lineups for eggs and omelets which is frustrating in the morning. There is always ice cream at night though! The snack bar was good, if it didn't run out of food, which happened often. Pizza, sometimes hot wings and hamburgers were available if they hadn't run out yet. Oh, and if you ask for a glass of milk for your kids, it's served warm. If you ask for \"leche frio\" they throw an ice cube in it. Gross. We went to an incredible a la carte meal, but it was at another hotel which would have been nice if they told us when we booked it - we almost missed out. Overall, if you get a cheap, cheap deal, go here. If you are young and want to party, you will like it.

My experiences may have been different during peak season. Dining: Getting reservations for the ala cart dinners is a bit of a joke (seeing how the restaurants were near empty), yet it was the same at the Riu a couple days later. They want you to use the buffet and don't make it easy. Just show up when you want to dine and tip the Ma\u00eetre de. You may have to wait half an hour, but you should get in. And please tip the waiters too. The food in the Italian restaurant was exceptional. The others were very good. The service was great. Beach chairs: yeh, yeh, people come out early and claim the chairs. Very rude behavior, because if they just sat in the chairs when they needed them, there would be enough to go around. The trick we found was to become a VIP member and not fight for chairs. Sign up in advance to their rewards program. Even better, the chairs are padded too:-) Rooms: 70's modern, but very comfortable. Balcony small, but great for drying swimsuits or wetsuits. Beds comfy and service great. We did get 2 or 3 new waters daily, not one for the entire time. Buffet: Better than the Riu (Although the Riu had better atmosphere). Good choices. Only complaint is the Avacado sauce is only fair. Drinks: White wine was watered down some of the time (from ice to keep it cold, I think). Red was fine. Beer always good but the only choice is Dos XX. Mediocre margaritas, not bad, but just fair. Room for improvement here. Water at the bar and buffet was sometimes good and others tasted like tap water. Beach: Awesome beach!!! The chairs are close to shore, there is more shade areas then most other beach resorts. Nothing to see snorkeling. Go to Puerto Moreles or Dos Ojos on a snorkle trip if that is what you want.

First the Resort- It is beautiful and well kept. The staff is professional and willing to accommodate if possible. Jessica at the front desk was a wonderful help and a super sweet lady. The best bartender is Vilencio...makes excellent Mojitos and ALWAYS with a big wonderful smile. The maids are very willing to get you what you need. No many of them DO NOT speak english...but really how many maids in America speak a second language?? We are visiting THEIR country, so deal with it. The entertainmant and shows are great, the comedy and disney shows were our favorites. Some of the dancing shows were a little boring to us but to each their own. The drinks were mixed just fine not watered down as I had read on here. One thing we really liked was that there was a bloody mary bar at breakfast where we could make our own. The pool was tyically keep clean daily. The ocean was unbelieveably beautiful! One word of warning....If the flag is RED enter the water at your own risk, the waves can be killers! the buffet food is average and yes it does get old after while, we were a little disappointed there was not more seafood offered. The rooms were cleaned very well daily, we would go to breakfast and come back to a clean room. Only 1 day out of seven was it cleaned in the afternoon. The one down side is that they are not real good at restocking the mini fridge. Everyday we called to the front desk to get a restock. our beds were NOT hard at all, very comfy. The court yard, patio area and covered walkways are gorgeous. We had massages fro Mothers day and they were WONDERFUL!!! I think anyone booking here needs to remember this is NOT America or Europe...it's MEXICO...NOT a 1st world country so do not expect first world rating...keep it in perspective. These people work very hard to entertain and accommodate YOU. Now for Playa del Carmen and outside activities... Playa is beautiful and safe...day or night so please explore this wonderful area! We took the ferry over to Cozumel and rented a jeep to drive around the island with. What a fantastic experience. I would recommend stopping at Rasta's Beach Bar...AWESOME! The National parks right on the coast are amazing with huge crashing waves on the rock...you don't want to miss that! Coconuts is a fun bar to stop at also...it's on a cliff so you can see a lot of the shoreline from an elevated view. the one guided excursion we took was to see the Mayan ruins at Tulum. We booked with grayline and the one thing that we were told was that we got to swim in an underground river...well NOT exactly...it was a pond. We still had great fun and got to jump off cliffs into the water if we wanted. The one real complaint we had is we were not warned of the excessive walking involved. I would say we walked a good 5 miles between the ruins, jeep ride through the jungle,zipline, lunch, swimming and back to the bus. All this in 90 degree weather,so be prepared. All in all we enjoyed the vacation very much. We hope you find this helpful in your travels and REMEMBER YOUR vacation is what YOU make it!!

It started a year ago when we saw a wedding on that Viva Maya beach and we decided to bring our family from France and do the same. A year later, here we are! The reservation staff helped us book rooms for our 40 non-English-Speaking guests and Marco Castillo (the hotel wedding planner) took care of the rest! We were greeted like VIP and had a special area on the beach and at the buffet for our group to be together. The day following our arrival, we had a 2-hour-meeting with Marco to choose our wedding options (music, food, decor, flowers,...). Then I (the bride) had a hair trial at the spa. Those ladies are amazing! They're very talented and make this experience easy for the bride! Two days before the wedding we had a rehearsal on the beach, we met with the photographer and the rest happened by itself. At 3pm the photographer came to our rooms to shoot the groom and bride getting ready. Then the ceremony started at 4pm on the beach. We had a guitarist play our songs and the mariachis afterwards with hors-d'oeuvres and champagne. After taking photos on the beach and in the gardens, we headed to the beautiful Miramar restaurant where we had our reception. We had the Marimba playing at the beginning of the dinner and then a DJ who agreed to let us have videos, speeches, dances and games. At midnight we headed to the dicotheque to end the evening. It was an unforgettable experience and the whole staff (most of all Marco who was running everywhere!) was adorable. For any bride and groom, this is the best option! A wedding planner takes care of the organization and the beautiful beach makes your pictures perfect! Because this is also very affordable, we were able to privatize a catamaran and take our guests snorkeling. Paradise Catamarans had decored the boat with wedding linens and flowers! We even had a wedding cake on board and were able to dance... What an amazing crew! This was a dream for our guests and ourselves!

We are experienced travellers & have stayed at fancier places but not with service like that. It doesn't have all the bells & whistles but it was unbelievable value. We have never seen so much staff trying to make your stay pleasurable. They are constantly trying to improve on any complaints too! Our room was spotless with fantastic pool & ocean view. The employees don't look for tips & still provide good service but appreciate them when & if you do. There are so many activities to do if you want to join in & particularly great for families. We have two teenage boys who had lots to choose from. We are beach people & the beach was spectacular. There is always a breeze to help cool you but sometimes too windy. The water is turquoise & clean with white sand. If you are pool people,the main pool isn't too big but still enjoyed by all close to the beach. There is also a quiet adult pool away from everything with it's own bar if you prefer. They have the resort well balanced with different areas to enjoy like the courtyard to relax in as well. There are also the lobby & pool bar areas. Everything is well set up & very user friendly. The dining hours are good & nice a la carte restaurants. The lunch buffet by the pool bar is very convenient with lots of variety. It was also high season but still found the line ups or waits weren't too long. The resort is also located in the gated community of Playacar with lots of security & you can walk safely to Playa Del Carmen by the beach or road which was an added bonus. We also used the resort bicycles to ride there which we really enjoyed & also gave us locks. The food is plentiful, good & enough variety to choose from but just not gourmet if that's what you want. The resort is also a great size, not too big or small with not too much walking within it to get to different areas. We let our teenagers off on their own & just met up with them. They also keep the grounds nice & are always working on them. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask! In our opinion collectively, from a family of four you can't go wrong with this resort for a fun family holiday!", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "alsmedic", "Title": "\u201cExactly what we wanted, all inclusive on a budget, looks like the pictures!\u201d", "Author": "alsmedic", "ReviewID": "UR106220081", "Content": "This was our first time at an all inclusive resort. My wife and I booked our trip on bookit.com. We found great rates and set up roundtrip transportation using BESTDAY travel on the site. The ride to the hotel was about 1hr 15min dropping off other vacationers at their resorts. The resort is located in Playa Car which is a private secure/gated community and was beautiful to bike and walk around. On arrival check-in went smoothly with an orientation to the room by the Bell boy. I'd recommend before going to your room immediately turning around from the check in desk and booking Al a carte dinner's with the concierge desk. These of course are included 2 dinners for 5 nights,3 for 7 etc. They seem to fill quickly and if your going to do any tipping this is probably the guy to give a little extra money to. He has the power to get you a dinner seat at 6pm or 10pm. The earlier is probably better... The room: We stayed in 1220 which looks into the center of the resort, right at the main events stage. I would highly recommend interior resort rooms (Garden View) as the outward looking rooms just look at other resorts walls and have zero scenic overlooks from the balcony. The room was clean, no bugs as one poster had reported previously. An occasional mosquito looking bug flew in if we opened the balcony door but they were harmless. Air-conditioning was decent but typically could only cool to 22-23c which was substantial considering the outside temperature. Huge glass shower in the bathroom. Other posters had complained about hallway noise. This was noticeable. Specifically in the morning as people left to breakfast. The Food: The main dinning room was nice. Nothing fancy but my wife who is extremely picky at her food choices was always able to find something to eat. Breakfast and Lunch may be the best meals for us. Plenty of seafood was on the buffet through out the week. Again I agree with other posts that if the stay was going to be over a week that the buffet would become old. Pasta bar and Omelet station were always safe choices. You might want to avoid the house wines, not the best but something to go with dinner The Snack Bar: hours from 11am-6pm and 11pm-6am we only went during the day time but pizza, burgers, chips salsa, soup, fruit were always present. Most people just had lunch here since it was so close to the beach and activities. The Beach: Beautiful, reserve your chair early despite what the signs request. If you are out after 9 am you will not find a seat in the shade but every couple of hours we noticed shaded chairs opening up. The swimming area is nice and well kept. The pools: There are two pools the main one located central to the resort near the beach which gets busy but is great for families and activities and the Relax pool which is located towards the front of the resort. Towards the end of our stay we ended up at the relax pool. It was quite and had a Bar on site. Typically only adults were here and it made it a nice place to get some sun and read when not on the beach. The alcohol: The beer is probably the only drink with a consistent level of alcohol and it's dos equis or sol. They are beers for the hot summer so if your going to get your drink on it may take a few to get your buzz. The mixed drinks were decent but full of sugar and contained little actual alcohol. I actually found this ok since people weren't walking around the resort drunk and I didn't have to worry about dehydration or a hangover. Tequilla shots are available at all the bars so if you want alcohol that might be the way to go. All in all the drinks were great and they would mix anything you wanted, just understand that the sky bottle behind the bar probably doesn't have sky in it. My favorite drink ended up being the frozen lemonade. Hobbie catamarans , boogie boards, and many other activities are available and included in your stay. This is a very family oriented resort. Overall I'd return to this resort. The staff was friendly the rooms and services were great. This is very family friendly and at a price point many can afford.", "Date": "April 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cWe loved the Viva Wyndham Maya\u201d", "Author": "EriW", "ReviewID": "UR106192972", "Content": "Let me start by saying that every review you\u2019ll find about the Viva Wyndham Maya is useful and correct, both positive and negative. It all depends on your expectations. Do you want a super luxurious 5* all inclusive hotel? Then you should not go to the Viva Wyndham Maya. The room are spacious, clean and comfortable, but nothing fancy. Our housekeeper Jorge surprised us every day with animals he made from the towels, and doubt it you\u2019ll find that in a big 5* hotel. Ask for a room in the 1000-1399 or 2000-2399 range. They are close to the pool and the beach. Are you looking for more quiet rooms; ask for a room next to the adult pool (3000 range). In any case the Viva Wyndham Maya is not a very big hotel, and it took us less than 5 minutes to walk from our room \u2013 which was located right next to the beach and furthest from the restaurant \u2013 to walk to the bar and restaurant. Are you looking for haute cuisine? Then you probably won\u2019t like the restaurants at the Viva Wyndham Maya. But you will get a wide variety of fine food. Enough choice to eat something different each day, at least during the two weeks we stayed at the Viva Wyndham Maya. And when you visit other countries, you will always find food you\u2019re not used to or do not like. The sports and animation team made sure there was always loads of activities to choose from. They were all very nice and capable people. It\u2019s a shame that during the two weeks we stayed at Viva Wyndham Maya no less than 5 people left the team, and other people we spoke to told us they were considering other plans. The team lead was not very friendly towards the guests, and I think he should be an example for his team. We really enjoyed watching Israel and Isabel dance, especially the shows \u2018Twilight\u2019 and \u2018Las Vegas\u2019. And Hector is a talented piano player! The Viva Wyndham Maya is a nice place to visit with kids. We don\u2019t have kids ourselves, but we hardly noticed there were so much kids around. There is so much they can do. There were two things we didn\u2019t like: if you wanted to have a sunbed on the beach or at the pool, you should get up at 5 o\u2019clock. It is not allowed to reserve the beds with a towel, but everybody does it. After a few days we also left our towels on the beds before breakfast, because otherwise they were all taken. The second thing we didn\u2019t like was that everybody took the food from the snack bar to the beach. After finishing a lot of them left their dirty plates next to the garbage bins, so a lot of birds gathered around to pick the left overs. I think it would benefit everybody if the Viva Wyndham Maya management would be a bit more strict about these things. Overall we were very happy with our choice to spend two weeks at the Viva Wyndham Maya. All staff was really nice, although we think that receptionists should be friendlier and more service minded then the people that are working at the reception of the Viva Wyndham Maya. Still doubting whether to go to the Viva Wyndham Maya or the Viva Wyndham Azteca? We decided to go to the Viva Wyndham Maya, because it\u2019s a bit bigger, more activities and services and more people. We were told that people who complain about the noise \u2013 which is actually not necessary, we hardly heard anything \u2013 are send to the Viva Wyndham Azteca. Also the beach at the Viva Wyndham Maya is better. But for people who want to relax the Viva Wyndham Azteca is a great alternative. Things to see when you are in Yucatan: - Playa del Carmen 5a avenida is packed with souvenir shops, tour operators offering excursions and busy restaurants. Leave this area and you\u2019ll find some hidden secrets. Ask the staff of the hotel if they know a nice place to eat outside the tourist area and they will send you to the best places to eat at very reasonable prices. Souvenirs are also cheaper there. - Cozumel is great for snorkeling. We rented a \u2018Mexican Ferrari\u2019 and started driving. Our idea was to drive around the island, but we liked the beaches (and the food) at the Money Bar, so we decided to stay there. - Tulum is beautiful, but go there very early! Around 11 o\u2019clock the place is very busy, I guess until it closes. - Xel-Ha is especially nice for people with kids, but we regretted we didn\u2019t go to Xplore instead. Snorkeling at Cozumel was much better than at Xel-Ha and all the other activities we just ok. (Want to know more: read my review about Xel-Ha) - Cancun is a must see, but nothing special. A lot of hotels, but no possibility to visit the beaches. Avoid taxis, you can easily get around the city by bus, saving a lot of money. - We didn\u2019t go to Chitzen Itza, because we didn\u2019t want to spend more time in a tourbus, than at the ruins. If we return to Yucatan another year, we will rent a car and spend the night close to Chitzen Itza and go there early in the morning. There\u2019s a lot more to see and do, but we liked the Viva Wyndham Maya so much, that we didn\u2019t feel like going out more.

In our group, my husband and I (early 30's), sister & friend (late 20's) and our parents. I was worried because I selected the resort and this is most of my family's only 2nd all inclusive experience and we stayed in a fancy 5 star resort last year for my wedding. But luckily, my entire group thought the resort was amazing and could not stop raving about how much they liked this resort based on price, vs. the resort we stayed in the DR last year. The layout is great, on the smaller side, but enough of a walk to places to burn off those calories! We were in the furthest building (rm 3316) which is near the 'relax pool' and tennis courts (only downfall is the first night, the people using the tennis courts early in the morning woke me up! otherwise I didn't even notice it the rest of the week). Rooms are pretty basic, but better than I expected based on reading other reviews. We got 2 queen beds, which didn't bother us too much, we used one of the beds to lay out our clothes and things. Rooms were very clean, had a small fridge and nice flat screen tv. Beds were a little harder than I'm used to, but my parents actually preferred that! The bedding was changed halfway through the week and the 2nd set was much softer than the first, that is one area that could be upgraded, softer sheets! :) You do have to get your own water, but it's very well priced (cheaper than Canada!) or we brought water containers and just filled them up before bed. The beach at this resort is phenomenal! The water is gorgeous. Unfortunately disrespectful guests litter their cigarette butts all over and although the staff try to clean and keep people from doing this, it is a bit of a problem. We walked along the beach towards the city and noticed that the sand got more and more pebbly as you walked, but the sand a VWM is powdery white. They also added another row of palapas the week we were there, so it's easier to find shade now! We rarely had a problem finding a free seat. Although, I was disgusted to over hear a man say that he had found extra towel cards in his room and decided to put towels on seats at the beach and each of the pools, RUDE! The resort staff are truly the best part of this resort. The entertainment staff in particular made our trip amazing. The shows are hilarious and well done. I loved the Vegas show & comedy show the best. We participated in many daily activities and had a blast. There is also a trapeze and area to paint ceramics which we didn't get a chance to utilize. Bar staff were great too, they always remember your drink and usually keep sending them over when they see you're getting low (if you tip well that is!). My husband and I are also avid gym goers and were worried because there was no mention of a gym on the website. We were elated to discover that there was a very well equipped gym and Lester, who runs the gym will even help you train if you like! We used it about 5 times during our stay, probably one of the better resort gyms I have seen. We all thought the food was fantastic! I am pretty picky with what I can and can't eat. I was very happy to see the yogourt and mixed seeds/nuts at the breakfast buffet - even flaxseeds! Any resort buffet gets tired after 7 days, but they try to switch it up every evening. The a la carte's were really good as well. We each had a favourite, mine was the medditteranean, but the Italian and Mexican were great as well. Book them when you first arrive! We did a day trip which we booked through Juan on the beach, half the price as Sunwing and much more included! We did, Tulum, Paradise Beach, Coba and a stunning Cenote all in one day for $65 (lunch incl)! Our tour guide, Benjamin, was very knowledgeable and gave us a great history lesson. We all loved that the resort was in the gated area of Playacar, very safe and you're able to walk around and visit all of the shoppes and a Starbucks if you need! There is no bartering (or very minimal) at these shoppes, or even many of the bigger shoppes in 5th Ave. They will tell you straight up, no, if you even try. But the small stands, you should barter to about 50% of what they first try to sell it to you for. The disco was actually pretty good too. A bit of a younger crowd most nights, but better later in the night. One night they closed early and we made them turn the lights back out and start up the music again. The crowd was mostly European and French Canadians...most people speaking French or German and lots of topless sunbathers and itsy speedos! If you can get past that and the attitude that comes with it, you'll be fine. U.S. dollars are still widely accepted, but difficult to get from the money exchange. Canadian dollars are also accepted more now since it's worth more than the US right now. Pesos are of course the preferred curency and for the most part, you get the best value if you pay with pesos because they usually par it with dollars - ie. $7 is 70 pesos, but if you actually calculate 70 peses, it's more than $7. Overall, especially for the deal we got, we were VERY pleased with this resort. One thing they could fix was that most of our balcony doors didn't lock, that could be a problem if you're on the ground floor.

This was our first time at an A.I. and, except for some information from experienced friends and family we did not really know what to expect. We are both pretty casual people who were wanting a fun, relaxed holiday in the sun while sticking within a budget which is very easy to do when going A.I. We did tip - daily to our room attendant (who managed to leave a different towel animal on our bed every day for 14 days) and per drink with bar staff as well as in the a la carte restaurants. We read about difficulty getting reservations for restaurants but we had not trouble at all, even changing reservations - there was always a staff member when we needed them and they were always helpful. We were quite surprised to see few other guests tipping - as if because the drinks were free there was no tip necessary. I sure hope these guests went around and tipped the bartenders at the end of their visit. The buffet restaurant was just fine. Pretty pedestrian food but you could always find something you enjoyed. The a la carte restaurants (particularly Portofino) were great. I must say that, I agree that the drinks appear to be diluted as you can drink several in an evening and feel no effect whatsoever. Though, perhaps not such a bad thing. Also, the house wine was very disappointing. Mind you, we found some good, relatively inexpensive wine on the menu at the restaurants. As far as the beach is concerned - lots of cigarette butts, wonder how that could be avoided other than people picking them up one by one each night I am not sure. Also (and most important) hard to find an available lounge chair that was in decent repair - there is a lot of maintenance and replacement to be done (broken plastic parts and sagging seats) as I do believe this really lets the hotel down Staff everywhere in the resort is wonderful, no matter what job they are performing - they are friendly, helpful, outgoing and fun. The entertainment staff were a busy group - working all day playing games with the guests and their children (I am going to miss hearing \"Crazy game\" bellowed up and down the beach) then at night time the same group were performing in the nightly shows. Lip-sink, granted but high energy and talented dancers. We would have liked to see more of the latin dancing in the shows - you know Chakira, Gloria Estefan, Ricky Martin songs - something to really get the crowd off their feet. I just know this energetic group of kids are equal to the challenge.

That being said this resort failed to impress me overall but I did like some portions of it and I will start with those. I just returned from a week at the Viva with another couple. We stayed on the 3rd floor of the 3000 building with a nice view of the quiet pool. Excellent/Good - The Animation Team was top notch. They were very friendly and funny. We enjoyed them all week and participated in a lot of their activities. They also do a great job in the nightly shows which are enjoyable. - The grounds of the resort are spotless, well maintained and beautiful. I loved that they had some native animals and lizards roaming the grounds that were harmless and fun to photograph. Also putting up sign that describe the animals and flora was a nice touch. They also had a nice \"jungle\" area in the middle that made for some nice photos and allowed you to catch the animals in their \"natural\" environment. - The beach was outstanding. It was clean and the sand was well maintained. It was a much better experience then we had the previous year at the Gran Porto. I also had a great time body surfing in the waves. - The staff at the bar, the ala carte restaurants as well as the cleaning crews throughout the resort was all hard working, quick and courteous. - The layout and size of the resort was nice and seemed to be just the right size. It was never more than a 5 minute walk to any part of the resort. Just as an FYI it has sufficient handicap access as there was a woman there in a wheelchair that appeared to have no trouble getting around as I saw her in multiple areas. - The Playacar area is beautiful and offers a nice backdrop for an early morning or evening walk or run. You feel extremely safe and the traffic is pretty much limited to taxis and other pedestrians. There is also a small shopping area there but the prices were a little higher than 5th Ave. - The quiet pool next to our building was very nice. We went there at the end of each afternoon to have a drink and just relax in the pool. The bartender there was excellent and remembered what we drank each day. -The snack bar at the pool was very good. We ate there every day. I actually enjoyed the food there more than any of the other places we ate at the resort. Try the brick oven pizza there you won\u2019t be let down. Average - The food at the ala carte was pretty average. We did the Don Diego at the Wyndham and Bamboo at the Azteca. Both restaurants were nice inside and the staff as very attentive but the small portions, limited menu and the difficulty getting reservations, which I will cover below, made the experience only average. - Our room was a good size and had a nice view of the pool. We were in Rm 3319. It was sort of dated and had a very small patio which didn't really allow us to sit on them. The bed was very hard but it didn't really bother me. We also had a mini fridge which we assumed would be stocked daily with at least bottled water but was not stocked ever. The housecleaning crew did a good job keeping the room clean each day and also made a fun towel animal. The water pressure in the shower was good but getting hot water in the morning could be tricky sometimes. This was our second room after the initial room they gave us was missing both a single bed and minifridge as we requested when we booked. - The food at the breakfast buffet was average. It was repetitive after a few days and the place got crowded overwhelming the staff. If you enjoy a few cups of coffee with breakfast good luck getting refills as the entire staff of the dining room is busy cleaning tables and replacing the food in the buffet. -The main pool was a good size and was never overcrowded even though the hotel was at or near capacity. However the layout of the chairs/palapas was poorly designed and they may have been better served to have small tables with umbrellas that could be moved to suit your needs. There was also a film that tended to form in the pool probably due to sunscreen etc but that is probably unavoidable. Also having a swim up bar and a ledge to sit on inside the pool were nice features. The \u201ctowel game\u201d which I will cover below made the pool less enjoyable than it should have been. Bad -The ala carte reservation system was terrible. You are only allotted a certain number of reservations based upon your length of stay (we received 3 for a week). The problem was actually being able to use the reservations as the restaurants were always \u201cbooked\u201d. I put booked in quotes because with the 2 reservations we were able to get the restaurants were maybe half filled. We talked to a lot of people there that weren\u2019t able to get any reservations. On top of that lack of reservations the times we were able to get were at 6pm and 8:45pm which isn\u2019t exactly prime time to eat dinner on vacation. This put us in a spot where we had to eat on 5th Ave on 3 of our 7 nights and pay out of pocket. - The towel game is unavoidable at any resort but the layout of the pool and beach area at the Wyndham made it even worse. The palapas they have are the only way to get any shade but they are limited and fixed so you can\u2019t get both sun and shade. We traveled with another couple and were forced to alternate days of getting up about 5:30 am in order to get a spot next to the pool under a palapa or on the beach under the palapa. By 6 am the spots were limited and by 6:15 pretty much gone. Getting up that early in order to get a seat by the pool or on the beach really took away from our enjoyment. -The wifi was spotty at best and forced you to get a code good for 5 hours from the front desk in order to use it. I wasn\u2019t even aware of this for the first couple days until I finally asked why I couldn\u2019t connect. You then had to go to a \u201chotspot\u201d in order to use it so you couldn\u2019t check your email from your deck or room. Once I was finally connected and went to the lobby area to use the internet I was very disappointed to find out I couldn\u2019t use any app or go to any page they classify as a social networking site. Facebook would have been nice to be able to use but I get a majority of my news and current events from Twitter (esp in a foreign country where a lot of the TV stations are in Spanish) and I was unable to access that as well. In summation this resort like any other resort has its pluses and minuses and you get what you pay for but for a resort classified as a 4 Star resort I expected a bit more. Our decision to stay here was based upon it being a few hundred cheaper than another resort in the area we were interested in but after spending almost $500 a couple to eat on 5th Ave the savings was lost. Like I said in the beginning I am not that picky but I will not be staying here again.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Holiday - Didn't want to come home!\u201d", "Author": "Mooneyes_Calgary", "ReviewID": "UR105212541", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this resort from April 06 \u2013 21 with our daughters, 9 and 14. We were given room 2322 and had a great view of the ocean. The room was clean and we saw one bug in the room over 16 days. We thought this resort was fantastic and accommodated all what we were looking for in an all-inclusive package. This is an excellent resort for children. There were not too many cons with this resort and the minor irritants were things we could deal with and not let it get in the way of our vacation. We also spent half the time outside the resort doing excursions. The Rooms: We found the maid service to be great. We tipped every day at least $3 US and always had 4 new bottles of water, champagne, cerveza\u2019s, pop, juice, and beautiful towel/toilet paper art. For people complaining about not receiving any of this, you need to open your wallets\u2026these people work very hard and $3 dollars a day over 16 days is only $48. Beds were hard and pretty uncomfortable, not many sheets but we didn\u2019t really need more. The lighting in the room was terrible at night and the florescent bulb would flicker for about half an hour after turning it out at night. Also, the walls are white which makes you feel like you are in a hospital\u2026recommendation for the resort would be add some colour to the walls and upgrade the lighting to make it more ambient. We did not have a fridge in our room as we requested until the 11th day of our stay\u2026this was irritating but we were only in our room to sleep and shower. The warm beverages were consumed regardless \uf04a The Service, location, and grounds: All of the staff were courteous and friendly and you were always greeted with a Hola or a Como estas. They went out of there way to include everyone in the entertainment and games\u2026they would walk up and down the beach asking everyone to participate. Bartenders were great, we tipped for most drinks which I might not do as frequently if I return. The grounds are very well taken care of and there is constantly workers doing something or other to improve and maintain it. The location in Playacar is very convenient\u2013 only $7US to get to 5th ave in PDC and $14 to Xplor and Xcaret parks. The Entertainment and Animation Team: The animation team was fantastic. The kids club was amazing and included all the children in the nightly entertainment kids program. Our 9 year old participated in the \u201cDisney Dreams\u201d theme night last Tuesday which was a lot of fun. All of the shows were well put together and very entertaining. There are activities that run all day long ranging from bocce ball to meringue dancing. The nightlife around the resort was fairly quiet which suited us. The disco was not very close to the rooms so your sleep was not interrupted. The courtyard was beautifully lit up at night, which gave it an ambient setting \u2013 a wonderful place to relax after dinner and have a drink or specialty coffee. Beach, Ocean, and Weather: The ocean is bath water warm,\u2026just as warm as the pool\u2026some rocky areas with lots of broken coral but this is expected. The beach was amazing and well taken care of\u2026one of the most beautiful beaches we have seen. The weather was amazing\u2026recommend traveling in April\u2026not a single drop of rain over the entire holiday. The Food: Booking a la cartes was a painful process and the restaurants were never half-full; although this made for great service while dining. Buffet was ok, got a bit boring but it definitely could have been worse\u2026we never went hungry. The snack bar was not that good and the burgers were terrible. There was enough variety that you could change it up each night\u2026and if you couldn\u2019t find something you wanted, there was always great pasta made just the way you like it. We ate at Don Diego\u2019s (Mexican), Mira Mare (Italian), Portofino (Mediterranean), and Il Plato (Italian). The best was the Portofino and Don Diego\u2019s was good too. All in all we had a great time at this resort. We read many reviews before we booked and arrived and had an idea of what to expect regarding rooms and front desk staff \u2013 which I will agree with most, the rooms are very basic and the front desk staff could be friendlier. I would return to this resort for the same price as our expectations were not let down and we had a good time.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cSorry - NOT a fan of this resort!\u201d", "Author": "LA07726", "ReviewID": "UR105099033", "Content": "Just returned from Viva today, w/my husband and my 8yr old son. To sum it up, this place is NOT above average in any way. If you are looking for a budget vacation, this will be okay. If you are looking for any sort of plush comfort whatsoever, don't stay here. It simply is not that type of resort. The grounds are nice. However, the rooms were a huge disappointment as they are utterly devoid of any comfort and incredibly noisy. We had to ask for a room change immediately because the first room stunk of bleach and mold as it was on the shady side of the hotel in the 1200's. The 2nd room was in the 2000's, on the sunnier side (facing the Riu) and an improvement but the design was the same: hard tiled slippery floors, bare white walls, hard beds, thin cotton sheets and pillow, and one awful flourescent lightbulb in ceiling. The lighting was terrible in both rooms so we avoided using them and used natural light when we could. We used the tiny bed lights and the bathroom lights when needed (I'm not kidding). Also, there is little or no storage space. . We had 3 desklike drawers that were basically useless, so we lived out of our suitcases on the floor. One chair. We had no fridge as we were supposed to. We were given 3 bottles of water over a span of 6 days, for 3 people. Honestly, the worst hotel room we've ever had. This was depressing but we were stuck so we made the best of it. The buffet is decent. Highlight at dinner buffet is the pasta station and for breakfast, the omelet station. Desserts were ehh, but we liked the coffee and fresh juice. The pool is too small, and you can forget finding a beachchair by the pool or on the beach under the trees. Unless you get up at 6am, you will be baking in the sun as no umbrellas are sold anywhere. My husband attempted to get us chairs at 7:45am and they were mostly empty but all were covered/reserved with towels. Hotel staff did not enforce the no-reserve rule at all. There is a show at 930pm every night - they are good! We looked forward to these every night as it was the only positive we felt the resort had to offer. The bar staff works hard and there is liquor in the drinks although they are a bit sugary. Dos Equis is offered and is a decent beer so no issue there. 5 minute taxi to Fifth Ave, the heart of Playa, which was enjoyable. Can say without a doubt I'd never go back to this resort and if you are reading this and can afford to spend a bit more, please go elsewhere. Save yourself the aggravation.

After three days, you will get tired of same old buffets. Here are the plus points: 1) The beach entertainment was good. The staff went out of their way to keep the guests entertained. 2) The hotel staff were very friendly and hard working. They attended to your needs. Kept the hotel clean. The beach is awesome, there were enough beach benches for everyone to sit back and relax, enjoy the sun. The hotel is extremely secure. Entering the Playa Del Carmen from the highway, you feel like you are entering a nice community. At the security gate, all drivers have to specify why they are entering the area, usually provide a hotel room # or some sort of authorization. I went to the 5th avenue and came in late, around 1.00am. The hotel checked my badge and compared it with the hotel room I told them. My kids, 11 & 8 roamed around the entire hotel complex carefree, totally enjoyed the all-inclusive plan. The spa services are great and priced cheap enough compared to USA.

Bad move for the 4 of us. First, a selling point is a membership with another program which we found impossible to use as we are Canadians....therefore we can only use the Viva Wyndham Resorts of which there are only 2on the Mayan Riviera, 2 in la Romana, one each in Puerto Plata , Samana and Cabarete and one in the Bahamas. All of these resorts are 3-3.5 star. As members we were surprised that it took us close to 2 months to book our rooms . When my husband called our contact persons and then the resort he was put on hold for very long periods of time , and being passed from one person to another, none of whom could or would confirm room availability or our bookings. This occured several times. When he e-mailed for a booking (which he also did several times) he was told nothing could be done for 72 hours and then he would hear nothing further and have to repeat the process again. It was an unnecessarily long and frustrating process as we cannot book out flights until we have a room and cannot book a room if we don't have a flight.. Then, close to 2 months after he started trying to book our rooms we were told that there were no rooms available. My husband then sent them an e-mail informing them of how long it took to get any reply and that there were rooms available when he began the booking process. We got a call 2 days later saying there were rooms for us for an additional cost. When we asked we were told there was \"always an additional cost to stay in building C (which is supposed to be the members building) but no guests were ever charged.\" These were the same rooms we had stayed in on our 2 previous visits. No-one else that we spoke to had to pay extra for a king-size bed or to stay in the \"members building.\" My husband should not have had to spend so much time jumping through hoops and then have to pay extra to book a room when we are members of the \"Viva Club.\" The only extras one gets as a Club member is an accelerated check in, special seating area in the buffet , a roped off area on the beach with nicer beach chairs, a special members dinner which is not so great. and hardly anyone goes to and a plate of fruit and a bottle of wine in our room on arrival. We have stayed at the Viva Maya 3 times now, 2 weeks at a time. Sad to say that the quality has really deteriorated since the first time we stayed there. The air conditioning did not work in first room we had and we were unable to sleep as we were very hot...our friends room was worse than ours and the temperature in there room was a steady 27 degrees. We complained daily and for 4 days someone was sent to \"fix\" our airconditioners. Then we were offered another room. Our friends room was ok but the airconditioner in our room never shut off and our room stayed at 17.5 degrees 24/7. We would wake up shaking and shivering and one of us would have to get up and turn the air conditioner off. Then get back up to turn it on when it got too hot....we would be up and down all night turning the air conditioner on or off. When it is off the floor would sweat and become wet increasing the risk to slip and fall. We complained about this on a daily basis and although someone was sent to \"fix\" it daily it was never done. After 7 days of this we were offered a new room. We refused as we had already gone through the unpacking and packing process to go from one problematic room to another and we did not want to do it a third time. So...all of this resulted in 2 weeks of very poor sleep. We were \"just a bit\" cranky and tired for the whole 2 weeks we were there. Now, the food quality has gone way down from prior visits...\"butter\" (definately not butter..tasted more like lard) was put in a big bowl with a \"community \" knife to get it out. This knife was found at the bottom of the bowl more often than not...very unsanitary with so many hands touching it. The bacon is hidden where the eggs are fried and you must get in line for up to 10-15 minuites to get a couple of pieces. It ran out 11/2 hours before breakfast was done a couple of times and no more was made. The snack bar did not have the variety it had before and not enough food for the number of people using it. The snack bar was often out of french fries... They also served turkey weinners which were just terrible. The pizzas were nowhere near as good as they used to be in years past. Although there ia a big decline in the food quality we were usually able to find something to eat. Must add that all four of us got sick at various times which has never happened before. The chef at the snack bar was often found out where the food was being served watching and questioning people about how much food they were taking and why. It was a very uncomfortable feeling being questioned as we would sometimes get food for ourselves and our spouses at the same time. The adults only pool was in poor condition...grating around the pool was broken in several areas and lifted up in others. People were at a significnt risk of tripping, cutting themselves or going through the grating and breaking some bones. The pool itself had missing and broken tiles. some of the jets were not working at times. The lawn chairs were mouldy and needed to be replaced. The relax bar and service was excellent. The main pool and beach was where most of the activity was. The main pool (we have never gone in it) is much too small for the number of guests...not everyone likes salt water in the ocean. Thhe flooring around the main pool and surrounding area including the bar and snack bar is very slippery and we saw several people fall. Dangerous for anyone walking on it shoes on or not. We pay a yearly maitenance fee along with our membership and do not see anything being maintained except the gardens. If we did not have a membership my husband and I would avoid this chain completely. We were not treated as valued guests. The owners or upper management do not seem to care if their guests return. We certainly have regrets buying into the timeshare and do not recomend it. We have to return to this resort chain because of our timeshare and I think going to another resort in this chain will not help. cutbacks are usually made chain wide and I anticipate that the other resorts belonging to Viva Windham will be just as bad. Remember when they show you around trying to sell you a membership they will be showing you the best, most improved and recently renovated parts of their resorts. What you are shown is not necessarily what you will get. The good things were that the weather was perfect, the staff worked very hard to entertain us and the bartenders were good. The gardens were very well kept and the resort was clean. We didn't starve and for the first time ever we actually looked forward to going home. We went to Wllie with our concerns and he said he would present our concerns at a meeting that was to be held at a later time. He also gave us a free week which we appreciated but it does not make up for the 2 weeks of lack of sleep due to someones inability to fix the airconditioners, the poor quality of the food and the lack of maintenance to the rooms and pool areas. This was the worst and most disappointing holiday we have ever had.

The running water smells awful, like sulfur. -Too many kids, nothing against kids, but this is a family orientated resort. We didn't see anyone under 40 (except children) until our third day in.

It was OK but I would not return - nor would I recommend it. Firstly, we booked and paid for two rooms. When we checked in, they said that they didn't have two rooms for us, only one, so they wanted to offer us four 30 minute massages to compensate for this problem. They said that we'd get the second room that we had paid for on the next day. In fact, we did get the second room on day 2, but I started our vacation concerned that this wouldn't happen. Here are the positives about staying at the Viva Wyndham Maya: 1) The resort is in a great location along the beautiful beaches of Playa del Carmen. (But, of course, there are many other resorts to choose from along these beaches.) 2) I cannot complain about the cleanliness of the resort or the rooms. The ground were clean, the beaches were clean and the rooms were clean (although they are very \"plain Jane\" rooms. 3) It is only a $7 taxi ride to the beginning of the shopping area in Playa del Carmen. Here are the negatives: 1) The food was mediocre, at best. We enjoy dining as part of our vacation experience and the food at this resort was very disappointing. Although the a la carte restaurants provided better food and a better dining experience, they were far from outstanding. 2) Because of the way the \"open air\" hallway runs down the length of a stretch of rooms, the rooms were very noisy at night. The sound of voices and luggage rolling across the tile flooring echoed and carried. I sleep with ear plugs, yet I still work up each night to the noise. 3) From 5:30 - 6:00 pm, after the sun sets and after you've had dinner, there is very little to do at this resort until 9:30 when the \"entertainment\" begins. The entertainment was pretty cheesy. 4) If you want a palapa on the beach that will provide you with some shade, you better get your towels in place before 8 am, otherwise they will all be \"booked\", if not occupied.

We have been to 5 different hotels in Mexico and this one was, by far, our favourite. We travelled with 2 adults and 12 and 14 year old girls. When we first arrived we were greeted with a warm welcome, an easy check-in and fruit punch! Someone led us to our room while helping with our luggage. The hotel has 470 rooms but you would never know it. It is very spread out which gives you the feeling it is much smaller. There was a real mixture of guests from all over Canada, The States and Europe. ROOM Our room had 2 double beds, a bathroom and a small porch with 2 chairs. We find that most beds in Mexico resorts have very hard mattresses, but not these. They were very comfortable and perfect amount of covers but the actual beds are very low to the ground so may not be suitable for elderly people. The bathroom was average, had a new sink but older shower and toilet. Overall, the rooms are not outstanding but perfect for the amount of time you actually spend in it. STAFF / ACTIVITIES All of the staff were very friendly and worked very hard to make sure you were satisfied. They were always smiling and would happily start up a conversation with you. They led all the activities which were tons of fun for everyone in the family. You could participate in every activity or none at all, completely your choice. At the end of the day you got to go and enjoy a great 1 hour show which was very entertaining and different every night. FOOD Oh My Gosh. We have never had such delicious food, anywhere. The buffet, snack bar and restaurants are all AMAZING. We couldn't get over the variety and quality of everything. Delicious! POOL / BEACH Great pool with swim up bar and an area for small children. The ocean was warm, a bit rough, but still good swimming conditions. We highly recommend this hotel to families, friends and couples. The only people I wouldn't recommend this hotel is elderly people as you have to walk a few minutes up and down small hills to get from the lobby to the pool, the ocean was pretty rough and all around the pool area is very slippery (we actually watched 3 different people fall or slip).

The service, especially the bartenders/waitstaff, cleaning staff, activity staff and grounds people, was especially notable. The front desk & concierge could be friendlier. We loved the beach and pool. We booked the lowest price room (through Expedia) and ended up with an ocean view, mini bar with bottled water and sodas and flat-screen tv. Our room did face the courtyard near the stage where nightly shows were held around 9:30pm, so perhaps not the best room for people with small children (the shows were pretty loud), but it didn't really bother us. The selection at the buffet was good and we liked the featured items that were made to order (such as omelets and pasta). We booked our one restaurant reservation at the Mayan restaurant at the sister resort (Azteca) and liked it a lot. We stayed 4 nights, so we only got one reservation. We took advantage of the jacuzzi at the Renova spa (free to use!) and borrowed bikes to ride around the Playacar complex, which was fun. My only suggestion would be to add some variety to the nightly entertainment (more interactive things such as casino night or karaoke) rather doing exclusively big shows.

I'm a middle class guy from Boston who has been a few places. This resort is older and poorly equiped to serve the large crowd it attracts through pricing. I felt sorry for the staff who seemed to be working like dogs to keep up. The rooms are small, stark white. When the general lighting is on it looks like you're in an operating room. There's a little balcony. When you sit, your back is against the door and your knees up against a wall. I had two maids. One was swell, the other I had to leave notes for water, soap. You can't drink the tap water. This was the noisiest place I've ever stayed at. You hear everything going on in the hallway and outside (I wear two hearing aids). The low price crowd (families with many kids, Billy-Bobs, Beavis +Butthead types on spring break) can be up most of the night acting up like its their first trip. The food is below average and plenty of it. You have to look for something edible. Roasts, meats and fish are often overcooked and dry. The buffet can hold about 300 people and is so noisy you can't hear yourself think. So many people you're like a human pinball looking for food. Its a high school cafeteria with the same sort of food. There are no restrooms in the buffet area. You have to leave, go downstairs, across the lobby, past the lobby bar to get there. When you do, there is two stalls in the men's room. One of them is usually clogged or leaking. There is no pepper available unless you ask a waiter who has a grinder hidden behind a counter. One of the big dishes is re-heated pasta with you choice of mix-ins, which you'll have to wait in line for. We ate at a few of the restaurants, best was the Italian at the Azteca. The only advantage of the others was they're a little quieter than the buffet. This place has the worst towel campers I've ever seen. One towel across three chairs etc. Chairs in the shade can be gone by 8:00. Some of the chairs you see reserved this way nobody ever sits in them. There is not enough shade for the amount of people. If the shade under your palapa moves around a bit when you don't notice, you may have someone pushing up against you to get into it, usually someone from Europe. Other resorts I noticed provided umbrellas and shelters, not this place. There are shows every night, usually lip-synced dancers. Something to do after you eat. Most are entertaing but some are awful.(Comedy show). They have a trapeze which the young people enjoy. We went to Xcaret park which was fabulous. A really good value for what you get. I thought it was better than Xel-ha. The food there, though similar to the food at the Wyndham was much better due to proper preparation. At the Wyndham bars they have some good vodkas, Jim Beam and Canadian club (which may be hidden.) Someitmes a long line for drinks. Pool bar has seven or eight seats, doesn't open til noon. Bartender is not always there. Pool itself is small compared to other places. If you would like to sit down in the plaza or the lobby bar after dinner, forget it. The chairs are all gone. The beach is one of the top ten in the world. Its beautiful and walkable. Its usually windy, one day so much NO-ONE could get in past their knees. If you'e headed here and reading this, don't panic. The beach is nice, you won't starve and you'll manage OK. In my opinion, though, many small annoyances can mess up a good trip.

We got a room in a great location, close to stage and pool. Was very handy. They have top shelf liquor but you have to ask for it. Only had one water bottle in the room which didn't end up being a problem. We bought a second bottle when we went to Playa (20-25 min walk) and filled the bottles at the bar. They have water dispensers so you don't have to ask the bartenders to do it. Be very careful walking around the pool bar, very slippery. It wasn't so bad when I wore my runners and my husband said he didn't have a problem walking in his flip flops but my flip flops were horrible. Walk carefully until you know how your shoes are going to be. The food was okay. We don't go on holidays for fine dining. We always found something to eat.

If you crave nightlife, this isn't the place for you, but if you're looking for peaceful days and nights at a beachside resort, you can't do better. We were met with offers of a cool towel and a cold drink at check-in. It was before 3 and our room wasn't ready, so we hit the lobby bar (naturally!). Changed into our bathing suits and spent the afternoon in the main pool, meeting new people. The beach was great. I'm an early riser on vacation, so we always had chairs with a palapa. I saw some really beautiful sunrises, but you have to be out there by 6am because the sun comes up very quickly! I was disappointed to hear a woman bragging that she came down early to \"reserve\" chairs on the beach AND at the pool, so she could go between as she liked. Then she went back to bed. Really irritating to me. If we had chairs, we only left the area to get food, take a beach walk, etc. I'd never consider staking claim to something I wasn't planning to use. Our afternoon spot was the adult \"quiet\" pool--nice for meeting people and the bartender has enough time to chat. The only thing that's a bit different about this hotel, is that housekeeping isn't on any schedule I could figure out. One day at 10am, the next not until after 3pm. It didn't bother us, but if you need an afternoon siesta, you may want to hang the \"do not disturb\" sign. This resort is great. We probably won't be back next year, but only because we found ourselves saying \"did you bring the camera?\" only to realize there was nothing new to photograph!

The room we were assigned did not have hot water, there was mold along the shower door, the toilet tank leaked, the shower leaked, the door handle to the bathroom was rusted and barely attached, there were stains on the window curtain, the sliding glass door handle was broken, there were no washcloths, there were no bed spreads, the mini fridge was stocked with just two cans of pop, there was only one bottle of water for the four of us, there were only four small drawers forcing us to live out of our suitcases for all 10 days, the pillows were thin and uncomfortable, the d\u00e9cor was more akin to a barren white walled prison cell, lighting was limited to a single ceiling mounted bulb and wall mounted wall lights that pointed to the ground, the lights in the bathroom when shut off would flash like strobe lights continuously, and there was only one hook to hang towels from in the bathroom even though the resort was requesting guests to reuse towels instead of having them laundered. We also found the buffet restaurant to be crowded, dirty, noisy and like a school cafeteria in appearance and food quality. The tables did not have tablecloths and the staff would scrap crumbs off of the placemats onto the floor, leaving guests to reuse placemats meal after meal. Aside from the poor quality of the room at the Viva Wyndham Maya we also found many other issues that disappointed us with our choice in using Apple Vacations and staying at this particular resort. These issues include the following: The Whirlpool never worked. The \u201cstrong entertainment program\u201d was really just the playmaker staff attempting to perform dances and lip-syncing. The food at the buffet and snack bar was the exact same every meal on every day. One of the gym staff members (not Hector or Lestor) propositioned my wife for a \u201cspecial private message at his private location\u201d. The gym played the same CD everyday with foul language. This same CD was played while my 7 & 10 year old sons used the gym\u2019s rock climbing wall \u2013 one song in particular lyrics were \u201cP_$$y, P_$$y, ticky, ticky, lickie lickie\u201d over and over. In the 10 days we stayed at the resort there was only one theme night meal; other resorts we\u2019ve stayed at have always had several special theme nights. When the sliding glass door handle eventually fell off completely we showed it to the maid, she just left it in the room. We had to take the handle to the front lobby to get it fixed so we could lock our room. My wife questioned whether top shelf liquor was actual name brands or refilled bottles as she thought Compari was red not pink. At the Italian restaurant at the Azteca resort and Mexican Restaurant at Viva Maya we questioned when we ordered dinner if our children would eat the meals that were served. If there is a concern with serving children meals at these restaurants then there should be a child size portion available to families. The buffet often ran out of things to eat. If you got to breakfast at 8:00 there was plenty of food, but if you went at 9:00 there were no more eggs, French toast pancakes, etc. There was only one cook for the long lines of people wanting eggs, omelets or pasta meals. My son watched the person who cooked the hamburgers drop a piece of raw meat on the floor then proceeded to pick it up and place it on the grill. My wife got sick from the food on our second day. We felt like we had to go into Playa Del Carmen to actually get a descent meal. We booked this resort based on the 4-apple rating from Apple Vacations which described the resort as being \u201cA first-class resort hotel or condo with a good selection of guest services\u201d. We also conferred with the Viva Wyndham website which boasted the resort as having \u201cmodern facilities, modern d\u00e9cor, strong entertainment program and wonderful cuisine\u201d. After arriving at the Viva Wyndham Maya we quickly realized both Apple Vacations and Wyndham resorts grossly misrepresented the resort. If this had been our first trip to Mexico, or with Apple Vacations or at a Wyndham resort maybe our expectations would have been lower, however as experienced travelers we can certainly attest that the Viva Wyndham Maya should not have been rated 4 Apples or describe as \u201cfirst class\u201d by any means.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vegreville, Alberta, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDecent Place, Really Clean, Awesome Service\u201d", "Author": "ironpro", "ReviewID": "UR99786911", "Content": "Viva Wyndham is just the right size of place - not too big, not too small.

We totally loved it! At first glance, the rooms are very bare looking. We had a plain room with white bedspreads and walls, but the rooms were very, very clean, and had all we needed. The beds were comfy, and after staying in Jamaica 2 years ago, sleeping on a hard - marble like slab - these beds were great. NO bugs anywhere.... not even outside! This resort is extremely clean. We always saw someone out with a broom, or cleaning something. Rooms were very, very clean, and maids were very friendly too! cute little towel animals left everyday. No fridge in the room, but we were fine with that as well. We didn't spend much time in the rooms anyways, when there is the most beautiful beach just outside, why stay in the rooms. But all in all they were perfectly fine. The shower was great too! The staff was awesome. We had no troubles with check in or out, friendly.. we didn't have any complaints though, so we really can't speak to how the staff would've been if we had a complaint. We flew with Sunwing and our Sunwing rep Chris was fantastic!!! super awesome. Food was good. Again, nothing too fancy, but I am VERY picky and found something to eat at the buffet every day, and was never hungry. We never ate at the A la cartes, as we found having to make reservations interfered with our plans, so we ate at the buffet, and it was great.

All in all I would say this resort was great! We previously stayed at Riu Palace (a few resorts down) and Riu Pacifico in PV. Our review is based on comparison to 5*'s. FOOD - The food was great. It was your typical buffet - nothing over the top like the Riu's but really, how much food does one need? The pizza at the sports bar by the pool was really really good! They had theme nights for the buffet and we managed to go to all 3 a la cartes. We ended up walking up to the Don Diego one night around 6 and, because they had space, they seated us right away! What a blast at this restaurant, and the tequila at the end is amazing! ROOMS - We had room 2000 which was oceanfront, ground floor. AMAZING! It was really nice to just walk out to the beach from our room. The shower leaked a little bit but it was because the seal was loose on the shower door bottom so we just clicked it back on. The rooms are a little scarce but, clean bed, clean shower, tv...what else do you need? We were rarely in our room - mainly only to shower or sleep. They do only supply you with one water upon arrival to your room; however, we wrote the maids a note \"dos agua por favor\" and left it beside the tip and ALWAYS got two waters. My only complaint with the room was lack of facecloths...we never got any! BEACH/POOL - The beach was amazing. They have built the beach up and removed the sand bags since we were in the Mayan last (2009). There seems to be a shortage of beach chairs early afternoon; however, we were never without a chair. The chairs under the grass umbrellas are almost impossible to get: they were mainly gone by 6:30 am. We went in the pool twice - our time was mainly spent on the beach. They have a \"hot tub\" but don't turn the jets on and if you have kids, they have a good size kid-deep area. they also have a kids pool which is quite far compared to the main pool location (by the gym). My only complaint with the beach is people brining food from the sports bar and leaving their leftovers laying about - the segulls come in swarms! STAFF - Alfonso was amazing! He is THE omlette man! I made sure to tip him well as I got an omlette from him everyday! Jesus at the pool bar was great for a few laughs. The other resort staff are constantly on the go weather it be getting people to do resort activities, preparing for the evening show or doing the evening show. MAIN COMPLAINTS ~front desk staff seemed to be absent minded and not customer focused. ~gift shop employees are rude! We got asked to leave while shopping so the lady could take her break! Be aware: they will not take ripped/torn bills or any coins...even those of their own currency but they have no problem giving coin as change. ~seagulls on the beach. If people would just put their plates away or not bring food to the beach in the first place it would not be a problem! ~lack of seating. Their courtyard is huge yet their is no sufficient seating for the capacity of the resort. ~I definitely missed the waiter service by the pool/beach. At the Riu's we would tip our waiter well and have drinks non-stop throughout the day! ~safe is rather small - would not fit the standard size laptop. All in all our vacation was great! We really wanted to stay away from the Riu's as we had already gone to two. Certain things were dearly missed (as would be, they were both 5*'s). The grounds were very nice - lots of trees and natural plants. I would reccomend staying at this resort but keep in mind it is not a 5*.

We wanted to be on our own time schedule and not have to worry about making dinner reservations. While the buffet food is not the greatest, we always found something we like and were always full. The pool snack bar is great for late night snacks too. The drinks were plentiful and great. Just ask for specific liquor brands when ordering, so you dont get the cheap well liquor. No extra charge. The entertainment staff were so friendly. We got to know one of them and he was really helpful, taking us out on the catamaran for extra time and ate at the buffet with us a couple times. While the evening shows can be kinda cheesy, we loved them! Grab a couple cocktails and just enjoy. The staff are super talented! It only rained one morning during the 6 days we were there. while it was raining, we took the timeshare presentation as they offered us a free week stay in the future. We just had drinks the whole time, didnt feel pressured, then went on our way after about an hour. Bottom line, this is not a 5 star resort.

The resort is small, compared with some, and easy to navigate and scrupulously clean. The guests seemed to be a lot of Europeans, especially Italians, South Americans, particularly Argentineans rounded out by the usual US and Canadian citizens. An interesting mixture! ROOMS. Our rooms, which were the bottom of the range offered, were adequate and well looked after by the maid. They had minimal, but adequate storage space, excellent, free, inroom safe, flat screen TV., plenty of hot water and a very small patio area which we did not use. The comments about noise from the hallways are correct, but similar to many AIs. It is perhaps worse here due to the number of rooms with connecting doors which allow noise from your neighbors to enter freely. The beds were the usual mattress atop a concrete slab. However, we found them the most comfortable of the type we had slept on and had no trouble sleeping. GROUNDS. The grounds were beautiful, and extremely well designed, a mixture of \u201cforest\u201d, desert and a \u201cMayan Grotto\u201d with enough wildlife e.g. iguanas and agoutis to keep walks interesting and there were always the sound of bird calls. BEACH. The beach was great, white sand, blue sea. Plenty of loungers, most reserved early in the day, but we always found some whenever we looked and were able to move around, rather than always stay in one area. We even managed to collect a group of six quite easily in the middle of the afternoon in just a few minutes. ACTIVITIES They had plenty going on if you wished. Though they were a little erratic about starting times and, occasionally, places. Members of our group took part in the water aerobics, stretching, bocce and sailing. One of us took their free sailing lessons and test and was allowed to take others out in one of the Hobie Cats for 1/2 hour a day. ENTERTAINMENT. We personally found this quite weak, though it seemed to be enjoyed by many each night. It largely seemed to be the animation staff, lip synching and dancing to a series of songs around a theme. e.g. Madonna, as opposed to some of the more show based (lip synced) entertainments we have seen at other resorts. However, the performances by the trapeze and acrobatic staff were first rate and the Disney Night where a few animation staff led around 30 \u201ckids club\u201d members through various Disney movie songs was beautifully costumed and charming and amusing at the same time. FOOD. The buffet was of a similar standard to many AIs. We could always find something we wanted to eat. It was a little unusual in the number of stations for food cooked in front of you, for example, breakfast had the usual fresh omelet person, a egg and bacon person, a waffle and pancake person and a deep fried donut person and I may have missed some items. The buffet was crowded at peak times, so don\u2019t meet for breakfast at 9 am. for example 8:40 is better. We had no trouble in booking the six al a cartes we were entitled to at both the Maya and the Azteca. They were a pleasant change and, while not exactly gourmet standard, were close enough to be an enjoyable evening out. Our favorites were the Portofino at the Maya and the Bamboo and Mayan at the Azteca. Our least favorite was the Miramare at the Maya, though that was largely do to the fact that it looked as though the spot had been something else and they hadn\u2019t got round to decorating it to match it\u2019s new purpose. The snack bar was used by some of our group for a quick lunch by the beach, but most of us preferred to go back to the buffet for a break. BARS. The bars both served a wide variety of drinks efficiently and happily. Wait staff do a very efficient pick up of glasses, but you have to fetch your own drinks from the bar which entails a little queuing, but nothing onerous. The lobby bar and courtyard area were pleasant places to sit, but seating was at a premium at peak times. There is sufficient space to add more seating to alleviate this. There is little to do at this resort in case of bad weather and, in those times, indoor seating is not adequate, plan a shopping trip. EXCURSIONS. We went on four between us. Chichzen Itza, which is a must site to visit, but a very, long and tiring bus ride. Those of us who had been before gave it a miss. Xel Ha for snorkeling and an amazing day of beauty and nature, we all swore we would repeat and Sian Ka\u2019an Jeep tour which was amazing once we got to our fisherman guide and spent the day touring the wildlife of the enormous lagoon (turtles, dolphins, pelicans, ibis, spoonbills etc.) snorkeling on the reef, miles from shore, swimming on the smooth white sand beach and seeing the fishing village where our guide lived. However, the jeep ride portion was a spine shattering ride over seemingly endless miles of rock strewn limestone pot holes. SUNWING. We booked with Sunwing. Everything there and back was efficiently and professionally handled. The two reps based at the hotel were the best we have experienced. One, or both, were there during normal working hours, gave us their cellphone number for when they were not. They booked trips efficiently, gave us plenty of good advice and were always there to answer questions about the hotel and area in general or, just stop and chat with us, when they saw us in the lobby bar. Thank you Chris and Tiemo! SUMMARY. If you want a smaller, all inclusive, which is clean, friendly, in a great location, has a beautiful beach, all the basics and a little more (e.g. trapeze lessons) you can\u2019t go wrong with the Viva Maya.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Alberta", "Title": "\u201cDont believe resort info on internet\u201d", "Author": "mttaylor47", "ReviewID": "UR97842667", "Content": "This resort is a time share , we did not know this when we booked.

We ate at 5 of them - 3 at Azteca & 2 at Maya. We all enjoyed them. At the pool there is pizza every day, salads, guacamole, & several hot dishes. Unfortunately, there are several minuses. The back hotel surrounds the relaxing pool (adults) is newer than the front units. It is much quieter than the front units where the noise at times was really unbearable. Unfortunately, the back hotel is a bit of a walk to the beach & the first floor units have a terrible musty smell. The wines both red & white are HORRIBLE. If you are a wine drinker plan on going to Sam's Club & buying your own. We actually saw the bottles of wines that Viva serves for $5 for a gallon. TERRIBLE. All the crazy, fun mixed drinks are pretty good. If you tip the bartenders you'll definitely get plenty of booze. For some reason there are only salt shakers on the tables, if you want pepper you have to flag down a waiter & he will grind a bit of pepper. This was really annoying to the pepper lovers in our crowd. It took 3 moves before we finally got the connecting rooms that I had reserved.

Check in: Very fast, the staff were very efficient and polite. Room: Very basic, very clean. Ours didn't have a refrigerator but we found that we didn't miss it this trip. Our friends did have a fridge but I don't think they really used it because we were always on the go! The bed was more comfortable than other Mexican resorts we've stayed at. Unfortunately there weren't many drawers to lay out our clothes but i really didn't care too much. The air conditioning was working almost too well. We had to turn it down in the evenings, and completely off most nights. The water pressure was fantastic and there was never a shortage of hot water no matter what hour we showered at. Pool: Never did get to the pool or the pool bar! They looked nice and there was often activities in the main one. Spent all our time on the beach! Beach: Very nice, the water was great! No need for shoes in the water on this beach as there were no rocks when you went in as we've found at other resorts in the Mayan. Saw some sting rays right off our beach. The para sailing looked like fun but we didn't get around to doing it...maybe next trip! My only complaint is the people who come down to claim a chair in the shade at the crack of dawn but don't show up to use them until 3 pm! Bars: They have a great list of drinks and I'm afraid we tried almost all of them. There was lot's of seating in the lounge bar area with a big open area as well. Food: We ate at the buffet a couple of nights. It was good food with lots of choices. I've been to resorts with much larger buffets, but this was more than enough for us. I had ice cream for desert every night! We ate at the Mexican, Italian, and Asian a-la-cartes. All were very good and I still managed to eat ice cream for desert at each of them! They had great burgers at the beach snack bar, and never a shortage of guacamole or salsa, yum! Location: Can't beat the location, a quick 5 minute cab ride to 5Th ave. Entertainment: We only got down to see one of the shows, the comedy night. It was very funny, my guts were hurting after! There was one of the staff who played the piano in the lounge bar a few nights which was nice with some drinks before dinner. Spa: I never did the spa, but one of the girls in our group went 3 times! She said it was fantastic and the price was a lot less than what she pays in Canada. She had a couple of massages and a mud wrap (I think) This resort is ideal if you don't want to do a ton of walking to get around it. We booked last minute and got a great deal and I wouldn't hesitate to go again (if the right deal came up!) There wasn't as much live music as we've enjoyed at other resorts, but we were on 5Th ave most nights anyway! We did do some excursions too. We haven't had a bad excursion yet.

Also there is a Drug and Deli across the street. The resort is very clean and the staff is very friendly! The A La Carte restaurants were great and the buffet and snack bar was right about what we expected. It was nice that they offer soup daily at the snack bar as well as fresh salsa and tortilla chips. Most of us enjoyed the pizza as an afternoon snack. Our room was far away from our friends so they offered to move us, but as it turned out our room was larger and more recently updated, so we choose to stay where we were. Staff was always friendly and accomodating. However it was very loud in the hall ways when people were coming in late at night and everything echoes. Our friends that did move by the pool area were very upset with the noise and had many sleepless nights or extremely early mornings! (staff were working right outside their window as well as people \"testing\" the microphones near the theatre?!?!?) In general though, the noise where we were was somewhat tolerable. The staff really puts out a huge effort to entertain everyone as well as make you feel comfortable! Very friendly warm atmosphere and they try very hard to put on entertaining nightly shows. We ventured into Playa del Carmen and ate at a few restaurants: \"La Pesca\", \"Carlos and Charlie's\" and attended a wine tasting with a catered meal at \"Off the Vine\". All meals were fabulous. Carlos and Charlie's is a fun party atmosphere and the others were more relaxed. We taxied into Playa and took the collectivo bus to Akumal where we swam with sea turtles and sting rays at Turtle Bay. We rented all our gear as well as a locker there and spent the day with a local guide who took us to Half Moon Bay as well as Yal Ku for more fabulous snorkelling. He then suggested a quaint little restaurant right across from the Akumal Dive shop where the food was amazing! The fishermen were carrying in there latest catch as we were enjoying our meal!!!!

From Dyadha's help answering our initial pre-booking inquiries to her amazing service with a smile when we got there we knew that we were in for a good time. The entire staff was simply amazing and went out of their way to make sure that we had the best vacation possible. There were so many who stood out that I cannot list them all. Bartenders, maid service, front desk, bell hops, concierge, guest services, grounds keepers, waiters and entertainment staff - all first class. We booked reservations at all 3 restaurants and the food and service was excellent. The buffet, well it is a buffet and we had no complaints. The pasta and Omelet station were fabulous and a real hit. Again the service really stood out. The line ups for the bars, buffet and activities was minimal. Other than waiting a few people for Omelets or Pasta the line ups were minimal. Bar service at both the Lobby bar and the Pool bar as well as the Azteca were quick and with a smile. Ask for it and they whipped it up. Teenagers loved the snack bar with the Wood oven thin crust pizza, burgers, turkey dogs, wings, nuggets, fries and a short hot buffet that could be had late into the night. Not sure how late but at 2 they were still getting pizza? You can eat and drink at the Maya or the sister property the Azteca. When we walked to Playa Del Carmen we stopped at the Azteca for a drink and a snack on the way home at night. The beach was spectacular. We took out the Kayaks a few times and borrowed snorkeling gear from the dive shop. (great crew there and we are planning on going back for our PADI cert later in the summer). There is nothing to see at the beach when snorkeling but for $35 you can go out on a short snorkeling excursion right from the hotel. At the suggestion of our SunWing rep Chris, we booked an full day excursion with Mayan Treasures to Coba. Luis (hope I spelled that right) who was our guide was excellent and really knowledgeable on the history which really added to the trip. He took us to a small restaurant for diner, swimming at a Cenote and to a Mayan Village to meet and share music with the people. This is a must do excursion for sure! I read all the reviews on here before booking in the first place and based on my experience this is a great value for a family vacation.

This was our second stay at the Maya. My husband and I stayed here in March of 2010, and as we were bringing our friends with us this time we wanted to bring them somewhere we knew would be good. The first time we took the bus provided by Sunwing from the airport, and after several stops we finally got to the Maya, however it was interesting to see where the other hotels were located.... So this time I contacted the hotel and arranged for our own pick up with a van for the six of us. They were very prompt in replying to my email and had arranged Kuluba Tours to pick us up with very good intructions as to where to meet. It was $39 US a person for pick up and return to airport. We felt this was worth it vs riding the bus. It still was an hour long trip, as they certainly have many speed bumps along the way. Check in went very quickly, however since we were second timers and had booked this trip in May of 2010 and they knew we had a group of six and we had asked for our rooms to be close together facing the pool- we thought this would happen. Two of the rooms were close together, our first room was very smelly I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep in it, so I went back to the front desk and they immediately gave us another room, however none of our rooms had a fridge in it like we had in March. The location of this hotel is perfect, inside a gated community, you felt very safe. Walking distance to Playa Del Carmen for shopping and restaurants and places to watch the Canadian Jr. Hockey final at........ :( .... Highly recommend \"Carlos'N Charlie's\" and \"Los Rancheros\"- the Mayan coffee they made was superb! Only a $5 cab ride back to hotel if you didn't want to walk. We never had any trouble booking a la carte's, even booked one at the Azteca as well, the Bamboo there was great. New Year's Eve was fantastic, lots of extra staff around, champange and the usual hats and horns. They had a live band and also dinner at all the a la cartes had the same menu for that night, steak and lobster. I found it not the greatest meal, but cooking for that many people at once would be difficult. However one of our friends with us said that it was delicious! Everyone has their own preferences. We found there was always something good at the buffet and the a la cartes were all good. The doughnuts at breakfast were absolutely perfect to top it off, that's what holidays are about right!? We did two excursions and highly recommend going to Xel-Ha, do the day trip, we also booked our own transportation and it was only $5 more per person, so again we didn't have to stop at any other hotels to pick people up. The Coba Mayan Encounter trip was also great, go first thing in the morning to Coba as when we were leaving, there were hundreds of people coming up the path I couldn't imagine climbing it with that many people on it at the same time. Not for the little children or elderly! A couple of our husbands complained of sore legs for days!! But we were certainly glad we went I believe it is the only ruin left that people are still allowed to climb, the rocks are getting very slippery so it's just a matter of time before it too will be closed for climbing. The staff at the a la carte booking desk were very friendly and the lady at the tour desk was exceptional, I wish I could remember her name. We booked our excursions through her this time, as when we were there in March we booked with Sunwing, mainly because they were always present. This trip I would have to say Sunwing really let us down... We only saw the one Rep they had the first day we were there and the last. He said he would be at his desk during certain hours everyday, but whenever we went he was never there. When we were checking out he happened to be at the front desk, I told him that our group of six would not be on the bus to the airport as we had arranged our own transportation. I thought maybe that would be useful information as 'would you not have the list of names for pick up'? We didn't want anyone waiting for us. He said no that didn't matter.... We didn't have to leave the hotel as early as the bus because of our direct trip. To make a very long story some what short Sunwing had our arrival time to our home airport in the departure time column from Cancun, so therefore we understood as well as another group from our hotel that our flight was delayed six hours. He did say to check the bulletin the day before we left for any changes at the briefing meeting the first day. We checked immediately just to check it and it looked like our return was already delayed at that time six hours. We kept checking it during our two weeks there and it never changed, so yes we missed our flight! Along with another group of people, we tried to find the Sunwing rep to help us, a man from the other group got him on the phone he was very rude and he refused to come to our hotel to help us find a way home. So we ended up booking online with Westjet and actually got on a flight the very next morning at our expense of course. So we had to pay for another night, they wanted $120 a person, however we asked if two of the couples shared a room if we could get a cheaper rate....we did ...ended up paying $200 a couple, so they got $400 for that night. We asked for a wake up call at 6am, never happened! Could have been very costly again had we missed that flight, happened to wake up at 6:30 and made the flight! But the extra last doughnut made things go better!! You just have to take things as it happens sometimes. Have not heard if we will be reimbursed from Sunwing for sure. We did save receipts and have a copy of the wrong fight schedule Sunwing posted on the board. Felt Sunwing left us hanging and maybe the hotel could have gave us a better break on the night's rate, it wasn't like we were going to be staying all day the next day eating and drinking. However I know it wasn't their fault, they were helpful with us using their phone, photocoping and printing our new flight schedule off. So great hotel for location, food, beach, activites, near shopping, entertainment at night - however most of the nights it was a little late for us so we didn't stay up for all of it. Have to say though the house wine was terrible!! Please hotel take note, there were so many left over full glasses of wine it is such a waste, better to just pour it out! Please upgrade your house wine... We usually bought a bottle at the a la carte nights. One more thing, I met with Marco Castillo to find out information about possibly having our daughters wedding there next winter, he was very nice and helpful. I would have no worries if we decide to have the wedding there.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cedar Rapids, Iowa", "Title": "\u201creading 100's of trip advisor reviews paid off, fantastic stay\u201d", "Author": "VacationplannerJan11", "ReviewID": "UR95617939", "Content": "I feel obligated to write a review since I used this website extensively to make our decision to book a group of 6 couples ages 38 to 48 yrs old for a 1 week vacation end of January '11. . The pros most definitely outweighed the cons, and we will most likely be booking another group vacation next year. PROS: Everything very close and easy walking, grounds are beautiful and well kept. Resort not too big, we could always find each other. Beach is fantastic and well kept, lots and lots of cabana type umbrellas to provide shade, plenty of beach loungers. Access to buggie boards, kayaks and catamarans, pool smaller than other resorts, but never felt crowded. free wyfi in two different areas - up by the lobby and down below by the pool area. (this was a big plus for our group, that we did not expect free wyfi), Just ask the front dest for a card with login password. wonderful bar service and bar drinks (our group liked the drinks) we expected watered down drinks, but the opposite is true.....ask for top shelf if you want it......we did tip liberally and consistantly, that could of helped, not sure, but our group expects to tip.....everyone has to make a living. Enjoyed the ala carte restuarants, our favorite was the Italian at the sister resort (Azteca). Buffet food was good, we weren't that picky, just glad not to be doing the cooking like at home. Omblettes to order were very good, another grill making eggs as you want them, fresh fruit was fantastic. The lunch and evening buffets were good also, we knew we didn't pay for 5 star. They had purified water available in many places, easy to refill water bottles or just get a glass of water. CONS Expected this, but very true....The tiles around the pool area are VERY SLIPPERY, don't go barefoot with wet feet, make sure you wear your sandals. 3 of the 12 of us slipped going into the pool at the top step, This is my only reason I may look at another resort next year, but gotta get a vote from the entire group, it seems silly to leave because of that, but if anyone in our group would get injured, I would feel terrible. A few couples did not have alarm clocks in their room, requested them and never received them. Another couple requested an extra blanket, took a day to get that. Beds were so, so, prob more on the hard side....it all depends what you like Expected this also and holds true....the front desk staff were not that pleasant. They talked fast and answered phone calls while also trying to check us in. This is minor, as we did not need to use the front desk very often. Hints: Be persistant to reserve your dinner reservations. We did this the first night and booked all 3 restuarants that night. (we split up with 2 tables of 6 each) We used 5 star cab service from airport to hotel, they were excellent ($150 for 8 people, both ways) Booked them ahead of time, and they were holding up our name when we got out to the cab area. Go into Play Del Carmen...$5 cab ride each way. Fun to shop and look around. We discovered a wonderful massage place named \"Sabai\" was located right on 5th Ave, between 6th and 8th streets. Massages were 2 for $50, best massages that many of us have ever had. By the end of the stay we booked 14 massages at Sabai, several of our gals getting 2 each. The resort had a special for $50 on the beach, not bad price, 4 did do massages up in the spa area instead of beach for same price, they were happy, but not as happy as Sabai. ENJOY:) All 6 couples enjoyed this vacation very much. The resort was the perfect size for us, we enjoyed the beautiful scenery and wonderful weather....sunny everyday, so much different than home, so glad to be on vacation. Our top priorities were: nice beach in the Riveria Maya area, not a lot of walking on resort grounds, and resonable price.

Just book it! I agree with the other positive reviews and will try and just write about other stuff that can help you determine where you should go. I have stayed in resorts all over the caribbean ( 2.5 star to 5+ star) and enjoyed my stay at Viva Maya. If you are unhappy with this place you are picky and need to book yourself into a fancy 5 star hotel. I suggest the Riu Palace or Riu Playacar. I often wonder why these unhappy people expect everything on a budget. For the money this place is definitely worth it. The hotel is in Playacar which is a gated community right next to Playa del Carmen. This means that it is very safe. Any locals entering by vehicle have to pass by a gaurded station and hand in their license in order to enter. Also in this area are several other resorts so its like a small resort town. I think this is better than staying at a hotel that is all by itself and further away from things. Clean rooms, with full balcony or terrance and renovated bathrooms. No things are not super fancy but they are nice. Our room had a king size bed, full bathroom, hair-dryer, iron, mini-bar and a terrace as we were on the ground floor. A couple of weeks before we went I emailed the hotel and asked for a room with a king size bed and a mini-bar. They replied the next day saying they would try their best. We got what we asked for and were very close to the beach, pool and snack bar. We were in room 1109. Yes many of the rooms have a connecting door but I only heard next door once when the hair dryer was turned on. The rooms run along either side of the resort. Even numbered rooms face the inside of the resort, odd numbers face the outside. Our room was about 4 back from the beach on the East side and we faced the Sport Shack. All rooms are angled towards the beach so we did have a beach view. POSITIVES - Smaller resort compared to others. This means less walking as everything is within a 5min walk. Also good when you want to be on the beach as you dont have as many people sharing space unlike some of the larger hotels. - The rooms start where the beach is so everyone is fairly close to the beach (unless you are in the 3000 section). This is a positive when you need to go back to your room for something. -I liked the fact that the snack bar, pool and pool bar are right next to the beach. Everything is close by and you dont have to go far. -Hotel is on a beautiful part of the beach, I would say the nicest part. -Hotel is across the road from the Playacar market. -Playa del Carmen is a 20min - 30min walk (depending on how fast you are.) You can walk to it on the beach or on the road. The road has sidewalks on either side and the whole area is well tended to. There are also a few Mayan Ruins you can see if you take the road. Day or night there are always people along the road. -Hotel has bicycles. This is a great way to get to Playa del Carmen. We took them out three different times. You get a lock and there are bike racks in town. -Cab rides are $5 to get into Playa del Carmen. -Everyone that works at the hotel is very friendly -Food was good. Yes like any buffet you get tired of it but at every meal there was chicken, pork, beef and white fish. The fresh tortilla's and nachos are really good. They have different themes for the buffet and whenever they made traditional mexican food it was the best. For breakfast they make homemade donuts. I am not much of a donut person but these were hard to resist. -Large courtyard with nice patio furniture to sit at any time of the day. A nice place to have drinks before and after dinner. -All bars serve a large selection of drinks including Martini's, mixed drinks, blender drinks and coffee/cappucino/expresso. -Snack bar has a wood burning stone pizza oven that made good thin crust pizza. -Playacar only an hour away from airport. -if you bring your computer you can get an internet signal at either bar. -the grounds are really nice. Lots of trees and plants. We enjoy horticulture and appreciated them labelling the trees and plants. The middle part of the hotel is a canopy of green. We only saw one show and it was pretty good. We usually ate around 9pm to avoid a busy dining room and kids eating. The only negative I have was caused by other people. Due to the snack bar being close to the beach people bring plates of food on the beach. This becomes a problem when the seagulls smell the food. If someone left their plate they were all over them. Also creates a poop hazard! But those with commen sense didnt bring food on the beach. There is really no need as there are places to sit and eat right next to the beach. Also some people have no manners and will cut in line but these problems have nothing to do with the resort. We had a great time and if you are comparing this resort to the others in Playacar around the same price I would book this one. You will have less walking, good food and great location with all the amenities you need. If you go into Playacar eat lunch at one of the mexican restaurants along 5th Ave. Nothing like guacamole made tableside (we at at Frida's and really enjoyed it). We went over to Cozumel. Did snorkling and rented scooters. Snorking isnt that great for the trips as the best spots to see are too deep to see snorkling...you need to dive. Also if you get sea sick dont attempt the ferry to the island as you will probably be sick. The scooters were a fun way to see the island. We each got our own. I had never driven one and they are easy to use. You can also rents cars or jeeps. We went to Coba as a day trip. The last Mayan Ruins that you can actually climb up as you cant at Chichen Itza or Tulum anymore. If you want to go to the top of one temple it is 120ft and has a nice view once you are up there. They also took us to a Mayan Village. They still live the same way they have for hundreds of year. When the movie Apocolypto was made by Mel Gibson years ago about 30 people from this village were flown to Guatamala to be in the movie. Their village only just got hydro a month ago. Mel Gibson as a thank you came back and built them a bunch of cement buildings to live in but they insist on living in their shacks and use the new buildings for storage. They have a medicine woman, a shamann and grow everything they eat. Kind of neat to see!

The check in process was slow as there was one person on staff for about 20 people checking in, but what can you do at 1am. I was a bit nervous in opening up the door to our room as we have had problems in the past with broken A/C's, toilets, and bad views at other resorts in Mexico, but we were pleasantly surprised. The room was basic, clean and comfortable. It was newly remodeled with a nice paint job, nice bedding, flat screen TV, and a lovely bathroom. There was no fridge in the room, and we only got 2 bottles of water for an entire week (tipping doesn't help this situation so we bought bottles of water from the gift shop). Other than that, it was a nice room with a nice balcony that was always used. We tipped the maid and got lovely swans, turtles, and peacocks on our bed made from the towels. The hallways were somewhat noisy at night, but quieted down after 11. The safe in the room was a great idea and ours worked great. We were glad we were on the top floor as the views were the best. We were in the 2400 section of the resort. If you were in the 3000 section, you would be at the back of the resort, which in my opinion, wasn't the greatest as it was a fair hike to the beach, but the rooms were better there. Enough about the rooms as we weren't there for them in the first place. The food was great. Lots of choice and variety for a vegetarian and meat and potato eater. The snack bar by the pool has really good wood fired pizza, and fresh fruit, salad, yogurt, pastries, nachos, rice, chicken, pork, soup, burgers, and hot dogs. What more could you ask for when snacking on the beach. We never ate lunch at the buffet rrestaurant because the snack bar had everything we needed. The buffet food was good for breakfast and dinner. Again, lots of choice from pasta, fish, chicken, pork, Mexican food, salads, soup, bread, fruit, cheeses, and pastries. We ate at the Mexican and Mediterranean restaurants while we were there. Try to reserve early in your stay as the times fill up quickly. We preferred the food at the Mexican restaurant better, but they were both lovely dining experiences. There were lots of activities to do there and the entertainment staff made sure you had a good time and were never bored. The shows at night were somewhat cheesy, but it kept us entertained. The kids club for the young ones seemed like it was well run and the kids were happy. The lobby bar had the best drinks in my opinion and the courtyard was the best place to have a drink in the evening (if you could find a seat). There were a lot of European people there who were rude and pushy, but you got used to it after a day or so. Tipping is always welcomed and the staff prefer US dollars to pesos. The location of the resort was great. A $50.00 peso taxi ride (or $5 US) to Playa del Carmen, or about a 30 min walk. There were always lots of taxis available when you walked outside the resort. There were also bikes you could rent too. There was a market right outside the resort called Plaza Playacar that had good prices on things and was really convenient. There were also lots of beach loungers to choose from and you never had to get up at 6am to fight for a spot. The beach in front of the resort was lovely, soft, and wide. The pools were a bit cool so we swam in the sea which was good. I wouldn't recommend swimming in the sea for first time swimmers, or people scared of water as the current was somewhat strong, but it was fine for people used to swimming and very relaxing. The grounds of the resort were lovely to walk throughout. Lots of iguanas and little critters that looked like big rats were roaming around, but were harmless and fun to watch. I would stay here again if the opportunity came up and would recommend it to other people looking for a relaxing vacation with lots to do and see.

Don't go if you expect luxury, cause you won't find it here. Rooms When we got to the room, we quickly identified three fixes: 1. the safe was locked - but the lock-up guy (they only have one) came by the next day and fixed it. 2. the electrical wiring was wrong: the bed lights could not be turned on without the rooflight being turned on. Okey - so this puzzled me: it was three years since the hotel was renovated, and since then not a single guest has complained that you couldn't use the bedlights separately??? Anyway, the electrical guy came by the next day and fixed it. 3. The toilet didn't stop running until you pushed back the handle with force. I can push a handle, so again no big deal. BUT, there was also three problems with the room that couldn't be fixed: 1. Sound... The walls were thick enough, but the door to the corridor and the window were not - so sounds travelled. AND more disturbingly, the rooms are built as doublets, with the interconnecting door VERY poorly isolated. It literally felt like our neighbours were in our room when they \"did it\" at four in the morning. Fun or inspiring to some, but I found it rather disturbing. Bring your earplugs!!! 2. Balconies are of differing size, but all are quite small. Two chairs and a minitable but really cramped. 3. there are few drawers or other places to put away your clothes, and no hangers on the walls. Aside from these issues, the rooms were quite big, two big queen-size beds (no problem to sleep two in each). I noticed some rooms have king size beds, and those were probably built for four - they were wider than they were long! The TV was big and worked well. Plenty of channels in english, one or two in german or french. Our room was very well cleaned every day. Unfortunately the cleaning staff came some days in the morning and some days in the afternoon, and since our boy likes to nap after lunch that was an issue, but not a big one. Irritating that the rooms (at least in the 2000-wing) did not have a refrigerator. It is easy to walk down to the pool bar but it is not quite the same. 2. food There were three a la carte restaurants, a snack bar by the pool and then the buffet. All of them had good, attentive staff and the buffets were replenished often. We did not get sick from any food here. Unfortunately the food in all restaurants were too bland: maybe it is enough to say that both me, my wife and our 6-year old agreed that the pasta and the hamburgers were the best food in the hotel? It was not bad, and the variety was good. But where were the hot sauces, or the tasty stews, anything for a change? Vegetables were good, and if you like icecream you can have dessert every day. 3. Pool and beach The Maya has two pool areas: one up by the reception that is for adults only, and one big area down by the sea. Neither felt cramped - you could always find a chair even if it might not be exactly where you wanted. As in every hotel, people hog their chairs early in the morning and then leave for half a day before they come back to use them. Off with their heads!!! One problem with the big pool: it is only 1.10 meters deep all over. So our boy didn't reach the bottom anywhere, and I could not dive anywhere either. The \"adult only\" however had an excellent slope, so why not let the kids use it? Stupid. Another problem with the pool area is that it is open down towards the beach, and days when the wind blows hard from the sea, both the beach and the pool area are hit by the same wind. The Azteka (sister hotel) has their pool a bit higher up from the ocean, so it is better shielded. 4. Staff The activity staff worked hard and seemed to like it - we liked them a lot. The kid's corner tried too, but since our boy doesn't speak english or spanish he never participated. I can't fault the staff for that. The restaurant staff work hard and are very good. The reception desk are so-so - some of them not very helpful. The guest service desk once told me that the a la carte restaurants were fully booked (you need reservations) when they were not. So if they tell you the same, come back in ten minutes and talk to someone else - that might help. The barmen at the pool seemed drunk from 11 am onwards - telling silly jokes, dropping things and spicing the drinks - I once had to tell them that I was picking up a softdrink for my kid, so they should go slow on the vodka!!! 5. activities as mentioned, the activity staff was great. There was a lot do do: an excellent gym, plenty of kayaks to borrow, tennis courts, volley ball - all in good condition. Every day dance lessons, dart competition and water polo, plus aerobics twice a day. The nightly entertainment was pretty short around 30 min, and not exactly Broadway material, but still gifted amateurs. Internet costs 50 pesos for one hour or 150 pesos for 5 hours. Since you can pause your access and start again next day, a 5-hour pass lasted more than a week. It can unfortunately only be used outdoors in the bar or by the reception, would have been nice to have it in the rooms. 6. Location Playacar is a bit off, but since the hotel lend bicycles for free that is not a problem. They also have child seats or bikes for children, so families can go down to 5th avenue too. 7. Good to know You should think over where you want to stay. There are three wings: the 1000, 2000 and 3000-wing. The 3000 are between the reception and the road - quite far from the pool and theater, but probably the most quiet part of the hotel. The 1000 and 2000 are on either side of the public areas. Rooms with an odd number are turned towards the public area, whereas even numbers are towards the neighbouring hotels. Low numbers are close to the beach, high numbers close to the reception. So 2310 is in wing 2000, third floor, close to the beach and turned away from the public areas. 2387 is in wing 2000, third floor, close to the reception and turned towards the public areas. We had 2x22 which had some sea view, a very small balcony and was not disturbed by sounds from the disco or pool since we were turned away. We liked the location but if you want more buzz, you should probably ask for an odd number. I heard one couple complain that they could not sleep on the other side of the corridor, so you need to prioritize... 8. final comment We had a nice vacation, and liked Playa a lot. The hotel was OK, but as I said in the beginning, we did not find it exceptional and if we go back to Mexico, we will probably go to a different hotel.", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prescott, AZ", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value!

A bonus for shopper: the hotel is in walking distance of Playa del Carmen & the ferry to Cozumel. Take the ferry and snorkel or scuba in Cozumel, well worth it! The only negative: there were no places set aside for non-smokers. We had to be in smoke at the beach, pools, outside bars, theater area and outside buffet.

The service was very very good! Our group is very polite and good tippers so we got almost all our drinks delivered to our table no matter where we were even one afternoon at the beach. The service really drops off for those who are not polite and Don't tip!!!!! Its all up to you...... The rooms are plain but perfectly fine and very clean and spacious enough. Everything worked. Beware of the \"in room safe\" as one guest had the batteries go dead and with ours we simply put in the wrong combination when we last locked it. Make sure you get it right or you may not get access till the next day. You may want to ensure others have money to lend you like we did. I totally agree with most others that the service, location, beach etc were beyond my expectations for sure. Infact on the entire strip our beach was by far the best! Myself and some of our group found the food as being \"not very good at all\". WE have had the pleasure to visit many resorts therefore I some experiences to compare to. Breakfast: Omelette station was not too bad sometimes they ran out of ingredients, or you could get fresh fried eggs which were very good. Otherwise if you you don't like fruit for breakfast then very limited selection which may make for a long week! Also their warming trays in most cases don't keep the food warm. Lunch Buffet: Much the same food every day. Many people stuck with the pasta station all week. Not much different in the menu so if it does not please you by day two then don't expect it to get much better. Good soups! Dinner Buffet: Not much different than the lunch buffet. Although they had ribs one evening. Watch out for the grilled chicken which was actually rather good but watch that the thick pieces are indeed cooked. Roast pork was pretty good as well. There is a good enough selection of meats to choose from only side dishes are limited. Pool bar buffet: The wood baked oven delivered thin crust pizza which I enjoyed as well as the fries. BEWARE of the hotdogs as they are \"turkey dogs\" and are totally disgusting!! I truly enjoyed my stay at this resort in fact it was excellent beyond my expectations for the price we paid. Perhaps that is why the price was so reasonable as the food imo lacked flavour and selection and the warming trays did not adequatlely keep SOME foods warm.

Nevertheless I never thought that it was going to have poor service when it came to solving problems for the guests. If your stay is uneventful I'm sure you won't have any problem with this hotel. The problem arises when you have an issue. Then the lack of customer services will make your stay unbearable. Full Story-- My wife and I decided to stay in the Wyndham Maya last November because it looked nice and it was well located. We were traveling for a wedding in Xcaret and we wanted to stay with the bride & groom (that stayed in this hotel too). In terms of \"cleanliness\" I don't have anything to complain. The rooms in general were clean and the public bathrooms too. Not necessarily true for the buffets and some areas around the swimming pools but that is ok, it is understandable. In terms of \"location\", I like where it's located. The hotel is located in Playacar. Playacar is a neighborhood next to the town of Playa del Carmen. You can walk from the hotel to Playa del Carmen in 30 minutes. In terms of \"rooms\", this is definitively the cheapest hotel in Playacar so the rooms are not quite \"luxurious\". If I needed to compare it to a 3 star hotel in the US, I'll say that the room at this hotel are average. The problem is that you need to compare it to the other hotels in Playacar with the same price range and in that case the rooms are less than average. There is no internet connection in the rooms. The wi-fi (internet cloud) doesn't even get near to the rooms. In terms of \"value\", this hotel is cheap so for those trying to save a buck or two, it could look like a great option. Now, the problem is that in reality you have to pay for some services that I found important. For example, internet. You need to pay for internet (common in some of the hotels in Playa del Carmen not in others). The problem is that even when you pay you are going to have problem with it. First, internet almost never works, even when you are in the recommended locations. Second, you have to logging every time to want to use it. It doesn't allow for an automatic connection and the logging process is really really painful because the password assigned to you has 16 characters that are randomly selected. So every time you log in you need to pull out your receipt to remember the password. Third, there are only 2 locations where you get internet (next to the lobby and next to one of the swimming pool). No internet in the rooms. In terms of \"sleep quality\" the rooms were below average. The beds were ok but the walls are relatively thin. So if you can sleep with noise outside your room, this hotel should be ok with you. In terms of \"service\", it was terrible. The people serving us in the buffet were great. The same for those supporting the different activities. The problem was more with the people in the front desk, customer service and concierge service. When you reserve at this hotel they tell you that you have some choices additionally to the restaurant-buffet. For the Wyndham, these options are basically 6 restaurants, 3 in the Maya location and 3 in the Azteca location. What they never tell you is that to reserve in any of these restaurants you need 2-3 days in advance. This logistics doesn't make sense when you are staying in the hotel less than 4 days. It is really difficult to reserve a table in any of these restaurants. They are always \"full\". The funny thing is that when you go to the restaurant directly you can see that half of the tables are empty for those days were they were supposed to be \"full\". My believe here is that this illogical arrangement has to do with two things: 1. They need to know in advance the number of people to be able to prepare (and that's ok). 2. the hotel limits the amount of people eating in each restaurant each night to avoid losing money (and that's not ok-- don't give me a false sense of options when you can't deliver on those options). Other comments-- Everything was going \"so-so\" until the other wedding guests started to arrive. The bride & groom had organized several tours and the meeting point was the Wyndham Maya. When the first group arrive to the hotel, the security guard didn't allow them to enter the property. We understood that because it was an 'all-inclusive' we would have this problem. Nevertheless we thought that we could reach an agreement were for example all the wedding guest could meet in the parking lot of the hotel (without entering the hotel). The security manager didn't allow us to do that. We were furious because the manager had told 3 months ago the bride & groom that they would allow the hotel to be the meeting point. We didn't want the wedding guest to enter the hotel and consume without paying, we just wanted to meet somewhere so we could decide where to go after. Pretty simple but the Wyndham Maya employees were not even trying to help us at this point. The next day we had a similar problem with an even more irrespectful Wyndham Maya employee and this time it wasn't with any wedding guest but with the parent of the bride. To make the story short we decided to leave the hotel. All the wedding guests staying at the Wyndham Maya decided the same. That day 20 people left the hotel (~10 rooms) and the manager didn't do anything to stop it until it was really too late. We decided to switch hotels and went to the Mosquito Blue in Playa del Carmen.

In a word it was an awesome trip, very little could have been better, just returned on the 8th of January. We stayed at the Wyndham Maya, and the trip was booked through Sunwing. The flights and transfers were absolutely painless, and well planned out, with no surprises. The hotel was fantastic, check-in and everything was very smooth. The room was great, nice and clean and had everything we needed. The staff at the resort was simply awesome, took very good car of us and was extremely friendly; we couldn\u2019t off asked for anything better. We did do a little shopping of 5th avenue, and it was getting a little tiresome of people trying to sell us everything and anything, but that was to be expected. All in all nobody was rude and they were only doing what they do, lot\u2019s of neat things to see though. We also went on one excursion to Xcaret, and it was ok, very pretty park, but some of the attractions were a bit of a let down from what I was expecting, and should of stuck with my gut and went to Xelha. The show at the end of the evening was very good though. Back to the Wyndham Maya we spent most of our time at the beach but also book snorkeling and para-sailing with the guys who run the shop at the beach. Francesco was awesome to deal with , and all the guys were really good. The staff at the bar, the restaurants and buffets were all great as well. All of the a la carts were good, and everyone in my family seemed to enjoy the buffet most of the time, ate most of our lunches at the snack bar as well. The buffet is not 5 star, but all in all the food was quite good. We will probably be back next year as well, and can honestly say this has been the best tropical vacation we have taken to date!

From the well-stocked bar to the plentiful, delicious buffet to prompt housekeeping to beach activities and gym, the internationally diverse staff was friendly, smiling and enthusiastic, like they were genuinely happy we were there. I feel like we even made friends with some of the staff, who did not seem to be pretending to be friendly or merely performing job duties. We were especially fond of Julian and Hector in the gym, who spoke several languages, made jokes, taught my husband archery, and, as my mother would say, were easy on the eyes. Spike kept us amused with his sense of humor, Gunther made a point to chat with us on the beach, Sandra's beauty captivated our travel companion, and my husband loved the lead dancer of the Madonna show. Speaking of shows, there appeared to be a mix of professional and nonprofessional dance talent onstage, but the nightly shows were colorful and entertaining. The white sand beach was gorgeous and clean. We did experience a bit of chair wars, though, as the chairs filled up early in the day and guests kept their chairs for most of the day. We felt safe and could tell the staff also kept an eye on security as well as who comes and goes from the resort. I noticed staff politely but firmly taking plates of food away from people who must have wandered in from somewhere else, as they did not have wrist bands. The beach towel people maintained a strict policy of \"no towel card, no towel.\" If you don't return your towel card at the end of your stay, they will charge you $20 per lost card. The shopping district in town is 2 miles away. We could borrow bicycles at no charge or take a $5.00 cab ride to get there. We watched American football at the tavern on 4th and 10th, and came back a second time to do some shopping, explore the bars and do photos. We especially enjoyed Senior Frogs on the beach. It cost $85.00 for some nachos, guac and a couple rounds of drinks, but the staff went out of their way to make it a really fun experience, more about entertainment than just food and drinks. Room for improvement would include the fact that the rooms were adequate, not plush, but we had what we needed. Right outside our room (1373) was some sort of generator or something that was quite noisy. We didn't spend much time in the room so we didn't care. But light sleepers may not appreciate it. Also, I hate to say it, but there were little bugs in my bed. Housekeeping did come and change the sheets and spray them, but then my bed smelled like bug spray that made me abandon that bed altogether and use the second bed in the room, much to my husband's dismay, as he was enjoying his own bed and didn't want to trade with me. I understand we are in a tropical environment, so bugs are inevitable, but the ones in my bed creeped me out. Next time I would ask for a different room altogether. On a positive note, they let us eat and drink after we had checked out and were waiting for the cab cab to the airport.

Good aircon, great shower - very comfortable. Staff are a bit noisy in the halls. The buffet has good food. The atmosphere is a bit cafeteria-like and traffic flow around the food stations is a bit chaotic, but we always found good food.

You can get a Cab for USD 90, a Collectivo (a mini van shuttle) for USD 30 per person or a bus to Playa Del Carmen for USD 10 per person (or 110 Pesos). We took the bus and got a taxi from the bus station that took USD 5 (or 50 pesos) to take us to the hotel. Check in was a breeze. When we got to our room we got 2 double beds and we had a connecting door to the adjacent room that would not lock. We called the reception and they sent someone in 15-20 mins who locked the door for us. We requested a room change as we could hear the people in the next room very clearly. We were told we could change the room the next day once they had a supervisor. We changed our room the next day morning. We were given keys to 2 different rooms and we could check them out before we decided which one we wanted to stay in. We got a great room with ocean view and a nice king bed. We though the transfer was nicely done and the staff was very cooperative. The rooms are not extremely well decorated. They have plain colors. The walls are not very thick, and you can hear the housekeeping staff in the hallway once they get there in the morning. The staff is excellent. They were very friendly and always willing to help.

They have something going on all the time. Only you have to pay for internet. They have a business center and wireless but you have to pay for the time you use. Overall it was a great resort.

Best things at the buffet: made to order omelets, homemade donuts, fresh cheeses, and BBQ ribs (& some of the desserts, but I have no idea what they were called). We also ate at two restaurants onsite (Don Diego - Mexican and the Italian one - Miramere or something like that). Both were excellent service and food (I thought the Mexican one was better, but my husband said that he had the best lasagna EVER at the Italian restaurant). The other resturant was closed while we were there. All of the drinks at the two main bars were excellent - not watered down at all - and the staff was super friendly.

We also ate at the Italian restaurant at the sister resort Viva Wyndham Azteca (excellent main dishes (filet mignon & salmon/grouper), but surprisingly the pasta dishes were lacking in flavor), and at their buffet once. Their buffet did seem a little more upscale (more seafood, etc) than the Maya's. We especially like the pizza at the Azteca's snack bar - very crispy! We watched a few of the shows that the staff put on each night - very well done! Mexican costumes & dances one night, Full Moon - a medley of \"spooky\" songs & some amazing acrobatics, and Stars - impersonators. If you wanted to participate, they had tons of activities constantly, but they didn't bug people if they weren't interested. We were assigned room # 3219. It was on the 2nd floor of the furthest building (a little disappointing since I had asked for a ground floor/patio room closer to the beach). We were told this is where they put RCI members. Our room overlooked the small adult pool and had a very small balcony (useless except for hanging wet towels/clothes to dry). However, that and the fact that the shower floor sloped away from the drain so we had a pool of standing water in the corner when we showered, were our only minor complaints. The room was very clean, had a small fridge that they kept stocked w/ bottled water and a couple of sodas, and was a very nice size (king bed). The jacuzzi tub was excellent after a long day of adventure at XPlor! They also provide daily maid service and shampoo/cond./lotion which a lot of timeshares don't give you. Every day but one we had a cute towel animal on our bed when we returned to the room. The grounds were beautifully kept and staff was CONSTANTLY cleaning and making it look nice. We used the free bicycles to ride into Playa (about 10-15 minutes tops) and explore. We also walked from the last bar/restaurant in Playa back to the hotel...that took at least 30 minutes along the beach - we didn't try it on the sidewalks, but I think it would be much longer. Because it was so reasonable, we didn't feel like we were wasting money when we went on excursions for the day and ate elsewhere. We would go back to stay at the Viva Maya anytime - we really enjoyed our stay there!", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Langley City, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood food, great service, beautiful beach.\u201d", "Author": "jad048", "ReviewID": "UR89539706", "Content": "On the positive side: Good food, great service, beautiful beach, lots of daytime activities, good early evening entertainment.

The beach was nice for swimming, no rocks or outcroppings of coral. The resort did have restaurant priviledges at the Viva Azteca and the Italian restaurant there was very good. Breakfast at the resort was also quite good. The nightly shows were quite entertaining. Now the negatives. No free WiFi, you had to pay to use a computer or to use WiFI. The drinks were not made with any top shelf brands and were very weak. The Jacuzzi's were not hot at all. The gym did not feature air conditioning which made it difficult for me to breathe in while working out. The beach was extremely crowded as well as the enitre resort area. The beach lounge chairs were packed in like sardines and this made it difficult to walk around them. We had trouble getting soap, wash cloths, hand towels, etc in our room. The units were quite small compared to others resorts I have been to in Mexico. The room has a musty odor to it and felt clammy with the air conditionier on.

We are frequent travellers and have stayed in Mexico and Playa many times. We were looking for a quick cheap getaway. We were very impressed and my expectations were exceeded. Keep in mind it is older resort. Not all the bells and whistles some of the newer resorts have but really-when you are in Mexico do you need a 700 sq ft room? Food was excellent-not steak and lobster but the buffet and a la cartes were top notch-Activities-show every night, disco, bikes, rock wall, archery, hobie cats, kayaks, windsurfers, boogie boards etc all included in the price. Oh and don't forget the circus-they even had a trapeze setup for guests to try-outstanding fun. There are also fully equipped spa and scuba centres on site but we not use either. The staff are all cheerful and appear to enjoy working for Wyndham. My wife especially liked Dodo who ran the water arobics daily. All the staff made effort to get you involved, but never pushy-just right. Another benefit was that as guest you also got to use sister resort Azteca 3 resorts up the beach-no problem at all. Also with all the (drug cartel) fear it was nice to be in the Playacar gated subdivision which gave you an added sense of security-but only a 10 minute walk into Playa del Carmen. The location is also on a very nice section of beach-great for swimming and water sports-many places in Cancun/Riviera Maya have rocky or just lousy beaches, but not Wyndham. Folks it is not 5 star-you had to get your own drinks at bar etc, but for the money, I would highly recommend and return anytime.

Bearing in mind that this is a 3* hotel (thats what it said where I booked it from) and I was more than impressed. Rooms were clean, modern and spacious. They had the normal amenities such as an iron, ironing boarding and hairdryer etc. It also had a fridge but I never did seem to receive the water from the cleaner but I wasn\u2019t too bothered as the water in the onsite shop was relatively cheap and you could refill the bottles up at the numerous bars and restaurants. The food I found was excellent of that compared to other hotels I have stayed at. It was of good quality and plentiful. There was always lot of variety and I would of thought even the fussiest of eaters would cope. Pool area was nice, but then again the hotel was only half full when I was there, so never had a problem finding a spare sun bed, although you still would get a select few people every day saving the sunbeds so they could have the \u2018spot\u2019 they wanted. Even though there were signs stating that this wasn\u2019t allowed! But I blame the hotel for letting this happen. The beach was absolutely gorgeous! Powder white sand and crystal clear sea, such a beautiful scene to see everyday. The only downfall was people leaving their fag ends in the sand, which I found disgusting and disrespectful; there were plenty of ashtrays and bins around so there was no need for it. I only went to one of the A la carte restaurants (Mexican) it was very nice and tasty and service was superb. I never had problem booking the restaurant. I did not go to all of them as we ate out a few times but out of choice not because the quality of food on offer. But again the hotel was only half full. I never went to any shows during my stay but the feedback I received from other people was that they were really good. The bars have a variety of cocktails and drinks available.

Let me just say that I read quite a few reviews about this hotel before and after I booked. Reading the reviews really prepared me on what to expect as well as giving me some insider tips (like which rooms are the best). Now, let's break it down: Arrival: When we arrived at 2pm I wasn't expecting to check in since check in isn't until 3pm. To my surprise, our room was ready. We checked in and the agent gave us our keys, however, as soon as I saw that our room number was an odd number, I immediatley requested an even numbered room. Why you might ask? The odd numbered rooms face the outside of the property. No view and you have to listen to the neighboring properties' clanking dishes from the kitchens all day. So, we were assigned to 1110, but is wasn't quite ready yet. We had to wait a couple of hours for it, but I am soooo glad we did! Our room was only the fifth room away from the ocean. Out our door we had a perfect view of the ocean and we we were close to the pool and bar. Rooms: As I mentioned earlier, our room had a great view! King size bed was comfortable enough (better than other Mexican resorts that I have been to). The pillows were amazing! I know this may sound silly, but pillows are very important to me and these were just awesome! The bathroom was nice and updated, hot water was great! We had a fridge in the room that was nice, safety deposit box, iron, ironing board, hair dryer..the basics. The room was nice and clean. I really looked forward to the towel animals each day. No complaints at all! Food: I thought the food was great. It's not 4 star dining service, it's a buffet. I never had a problem finding something to eat. The homemade donuts every morning were exceptional! I ate quite a few! We ate at the Viva Maya's buffet every day as well as the Azteca's. Since it is the Maya's sister property, you are allowed to eat/drink at their buffet/bar. If we weren't happy with the selection at the Maya's buffet, we would walk right over to the Azteca to check out what they had. Lot's of options! In addition, we were allowed to eat at the a la cartes 3 times. We ate at Il Palco (Azteca) twice and Miramare (Maya) once. Miramare was not that great, however, we LOVED Il Palco. It was very good! Property: The property itself was amazing! The employees are ALWAYS cleaning the grounds. Great beach! Plenty of chairs. The pool was nice too. It was more lively than the pool at the Azteca. If you want a relaxing pool then go to the Azteca. The bars were great. I'm not a big drinker but the drinks seemed just fine to me. There are shows every night on the stage. They are ok...a little cheesy but fun to watch. Activities: Kayaking, sailing, snorkeling, water aerobics, salsa dancing, spanish lessons, bingo, archery, ceramics (does cost $), volleyball, bicycling and rock climbing. PLENTY to do. Overall, this property was great! I liked the fact that we basically were at two resorts. Having access to the Azteca was really nice. We went over there several times during our stay. It's a quick 10 minutes walk or two minute bike ride. It was also nice that there was a little shopping center with a Starbucks no more that a five minute walk down the Maya's driveway. ***Insider tip. Don't pay for internet at the Maya. Starbucks has WiFi for FREE. Just buy a coffee the first day for 26 pesos and keep your receipt. On it there will be a log in and password for their WiFi. You can use this same code throughout your stay. The have a nice patio or couches and chairs inside to relax and surf the net. Recommendations: Do rent the bikes and ride down to Fifth Avenue. Do take a ferry to Cozumel for the day. Do take the colectivo down to Akumal to go snorkeling and see sea turtles for the day. Lastly, I do have one negative thing to say about the property, the ONLY negative thing. The lady at the guest services desk, the desk where you book your a la carte dinners was VERY rude. I thought maybe she was just having a bad day but no, every single day she had an attitude and was very rude. We actually tried to avoid her and only go to the desk when someone besides her was working. She is not doing the property any favors by working with the public. If your in a position to help guests, you should do just that with a smile on your face.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cif you're a hotel snob, this is not the place for you\u201d", "Author": "worldtraveler2318", "ReviewID": "UR84115134", "Content": "after spending a night in Cancun's Fiesta Americana Aqua hotel, all i can say is that this place was a royal dissapointment. you can tell that the place is not new and the room feels constantly soggy (i felt like i was sleeping on wet sheets all night), the bed is uncomfortable, the food (all-inclusive) is atrocious, the drinks are badly made (if you like good mojitos and margaritas, this is not the place for you) and there are too many loud and obnoxious tourists to make the place relaxing.

Akumal was a little to small and dated but amazing snorkelling and beach. Viva Wyndham Maya fits right in between in my eyes.We really really enjoyed our trip and this hotel. One note the hotel is being renovated which made it a bit noisey but once you were at the beach you didnt notice a thing. I would recomend going to Akumal to snorkel we have done this 3 time and cant wait to do it again. We used the collectivo you see on the hiway, 3 bucks each and you get to ride with the locals very fun and cheap. You will have to walk 30minutes to the hiway to catch the collectivo as you are in a beatiful gated community with beatiful homes and some mayan ruins to look at as you are walking or take a 5 buck cab ride to the hiway then catch the collectivo. I will go back to this hotel with my family in April. I cant wait. Great pizza at the snack bar. Bartenders were great.Maids were awsome.

I went to Akumal snorkeling to see the turtles and the Cenotes as well with the Scuba shop at the hotel. I also did some diving with the scuba shop. AWESOME instructors and staff! Orange short Staff: They are so terrific! They are always working so hard to keep everyone entertained! Get to know them, they are so FANTASTIC!! You will loves this hotel if you like the beach, the pool and the nice people at the hotel. It is a 5 star in my books because of the staff! You can feel very safe at this hotel. Tons of security in the hotel zone and at the hotel itself, there are lifeguards and good security. This hotel really cares about the people who stay there. Thanks again Maya, really had a great week!

We called 2 days before arrival to take advantage of the hotel shuttle, but decided against it when they didnt seem to sure on the process when we called. We didnt want to be standing in the airport waiting forever. We booked our transfer to the hotel thru USA Transfers~ They were INCREDIBLE! They sent very detailed emails confirming how to find them at the airport, etc. Their van was very clean and the driver was so nice. The drive is about an hour to the resort. We arrived at about 1:00pm the ladies at the front desk checked us in and gave us our bracelets and explained our room would be ready between 2:30 and 3:00. We got our welcome drinks and walked around until then. We stayed in room 1203 it had an ocean view. The room wasnt outstanding, but wasnt horrible either. It is kinda plain, but you dont spend to much time in there anyways. We had no problems getting towels, wash cloths, waters, drinks, etc like the previous reviews. We tipped the maid everyday and she always cleaned everything very well and kept us fully stocked. She also left cute towel animals on the bed everyday:) The bathrooms seemed more updated than the rest of the room. We did notice that one whole building was being remodeled so some of the other reviews could of been from very dated rooms that are being upgraded. Pools - both were good not to packed. The \"Relax Pool\" - adult pool was always less packed. One thing we did wish they had was a Hot Tub! The Hot Tubs they had were the same temp as the pools. Food- I agree with the others you should book your reservations when you check in. They said they fill up fast although we did find it a bit weird that when we were in the restaurants there were at the most only 4 other couples??? We were very bummed that the MEXICAN restaurant was closed for remodeling (we never saw any work going on in there though) So we booked at the Italian and the Mediterranian. We preferred the Mediterranian one they had more of a variety. They have fish, chicken, steak, pasta, etc! Very good!! The Buffet- lets see.. we loved it the first night after that it got very old eating the same stuff over and over. Didnt really seem to be much mexican food. Alot of pasta, pizza, burgers, hotdogs, etc. Breakfast got very old- same stuff every day. We did venture out for Lunch twice to Carboncitos (corner of 5th Ave and 4th Ave) Very good! Worth the visit - great tacos, burritos, etc Shopping- 5th Ave TONS of shops quick $5 taxi ride down EXCURSIONS~ We talked with the lady at the desk in the resort and looked at a couple and found one that we wanted to do that would of ran us $145 each. We decided to think on it and thank goodness we did bc we noticed on the beach that 2 guys were walking the beach selling excursions. At first we didnt trust them, but talked with another couple that had just booked thru them and had a great time. So we booked a trip to Isla Mujeres for $75 each!! This included an all day trip -- They picked us up at 8 and drove us to Cancun where we hopped on a catamaran and relaxed with unlimited drinks, music, and fun they took us out to their private island where we held a live shark, then they took us out to another area and we snorkeled for about an hour. We then went shopping in Isla Mujeres for about an area-- TONS CHEAPER HERE!! then got back on the catamaran and went and had lunch and relaxed on the beach. Then parasailing on the way back! GREAT TIME!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! We booked it right on the beach thru a shorter guy named Domingo. All and All we had a great time and would probably go back to this resort! The staff was very nice and VERY hard working!! We may go at a different time though- we maybe ran into 4 other couples/ families that spoke english. TONS of Europeans! Lots of Smoking!

My wife and I, and our 5 year-old son. I'm happy to say that we had no real problems or complaints. We arrived in Cancun and took shuttle from Best Day Travel Company. They were very professional and courteous. Upon our arrival we were able to check in even though it was only 12:30 PM. We had a great room, #1104 practically on the beach. #1102 is the closest to the beach and we were right next door. We were a 30 second walk to the pool, beach and bar. I made all 3 dinner reservations that day. Twice to Mexican Restaurant, and once to Mediterranean Restaurant. Food was fine, service was great. I asked for a shot of Tequila at the Mexican Restaurant and the waiter poured it at the table and left me the bottle! There's a digital safe in the room for no extra charge. There's also a fridge stocked with soda, [Pepsi and 7UP], only. I left a tip every day and a note in Spanish requesting beer for the fridge but it never happened. No biggie, I just walked 30 seconds over to the bar, but I've had beer in the fridge at other resorts, so it would've been nice. The pool is kind small for all the people but most were at the beach. Americans are the minority at this resort. Mostly French and Italians who seemed very nice. The beach was beautiful and ocean was clean, I'll post some photos with this review. We took a day trip to Cozumel Island. You can actually see it from the beach. $5.00 taxi ride each way to the ferry pier. $46 US round trip ferry for my wife and I. Our son was free. There was a great band playing music on the 30-minute ferry ride. Once in Cozumel we walked around and looked in the many souvenir shops. The shopkeepers are very pesty and beg you to come into their shop and \"lookie-lookie\". There was a McDonalds and our son wanted to eat there which was fine. The resort's buffet food was very good. I didn't find it that hot in there as other reviewers did. There was plenty of variety and the waiters work very had serving drinks and cleaning up dirty plates and dishes. The only negative thing we found was the high-pressure time-share salesmen. The first day they left a note on our door saying that we had a free gift. I took others advice and ignored them. They called our room every day for the first three days and approached us numerous times in the lobby area. I just kept telling them that I was not interested. It's a shame that you have to be subjected to this on vacation, but like I said that was the only negative part. Internet is available for $5.00 for 30 minutes. Our cell phones worked but at roaming fee of .99 cents a minute. I would return there again. I got a decent price of about $2,700 all-inclusive including round trip out of Providence, RI and shuttle bus to and from Cancun Airport, so I think it was worth it. Had a bad experience coming home on US Airways. We were forced to land in Washington DC/ Dullis because of bad weather in Philadelphia. After 3.5 hours on the tarmac in DC we finally flew into Philadelphia and missed our flight because there was hardly anyone working at 10:30 PM. I guess they all went home because of the bad weather, but 4 international flights arrived at the same time, which was a big mess. We were put up in a \"not so clean\" hotel, [Skyview Towers], in Philadelphia and had to catch a flight the next afternoon. I checked out reviews of the Skyview of Philadelphia and they were dead on. We found employees at Philadelphia Airport to be rude and impatient and will avoid that airport and US Airways in the future.

Then there is the Mediterranean..this was lovely our favourite 1.. and then the Italian above the main bar yet again great food..be aware they rush you through the course's as soon as we had finished one course the next one was on the table, we prefer a wait so keep hold of your spoon and set the pace. We loved the relaxation pool and the main pool and beach were also great..dont have to get up too early to get a good sun bed.. Plenty to do the staff are always on the go and at night they put on a show with a 2 week program so there is something different every night.

No special treatment- I had to fight with the manager to even get a dinner reservation on one night of our trip.

Me and my boyfriend have been out of the country many times before to all-inclusive resorts and we know that things aren't always top notch compared to the US. .so we had that in mind.. We had an easy flight out of Atlanta and into Cancun. No problem being guided to our pre-reserved transportation, and hopping on the van to our hotel. After a quck 40 minute or so ride, we arrived at our hotel. First impression was okay, the street was a secured area and then the hotel entrance was also secured, the main lobby okay....nothing spectacular.....but no problem. Walked up to the front desk, hoping to check in, and the employee never acknoledged us so we spoke to her. She looked up our reservation and handed us our keys to the room, slapped our bracelets on, and gave us our towel cards... stating each time she handed us someting else that it was VERY important not to lose this repeatedly.( If you do lose any....the bracelet is $10 USD, the towel card is $20 and i think to room card was more than that) The lady also said we would need a 100 USD deposit so i put it on my credit card ....no problem,....except when I came to find out that the deposit was for the phone in your room not the hotel deposit. You have to put a $100 deposit to use the phone in your room for local or international calls. That was all that we got...no welcome information or such....The bell boy comes to get our luggage and takes us to our room with a somewhat mini-tour on the way...telling us to walk across the street to buy a phone card because they charge 6-8 dollars per minute( which we do and they will not let you use at the hotel....so we must walk right back across everytime we want to use it...which is a 10 minute walk each way. So much for the 100 dollar deposit huh?). Room was okay. White walls, white bed with three pillows the size of a throw pillow and about an inch thick for the two of us. Bathroom was lovely---remodeled with a glass shower and a nice square sink. Didn't much care what the room looked like because we wouldnt be in it too much....but like a recent review...we were beside RIU's kitchen too---in room 1325. We were so tired by each night that we never seemed to be bothered by it though--just make sure to keep your curtains closed while changing clothes. I don't realize how anyone can think the walls are thin----they are pure concrete....the DOORS however, may make you think its the walls....if ANYONE is in your long hallway you'll hear them. Went to the front desk to let them know our toilet was running constantly our third day, and on our eighth day leaving....nobody ever came. I would reccomend our building but not on the third floor....I'd recommend 1125 or even 1225 but not the top floor. Hard to get to since it was up so many stairs. taxi's are 5 dollars to downtown. And the private entrance road is very safe to go out on. The worst part of the trip came on our last day there.....upon returning from a day trip to Cozumel, we were shocked not to have any messages from our travel group telling us what time to be up front for our ride back to the airport. No problem....we can call them. Calling out of the room was still a joke. Everytime you picked up the phone the operator \"YES, Miss *****, you MUST put your deposit down to make a call from your room\", all while sounding irritated that i picked up my $100 phone, when stating I had payed the deposit, I had to stay on the phone for her to look it up and then she said she would connect me.....Not once was I ever conncected to anyone. So I took the 5 minute hike each time to go use the front desks...which obviously was an inconvenience for them each time. Once the transportation was straightened out two hours later, we decided to go get a few drinks. We had had our pictures taken with the photographers who are at the resort and didn't want the bracelets in the pictures so he said as long as you do not lose them they'll give you new ones. We asked the front desk and they had said that if we kept them with us since it was our last night we'd be fine. We went to the bar to get a drink and he refused to serve us.....even though we had them in our pocket and he had served me without it on 5 minutes before this incidence. Back up to the front desk and they won't put a new one on us......kind of at a losing situation. I'm so irriated by this point I could cry. Our last night in Mexico was spent calling our tour group, fighting with the front desk to make a call, and fighting with the bartender to make a drink. It was ridiculous. Overall this resort was just ok. We knew we had booked a budget resort when we reserved it, and we had that thought in mine. We went with a frame of mind that it will only be as fun as you make it....but the resorts bartenders and front desk staff was rude-which should be the nicest two groups- and it is impossible for all of the crew to be on the same page....which was irritating.... On the GOOD side: 1. the entertainment staff couldn't have been any better---they worked hard, and it showed 2. the Waitstaff everywhere was wonderful as well.....I'm a server and bartender and I have never seen such attentiveness 3. the general area was beautiful 4. the resort had bicycles for free and the road beside the resort is safe and pretty 5. The resort had a nice gym....with a rock wall 6. the resort had archery for free....which was also fun 7. I've had worse all inclusive food.

The desk girl said the view was $25 per person per day more, but the room they had for us had a King size bed. We went to our room, first to be overwhelmed by the musty smell, then a little miffed because there were 2 double beds and no King. We opened the curtians to see the view... we were looking at the back of a tennis court about 15 feet from our balcony with a big blue tarp hung over the fence. It sure didnt feel like the vacation I had spent several months saving for. The next day we asked the desk if we could change rooms, she didnt look very interested in helping us, she looked in a book and told us to come back around 1 pm the next day... Having spent 2 nights in a moldy room I could hardly breath all night, and could barely sleep, it was the morning of our anniversary... I woke up crying (trying to hide it from my husband) he noticed, and suggested we try again for another room. This time there was a guy there and he was very helpfull, he looked up some rooms, gave us a key and told us to see how we liked it... IT WAS PERFECT!! He got a 100 peso tip. The 2nd floor view was of hammocks in the nabour property, King size bed and a fresh smelling room. We were very happy, We spent the night there and went to the Tullum/xelha tour the next day.

I watched the cook fry a peice of salmon untill it was inedible, its the first time I have ever seen a weiner pizza, made from the hotdogs from the day before, the breakfast sausage looked like mini hockey pucks. The Mexican alacart resturant (Don Hasienda) was excellant, 1st class service and food. Make sure you make reservations as soon as you get there.

Because we have connections at the hotel, we were able to get a 50% discount and so paid $100 night for two people at this exclusively all-inclusive hotel. I will go into details on the specific areas of the hotel below, but overall our only bad experience happened on the very last night of our stay... Having arrived back at the hotel at around 11:00 pm, we promptly called the 24-hour front desk reception to request a 3:15am wake-up call. This would give us enough time to take a quick shower and get our bags together in time to catch a 4am taxi to the Cancun Airport for our 6am flight. My boyfriend made the request over the phone to the front desk, and I was sitting right next to him when he did it...close enough to hear the voice on the other end of the line (this will be important later...) Because I am overly-cautious and a worry wart, I also set my cell phone alarm clock for 3:45, JUST IN CASE we fell back asleep after our wake up call. Sure enough, at 3:45am my cell phone went off and I barely had enough time to rinse off in the shower before we had to go down to the lobby to get a taxi. The worst part of this whole situation happened next... When we asked the man staffing the front desk (Manuel, young short man with braces) what happened with our wake-up call, he claimed that he had been working at the desk all night and that we had made no such call. Well, at first, he asked us if we had called at 11:30pm (which is about when we called) and if we had requested a wake-up call for 12:30am. He repeated himself, asking why we had requested a wake-up call for only an hour later. We told him this had not happened, and even if we had, why hadn't we recieved the 12:30 wake up call then? After this, he played dumb and started explaining that we had never called at all and basically calling us liars. At one point he even laughed at us. I was so livid, and this one experience really left a bad taste in our mouths after a wonderful vacation. As soon as we got back to the United States, I called the hotel to speak with a manager and she was very, very apologetic about the whole affair. She confirmed using hotel records that we had actually called for the wake-up call and told us that whatever she could do to rememdy the situation, she would. We asked that if we ever return to Viva Maya we be given a special rate and she said of course. Other than this, here are some details on the positive aspects of our stay: Room: Two double beds, a nice warm shower, TV with many channels in English and Spanish. Nothing too fancy, but definately comfortable. Food: There is always food 24 hours a day, whether at the buffet, the snack bar, or the restaurants. The buffet food is good, but definitely not gourmet, and you will see some of the same items every day...Although they do change up the theme a bit. Staff: All very friendly. Special thanks to Lucia, who helped us with our excursions and did a fabulous job planning for us. Beach: Lovely, with a calm swimming area. Shows: Always very fun and entertaining.", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barnegat, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cA Tale of Two \"Resorts\"\u201d", "Author": "Madame44", "ReviewID": "UR73121383", "Content": "You will understand my chosen title at the end of our trip/review! We arrived at the VWM on July 22 and departed on the 29th. We used Bookit.com for our reservations. One thing that I did not know that may help others--once you choose seats on a site like Bookit.com, you MUST contact the airline directly to confirm your choice of seats. I did not know this prior to this trip. Ok--onto VWM: We are a family of 5: ages 47, 46, 16, 14 and 9 years old. Our check in was uneventful--very smooth. No one was rude or impolite. In fact, they were quite pleasant! I do speak Spanish, so maybe that makes a difference. We had a welcome cocktail but since we arrrived at 1, our rooms were not ready--check in is at 3pm. They gave us bracelets, we ate lunch, changed and went to the beach. THE BEACH---as with other reviews, I completely agree--the beach is spectacular. There were rough seas (red & yellow flag days), several times throughout our stay, so at times, the first 30 feet of surf was churned with sand. I would not call it \"brown\" as a previous poster did. It was simply churned up sand. Yes, there were jellyfish that must be very small--both my 14 year old and my husband were stung by something unseen. Otherwise, the beach is beautiful. There is a sign that you should \"not reserve the palapas\". However, everyone ignores that sign and people were up reserving them as early as 6:30 am--I am an early riser, so I saw them! The ROOMS After check in, we went to our rooms--I had paid for two \"Garden View\" rooms. In June, I had emailed the VWM to request adjoining rooms. They said that they would do their best to accommodate our request. When we got into our rooms (1220 & 1222), not only were they adjoining rooms, but we could see the beach from them! The view was great!! The rooms were not very decorated, but they were VERY clean and spacious. No armoires, but there were several drawers and a closet. We DID have clocks, safes and refrigerators in BOTH rooms. One room did have the 'toilet issue'--whoever measured for the toilet/vanity installation should need to review his basic math, because there was definitely an error in measurment---the vanity top was too deep, so the toilet(which is installed under the vanity), does not have enough clearance for the lid to stay up. We had some athletic tape with us, so we taped the toilet lid to the vanity & it stayed up!!! FYI: rooms in the 1200 section where we were: the EVEN numbered rooms face the courtyard area with the trapeze, the stage, the snack bar & the beach. The ODD numbered rooms face the neighboring resort & a chain link fence. So, we were thrilled with our rooms. Yes, we did hear the shows at night, but they end by 10:30, so we had no problem sleeping. We did NOT hear noise from other rooms or people in the hallway. We did leave tips for our maid on a daily basis. I left her $2 or $3 per room plus some American candies and gum. A small price to pay for the hard work that they do. Our room was cleaned very promptly. She left us extra towels and toilet paper. She left extra drinks for us. I did leave her a note once or twice, in Spanish, requesting what we needed. Our requests were always taken care of. The beds were comfortable, but we like a firm bed. The SHOWS--these were a HUGE disappointment. They were lip-synched. Truly a let down. Having stayed at other all-inclusives, I know the potential for a decent, entertaining show simply by using the local customs and dances. I did not need to watch a person lip-synch Madonna songs!!! We did try to watch the show 5 of the 7 nights we were there. We never made it through the entire show. This needs improvement! Maybe if they did a Mayan dance--or acted out a Mayan ceremony--or history---something!!!! But certainly not Madonna, or a butchered Moulin Rouge! The POOL: The pool is too small for the number of people using it. My 16 year old son and my husband tried the swim-up bar on one occasion, but they decided that the water was too warm & they never went back. That was the only time we used the pool. The ACTIVITIES: We did not use the kids club, but we did see where it was. We used the kayaks--very pleasant & easy to reserve. The animation crew that circulates in order to motivate people to join the events, do work hard. I certainly understand their job--they need to get people involved. By the same token, if I politely decline an activity, I really do NOT want to be pestered any further! On multiple occasions, we were questioned as to WHY we did not want to do the Merengue Dance Lessons! After a few days, we started to pretend that we were sleeping every time we heard them shouting \"YOGA!!! YOGA\" or \"Salsa! Dance Lessons!\" People did do the lessons, we saw them & they certainly seemed to enjoy themselves. We just wanted to relax. The FOOD: I agree with many of the previous posters. The food itself was NOT BAD. We were always able to find something good to eat. HOWEVER...the buffet restaurant (La Terraza), was unpleasant for us. The lack of air conditioning in there makes eating unpleasant! In addition to that, the heat and humidity will cause mold to grow on breads. We did find green sections on hot-dog rolls and a pastry on two separate occasions. I am pretty tolerant of heat, but once you add in the fact that there are ovens and stoves and heat lamps to keep food warm, plus a hundred or so people in the same place...it is NOT pleasant. Not all of the windows open either! It was too hot. Also, the layout of the food area was not well thought out. In order to get food, we were constantly dodging people! The pizza, nachos, burgers, hotdogs etc by the pool/beach area were very good. Although there are no coffee makers in the rooms, I got THE most wonderful cappuccinos every morning at the snack bar by the pool and at the coffee bar by the main lobby while I took my walk each day. Delicious!! We did eat at the Mexican restaurant (Don Diego) and the Mediterranean (Portofino). Both meals were excellent and pleasant. Air conditioned, great service and delicious food. We immensely enjoyed those meals. Making reservations at the desk must be done several days in advance. And NO, they do not FILL all the tables in the restaurants. I did not have a problem with that because the service for those who were there was GREAT. Although we did not use it, apparently there are deli sandwiches available at the snack bar by the pool between 11pm and 6am according to the posted sign. I'm sure people coming from the disco would be interested in that. The GROUNDS--the grounds were gorgeous. I loved the covered walkways, the sunken \"maya\" area with statues, lizards and agoutis. The flowers, lawns and plants were beautifully manicured. This was so very pleasant to walk each day. TOURS: We did not use the tours offered by the agencies in the hotel. They were outrageously expensive ( almost $500 for 2 hours of ATV rides for our family!!!) We went to a booth in the shopping area across the street from the resort where we purchased two tours. We did 3 hours of ATVs with caves and a cenote AND a tour to Coba with zip lines, canoes, jungle trek, lunch and a cenote. These two tours cost us as much as ONE tour would have cost us through the hotel agencies(about $600USD). The tours were wonderful. Going HOME...our flight was not until 7:00pm. The hotel did allow us to check out at 1pm instead of the usual 12:00 noon. Our rooms (1220 & 1222) were going to be in use again as soon as we checked out. Upon leaving our room, they allowed us to use a \"hospitality room\" (un-booked room), to shower in. When we went to this room, we then realized what the other posters were complaining about. That room (3114) in the section furthest from the beach, was so different from the rooms we had just left. If we had gotten that room, I would have been (pardon the expression), PISSED!!!! It was still clean, but there was a tub with grungy caulk around it, the beds were VERY hard, and the view....it was of the resort next door--chain link fence and all. So NOW I see the 'other side' of the room issue! We lucked out. If I were going back to the Riviera Maya area, I would NOT stay here again simply because of the buffet situation. We stayed at the Sandos Gala Playacar resort (just down the beach from the VWM), four years ago and it was MUCH more pleasant in the buffet and restaurants. The grounds at VWM were better though. We did have a wonderful vacation,and memories to last a lifetime. It is a fine resort with a few 'issues' that need adjusting.

We were a little taken back but, went with it as they assured us the Azteca was a nicer resort and that we could still use the Maya resort as well. When we went to the Azteca, we soon discovered that it is nothing like the Maya. It was very old and looks like a budget hotel on the beach. The \"ocean View\" room we were promised was a sliver of ocean if you bent over the balcony, otherwise it was a rooftop view. There were very few people there and mostly elderly. We immediately went back to the Maya and demanded that we have the room we reserved. They accomodated us and while our room was ok, first floor and close to the pool, it was VERY noisy next to the entertainment stage and trapeze. When we went to the concierge to make dinner reservations at one of their 3 resturants, we were told we could only make one because they were really booked up. We ended up at the Italian resturant, it was only half full. The food was marginal and pretty blan. The next morning we tried the breakfast buffet, TERRIBLE! There was very little choice of food and since we got there on the later side, not much was left. Bugs were flying around the fruit and the food was awefull. When we checked in with the concierge to make another dinner reservation, he told us we could only make one per trip! Ive never heard of such a thing! Since we had such a bad breakfast we werent about to try the dinner buffet. We ate a little at the lunch buffet which consisted of Hambergers, hot dogs and pizza. The same thing every day. We all ended up nauseous throughout our stay. We ate out in town on the last night. As far as the pool, super noisy a lot of activities going on, go to the adult pool for quite. The beach although beautiful, the water is brown, not the pretty turqouise you see at other resorts. also beware of jellyfish, we got stung a few times, the ocean is full of them and because the water is so mucky, you cant see them.

It was our first trip to Playa Del Carmen & our first AI. Overall the hotel was a good value for the money. The check in staff were not at all helpful as reported in many reviews. We wanted to upgrade from 1 room to 2 adjoining rooms. After 3 days of trying and getting the run around, we just gave up. I had better things to do on vacation than hang out at the check in desk. We booked our a la cartes immediately upon check in and got a reservation at each of the 3 onsite restaurants, without any problems at all. We loved the Mexican & Italian the best. Our room was very clean and the beds weren't as hard as I was expecting from the reviews. We all slept fine. The cleaning staff left us more than enough towels - I requested more the first day and was set up for the rest of the week, bath mat included. We stayed in Rm.1353 which faced a Riu resort but did have a micro view of the ocean. The large glass enclosed shower was awesome and we did have a fridge (unstocked) in our room. The air conditioning worked great. Every time we used the 'Please make up this room' sign on the door, it was finished within the hour. The grounds are beautiful, well kept and we enjoyed the different wildlife wandering around. The beach was fabulous!! We never had a problem finding chairs or a palapa. The food at the beach snack shop was good. Loved the wood fired pizza! The main buffet was just ok but we're anti-buffet so take that how you will. Breakfast was the best meal there. We could always find something to eat that we liked. It was always way too hot in there but the staff was entertaining. We never had any complaints about watered down drinks & were served top shelf liquor on request. In fact many times we asked them to ease up on the heavy hand a bit, lol. The close proximity to Playa was fantastic. We took a quick $5 cab ride into town a bunch of times to shop, sightsee & get away from the buffet food. There is a small shopping area right across the street from the resort. Great for a quick booze run, snacks, water or souveniers. There's a Starbucks too. We made use of the boogie boards, took spanish lessons, shopped at the craft market they set up in the main lobby area one evening & took advantage of having the beach completely to ourselves many nights after dark. All of the staff (except check in desk, of course) were very friendly & helpful. We did a day trip to Hidden Worlds for ziplines & snorkelling. I highly reccommend it! It was beautiful, fun & there were no crowds to fight. We also went on a deep sea fishing charter with Capt Rick's in Puerto Aventuras. We booked this resort because of the kids. We figured AI was the best option since the food & drink portion of our family vacactions always costs the most. This resort also received great reviews on activities for teens.

Upon check-in, we were greeted by the surly and unwelcoming staff at the front desk. We were not offered any sort of welcome, overview, or list of activities, let alone a cocktail. Our three 'garden view' rooms were instead a view of the RIU Playacar\u2019s kitchen, complete with clanging dishes, kitchen smells, and employee chatter at all hours of the day and early morning. The beds were hard as bricks. The rooms contained no refrigerators, hand towels, washcloths, bath mats, alarm clocks, or Mexican charm. The \u2018colonial-inspired decorative accents\u2019 means there is a colorful picture on one of the white, sterile, and unwelcoming walls. No other attempt to decorate could be found. Incidentally, I don\u2019t know where the picture of the lobby came from on the website, but it didn\u2019t come from the Wyndham Maya. Two of our original three rooms had lovely remodeled bathrooms with great tile, top-mounted sinks, glass shower doors and contemporary fixtures. But through some bad planning, the toilet lids were too tall to fit under the counter, so they leaned against your back as you sat. The third room had fixed this problem by slicing off the lid, but not quite short enough and the lid was permanently stuck under the counter. The lights in two of those rooms flickered all night and one of the toilets ran constantly. It was finally repaired on day three. We requested a room move after three days and were granted it by one of the very few people at Wyndham Maya trained in customer satisfaction, Elisa, at the front desk. Our new rooms had an actual garden view, but still few amenities as promised. Of the 6 rooms we had during our stay, one didn't get cleaned one day, 5 never had bath mats, twice we were left without towels. The one room with a bath mat had those privileges revoked on the last day when it was instead replaced with two washcloths. Room amenities became a running joke. We called housekeeping or front desk about all our problems. Sometimes they were on top of it, most times they were not. The included snorkeling is really just snorkel equipment. To snorkel, you have to pay $30 pp. The '620-seat theater' is really an open-air stage with 620 plastic lawn chairs. There were no \u2018Theme Parties\u2019. Dance classes consisted of the entertainment staff pulling guests onto the pool deck or stage. The classes were fun, but again slightly misrepresented on the website. If there was a \u2018gymnasium\u2019 it is merely a play on words. There was a workout center, or \u2018gym\u2019 short on equipment to say the least. The rock climbing wall was a wall about 6 feet wide and 10 feet tall with maybe two dozen holds in place. It was inside the gym. It took us three days to find the spa. Making reservations for dinner was next to impossible. And though the website says: 'In addition, guests can enjoy at the sister property Viva Wyndham Azteca, \"Il Palco\", Italian restaurant a la carte, and \"Bambu\" Oriental restaurant a la carte open for dinner, (reservations required, limited space).\"Full Bar\" Service and Snacks 24 hours a day.' \u2026this proved to be untrue. We were told we could 'walk around and look, but not eat, drink, or swim' at Azteca. We tried to make reservations for the restaurants but could only be accommodated after 9:30pm and only if we made reservations the same day. At 8am when the desk opened, there were already 15 people in line and the \u2018all reservations are full\u2019 sign went up by 8:05. We were unable to get reservations at the restaurant over the pool even when making reservations on the second day of a 7-day stay, but got into the last two for the last two nights of our stay. The tour desk only knew details of select excursions and seemed unwilling to investigate others (can you say commission?). We secured a tour through the operators on the beach and had a fantastic \u00bd day trip to the jungle with Discovery Jungle Tours. We were approached about joining the VIP club and made it clear that even a free stay wouldn\u2019t be worth our time. We heard several other guests commenting about the lack of amenities in the rooms or other similar issues with the resort. On the plus side, the entertainment staff worked hard and was enthusiastic about making people happy. The shows were a little hokey, but still entertaining. The Disney show involved many guests, most of them little ones from the kids club. That made the show extra fun for everyone. The food was good, fruit was fresh, plenty of food to go around, and no shortage of variety. The two restaurants at Maya that we were able to get to were nice and the food was good there. Bar service was great throughout the resort and all the small kids seemed to be having a great time at the organized kid\u2019s club events. While we had fun as a family, none of that fun can be attributed to the Wyndham Maya, except to say we had fun in spite of the resort. It was a huge disappointment.

There are water sports (most free), archery, a really good gym, volleyball, darts, bikes etc...Needless to say, anyone we gets bored here must be a boring person?

There was hardly any accessible coffee anywhere at all. In the morning you had to walk to the beach bar to get a very small and terrible tasting cup. So..if you are a coffee drinking be warned.

We agree with other posters - the Wyndham Azteca is the quite option. We walked up there one day for lunch and there was no where near the level of activities happening compared to the Maya. So...for our teens...the Maya wins hands down. Here's a few comments: Rooms were clean. Cleaning staff was always helpful and gave me what I asked for (written in Spanish). There ARE hand towels in the bathrooms contrary to previous posts. They also had nice Bath & Body lotions in the bathroom. Good water pressure - rooms are boring, but are functional! We were in rm 1127 in the renovated section near the trapeze...loved our location. Food is good and plentiful. We had no problems getting our maximum 3 reservations at the ala carte restaurants. We liked them all and the service was exceptional at those restaurants. Food is not 5 star, but the quality was still good and I loved the breakfast each morning. My husband had a hot fried donut each morning and ice cream each night...he was happy too! The kids ate all day and loved the non stop drinks. They got upset stomaches the first day because they were chugging drinks so quickly! Our 15 y/o was offered alcohol the first day with her pina colada when she ordered at the pool bar. Even in the ala carte restaurant with my dh and I sitting there - our 15 y/o ordered a mixed drink and they asked if she wanted alcohol in it!!!!! Maybe other parents are more lenient, but there is no way she should be getting served imho. The beach area was pretty and had tons of sea shells. They had fabulous circular day beds that my dh and I lounged on each day. We never reserved any chairs...didn't need to. The lifeguards are there for looks only -imho. BE CAREFUL IF YOU HAVE SMALL CHILDREN...there is no way I would believe that the lifeguards are doing their job...if you want a comfort feeling that your kids are safe in the water...watch them yourself. I saw the lifeguards with their back to the water...for extended periods of time. My kids and dh went in the water on red flag...and were totally fine, but I would not have been easy going if my kids were younger. We took the taxi to shop in PDC. We also borrowed the bikes on 3 different occassions and rode into 5th ave in PDC. Definitely an easy ride along the great bike paths that are marked going into town. We actually rode the bike path - the whole big stretch of 5th ave...going parallel with 5th ave, but not on the busy pedestrian walkway...but a street over (hope this makes sense!). We locked our bikes up and spent an afternoon shopping...very easy. REMEMBER...count your change...on 2 different occassions we realized we could have been shortchanged around US$10 just due to our carelessness while shopping or even when paying for our tix at C. Itza. We borrowed the hotels boogie boards and kayaks. We participated in lots of activities - water polo, beach volleyball, aqua aerobics, step aerobics...I never thought the activity staff was pushy...just very hardworking. We used the fitness center (way too hot even early in the morning) and archery area too. Our kids did the parasailing for $60 pp. I had to pay $10 just to be driven out on the boat to photograph/video them...rip off, but I wanted to be on the boat. The experience was supposed to be 17 minutes long per the Caribe salesperson. I video'd the kids - it was 10 minutes flying...what I call a ripoff...again, but the kids had never done it before and it was fun and looked safe from my vantage point on the boat. We also borrowed snorkeling gear from them...very poor conditions probably year round...not much to see. Overall, we wouldn't stay there again because there are so many other hotels to choose from, but the value was there. I booked the hotel directly from Wyndham. Cost was $164 night for hotel (no air incl). We have stayed at much nicer hotels, but for the money this was perfect. We wanted to do various excursions and so I was happy to stay at a value priced hotel so I wouldn't feel bad about spending $500 on a days worth of excursions. Our teens loved the vacation and had a great time at the Maya. The 2 big excursions we did - we went to C. Itza with Carlos Diaz...I did write a review for this. The total cost for the day was probably around $500-worth it -imho. We also went to Selvatica and did the ziplines and segways...cost was approx. $500 for that day...again...totally worth it.

We went every year multiple times and even bought time share. In 2005, we took a break and began to try new resorts- some good and better and some awful. Some of the resorts included: Barcelo Maya Beach, Blue Bay Grand Esmeralda, Puerto Adventuras, Sandos Coracol, RIU Playacar. These resorts are all on the same price range that we got for Viva Maya. Because the time share has not been used in so long, my boyfriend and I decided to use it and return to a place we enjoyed staying at. Because we went through the time share, we were considered VIP. At the airport, we were greeted by our transfers, but still had to pay $65.00. Before, we never had to pay anything. We also had to pay this on our way back. Our room was a suite, so it was beautiful! We didn't spend much time in the room but it was nice when we were in there. We were on the second floor and our balcony overlooked the adult pool. I would of perfered a room overlooking the ocean and that was not so far away from everything. The entertainment staff was fun and always had activities to do. We really enjoyed Raul and Alejandro. The nightly shows- some got better and some got worse. I don't understand why they are so far behind modern times and still dancing to Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears. The food was our main disappointment. Besides the pizza at the snackbar at lunch, the food was awful. In my opinion, the resort got cheap! We had good weather, even being concerned about the hurricane. It was not as hot at we thought it would be and it only rained one day. The day it rained it poured nonstop. We tried the italian restruant and the Bamboo at the Azteca. Both were a good change from the buffet food, and the Bamboo was air conditioned! The pool was overcrowded and outdated. It is really small compaired to other resorts and needs fixed up. The beach was beautiful though and that is why we went! We always got a hut and set up for the day in a great spot! It was a little rocky, but no big deal for us. Excursions- We tried Isla Mujeres and bought it through Domingo on the beach. DO NOT BUY thought him!! Lucklly we had a nice day, but what we paid for we never did. It took too long to get there and was not worth the money. He really talked this trip up! Other people with us had an awful day so just beware you are not getting what you pay for. Coco Bongos- AWESOME! We had a blast and would do it again everytime we go back! Overall, this resort has gone downhill and is outdated. We will go back to the Barcelo Maya Caribe/Beach for sure! If we go through the time share with Viva again, it will be to the Azteca or to another location. We still had a great vacation and got what we paid for!", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen, South Dakota", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you paid for! Resort 3 stars, Beach 5 stars.\u201d", "Author": "Robert57401", "ReviewID": "UR69967201", "Content": "I tried to give these resort 2 stars but over-all as a family we gave it 3 stars with a long list of CONS. The size of the beach area and employee staff, and good AC in our room with a nice flat screen TV forced us to give the place 3 stars. Pros: Vastly improved beach area all up and down that part of Playa Del Carmen which creates much more room in front of the resort. Staff does a good job for the most part in all areas of the resort. The front desk job is a tough job! Can you imagine talking to guests from all over the globe, who may speak 5 different languages than you for a 10 hours shift per day? Room quality is pretty fair. The property is a bit dated! Our Room quality was not perfect but very adequate. The A/C in our room was great the digital thermometer worked very well. You could be a cool as we wanted to be or could easily turn up the temperature. The entire property has many flaws in the architecture aspect versus what really works and is practical. The distance from the front of the resort to the beach is a short walk. So don't worry about that aspect of this property. Maybe 100 yards tops if your room was closet to the front of the hotel. The hotel has a very large tiled sitting area that gets used in the evenings. A Martini bar is up front that also made fantastic Cappuccino\u2019s and other coffee drinks. Cons: The main dining area for all guests was never below 85 degrees when we ate there,, no matter if it was 8:00 in the morning, lunch time or 8:00 at night! They had large windows open but it was too flippin hot! The food is located in the center of the room where the ceiling area is only 9 feet tall. This makes the food serving area even more hot then the seating area. The way the food serving tables are arranged forces people to reach around you or through you all the time because you cannot see everything or you forget something and are forced to reach around someone. The eating experience was very poor in our all-inclusive resort experience..!!! YUK...in fact 2 of us had the skirts after eating lunch the first day which lasted about 12 hours. Bar drinks...this place served the most watered down drinks I have ever had! I offered the bartender $10 to give me a small sample of his (WELL) tequila. He said he could not do so... and then turned to some other tequila behind on a pedestal counter for my $10. That should give you a clue. BUT ..we should all understand that if you had 600 pool guests having margarita\u2019s with a real ounce and a half of regular tequila or full strength rum, bourbon or scotch... that after 3 or 4 drinks... the resort would have guests falling on themselves or getting into fights around the pool. All inclusive resorts are a beer drinker\u2019s paradise..at best in most cases.!! The two pools by the beach area are somewhat under-sized for the total number of guests on the property!! The beach chairs are packed side by side like sardines. You cannot budge a chair 4 inches either way so you can put your feet on each side of your beach chair. Dozens of the blue beach chairs are worn due to far too many jumbo sized folks dropping into a chair like an elephant into the deep end of the pool.. Krr..plunk!! The palapa umbrellas around the beach recliners are maybe 48 inches tall at the most.. From the sand. This mean you need to be less than 4 feet tall to walk through that area. I know they are for shade but if they had been mounted at about 7 feet then the total shade area for each palapa would have been increased..Duuuuuuu! We encountered many Europeans the last two days and nights. Smokers everywhere! Dang if you did not see them dropping butts on the sandy beach!!! What in the heck are they thinking?? Not one employee walking the beach as life guards or for security or just to be of any assistance throughout the day..!! Entertainment director needs to be sent packing !!! They have some good talent in the entertainment team but over=all the quality of the show was no better than a (small town) high school. Again..it all starts with the top guy. He was not a show director nor was he very talented. NONE of the entertainment crew could sing a note ! They lip sang to songs 10 years ago. We have seen some GREAT shows at Catalonia resorts and our hopes were high for Wyndam Maya...but no way no how for the nightly shows. The entertainment staff is as you know the activity folks as well. They were never around until around 11 in the morning. They were not really sincere in asking you if you wanted to participate in any events or activities with some exceptions I am sure...but the dancers we saw or spoke to us were very non caring at all. One guy in fact was only interested in you if you were female, attractive and over 20 years of age. It was pretty obvious!!!! The price we paid was a very affordable price...but for us we had a much better over-all experience with Catalonia resorts at pretty much the same cost per night.

We stayed for 7 nights from June 21st-28th. This was a wonderful vacation and to anyone that is on the fence, I say book it because you will not regret it. There are, however, a few things you should be aware of before I tell about the positives. Negatives: The walls are really thin, so about 7 a.m. it gets pretty noisy in the hallway. I am a pretty heavy sleeper and I had trouble sleeping in. I think some ear plugs would have remedied that problem, so I suggest that if you want to sleep in you should bring some. Also, there is a mini fridge in the room, but it does not get stocked. It was not that big a deal, we bought a bottle of water from the gift shop then filled it up throughout the day and at night, and it was no problem and the purified water never made us sick. Again, these were not huge issues but something to be aware of. Positives: The beach is fantastic. We went to Playacar last year, and the difference between the beach then and now is amazing. Last year, the beaches were very narrow with huge sandbags obscuring the ocean view, but that is not an issue this year. The sandbags are gone, and the beach is deep with soft sand, it is perfect. The staff is great, from the entertainment staff and front desk staff to the bar and restaurant staff, they are a pleasure. On our last day, we had to check out at noon, but our van didn't arrive until 2:30, so the front desk allowed us to keep our wrist bands until 2:30 so that we could continue to eat and drink until our van arrived. They didn't have to do that, but they went the extra mile, and we really appreciated that. The buffet restaurant was pretty good, a little better than the previous all inclusives we had been to. The specialty restaurant Portofino is excellent, and the Don Diego is even better. The shows at night are a little cheesy, but we had a great time every night watching it.

The beach and pool were both very pretty with lots of room and activities. Its true that people do reserve thier chairs but we were able to get chairs under shade every day. The bartenders at the pool and above were very nice and accomidating. The food in the buffet is varied from basic to gourmet..may I recommend the pasta bar..pasta every way you can imagine! We were able to make reservations at Portifino and Bambo(at the azteca) Both dinners were wonderful. Let me just say that all the reviews from unhappy patrons are way off..we enjoyed every meal at the buffet(even though it is hot inside) My 10 yr old Daughter especially enjoyed the al a carte meals: she was able to try Sushi at bamboo and battered galoto ..at Portifino she had seafood seafood seafood!!!!

Just a few suggestions for future travelers..take an empty water bottle to fill at the drink stations to keep in your room fridge/no need to buy water off resort ..if your traveling during the rainy season the resort has umbrellas for guests to use during their stay but they go fast! ..check out the pottery painting stand by the stage during the day(for about 15 us) you can paint a great memory to take home(the artist at the stall will put details on it when your done and glaze the piece so that you have a finished piece by ten am the next day)We did it twice each!..and if your doing excursions We would recommend the bonaza Horse back riding..about 70 us each and we were able to book the day before!!

We were in the 3000 building. Room 3113, 1st floor facing the quiet pool. Was a great room, very clean with a king sized bed. Yes, the bed is hard, but that doesn't prevent good sleep. Also had a jetted tub and walk in shower. Everything was in good repair and very comfortable. My son had a folding bed to sleep on that he thought was comfortable too. Fresh linens and towels were brought everyday. Our room had a mini fridge that was empty. When we inquired about water we were told that it was not included in our room rate. We had booked through Expedia. Was not a big deal, so we went across the road to the little shopping plaza and bought water there. The bartenders are happy to refill your empty water bottles for you. Our room had central air and it worked very well to keep our room cool. We never saw a single bug. If we needed anything all I had to do was ask one of the house keepers and she would get it for us. I knew before hand from TA that wash cloths were not provided so we brought some from home. There's no charge for the room safe and it's very easy to use.We left a two dollar tip each day for the maids. If I had pesos I would leave those. The grounds are just beautiful, gardeners are always working and someone is always cleaning up. There's lots of animals to see too. Cute agouti, lizards and lots of birds. I really enjoyed walking around the resort. For our eleven day stay we ate at five of the ala carte's. We enjoyed them all, but the best was Don Diego's. It was my older son's birthday and they set him up with tequila shots and a special birthday cake. He wore a big sombrero and everyone sang happy birthday! Really made our dinner special! We also enjoyed Bamboo (Asian, good sushi), Miramar (Italian, beautiful view), Portifino, and the Mayan (sorry, can't remember the name). Bamboo and the Mayan are located just a little north of VWM at the Azteca. Was a nice walk in the evening. Had absolutely no trouble at all booking our meals. I just have to say at this point that all of the personnel and the entire staff are wonderful and easy to work with. We really enjoyed the buffet! Yes, it's hot there, but it is very common for the resorts to have the buffets open air. It didn't bother us a bit. The food was very good, and we enjoyed it alot. We've been to three different resorts in Mexico so far, and I have to say the food at this one was the best. Out by the activity pool is the snack bar, and we enjoyed taking nachos, pizza and burgers to the beach. Never tried the different casseroles or soup, but lots of people seemed to be eating those things and enjoying too. The animation crew are very hard working people! They work all day doing activities and then they put on the shows in the evening. Some of the shows were lots of fun, and others not so much. We were always entertained. I really loved taking the Spanish classes, and met some great people from all around the world. Arlene is the sweetest, most patient young lady who taught the class. How she keeps up with all the languages she does I'll never know. Other staff members I should mention are Jose at the pool bar and Armondo at the quiet bar. Both gave great service with a smile, poured good and plentiful drinks. I guess I should mention the beach before I close, it was just beautiful! In some places the new beach has eroded and makes quite a big step to the water, but this shouldn't discourage anyone from enjoying the soft, white sand and the turquoise blue sea! Many people did play the towel game for reserving chairs under the palapas. There is a sign that says please don't do that, but people just ignored the sign. We had to search most days, but were able to find chairs in the shade. We really enjoyed the Viva Wyndham Maya and as I write this I'm having serious withdrawals from lovely Playacar and Playa del Carmen.

We've done the all-inclusive vacations before so we knew what to expect, but this was way below our expectations. Firstly, their photos and information about the hotel is very misleading and inaccurate (even their pamphlets IN the room are incorrect). We had a 'superior' room, which was a concrete slab with a crap mattress and an 'open' bathroom with no privacy. The beds are not good and the pillows are flat and old. When we checked in, there were towels missing so we had to go ask for some. The ONLY amenities you will get is a bar of soap and some NASTY shampoo in a dispenser in the shower. We immediately went out and bought all our own supplies. The shower itself is dirty and mouldy, I had to wear flip flops each time I showered. The towels were old and some had holes. When we asked for our rooms to be cleaned, they seemed to only get a basic service (ie. beds made), because the sink was not cleaned once and the ONE hand soap we got did not get replaced the entire week we were there! nasty. The food is also awful. Let's get one thing clear: the all-inclusive is a bunch of crap. Basically they advertise as 1 buffet and 3 a-la-carte restaurants, plus access to use the restaurants at the sister hotel. NOT TRUE! On our second morning there I went to make reservations for an a la carte restaurant, but I was told (by a very rude guest services agent) that during a 7 day stay I can only use a-la-carte restaurants 3 times. It gets better.....this was monday and the next available reservation for ANY restaurant was....THURSDAY! So I booked for 2 restaurants (thurs and fri) and the agent told me to book for the sister hotel ON THE DAY. So I had 1 more restaurant reservation left and I planned to use it for the sister hotel. A few days later I arrive at the desk at 8.30am (they open 8am) to book for the sister hotel only to be told \"ALL BOOKED!\". She reminded me that I can't book for the sister resort in advance, yet 8.30am seemed to be 'too late', so I asked her to just go ahead and book me the 3rd a-la-carte in the hotel we were staying at. She said \"monday\", I told her no, we leave on sunday. She just shrugged and that was the end of that. So out of 7 days there, we got 2 a-la-carte meals which weren't good anyway. The buffet there is AWFUL! And I mean really, REALLY bad. The food is the same each day, no themes, no variety. Everything tastes the same and often they run out of food which they don't care to replace. I had an upset stomach every single day. The drinks are watered down and all taste the same, you could drink 'cocktails' all day and not feel any effect. The pool is dirty with lots of sand in it, the pool bar is small and crappy, the area around the pool and bar is extremely slippery so beware! The beach itself is nice, probably the only GOOD aspect of it all. Nightly entertainment is also pretty crap. The 'shows' last about 45mins and after that everything dies down. The so-called 'disco' is dead every night, we tried 3 nights and even on a friday there were only 5 people there. It was dead. I went to the pool bar for a drink at 1am and there was nobody to be found, I don't know what people do there for entertainment? There was also nothing mexican about the resort, food or entertainment. Usually at other resorts they'll incorporate the local music/culture into the shows, not this place. It was cheesy and very tacky (ie. 'las vegas night', '70s night' etc). The information pamphlet says that bottled water will be supplied in the room daily yet we didn't get any. So we rang front desk and were put on hold, then transferred around to a few people who didn't seem to know what we were talking about. We told them it's in the pamphlet, they told us that it must be wrong or something. Great. Buy your own bottles of water. Also, the pamphlet says that there's nightly adult entertainment at 11.30pm, listing activities such as: tequila contest, wet t-shirt contest, merengue dancing etc. This was nowhere to be found so one night we asked front desk. The agent gave us an awkward look and said there is nothing but the 'disco'. So again, wrong information. Also, be prepared to be harrassed a lot by staff trying to get you to buy more stuff. On the first day we were told we had an APPOINTMENT the next morning at 9am with a rep from some company, to do a welcome presentation. So on our first day of vacation we get up early for this, only to learn that this was just a guy trying to get us to book a lot of EXPENSIVE tours. The next day we found a note on our door saying to go see the 'VIP desk\" for some free gifts. We went there and were made to sit down with some guy for half an hour, he basically tried to get us to commit to another presentation where they will offer us a SPECIAL GIFT. the gift, turns out, is a discounted stay at one of their resorts, valid for 18 months but you have to take a credit card to the presentation and put down a deposit. First we agreed, but then cancelled (they tried VERY hard to get us to go). All one big scam. So overall the stay was awful. We would never go back there again. We were supposed to be on vacation, yet a lot of the time we felt like we were just being ripped off and they were trying to get more money out of us. The entertainment was crap, not much to do, food was terrible and the guest services staff are rude. The only nice people there were the food and beverage servers.

The food was better than average as I never went hungry or disappointed. The Mediterranean restaurant was more than fabulous tho! Very enjoyable - excellent service!! The bar service was 100% excellent. Tons to choose from and always ready to serve you with a positive attitude. The pool areas - as said before be careful - slippery when wet - common sense needs to be used when around pool areas. Its not just this resort this applies to either! Lots of chairs to choose from and not sure if it was the time of year I went, but I did not find any problem with locating a seat. Mind you I'm not one for sitting around the pool all day either. The cleanliness of the resort - rates 10 stars !! And these people never quit working and are very happy to greet you with a hola everytime! From the groundkeepers to the restaurant areas to the rooms - there is always someone around the corner collecting trash, dirty dishes, ensuring your rooms are spotless and done in a very timely manner. Sure there are no water bottles in the rooms, but the hotel does promote environmental responsibility, therefore doesn't it make sense not to have water bottles daily? I went to the store bought myself a couple of bottles and used throughout the stay. Tons of water available at the bar areas. The grounds are beautiful !! A superior job in grooming and upkeep. The signage of the plants are informative and adds to being informed. I loved the covered walkways with the gardens - it was spectacular to say the least. The staff - hotel lobby - great service - always willing to help with a smile. The activity stafff - always looking to get you involved, but not pushy! I was very impressed with the staff with the children - I have been to other resorts and have not seen such a job well done - very commendable! I recommend this hotel to families - well organized in that manner.

The location of the resort is excellent. It lies within a gated community of Playacar. The beach is beautiful. The food was good. As soon as we checked in, I made reservations for Portofino and the Mexican restaurant. We were only able to get in two dinner reservations. Not sure why it was so difficult but I have my assumptions. The nightly shows were entertaining. You have to give the staff credit for all the hard work they do. The only complaints I have is our room was in the 1200 building on the first floor right next to the stairs and every morning between 6-6:30 people would drag their suitcases down the flight of ceramic tile stairs. As you can imagine the sound was horrible. Our patio faced the service road that the workers transported carts so that was noisy too. Also, you can hear the guests walking in the hallways and from the floors above, especially when they were wearing heels. I agee with the other reviews that the walls are thin and the rooms just echo. As far as the excursions go, we were able to ride bicycles that the hotel provided to Playa Del Carmen. It took approx 15-20 minutes to get to the town. You were able to ride on the sidewalks on the opposite side of the hotel. It was a scenic path. Highly recommend doing. Their is a 3 hour limit for the bicycles. The next day we did take the cab for $5 us dollars to Playa Del Carmen only because we took the ferry to Cozumel for some snorkeling. The snorkeling trip in Cozumel was great. When you get off the ferry, walk down to the end of the snorkeling booths to \"Dumar\" The snorkeling guides were great. We bought a one way ferry ticket for $11 us dollars. Purchase another one way ticket for the way back so your not subjected to coming back at a certain time. We also took the cab for $22 us dollars one way to Akumal Bay. Sea turtle heaven. It was well worth it. All in all my family had a great time and my daughter loved the ocean waves, trapeeze and the snorkeling.

We stayed at Viva Wyndham Maya from June 6 to June 12 of 2010. The Good: The beach is amazing. It is very clean. The entertainment staff was friendly and did a great job keeping people entertained with beach volleyball, yoga, salsa and merengue dance classes, etc. They have alot of activities throughout the day plus each night they had different type of shows which were very entertaining. The nightly disco was also really nice. The beach security was also very good, made us feel safe. The Bad: The food is not so good. Expect the same food for breakfast, lunch and dinner every single day for your whole stay and also expect to see empty food trays or pans on the buffet line which further reduces your food choices or options. Also the buffet area is very small and gets crowded very quickly. Expect to see unfriendly and unpolite kitchen staff. The front desk not so friendly either. The drinks are all watered down on all the bars. Lots of drink choices but not so good. The rooms were average to good, but is loud during the night. Make sure you take ear plugs. Never had problems with the a/c. We had to keep asking for extra towels, they would usually leave only two when we were a family of four. I will definitely go back to the Riviera Maya area and Cancun but I will not stay in this hotel again unless they make a major upgrade with their kitchen and food issues. I recommend Playa del Carmen, but for now, I do not recommend this hotel.

(we paid 711$ a person for the trip which included airfare insurance ride to hotel and insurance) We booked the upgraded jacuzzi room I booked this vacation with an open mind... its all inclusive and a great price, we have been to other AI in bahamas and dominican republic) Needless to say after some of the reviews I was very concerned. We arrived at the resort around 3 pm, check in was very fast and we were given a room in the 3000 block.. I was very upset because I knew this building had bad reviews and was far away from the main areas. Well the room was an excellent surprise.. it was ground floor with a jacuzzi, shower stall, separate toilet area and double sinks, marble floors and plenty of storage for clothing (we also brought additional hangers with us for the closet which came in handy) Perfect A/C and a flat screen TV. There was a mini fridge but no water (which worked out okay because I had brought with us two 30oz water bottles to refill at the bar ) . The sliding doors opened to the \"relax\" bowl which I hesitate to even mention because I don't want to spoil it. There was a small bar there which was open 10-6 and the pool was open 8-8, it had a Jacuzzi and PLENTY of lounge chairs. There was hardly ever anyone there and no children allowed. This was the only pool we used we never used the main pool. It was perfect for just reading a book, having a drink and relaxing. The Beach was absolutely gorgeous and we never had problems finding a chair. We had all yellow and red flag days but since we are from NY we are used to waves. If you walked left you could go to the azteca (four resorts down) which you can use. Further down are Mayan ruins (about 15-20 min walk) which i would recommended finding. One thing about this beach is there is absolutely no people trying to sell you something. It is the only location we have been that you are not harassed to buy various items from locals on the beach, which was good and bad. Bad for prices, good for relaxing ha, Out side of the main gate is a fairly large shopping area. Everything from Pharmacy, Snack, Starbucks, Jewelery, cigars etc. They are a tiny bit over priced but a lot of good stuff. Food: The buffet is poorly designed. It is basically a large square with hot cooking stations in the center. It gets very crowded and extremely hot. The food on there is nothing to ruin your trip but nothing to write home about. Honestly it was not enjoyable eating in the buffet area.. we only ate there for breakfast (go early to avoid the crowd) and the first few nights for dinner. For lunch we always went to the beach buffet (and late night.. open 11-6 but def dinner left overs) The brick oven pizza was absolutely delicious, there was always plenty to go around, they made it non stop. My boyfriend ate the burgers and fries a lot which were decent. We booked the specialty restaurants our second morning there with no issue. We booked three nights (fri, sat, sun and we booked on wed. ) The Mexican restaurant was absolutely amazing and a very fun experience, you must book. The Mediterranean was also delicious but not quite as fun as the Mexican but then again you are in Mexico. We canceled our reservations for the Italian restaurant because we decided to do the Xcaret tour and got back at 930pm. We did two excursions. Which were booked through our oribtz./mayaland representative..Xcaret plus and Tulum/Tankha. I would recommend both tours .Tulum was amazing. The trip starts off with driving a 4X4 in the jungle.. then zip lining over a lagoon then canoeing back, finally a dive in a Cenote and lunch in a Mayan Village (cost about 110 a person everything was included). Xcaret was also amazing but you truly need two days to visit. There is so much to see and do they have sea turtles, dolphins, mantees, sharks, excellent snorkeling, natural pools, underground rivers, a Mayan village, Mayan ruins and so much more. At night they put on an absolutely amazing show which goes through Mexico's history. We sat in the section where you could order drinks and found it very enjoyable we spent about 30$ us on 4 very large drinks. Also i would recommend ordering the drink which comes in a pineapple on the beach, absolutely delicious. This resort was an amazing surprise. When we started walking around our first day we were shocked at how beautiful it was. Tons of wildlife, plants, beautiful hidden areas etc. We had an amazing trip and I honestly want to return to Playa Del Carmen next year, though I would stay at another resort within the playacar complex. The only negative about this resort is the buffet, but if it bothers you so much you can just walk down to Azteca and use theirs which is better designed (Which we did not) I would recommend bringing Bring loads of sunblock and toiletries, extra hangers, clips to hang your bathing suits, and refillable water bottles . We had a great time and would recommend this hotel to our friends. There are tons and tons of things to do in the area for everyone. They have many other excursions and places to visit in this area which is a big reason I want to go back. Every place you visit is more beautiful then the last and reasonable prices everywhere.

This was to be a vacation to relax, kick-back and just get away from 'reality'. This was accomplished. Our expectations were solely based on a prior trip to a resort in Puerta Vallarta in 2008. We chose the Playa del Carmen area based on reviews here. We chose the Viva Wyndham Maya based on price and positive reviews. We take everything with a grain of salt and try to make our own judgments. GROUNDS: The grounds were beautifully manicured. Wide varieties of Palm Trees, flowers and flowering trees. ROOMS: The room size was fine. You had basic essentials and asking for more of anything proved difficult. We were a family of three traveling ... but yet we had to ask for a third bath towel every day. We even left notes, in spanish, with a dollar or two, asking for towels. They only filled the fridge once with one bottle of water, one jar of orange juice, one can of 7up and one can of Pepsi. They will NOT give you more. AND, we bought some 7up and had one can left and poof - it was gone from the fridge! Our room wouldn't be cleaned until well after 4 pm daily ... might have been because the housekeeper was busy watching TV in the rooms she was cleaning. No, we did not complain - mostly because it seemed like the lack of understanding of the English language was great, that it was very very difficult to communicate. We made do. RESORT ACTIVITIES: There was certainly plenty to do and a very upbeat group of staff who try to coax you join in. There were not rude or obnoxious about it, and it was great to see there constant presence. They were a great group of 'kids' and were certainly there to make sure everyone who wanted to join in and have fun, did. We did the Spanish lessons, water aerobics and attempted some dance lessons (we are completely spazstic and so the dancing was NOT for us - LOL). EXCURSIONS: Wow, what can I say .... take out a second mortgage for almost all of the excursions. You can try to 'shop around' but the prices are high. I would bet you could get some free if you are willing to listen to the timeshare people - we chose not to. SHOPPING: There is a strip mall adjacent to the resort. It's very nice and there is a lot of variety. We encountered most people who were not willing to bargain so we did not buy certain items there due to that. We went down to the 5th Avenue shopping area as well. The shops where your taxi drops you off are high-end boutique shops, a block or two in, are the market shops. These people are very aggressive! Be prepared and know your prices and stand firm. They talk fast. On Tuesday and Friday nights, they have merchants selling their 'stuff' on the resort. Same stuff you find across the street and down by the 5th Avenue shopping area. HOWEVER, be sure to look for Enrique!!! He paints beautiful scenery on tiles with his fingers - unbelievable! And, he sells them for $10 USD - so certainly not expensive by any means. FOOD: I don't typically give my two cents about food because tastes are so different. But, this time, I will give my opinion (and that of my family). The buffet, in our opinion, was nasty. Part of the problem, in my opinion, is first the location of the buffet. At the front of the resort with no shade and the air barely moving, and factor in the heat from the kitchen and the warmers for the food, and it was hot. There was a variety of food, but we didn't care for most of it. I don't know if the food was more to the liking of the Europeans, Canadians or whomever, but we did not care for most of it. The pool snack bar had the hamburgers which were alright, hot dogs (which we never tried), french fries which were never hot, and the very very very yummy brick oven pizza! We got a reservation at the Medeterranean restaurant and the Mexican Restaurant. The Med. was very good and the Mexican was even better! BARS: You had to 'ask' for more alcohol in the drinks 'cause they were pretty chinsy with it. But whatever. RENOVO SPA: YAY!!! This was awesome. First hint, when you go in to 'check it out' ask if they have any specials. They were not quick to volunteer this information, but I asked and lo and behold they had one. I had the best 80 minute massage that I've ever ever ever had in my whole life! It was a combination Swedish massage/Deep Tissue massage for about $76 USD - originally $109. GENERAL: Due to a tropical storm a couple of weeks ago in Guatemala, the weather was unseasonably hot and humid. Obviously, this is something nobody has control over, so this was more of a disappointment than anything else, HOWEVER, the resort has no place to cool off other than your room. The pools would have been fine except that due to the heat, the pools weren't even refreshing. Honestly, we were disappointed in a lot of things. Some were clearly uncontrollable and other things, well, they were what they were. We treated all the staff with courtesy and respect and didn't walk in demanding anything. Unfortunately, the staff weren't as friendly and upbeat as we're accustomed to. Be that as it may, we relaxed, we didn't make beds, we didn't do dishes and we didn't cook meals. All in all, we had a nice vacation, for all intents and purposes. But, we would not visit the Cancun/Playa del Carmen side again. The ocean may be beautiful, but everything else didn't meet our expectations.

Ill briefly walk you through our trip! We arrived on a Monday morning into the Cancun airport. Going through customs and picking up our luggage was no hassle. Exiting the airport the only taxis available were by the Hertz company. They charged 90 one way to the resort. The car ride was about an hour but was pleasant and fairly scenic and our taxi driver was super nice. Upon entering Playacar (I guess this is similar to a neighborhood in the us) we were suprised to discover it was a beautiful gated community with large homes that was quite clearly safe. We went on this trip expecting to be in the middle of a ghetto. This community is very nice and very safe. Policia everywhere and you cant even get into Playacar without stopping at the checkpoint to verify clearance. There were people walking around and riding bikes from all walks of life. It almost felt like home. We arrived at the resort early not really expecting to be let into our rooms since it was about 1030 and we werent set to check in until 3. The front deskl staff was extremely friendly and did what he could to get us in early. We finally were let in about 2. They kept our luggage up front so we were able to roam around the resort and get familiar. We even got to eat lunch schedule some excursions and hang out on the beach until then. One of the staff even came and found us while we were waiting to let us know our rooms were ready. During our stay we were treated very well by all staff from busboys to cleaning people and even the performers for the shows. We were encouraged to participate in activites but not pressured. I couldnt have asked for a better staff and we even got to know a few of them. They work 14 hour days and somehow are still able to maintain a pleasant demeanor that is completely genuine and warm. They even invited us out on the town with them one night to party! In our rooms we had a cleaning lady everyday who did an amazing job she even would fold our clothes and stack them neatly on the bed or chair. When we asked for more bottles of water politely with a note as we were suggested to do by another trip advisor reviewee we were given them without even having to tip. We didnt tip muchn since we didnt carry money on us most days but were still treated kindly and better than we could have hoped. Our rooms were always clean and never had a problem with bugs or dirt. The only thing to complain about in the room was no alarm clock and the beds were kind of uncomfortable. My fiancee had a bit more trouble sleeping than i did and i tossed and turned alot of nights as well. One of the coolest things we did there was a snorkeling tour with Scuba Caribe which is the on site scuba snorkeling company. We had a very pleasant experience except for our run in with the company owner who was a know it all republican but thats neither here nor there. We paid 85 a person for Snorkeling tour which brought us to Akumal and Dos Ojos (Freshwater Caves) which was very very cool especially the caves. One of the most amazing things i've ever done in my life!! We found out later when shopping on 5th ave that u can get similar trips at alot cheaper rates. So if you are interested in snorkeling or scuba go off the resort and book them elsewhere. 5th avenue is the shopping center of Playa Del Carmen and is also where the ferry to cozumel is located. Highly recommend that you visit here for souvenirs and any shopping you want to do. It is also very safe we ewen saw mexican army driving around in a humvee randomly. Dont stray too far down any side streets as u run into a sheisty crowd of banditos trying to sell u coke, weed, ecstasy and coochi coochi. We were offered several times before we decided it was in our best interest to stay near the main road. The food was not horrible but it wasnt great. Our reservations were for Portofino (mediterranean/italian) and Don Diego(Mexican). we were super impressed bby the food at Don Diego it was the best we had on the resort. The main dining hall is a buffet. you cant expect greatness from a buffet no matter where u go....unless its vegas! lol. So for what it was it was decent. They have serve yourself beer and wine on tap what more can u ask for. The snack grill by the pool was convenient and the brick oven pizza there is pretty much amazing especially drunk!!! At the pool bar get to know carlos he is the best bartender in the place super friendly awesome drinks and def puts on a show! He played jokes on people and you could tell he was def enjoying his job! Overall it was awesome. Biggest complaint was the bed. The food could have been better but wasnt horrible.

Awesome location on the beach. White sand beach and perfect warm water. 2. Sister hotel (Viva Azteca) is 3 buildings away. When you walk off resort, go to the right. You can eat at those restaurants too. Azteca is so much cleaner, has friendly staff, nice dining area and food is properly cooked and tastes better. CONS: 1. Staff not friendly, especially front desk. They do not have any knowledge about anything! And they hardly speak English. When we checked in they said we had to pay an extra $200 since my reservations were for one person and not two. However, I had documentation showing I made reservations online for two people. 2. Rooms are dirty, bug infested and gross. (Since we went with 2 other couples, we checked out their rooms and they have the same cleanliness issues in their rooms as we did). One of the nights there was a huge cockroach on our bed. HUGE! 3. When we first checked in they put up in a smoking room when my reservations were clearly made for NON-smoking. The air conditioner was out. When we called the front desk they stated our AC was being worked on and it should be up and running in 2 hours or so. It was 90 degrees inside the room! My husband called front desk and asked to be moved to a different room they said nothing was available and we should check back in the morning. I called about 15 seconds later and explained that I paid extra to be in a non-smoking and expected just that. We were then escorted to TWO empty rooms and told to pick one of them. We immediately relocated to a cleaner room (but it's a stretch when I say cleaner than the previous room). 4. Food sucked! The buffet for breakfast/lunch/dinner was HORRIBLE. No matter what we ate we both would get sick. We stuck to fruits and veggies. And ate out as often as possible. The eating area/restaurant where the buffet is was extremely hot every single moment of the day. They have ceiling fans but it doesn't help when all it does is circulate hot air. Just an unpleasant atmosphere all around. 5. When we tried to make reservations for any of the restaurants we were told they are all booked and we'd be stuck eating at the buffet all week. The next day we spoke with another reservation specialist, Ghaila (who is wonderful). She got us TWO reservations. The mexican restaurant had the best food. Our waiter, Elio, was friendly and spoke English. Very nice restaurant and it was air conditioned! You have to go to the Mexican restaurant if you stay at this resort. 6. If there was any food left over from dinner it was served at the pool grill. However, pizza was made fresh nightly at 11 p.m. I suggest the cheese pizza. It was the best from what we sampled. Drinks were ok. I highly recommend catching a cab to Fifth Ave. It's a $5 USD ride each way. There are plenty of restaurants in this shopping strip/area. It's a wild time so make sure you wear comfortable shoes. Across from the resort is Playa Plaza. There is a Starbucks and free wi-fi upstairs. The resort has internet access but you have to pay $2 USD for 40 minutes. There are no pay phones at the resort so if you need to make a call home, go to Playa Plaza.

We went for our honeymoon, and from reading the description online, we thought they had actual honeymoon suites, which they did not. It was just a room with a king-sized bed. We arrived Sunday night, and after being harassed by the taxi drivers at the airport (who wanted $90! Don't do it, you can get it for less!), we made it to the hotel during a rainstorm. The tile used throughout the hotel is extremely slippery when wet, and we nearly fell several times while trying to make it to our hotel room. The location of our room was nice, we were on the ground floor on the beach, but the actual room was very sparse. I typically don't bring shampoo/conditioner on my trips, b/c I just use what the hotel provides, but they do not provide that at the Wyndham Maya. There were a few soap dispensers on the wall, one labeled 'shampoo' but it was awful and dried out my hair. Lesson learned. The room was decent sized, and it had a safe and a mini-fridge, which was nice, but the bed was extremely hard, the walls were concrete, and the room wasn't very cozy. I would say, utilitarian. It had a very musty odor. Fortunately, the room's saving grace was that it was air conditioned, but we never got the smell out. All of our clothes smelled terrible. We tried to get a better room, but they insisted that we had a premium room... Our room wasn't as nice looking as the pictures on their website. It is very important to know that when you are in your room, you can hear *everything* going on in the hallway or in the adjacent room. It got so bad one night that we had to call the front desk to complain about our neighbors. There are large gaps at the bottoms of the doors, and it pretty much ruled out sleeping in, which we had wanted to do on our vacation. As soon as housekeeping rolled its carts down the hallway, you were awake. The breakfast buffet was great, but the lunch and dinner selection on the buffet was awful. We mostly ate at the snack bar, which had the *best* pizza, and had hamburgers, hotdogs, fries, chips and guacamole. That was our main diet while we were there. The a-la-carte restaurants on site were a joke. Since we arrived Sunday night, we didn't have a chance to get a restaurant reservation through guest services until Monday morning. When I went to get a reservation, I was told there weren't any openings until Thursday. Which was our last day there, I couldn't believe it. The guest services rep handed me a reservation for Monday night, but got very snotty, explaining that she was doing me a huge favor by getting me a reservation for that night. When was I supposed to make the reservation, before we got there? So we went to Portofino's that night and the place was half full, despite guest service's claim that they were booked for the night. We met another couple who went to the mexican restaurant that same night, and they said that it was also just half full. So Tuesday night we all went to the mexican restaurant without reservations, and again they were half full. They told us they couldn't seat us without a reservation. WHAT?? Finally after some groveling, they seated us and we had a mediocre dinner. Portofino's was also mediocre. I got chicken stuffed with crab, and never found the crab, just mushrooms, which weren't listed in the entree's description. I hate mushrooms. So stick with the snack bar at the pool. The pool bar was nice, but they will make your drinks with cheap liquor unless you specify that you want a particular brand. They were happy to do so when asked. They were all very nice, though some were better at making drinks than others, so if you find a good one, keep going to him. The beach was beautiful. There were plenty of beach chairs, and we rented boogy-boards a few times to play in the water, which was fun. It had been storming that week, so the water was rough, which was disappointing b/c we had wanted to go snorkling. There was always something to do, the activities staff were always organizing things. Unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, the tile used throughout the property is extremely slick. Many people slipped and injured themselves, and there were 'caution' cones everywhere. My husband actually slipped while getting into the pool and broke his toe! It pretty much ruined the rest of our plans, we had purchased an excursion trip but had to cancel it. When he broke his toe, we were told that if we wanted the resort doctor to take a look at it, it would cost us $100. Fine, whatever, but it seemed ridiculous considering he broke is toe getting into *their* pool. Fortunately the doctor never charged us. My husband spent the rest of our trip limping around the resort with his foot bandaged. Everyone there smokes. As a non-smoker, I was very aware of this. Most of the guests were from Europe or South America, which I was originally excited about, I love talking to people from other countries, but they all smoked, and most of them were not very friendly. We met a few people from the US and Canada who were very nice and we spent a lot of time hanging out with. We really enjoyed Playa del Carmen, but won't be returning to this resort. We might try another in Playa, or in another town a little closer to Cancun.", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMy friends & I had the best vacation...\u201d", "Author": "Chsrkat1", "ReviewID": "UR66029315", "Content": "My friends & I had the best vacation here.

What can I say other than I just LOVE it there! This is the first time I stayed and the Wyndham and I enjoyed my time there. I'll give a brief description of a few things... Beach: The beach was amazing. Perfect water, no rocks, fabulous location! Probably one of the better beaches in the area. Plenty of sand to play around in. The Pool: The pool was a bit on the smaller side and was a little packed at times. The swim up bar was poorly staffed. Luckily, all you had to do was walk up to the top side and the bartenders up there were very friendly. If you ask for top shelf they will give it to you. May I recommend the White Bacardi Mojito? :) The Buffet: The food was decent. Not great, not horrible. I could usually find something to eat. I would hope for a little more variety, but it was decent. The only real issue I had was when we woke up late and it was towards the end of the eating period everything was pretty hard as a rock, get there early! The Restaurants: The Italian (at Azteca) was delicious. Fabulous waitress there as well! The beef was cooked perfectly! The Mexican and Mediterannian were ok. The Med. was a little bit better. I got pretty sick after eating at the Mexican restaurant though, which happened to be the night before an early morning flight, not a good combo. The staff that sets up the restaurant reservations were very hard to work with. I recommend booking them in the early morning between 8-9am. That's when they seemed to be the nicest. The Rooms: The rooms were pretty musty. The ac worked but towards the middle of the night it got to be a little hard to sleep. Nothing really dried in there either. And it's true, you can hear everything in the hallways, EVERYTHING. That was a little distracting at times, but didn't ruin our trip. The Grounds: They were beautiful. They did a great job keeping them up and there was tons of wildlife on site. It was nicely done. The Bikes: I recommend taking the bikes out for a ride to Downtown PDX. They are tons of fun, and you can lock them up on your way in. It was a longer walk than expected from the hotel, and I'm glad that we took the bikes! All in all, I liked the Wyndham, but would probably stay someplace else the next time. I have stayed at the Blue Bay and would probably go back there for the overall quality of the hotel. But you can't beat the Wyndham for the price and location.", "Date": "May 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lexington, KY", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, enjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "The_Peritores", "ReviewID": "UR65306238", "Content": "We chose the Viva Wyndham Maya for our 3-day Babymoon because of the value in price it seemed to offer and the short travel time from Lexington. We were more than pleasantly surprised by the entire trip and would definitely visit again. After arriving in Cancun, the customs process was well organized and we were through in less than 45 minutes. Not having checked our luggage, and knowing we only had 72 hours to enjoy ourselves, we went straight to find a taxi to the hotel, even though we already purchased transfers (a mistake). Upon reading reviews here we wanted to forgo the extra long travel time in taking a community van or bus and head directly for the resort. We made a quick stop to change currency (due to the exchange rate you can save money by negotiating and paying in pesos) and headed to the exit. We changed most of our money here, although in hindsight we should have changed just enough for the taxi and waited till we got to the hotel. The exchange rate was more favorable there. A representative for the Hertz-owned taxi company met us and took us to one of numerous nearby booths and quoted us a price of $90US. We declined and went to the curb where the taxi director quoted us $700 pesos (about $60US). My wife offered $600 pesos (about $50US) and off we went. After about an hour ride and a $10US tip, we were at the front entrance. Check-in was relatively easy, and though we had to come back when the room was ready, they gave us our bracelets and we were able to have lunch and get something to drink. We also took this time to stroll around the property and see the resort. Overall, the food was good. The buffets were more than adequate. Service was friendly and quick. One disappointment was learning right away that all the Ala carte restaurants on the property were booked for the three days we stayed, and had been for a week. Nowhere was there mention that we could have called a few weeks earlier to reserve a table, but evidently we could. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as we were able to get reservations at the Italian and Mayan restaurants over at the Wyndham Azteca, and I can tell you that they both completely exceeded our expectations. White tablecloths, fine dining service, great plate presentations and quality food. The meals lasted about 2 hours so they are not quick. If you go be prepared to spend some time there. So despite the fact that we never even got a chance to try the Mediterranean and Mexican restaurants at our own hotel, we were pleased. The beach was fantastic. Water was a perfect temperature, very much clean, and there was plenty of beach space. We are early risers so no issue getting a good spot, and contrary to what we read on here, you could arrive around 9:30 or even 10:00 and still get a good spot. There seemed to be plenty of beach chairs. Pool was clean, plenty of activity, and the bartenders were friendly and pour a good drink. Although we had read this and did not do it, bring an insulated travel cup for your drinks, especially if you plan on drinking the frozen drinks. It is hot and they melt super fast! They serve drinks in plastic cups and ask that you do not take straws unless you really need them in order to cut down on the amount of garbage, which we had no problem doing. The nighttime shows were entertaining, and the performers worked hard during the shows and then all during the day heading up various activities, which we know are fun from our participation previously at a place in Punta Canta, although we chose to sit most of them out this time around. Knowing we have a little one on the way, we were particularly impressed with the Kids Club, and the attention the staff took in keeping the children occupied and enjoying their vacation for a time so the adults can have some time of their own during the day. It looked as though there were no more than 4 kids per adult. It is a benefit we plan on taking advantage of in the future. Rooms were clean and more than adequate for our needs. Cleanliness is most important to us. The toilet is set too far under the counter, so the lid didn't stay up on it's own, but the shower was really nice - spacious with a removable shower head, fully tiled and plenty of water pressure. There were no washcloths, so if you are used to using them make sure to bring some. Also, they provide shampoo and body wash which was great, but make sure to bring conditioner if you use it. We didn't head into town, but drove through it on the way back to the airport, and its conveniently close location to the resort will make it a must stop on our next visit. We did stroll through the shops just outside of the hotel entrance and found some nice keepsakes at decent prices to take home with us. A lot less haggling was needed than other places we visited, and a complete dearth of vendors to worry about on the beaches, which was also nice. All in all, it was a fantastic, albeit short, trip. No major complaints outside of a request to fix the reservation policy, or at the very least to improve communication about the policies. The drinking water, for some strange reason, tasted much better at the Azteca restaurants than it was at our resort. We stuck mostly to bottled water, and a few dollars to the maids each morning left our rooms clean and our water restocked. A positive recommendation from us, and a great value at the price!", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wichita, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort, great service, all around awesome\u201d", "Author": "LearnToTravelForFree", "ReviewID": "UR65026778", "Content": "Having stayed in the past at a Wyndham Viva all inclusive resort it was easy for me to select this resort when booking my trip, despite mixed reviews. This resort is in a great location, just $5.00 cab ride to the downtown area. It is also only a 5 minute walk to the Wyndham Viva Azteca, where you can also use their amenities. Everywhere that you walk around the resort is very nice. There are plenty of internet hotspots throughout the resort that are well marked. They spray the resort area daily for mosquitoes. The resort has a vacation club, but they do not push it at all. The landscaping and vegetation on the resort is beautiful. There are iguanas and a small animal called a Sereque. These animals will not bother you and they are a delight to look at and take pictures. They have a vacation club, but they do not push it on you or timeshares like other resorts. You will see a desk for it and they will drop an advertisement in your room and that is the last of it. The beach at this resort is very nice and has plenty of room. Finding a lawn chair was not a problem for us any time of the day. The water in the ocean is a perfect temperature and the depth slope is very slow, giving you plenty of room to swim and play in the waves. If you have stayed in Cancun you will know that the beach resorts there do not have much beach room and you are constantly hassled by vendors walking down the beach selling things. You will see very few vendors on this beach, which is nice. The bartenders make good drinks, and if you want them better you can ask for premium liquor (Bacardi, Malibu, SKYY, etc) versus the cheaper stuff. The glasses are small, but they will make you multiple drinks if you are trying to avoid frequent trips. The bars also have premium coffee and can make you a cappuccino or frappuccino. The bar areas are all nice and clean. The pool bar has a snack bar as well that is frequently stocked with nachos, burgers, hot dogs, pizza, and fruit. As for the rest of the food\u2014we tried the Mexican and Mediterranean restaurants on site and the Aztec restaurant at the Azteca. All of these were great. The buffets were so-so. We could find something we liked every time we ate at them, but tried a few things that we did not care for. In the evening they always had a pasta station and The breakfast buffet was great. For the price range of this all inclusive resort, the food was just fine. The rooms were somewhat small, but we did not spend too much time in it so it suited us fine. We did not have any issues with the smell of the room or noise. We could hear the nightly entertainment in our room the nights we retired early; however, it was no louder than a TV on at a very low volume. The room had a nice flat screen TV that had many channel choices. The room had 6 plugins in the bedroom and 2 in the bathroom. The bathroom had a large, oversized shower. The room has a safe that you can fit quite a bit in it, aside a laptop. The air conditioning in the room was great, the room was always nice and cool. The room is equipped with a hair dryer, iron, and ironing board which is not always a given when traveling in Mexico. If you are a scuba diver, there is a dive shop on site and you actually leave on the boat directly from the resort. I dive and have stayed at many resorts that have dive shops on site, but you still have to take a shuttle to board the bus. You can even book your dive trips on site. It was very convenient. We were not aware of this in advance so we booked a few dives with another shop downtown in advance, but we used it later in the week. The pools were very nice. The main pool has a swim up bar. At first glance they seem a bit small, but they were never crowded. There is also an adults only \u201crelax pool\u201d at the other side of the resort. It has a bar right outside of it. There are also private hot tubs at the spa that you can use that were very relaxing. There is also an area for archery and a nice gym. You can also learn to be in the circus as they have a trapeze area with instructors with safety nets and harnesses. There are many activities that go on during the day including dance classes, bingo, and other games. We did not partake in these as we spent most of our time relaxing on the beach. The evening entertainment area is very large and they have a different show each night. We saw a few of the shows, including 70s Night and Comedy Night. Both were ok. Now to the areas that I think the Wyndham Viva Maya can improve: In the room there is no alarm clock. We set our cell phones as an alarm and got by. They give you two towels and one hand towel. It would be helpful to have a few more. The toilet in the bathroom is configured strangely under the counter above it. The lid will not go all the way back as it hits the counter. That said, it will not stand up without being constantly held or up against your back. The walls are a bit thin, you can hear people walking around outside. There was not a refrigerator in our room. The gift shop is very overpriced, sun tan lotion was 219 pesos (over $20 American) so be sure to bring enough. The internet speed was slow, especially for uploads. Don\u2019t expect to upload pictures until you get home. The dive shop we used early in the week tried to call us to notify us of a delayed start time and no one answered the phone. The reservation restaurants were all booked up early in the week, checking in Sunday we were not able to use any until Wednesday. When we ate at these restaurants they were never more than 60% full and many other travelers were not adhering to the dress codes.", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice if you wish to loose Weight\u201d", "Author": "Tonyclaws", "ReviewID": "UR64602963", "Content": "The Hotel overall is very good.

We departed from Denver-Atlanta-Cancun. The flight was ok except for when we arrived at Cancun International Airport. The flight from atlanta to Cancun took ~2hr 30 min. and when we got to the immigration area on 1 May 2010 there were about a THOUSAND people in line and it took about 3hr to get though. Unless you were there you can not imagine the stress with all the screaming kids there. When we finally got thru customs and found our ride to the resort things improved. Everyone said that it is normally not like that. I thought later once I got internet access that it might have had something to due with that idiot that tried to explode a vehicle in times square but that happened after we landed. Anyway the rest of the trip was good. It was a little hot during the first week of May. I will go in November next time. The room was good we got one near the adult pool which was nice and quiet at night as they have a large stage by the main pool area and nightly shows that are loud every night. We also reqested a room with a Jacuzzi tub and we really liked that. The only problem with the room was that they did not have a microwave and the small ridge was not too cold. The room is also the only place with airconditioning. So a few days we would take an afternoon nap because of the heat. The area is very clean and safe. The buffet food was ok and the restaurants were good but you only get to go dinner for 3 nights., book them on your first day. We took two day trips one to the Main Mayan ruins which is a two hour bus ride with a short stop at a tourist trap which was very pretty, one of the many sink holes on the yucatan peninsula, Which you can take a swim in if you desire I think the water was only 64F. I did not jump in but took lots of pictures. Then it was on to the Mayan (Chicken) ruins which was a neat experience, unfortunately 7 years ago they stopped letting people climb it and go inside because people could not follow the do not touch rule and I think a lady fell down the steps and died. It was also just too hot and lots of people trying to sell you stuff but at a fair price, they do bargin and they all have the same stuff so shop around. The other place we went was XCARET nature park which is a must see. We were there all day and loved it we did not even see the whole place. If you go I suggest you do the plus part which allows you to do the underground river which is one of the highlights of the park, I was surprised it took ~40 minutes to complete but was fun. The other must see attraction is the nightly show which is 7pm to 9pm. It is a little long but very well done especially the character costumes as you enter the show arena. The last recommendation I will give is the name of the driver we used he had a new airconditioned car which was great for the hour drive to the resort. The resort charged us $80 but maybe if you call him directly you can have him drive you for a cheaper cost. Tour Conductor: Rodrigo A. Can Manzanero; manzanero_r@hotmail.com; mobile:(998)147 95 87. He was a great driver. If you use him and like your experience tell him Deepika Atkinson recommended him to you.The only other downside was the 20% of people that smoked and thet was a small hassle when we were trying to enjoy ourselves as you are relaxing in a nice spot and all of a sudden you get that awuful smoke smell and have to pinpoint where it is coming from and move to a new spot to avoid it.

I should say right away that I enjoyed my stay at Wyndham Maya, despite certain disappointments. However, I will most likely pick a different hotel next time around. LAYOUT The hotel is rather compact and not stretched across acres of land whereby the only means of transportation is one of those golf carts. STAFF All the personnel at Maya was very friendly and courteous. Don't forget to tip you barman, your maid as well as your restaurant waiter. ROOMS Our room was rather spacious with a dedicated air conditioner. What we did not have was a wardrobe with shelves. We had to keep our clothes inside the bags on the floor. FOOD In my opinion the food was good and well cooked. What I found disappointing is that there was no sea food, except for some sort of white fish fillet. The food was the same every day and there was little variety. Some might say I'm being picky and unfair, but after RIU Tequila 2 years ago, the variety seemed rather scant. You also have 2 restaurants, one Mexican and one Mediterranean, which you are allowed to make a reservation at only once during your stay. They might serve mussels and shrimp at the Mediterranean, but we missed our reservation. What I also did not like is that we had to go for breakfast, lunch and dinner to the same restaurant by the reception. Since we spent most of our time on the beach, it would have been a lot more convenient to have a full selection of food in the restaurant by the pool. Instead, they offered a limited variety of food at the pool restaurant and if I wanted the full variety, I had to go to the main restaurant. It might not be a big deal breaker for some, but it was a bit of a nuance for me. DRINKS Once again, some might say I'm being picky, but I found their mojitos and caipirinhas revolting. There was no real orange juice in the morning and powder juice in juice dispensers was rather unpleasant to taste. EVENING ENTERTAINMENT Phenomenal! Absolutely fantastic! Every evening we had something new and it wasn't just games for couples on stage. These were fully choreographed performances. ACTIVITIES Plenty of these for all types of individuals. There were various games on the beach, dance lessons by the pool, stuff for kids to do, darts. There was even a circus trapeze for those willing to experience what's it like being an acrobat. DISCO One big disappointment. Having to listen to Britney Spears, Beyonce, and Lady Gaga, and Pitbull in pretty much the same sequence every single evening is excruciating. Most party people opted for going clubbing in town. Most clubs charge $30-$50/night for unlimited drinks or $5/mojito. Coco Bongo is $50/night. A taxi ride is typically $5 from hotel to the night club. RIU Tequila's disco was a lot more fun. BEACH The beach suffers some erosion, but it's no big deal. What was of greater concern was the number of rather sharp seashells both on the beach itself and at the bottom of a steep groove just where you enter the ocean. Also, the beach is a public area and keep an eye on your possessions. My friend got his Lacoste flip-flops stolen, yet I should say that we left our cameras and bags on the beach and nothing got stolen. DEMOGRAPHIC A true mix without any dominant linguistic group. Every couple of meters you could hear a different language: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Russian, Polish, etc. There were a lot of couples with and without kids, mostly 25-33 years old. There were also 45-60 year olds and the usual party people 18-25. Wi-Fi Wireless Internet is $5/hour. They also have a room with desktops, but the price is the same per hour. That 60 minutes you purchase can be used up over a period of your stay. They don't expire 60 minutes after you use the activation code. CONCLUSION For $992 I could have gone to a better hotel, such as Princess or some other hotel in Playa del Carmen had I booked a last-minute deal as opposed to a month in advance. My main gripes in short would be the lack of seafood, scant variety of food in general, poor quality of soft drinks and dull disco. Other than that, had we paid $700-$800 and not $992, I would not be complaining.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barnegat, NJ.", "Title": "\u201cWe Had a Great Vacation\u201d", "Author": "Topdown", "ReviewID": "UR63902053", "Content": "Stayed at the Wyndham Maya from 4/27 till 5/10 with my girl. We really enjoyed our vacation. This was our first time in Mexico. Previously we've been to all inclusives 3 different times in Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. We were a little under whelmed on arrival. The lobby was almost non-existent compared to what we were used to and the room was pretty basic. The place grows on you though. By the end of our stay we really liked it quite a lot. The room and the bathroom were large enough to be comfortable and clean. There was a flat screen TV that got about 8 channels of English. There were two large drawers and 2 large shelves, and a closet with a room safe inside. Bring some extra hangers if you can. Although there was no box spring and the mattress was laid over a platform we both found them to be fairly comfortable; firm but not too hard. We had no fridge,but got one delivered to the room within a half hour of asking for it at the front desk. There was a small patio. We could catch a glimpse of the ocean through the trees. It was used by us to hang our beach towels and wet swim suits. There were quite a lot of ants on the patio so we didn't hang out there. We had a great house keeper. We would write a note in simple Spanish (Ex. Por Favor, 3 mas agua y mas toilet paper. Gracias: Which means 3 more waters please and more toilet paper. Thank You) and leave $2 everyday. We always got everything we asked for and the room was well cleaned. Also had a different towel creature waiting for us everyday. Remember to use bottled water when brushing your teeth. We made 3 excursions while we were there. Chitcha Nitza: Famous ruins with a beautiful pyramid and also a ball court and many other ruins. Then a stop at a cenote to refresh ourselves from the hot day.Tulum / Xel-Ha: Beautiful ruins right by the beach, Followed by a short ride to a mostly natural water park Both were awesome and highly recommended. Both left around 7:30 am, and returned early evening from Tulum and 8;30 from C.N. On the other excursion we walked up to a travel booth in Playa Del Carmen by the pier. We bought 2 snorkeling tours in a glass bottom boat for $25 each that left from the dock in Cozumel. To get there we took the ferry for 12 dollars each way.( Only buy one way tickets. The return is more frequent that way and it costs the same). It was well worth the effort. The water was super clear even to the bottom to 30 feet and the fish were very numerous . The day before, I had done a short snorkeling trip about twenty minutes by boat from my resorts beach. I was not very impressed. The snorkeling in Cozumel was way way better. We loved the beach at our resort and it was the main activity for us. The beach replenishment was just completed a couple of months ago and they did a great job. The palapas (cabanas) were closer together than what we were used to in our experiences in Punta Cana. The ones in the row closest to the beach offered the best view to the beautiful water. If you want one of those, you will need to be out there to reserve one no later than 6:45. If you can, bring a couple of beach towels from home. It's nice to have the extra towels and they are easier to spot when you are looking for your lounges. It seemed to us that the center of the beach was more social with either end being quieter. For 8 of our days at the resort, the water was very calm and warm. For 4 of our days there were very strong winds. The water was quite rough and the sand would blow at times. We spent those days at the adults only pool towards the back of the resort. The food was ok. It was on par with the other places we have been to. We only made it once to the restaurant but we could have gone more often if we wanted to. We went to the Mediterranean and it was very good. My only complaint about the Buffet was that the potatoes were always underdone no matter what form they were in. There is a small snack station near the beach where we usually ate lunch. We discovered towards the end of our stay that lunch was way better at the main buffet, and well worth the walk. We found that we got more appreciative service when we handed our tip directly to our waiter instead of leaving it on the table where he might not get it if someone else cleared the table when we left. The liquor was excellent. You can have top shelf but you have to ask for it. Otherwise you will get the cheap stuff. My favorite were the Mojitos with Bacardi. The Pina Coladas with Malibu coconut flavored rum was also very good. The beer was very good also. We tipped the bartender a dollar about every other drink. We took a taxi for $5 each way to Playa Del Carmen on a few different nights. We found a great place for dinner called Fusion on 6th St (about 2 blocks toward the water from where 6th St. and 5th Avenue intersect.) They actually have tables right on the beach. You couldn't top the atmosphere. Everything was lit up real nicely. They had a Reggie band and the food was good and reasonably priced. You should get into Playa Del Carmen at least once or you will have missed out. At the time of our trip, you get at least 11.75 pesos per U.S. dollar. It is often a little cheaper than paying for things in dollars. About a third of the places will charge you as if the US dollar was only worth 10 pesos (ex. The taxies into P.D.C. are $5 or 50 pesos. If you exchange some of your money ahead of time you can buy 50 pesos for about $4.20 or so) The resort has an Internet room you can use for 25 pesos or $2.50 for 35 minutes. You buy an access code @ the gift shop. By the way the gift shop on several occasions didn't seem to want to give you change so use small bills and insist on getting your change unless you don't mind. For 13 nights leaving from Newark New Jersey including insurance, taxes, the transfers from the airport we paid $2,515 total for the both of us plus about $100 in tips. We thought it was a great deal, and had an excellent time. If you are not impressed at first, wait a day or two and see if you start liking it better like we did.", "Date": "May 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax", "Title": "\u201cIgnore the haters, just go for it\u201d", "Author": "YHZ", "ReviewID": "UR63821494", "Content": "(sigh)\u2026it\u2019s still amazing at what people will find to complain about. Me and my wife paid a little over $2000 and headed down for the last week of April to the Maya. In short, a great trip, loads of memories, and a great buy for the money spent. Here\u2019s our take on our trip: Flight: A little cramped as I\u2019m guessing the airline puts one more row on the plane to maximize space usage but for the most part my knees and my back survived the 4.5 hour trip from NS. It was just after exam time so there were a few \u201cjoyous\u201d students on the plane but they definitely kept their celebrating to a dull road (c\u2019mon, you\u2019re going down to a tropical country, loosen up a little bit). Food on the flight down was pretty good (we didn\u2019t eat on the way back as it was a red-eye). Room: At the Maya there are three buildings 1000-series, 2000-series, and 3000-series. The 1000 and 2000 are in the vicinity of the mail pool/main bar/beach while the 3000 is close to the quiet pool and gym. Originally, we were put in a 3000-series room, we did notice a somewhat musty smell (described as wet beach towels); however, the room had been updated and was very clean. We spent one night there and requested a room change the next morning. The room change worked very well, we weren\u2019t allowed to move our stuff until 2PM which was fine, but we were allowed to have a look at the room to ensure we were happy with it (which we definitely were, we moved to the 2000 building and got a great view of the action). The 2000-series room was had been partially updated and was very clean, we were more concerned about the location though (how much time do you really spend in your room anyway?). Food: There\u2019s 3 a-la-cartes in the Maya which you can book in advance as well as 3 a-la-cartes you can use at the sister resort, the Azteca (walking distance down the road), which you can book the day of. We did the Asian and Italian at the Azteca, and the Mexican and Mediterranean at the Maya. My fav was definitely the Mexican (being in Mexico I wasn\u2019t\u2019 surprised). Overall, the a-la-cartes were good, we recognized we\u2019re not paying top dollar so we were happy with the food and service. The main buffet was good, the fresh made doughnuts at brekkie and fresh fajitas at lunch were awesome. I also developed an addiction to the fresh-made guacamole down there\u2026mmmmmm. The food was plentiful and hot, the servers regularly came by with a few cerveza\u2019s, and it was never crowded, what more do you want? A particular favourite of ours was the snack bar down by the main pool. There would be a few times when we missed the meal times at the main buffet but we knew we could count on getting hotdogs, hamburgers, pizza, and chilli-cheese fries (a favourite) during the day. The close-by food also staves off a hangover from the generously-poured drinks at the bar. Pools: The main pool was definitely the hub of activity. As I said earlier, there were a few students kicking around so it could get raucous but not to the point that it would mess with your own chi. If you want beach chairs around the pool, snag them early as they get snapped up pretty quick. Come 12PM the pool bar would open up to keep you hydrated. The quiet pool was our little oasis away from the main pool. It got pretty windy the last three days and because of the location of the quite pool it makes for a comfortable atmosphere. There\u2019s also never really any line ups at the poolside bar which is a definite plus. Beach: AWESOME! If you\u2019re up by 8AM you\u2019ll have no problem grabbing a beach hut in a good spot on the beach. Vendors are not allowed on the beach but you will have to work with the resort staff who are running events throughout the day (i.e. aqua-aerobics, dancing lessons). Some of them are annoyingly persistent even if you say no. The quickest way to have them move on is to just sign-up but not attend if you don\u2019t want to participate (kind of evil I know, but it worked). It got really windy the last three days which forced us off the beach to either the main or quiet pools. Bars: Booze was plentiful (the mojito\u2019s and banana-mama\u2019s were my choice) and never ran out (I read one review that one bar ran short\u2026I had a hard time believing that). I can\u2019t stress this enough: for the love of Darwin bring your own insulated travel mug. Bigger servings and things are kept cool while you\u2019re out and about swimming. Excursion: We did Coba, absolutely perfect day. Jungle hike, zip-line, rapelling, cenote swimming (best part), Mayan ceremony, traditional Mayan Lunch, and finishing with 120 steps up the pyramid at Coba. We booked through our vacation representative for about $240USD, you can book at the little market across the road as well as the Wal-Mart in Playa del Carmen for a little cheaper but I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s the same tour operator. Playa del Carmen: This is getting long-winded so I\u2019m going to be brief here: Take a $5 cab ride down to 5th Avenue, loads of stuff to see and buy. Get used to saying \u201cno gracias\u201d a lot.

This was our first time here, however, it was the second time for the two other families traveling with us. First off, we didn't take the bus from the airport. We paid a taxi van to take us to the hotel. 9 of us fit comfortably in the van. The driver even took us to a store to buy beer/drinks instead of wasting lots of cash at the airport. The taxi was a relief after having a somewhat long 4 hour flight. We weren't in the mood to wait for the hotel bus. This hotel is almost at the end of the line, meaning you could be stopping to drop off lots of other people making the bus ride almost 2 hours. This was proved on our way back home as we took the bus! The strip the hotel is on is beautiful. Its surrounded by some amazing landscapes and some other very fine hotels. You get the impression you're in good company, with the amazing Riu hotel right next door. Despite the glamor of the Riu, our hotel did not disappoint. It was very clean and well maintained right from the front gate. Check-in was a breeze and we were immediately brought to our room. Here's my first tip, try to stay in the 3000-series rooms. We had 3113 and my in-laws had 3111, both were exceptional. Central air, large LCD TV, jacuzzi hot tub (this was a major plus), and the beds were VERY comfortable. The view was off the garden area and adult pool, not the ocean. We learned that the ocean view rooms were not as nice, older, had old air conditioners (meaning the thing is loud and runs all the time). So I guess thats your trade-off. Service (staff) were VERY VERY friendly. They are always happy to serve you with a smile and always say hi. On the bus ride home we heard complaints from others that the staff at their hotel were miserable. What a shame because the staff really make the stay that much more enjoyable. We had 3 kids with us, between 11-13. There are a number of things for the kids to do, however, I wouldn't say they could be occupied all day with activities specific to them. More like a bunch of 1-2 hour games/activities. As for the safety of your kids, I felt the resort over-all was safe enough for our kids to wonder around as a group. Here's my second tip - get up somewhat early and get a bunch of seats by the pool so that you can spend the day as a group poolside and always have your kids in sight. The pool itself is quite big and proved to be the best place for us to hang out, however, to really enjoy it you need to be poolside so you can get a little shade under the umbrellas. There is a snack-bar and bar right next to the pool so you can literally spend your whole day there. I won't comment on the food because frankly its just too much of a personal deal. There was always enough to eat and the kids never complained, so I guess that's what counts. I'm sure others have mentioned it, but there is an Italian, a Mexican, and a Mediterranean restaurant that you can book reservations for. While the food isn't all that much better than the buffet, it offers a great setting and some nice relax time with the family or friends. As for other guests... I'm told by the resort there is about a 50% mix of Canadians, about 30% Americans, and the rest from Europe. We met a lot of nice people and had some great conversations. As we've traveled before, we didn't bother with any excursions. Which, frankly, was the one annoying part of the trip. EVERYONE is trying to sell you an excursion or time share. Sadly, some of the folks trying to sell you the deal would get rude if you brush them off. If you decide to look outside the resort, especially down on 5th Avenue, be forewarned everything is expensive and there is a LOT of counterfeit goods there. Don't trust any booze or cigars unless you get it at the airport. Same goes for sunglasses, sportswear, etc. Mucho fake! That said, there is some real authentic Mexican food in town and we took a couple nights out to try the local stuff. Sure, there is a McDonald's and Burger King in town, but we went for a couple small places. Both were very good and despite our concerns, they were VERY clean and cautious in the way they prepared food. I got the impression they don't mess around and don't want to risk making anyone sick. Word would definitely get around and kill their business. In fact the one restaurant we went to was owned and managed by a former Ruth Chris Steak House manager. He spoke perfect English and re-assured us they take great care in food preparation. With that out of the way we enjoyed some great local specialties. Quickly, a couple other things we tried. I got my wife and daughter Swedish massages, they were apparently very good. For kids (11 in my case), they can do a half hour massage instead of a full hour. They loved it. Brings lots of sunscreen as the sun is more intense here this time of year than anywhere else I've been. It was a constant 34-36 everyday. Also, bring BUGSPRAY. At night in town we got our legs bitten a hundred times while sitting at dinner. Those little mosquito's are just as bad down there as they are here during camping season, if not worse. Trust me, the bugspray will be worth its weight it gold. WIFI is everywhere here, a major disappointment was that they didn't mention it. Would have been good to be able to bring the laptop for the kids to keep up on Facebook and for us to check the hockey scores and search for nightlife recommendations while down there. Bring a little laptop, you'll be glad you did. Over-all we were very impressed with the hotel and amenities, and the impeccable landscaping. We can see why our family came back again.

We were traveling with three other couples and my boyfriend and I seemingly got the \"best\" room of the four and still: ROOM - there was mold covering the ceiling - there was only conditioner in the shower (we asked for shampoo and soap but never recevied it) - our alarm clock did not work (but none of our friends even HAD one) - the lamps in our room did not work - there was paint splattered all over the mirror of our dresser (again, a few of our friends didn't even HAVE dressers) - the toilet seat was not installed properly and would rest on you back while using the toilet...that felt pretty nice when using the bathroom in a bathing suit - we tipped everyday but some days we got towels, some days we didn't, some days we got water, some days we didn't SERVICE: The front desk staff at this resort are vicious; completely uncaring, rude, rolling their eyes with every request you make, hanging up on you mid sentence. By the end I was afraid to ask them for anything! And, even if you do ask, no one ever helps you with anything. They practically yell at you for asking. The staff that makes the restaurant reservations are no better - rude, acting as though you're hasseling them. The bartenders and wait staff are fantastic! Always smiling, asking if you need anything, going above and beyond the call of duty. Also, the spa staff is wonderful. My boyfriend and I had a couples massage on the beach...it was all great except for the fact that the massage hut is RIGHT beside a scuba rental place and the crowds there can get VERY noisy...not the best place for a peaceful massage. FOOD: Nothing to rave about. I am not a terribly picky eater so I could always find something I liked. The Italian restaurant at the Maya (sister resort) was fair, the Mediteranean restaurant the the Viva was awful, but the Mexican restaurant at the Viva was the best! Everything the set in front of us there was delicious. Another couple with us also went to the Mayan restaurant at the Maya resort and said it was great. The drinks were delicious - try the mango daquiri!! LOCATION: Amazing location! Playa del Carmen is beautiful, a quick ferry ride to Cozumel (incredible snorkeling), $5 cab or 20 minute walk into the town, lots to see and do. Best of all is the beach! White sand, perfectly kept shore front, bright blue water, it was the highlight of the trip. We spent almost ALL of our time on the beach in lawnchairs, on the beach beds, playing volley ball, or in the water. All in all we made the best of this trip but I would not go back to a Viva resort or recommend it to my friends. However, I would DEFINITELY go back to Playa del Carmen in a heart beat!", "Date": "April 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "BC", "Title": "\u201cDont stay here!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "sherrydougsmom", "ReviewID": "UR62706531", "Content": "Hello All, I am writing thi review on day three of my holiday. I read the reviews before I booked here and decided that perhaps people were being too critical. WRONG!!!! I am so disappointed with this resort and I will never come back. Cleanliness - not bad the staff try hard. It seems to be an older resort. I found mould around the bathroom door. Service - not great - not even good. It is hard to get a drink at the bars at the best of time. I FORGOT to eave a tip for the maid this morning and the beds were barely made. I had previously left $3 per day as well as trinkets for the room cleaners. Location - $5 taxi ride gets you to anywhere in Playa. The beaches are beautiful and the water is gorgeous. We spent $3000+ for this trip (3 of us) I do not believe I got good value for my money. I am sorry I wasted my money - for the same amount I know I could have gotten much better. FOOD - Yuck! There is one buffet restaurant and the food has been the same everyday. The only difference between breakfast and lunch is you can not get pasta at breakfast and you can not get eggs at lunch. Linch and dinner is almost exactly the same - different decorations. We thought we would go over to the sister hotel to try the buffet there - NOPE not allowed only ala carte. Ala carte is well booked in advance - if you do come boo the day you get here for your dinner choices (limited to 3 per week) The service in the restaurant is not great and yes we tipped the servers. The \"chefs\" ho prepare the meals in the restaraunt area work really hard and I have yet to see anyone tip them. Rooms - very small and sparse. No mini bar, no fridge, no coffee, no dressers, small TV, no face clothes or hand towels, no soap, mould an bathroom door, air conditioner broke. One bottle of water per day ( 3 in room) (went to wal-mart to buy face clothes and water) Sleep Quality - there is none! When I read about the hard beds I chuckled, thinking the reviewer MUST have been a bit on the dramatic side. NOT SO! The beds are like sleepng on concrete with a thin (very this) mattress. I have never slept in any hotel (not even the cheap ones) with such bad mattresses. The cot we had to beg for is old and lumpy and has a bad smell to it. I have asked several times for some remedy to the issues but only recieve promises of \"I will check into it.\" Perhaps if the sleep was better the often things would not seem so bad or be a little more tolerable.

We have stayed at two Vivas before this one and I have to say that this resort has major problems. When we got to our rooms, we asked for an alarm clock, an extra blanket, two pillows, and washcloths which were absent from the bathroom. We only had 3 towels and asked for 3 more. We received two pillows right away, but not the other items. Not a big deal. Maybe just didn't have the other items on hand? Followed up at the front desk at dusk and they said they would have somebody run it up right away. Nope, not even the towels. I used a wet already used towel to dry off with the first night. Again, not that big of a deal. We didn't get the blanket or alarm clock in our 6 day trip we were there. The alarm clock was addressed by asking for a wake up call when we needed to wake up for our excursion. Fair enough, we used the wake up call and it came 35 minutes late! Thanks to our son's mp3 player having a clock wer were able to be on time. The washcloths only came two days later! I was discusted by the service in the reservation only restaurants also. I was served raw chicken in one of them, and had some piece of metal in the other meal that I ate in the other restaurant. I am a chef of 23 years and have never seen such bad customer service in my life. The restaurants that are reservation only are never full and you are told you can only go to two of them. What? Why? They don't fill them to begin with! That mistifies me. At the snack bar, they serve wood fired pizza. Good pie until they try to serve you the old stuff thay was left over from the prior service in the hot box. It was burnt and dry!!!! I asked Geramides (My Guy) to get me some fresh that was coming out of the oven and the female server that served the other crap got mad at me. I was supposed to be having a good time, but the circustances were preventing me to do so. I pulled the kitchen crew together including the Chef of the staition and read them the riot act. Guess what, not one appology was given. WOW! I took the pizza to the property manager to complain again to him. He was appologetic and said he would take care of it. I had to become furious and take it to the next level everytime I had an issue with anything. Even the excursion director dismissed my problems like I was wasting her time and go to the other line with 9 other guests in line. We ran into a couple that had to stay at The Reef because the Vivas (plural) couldn't fit them in because they overbooked the resort. There are two Vivas within walking distance of each other and this signals mismanagement of people, services, and resorces. The activities are organized but listen to this one! We were playing volleyball with the score 14 to 15. Exactly at 5 pm when we were supposed to stop playing, the activity girl snatched the ball and told us that we were done. We pleaded to finish the game (1more point or so cause you have to win by 2) and she said her boss would get mad if she showed up late beacuse she let us finish. Again, what kind of customer service is this? The bussers and bartenders are the best people in the resort. Every other service aspect was dredfull! I wouldn't go there if had any other choices available to me and my family. Bad, bad, bad! The views are great, but there are literally hundreds of resorts on the same stretch of beach to choose from. Don't waste your time and hard earned money to go to this resort. They don't care about you and your needs near enough to make it worth it.

Many people trying to get you to buy tours and souveniers. Kinda annoying but they are trying to make a living too so I politely just said \"no, gracias\" Booked a tour to Coba.

We also read some negative ones as well which seem just plain silly to us now after staying there for a week. Before I go any further, please realize that this is a family resort so if you are like me and don't care for children, you might look elsewhere. But if you can deal with it (as I did) you will be fine. FOOD: This was our first all-inclusive trip and I wasn't sure how it would work. I was a little concerned about certain things, starting with making restaurant reservations. It was actually pretty easy to eat at any of them--we made our 3 reservations the morning of our second day. Yes, you are only allowed 3 reservations while there which might be a problem for some. But in reality there is enough variety at the buffet that 3 restaurant trips were plenty. We ate at Don Diego, Portofino, and Bamboo (at the Azteca). All had great atmospheres and very friendly service. Don Diego had excellent Mexican food and was our favorite. I would recommend going to Bamboo as well; the Azteca was very nice and gave us a different place to have a drink. As for the buffet, it is what it is. The food was not bad by any means--don't miss the Mexican theme night--but you won't get a gourmet meal. They were usually pretty busy but we were never left standing, and they never ran out of anything, another negative we read on other reviews. If you think you are a food connoisseur you probably won't be impressed by any of the food served, but if you are just going for a good time and don't want to starve, you won't be disappointed. ROOMS: We didn't fly to Mexico for a week to spend all of our time in a hotel room, so I have no complaints. Yes, the walls are a little thin and you could hear folks walking past the door. I prefer to sleep in a room with a fan or A/C duct near the bed, and these rooms could feel a little stuffy. But if you take advantage of the all-inclusive bar service as we did, you shouldn't have trouble falling asleep anyway! I also must say that the showers were great, I would love to have that shower in my home. Other reviews mention the lack of hand towels and washcloths which was true--we only had those on one day--but that was hardly a problem. Dry your hands on the big towels and soap up with your hands, you will be fine. SERVICE: Service was great all-around. When our shuttle pulled up, we were greeted by a bellhop who happily took our bags and walked us to the front desk. We were immediately checked in and given our room keys, along with a welcome drink. The bellhop took us to our room and gave us a verbal tour on the way, letting us know where everything was. The chambermaids did a great job of cleaning the rooms, as well as leaving a folded towel animal on the bed each day, which was one of our favorite things to see each time the room was cleaned. Bar service was top-notch. I have never had more friendly and prompt service from a bar here in the USA. We tipped most of the time but you will be treated just as well if you don't ever leave a tip. Each day, on our second trip to the same bartender, we were asked if we wanted two more of what we just had. They always remembered and were happy to make what you wanted no matter how complicated or simple the drink was, and always garnished it. Make sure you ask for top-shelf liquor if you desire and they will use it; otherwise they will use the cheap stuff. As for restaurant service, it was always very friendly and prompt. At the buffet, they will bring you drinks and clean your table off in a very timely manner. The cooks who make your pasta, or carve your meat, or make your omelet, always take care of you. The miscellaneous service, such as the grounds crew, beach towel service, etc, were also great. They work very hard to keep the entire area looking good. If you are an early riser you will see someone out clipping hedges, watering the grass, touching up paint, etc. early each morning. ENTERTAINMENT: If you get bored easily laying on the beach drinking all the tropical drinks you can handle (not sure if that is possible), you will always have plenty to do here. There is a large group of entertainers that made it very fun. During the day they try very hard to get everyone involved in all of the available activities. For some, this could be a problem--you might get annoyed if you are sleeping on a beach chair around 10:00 am when they start making their rounds. But if you aren't too uptight it is no problem. You might actually want to join the \"Crazy Beach Game\", or try the aqua aerobics, step aerobics, yoga, Salsa/Meringue lessons, beach volleyball, water polo, bingo, etc. You can also head to the water-sports hut around 9 am when they start lending boogie boards, kayaks, windsurfing equipment, and snorkeling equipment. Be there at 2:00 when they start giving catamaran rides--I highly recommend this. Also available, which we wanted to try but weather limited our options, is a circus trapeze they have set up near the stage. They do two sessions each day, one for children and one for adults, where you can take a shot at doing a trapeze act. Looked like a rush! At night (9:30), the entertainers put on a show at the main stage. The emcee is funny and engaging and the shows were pretty good, although I am not a guy that cares for plays/stage shows. But it gives you an option if you don't want to sit at the bar for a while. The discotheque upstairs was kind of fun as well once it opened at 11:00 each night. All in all, for 90% of us normal people, this is a great resort. Ample food, great friendly service, and a great price. Couldn't ask for anything more. But again, if you prefer to eat like a king in a more private setting with no kids around for miles, you may find this to be below your standards.", "Date": "April 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201c3 Star Food, 4 Star Everything Else\u201d", "Author": "Dream89", "ReviewID": "UR61698840", "Content": "Stayed 10 days at the end of March with another family, 3 kids 10-12 yrs old, they loved it....except for the buffet which was a typical Mexican Buffet same things every day.

We got a room in the 2000 block (right side of the pool as you face the Ocean) 2nd floor with a balcony (only enough room for 2 chairs and a small table) Ocean view, it was great in the morning and at night to sit out there. I called ahead about 3 weeks before and asked for a room in the 2000 block as close as possible to the pool which is what we got but not sure if we just lucked out. Room itself was very dated but clean, bring extra close hangers there's no dresser's in the older rooms. The nightly outdoor show stage is also close the pool, holds about 300-500 people. Some previous reviews say don't get a room close to the Stage because it's loud at night, I wouldn't say it's that loud but the show runs from 9-10:30pm so we weren't exactly trying to sleep at 10:00pm or even in the room for that matter. The shows were put on by the same people that run the daily Pool and Beach entertainment but you wouldn't guess that if you didn't see them during the day. I give them big time credit for what they do, it's not excatly a Vegas show but it's pretty good for performers who also have a full time day job, and it's a different theme every night. There's a kids (up to about 13 yrs old) competition on stage every night before the main show that ours guys did every night, they loved it. The staff really try to get to know the kids and get them to join in on things. Kids loved the freedom there too, the place is small enough that they could rome freely and you didn't worry about them. Pool wasn't huge, not allot of chairs around it so you had to get up by 7am to get a good spot, same with the Beach palapa's, 5:30am to get front row but this isn't uncommon at most resorts in Mexico. Pool Canteena food?.....take a guess. The one thing this place could have used is some night entertainment in their outdoor lobby bar which was a great center piece, big, and cozy. The Disco opened at 11pm but it was your typical 80's decorated round Disco full of 18 year old Vanilla Ice wanna be's. Walked to Playacar Golf Course and played 18, kids under 12 play free if with a payed Adult. Great course, includes Sandwiches and Beer...lots of Beer, they come around every 2 holes and fill your cart. Oh ya, they had Wifi which we even got in the room but it was 150 pesos for 5 hrs.

I must say, though, that travellers need to keep in mind that this is a 3-star hotel, not a 5. So clearly, do not expect a 5-star hotel and you will not be disappointed. Check-in: Quick and easy. They take a deposit for the room and towels(used on the beaches) upon check-in with a credit card, so just be aware that if you lose a towel key you will be charged! Room: I had a room in one of the newly refurbished buildings, in section 1000. (Room 1224 to be precise.) It was VERY clean and comfy. The bed was a little stiff for my liking, but it was just fine. This building was in great proximity to everything, the snackbar, beach, pool, etc. The ONLY thing I did not like about this building is that it was directly accross from the theater, which played very loud music for their shows at night between 9 and 11 p.m. This didn't bother me the whole time, but when I had to wake up early for my excursions the next day it was a bit irritating. So, I would suggest if you have little children who need their sleep or if you mind noise around those hours of the night, try to get a room in another building. Food: Great! I am a very picky eater and I could always find food at the buffet that I liked. The ala carte restaurants were all very good. I wasn't too impressed with the Mexican restaurant, but the Meditteranean and Italian restaurants were AMAZING! Great display of food, very tasteful and good serving portions. ** I would HIGHLY suggest that once you check-in you go to the reservation desk and book the ala carte restaurants. They book EXTREMLY quickly and most of the people we heard from did not get reservations at a single one their entire stay ** Staff: VERY friendly, hard workers..especially the landscapers. They are constantly cleaning! They really work hard and depend greatly on tips, so tip when you can! $1 USD goes a long way considering $1 USD=$12.80 pesos! Entertainment: Eh, it wasn't something I was too interested in, but the few bits and pieces of the shows I caught weren't too entertaining to me. They do try hard to entertain, though.The entertainment staff are constantly combing the beach for people to do activities, which I liked. They had stuff going on all day like dance lessons, aerobics, etc. Beach: Beautiful! It wasn't 100% turquoise once you entered the ocean..but it didn't bother me. A bit of the coral and sand was stirred up so I'm guessing that's why it was a little cloudy. It was still very relaxing and I always found a lounge chair. They have kayaks and surf boards and windsurfing on the beach which was nice, as well. The alcohol definitely wasn't watered down, the food was plentiful and delicious and the beach was great! What more can you ask for? It was a great value for the money I paid and I'd go there again. It was in great proximity to many of the excursions I did, and a $5 cab ride into town. I HIGHLY recommend doing the excursion \"Edventure tours.\" We were out all day from 7:45am to 6pm for $102 USD. The groups are nice and small. We went ziplining, cenote (underwater cave) snorkeling, saw the Mayan ruins, went to a giant lagoon for more snorkeling, a great restaurant(not included) and they also have something where you can swim with sea turtles! Their website is http://www.edventuretours.com.mx/ I also went to Xcaret which is an ecological park, and that was also great! Book Viva! It's a great value!", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "newport news, va", "Title": "\u201cNot the greatest, but not the worst place I have stayed\u201d", "Author": "pati53", "ReviewID": "UR61290741", "Content": "My husband and I have traveled to Mexico numerous times, and I think this will be the last.

Buffet, restaurant and activity staff were friendly, accommodating, helpful and overall wonderful. Rooms Our room was right on the beach and we loved the location. The room itself was nothing special but we liked the bed and the pillows. Never heard a sound from neighbouring rooms (and the resort was full). Had a great sleep every night. Cleaning staff did a very good job (we left tips daily). Nice animal towel art and flowers left in our room. Plumbing (tub drainage, etc.) worked very slowly. Maybe because of all the sand washed down the drain. We had a dresser with drawers, but our kids room only had shelves. Can\u2019t comment on the TV because we never turned it on. Some things seemed a little silly: stingy with toilet tissue - we actually had to call the front desk for more because they didn\u2019t leave a new roll if the roll in place had any left on it. It was hit and miss with the size and quantity of towels provided every day. Only one bottle of water was left in our room each day, so we learned to go to the bar and fill our jugs with purified water for brushing teeth, etc. Food Buffet was good; we could always find something we liked. Lots to choose from at all meals. Staff were extremely pleasant and helpful when getting drinks, clearing the tables, etc. Not much variety in fruit selection, but it was plentiful enough. Juice tasted like it was fresh squeezed. Lots of pop, beer, wine, etc. available in the buffet. We liked the Mediterranean restaurant the best, although all three were OK. Poolside snack bar was convenient. Fruit, pizza, hot dogs, nachos, french fries, etc. Food available nearly 24 hours a day either at the snack bar or cafeteria. Resort overall We wanted a small resort and were basically pleased with this one. Location is great - directly across the street from a nice little mall (Starbucks has wifi); close to Playa del Carmen: walking distance on the beach, or a quick taxi ride to 5th Avenue. Gated community - we felt perfectly safe. We enjoyed the relaxing pool. Lots of beach walking opportunities. Our kids enjoyed archery, wind surfing lessons, used the boogie boards, etc. Exercise classes are pretty tame, but I guess you can\u2019t expect much more when participants are in bikinis and bare feet. Night Life - Bars The bar staff were good (even better if you tipped). No two drinks turned out the same, but we didn\u2019t mind. We were disappointed with the nightly entertainment. Choreographed dance routines with outdated themes (Madonna?) and poor lip syncing. (Although the one show featuring acrobatic acts was good.) No other nightlife to speak of. We would have preferred more real entertainment (dance band, etc.), but would likely need to go to a larger resort for that. Our kids (24 and 21) enjoyed the disco and had a great time with other young adults. Recommendation Perfectly fine as long as a luxurious room is not your main vacation criteria. (we really didn't care since all we did was sleep in it) . It\u2019s not a 5 star, but then again, we didn\u2019t pay a 5 star price either. We were lucky; the weather was beautiful the full week we were there. There was enough to do, and lots of time to do nothing but lie on the beach and read a book if we wanted. We were never hungry or thirsty or bored. The grounds are beautifully maintained and the beach made it all worth while.

They asked us to wait a little while and were able to make the change (by 2:30pm!) We were there during a very busy time from March 29 - April 5th. The rooms were basic, but had everything we needed. The fridge was stocked daily and we had beautiful towel animals daily from our maid. The beds were hard, but we always slept pretty well due to being out in the sun all day. The best part of the hotel was the animation staff. They made sure that everyone was involved (if they wanted to be). I did the water aerobics, step-aerobics, & dance. My kids played volleyball, football, daily trapeze time, soccer and archery. They all had an amazing time. We also used the boogie boards, sailboats and booked a snorkling tour through the dive shop (only thing we paid for at the hotel). Breakfast was yummy (especially the fresh made doughnuts!) Lunch was usually by the pool. It was mostly the same stuff daily, but was all very good. Loved the chips & guacamole. Dinner was usually ok -- my picky daughter always had pasta and salad.

To sum it up overall we were pleased, had a relaxing vacation, received our moneys worth and would go back. Couples, families, teens and kids. Flight - Will try to avoid Sunwing next time as they were 2 hrs late and the plane is terribly cramped, bring a book cause the movie didn't work very well both ways it was something like an old cinema flick, not something you would normally watch, the food was not bad though .. Made for a very long 5 1/2 hr flight. Arrived at 2330 at night. Resort and Room - Nice, small and compact resort, in a secure gated community, need to show security your bracelet when coming and going by Taxi. Beautiful grounds, very clean. Downward incline from lobby to beach and upwards coming back. We requested bldg 1000 and that is where we were on the 3rd floor with a view of the beach and a 2 minute walk to our chairs and a 3 minute walk to the lobby and buffet. This is the renovated bldg. The 3rd floor has vault ceilings which makes the room look bigger. Nothing fancy, but nice and clean, lots of room for 2. Only 1 sm bottle of water in room, asked every day for more water and some pop, never received any, so bought our own at the store, yes we tipped every day. Nice towel art and room clean. Plus was we could sit on our balcony and watch show at night. Rooms not paper thin, however depends on your neighbours, doors close very loudly. Service - Service was hit and miss, I believe it depends on the person you're requesting it from. Front staff not overly attentive at any time, felt like we were an inconvenience. Waiters and waitresses extremely friendly all the time, bar staff, again depends on the person. Extremely hard working staff, we have never seen buffet staff working so fast before. Food - Breakfast always delicious, best meal of the day. Rest of buffet, OK always could find chicken, beef or pork and pasta and bread at the buffets. Breakfast opens at 6:30am. Food available almost 24hr day at the beach bar. Food at beach was OK, burgers, hot dogs, pizza and a bit more. No trouble getting reservations, didn't like the Mexican but enjoyed the Mediterranian. Resort was packed but hardly any long lineups, depends on time you are there. We ate around 8 - 8:30pm. Drink - Tried lots of drinks at the beach bar, we found most either too sweet or too much alcohol in them and most were made with slushies... maybe a good thing. Drinks were never made the same way twice. Beer was good though. Lobby bar made the better drinks. Activities and Entertainment - staff work very hard and long hours. Tonnes of activities, vollyball, water arobics, canoes, boogie boards, catamarans, pingpong, trapeeze, archery, dance lessons, etc. all day long. Great for teens and tweens, always trying to get people involved, but not too much. Saw three shows, (one from balcony) some better then others, all a matter of taste of guests. Runs from 930 - 1030. We were right next to stage and no noise after 1030 at night. The beach bar seems to be the happening place. Weather and Beach - No rain, could wake up to black sky and by 1000 clear and sunny or a few clouds. Beach was nice, very wide and long for walking. Very windy (was appreciated with 80+++ temps, but sand did not blow. Lots of chairs, although with it being Easter weekend, all were full. Water was always very wavey and choppy with winds, kids liked surfing with boogie boards on the waves and wave jumping. Drops off very quickly, unlike the beaches in Cuba (prefer Cuba beach). Need to watch smaller kids. Walked into Playa Del Carmen, 20 by beach and 10 min $5.00 by taxi. Very safe with lots of Mexican shopping nearby on 5th avenue. Good eats as well. Gives you a break from the beach. TIPS: If staying on 3rd floor take first entrance into your bldg. closest to lobby and walk down the hall to get to your room, as with the incline you will only have 2 flights of stairs instead of 6 flights at the bottom of the incline closer to the beach. Found this out on 6th day. Take sun screen as very pricy there, two clothes pins for holding your towel on chair (windy) face clothes - none there, for late return home shower in gym as you will have already checked out very nice and not busy, do apply sunscreen often, especially after in the water cause it does wash off with all the waves hitting you. We pre-tanned and still got burned on our 6th day, even with sunscreen, take aloa vera for burns it does works.

They had a pay now option that can save you quite a bit on the price. We got 3 rooms for 9 people ocean view (no real ocean front at this resort) for $91/person/day or $273/room/night. I did my research and am very familiar with the area as we vacation there often. Really wanted a deal as we were traveling with another family and have 5 teenage kids in our group. Saw a lot of so so reports on VWM so I wondered what we would get for a lower priced all inclusive. Check in We arrived at 2:30 pm on Friday March 12 and had about a 30 minute wait to get checked in. Although we still had not received bracelets all 9 of us were allowed to get drinks and food while we waited. We finally got our 3 rooms and unfortunately 1 out of the 3 rooms reeked like cigarettes. Unfortunately that was mine and my wife\u2019s room that we were sharing with our 14 year old daughter. No way were we staying in that room! Went to the front desk and found the young lady who checked us in, Elisa from Italy. She is beautiful and helped us so much. It was obvious that they were at full capacity so we knew this would not be easy. After about 20 more minutes Elisa was able to get us in a king bed rather than 2 queens and a roll away was brought in for our daughter. We were told we could switch to 2 queens the next day. Well we never had to switch as our daughter liked the roll away just fine and we were already \"moved\" in. Grade - B Rooms Rooms were spacious and very clean. great AC and all had a room safe and a stocked fridge that gets checked often. Beds were hard but I was comfortable. Only thing we noticed is the walls are paper thin and noise is a problem. Recommendation - It was definitely spring break when we were there and the Georgetown U. and Notre Dame kids were giving er pretty good. We had to sleep with ear plugs in as they stayed up 3 nights until 6 am! So.... Ask for a room either on the right or left sides of the property that face away from the inside areas (ask to face neighboring resorts instead of the bars/pool area). Our other two rooms faced out and they never heard a thing at night. Grade - B Bars Probably the best part excluding the beach of course. You could order all the top shelf booze that you wanted at no charge. even though the resort was full lines were never real bad. Bartenders were very friendly and after getting a few $1 tips service was excellent! The bar closest to the lobby specialized in martinis and although I am not a martini drinker both wives had their share and they were impressed with the top shelf vodka and quality of the drinks. I found a dark Bacardi I was fond of. Our kids all underage kept the bartenders busy with every kind of non alcoholic blender drink you can think of and busy bartenders never batted an eye. Grade- A Food Buffets were average. Something for everyone. The ladies all liked the made to order pasta bar (long line though, seriously need 2 people working here) while the guys always found enough meat to eat. Very good sushi was a big hit one night. As a rule at most buffets, breakfast was the best meal of the day. Snack bar had great potential but maybe because it was a peak week they always seemed to be out of something we wanted \u2013 pizza, guac, or chips. They never seemed to run out of burgers or hot dogs(burgers may have been horse or alligator meat as they were terrible-real funny taste). If we were hungry during mid afternoon when the snack bar was busy(3ish) we would take the 5 minute walk down to the smaller and quieter sister property Viva Wyndham Azteca. They had a much better snack bar and never ran out of the good stuff! Drinks were also easier to get. ( If you\u2019re going with out kids and you want less noise/crowds Viva Azteca would definitely be a better option as it is very nice but MUCH more laid back) They also made pepperoni pizza all the time which only showed up occasionally at the Maya. I like meat on my pizza! Reservations were hard to get for the ala cartes. I was 4th or 5th in line two days in a row and the only times or restaurants I could get were a 6 pm or 9:30 pm in the Italian or Mediterranean restaurants. We had 6 in our group( 3 teenage boys wanted nothing to do with a sit down drawn out meal) and all the others would only take reservations for only up to 4 people. We ate at the Italian one night at 9:30 pm and almost did not get in due to a mix up. When I reserved I specifically told the employee I wanted Italian at the Maya where we were staying but upon arriving they did not have a reservation for us. It seems our reservation was at the Azteca instead. I have to give Juan the manager a huge compliment because after saying no at first and then seeing the disappointment in the faces of the two teenage girls with us, he some how found a way to get us in. Food was good but the 5 courses took forever. We decided that we would cancel the next nights reservation at the Mediterranean restaurant as we did not want to commit that much time to dinner. Grade - C+ Beach Ah, coming from northern Wisconsin this is really what we go for. We normally go to Akumal and day or night trip to Playa but we heard the beach restoration was going to really improve the beaches so we thought we would give it a try. (We stayed at the Xaman Ha condos, just south of the ferry dock in PDC in 2005 and they had zero beach then!) I can verify that the beach is now so wide in the PDC/Playa car area that you need binoculars to see from the front part of the beach near the resort to the water! The sand is very nice and the water is incredible. The bluest, greenest shades I have ever seen! There is lots to do as there was always a volleyball game going on along with catamarans and kayaks we used several times. Also took advantage of the parasail shack right next door. ($60 for about 20 minutes) Lots of people and lots of activity as people were constantly walking this awesome stretch of beach both to the north toward Playa and too the south. Grade - A Entertainment Good staff, maybe a little to aggressive. All the usual as I mentioned kayaks, catamarans, volleyball. Also had goofy games, bacci ball, dance lessons etc. We were usually at the bar when the show was going on and could see and hear the shows but the only one that really drew a crowd, including our entire group of 9, was the disco show - it was very good! Grade B Pools Main pool-Gross! We would not even go in. It was always very full and we heard one of the Spring Breakers brag to her girlfriend how she had just peed in it. Also seemed to be a film on top of the water. WVM really needs a bigger or cleaner pool as I can see this as being a huge deal breaker for some families/couples. There was a small adult only pool in the back of the property that I am almost reluctant to tell about as we really enjoyed from 4 \u2013 6 pm every day. The younger crowd never found it or weren\u2019t interested as it typically only had 30 or so people and was quiet and relaxing and it had its own small tikki bar with an awesome bartender that aimed to please. Again, drinks at this place were very good. Grade- C- (small adult pool in back of property saved this grade!) Grounds Very clean and well kept. Huge court yard with lots of seating between the lobby/bar and the beach/snack bar area. One night they had a Mexican market set up with some very interesting items. Decent weight room and a trapeze with high swings/netting that the kids liked. Grade B+ Location Excellent! It was a 20 minute walk to PDC either via sidewalk or the beach. Right Across the road is a small strip mall that has some very nice Mexican arts and crafts and lots of other things including necessities. Grade A Price Are you kidding me! less than $100/night/person!! We got our money's worth. Could of stayed at many of the others on this stretch of beach for a lot more as i checked several times before booking. Grade A Overall grade- High B For the price it might even be a B+ but the pool needs to be cleaned up ( I hate to say this but more chemicals?) and the snack bar needs to keep up. Neither of these are probably even a problem except the month of March and Easter week when they are at capacity. If we go back next year which is probable if the price stays about the same, I think we will stay at the Azteca and play at the Maya. For less than $100/person/day we think we definitely got our moneys worth of food, drink, entertainment and lodging. With the restored beach this stretch of AI's in Playacar is the place to go for those looking for action, people watching and lots of activities. Playa del Carmen is a 20 minute walk or $5 taxi ride away. We love staying at the ABR but decided that with 5 teens in tow they would be extremely board especially at night. We day tripped to Akumal and checked things out on our way to Tulum and we are sure glad we stayed nead PDC as the ABR looked near empty. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask any questions. The second part of our trip was for four days right on the beach in Tulum in a private villa we rented.", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nevada", "Title": "\u201cGood for the value, remember you paid for 3 star not 5 star!\u201d", "Author": "Marci3335", "ReviewID": "UR60442232", "Content": "Reading the negative reviews, I'm thinking, were we at the same place?

The check-in process, was just ok, not as welcoming as some of the other AI resorts we've been to, the Guest Services always had a long line with only one person working, but that's no big deal.

They make great Latte's and cappucino's at the lobby bar.

The water polo games could get loud, but I thought it was fun to watch, and my son loved playing! The avitivity staff was great, friendly, and kept my kids busy all week, remembered their names, etc. If you're looking for quiet, the adult pool, next to the 3000 building was very quiet, mellow, with a very friendly bartender, there are lots of options here! We walked down to Viva Azteca, loved their outside bar, and thought their pizza was better, and their buffet was very good. We are glad we didn't book here though because most of their activiites were for adults, not kids, the kids looked bored. At the end of the trip my husband and I both agreed that we would recommend it to a friend for a good, clean, fun, value hotel with a beautiful beach!

That is ridiculous to charge guests for stupid pool towels. I complained, and said so basically what you're telling me is that I either pay $20- or go steal someone elses towel???

No wastebasket in the bathroom. No tubs. The exception is the 3000 building (to which we moved the 2nd night). It is quiet. They have tubs but only a half wall btwn the bathroom and the bedroom w/ wooden shutters on it. Ours were missing several slats so I had to tell my son \"not to look\" every time I took a shower. There are cardboard quality doors btwn the hotel rooms. You can literally here everything that's happening next door. Awkward! The beach: It is beautiful. However all the cabana's at this resort have ashtrays nailed to them and the beach is littered w/ cigarette butts. The ambiance: Drunk, loud, young adults. Cigarette smoke EVERYWHERE. Did not feel comfortable sending my kids anywhere unaccompanied. The food: ranged from solidly mediocre to \"spit out in your napkin\" bad. The staff: rudest staff I have ever encountered, period. We paid full rack rate. I am in the process of complaining to Wyndham. Will let you know how they respond!", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cMemorable\u201d", "Author": "WavebabyEdmonton", "ReviewID": "UR60204760", "Content": "The Viva Wyndham Maya exceeded our expectations.

I had read comments on here about the 3000 building being noisey. . . I'm surprised, my sister and I were in the 3000 building and had we not seen people walking around in there, we would have thought we were the only ones in the building. It was so quite and they moved us into a room with a fantastic view of a pool. For excursions, go and see Domingo on the beach, he set us up with some great excursions and for much less than Sunwing (the very same ones that they offered). The food was good and there was such a wide variety. . . for all preferences. Some nights we found a lot of the meat choices a little salty but that was pretty much it! The fresh fruit and omlettes were scrumptious. The beach? Wow! Spectacular! Breath taking! You can easily walk to 5th ave from here.

When you can make a reservation, you are allowed to make only 2 at a time. They are mediocre at best. The buffet is always crowded and running out of food.The bus staff is great. The rooms are clean. No beach activities after 4.They will take the volley ball from you mid game. I tried to switch rooms because of noise issue and were told, sorry , none avail. Friends of ours do not have clock in their room! When asked they were told that They were booked full and none will be avail until someone leaves.

We were there from March 12th to the 26th. We arrived late in the day, about 9:50PM and check in was very fast, the buffet closed at 10 and they said if we wanted to eat that they would take our bags to the rooms. The rooms are plain but adequate, not many drawers but we managed easily. Our room was quite humid so on the second day we asked for a dehumidifier and in 15 minutes it was there, we also asked for more pillows and again, within 15 minutes they were there. The beds were firm, but not nearly as hard as at the Barcelo hotel we stayed at on the Riveria Maya 3 years ago. There have been reviews about hearing your neighbors, we never heard the adjacent rooms but you can hear everything that goes on in the hallway. The maid service was excellent, our rooms were spotless, they even washed the windows everyday. We left $2 for the maid each day and in 14 days we had 12 different amazing towel arts when we got back to our rooms. The buffets were OK, we could always find good things to eat, some was not steaming hot but a good selection. I really miss hot, fresh donuts and their homemade Ice cream. The staff was great, very friendly and quick with the coffee pot. A special thanks to Moises, always a smile on his face. We ate at 5 of the ala cartes, they have 6, 3 here and 3 at their sister hotel the Viva Wyndham Axteca, a 4 minute walk away. The food there was excellent, very tasty and excellent service. I had no problem making reservations as I am always up early, you can book a reservation at 8 AM and there was never more than 2 of us there at that time. There is a beach snack bar that is beside the pool bar, open from 11 AM to 6 PM and then again from 11 PM to 6 AM. We don't drink so no bar review, it never seemed like too much of a line up. The pool looked nice and was always busy, we are beach people so we didn't do the pool either. As someone has mentioned on here, all the pool area is stone or tile and is VERY slippery when wet so walk cautiously. The beach is amazing, the hotel is right up against the beach so you don't have to walk far to get to the beach. We could walk as far as we could walk along the beach and couldn't see the end of the beach which is very cool. They rebuilt the beach a couple of months ago and with the wave action, which there was quite a bit of, the water is not crystal clear right off shore. Probably the highlight of the hotel was the activity staff, they do all the activities as well as the stage show at 9:30 PM, long days, 6 days a week starting at 9:30 AM. They were all wonderful, always visiting and trying to get us involved, Madeline, from Australia, was a special treat. She got us involved in a number of activities as well as being a great dancer in the evening show. The evening shows were all fun, the staff works very hard on them. I was always on the beach early, not as early as the group from Atlantic Canada who would be on the beach at 5 AM everyday to watch the sun come up but I was usually there by 6:30. The loungers in the front row were usually full by 7;30 but there always seemed to be some available somewhere. The beach is busy, so if you are looking for a quiet beach, this may not be the place for you. They have an adults only pool at the other end of the resort which is quiet. They also have a trapeze by the pool and a very talented staff teaching people the trapeze. The grounds are small as this is not a huge hotel but they were immaculate, staff was always busy working on them. The hotel is a 20 minute walk to Playa del Carmen which we did several times, very handy. There is a mall right accross the street which has souvenirs that a comparable price to in town. We booked one excursion to Coba, otherwise we were at the beach each day. If you want to go to Coco Bongo, you can book at the hotel cheaper than at Coco Bongo and they get you there and back as well as having one or more of the activity staff as a VIP tour guide. We had a very good time at this hotel, it has a great location, is very clean with exceptional staff. Remember folks, this is a 3 or 3 1/2 star hotel so if you are expecting a 5 star hotel you should have booked a 5 star hotel ( and paid a 5 star hotel price). This was a great deal for the price. Also remember, things are what you make out of them, so just relax and have fun, it seems to work for Mexicans. Also, the staff work for a very small amount of money and altho the hotel adds say all tips are included, please tip, it makes a difference in these peoples lives. Tip the activies staff too as they never get tips and really made our stay special. If you have any specific questions feel free to ask me.

The ocean was beautiful. All of the beach appears to be back unlike last time we were there. Always could get a lounge chair at pool or beach. Beach seemed to be more crowded. Activities were fun and staff was wonderful. Tried to get kids involved. Trapeze was a great touch. Shows were entertaining. Went into town $5 cab ride. Felt completely safe. There is a small mall right outside the hotel which we went to some nights. Did trip to Xel-ha. Bought tickets at hotel, which include the park, food, drink and towels. Took a cab so we could come back when we wanted but ended up staying alot longer than I thought. They give you a locker at the park also. Make sure you get a locker near where you will be doing most of your activities. Food was good at the park, had a great time there. Lots to see. Back to the hotel, the food was good. We really enjoyed the ala carte restaurants, the mediteranean and italian, very good food. Great presentation especially on the desserts. Ate alot at the buffets and snack bars. So many things to pick from you always find something. No complaints on having to wait. Sometimes at the pool snack bar they ran out of some things but have a little bit of patience. Great nachos and ice cream. Bartenders were great, never had to wait more than 2 minutes or so, usually less. The strawberry daquiris are always ready, there is not alcohol in them unless you ask, that way kids can drink them. These guys work hard to keep everyone happy.

Realized the next morning when we saw our friends that he didn't comply. Oh well, we weren't going to let that effect our vacation, just went with the flow. Food was amazing, managed to get a reservation to Mexican on the first night, we loved all the a la carte meals on every level, quality, presentation and service. Word of advice, be courteous. People really go out of their way once you show some appreciation for their hard work. The restaurants are run in a very professional and efficient manner, can't comment on the reservation system, we did alright because we booked when we were waiting for our room to be assigned upon arrival. Buffet was really good, as well as, the pool snack bar, an abundance of food, a lot of choices all day. Loved the Mexican salsa, varying intensities, fresh Nachos, Guacamole and delicious Pizzas from the Pizza oven. Really couldn't have asked for more. Also, was so impressed by the vast menu of drinks, served in plastic cups around the pool and much fancier presentation in the lobby bar, what did they not serve? A good array of premium brands were available for the most part. Coffees were delicious, lattes, cappuccinos, espressos, excellent! Shows were nice and unquestionably the Entertainment crew worked tirelessly, but missed any form of live entertainment other than shows. No live musicians like in Cuba, Dominican, not even any Mariachis on Folklore night. Not enough Mexican/Latin entertainment. Visited the Riu next door and they were dancing to a live Latin band in the afternoon. Disco catered more to the younger crowd ,but , that may also be due to March break. A German MC in Mexico? No offence but at least if he had a better grasp of Latin Entertainment. His Michael Jackson impersonation was amazing though. Freaked out when I realized it was him. Room was basic but our maid cleaned it to perfection every single day. Even changed our bed sheets. Our friends had the renovated section in block one, definitely better, fresher and more modern looking including new linens, flat screen and a beautiful shower stall. Would've been nice, but it didn't deter our vacation. Just would've been more convenient for us so the kids could've been closer. Beach is stunning , but not the calm shallow waters of Cuba, the Dominican and other island destinations. Must be careful with the undertow, not a place where you can just waddle. Plus, it's a high traffic hotel strip beach with people walking up and down, still beautiful though! Playa Del Carmen is a modern commercial centre tourist spot. Definitely does not feel remote and exotic. Still may go back, had a great time with our group, kids were happy. Loved the Mexican people.

I just noticed someone saying in a previous review that they were robbed at the resort... that is totally opposite to what I witnessed when we were there, so I have to wonder if it wasn't other travellers at that time that were the problem. We left our cameras, beach bags, towels, & clothes spread out over the chairs at the beach (and at the pool) many times throughout our week, and everything was EXACTLY like we left it when we returned - sometimes hours later! We were a group of 11, with 6 teenagers, 4 adults and 1 child, and after the initial day of getting used to things, I would say there wasn't any point that I was worried about any of the kids. There were lots of activities for the teenagers, although they tended to stick to the tennis, beach volleyball and water activities. The kids club was great, but my daughter at 10 kind of fell between the cracks of the \"kids\" activities and \"teen\" activities... although they did invite her numerous times to come and join them, and she did for a few activities and had a lot of fun. The beach itself was truly amazing with tons of beautiful white sand gorgeous turquoise water; the pools were also wonderful, as was the swim up bar! The nightly entertainment was also very good... the staff running the shows did an amazing job, especially when you find out how little time they have to practice! The food at both the buffet and the a la carte restaurants was absolutely wonderful. We didn't have a problem finding something that was delicious at any point during our stay, and the beach buffet was also great at providing a variety of quick things to pick up in between activities. The service... everyone was very helpful and accomodating, and at one point when our teens TV was \"buzzing\", they were at their room within 10 minutes and had replaced it. The cleaning staff also did an excellent job of keeping our room tidy on a daily basis... and the kids loved their surprise towel animals! My only caution to fellow travellers, especially my fellow pale Canadians, would be to make sure you re-apply your sunscreen often! We didn't realize that the salt water washes your sunscreen off quickly, so a few of our group got fairly bad sunburns... definitely not the resort's fault... but a good thing to remember! I would say that I think I loved most that this was a smaller resort and everything that you needed was a short walk away... you didn't need to worry about catching a bus or shuttle anywhere... you just walked! It was great for kids/teens and it gave us parents a chance to relax and unwind as well!

Our family and friends were so impressed with everything we are going to return next March for a longer vacation! Please let Marcos know we are very thankful he was our wedding planner and can't wait to see him in a year! Also thank you to the rest of the staff who made our trip so enjoyable!

From the moment we arrived tat the Wyndham Maya (a lovely hotel, about an hour from the airport and situated in gated Playa del Carmen on a stretch of white sandy beach) there were staff to greet us and offer drinks. Although we arrived before check in we got a room quickly and were settled and ready to start our vacation within an hour. As suggested here on trip advisor, we booked our a la cartes the second day and got reservations for all three but would reccommend booking as soon as you arrive to get better times than we got (we were feeding our kids at 930 at night and they were tired). The food was tasty, well-prepared and beautifully presented at all three restaurants. We never lined up for anything. The buffet had a very good selection of food and we certainly never went hungry. The kids LOVED it. The drinks were easy to get (no line-ups), and served by friendly smiling bartenders. This was the first hotel in the carribbean we have been to that when they said all non-motorized watersports were included they meant it - no extra cost and my husband and kids enjoyed boogie boards and kayaking everyday. The beach is gorgeous and you are not bothered by people selling things and the hotel feels very safe. There is a cute shopping plaza right across the street and the famous Playa del Carmen \"Fifth Avenue\" is a $5. cab ride or 25 minute walk down the beach. We tipped our housekeeping one or two american dollars everyday and our room was sparkling clean each day with all of our things neat and tidy and a cute towel animal on the girls' bed, and two fresh bottles of water on our counter. Three of the four of us slept well everyday. This hotel was clean, well-situated, serviced by friendly helpful staff and family friendly. We loved our trip.

The only thing I didn't like about my trip was the fact that you \"waste\" almost 2 days of it traveling! The resort's beach is fabulous now--very wide. Although as someone not used to swimming in the ocean, I think I actually preferred the sand whales from last year--they made for a nice, calm, \"inlet\" type of swimming experience. Our TA had called ahead, and I'd also emailed a request for a room in the 1000 block. We'd been in the king bed room 1204 last year and this year we got 1216, as we needed two doubles to make room for our daughter. Refrigerator was there, had only a couple of sodas in it, but we never even drank them--with the beach bar just steps away, why bother? Housekeeping is amazing--not a speck of sand on the floor after they cleaned...and they only use brooms, no vacuums. I actually felt a little slobby when we returned after the first day on the beach to find our papers/magazines neatly stacked, the various bottles of sunscreen, lotion and other stuff we'd left on the desk arranged neatly...and our shoes were standing up on their heels against the wall, offering more room to walk. We loved the food. Nothing better than having a bunch of choices at every meal. My picky, picky daughter had peanutbutter toast every morning and was totally happy. She also loved the beach pizza, burgers and fries. We ate at Portofino one night and had the most tender beef and chicken. We also ate at Miramar over the beach bar--lasagna was very good and so was my daughter's calzone--but neither had ricotta, which was a little odd. I think the one definate I can say about Mexican cooks--cheese is NOT their strong suit, but they do try hard. The girl LIVED for her 35 minutes (25 pesos) at one of four computers in a little room off the lobby bar. Gotta have Facebook, right? It was nice, actually, to stay slightly connected to what was going on in Vermont (although it was snowing quite a bit, it stopped before we got home). Loved the drinks too--mojitos, margaritas, rum punch, bahama mamas and a few more. Americans were in short supply, but there were tons of English-speaking Canadians (Hi Joelle and Jerry!) and we had a lot of great conversations. Would love to see Mexico go non-smoking in restaurants, etc, but I don't think that'll happen. Luckily, it's always breezy so the smoke was never too bad. Finally--I've never seen anyone work as hard as the people at this resort. From the table-setters to the bartenders and the groundspeople....they work so hard and I know its for so little.

He was so helpful and gave us so much information. We had a group of 33 in total, and everyone really enjoyed the resort. Sunwing is a bit of a sketchy airline, but that is nothing to do with the hotel.

Our neighbours were very loud and had crying kids, so that would be our only complaint. We arrived when they were doing the restoring of the beach, which concerned me a bit as we were getting married on tues Feb 2nd and were hearing rumours that the beach wouldnt be finished in time. This was no fault of the resorts. We met with Marco 2 days before the wedding and he was just wonderful. He went through everything with us, had back up plans if the beach wasnt ready and he just took the stress away. The day of our wedding was perfect. The set up was beautiful and everything was better than I ever could've imagined. We rented out the Miramare restaurant so we could have it private to us and our family and friends. Dinner was so delicious, and the servers did an amazing job keeping up with all the drinks. We had a DJ too who did a really great job. All in all, I would recommend this resort to anyone, especially anyone who is getting married. There were no complaints from anyone in our group. We thought the food was good and the staff was great! If anyone is thinking about planning a wedding here, do it, and you can contact me for more information. To all the people who cut this place down, I would say their expectations are obviously that of a 5 star, huge fancy resort.

We were nervous about booking a resort sight-unseen; but after reading many reviews here we decided to give it a shot. This was our first trip to an all-inclusive resort so we had nothing to base our expectations on except what we had read online. I have to say that we were pleasantly surprised. Our room was clean and comfortable. The beds were firm but we prefer a firm mattress and slept well all week. We had two double beds instead of a king which we would have preferred. We had a balcony with garden view which was fine for us. The balcony was just large enough for us both to sit, not much room for moving around but it served our purpose. Our room was on the third floor (no elevators) but again, not a deal-breaker. Our favorite area of the resort was the lobby area. The area was bustling with folks from early in the morning to late evening. We really enjoyed having coffee there in the morning after breakfast and it was a great place to meet up for cocktails later in the evening as well. We had no problems making dinner reservations. We did this as soon as we checked in, however, we were only guaranteed two reservations as we were only staying five nights. We were told we could obtain another reservation either onsite or at the sister resort (Azteca) if we checked early enough for availability but we never got around to it and opted to eat in Playa two nights. We had buffet for dinner on our first night and were not disappointed by the food. Typical buffet fare, plenty to choose from. We had buffet for breakfast each morning and by the end of our stay were growing weary of the same choices for breakfast, but seriously, how much variety can you add to a breakfast buffet? We ate at Portofino - the a la carte Mediterranean restaurant. Our first two courses were wonderful but our mistake was in ordering beef for our entrees. Beef was overcooked and my husband sent his first plate back because it was clearly cooked well done when he had requested medium rare. My husband is a chef and this meal was a definite downer as it was painfully obvious that the food in this restaurant was not cooked to order but rather, was par-cooked ahead of time and finished off upon ordering. A la carte means cooked to order and this was definitely not the case. We felt mislead. We also ate at Don Diegos - the a la carte Mexican restaurant. This was a better meal, but again, not cooked to order. We ate here for my husband's birthday and the staff made a big deal out of it, much to hubby's dismay (I was thrilled, or course). The beach area was clean with plenty of chairs. Lots of chair saving going on though, which was clearly prohibited. We were typically down to the beach before 9am each morning and already prime seats had been saved with towels and personal belongings. How early were these people getting up to do that? There were plenty of activities going on throughout the day and the staff was very eager to get people to participate. Although this was a family friendly resort, we rarely saw children and never felt like they were out of control or a nuisance. We had great service, though at times the bartenders were inconsistent in drink preparation. Most of the drinks were watered down but we quickly learned how to get them a bit stronger - either a tip or simply asking for extra shots on the side. Playacar was a great area to stay in - a $5 cab ride into Playa del Carmen. Very safe, very clean. The resort itself served our purposes - clean room, on the beach.

I will say it was not all good, but a great stay over all. - The hotel was close to the town of Playa Del Carmen (1 mile) which was very convenient for shopping and being close to good restaurants. a cab ride from downtown Playa is 5 dollars. -The Playacar complex made us feel very safe as there was security to get into the complex it's self as well as security at the hotel. - The Beach, they were doing some reconstruction at the time that we stayed so there was a guard at the entrance to the beach to keep people off a very small and specific part of the beach that was being worked on at the time. No inconvenience whats-so-ever and did not affect our beach time at all. The sand was very soft and clean, I was actually pleasantly surprised at the lack of garbage on the beach. there were also no sandbag \"whales\" that I have read so much about in other reviews. -The pools. We didn't really hang out at the activity pool as the chairs were always \"reserved\" with the blue towels that many previous reviews ranted about.There was a sign near the towel rental area that stated it was against hotel policy to reserve the chairs in this manner, however the resort itself does nothing to enforce this; I think it would make a huge difference if the management was actually involved in enforcing this so called policy.It was noisy and there were many kids, and very few parents. The \"relaxation\" pool near the front of the resort is fabulous however, and seemed to always have open chairs (not near the towel rental place so to reserve the chair you actually had to be sitting in it). They also don't allow any kids at the relaxation pool so It was delightfully quiet. there was plenty of chairs in the sun, and It has a great bar there, but was not close to food, where as the other pool was right next to the snack bar.Also it was not conveniently located near a restroom, I had to use the restroom next to the gym. Not so bad actually, unless you're drinking a lot. - the Bars, all of the bars make great drinks, and the bartenders are very friendly. However they are severely over worked, and I saw an EXTREME lack of tipping. I didn't tip every drink, but being in a tipping job myself, I always made sure they were compensated, many of the bartenders that I saw at 11pm were there making coffee at 7am. TIP WELL PLEASE. My favorite drinks were, The cappuccino, Mayan coffee made with Mayan honey liqueur that tastes like anise, The banana mama(amazing and refreshing), and of course margaritas, and pina coladas were great too. The lobby bar was my favorite place to hangout, there was ample seating, and a covered area if you wanted to get out of the sun. -The restaurants, The buffet was fine, small and if you go during peak hours it can get very crowded. I mostly ate bacon and eggs in the morning with fresh fruit, and coffee. I didn't try the omelette bar as it was always too busy, and two eggs over easy was just as good in my opinion. the fruit is amazing, and there were a lot of options for bread. the juices were good, although in the morning I only ever had the grapefruit, but there was orange and apple, and a few others. At lunch the options changed, there was also beer and pop. On sunny days the buffet is quieter because most people eat at the snack bar near the beach. If you eat dinner at the buffet they serve wine(the white was actually pretty good). And if you tip your server they will remember you the next night and will literally be at your beck and call. the Ala Carte restaurants were okay. We ate at the Mexican one for our anniversary they don't have a huge menu, and the food is just okay, but the service is fabulous.we also ate at the Italian restaurant that over looks the beach, kind of the same story, but the plus side is that you can order drinks from the bar at this restaurant. - the rooms, the beds are HORRIBLE!!!!!!. The hardest thing I have ever slept on, and I use to sleep in sleeping bags when camping. every morning I would wake up with one limb or another numb and tingling from the lack of circulation. I don't know what they could do to improve this except maybe adding a box spring instead of just a mattress on a concrete platform. I didn't experience the \"thin walls\" everyone talks about, but if you're a light sleeper I would suggest these things called ear plugs. The maids were great and left us little animals. I left a little tip and asked for extra water. I got the same thing we got our first day. I guess they can't give you more water. (2 small bottles), but there was always juice and water available at the pool bar, and our room 1231 was close to the pool bar so that was fine. the shower was one of those hand wand things with no real pressure. Not like the states, but it did the job. The toilet took two flushes(you know what I mean). But over all, I had everything I needed, and it got the job done, if I wanted a five star room I would stay at a five star resort. -We did two excursions, Chichen Itza which we got on special for 60 dollars american each. It was originally 100. It was a pretty good deal, very cultural, I would suggest bringing your own snacks because the breakfast they provide is not enough to fuel you for the 2+ hour tour of Chichen Itza, it's about 2 1/2 hour bus ride, and you stop at a cute Mayan artisan store where you can buy souvenirs, these people are very kind and we bought a few beautiful glasses there as the funds go to help the village and the Mayan people which kinda made me feel good. Chichen Itza is amazing and our guide \"Beto\" was very knowledgeable we learned a lot about this lost civilization. There are a lot of vendors, and they bombard you with \"buy lady\", and \" I give you good price\", we didn't buy anything from the vendors, but we did get a Mayan calender with our anniversary date in Mayan long count for about 20 bucks, very cool. Our second excursion was a snorkeling trip off of Cozumel. Not really worth the 35 bucks, very few fish. It could have been the day we went but It was pretty disappointing, and I kept getting stung by jelly fish, and the water was so cold, my arms were numb. We walked around Cozumel I wish we had more time to look around, it looks like a fun place to explore. We could have rented a scooter for 25 bucks for the day, honestly, we should have done that instead. Tips: -Don't pay for a transfer!!!!! The transfer from the airport I heard from someone took 4 hours, and cost 22 dollars per person each way. Plus you have to be at the front desk 4 hours before you have to BE at the airport. My suggestion is to take the \"ADO\" bus from the airport to downtown playa. The ADO bus has a booth at the end of the terminal right before the exit. The bus cost us 116 pesos, or roughly 9 dollars a person. It took us 55 mins to get to playa from the airport, and hopped a cab at the bus station for five bucks.So It cost us 24 dollars with tip to get to the hotel, and the same price to get back to the airport. It was an air conditoned bus with a a bathroom and very comfortable seats. The bus back to the airport said it would take two hours (multiple stops) however, our bus was almost completely full, and we only made two very short stops, so we got to the airport in about 1hour and 5 min. money- I would suggest exchanging to pesos, because the exchange rate is better. However for tips I would suggest having ample singles. Over all it was a great stay, and we had no major issues. we didn't get sick at all, and the resort is good for it's value. except for the beds!!", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cbest time of my life!\u201d", "Author": "ryankesler", "ReviewID": "UR55680878", "Content": "Either than the beach being closed it was fantastic.

The rooms were adequate but not enough closet or drawer space, and the floors are very slippery after a shower and same goes for the pathways and pool decks after a rain.

I know everyones experience is different, but i did not meet one person during my stay that did not love the hotel. Location- the hotel is located in a private community (playacar) which houses a golf course apparently. ITS VERY SAFE! i cannot stress this enough. you can rent a bike/take a walk at night and you never feel unsafe. the playacar community is beautiful and filled w/other resorts and private vacation rental houses. you are right next to playa del carmen (a short car ride/20 minute walk or so). and across the street from the hotel is a little area with a starbucks and souvenirs (some which are overpriced but certain vendors were not willing to haggle). I would suggest going into town and souvenir shopping there. there is a huge souvenir store right on the corner of the main avenue that houses the cheapest souvenirs with a huge variety of items. there is also cheap internet (8 pesos for 30 minutes and 4 pesos for every page printed) and an amazing empanada place right across the street (only 7 pesos for one!). Grounds- the hotel grounds were pretty and very well kept. it wasnt that difficult getting around and there are plenty of staff walking around and can direct you if you get lost. the hotel is right in front of a gorgeous beach. there are plenty of chairs (i never experienced not being able to reserve a beach chair) and the beach is beautiful. only one day were we not able to swim in the water due to strong currents. i would not recommend snorkeling as you cant really see anything. for snorkeling you should try one of the tours or the 2 ecological parks (xel-ha/xteca which are amazing and worth every penny. the xteca show is not to be missed). also there was no kayaking/water surfing due to construction/waves. so even though they list those activites they are not always available. Rooms- were very modern and spacious. we had a private balcony, central air and flat screen tv. the bathrooms were very nice and the staff did a great job cleaning every day. We always had new water bottles and fresh towels. my only complaint was that the room was a little musty. so if you had wet clothing there was no way it was drying in the room, and all the papers we had were a little moist by the end of our stay. Food- there was food available at all hours of the day. the breakfast buffet is delicious (definitely try the donuts), the lunch buffet and dinner buffet was good too. they had a huge variety of food that satisfied every palate. they also had a snack buffet right by the beach. we tried the italian and mexica restaurants which were both very good (dont get the pizza at the italian restaurant as it is same pizza that they serve at the snack buffet). we also tried the buffet and mexican restaurant at axteca. the mexican restaurant was excellent, better then the one at maya. but the buffet is the same thing you would get at maya. my only word of advice is try to make all the reservations when you get there, as the restaurants fill up quickly and you might not be able to get them day of. Staff- the staff here is AMAZING. the entertainment staff are extremely friendly and go out of there way to make you feel comfortable. the bar staff make some mean drinks and you never have more then a 5 minute wait to get a drink. the cleaning staff and service staff are quick and always willing to help you get what you need. The entertainment staff have various classes/activities/tournaments that they organize and it is a good way to spend some of the day (after you have burned to a crisp at the beach :). they also put on a show every night at 9:30. the shows are well choreographed and you can tell the staff puts a lot of effort and has a lot of pride in performing. (they do not sing though, they just lip sync to the american songs). but there dancing is great. i would highly recommend catching the shows, they are highly entertaining. General: the exchange rate at the hotel is 12.3. there is an HSBC bank in town BUT THEY DO NOT EXCHANGE MONEY. the best exchange rate we saw was at the supermaket. if you buy one thing in dollars (a coke costs 7 pesos) they will give you pesos back (12.78 pesos per dollar). so buy something cheap and give them a $20. There are misquitos so dont keep your windows open at night and bring spray/cream. i got bitten 5 times at one of the outdoor restaurants. Also you should bring a light jacket as the wind picks up at night (especially near the stage/beach area). if you take a walk outside of the resort at night you probably wont need it but its windy near the bar/stage. It does rain but its on and off. so expect half the day to rain and half the day to be sunny. so dont freak out if you check the weather and its expected to rain for the rest of the week. I would recommend this hotel over the axteca. its bigger, the staff are amazing and overall i though it was a better value then axteca. Car rental- we rented a car and it was worth it. the hotel is 10 minutes from xteca park and 30 minutes from tulum/cancun/xel-ha. there is one major highway 307 and there are many signs so you dont have to worry about getting lost. parking can be an issue so we only went into playa del carmen at night. the mexican drivers can be aggressive so just drive defensively and you should be fine. if you plan on just staying at the resort i wouldnt rent a car, but if you want to take day trips i would get a car. its cheaper and easier then hailing taxis every time you want to go somewhere. just one word of caution: while waiting for our car at the airport we overheard someone complain about getting pulled over by the mexican police. they took his license and demanded $150 to get it back. i read about this before i left so i was aware of it but luckily it didnt happen to us. follow the speed limits (be careful they change frequently on the highway) and if you do get pulled over only speak english and try to be ignorant and apologetic (\"officer i dont know where im going can you help us get to playa del carmen?\"). dont yell or get angry. if they ask for a bribe make sure to take down there name and badge number, and tell them you would rather go to the station to pay the fine. MAKE SURE YOU GET YOUR LICENSE BACK! often times they will just let you go, since mexico is cracking down on bribery and they dont want to run the risk of losing there jobs. (and the fine should be cheaper then the bribe). but for the most part the police are friendly and playa del carmen has a specific police force for tourists. Overall this hotel is in a great location, has AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING staff and is worth every penny.

Kind of funny looking by Minnesota standards but certainly not like a rat! Beach was an interesting experience since during our week it was closed for three days for some kind of repair. Not the hotels fault I'm sure since the repairs ran for quite some distance up and down the beach so many resorts were affected. From the day we arrived til the day we left 7 days later they had widened the beach about 100 feet! It was fabulous by the time we left and the surf was great for playing. Staff - amazing.

The staff were faultless in all aspects. The rooms were cleaned exceptionally & the little towel animals left in the bathroom were a source of much enjoyment for our 3 year old. The bar staff were always quick, attentive & friendly, with or without tips.

Waiting staff in restaurants were so attentive, I don't think we ever reached the bottom of a glass of wine during dinner & our plates were cleaned away almost instantly. I don't think we came across one member of staff who didn't greet us with a smile. The rooms were basic but very functional, plenty of room for the four of us & altho the walls were admittedly thin we never had any problems sleeping. The air conditioning was louder than most i've come across before but was by no means as bad as some people have made out. The selection of food & drinks is fantastic & we found we never tired of anything. Breakfast was fab with so much choice, I especially recommend the freshly made omlettes, delicious!! The a la carte restaurants were brilliant, our fave was portofino the medaterranean, great food and first class service. We never had any problems getting reservations and ate at 8 during our 14 night stay. The location is great, a short walk into Playa del Carmen which is definately worth the trip, we had a handful of people try to sell us stuff but it wasn't intrusive at all. The resort is located on the beach which is just beautiful. We found it was perfect having the pool, bar, beach & snack bar all within such close proximity, a drink was never far away & the children enjoyed being able to switch between the beach and pool whenever they felt like it. We only had troulbe getting a lounger on one occasion but admittedly did usually reserve some before breakfast. This is not the hotels policy but was what everyone seemed to do & altho I don't think its right this has always been the way no matter where i've stayed in the world so is not out of the ordinary. The resort is perfectly sized, small enough to easily navigate around but it didn't at all feel cramped. The grounds are well maintained & the grounds maintenance staff were always seen around the place working hard, again they always said hi with a smile. There was work going on with the beach during our stay but this was not the hotels fault but scheduled work by the local goverment. As far as I could see the hotel did everything they could to make this have minimum impact on peoples holidays. It is just unfortunate timing if you were here during this time. The snack bar / grill deserves a special mention as the food here was delicious & plentiful. The freshly made pizza's were excellent as was the salsa & guacamole & there was a large selection of salads and fruits etc. As for the comments about the other guests at the hotel we never experienced any rudeness or problems with anyone else.

I will start by getting the BAD part of the trip over first and then focus on the GOOD part: BAD PART: 100% Sunwing Airline...By far the worst airline that I have ever flown on. I read past reviews and they all suggested that Sunwing was horrible. I thought maybe theyn were exaggerating, NO WAY, THEY NAILED IT! First thing, expect a delay of about 2 hours to each flight. FLIGHT THERE: We were supposed to fly out of Vancouver on a red eye at 11:30 pm but did not leave until 0230 am. They're excuse: they wer short staffed!! The seats are all horrible, NO leg nor arm room!! Screaming children (I love kids, I have my own but left them at home) but when a flight is vey uncomfortable, kids are by far the first to complain and they did!! FLIGHT HOME: Once again, another delay of an 90 minutes (no excuse this time). Screaming kids. You can NOT sleep on Suwing!!...ONE IMPORTANT THING: You are only allowed approx 50lbs per passenger (incl all luggage and carry on), that is not a lot for a 7 day vacation. Sunwing allowed us to fly from Vancouver, but on the way back the Mexican Sunwing raped us for $100 US extra claiming we were over 20lbs!! AVOID SUNWING, pay the extra and fly Westjet!!!!!!!! GOOD PART: The entire stay at the Viva Wyndham Maya!!!!! We arrived in at 10:30 am (Maya time) and they promptly secured our bags and we got changed. I was drinking a Margaretta in the Ocean 15 minutes later (my second wind after the brutal flight down)! Even though checkin time was 3:00 pm, they had a room available to us by noon. We stayed in the BEST room (2319!!!). King size bed! 3 minute walking distance to the 24 hours snack bar,pool bar and beach! Patio overlooked 3 main things: 1. Pool 2. Beach/ocean and 3. We had full view of the stage (we didn't even have to leave our paio to watch the shows!!). The air conditioning was great for two reasons: 1. It was the cooolest I have felt and 2. drained out any excess noise! The beach was amazing!!! I spent all of my time in the ocean opposed to the pools! They have all watercraft available at no extra charge: kayak, sailboat, catamaran,boogie boards and snorkel equipment! Plenty of comfortable beach loungers! The waves were amazing, some were 5 feet high, great boogeyboarding!! Food was great!! I don't know what other people were wining about on trip advisor, but I enjoyed our meals, lots and lots to choose from. Fresh expresso, cappachinos etc. at all of the bars. We booked 3 reservations at the al la carte restaraunts (all great)! The bars are great! The pool bar is 24 hours!! I got very drunk on the first night, so I paced myself the rest of the trip as not to ruin the trip by being hungover. Staff are great! They never bothered us to participate in the extra sports as I had read before. They work 16 hour shifts and always have a smile on their face! MINOR NEGATIVE THINGS: -our toilet got backed up a few times, as well as my sister-in-law's suite, bt once we called the front desk, they would attend within 15 minutes -deserts were little bland -Europeans insist on having their children either roam around the beach in the nude or the pre-teen girls are topless. Utterly wrong and both my wife and I were disgusted by this! We know it is sensitive but we wished the resort staff could have enforced something on this Other than that the resort was great! We would go back again! Sites to check out: 1. Xel-Ha: Natural aqauarium, best snorkeling. $95 us per person. Incl: 45 min shuttle there, leaves at 8:00 am, full day there (0900 to 500), locker, towels, snorkel gear, all inclsuive buffet (great food) and drinks!! Great day!! 2. Coco Bongo's Nite Club, Playa del Carmen: $55 US per person (important: book this trought the VIP table at the resort NOT te excursion tables such as Sunwing) you get a t-shirt, transportation there, escort by one of the Viva Wyndham staff, cover charge, bypass he crazy 4 hour lineup, private table and personal waiter, OPEN BAR! You leave the resort at 11:00 pm and you stay as long as you want (CLub closes at 0630am!!)....The shows are amazing!!!! Never seen anything like it before!! Live non-stop shows, IMAX screen,multi floors, 3500 people capacity and it was full!!! We left after the shows atabout 0330 am (dancing then starts until 0630). Important: you have to get your own way back to the resort. Only $5 cab ride, lots and lots of cabs. 3. Shopping trip into Playa del carmen. Only $5 US cab ride. Lots of deals, lots of shops. Could easily spend a couple days looking around! They even have Starbucks, Burger king etc...LOL..Ice cold coronas only $1 us!!

We are from Alberta, and one of the staff working there is actually from a small town in Alberta so that was neat too. The beach was awesome - yes there are sandbags in the water and they may not look the most attractive, however, there would be no beach without them. The food was good. There were enough a la cartes there that you never got bored, and if you do, then it's just a half hour walk to Playa Del Carmen with the closest restaurant being McDonalds :). The booze never stops. I love swim up bars and was glad they had one. I found that if you tip a dollar every two or three drinks, it goes a looooong way and they will definitely do their best to get to you before others. The disco is what you make of it - we met some great people while we were there, so it was always a blast. However, the hotel does a good job to take you into some of the clubs in town. We had an arrangement set up to go to Coco Bongs in PDC however the swine flu outbreak prevented that from happening as the club closed that night. We did however, make it into Blue Parrot which was a blast and I would highly recommed - a small cover fee at the door gets you unlimited drinks and a dance floor on the beach.

We were not disappointed. Food was very good, little to no line-ups, and the beach was marvelous. We had no troubles getting into the restaurants, including on New Year's Eve. Guest Services opened at 8:00am and I was in line about 15 minutes before, and never had a problem booking a restaurant. The cafeteria-style restaurant that you don't have to book in advance could, I suppose, get a little repetitive after a while, but we only ate there three evenings of the seven we were there. Our teenagers enjoyed the various activities, including archery, the rock-climbing wall, and of course the trapeze. Our teenagers did a lot of activities without us around, and they were treated well by the eager and friendly staff. The evening shows were fun, and the beach was absolutely great. Service was perfectly adequate. Our balcony's lock broke, and a quick call to the reception desk had repair staff there quickly. We also took advantage of the free water sports equipment, again never having a problem getting boogie boards or sea kayaks. We also took the free bikes into Playa del Carmen for shopping. The three-hour time limit of borrowing bicycles seemed a little too strict, especially given the fact that there were always over 100 bikes there, but when we did return them late once, no one seemed bothered. Prices at the spa were reasonable and the staff were pleasant. There are those who have commented on this site that they had a bad time here. We kept our eyes open for these problems, but honestly, our experience was much better than our expectations. We would certainly come back. We were in the older part of the resort, and it was very clean (as was the whole resort). We had no bar fridge in the room, but given the always available open bars, and the lack of interest in sitting in the room, this was not a concern.

The cleaning staff were always friendly and smiling, the bartenders were alot of fun, made fantastic drinks and always kept people smiling. The activities/entertainment staff were great!!

The nightly shows were entertaining and the daily activities were made fun just by the staff's positive and upbeat energy. The activites staff worked hard at trying to remember many of the guests by name and able to carry on multiple conversations about specific things with all the guests, it gave a very homey comfortable feel to the resort. The front desk staff and guest services were not friendly, guest services seemed put off when we stopped by to ask questions. We were very surprised by this as everyone else working at the resort was great. The buffet had lots of different options, I have a food allergy and was still able to find many different things to eat each day. The wait staff was also fantastic. I can't say enough how impressed we were with Wyndham's staff. We ate at the Mexican a la carte and although there weren't many options on the menu, the food we did order was delicious and again the wait staff was a lot of fun and extremely friendly. I don't have a single bad thing to say about this resort other than the front desk staff.

My wife and I along with our two teenage kids (16 & 13) stayed for 2 weeks and enjoyed every minute.

I don\u2019t recall her telling us that she was bored even once. (You will know what I mean if you have a 13 year daughter.) My son kept busy with the animation staff's activities. We were a little disappointed to see most of the last years animation team had moved on, but the new staff were just as great as the previous bunch. We did notice that the resort was a bit under staffed and a little stingy on the food. We arrived a week before the newly renovated block one opened. So when the block one opened, the resort doubled in people over night. It was overwhelming for the staff and service did fall behind. Otherwise, all was good. It was nice to be welcomed back by the resort. Many of the staff recognized us and were glad to see our return. Especially the bar tenders. I am not sure if that's a good or a bad thing. We do enjoy this resort for a many reasons. The main reasons were the location, the beaches, and the small cozy resort setting. The most important of all is the animation team. The group of guys and girls that make up the animation team make the stay at the Maya so enjoyable. It was real hard to leave; we became such good friends with all of them.

We had a great trip and would consider returning to this hotel, if/when we return to this area of Mexico. For this trip we got a pretty good deal and it was excellent value. Highlights: 1 - Beautiful white sandy beach with waves just strong enough for the kids to have lots of fun, but not too strong to make it unsafe for them. My 6 year old was happy to spend hours jumping in the waves every day. My husband tried to snorkel in front of the resort, but the sand was too stirred up to see much. You can walk the beach about 10 minutes in either direction (there are 4-5 resorts on either side) 2 - Staff were very friendly and fun. Especially the girls at the kids club - my kids weren't keen to go to the kids club - they were a little shy (which was fine), but they were often encouraged by the staff to join in on their activities when we saw them about (ie. games, face painting, sand castles), and they enjoyed themselves when they did join in. The other activities staff made everything fun (dance lessons, volleyball, bocce, etc). 3 - Food was very good - pizza & guacamole with nachos was our lunch at the snack bar most days - I miss it already - but they also always had burgers, soup, pasta & rice, fruit, etc. The buffets had lots of selection, and they changed up the themes and specialty items each day. We ate at 2 a la cartes (Mexican & Mediterranean) - both were fabulous! Excellent meals and service there. You do need to reserve early though - I made our reservations on the first morning. A la cartes have a decent wine list (extra charge) - or you can get the house wine included, which we thought was quite good (both red & white). 4 - Evening shows were fun - we didn't see all of them (they started at 9:30, following the mini-disco for kids at 9 - which was late for our kids) but we enjoyed the ones we did see - don't miss the circus show! 5 - Large varied drink menu & bartenders were generous - my faves were banana mamas, husband's faves were mojitos. Cappucino/espresso are available at both the pool bar & lobby bar all day. There's also a smaller bar next to the adults-only pool. Bars also had self-serve juice & pop, which was great for the kids to get their own. We brought our own insulated travel mugs but didn't use them - the bars use large plastic (re-usable) cups - not tiny little disposable cups - and it wasn't so hot to melt our ice before we could finish the drink. 6 - Our room was very clean, beds were comfortable enough, we had a mini-fridge and flat screen tv, safe was free, big closet, a spacious bathroom and deep tub. Lots of hot water and pressure in the shower. Shampoo & body wash were included - shampoo must have had some conditioner in it, because my daughter's long hair never had tangles after blowing in the wind all day. 7 - They have a trapeze near the main activities area and you can swing on it as much as you want, during the hours they are open (kids ages 4+ between 11am & 1pm; adults between 3&5pm). 8 - Location of the resort is great - could walk to 5th Ave in Playa del Carmen in approx 30 mins, or a quick cab ride. Very minor \"Complaints\": 1 - Buffet felt crowded at peak times. The specialty grill in the middle (for omelets at breakfast, and made-to-order pasta, etc. at dinner) often had a long line. 2 - On days when we slept in, we couldn't find chairs on the beach, even though there were lots (but we were always able to find a few seats by the pool close to the beach). 3 - The pool was quite cold, but the weather wasn't that great either, I would assume that in hotter, sunnier weather the pool would heat up more. 4 - No wifi on the resort - but the internet package (available at gift shop in the lobby) is not expensive - I think 25 pesos/30 minutes (there are 4 computers available). And there's a Starbucks in the plaza across the street from the entrance - so you can use their wifi, if you buy a coffee. This resort is not luxury, but it suited us perfectly - easily 3-4 stars.

The pros The staff is amazing. The grounds are nice and spacious. The animation team is awesome. Santa arrived on the beach and that was a lot of fun for the kids. The Cons I have been to lots of all inclusive resorts. The food is not good. Somtimes you are able to find a thing or two to eat that is acceptable but most of the time it is awful. The hotel was very full and as a result as soon as the food was placed out it was like a feeding frenzie and all the food was gone in seconds. Lines were long for the grill and pasta. The omletes in the morning was horrible the filling was never cooked only by the young cook, the older gentlemen makes an excellent omlete. The drinks was horrible except for the tamarind margarita. Never call the resort dr. he charged us 130 us for each child that was sick and did nothing. Instead go straight to the Rivieria Maya Hospiten. My daughter was seen within 10 minutes of arriving by a dr and a pediatrician on call saw her within 15 minutes after the dr. There is obviously a cost. If you are looking for a pharmacy that carry specialized medication I suggest going to Farmacia Union they have everything more than walmart. It don't look like much when you pull up but they do have everything. The taxi drivers are your friends they know everything. To go site seeing to tulum.

Although the kitchen did have trouble keeping up with demand when the hotel was at capacity during the last week of our stay, the quality and selection of the food was very good. The service was excellent, the dining staff remembered our drink orders only after a few days and they were always smiling and very welcoming despite being extremely busy on some days. The a la carte restaurants were the best we've experienced at an all inclusive. The food and service were particularly good at the Portifino restaurant. You are able to book at the Wyndham Azteca resort down the beach as well. We ate at the Bamboo restaurant there but food and service didn't quite meet what we had experienced at Portifino. The bar service was very good. The bartenders were excellent about remembering our drink orders after only a few visits to the bar. We rarely had to wait to be served. The lounge tables were kept very clean. However, dishes and glasses being left on the grass and walkways by other guests is another issue. Rooms: We had requested a king size bed when we checked in but none were available. However, on our 3rd night they were able to find us a fantastic room with an ocean view which was absolutely amazing. The bed was very comfortable. The rooms were clean and maid-service was great. Our maid was always smiling and greeted us every time we saw her in the hallway. I requested some additional bottles of water to be placed in my room and it was done everyday for the remainder of my stay. You do get a bit of noise from the hallway from other guests but we didn't have any issues. The rooms could use a bit of a facelift but I was very happy with their condition and was not expecting the penthouse at the Ritz Carlton. Staff and Entertainment: Two areas of service that really made our trip amazing were the guest services team and the animation team. The guest services team was so accommodating and friendly. All requests were handled very efficiently. The animation team was the best we've seen at any of the all inclusive resorts we've been to. They were always making us laugh and feel welcome. I have to mention Madeline, Nicolas and Lucia on the animation team because they were really the ones that stood out for us and were the team members that made our trip memorable. The only feedback I would give the hotel is that there seems to be a lot of pressure to get guests to participate in the beach activities. When you're on vacation and all you want to do is lay on the beach and relax, being asked to play Bocce 7 times can get a little annoying. The evening shows were very good for an all inclusive. The choreography by Marcos was amazing. The \"Circus\", \"Moulin Rouge\" and \"Madonna\" shows were by far the best. The costumes were incredible as well. General Comments: The resorts grounds are quite beautiful and kept very well maintained. The beach was one of the best on the strip. It could have been cleaned more frequently but I think this issue was due more to the guests treating the beach as their own personal garbage can which was disappointing to see. If you want to go see some of the Mayan ruins at Coba and Tulum and you feel comfortable venturing off on your own, I would skip the tours offered at the hotel and rent a car. Book through a website to get the best rates. It is a lot cheaper and you don't have to follow a tour guide and 20 other people around for the entire day. Remember to bring extra money to tip your servers, bartenders and chambermaids daily at the resort. We were treated like royalty the entire visit and I'm sure this had something to do with it. Overall we were very happy with our experience and would recommend this hotel to anyone who is thinking about booking an all inclusive in the Mayan Rivera.", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cNever again - no Canadian should ever pay these people a dime!\u201d", "Author": "CanadianBlonde", "ReviewID": "UR51708243", "Content": "Unless you intend to be so drunk you don't notice the scunge around you in your room, the lousy food, the delapitated furniture, the chipped & leaking glasses, the scarce and tattered room towels - don't stay here!

We had a large, well-maintained ocean view room that was just spectacular. The beach is perfect - we never had a problem getting a beach chair, and one of our favorite things to go was to get a cup of coffee from the pool bar and a chocolcate-filled croissant. Delicious! The shows were fun to watch, and we visited three of the restuarants - Il Don Diego - which was FABULOUS, Miramar - above the pool bar, which was also delicious, and the Italian restaurant at the Wyndham Azteca, just down the road. All were very good, with excellent service. The buffet was so-so, but there's a lot of variety. Easy and quick when you're on the go. I highly recommend renting bikes and taking the short ride into Playa del Carmen for some shopping and the ferry to Cozumel. My only other tip would be to make your dinner reservations early in the morning... and at least one or two of the restaurants are usually closed which was a little disappointing. Avoid the timeshare people - the 'VIP desk' at all costs. They took up about 3 hours of our prime beach time and would not take no for an answer....

The last time we stayed we were in the area near the adult pool, this time we asked for a room as close to the beach as we could get and got one about a 3 min walk from door to sand and it was great!! The staff there is wonderful and very willing to help you whenever they get the opportunity. I have nothing bad to say about this resort, we have decided that we will be going every year at the same time 1 Dec-8 Dec. We met other couples that said the same thing. I talked to people that came over from the Azteca everyday and evening because they said this one was more happening. I made several reservations for the ala carte restaraunts at both the miya and the azteca. They were all nice and the buffet was excellent, even the snackbar near the pool was nice to eat at. If you go there and get involved in the activities which they have going all day long you will enjoy your stay. If you just want to complain about it not being a 5 star then i suggest you go and pay for a 5 star,( it may not be rated a 5 star but it should be) and i promise you that you wont have a better time than you would have there. You can stay somewhere that costs you three times the price and still find something to complain about if thats all you're about. If you go there expecting to have a good time and lots of fun then you will find exactly that. Another thing i liked about it was that they had top shelf liquors, but you have to ask for topshelf, if you dont you will get the cheap stuff. Our room was real nice and clean, i dont care how old the place is, it was nice and clean all the time. I also recommend that you take a day and catch the ferry to cozumel 2 people 48.00 roundtrip and snorkel. We had our own snorkeling geer and it was nice. Rent a scooter for 25.00 and get out of the tourist area, its a blast. DONT PAY THOSE SNORKEL BOATS!!!

It was my first experience traveling but my bf is quite well-traveled and has stayed at a variety of resorts and non-resort type places all over the Caribbean. Since it was my first time, I can only critique so much but here are some honest pro's & con's that I think might be helpful so you can know what to expect. CON's: Beds are hard. Really hard. We had a very difficult time sleeping as a result. Not much you can do about it though so you just have to tough it out. Check-in lobby is tiny. We came in on a busload so it was really crowded. Buffet is pretty good but not a very big selection and same food almost everyday. If you drink tea, bring your own tea bags! Pool grill has pretty good food but good luck getting any. As soon as something good is ready people swarm the grill and pile up their plates as much as they can. By the time you get to the food, there isn't much left. Do yourself a favour and go up to the buffet instead! A lot of seagulls. Some people leave food on their plates on the table and the seagulls come in and land on the tables and eat off the plates. Some people bring their plates to the beach so watch out for falling \"you know what\"! Sometimes it's funny but most of the time it's annoying. Beach is OK but pretty rough and full of sand bags to prevent erosion. It's a little unpleasing to the eye and the water can get pretty rough some days, so much so that you almost can't swim. A lot of vendors tend to pester you here a lot (I've since been to Dom. Republic and found the locals less annoying there). And watch out for the timeshares guys around the hotel lobby, sitting area. There's also a little market across the street in front of the hotel. Lots of timeshare people lurking around there - be warned! We got stuck with one guy for like half an hour! But there's a bank machine there I think & phones where you can use phone cards to call home. Don't get disheartened though - I did the con's 1st to get them over with so if you are going here there is good news to help you enjoy your stay... PRO's: The hotel staff are pretty good - very friendly especially if you tip which we always do. The rooms were always immaculate and freshly stocked with towels and soaps etc... no mini-bar for us though (not part of our package). A-la cartes are pretty good - my spouse had the most tender, mouthwatering steak at the Italian restaurant (and he is unbelievably fussy about beef). It was so tender he didn't use a knife. I enjoyed the Mexican themed restaurant as well. Entertainment is pretty good - we only watched one show though. Never had trouble finding chairs on the beach anytime of day. Beach is cleaned daily. Staff works really hard here to entertain & they do a great job! Pool looks nice but we never used it! Playa del Carmen, 5th Avenue: You can walk to Playa del Carmen by the beach but it's a good half hour and you can't walk down the beach the whole way. There are places where you can go up on the streets and gradually work your way there along the beach or you can follow the main street in front of the hotel called Paseo Xaman-Ha. Along this street there is a bird sanctuary which we found very interesting and highly recommend as a quick excursion but it is a little smelly. I think it was 10 or 20 US$ for that. There is also a little park on the street on the way to 5th Avenue that has some monuments and historical items that we found a bit interesting. Makes the trip down to 5th a little more exciting. If you don't like to walk - take a cab, it's not that expensive! And do make a trip to the 5th Avenue - it is well worth all the pestering by the locals. Lots of good buys and things to do and lots of places to eat, drink etc... We went to one restaurant for lunch several times called Las Mananitas on 5th between Calles 4 & 6 - awesome pina coladas, cold Corona & amazing food! Highly recommended! We also did the excusion to Xel-Ha Aquatic Park. We didn't go with a tour group to save $$. On one of the side streets in Playa there are the local buses and it's like $3 to go to Xel-Ha, a good 45 minute drive (not for the faint of heart!) and $3 to come back. There are buses that stop on the highway and you hop in (again, if you're nervous - go with the organized tour groups) and it is a pretty good walk in from the highway so be warned. The admission to the park was $75 US each for the day and there is lots of food and drink included in that and I suggest you get there early so you can enjoy the whole day there because there is so much to see and do! It's a lot of fun! Definitely look that one up! For my first time on a trip down south, I had a blast. My bf was a little disappointed but happy for me that I had a good experience overall. It's not a fancy hotel and isn't very big but there is so much to see & do in the area that this is an OK rest stop while you're on the go. Definitely not for people expecting a luxurious, posh resort type getaway.... far from it!", "Date": "December 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Resort\u201d", "Author": "lexx20048", "ReviewID": "UR50999175", "Content": "Girlfriend and I just returned from this awesome resort. I cannot tell you how much we loved this resort. We walked over to the sister resort, the Aztec, and the difference was clear. Aztec is very quite while the Maya was very lively. The Maya is also a much better looking resort. The buffet area of the Maya is upstairs and thus is very private. The Aztec's buffet is downstairs in the open, so not private. Maya's buffet area looks like a restaurant, unlike the Aztec's buffet area. We read reviews on-line of people recommending to try the Aztec's buffet. When we went over there, we grabbed a plate and were quickly told that we could not eat there. So be warned. Apparently, you can eat at the Aztec's A La Carte's but not at their buffet....go figure. You'll need reservations to eat at any of the A La Carte's (Maya or Aztec). We stayed in the 2000 building. The 1000 building was closed due to renovations. Our room was clean and had everything we needed. We had a King sized bed and found it very comfortable. We were only every in our room to shower, change and sleep so were weren't very picky to begin with. Iron and blow dryer are included if you need them. There was also an in room safe which is free to use. There is a channel on the T.V. dedicated to the Maya Resort which tells you the hours the restaurants are open, how to use the safe etc. It's very useful when you arrive. The staff at the Maya work extremely hard to make your vacation enjoyable. You'll notice this around the pool area and at the beach. I saw most of the staff all day long which means that they work some long hours. The staff behind the scenes (e.g. the cleaners, kitchen staff, waiters, and bartenders) work equally as hard. Travelers, I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, please TIP whenever you can. This is an all inclusive but if you have the luxury to afford travel, you should be able to put aside some money to TIP. The workers do not expect TIP's but it's a good way to show your appreciation for all they do for you. Remember also, most of them are not as fortunate as we are so once again .....PLEASE TIP. We tipped a couple U.S. dollars a day for the cleaners and the same each time we ate at the buffets. We ate the buffet 3 times a day and tipped each time. We tried to stick to the same waiter and once you do that, they'll remember you and always go beyond with the service. Our waiters were Gabriel and Gilmere. Both were really friendly and offered amazing service. We ate at the Italian and Mediterranean a la carte's while we were there. The Mexican a la carte's was closed due to renovations. We tipped about $10 U.S. at each of the a la carte's. My girlfriend and I really enjoyed the food at the buffet (lots of variety and they change it up every meal). The a la carte's offer LIMITED food choices but is nice on occasion. We had read review of people complaining about the buffet. Those must have been some picky people because we loved the food there. I personally preferred the buffet over the a la carte's. We didn't really drink much while we were there as we're not really drinkers. We spent a big part of the day on the beach enjoying the beautiful weather. The weather was perfect for the entire 7 days we were there. We also worked out at the resort gym, 3 times in total. The gym had everything my girlfriend and I needed to get a good workout (free weights, treadmills, elliptical etc). We bought the Chichen Itza tour on the beach and got a much better deal than the resort (about half the price). The Chichen Itza tour is all day long so be prepared to lose a full day of your trip if you decide to go. If you like history and ancient ruins, I highly recommend it. Make sure to ask what you'll be getting with the cost. We got a snack, lunch, admission into the grounds and a couple bottle of waters each so it was perfect. I do recommend that you wake up early enough to eat a good breakfast before you leave (the tour usually leaves around 7:30 and returns at about 8 p.m. so you should have enough time to eat first). I also recommend that you take some extra water and sunscreen. There are a lot of vendors at the site so you'll have opportunities to buy souvenirs. Make sure to bargain and you'll get a good deal. I heard a few tourists complaining about the fact that they didn't like having so many vendors at the site. The vendors there are descendents of the ancient Mayans and this is their ancestral site and land. As such, treat them with dignity and respect. On our next visit to Mexico, we'll do Tulum and Xel-Ha. We didn't want to kill our entire trip going on tours. If you like water activities, I would recommend jet-sking and para-sailing. I wanted to do scuba diving but didn't have the time this trip. You really need about 2 weeks here to do everything, 1 week goes too quick. We took a quick trip to 5th Avenue one evening to buy some souvenirs. It's a good idea to ask the cab driving how much the trip will cost before getting in. The cab to 5th Avenue should cost about $5 U.S. Currency conversion can be done at the hotel and is pretty much as good a conversion as you'll get while in town. While we were there $1 U.S. would get you about 13 pesos. Final word of warning...If you fly with Sunwing, they may try to charge you for extra luggage weight when you're leaving Mexico. We left with pretty much the same weight we came in with and were told we were over by 10 kilos and had to pay $200 U.S. I ended up leaving a few items behind since I didn't have the cash to pay. We were very upset with that policy because Sunwing lets you fly in with whatever weight but nails you on the way out. All in all, an excellent resort and an excellent trip. Highly recommended.

We didn't exactly know what to expect. Having traveled extensively in Latin American countries and staying mostly in people's homes and enjoying the cultural interaction, we wondered if we might not enjoy this kind of vacation. Although you are somewhat on a segregated \"island\" from the rest of the Mexican people, we had wonderful conversations with the staff - cooks, maids, maintenance, pool, restaurant and bar staff. We were treated royally and as friends - a wonderful combination. And the towel animals on our bed each day were wonderful! One of the restaurants on site was under renovation but we enjoyed the other two (Mediterranean and Italian). The food in each was wonderfully presented and very tasty. The buffet was great! There was plenty of variety with special offerings each day. I came not expecting anything special from the buffet but went away more than satisfied with the taste, variety and presentation. And the Watermelon art carvings each day were amazing! Although we were forecasted to have rain for most of the week we were there (Nov 22-29) we actually only had about 2 hours of rain one morning and some rain one day after 10pm. So even the weather put on a good show for us. I have read the reviews of people who rate this resort as the worst. I can only say that they must have been at a different resort!

The room was fine, we were by the adult pool so it was nice and quiet. The a/c was loud as others have mentioned but I liked it as it acted as \"white noise\". The place did smell musty, but hey, you're in a humid climate, get over it!Our fridge was stocked with water, but we asked the maid for some beer and pop and she brought it right away. Same for shampoo and conditioner. The grounds were beatifully kept.I think we had one of the best spots on the beach as far as hotels go. It was nice soft sand, no rocks like further south and not a lot of boats like further north. It did have large sand bags (whales) to help hold in the beach after the hurricanes, but they looked like rocks and acted as mini reefs, so you could snorkel around them and see small fish. The whales at Maya were barely visible, further down the beach they did look bad, but they are saving the beach, what can you do? We never had a hard time finding palapas to lay under, but it was low season, so I'm sure that makes difference. We ate at the buffet the first two nights and thought it was fine,(I would suggest to management that they add lots more plants around and add candes on the tables in the evening and dim lights to get rid of the echoey cafeteria type feel) then we had our first dinner in one of the restaurants and there was no going back. We ate at the restaurants five times. They were all fantastic. It was definitely worth the effort to get up at eight and make reservations. We were there during the low season so I don't know if you can typically get in that many times. Breakfasts were fine, omlettes and eggs to order, yogurt, fruit, juce, coffee. We usually ate lunch at the beach, I lived off guacamole down at the beach snack bar. Pizza as awesome when you got it fresh out of the oven, burgers were good too.The animation staff were all fun and friendly we tried a dance lesson and did the acrobat high wire which was really fun. Drinks were okay, we're not big drinkers, but they did have good brands if you asked for them and they were generous. I have read complaints about the local wine, but I loved it, it's a bit sweet. We walked into Playa several times. Checked out 5th Avenue, touristy, but some wicked looking bars.. We were in luck because there was a jazz festival the week we were there and there were free concerts on the beach for four days. I did a lot of homework and found four ways to do excursions 1) book a tour through hotel or tour company, it's easy but expensive and you have to stop at other hotels to pick people up 2) Hire a driver for the day and go to the places you want to go to, costs more for transportation but less for admission and you can stop and go whenever you feel like it. 3) Collectivos, by far the cheapest way to go $2.50, but if you are in a hotel in Playa, you have to go to the bus terminal which is a $5 cab ride so factor that cost in plus the time stopping to pick people up on the highway. Also they don't stop right at your desination, like Akumal for example, so it can mean long walks.4) Rent a car, good option if you're comfortable driving. The highways were really good. Plenty of signs, I think they had me in mind when they invented \"retournos\" (U turns)however I would not drive in Playa if my life depended on it! We ended up doing option #2 and hired a driver$80, it was great. We did a trip to Tulum$4, they have a beautiful beach there as well as snorkelling in Grande Cenote$9. We also spent two days in Akumal(heaven) ate at La Beuna Vida, snorkeled in Yal Ku Lagoon$9 and swam with the sea turtles$25, unbelievable! Use a guide, they are worth the money, just rent one from the dive shop on the beach. If you walk south along the beach from the turtles to the rocky parts of the shore there are great fossils and washed up coral with lots of iganas sunning themselves. Great photo ops! In summary, we love this part of Mexico and plan on going back to the area. The hotel was fine it was not a five star, it felt like a really friendly, family three star hotel with five star service. My biggest pet peeve was that we didn't se a lot of people tipping. I'm embarrased on their behalf. All inclusive doesn't mean you can't tip. At this hotel maids make $5 day! They depend on tips to live. It doesn't have to be a lot just get a whole bunch of one dollar bills or pesos and reward good service, these people work their tails off to please you, and don't forget the waiters at the buffet . :o)", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Resort\u201d", "Author": "edmontonkain", "ReviewID": "UR50176315", "Content": "First time in the mayans and what a experience.

The beach I will give and 8+ ;as we strolled the beaches past several hotels both north and south of this hotel and it was either equal to or better than the other beaches. Our room was clean; the maids do a very good job, but the air conditioning would not seem to stop at the desired temperature and would get quite downright chilly.

We were all couples from work. One couple had visited the Viva Wyndham Maya a few times before and suggested we take our vacation there. Glad we did. We are from New England and needed a break from the chilly weather. The weather was about 70-75 degrees. We anticipated Tropical Storm Ida to visit us at some point throughout the week but she missed us thankfully. We mainly just relaxed in the sun by the pool and would swim in the ocean. The men did go to 5th Avenue to watch American Football and the ladies went shopping. This was a good experience because you can actually barter with the sales people. If you DO go to 5th Avenue, go in the night as well. The shops are all lit up. We went to Sur Steak House and had initially expected to pay a lot for the check, but it was so reasonable and the food was out of this world! The guys also went golfing at a nearby golf corse. I'm told the cost was rather expensive but when he got off the golf course, he was given a coupon for a different course that included 2 rounds of golf and a 2-person massage for more than half the money they spent. But the course was large and all of the men had a great time golfing. At the hotel, there are the \"staff\" who were all doing games in the day and shows in the night. My faves were Jaime and Madeline. Jaime is very lively and the hotel should be honored to have him there. He whistles loudly which gets your attention and has a lot of spunk. He is loud and a perfect fit for the hotel. Madeline seems very sweet and answered all of our questions about her life as a staff member there. In the night time, they had a \"Miss Maya competition\", \"Mr. Maya competition\", \"70's show\", Madonna show, pop starts show, and a kids show. Some seemed cheesy, but you can tell the performers put in a lot of work into knowing their routines. Great time! There were also great bar tenders. Our group likes to party. At the pool bar, Julio \"JC\" was very attentive to our needs (it helps to tip; the will be grateful for any extra money). At the main bar, Carlos and Manuel were our go-to guys. Gabriel was a great waiter at the buffet and very sweet. We ate at the all-inclusive restaurants and the food and service was great. The food was rather bland at the buffet - definitely go to the Azteca and eat their buffet. The one thing I'd like to see next time is a TV for guests at the bars for sports/news. That'd help guests from leaving the hotel; though they might like that to bring some money to the local merchants. There was an internet room where for $2 you get 30 minutes on the internet. There is no printer there which worried me about our boarding passes at the airport, but we were able to get them at the airport. It would have been nice if there was a wi-fi connection for all the rooms. The airport was surprisingly very clean and updated.

in the end we actually liked being in building 3 though because we could walk out our patio to the quiet pool and although we couldn't go in it because of our kids (who puts a family by the adult pool anyway) we could hit the bar there. armando (great and really friendly) hooked us up with the casadores - the only bar out of 3 that had it. the best things about this hotel were the staff and the beach. although it's been a bit eroded so there is a bit of a drop off to get in to the water from where the palapas are which makes it a bit difficult to watch the kids from the comfort of a bed. there were always plenty of chairs to choose from both by the beach and the pool. we only stayed up for one show our first night there (we hadnt arrived til about 8p) it was fun for the kids - the disney show. again. 9:3p for a kids show. maybe we're not normal but what kids stay up til 10:30-11p? the cappacino / espresso makers were a really nice touch too. not to be rude but there are many europeans in this area. many topless grannies. kids took it in a stride but some may find it a bit difficult for their little ones. i found that many of the europeans were pushy though. they would literally cut in front of you for a drink, to talk to the front desk or in the buffet area. who does that? they never tip either which i think is kind of rude but the staff is still so accommodating. anyway i don't think i'd stay here again. it's hard when you do all inclusive and find yourself eating out to avoid the food. fyi we paid $140/night and probably tipped another $25-$30/day or so between food and drinks. i think there are much better values out there.", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, MI", "Title": "\u201cDream Wedding at Wyndham Maya\u201d", "Author": "Nirefire79", "ReviewID": "UR47980800", "Content": "My wedding was August 28 at Wyndham Maya and it was great in every way! Thanks Marco! Our trip: When we arrived to check in, we received welcome cocktails and were able to check in immediately. We were upgraded to an ocean view room and received vip wrist bands. When we got to our room, a bottle of tequila, 2 bottles of wine and a fruit platter were waiting for us in our room! What a great way to start a vacation! The room was clean and simple. After we settled in, we went to guest services and made our reservations for the a la carte restaurants and met with the wedding coordinator. When we met with Marco, the wedding coordinator, he walked us through everything we needed to do for the ceremony. We picked out flowers, cake, setup and chairs, music and which restaurant we wanted for the reception. All this was super quick and stress free. Food: For our reception, we ate at Portofino, the meditrranean restaurant. Everything was great. We also ate at the mexican restaurant and the Italian one at Azteca-wonderful! We ate at the Italian one twice! The buffet was good, but they served pretty much the same choices everyday. The a la carte restaurants are air conditioned, the buffet is not. Cocktails: plentiful. Service was great at the bars. They made whatever we asked for. After our wedding, they wanted us to do tequila shots with them every time we went up to the bar! Twist my arm! Issues: it rained the day before the wedding and our room flooded. We were in the 2000 building by the beach and pool. There was water pouring out of the phone jack and about 2 inches on the floor! They came to clean it up while we went to dinner. When we got back, there was still water in the bathroom and under the bed. Then the air broke, probably from the water pouring out of the electrical! We were moved to another room, but it was far away from our family, not as nice and was not stocked with anything. No soap, towels, etc. I was just glad my wedding dress didn't get ruined! We also had issues getting water and beer stocked in our mini fridge. We called several times, we even left housekeeping a note with a tip asking for more. We were given 2 of each per day. We were told to take our empty bottles to the bar and fill them up with the water there. We weren't really sure if that was \"drinkable\" water either. Overall, it was a great experience, even with the flood. I would definitely come back again.

The pool bar drinks were served in regular cups and weren't as strong but just right, however the bartender would accommodate any request whether it be less liquor or more. It was great. There was a snack bar right by the pool with food, pizza, fries, burgers, chips, fresh guacamole, etc. There was plenty of shade and sunny area's to sit or lounge. The staff was very friendly and upbeat. We loved Victor!! Make your dinner reservations early as they go very fast. We only dined at the Italian restaurant above the pool bar once but it was awesome! I had a delicious salad, shrimp soup and margherita pizza and strawberry dessert. My fiance had the salmon and grouper appetizer and raviolis. Everything was way better then I even expected. Very gourmet presentation and atmosphere was pleasant. The buffet is where we ate the remainder of our meals and even if you are a picky eater you can always find something to eat. Fresh fruit, salad, pasta, fresh bread, soup, chicken, tacos, and different types of food every day. Mexican, Asian, etc. Including dessert, cake, tarts, fruit and ice cream and more. I tried a different fresh fruit juice every day including pineapple, mango, cranberry, tangerine, etc. For breakfast they served fresh fruit, omelettes made to order every day as well as eggs. Many types of cereal, yogurt, fruit and pastries. Even bloody mary's and champagne and orange juice to help cure last nights drinking. Alonzo our representative was very helpful. We didn't purchase any tours but if we were interested he would have more than accommodated our needs. A $5 taxi can bring you the ferry area which is a very large shopping area.

We were greeted warmly and with a welcome non-alcoholic cocktail. Paulina was quick to get us our room keys, towel cards and directions to our room. Raul took our luggage to our room #2309. Raul had told us we had a nice room, but we had booked a Superior Garden view room so we figured it was just something they were suppose to say. When Raul opened the door to our room we were in awe the \"Garden view\" was overlooking the ocean and the pool! It was beautiful and amazing. We had two queen size beds and a really great tile bathroom with a deeper than normal tub. The balcony was small but perfect for the sunrise and coffee. The only complaints about the room are the balcony did not have a cover so we could not sit outside and watch the storms when it was raining and the room had no dressers to put your clothes into. It did have a closet with ample hanging space. The room had a small fridge with water and some sodas, plus a coffee pot and coffee. To be perfectly honest I would stay in this room over and over again and be very very happy. Specialty restaurants are on a first come first serve basis. You make your reservations at the desk across from where you checked in. You have to be there at 8 am. We made 3 nights of reservations at a time. If you can't make your reservation please let them know there are other guests who would like your reservation. Xul ha The Mayan restaurant at the Azteca was very good with a great atmosphere. Miramare The Italian restaurant at the Maya was not so good, but Juan our waiter was fabulous. Don Diego The Mexican restaurant at the Maya was fantastic in the food and atmosphere. Il Palco The Italian restaurant at the Azteca was very good in the food and the atmosphere. The buffet was good. I always found something good to eat and on Fridays is a Mexican Fiesta. The food is really good. The snack bar at the pool serves a great greasy burger! It's not cooked in to a hockey puck. I had 3 of them while I was there because they were cooked to order and really hit the spot. (not usually a burger person) The bars Pool Bar (swim up) Ok this is where things can get really hazy very fast. Everyone parties at the swim up bar. Shots and drinks flow freely here. It is a really good time. You are all BFF's before it's all over. (Parents realize that the swim up bar is just that a bar. Your children may see or hear something not child appropriate.) All are welcome at the pool bar I just want parents to be aware. Pool Bar (walk up) Good drinks, nice bartenders. Lobby Bar Great drinks and great bartenders. All Bars are self serve meaning you walk to the Bar to get a drink. Bring a large insulated drink cup to cut down on the trips to the bar. There is no wait service for drinks except for at the restaurants. The Beach The best in Playa del Carmen! Plenty of lounge chairs and Palapas. Water is fantastic. The whales (giant sandbags) keep the under tow out of the swimming area. Very safe. Just don't play on the Whales that is not safe. (Parents please remember this...) Tipping Not a city in China! This is what your new friends make their living off of. They have families to support. All inclusive does not mean you don't tip. Especially at the price we pay to stay here. We tipped for every round of drinks, every meal, our maid service, our bellboy. We even brought Paulina chocolates for giving us such a great room. And we were well taken care of. (Both of us are in customer service so we can be critical, but as you can see we were very happy) You should show your appreciation based on how they take care of you. Start out tipping and you will get great service your whole trip. A little bit goes a long way. Welcome breakfast IT'S A TIMESHARE PRESENTATION!!!! Now that you realize that it's a pain in the [--] We think it may be worth it to do. They give you a free week 8 days 7 nights hotel stay. You pay the all inclusive fee of $50 a day. That's $350 a person for the week. $700 per room (2 adults) You have 18 months to use the certificate. Now in Jan, Feb and March a Superior Garden View room is $265 per day, $1,855.00 for the week. (2 adults) If this works you would save $1,155.00. We have emailed the rep at Wyndham to book the vacation they are suppose to contact us with in 20 days we are at day 14. Plus I sent a back up email just in case.... With this you receive VIP service which means you book all your specialty restaurants first, you get a room with a jacuzzi and dressers. The rooms are really nice, But no view!!!! These are at the back of the resort. I would rather have the room I just stayed in with a view. Be nice I can't believe I have to say this, but be nice to the staff. Please, Thank you and a Smile should be easy when your on vacation. I can't tell you how sad it made me to see how rude some of the guests were to the staff. Can't wait to go back!!! Like I said before we are waiting to find out when we are going back.

After reading the reviews we felt like we \"knew what we were getting into\". I have to say we were surprised at how wonderful everything was. A great value for the money. We stayed in the #2 building- close to the beach. We loved the access to the pool, and the beach. The room was adequate - when we wanted more water we asked the maid to leave us more, same with the towels. We did tip her daily as well as any wait staff as they definetly deserve it. The beds were hard- really hard as were the pillows. The room was clean - and everything was well kept- the grounds were immaculate.- It was as clean and tidy as being at Disney World. The beach was beautiful and clean. We felt like this hotel has one of the most beautiful beaches. You can walk for long distances along the beach. There are plenty of beach chairs and lots of thatched cabannas. We would get out to the beach early and \"set up for the day\". The beach towel and big and lush. There are a number of European guest - therefore this is some topless bathing on the beach. The beach vendors were not pushy or plentous. All the staff was friendly and helpful and fun. There is plenty of activity for those who want to stay busy. Wind surfing lessons, kayaks, catamaran, salsa dancing, bingo, bocce ball, wall climbing, trapzee-- it reminded us of a cruise on land. The bar not only had bartenders serving up drinks - with great attitudes - but a soda fountain, fresh juice, ice tea, lemonade and water in dispensers. The patio served food for the major part of the day - fresh pizza, grilled hamburgers, fries, desserts, fresh fruit. The buffet has a full range of options - something for everyone. The resturants need a reservation. Just be sure to think ahead and get reservations set up a day or two ahead. We did not know that Don Diego was open for three days of the week. For some reason we got the impression that they were closed. Unfortunately we discovered they were open when we were leaving. Be sure to ask what days they are open -- We enjoyed the Miramare, but would have like the vairety. We went one night to the Azteca for dinner. The walk is a safe pleasant walk. **Be sure to spray yourself with bug spray before going to the Azteca....that was the only place we encountered mosquitos. The food was nothing to salivate over - but it was clean and filling and did the job. If you are looking for gourment meals this would not be the resort. For us - we did not want to have to think about feeding ourselves - but it was not the central interest of our trip - so we were perfectly satisfied. The atmosphere at the hotel was very pleasant-- guest and staff. We had purchased a \"tour book\" of Playa del Carmen before we went- it saved us money - we took the bus from the airport to Playa and a taxi to the hotel. We took a bus to the ruins in Tulum and did not need a tour. The shopping in Playa was fun also. There is a starbuck across the street for the hotel. I also found that both bars were willing to make a coffee drink for me- i just told them the indgredients and they whipped up a mighty fine \"starbucks\" drink. We loved our week - and only wished we could have stayed a few more days.

On a value to dollar spent basis, I've never gotten more for my money. It was very inexpensive and I wasn't expecting much. They blew me out of the water and exceeded my expectations at every turn. (We spent less than $1,000 per person including flights for a week long trip) They have a beautiful huge beach and pool. There are more than enough chairs at all times- hundreds and hundreds of them, we never had trouble looking for sun or shade, at the beach or pool. The pool towels are huge and lush. The bar has a soda fountain and 9 different non-alcoholic drinks/juices/water iced tea. There isn't drink service on the lounge chairs, you have to get your own, but you will live! The service is amazing- everyone is so friendly. from the front desk to the waiters to the bartenders and cleaning staff. The entertainment staff works like crazy. We never waited for a drink at the bar- which was stocked with top shelf booze and there were so many things to do. Trapeze, massage therapy, dart contests (which were hysterical), archery, water aerobics, stretching looking out over the water each morning, Spanish classes, dance classes, sailing lessons, scuba (including intro classes) and a full service tour desk that will schedule any trips you want (although I recommend looking through trip adviser for recommended tour operators instead- I like to support the small local businesses and they will often customize for you as opposed to cookie cutter tours offered through resorts.) There was a show every night and never a dull moment- there were a hundred things to do each day. The resort was very clean, and kept spotless at all times. The resort was obviously a little bit older and its not something you would find on the front cover of architectural digest- but who cares! The landscape was beautiful. Everything worked great as for sinks, tubs, sliding glass doors, airconditioning etc. The beds were hard as rocks- and the pillows matched, but again- if you want 5 star linens and pillow top mattresses you'll have to pay a lot more than this. The only other thing I can think of is that it can get slippery when its wet- some of the paths, and the pool deck. We were there in the rainy season, so it was wet a lot- we'd get quick little downpours in between periods of mostly sunshine. You really need to wear sandals with rubber soles- I saw a couple people go down while I was there. There are warning signs all over to use caution, its slippery- but its REALLY slippery when its wet. If you've ever considered scuba diving, or are already OW - the diving was as good as Cozumel, with visibility that went on forever and very little current on most dives. The reefs were crawling with life- turtles, octopus, peppermint shrimp, moray eels, barracuda and hundreds of species of fish. For the food. The buffet is about average, but the alla carte Italian restaurants are A+ The breakfast buffet had an omelet station, and a guy at another station who was making eggs over easy/sunny side up. A toaster, tons of breads and fruits and some more traditional Mexican foods, yogurt, cereal, pancakes and French toast, they had cold cuts and cheeses- the only thing I was disappointed about is no bacon or sausage or ham- in the traditional American sense. They have hot dogs cut in half labeled \"sausage\" and the meat cold cuts- don't expect boarshead. It was kinda mystery meat, so my breakfasts were mostly vegetarian- which was fine. Lunch and dinner were similar- they did have a small grill with grilled fresh fish and chicken and a whole bunch of different mexican salsas and sauces to dress them. They had a pasta station with marinara base, a cream sauce base, an arrabiata base and a bolognaise base- and then all kinds of stuff you can add- mushrooms, ham, spinach, etc etc etc. The buffet is huge, there is something for everyone. The snack bar was pizza, hotdogs, nachos, hamburgers, fries, fresh fruit. You can make reservations at one of four ala carte restaurants at the guest services desk. We got a reservation every day without any problem and the restaurants were great. Two on the Maya property and two on the Azteca (sister resort) down the street. The Italian restaurants were best. They had internet access ($2 for 1/2 hour). It is 5 minutes from downtown- and PDC is a very safe neighborhood with a lot of security- you can't just wander in- its like this HUGE gated community. Licensed cabs are always driving in front of the resort, it only takes a second to find one- they are usually right there waiting to offer you a ride. Across the street from the front entrance is a starbucks and a shopping center with a pharmacy and a couple jewelry stores and a whole bunch of souvenir shops.

Another plus this hotel is part of a protected compound where they dont let anyone in that isnt supposed to be here, you dont even have to leave the compound for shopping as a short walk will bring you to a shopping plaza, but if you feel up to leaving and walk into Playa Del Carmen there are amazing shops out there and friendly people, I never once felt threatened or pushed into everything. The beach is amazing, lots of room and you can walk for miles. There arent a lot of people on them that ask you to purchase items. I remember when I was in Jamaica I was asked every 5 min, here you are lucky if you see them twice a day.

It was so much fun. I was there with my husband and 1 year old. The beach was beautiful, the resort activites were plentiful. The staff was super friendly and attentive. (I have been to many resorts and the staff can make it or break it. Everyone here was so friendly and polite). The good: We stayed in building 3. It is a little farther from the pools, beach and activities, however it's quiet, newer, right next to the Kid's Club (for children 4 and up), the gym, spa and Archery. It was the perfect location for us, as we needed quiet for our son's nap time. Our room had a king bed, a sofa, a small table and two chairs, TV, minibar, a big bathroom with a large marble shower AND deep jacuzzi tub. Housekeeping was efficient and I loved that they left us plenty of bottled water to make formula for the baby. There was so much to do there, from dance and exercise classes, to sports, crafts and of course all you could eat and drink. Want top shelf liquor? Just ask (no extra charge). We were sorry that the daily shows (in the big outdoor theater, with lights,costumes, makeup, etc) didn't start until 9:30PM, however, so I only got to sneak out to one, while my husband watched the baby. I also loved my Xocolat (Chocolate) Pedicure at the Renova spa on property. My legs never felt so soft and the spa treatment smelled great. If you want souvenirs there is a little plaza just outside of entrance to resort (truly only a walk down a short driveway). We bought gifts there. You can haggle at some of the shops. And if you must have your Starbucks there is one right there, in that plaza. Also, take advantage of the sister resort, The Viva Wyndham Azteca, just a few resorts down (5 minute walk). You can dine and play there too. We ate dinner at one of their restaurants, Xul-ha, the location was cool. It was kind of like being in a jungle. (Bring your bug repellent, however. That is the only place that I was bit by a mosquito all week!) The bad: The crib! The crib that was provided by the hotel was a complete safety hazard. It was 1/2 the size of a traditional crib (and shorter). It was made of wood, with WIDE gaps (slats), no crib bumber and metal latches (on the inside of the crib). Our son spent his time biting the wood, the metal latches and hitting his head each time that he tried to lie down (because it was so small). Needless to say, he only stayed in there for about an hour. We had to put him in bed with us. Neither my husband nor I got ANY sleep the first night. Ugh! The following day I ran out to the Centro Maya (mall across the street) and bought a \"corral\" (play pen). My advice to you-BRING YOUR OWN PACK N' PLAY! It's totally worth the hassle. You will actually sleep at night. Our son slept great the rest of the week. Coincidentally, one of the managers of the hotel had a baby this week. So I left the \"corral\" there for him. The hallway doors are also thin. So bring earplugs, if you are light sleeper. People love to come back to their rooms, talking, singing etc after the show and disco. You can hear it all.

I recommend buying it off the guys who sell it on the beach, ours had a state id. oh and i got a massage at the spa, two thumbs up!", "Date": "September 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City", "Title": "\u201cBetter than I expected!

The hotel exceeded my expectations in many ways. He and I are already planning our return. We arrived at the hotel at 12:30 pm and were able to check in immediately. The front desk staff was very helpful and the glass of welcome champagne didn't hurt either. We ended up in the 2000 building, between the lobby and the pool. The room was clean and sufficient. . . . not as updated as the 3000 building, but I'd take the older room closer to the action any day. The food was always good, but not really gourmet. I am a vegetarian and never had a problem finding numerous options for any meal. We ate at the Italian restaurant one of the nights. The food was very good, the view was pretty awesome, but the restaurant was very HOT. There was very little breeze and no AC. The activities and entertainment were much better than expected. There was always something to see and do, but it didn't get in the way of simple relaxation. My husband and I decided to wait until we got to Mexico to book our excursions and found that doing so through the hotel was very easy. The prices they offered were comparable to any other tour provider, but the level of service was unparalleled. I highly recommend the catamaran trip to Tulum. Apparently, booking it through the Wyndham Maya hotel is cheaper than booking it through some other resorts in the area. There were a couple of people on our tour who were very upset that they paid so much more than we did. My husband and I were able to get a direct flight to Cancun and 5 nights/6 days at the resort for under $1,000.

Now that's out of the way, lets get to my review. Dates: August 30 - September 6, 2009 Vacancy - I'd say about 40-50% full Arrival: No line up @ 2:30pm, we were greeted with 2 cold non-alcoholic beverages and the check in was painless and quick, they were nice enough to tell us that the main buffet was closing for lunch (3pm) and should get a bite to eat before they closed (I forgot about the one by the pool). Room: We were located in building #3000, room #3119, by the adult/relax pool. Room was clean and tidy with 1 king size bed, working refrigerator and a working air conditioner (yes it was loud, but every night it was too cold to leave on, so we turned it off as I sleep shirtless). Yes, it was a 5min walk to get to the beach, but it was also updated/renovated compared to building #2000 on the right facing the beach, which I was told was not as nice as ours (old style/painting, no 'window' into the bathroom and without 2 sinks) . The other building #1000 to the left while facing the beach was being renovated. There was a separate 'room' for the toilet, a standup shower and the Jacuzzi was located on the other side of the sink with a 'window' to the bedroom (a romantic touch). BEWARE the floors are marble and are slippery when wet. The bed was kind of hard, but after a day of drinking and in the sun who really cares. Out of all the days we stayed, we did notice 1 spider which we took care of right away. Other than that the maids keep it and the fridge was always stocked 2 carbonated drinks & 2 bottles of water everyday. (*TIP the maids a dollar or 2 everyday*) Pools/Beach: The adult/relaxation pool is great for anyone that don't like to hustle and bustle of the main pool, 1 exception is that yes you do have to get out of the pool to get a drink. The main pool was busy and yes ppl do stay a long time by the swim-up bar. The animation team always had something to do through out the day and if you weren't feeling to tipsy or just plain lazy you can join in on the fun (they asked and were polite if you didn't want to participate). Beach loungers were always re-arranged back to their positions when it was dark, the beach was raked clean and cups and plates?!? were cleaned up as well. There are stations/garbage cans on the beach where you should put empty cups or plates. There is a big sign stating not to reserve the loungers with towels, but ppl did anyways and I did it as well, but if you don't mind being in the sun, the time we were there you can find a lounger no problem. (side-note: our last night we met a couple that had a small ipod dock with speakers and had a full moon beach party (well sort of, we asked other ppl to join, some did and some didn't) we drank and chilled out on the beach until the batteries died, the security will wonder what you are doing/if you are staying @ Wyndham, but be polite and they will leave you be) Bars/Drinks: There are 4 bars to get drinks from 1 by the adult/relax pool, 1 by the disco, 1 by the lunch buffet by the pool and of course the swim-up bar. Basically every bar is the same, just ask for the good stuff (ie: Tequila = Souza) don't just ask for a Tequila shot as they will give you Jose Curevo = stomach problems, if you drink like a fish TIP a dollar or 2 to your favorite bartender and he will take care of you. (Note: bring a plastic insulated mug to keep your drinks cool, we brought a Bubba Keg 52oz and didn't have to go to the bar too often and drinks stayed cold, ppl wanted to know where we purchased one, and yes we did tip the bartenders because of the size) I also heard that the bars at Aztec is 24hrs, never went though. Food/Restaurants\u2019: The main buffet: Lots of choices, breakfast has an omelets station and for lunch and dinner it is a pasta station. The staff keep the food topped up and the waiters/waitresses keep your drinks full and tables clean of empty pla(Note: if you want some sort of breeze go to the room closer to the beach), I understand that if you do stay 2 weeks you could be tired of the food, but there are a total of 6 al la carte restaurants between Maya and Aztec, book them and go to them to try them out, worst comes to worst you go into Playa del Carmen for lunch/dinner. Miramar - Italian @ Maya - I had the Cheese & Spinach Ravioli (a little under done), Grouper (really nice) and we shared the Flamb\u00e9 Strawberries. She had the Lobster Carpaccio (small), chicken (kind of dry). Overall okay and it is the restaurant above the pool bar, so no air conditioning. Don Diego - Mexican @ May - I had the Al Pastor (okay), Acherra (OMG so tender/melts in your mouth) and Flamb\u00e9 plantations. She had the Cheese Mushroom wrap (too much cheese), Peblano (sp?) cream soup (really good) and Leche cake. This was the best out of the 2 a la cartes we went to hands down. We also tipped after every meal at the buffet or a la carte, you can also try out the buffet @ Aztec. Service/grounds/cleaning: Great service all around, maybe 1 night the late night bar staff was a little grumpy, but who hasn't has a bad day @ work. People said hola/hi if you made eye contact or said hola/hi. There was always some one at any time of the day cleaning/cutting/arranging something. Activities/indemnities: Always something to do and yes there are bicycles that you can use into town (3 hours @ Maya, no restrictions @ Aztec, which you can use as well, just ask for a lock) Overall - Yes, there are probably better resorts out there, but for the overall value, comfort, cleanliness, and location, this place was awesome for our first time in the Mayan Rivera.", "Date": "September 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "east coooast", "Title": "\u201cGreat for the price.

The main restaurant is for buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner. You can also make reservations for the Viva Azteca, which is walking distance from the Maya. I know that is was all inclusive, but it does not hurt to tip. A little tipping goes a long way. The main restaurant is not air conditioned. The good news is it is casual. The choices are pretty robust. If you don't find anything you like, you probably are never happy. The other 3 restaurants are fine. If you are looking to put long pants on, they're pretty good. The drinks are tasty, but make sure you ask for the good stuff. They are daily activities throughout the week.As far as the nightly shows, I'm not really into them, but they are good for kids. There are daily activities poolside through out the week. The better option is to take a $5 cab ride downtown where they pretty much have every type of club available. As far as the rooms, the only complaint I have is the LOUD AIRCONDITIONER. The beach is awesome. Be sure to check out Scuba Caribe, the on site dive shop. They are the most laid back, fun and professional dive center I have ever been to. They also have other activities besides diving. Make sure you check out the Cenotes, they are a bunch of them in Playa del Carmen. Overall, you can not beat the price. It is not luxury, but it's very decent.

Definitely would recommend this resort. We're members, so we got a bit of special treatment, but you don't need to be members to have a great time. We had a room in the 1000 wing (right next to the water), but opted to move the to 3000 wing after some small problems. The 3000 wing overlooks the Relax pool and is very nice. It's a bit of a walk to the beach, but the rooms are nicer than 1000 wing. It appears (???) the entire 2000 wing is currently closed for remodeling (Sept 2009). We could see lots of people doing work there. So....a couple months from now, the 2000 wing might be the place to be! Staff there is fantastic! Bartenders are very nice and pour great drinks. Bring or buy a larger insulated cup if you don't want to go the bar ever 10 minutes. The pool and pool bar are great. Pool and pool areas are very clean. 9:30pm shows are quite entertaining. Animation staff are cool and work very hard. The beach has perfect white sand and the sea is the most perfect turquoise color. Even though it was low-season, it's still hard to get shade seats if you don't get to the beach by 9 or 10. Inconsiderate people reserve the seats early and (seemingly) never come back. We did have a problem getting basic supplies re-stocked (toilet paper, towels, etc.), but once we spoke to management, the problem was quickly resolved. We got nabbed by the Palace folks right at the airport, asking us to do the timeshare presentation. It seemed like some sort of \"official\" visit (since it was in the airport), but it was your standard timeshare crap. Even though we're Wyndham members, we agreed to attend their \"grand opening\" at the Adventure Spa. The gifts were fantastic (day pass, cheap excursions, discounts, etc), but it was 3 hours of our vacation we won't get back. The tour was great, but the sales pitch was uber-intense. We ended up paying $75, but got 2 tours, a day pass and cheap golf. All-in-all, it was a good deal, but the gal at the airport said there's no way it would be more than 90 minutes.... If you do their presentation just for the gifts, cut them short as much as you can (unless you want to buy). It sounded like a good deal, but we\u2019ve already got a vacation club membership. We did Tulum and Isla Mujeres excursions. Tulum was very interesting, but very hot the day we were there. Mujeres tour was cool, the staff on the boat were very entertaining. We visited 5th avenue too, there a lot of shops and cool bars, but I hate being accosted by vendor begging you to visit their stores. All in all, a great trip.

We thought that for the money we paid, this was a great deal. We rented a car at the airport and although the part where you make the u-turn for the hotel was well-marked, there was no signage that indicated that Playacar was where we were actually supposed to turn in. We ended up driving around a bit before finally asking a policeman. Check-in was quick and painless and they greeted us with champagne glasses of cold pink grapefruit juice. We were hot and starving so this was much welcomed. They accidentally gave us a room that was already occupied, but the wonderful bellman who was bringing our luggage to our room told us to grab a drink at the nearby bar and he went back up and got us reassigned with new keys. The room was fine. The air conditioning was great and we didn't find it noisy. As others have stated, it would have been nice to have had a dresser or another luggage rack or two to put suitcases on. We didn't have a great view from our room because we had the kayak hut right outside our door, but we were on the first floor so it was just steps to the beach. The maid did a great job of cleaning up all of the sand and left some very nice towel origami each day. They seem to be in the process of renovating rooms, but we were never disturbed by any noise and I was actually amazed at how quiet it was. The gratuities were also included in our price, but we tipped the bartenders and maids a couple dollars each day and tipped the waiters at the sit-down restaurants about $10/night. We are never confident in who or how much to tip, but figured since it was already included, anything over and above that would be appreciated. The staff seemed to be gracious and accommodating regardless of whether you tipped or not, but with the Mexican tourism having been decimated by the media's sensationalizing the flu outbreak, I'm sure it's appreciated. The first night we ate at the buffet because you have to make reservations for the restaurants. We had tried to call a few days early to do that, but you can't make reservations until after you have checked in and then you need to make them each morning at 8am for that same night. My husband is a foodie and hates, buffets, but he gave this one two thumbs up. They had a huge selection of food and desserts so there was something for everyone. Unfortunately the buffet is not air conditioned, but if there is a breeze, it's not too bad. We ate at the buffet for breakfast and lunch and all were good with a wide variety. We also ate lunch at the snack bar a couple times and that was simple, but fine. We managed to get dinner reservations for two nights. One we ate at Portofino and while my son grumbled at having to wear pants, it was air conditioned and had excellent service. We didn't find the food to be any better or worse than the buffet, but it was a nice presentation. The other restaurant we went to was at the nearby partner hotel, Wyndham Azteca. It was Bambu with an asian theme. It was about a 10 minute walk up the street and it was also good. The staff was very nice and helpful. We liked the variety of guests from different countries in Europe and South America. The multi-lingual staff were very impressive. My daughter loved the trapeze. She and I also did stretching, water aerobics, step class, archery, salsa dancing and the catamaran tour together. They did the kids club for a little bit, but we were happy to have them with us. My son and husband snorkeled and kayaked right off the beach and the kids did the little diving tutorial they had in the pool. We loved the beach and the water was so nice and warm. I'd recommend putting more than a towel on a chair to reserve it as I had snuck out early one morning and reserved two chairs under a palapa only to come back later that morning and find people on them. We stayed up to watch two of the shows and the staff are very talented. There seems to be a pre-show where the kids get to perform at 9 and my daughter loved the chance to be on the stage. Stargazing was great at night. We had the opportunity to see mayan ruins and go cave tubing and ziplining on a previous trip to Belize and Costa Rica, so we had decided to make the most of the all-inclusive and just stay at the resort and relax. Our vacations are usually more adventure or culture-focused, so this was a bit of an experiment. It got a low-average rating from the family, but that was only because we decided that this type of vacation wasn't for us. I'm sure if we had booked the snorkel tour to Cozumel or went to any of the many other attractions the area has to offer, it would have bumped the score up. Overall I feel sort of lukewarm about it because I think the Wyndham Maya was a great value for us, but we just ended up not being resort-type people.

Those you have to reserve at the desk across the reception. You may eat 3 times a week in these restaurants. In all restaurants the food was amazing! Beach/swimming pool: We always went to the beach and not to the pool. Simply because the water of the sea was a bit colder than in the pool and there were some activities in the pool during the day. The beach was awesome, gorgeous white sand, everything very clean and neat. The sea was to die for and due to the sand bags not too many high waves.

The shows at night were pretty good especially compared to the shows at the bahia principe in samana which was my last trip. The disco was pretty happening mainly a young crowd but at 12 all the under 18s got kicked out thats also when the entertainers went home and the disco slowed down maybe it was just my week. But it was a nice disco food and drinks: I thought the food was good i never had any problems no one got sick and there was lots of variety i dont know what people are talking about when they said the food had weird smells. everything was fresh and really good all teh a la cartes we went to were amazing except for the mayan at the other hotel the food was weird. And since i was there in august it was overwhelmingly hot eating in the buffet or the italian restaurant but we dealt with it. The food at the snack bar was good in the day but at night i wouldnt touch it they didnt really serve night snack friendly foods the one night i checked it was like pork beef and rice who wants that at 3am. The drinks were also very good franciso at the pool bar always made sure my cup was full even if it meant coming to find me with a drink! hotel crowd: Since we went in summer thats when a lot of europeans go. at first i was like oh great no one speaks english. then some of the entertainers decided to set me up with people which was a bit akward but funny. in teh end we met a bunch of canadians and americans and had a great time.

Like the title of my review says, the Viva is a great value. Our 4 night stay with airfare was under 1200 bucks. Considering airfare took up half of that at least, and it's an all inclusive resort, that's a lot of bang for your buck! We couldn't find any inclusive resorts in the states or the entire rest of the Caribbean that could come close to that. I tried getting reservations for the restaurants our second morning there and there weren't any available. I wasn't too surprised since I read similar experiences before we left. The food overall is so so at the buffet and snack bar. Maybe 5 out of 10. The buffet isn't air conditioned so it can be very uncomfortable at times. Try to get a seat near the window if you can. The beach is awesome. Clean, soft, sand and clear blue water. It's beautiful and simply heavenly to swim in. It's hard to get a shady spot on the beach so expect that. In the direct sun on the beach the heat can be brutal. Load up on the sunscreen and hit the water often! You can see some hotels and cruise ships on Cozumel (island off the shore directly across from Playa del Carmen) which is cool too. Don't forget about the beach at night! Before the 9:30 shows my wife and I would grab some drinks and sit on a chair down by the water. It's so dark and peaceful at night. With the stars, moon and glow of lights on Cozumel it's a great atmosphere. The main pool area by the beach can be very noisy during the day. Lot's of kids yelling, loud music, activity directors trying to round up people for things to day, tour salesmen, people selling jewelry and sunglasses, you get the picture. I'm not saying it's awful but we enjoyed the \"relax pool\" (adult pool) much more. Speaking of the adult pool, it was our favorite spot on the resort. It's very quiet. A great place to relax and snooze on a deck chair. We never had a problem finding a shady spot and there were very few people there most of the time. Armondo the bartender kept our glasses full with a smile. No snacks back there but oh well. The nightly shows were cheesy but not bad. They had the kids and some guests participate in the shows which was cool. We went to the disco for about 30 minutes one of the nights but all they played was tecno and neither of us like to dance to that much. The big patio by the lobby bar is very cool at night. Nice place to sit and have a drink. Speaking of drinks we had no problem there. Lots of tropical drinks to choose from as well as standard cocktails. At the main bar they had Dos Equis on tap and at the adult pool they poured beer out of big 40 ounce bottles. I think that was Sol but not sure. Our room was ok. We stayed in room 3236 which is in the building farthest from the beach. The balcony was very tiny and we had a view of the resort next door. I would have loved to have an ocean view but we're cheap and didn't hang out in the room much anyway. The AC worked great as well as the TV, shower, etc. My only gripe is no coffee maker!! That was especially hard the day we had to leave. Up at 4:30 in the morning and no place to get a cup of joe. As far as activities go I can't comment there. We spend all our time being lazy and didn't do a darn thing. Well, I could go on and on all day but you've probably lost interest by now and have moved on to the next review. In case you didn't get the gist we really loved this place and recommend it!! Two final tips - be sure to bring a pen on the plane. You have to fill out forms for customs and they don't have any at the airport. Some airlines might lend them out but our flight attendants on Continental didn't have pens to lend. Also, right before you reach the main doors to go outside to ground transportation at the airport there are lots of tour and excursion salesmen. If you have a ride lined up already the people you need to see are outside. Just tell the guys inside no thanks and head out the door.", "Date": "August 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "albany, ny", "Title": "\u201cStay Away From Viva Vacation Club\u201d", "Author": "LovesToTravel233", "ReviewID": "UR38245813", "Content": "The hotel was great - food was very good.

When I told him I just wanted to know about the club, he got very offended. THis continued for about another 30 minutes. His manager Patrick then came over and laid out the plan for us - which is much more expensive and less for the money than our current plan - twice as expensive actually. We declined and Patrick then started mumbling about our decision to EJ the rep, in front of us! I asked to speak to a manager and was told these were standard customer service practices and that no one did anything wrong or inappropriate.

Upon first arrival at the Wyndham Maya I was a bit put off by the size of it. I was expecting a much bigger resort. After day 1 the size did not matter. When we checked in we received a welcome cocktail, about 30 minutes after we arrived in our room we were sent a bottle of wine, which the bellhop opened and poured for us. Another day we received a cheese platter. Room: We were on the first floor (rm 1103) with a patio that led out to the beach, the only problem was that it was off to the side and had a view of thehut where you signed up for watersports. Otherwise the room was a good size, decent furniture and air conditioning was working. The room did not have dressers for your clothing. There were some open shelves you could use but were not ideal. There was a mini bar that was refreshed everyday. We left a note asking for more water and was given 3 -5 bottles per day...it helped that we left a $3 tip each day. Food: Buffet did get repettive but there was always something for everyone. Left the waiter $2 at each meal and we were guaranteed good service & little extras. We ate at all 3 specialty restaurants and enjoyed the food as well as the ambiance. Alcohol: In abundance...top shelf is available all you have to do is ask. Pool: did not use the pool near the beach area as it was always crowded, difficult to find a lounge chair. There was a swim up bar and snack buffet in this area. This was also where the activities took place. I did utilize the adult pool that is in the newer section of the hotel. Here you were able to have quiet and actually snag a lounge chair with an umbrella. There is also a bar in this area but no food. Beach: clean with ample loungers. As others have indicated it is difficult to find a spot with an umbrella. Despite a sign saying not to reserve the lounge chairs everyone does it. Staff: No problems with any of the staff. All were friendly, polite and accommodating. Make sure you hit some of the clubs on 5th Ave. The resort can get a little boring if you do not leave it. You should avoid the vendors at the hotel and go directly to Playa Mart on 5th Ave as they offer the best prices. Overall we had a positive experience at the Viva Wyndham Maya.

The service, especially from the wait/food service staff was incredible. I am very picky about servers because in the US we encounter many rude, incompetent, or just lazy servers. These servers were not working for tips (though we tipped sometimes even in the buffet because they were terrific) though they behaved like it...Why can't our servers at home be this good??? They were always there to fill drinks or get us anything we needed (one even offered to refill our water bottle before we left dinner...?). One review mentioned that the buffet had a cafeteria feel, but each table had fresh cloth linens, a table setting with glass glasses and silverware, and cloth napkins at each meal, not sure how many cafeterias have this! Food...The food at the buffet was amazing in it's variety, we have two picky eaters and they were thrilled. They probably have 10-15 different choices of meats at each meal, the same for breads, salads, etc. I found the food to be quite good, I always found something that was yummy. The fish was the most tender I have ever tasted, and I am not a huge fish fan. The desserts, aside from the delicious ice cream was something to pass up, as it all seemed made from very little sugar. However, I was so full from dinner a little ice cream hit the spot. We ate dinner at the Miramar and it was wonderful, very well presented and yummy! Yes, it can be hard to get reservations, and when they say it is full it does not mean full, many tables are empty, but this simply makes it less crowded and makes for a nicer dinner. Pools...We swam in the ocean every day, only hit the adult pool once for a lap swim and although some tiles were old, it was very clean. The rooms...One warning...The first room we had was on the ground floor, near the beach, on northeast side of the building (room 1107?). It was a little dark and the patio looked out over the back of the water sports shack. After taking showers (the tub did not drain very well) the humidity in the room was amazingly high (of course, it is high everywhere down there, but this was bad), the floors were wet, as well as many other surfaces. We thought it would be dry by morning, but it didn't, the floors were still wet! We told them this room would not do, and asked for another room. Without hesitation, and though the resort was full, they moved us to the second floor, a beautiful room with dry floors...:) and a gorgeous ocean view. We were very happy there the remainder of our stay. Hint: If staying in the building nearest the beach, ask for an ocean view room - gorgeous! Yes, you do need to get your towels out to the chairs early (by 7:30 or 8:00 am) to get shade. Get your hotel towels the night you arrive. We took the Dolphin Adventures trip, it was terrific, we were shuttled to and from at no extra charge by the Dolphin Adventure Staff. The sand bags definitely are not pretty, probably one of the few negatives of this resort. Because the hotel was full, we could only check out snorkle gear for one hour a day...this was a negative, as we like to have our gear handy whenever we want to go out. You may wish to bring your own gear if you want to snorkle a lot. The drinks from the bar ranged from okay to great, margaritas were blah, Bailey's on ice was heavenly! I suggest getting your drinks from the bar near the front desk when possible (glass glasses and possibly better drinks). The snack bar was more than snacks, it had a full range of chicken, nacho ingredients, sometimes fish, hot dogs and hamburgers, salads, and desserts. I cannot understand the reviewers that whined about this...???

Great value for $ at the Viva Maya. Jacuzzi, pool w/ swim up bar, separate relax pool for adults only, gorgeous beach. All inclusive is above and beyond what I expected--- got to ride the catamaran, great food, very decent drinks from simple ones to fancy at the bars, staff very friendly! Here are some specifics to clear up some issues ppl have been having. Do yourself a favor and reserve the a la carte restaurants for as many nights as possible. We did them 6 out of our 8 nights. Because these restaurants offer QUALITY 3-4 course meals (included in your all inclusive plans), they only allow for 20 reservations per restaurant per night. You are given 3 reservations in advance, and after that it is first come, first serve. You will go to the restaurants and see tons of open tables, but like I said, because they maintain a much higher quality than the buffet, I believe they only give away so many meals. We always were able to reserve in the morning, or if not, there was always a cancellation when we checked back. And they offer you the sister hotel restaurants as well, so there is plenty of variety (6 la cartes, i believe...from Italian to Mediterannean, Mexican, and Oriental too...). IT IS WORTH THE EFFORT TO BOOK THESE, you will feel like you have gone out for a special/nice dinner. Quite fancy. Dinner buffet...not so hot....the temperature IS hot which is a bit unpleasant and the buffet food fairly bland. Breakfast buffets are much better. Lunch, kind of eh as well...sort of fast food/frozen meal-like....we always did breakfast, had some tasty chips and guacamole/salsa by the pool in the afternoon, and did the a la cartes at night. TONS of activities, from games, trapeze, and land sports to water sports (both included and ones for additional price like waverunning etc.). Never a boring moment. Staff is very enthusiastic and makes great efforts to round up ppl. Fun and relaxed atmosphere. Shows at night are hit or miss. First night was delightfully corny. But went another night and it was QUITE impressive and professional! Either way its a good time and many people go. Also, DON'T miss the specialty drinks in the courtyard from 7-9 pm in the evenings. VERY quality, unique, and specialized drinks. These will be the best ones you get in the all inclusive plan!

So, I promised myself that I would post a review when we returned to ease the mind of all of the other families getting ready to travel to this resort...you are going to have a great time! The truth is that the rooms are clean, well kept. We did have a tiny little ant problem but really not a big deal. I would go back anyway. Our air conditioner WAS very loud as many have mentioned but it was actually a blessing because we had a room close the main stage where all the shows were and this meant a lot of noise until at least 10:30 every night. So, if you have young children, mine are 7 (twins) and one of them liked to go to bed early so the air conditioner muffled the noise and sleep was not a problem. I must say that the biggest issue I had with noise was the paper thin walls and the noise that came from other rooms. It made me nervous thinking others could hear us talk and our TV. Food...breakfast was great-many healthy and not so healthy choices for all. Lunch...fast food type food. Not much variety. My son ate fries with cheese every day. Not good but he had fun. Needless to say we are all on a diet right now. We stayed at the pool all day so we never ate in the buffet room at lunch. I assume the variety is better. The only problem is that it is a pain to walk over when you are all wet. The pizza was okay. Guacamole and salsa very fresh. That is what i ate everyday. Dinner in the main room was HOT so we were a little annoyed and lost our appetite. Literally we dripped with sweat. The two restaurants were outstanding and I reccommend you take advantage of the a la carte choices you have. Don't believe the others who said they did not get reservations...they are included in your stay so PUSH for them. You must go for the change of pace. Buffet eating can get boring. Also..you must take a 10 minute walk over to the Aztyeca the sister hotel to eat at lunch of dinner-seems fresher and cooler. We hate in the courtyard type area just outside of the buffet room and we loved it. We did that twice. Nice to walk too. We stopped at the vendors just outside of the resort as well. Good prices. Starbucks was a nice reminder of home. Take a 5 minute 5 dollar taxi ride to 5th avenue one night. Very nice stores-pricey though. The port is a nice site to see. We went to Carlos and Charlies for our last night dinner. It was awful and not worth the money. Had icecream and walked around. The shows were great. Funny and entertaining. I can't believe how hard and long the entertainment staff worked. They really try so hard to get people involved all day..bingo, water aerobics, polo, yoga, dancing lessons etc. I did nothing...just wanted to hang out at the pool all day. The kids did too! Last word of advice....when you get to the cancun airport and if you have already prebooked your taxi with any company ( don't prebook just pick up a taxi and pay the same amount of money to go straight to the hotel instead of stopping at others. The ride is long and bumpy) go straight passed the many people working to get your money. Someone will no doubt ask you for your taxi info and you just say its okay and keep heading for the taxis outside. There is no need to stop even if they look like they are official. We we sucked into buying a package we never used....just keep walking. At the resort you will be approached by many nice people who pretend to want to make your stay great-they want you to attend a time share type session. They will tell you that you will get free this and that and you will not get it. It will be a waste of time and time on our holiday was precious. It is 2 hours we will never get back. Unless of course you have 10 to 12 thousand dollars to spare. Just say no thank you and enjoy the time you have at the resort. The beach is great, the pool is great for kids because it is 4 feet everywhere you stand. So no deep end to worry about for younger kids. My boys got a kick out of the swim up bar. They ordered fruit smoothies all day and night too! If you are comfortable letting your kids be away from you all day then they can be part of the kids club all day. \\The staff there is great and they will keep your kids busy for you. My boys chose to hang out at the pool. The whole waking up at 6 for a spot is kind of true....I woke up at 8 and still got a spot under the umbrellas at the pool. Some spots on the beach too. We tried to get at least two on the beach under an umbrella and two at the pool. We cheated but very necessary considering the heat can really get to you. A great place for the family, for the price and all round good choice. I will go back. Oh and nothing was stolen from our room as far as we know!

I booked prior to Flu outbreak and began monitoring reviews for many months. If you have not booked this hotel, then pay attention to the the next several reviews. I travelled with husband and kids (17, 15, 13) for 6 days/5 nights and knew going in I might have a few issues but thought I could overlook. We arrived at 11:00 am and didn't get checked in til 2:00 so throw a bathing suit in your carry on! I wasn't greeted with cocktails (as stated) but given a wrist band to get something to eat. I requested adjoining rooms but was given two rooms across from one another. Good thing! The toilet in the girls' room was broken but \"fixed\" the first day. It did, however, break again on day 4. I made the report two days in a row. It got fixed when my husband and I stayed at the front desk demanding they follow up with maintanence. We were met at the room and watched them actually make the repair. Something we could have lived with but not convenient, that's one of the pros to having 2 roms for family of 5. Plus, it was not fun going across the hall any time we needed to \"go\"... My major complaint is also with the food. They are running some type of scam with their restaurants. I tried making reservations on arrival (per reviews) and told it was booked until our 5th day there, but \"to check back for cancellations\". One night for kicks, we asked the \"captain\" of the mexican restaurant, Don Diego, if there were cancellations since we could see the restaurant was half empty! We were told no. I asked at Customer Service what the deal was and heard some story about 1/2 hour seatings. While we ate on our 5th night at El Portofino (which was good) we witnessed 9 filled tables out of 30 available! Every 30 minutes they seated two more tables. What kind of nonsense is this? I paid for two ocean view rooms, ate the same old buffet crap 24/7 and were only allowed 1 sit down meal? I should have forced the issue more, but didn't know at the time just how sick I'd get of the buffet! I stayed in room 1306 (the toilet is fixed now, thanks to us!) and had a great working AC, comfy beds, but watch for cups with water, etc, that might draw ants. We had a million marching everywhere! Husband and son stayed in 1309, which was fine, and had almost checked in to 1305 (king bed, MUSTY!). Location is great to the beach. Couldn't hear a sound outside of our room and didn't really need to have Ocean front since i didn't spend time on the balcony due to heat. Agree that activities are great if you take advantage of them. Beautiful waters, snorkeling (1 hr free) is okay around the whales (sandbags). Shows provide amusement, some nights better than others. We were told too late to complain to the Viva VIP staff and they would tell the owners/managers. If you go and see these issues continue (esp. the restaurant) then do so and see what you can get.

I read lots of reviews and looked at many photos before going. First off, the food was awful. We lived on fries and chicken from the pool snack bar. We are not picky eaters but the food at the buffet was totally tasteless. We figured that they have to cater to so many nationalities that they don't season the food. Presentation is good but no taste. We met quite a few people and that was the major complaint amongst all of them. Also, the buffet restaurant is so hot you lose your appetite. We ate at Miramar one night and it was so-so. Service was good. The rooms. We stayed in a room close to the beach and pool and were very satisfied with the location. Our friends stayed in the new building(3) and although their room was much nicer it was very far to walk especially in the heat. Our tv didn't work very well(which we watched at night and when we needed to get out of the sun for a while)and the bed was extremely hard and the pillows were very flat. I asked for softer pillows the third morning and they were delivered in a timely fashion. Much better but still not as nice as the newer building. Also, be aware that if you're travelling during the summer months, the humidity is awful. I come from Texas, and I'm used to some but not like Mexico. I couldn't sleep very well because the airconditioner in the room keeps coming on after a few minutes. It is loud like others have mentioned in previous reviews. At first it wasn't so bad, but after a couple of days it wears on you. Room was kept clean and the housekeeping staff was terrific. I was happy though that we were very close to everything. The beach. I have to say that the beach was awesome and the water was wonderful. I did get up very early to save a palapa and have coffee in the morning. The cappucinos at the beach bar were the best along with the pastries they put out first thing. If you don't save a place in the shade, you will have a hard time in the sun. Many people got sunburned their first day and were miserable. My advice is to use waterbabies sunblock as we do(we are hispanic and still tan through it) so as not to ruin your vacation. Our friends used ours since it worked better than the sport sunblock. I was kind of disappointed with the staff, that they didn't come to the beach to announce activities at the pool but they work very hard and are all very nice. The pool was very, very warm so only used it a couple of times. Also, if you like the pool better than the beach the chairs get taken up quickly so get down early. Be aware that some of the people who stay here don't think that they should wait in line. Very rude and treat staff badly. Bartenders good but sometimes understaffed. The shows were fun for me and my daughter, kind of cheesy as others have said, but I appreciate the kids who put them on. They work so hard during the day and then at night they have to perform in the shows. I think they do a great job. Met a few of them and they are so kind and upbeat and always have a smile on their faces. Playa. A word to the wise. Buy your souvenirs and liquor the first day into playa. I kept putting it off and spent way too much on taxis. Just get it out of the way and leave it in the room. Also, if you smoke, buy your cigs at the duty free in your airport(don't have many brands in Mexico) and you will not have to buy there. Very cheap at duty free. Lots of vendors in the market yelling at you. Just ignore. Playamart by McDonalds had good prices on trinkets and prescription meds. Excursions. Selvetica ziplining was fun. The snorkeling was pretty good but not great. Our best meal was at a restaurant in Puerto Morelos where we caught a boat to snorkel. Awesome food and service. I bought the excursion in Playa thinking I'd save some money, but I paid 90.00 dollars instead of 95.00. Didn't save since I paid the taxi ten bucks. Don't waste your time. Buy online. Also, I used USA transfers from airport(private) and it was only 105.00 dollars round trip for three. Excellent service. Ask for Javier. He's the best. Get a private car for a few hours and he will take you to the best places. I wish I would have done this as I hired a taxi for akumal and yal ku for snorkelling and it was bad. Heard so much and was very disappointed. Apparently Javier knows places where the water is so clear. I saw his pictures. Give him a try. All in all, ok vacation but I've had better. Would not stay here again. By the way, I'm a wyndham resorts owner. Another warning. My friend fell on a whale, (sandbag) in front of another hotel, and she was on the beach for an hour. Neither hotel wanted to take responsibility for the mishap.It was an accident, but she broke her leg and was in a lot of pain and neither would call an ambulance. Luckily, there were doctors on beach as guests who helped, but please be aware. This is Mexico. They really don't want to help you.

When I think that the Maya was closed 6 weeks before and it wasn`t fully booked due to the swine flue we had a great time there. But I had some minor complains as well. They don\u00b4t offer the breakfast at poolside anymore. This was for me a great advantage 2 years ago, due to my girls and I are divers. When you get up early it was great to have a coffee and a small breakfast at the pool close to the diving center. This time we ha to go a long way to the restaurant to have breakfast. Not that fine than before. And I think many guests prefered that \"small\" breakfast at the pool instead of going to the restaurant. The Animation Crew tried to do their best also when showing the shows in the evening. But compared to the crew 2 years ago they were not that good even when Marcos and Marco are still there or again. This might be also because they were not at full strength at beginnig of vacation, but anyhow what we saw there 2 years ago cannot be topped. Sorry Emin!!

Overall impression: Value for money can't be beat! Maybe because of the H1N1 scare, I was able to book this hotel for just over $1000 which included the single supplement as I travelled alone. However, in the running as choices for my vacation in the same price range were Cayo Coco, Cuba & Punta Cana, D.R. but my thought process was the following. Cuba= off-season..thus food situation may be grim as I have been to 5 star in Cuba at the beginning of low-season and food availability drops thus less choice. Dominican= beaches not so nice. ROOMS: Well, here is what I figured out on this. There are 3 building blocks (1000, 2000, 3000). 1&2 buildings right down by beach on the lower part of the property near the main party pool, snack bar & theatre. Builing 3000 up near entrance, fitness centre, buffet restaurant & adult/quiet pool. Pros & cons of each: 1000/2000: PROS-right on beach, nice view, near all the action. CONS-Rundown, older, loud AC wall units, louder area. 3000: PROS-Newer, larger granite bathrooms with separate walk-in shower, jetted tub which is visable from bedroom., next to quiet pool. CONS: 4 minute walk to beach through resort, doors(locked) which connect to adjacent room thus sound travels easier. I stayed in room 3309...third floor overlooking the pool. Nice room..all tile, Look..we are new amenities...but lets be honest..we are in Mexico here..so although it is newer..finishing is not the greatest. Ex. Instead of wood trim around something..they caulk. I had a problem with the hot water my first day (which I later managed to figure out) so I had asked to be changed to diff building. When I heard the other buildings were older and run down I stayed. NOTE: when need hot water, turn on all hot taps and wait till hot water arrives..then do what you have to. FITNESS centre: Acceptable facilities...damn hot...sweat just standing there..great way to lose weight.lol Needs more cardio equipment. STAFF: Except for slow check-in during our arrival at 3 am, staff was great. I had complaint about someone peaking through crack of door from next room, they came right away and moved the wood door molding over to cover crack and nailed it in place to cover gap. NOTE: if you stay in building 3, because they have joining rooms, this is where the place groups & families. If you don't want adjoining rooms, ask for garden room view..this side does not have joining rooms BUT view not so nice. SCUBA centre: Great staff..great programs! I recommend trying the free Scuba lessons in the party pool in the afternoons. If you haven't done it....it is a great experience. I also recommend going out diving because the reefs are amazing as you border Cozumel. If you don't want to SCUBA dive, they offer snorkeling....for a great price. Go experience the aquatic life..incredible! Helpful staff..Frank, Licho, Emi, Israel, Ana.... Tell 'em James from Montreal, Canada recommended you visit them (might get you a bit of savings..) FOOD: Quality was good...a la carte restaurants were good..good service. No complaints. POOLS & BEACH: Quiet pool...I loved. Not crowded, bar not busy, no kids & loud music. Main pool, loud music, games, noise, kids. Beach..very nice, water amazing, clean. FINAL thoughts: Here are a few lessons I learned while there. Don't be intimidated to take a taxi anywhere..usually 50-70 pesos will do it (this is very safe). Go to Wal-mart for all your needs including cheap alcohol (by taxi), Go to Playa del carmen as soon as possible in your stay..you will realize how great it is (nightlife beats the pathetic on-site disco), visit CocoBongo one night to see a show, tip your room maid once at the beginning...you will always have water, cola, beer in your fridge (I gave $15 usd), experience Scuba or snorkeling once, don't be afraid to rent a car (in playa del carmen for the day and drive to Tulum ruins...short-safe trip which you do on your own schedule for less $, building 3000 is where you want to be, don't leave food/sweet drinks out over night in room...little tiny harmless bugs will find it...thus no food out..no bugs, be patient with slow internet, OH YEAH...on weekends, I was told they rent available rooms to locals...so it gets busy fri&sat..good time to practice spanish. If you have specific questions..message me & I will try answering them.

We stayed in rooms 1111 and 1113 which were extremely close to the pool. The bathroom in 1111 needed a serious upgrade and there are no dressers to store your clothes. I would recommend bringing your own linen if possible. I stayed in room 1111 and ended up with bug bites all over my legs (about 30 bites). Not sure if they were mosquito or bed bug bites. The hotel is very small with everthing in walking distance which worked out for us because it allowed the kids to wander without going too far. The bartenders are great!! Drinks were strong. The beach was beautiful. We didn't have much problem with getting chairs but I would recommend once you have one to keep your towel there all day. The evening shows were entertaining but a little corny. Be careful of the time share workers in the outside lobby of the hotel. Besides the bugs, that was the only real turnoff.

When we caught up to them we found that they had a nice room with a view of the ocean and our room was on the other end of the resort (as far from the ocean as you could get). We went back to the front desk and Viviana put us in a room right next to the ocean, two doors down from our family...it was perfect. Room was clean, bright, everything was in good working order. Like others have stated the A/C was a little loud but that actually helped us sleep better. The buffets were more than adequate although not airconditioned. There are areas in the restaurant that have good breezes from the gulf...find them before decide on a table. We ate at the Mexian restaurant and Portifinos...food was decent and there is A/C. We also ate at the traditional restaurant in the sister Azteca resort. Don't recommend it unless its cooler outside. It's outdoor and no breeze, with many mosqitoes. The bar staff was excellent, Antonio, Eder, and crew took very good care of us. Room cleaning staff was good as well. Beaches are pretty with lots of activity to keep you entertained. Also did the Tulum Extreme Adventure and had Alex as our guide and had a great time. If you do this bring bug repellant though.

I have been to Cancun many times but never to the Playa del Carmen area. We arrived around 12:30 in the afternoon and we were unable to get into our room before 3. We had lunch which was tasty. The buffet restaurant is unairconditioned and gets very hot but the food is good. We then went down by the ocean and pool to wait until we could get into the rooms. The pool and ocean were absolutely gorgeous with adequate palapas for shade. The bluest blue was the color of the ocean and there was plenty of white beach to enjoy. We did get our rooms around 3 p.m. and the rooms were fine - beds were a little hard but no trouble with sleeping in them. The two adult sisters stayed in one and the teenagers stayed in the other. Both were well airconditioned; ours had a beach/pool view and we were on the bottom floor. People had complained about the loudness of the airconditioners, but I found it fine and used it as \"white noise\" to sleep by. Every morning we were out to claim our chairs in the shade by 8:00 and there was no problem finding one. It did look as tho people put towels on chairs early and then didn't come back till the afternoon. The shady areas were the most popular areas for chairs being claimed early. The entertainment workers had fun throughout the day and got everyone who wanted to be involved doing water polo, funny pool games, bingo, dance lessons, archery, bouce ball, etc. There was always something to do. My sons learned to dance the meringue! The games did not seem to disturb anyone! The trapeze was fun for the boys; one of my sons was shown how to do more tricks as he mastered the first one quickly. I had a massage on the beach one day, paid about $50 for 50 minutes and it was wonderful. Hard to beat the sound of the surf when you are trying to relax! I would recommend it! They also have an indoor spa on the premises but I wanted to hear the surf! They also had an internet service that cost $2.50 for 30 minutes. Cheap and easy if you can't do without the internet for the week. We had good food throughout the week. The breakfast was good but it was often very repetitive but seemed to offer something for everyone. The dinners were excellent and we went to three nice restaurants (2 at the Maya: , 1 at the Azteca). We walked along the beach 3 hotels down to get to the sister hotel, the Azteca. Don't walk on the road - take the beach - it really is beautiful in the evening!!! We tipped the waiters at night and at breakfast. They make nothing much, and a few dollars from the gringos will help, I am sure! The lunch buffet at the pool area was OK, pizza was fantastic. Burgers were a little odd. You could make some nachos with cheese, chili and salsa and enjoy them! We loved the pool bar alot and Antonio was the greatest. He was there the entire 6 days we were there and we were always glad to see him. He got tips daily from us and appeared genuinely interested in making drinks we enjoyed. We also tipped our room cleaners! We had cute towel animals left on the beds and plenty of bottled water in the refridge. Blow a couple of dollars a day and help the Mexican workers! We booked Xcaret on line prior to going - www.xcaret.com and got a 10% discount. The staff in the hotel said they could have gotten us the same price, but who knows.? The problem with booking online was that we couldn't change the day we picked. Things come up where you might want to change it. You can always tell the person at the hotels that books trips that you saw \"10% off \" on the internet and they will give it to you. Xcaret is always fun! Just a word of advice - we went to the indoor/outdoor lazy river and snorkeled all the way around only to find out we were nowhere near where our shoes were.... big mistake as we had to walk on rocks back to civilization to get our shoes...... be careful if you are tender footed! We didn't go to Xcaret till about 1 p.m. - go earlier and see it all - we didn't get to see enough, I don't think. Things close around 6 p.m. and you then go see the evening extravanganza. We bought the higher priced Xcaret package that includes a buffet, lockers, snorkeling gear and I think it was worth it. We enjoyed it all - we all suffered a little Montezumas revenge during our trip and after but who knows if that is from the food, or from the tequila????? They bring in purified water to drink and you get bottled water in your refridgerator in your room - who knows where the upset stomachs came from. I always come prepared with Pepto Bismol and Immodium - and take it to any foreign country I go to. Beware of buying something in the gift shop - you give American money and they give you pesos. When you ask for American $$, they say they don't have it. There was alot of work going on at the hotel - lots of rooms under renovations- I bet the hotel wasn't even 50% occupied - so the economy is hitting them too. For the price and the amount of fun we had, we would certainly return here again. I have always enjoyed every hotel in the Cancun area that we have gone to - just getting out of town and relaxing is worth it's weight in gold! You get such a better deal for the money re: hotels/all inclusives down in the Cancun, Riveria Maya area that we should make it a point of going down there every year! Enjoy!!! Just a note, we bought liquor in the duty free shop in the Cancun airport - no problem taking it on the plane out of Mexico, however after going thru customs in the United States, you must pack it into your bags for the rest of your travels....... so make sure you have room for it in your bags!

The next day we had a lovely women at guest services- Elisa help us contact the US consolate-it took all of friday and some of monday to finally track someone down-she was lovely and we were sent on our way to collect a new passport! as for transportation from cancun airport to the resort-DO NOT ADD THE PACKAGE FOR PRIVATE VAN-its a ripoff and doesnt get you there in a luxiorious or speedy manor! as you EXIT the BAGGAGE claim walk out towards the front doors and find the small kiosk on your left-IN RED- for $5 per person you can take a chartered bus that leaves 3 times an hour- the ride takes you 1 hr/ and drops you off at the bus depot in playa. from there take a $5 taxi ride to the resort- its about 2 miles from the bus depot. upon thurs checkin we were greeted with champagne. there was no wait for check in and we were put in the front of the resort by the adult pool-in their new building. these rooms are HUGE! 2 queen beds, double sinks with full wall mirror, jaccuzzi style tubs with stone, fresh plush towels and a small balcony to sit out on at night. the housekeeping staff was amazing! each day we had a new \"towel animal\" the ladies were friendly and quick to let me into my room on the 2 occasions i locked myself out. the beach is out of this world- we walked and walked up and down each direction and the viva wyndham has the best beach front-they have amazing \"tree huts\" on the beach- BUT GET THERE EARLY- by 10 AM they are gone! the good thing is by 4 they clear out and you can usually find one. the pool has a swim up bar and plenty of chairs and tree huts to sit under. by 12:30 its usually packed with kids so if you want some real peach and quiet use the adult pool in the front of the property-it was virtually empty and there's a bar there. see JUAN for your drinks and tip the guys your first 2or 3 days- 20 pesos here and there goes a long day for employees who are there all the time! the food was mediocre at best. there are 3 resturants on site plus a buffet. the buffet is best for breakfast and lunch- go within the first hour of its opening as its the freshest. fresh break, chicken, omlets/eggs in the morning and veggies salads are the best-the churros-out of this world! Don diego is the mexican style resturant on site-its by far THE BEST-do not waste your time with the others- make dinner reservations on your first morning for the rest of your stay. many of the reviews i read mentioned rude and sketchy staff- we did not encounter any of this. each night there is entertainment down by the pool. we saw a maddonna show, moulin rouge and a few others. they were great! a little on the cheesy side but the staff puts on a wonderful show-their hard work shows! if you want a place that right on the beach and sits far away from the craziness of cancun-the viva maya is it. you could hardly tell there was 1000 people checked in for the weekend as we enjoyed much peace and quiet. i would definitly go back!", "Date": "July 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAwesome place!\u201d", "Author": "Secwepemc", "ReviewID": "UR35667983", "Content": "This resort is beautiful.

If you're thinking it may not be great because its star rating think again this place is worth every cent you pay. Our family went to this resort last Christmas. We thoughougly enjoyed it. The place was clean the staff friendly and there was a ton of stuff to do. There were activities every day/night on the beach. You wouldnt have to leave the resort if you didnt want to there's so much to do. The buffet(s) were really good, in the two weeks we were there we did not necessarily get tired of the food. Although the beach buffet was out of french fries(what the teenagers wanted) quite a bit if you waited a few minutes they restocked them as soon as they could. There is tons of selection and they have the occasional theme night. Sometimes you had to be inventive and poke around to find what you wanted but it was always there somewhere. The restaurants that you have to make reservations at were ok with the exception of the Mexican it was pretty good. We didnt like the reservation part and having to be there at a specified time so we only did it twice. The bars were plentiful and well stocked with pretty much anything you would want. Try the Mojitos with the fresh mint, well worth it. The resort brings in local crafters each week so you dont need to leave the resort to shop. However there is a market area just outside the gates and across the street that has great shopping as well. The beach was awesome, however when we went to this location we were unaware that there would be a number of topless bathers on the beach. A bit wierd for my teenagers especially my son. After a while it turned out to be quite hilarious as once he got used to it he was disgusted. All were not of teenager taste, mostly older, etc. The one thing I did not like about the beach was the smokers! Nasty! Oh and you have to get up really early if you want to get a good spot and chair on the beach. (6-7 am) grab your towel put it on your chair to secure your spot and come back at your leisure. Thats how its done and you get used to it. It was ok for us as my husband is an early riser. If you don't like beaches/oceans there are a couple of pools that are great as well. One thats out close to the beach and a adult pool thats way at the back. Our room was nice and close to the beach and the action but there are plenty that are not.

We got what we wanted - a great relaxing week full of smiles, food, drinks, relaxation, scuba diving, sun and fun. We got a great rate at Cheap Caribbean.com and went to enjoy the beautiful beaches near Playa del Carmen. Our group included two middle aged moms and three teenage boys - two fifteen year olds and one nineteen year old. This hotel is in Playacar- just about a $5 cab ride from Playa del Carmen. It is in a nice area near the Riu Playacar, Iberstar Royal Hideaway with shopping just across the street. It is about ten minutes to X-Caret park ($12 cab ride) and near everything. We enjoyed the week immensely. WE had two nice rooms in building one near the beach and the pool. We left the teenagers in one and the moms took the other. The air conditioning worked well and it was a blessing as July is hot and humid in Mexico. We slept well every night. The boys had a blast the whole week - there was always something to do - pool games, beach games, dancing lessons and our boys loved it. The social directors were friendly and encouraging and got participation from many people. They left you alone if you didn't want to play but encouraged all ages. The boys found the disco and the beach disco night entertaining (alot of girls) and stayed entertained until about 1 am. They were never bored. In fact, they wanted to stay longer and have asked to come back again soon. There is a trapeze at the resort that is open several hours a day for different age groups. The boys all have careers in the circus if nothing else pans out. It was very safe and something very different to offer! The instructors are very nice and helpful. There were many nationalities at the resort - many French Canadians, folks from Europe and many Americans. Many didn't speak English but it didn't matter, everyone found ways to communicate! That is what vacation is all about. Because we had booked six nights, we \"got\" three special restaurant visits and no more. I think you get two at the Maya and one at the Azteca if you ask that day. We ate at two wonderful Italian Restaurants - one at the Maya and one at the Azteca. We also experienced the Don Diego Mexican restaurant at the Maya. All the special restaurants were very good and nice and cool. The Azteca is a ten minute walk down the beach or out the front door from the Maya. The buffets at the Maya were good too. The breakfast buffet was very similiar every morning but had several made to order egg stations. I think they should vary breakfast foods and offerings more. Lunch and dinner buffets were excellent. The buffet is open air and can get quite warm. Look for the ceiling fans or the windows to catch a breeze. There is lunch served out by the pool each day. There are hotdogs, hamburgers, fresh pizza made right there as well as other meats and veggies and salads.. Food was always very fresh and good. One thing lacking was fresh quacamole daily. I only saw it a couple of times. YUMM - chips, quac and pica de gallo. My idea of Mexico! The bar service was excellent and friendly by the pool where we spent most of our time. Antonio worked the swim up bar and was so friendly and helpful. They have quite a selection of exotic drinks they offer. All the bar workers were nice and full of smiles. We offered small tips (brought plenty of $1 bills) and passed them around at dinners, bars, room attendants. The Mexican people work so hard, are so nice and often don't make much money. They really appreciated the tips. My son and I are scuba divers so we tried the dive shop next door at the Royal Hideaway. The Barrakuda. They were very professional and helpful and we had two great dives. I never visited the dive shop on property so I can't comment. The one problem I had was waiting two hours to get someone to come fix our battery on our door lock so we could get in. After about 20 keys and calling twice and marching up to the lobby twice, they came and we had no problems after that. I travel with my job and know what nice hotels are. This was a very enjoyable place to go with my family - everyone had plenty of rest, relaxation, good food and drink and the moms and boys were entertained. Don't expect five star in Mexico. Maybe I am too cheap to try to find one but this was a great place to spend a week for our boys and for the moms too.

Definitely conveniently situated. Plusses include an Avis car rental office right across the street, a great beach, and a dive center right on site. Playa Del Carmen (PDC) is a 15-minute walk away (or a $5/taxi cab ride, regardless of the number of passengers). The activities staff practiced their butts off to put on lengthly shows each night. Negatives: Not a big selection of food. If you like eating pizza and hot dogs every day then you'll like the food. By the 5th day it was getting a little old to me. Needless to say, they did have a Mexican food night one night that I really enjoyed. The front desk staff wasn't friendly at all, this in contrast to the waitstaff and activities staff. My 19-yo daughter described the disco as loud, throbbing, obnoxious euro trash music. My biggest complaint really isn't one about this hotel in particular but it needs to be said. They need to put up a sign that tells parents who have children under 12 yo that they need to supervise their children. There were too many parents who felt that they could just abandon their kids at the resort and let them get into whatever trouble they wanted to. One obnoxious boy interrupted a dart game that the activities staff was throwing, nearly getting himself stuck with a dart. The same brat got kicked out of the restaurant because he was trying to stick a knife into one of those rotating toasters--his parents no where in sight in either instance. Some single mother from western Canada would leave her 6 yo daughter alone all day and well into the evening while she went out scuba diving, taking tours, etc. Even when she was at the resort, she would be busy stuffing her face, surfing on the Internet, or having a good time with people and didn't have a clue what her daughter was getting into. This happened day after day after day. If it wasn't for certain tourists at the hotel who felt someone needed to look after this girl, I don't know what might have happened to her. I don't know what kind of parent could enjoy herself and not care what was happening to her daughter. The girl was a pest and one time almost got hurt because she barged into the middle of a water polo game, but she didn't know any better. ith a mother like this, how could she? Tips: If 2 or more people want to take a side trip to Chichen Itza it's more economical to rent a car than to pay $99 pp for the tour. Make sure you exchange money in PDC if you're planning on taking the ferry to Cozumel. The women in the ticket office for the ferry are really nasty and only give you an exchange rate of 10:1 while the bank gives (as of this writing) 14:1. Be prepared to have tour guides try to sell you something practically every step you take in PDC.

Viva Maya served its purpose well!! I went with my family (mom/dad/twenty-something sisters) and our family from landlocked Colorado (auntie/Uncle/two under 15 boys) and My Auntie who arrived alone, and I have to say there was something for everyone! While the adults never tired of the free drinks, the boys made fast friends with foreigners and the activites provided by Viva are endless. I didn't get a chance to do everything I wanted to in my 8 days. The resort is located closer to the excursion sites than Cancun (a plus) and though we rented cars, there are plenty of options to get around easily. We enjoyed our day trips to Coba and Tulum, but you don't really ever have to leave the resort if you don't want to. There is sailing and scuba and beach activities everyday on-site, plus spanish and dancing lessons, bocci, etc. I was beyond impressed with the staff, you can tell they work incredibly hard but make it look like SO MUCH FUN (and I know it is.....alllll inclusive, right guys?) They have to be constantly exhausted but their attitudes were outstanding. Our whole family really took to a couple of them and it made the trip more personal. I was stoked on the \"Aqua Gym\" (water aerobics) everyday, and my cousins were into the trapeze. They had nightly \"shows\" that were totally cheeseball but I grew to love them and it was something entertaining after a long day of drinking, and a big dinner. Did I mention the flow of booze?? I especially appreciated that there wasn't an up-charge for more-quality alcohols, I can't count how many shots of Hornitos I had. And Dos XX on tap was like water! All the bartenders were super friendly and accomodating to the drunks, and that's gotta be a hard job! The Disco on site was a little cheeseball but it was still fun and SUPER airconditoned which I liked, of course. There were also excursions to town to go clubbing which was WAY FUN, and a more safe and secure way to hit the town as a young lady from the California. Plus there are more taxis than people so you can always get home when you realize how late it is and how drunk you are. Okay so there were a few downsides. I try to be of the notion that everything has it's downfalls, so my concern is only for others who are curious. One: The restaurants sat empty and it was nearly impossible to get a resi. What gives?? When we did get in, we were told that our party of 9 had to be split up, and upon our arrival there was nobody else even in there. WTF??? The attitude of the host was snobby and negative, the only negative energy I felt form anyone. Our server the first night seemed very aghast with our table, and when I requested to change my order (as he still was at the table taking it) he rolled is eyes at me, and sighed heavily. Uhhhhh, sorry??? That was totally out of line. I'm in the service industry and I know how it is, but it was an instant turn off. Two: The toilet in our room was broken most of the time. I wasn't too concerned because I had an adjoined room with my family, and by the end I was sick of calling maintence to fix it. But definitely not a good thing. Three: We had a room on the very end of the building, right on the sand, and one night I took a swim for not even 10 minutes, and having left my slider open, someone came in and stole mine and my sister's digital cameras. Nothing else was gone and luckily our safe was locked, but that was total bull, and I know there had to be someone watching me, which wasn't settling at all to say the least. So, yes, it is necessary to lock up your stuff and your room completely. I'm aware that letting your gaurd down is never a good thing and I do blame myself for the careless moment, but it still made me quite angry and I hope whoever took those P.O.S.'s liked all our drunken bathroom photoshoots :( All in all it was a great vacation, and aside from having the bellman chase me with a pair of scissors to cut my wristband after check-out, I would say it was damn well near perfect!", "Date": "July 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delft", "Title": "\u201cGreat fun !

Besides noisy a/c, defective electronic safe and ironing board with mold, we've had great room service for the rest of the time being. Some restaurants were closed during the whole staying. Only the italian (15mins walk north to Viva Wyndham Azteca) and the Mexican restaurant were available for booking within restricted hours, used to be 8-3pm that was changed to 8-1pm. You have to plan ahead of time if you want to experience the limited restaurants. Food: I was VERY pleased with the food quality and variety at the buffet, I saw a manager monitoring the food temperature with a laser device at the buffet, they appear to take food safety on the serious side. I usually get fed up after a few days eating in resort buffets, but this is not the case here, every meal was a positive experience! The Mexican restaurant was a better experience than the Italian restaurant for both of us. All the animation staff was fun, the night shows were very entertaining. The staff made you feel important except for this young boy sollicitating guests for jogging session who was surprisingly unpleasant and appeared to lack motivation with his job. Scuba diving courses, beware! I've paid ahead for reservation for an introduction course and one dive at sea. The next day, they almost took me to the boat without the intro course in the swimming pool, since the two other participants were previously qualified, they have shortened my course to save time, no video shown, etc. and gave me a t-shirt for not obtaining the whole training, they said there was \"a misunderstanding\". Beach scam: don't buy the silver jewelry from the beach at the resort! the seller claims it's .925 pure silver with the stamp on it, a magnet sticking to it will confirm it is NOT silver. It's ok to sell fake when you say it IS. You are better off paying a little extra for the real thing at an established jewelry store.

I've saved more than half price buying similar package in an office near the ferry in Playa Del Carmen for a trip to the Coba Maya ruins, cenote and Mayan family visit. gr8 experience! Don't waste your money for the snorkeling in Cozumel, a LOT of the coral is gone because of hurricane wilma 2005, surprisingly, they charge you an extra $2 tax / person for the preservation park which we learned later on that we were apparently not taken to! so guess which pocket the tax money went. :-( In conclusion, for us, the whole trip was a best bang for the buck.", "Date": "July 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth", "Title": "\u201cWorst Mexico Hotel Experience Ever!\u201d", "Author": "plestig", "ReviewID": "UR33569122", "Content": "We stayed here for 1 week with 5 adults & 2 children.

I had read many reviews that stated the rooms were not up to par and that the food was average at best so my expectations were somewhat low. The rooms were a little dark and the air conditioning wasn't exactly silent but none of this really bothered us. The beach was beautiful and we never had a problem finding seats under the shade. I would say we were out at the beach by 9 am the latest and the beach was still relatively empty at that time. There are big sandbags on the beach and in the water and while they are somewhat of an eyesore we still found the beach to be just as beautiful sandbags and all. The pool was nice but there seemed to be a lot of children there during our stay so we chose to keep our distance from the noise. The drinks and bartenders were good. You have to ask for name brand liquor but they do have it. We tipped the bartenders for our first few rounds of drinks on our first day and never waiting for a drink the rest of our stay. As for the rest of the staff, they do a great job trying to get people involved. If you are there with children this might be nice. They also have shows at night. We only watched one which seemed to be geared more towards children but it was still entertaining to watch. I will admit that by the end of our stay the food at the buffets did get a little old. From reading reviews I was prepared for that so I wasn't as disappointed. You have to make reservations for the restaurants between 8am and either 1 or 2pm. I recommend making them right when you get there. We have stayed at all inclusives where you have to pay extra to eat at the restaurants but they are included in the all inclusive package at this resort. We ate that the Mexican restaurant Don Diego (I think it was called) and the Italian restaurant at the Viva Wyndham Azteca. I had a terrible steak at the italian place but had a great meal at the mexican restaurant. My fiance loved the italian restaurant and didn't enjoy his food at the mexican restaurant. It's hit or miss depending on what you order I guess. I go on vacation for the beach, the views and to relax. This resort is perfect for that.

We were given 2 adjacent rooms, which was our request, and they were located by the adult pool at the back of the resort. We found the rooms lovely, spacious, quiet, clean and nicely decorated.

We had to wait 4 hours for Orbitz to fax a confirmation, which they did REPEATEDLY. Even though the people working the front desk (including the manager) was aware there had been a mistake, they refused to check us in. We waited for 4 HOURS without being offered so much as a drink\u2014something they offered everyone checking in, but us. Then, after 4 hours had past they finally gave us a room, which was in an entirely different building from the one our friends (who booked the same room, same time also through Orbitz) were staying in. The front desk said there was nothing they could do about that. If we wanted to switch rooms we'd have to check back in the morning at 9. At 9 we went to the font desk and discovered were told (by the person we'd been stuck with for most of the 4 hours the previous night) that there she didn't have any kind of record that we wanted to switch rooms. We'd have to come back at 9:30 and talk to the manager. So, we did that, and the manager informed us that rooms wouldn't be available until 12. We checked back and 12 and were told to wait until 1. At that point I'd had it. I blew up at the manager and told him I was sick of this. I DEMANDED that he swear on his mother's grave that we would have a room at 1. He did. And we did. But we were out one whole day of our vacation by the time we'd moved our bags and switched rooms. Did we get anything for our trouble? NOT ONE THING. Our fridge in the \"all-inclusive\" resort was empty. When we asked for drinks for it we were told to go to the bar, they didn't put drinks in people's rooms.

At this point we couldn't imagine cancelling (our bags were already packed...it would be too depressing to unpack them) so we went. We were so glad that we went. The hotel was great, the staff were wonderful and the weather and surroundings were a lush, tropical beauty. We booked the trip thru Sunwing and flew Sunwing Airlines...they were very good especially our Sunwing rep Martin at the hotel. We booked and ate at all the ala carte restaurants and liked them all very much. The buffet was great esp. breakfasts: omelet\u2019s, made to order eggs, French toast, OJ and fruit were all fabulous. and tons of variety of meats and breads and side dishes. The snack bar by the beach was a favourite for us at lunch; great pizza, pastas, nachos, bean and rice dishes and salads were especially favoured by my family. The staff at the bars, the maids and all of the other staff were all friendly, helpful and given the additional stress they were under about being laid off work due to the health scare; they still always acted as though the guests at the hotel were their only concern. We tried to tip especially well given that we knew they may be out of work for a while after we left. Excursions: We did a 1/2 day snorkeling trip called \"Morning Glory\u201d which we booked at the front desk. It was wonderful. We were picked up at 7:30am and taken by bus to a National Park where there was massive coral reef and taken by guides (in the water) to two areas were we saw fantastic tropical fish and the kids even saw a sting ray. It was $62 US each but well worth it for the experience. It was windy the day we went so lots of waves. They don't tell you this but you need to be a pretty strong swimmer to do this excursion as you are swimming in water that you cannot touch bottom for a good two hours. You need biodegradable sunscreen (as the other stuff damages the coral reef) Also we brought our own masks and mouth pieces but used their flippers and life jackets. They supply all the equipment if you need it though. We had booked a tour to Tulum to see the ruins but unfortunately all of the National Institutions were closed due to the health concerns and so we got a refund. We went to El Alux in Playa del Carmen for dinner on our last night. It was a cave bar /restaurant which I had read great reviews in Trip advisor and it was a true highlight of our trip. If they offer a tour after dinner...take it. The tour guide works on tips. We gave him 100 pesos. Really worth going to see. Our kids went parasailing off the beach beside the hotel. They loved it!!! It was a bit pricey at $60us each but they thoroughly enjoyed it. Coming home Coming home we were screened at the Mexican Airport in Cancun for illness (temp check, filled in questionnaire and met with a doctor for a minute.) We were all well and two weeks later we are all still well. The H1N1 was never really an issue while were there but apparently the news media went nutso and blew it all out of proportion. When we got back many people in Canada reacted weirdly to us when we told them we were in Mexico (mostly because they saw our tans and asked where we had been) The health issue was not a health issue were we were and we really tried to not get caught up in the media's hysteria. It also helped that we stayed away from the TV and internet while we were there. There was no point it getting worked up...we were already there...we might as well enjoy it.

If I would have had to stay in the old and bug infested room for the whole 14 days my review would be quite so neutral!

Try the jungle tour even my 7 yr old was out kayaking it was amazing! I would also recommend xcaret to swim with the dolphins its a bit more expensive but you will enjoy it more but listen to others when they say you need more then just a day. all in all I would say we had a pleasent vacation at the Maya however, 2 days before we went home, we were heading out in the a.m for a tour and my Father forgot something in his room upon returning to the lobby quite upset it came up that when he went to the room he found the security guard wondering around in it!! he didn't say anything just slipped out the patio door, and I have to say knowing that the hotel manager will read this that he was the most pathetic of them all, he acted as if it wasn't that big of a deal and he would try and look into it...well we have never heard anything more about it and I'm sure we won't but do make sure you lock up your belongings because there are plenty of thieves around!!! I also had cloths taken and my mother \"lost\" a bracelet...I don't mean to scare anyone I never felt unsafe not once until of coarse that happened but just be aware it happens.

Front desk - Upon arrival, we didn't receive the best service, but it was limited to one worker.. the rest of the week we had a great response. We had a problem with our first rooms air conditioner leaking and the door not latching properly everytime, and they moved us to an ocean view no questions asked. Cleaning staff - All around the resort you see the workers going with the big bins of bedding to be washed or the gardeners working on the lawns, but no matter who you passed they All said hello to you. There were times that we would be walking and just here ola out of the blue. We truly felt like we were welcomed there, not like we were a bother or in their way like we had in previous years. Overall - We have stayed at 5+ star Riu's in the past, and enjoyed ourself very much, but even though this one is a 4 star resort, we felt like we were receiving 6 star treatment. We will return here for sure.", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nova Scotia", "Title": "\u201cWe lovet it and recommend it\u201d", "Author": "MPFR", "ReviewID": "UR29380621", "Content": "The service at the resort was excellent. As soon as we got off the bus, Jesus, the bellboy was ready to help and he was available at any time for help. Also the check in process was easy and quite fast. We did not like our original room because the bathtub had a rather crude repair job done on the bottom with some type of silicone that looked odd. No problem, we changed to another room in the new building, the bellboy, Jesus, did all the lifting and we just followed along. The location in Playa car was excellent with the little shops accross the street. We went on bicycles around Playacar a few times and felt safe. As noted in other reviews, you can walk to town in 1/2hr or so. We found the food to be fine. Not sure how people rate this as bad? Based on the resort rating? Anyway, the buffet was good with what we felt to be a good variety for plain food or more spicy etc. The deserts were rather plain, but in our experience travelling they almost always are. The a la cartes were somewhat better as is usual in these resorts (in our experience). We found the Italian over at the Azteca to be the best of all. The beach is one of the best on that strip and the large sandbags are a non-issue, in fact they probably help reduce undertow. You do need to get your spot quite early, 6am or so, or you will not get any shade. We found the area safe although we had an issue that I will talk about below. Beach vendors...we were stupid and bought some \"silver chains\" on the beach. A few days later when we were in town a rather friendly and informative shop vendor pointed my chain out as fake and went on to show us the fake markings compared to real. That was our fault. The chain turned green between the links in a few days! There was even an article in the paper warning us...we just read it too late! Trampoline. We didn't go on it, but if we were a little younger, and maybe lighter, it looks like it would be fun and the kids were having a blast. Pool...we don't go in pools at any resorts....they seem more like washrooms for many of the pool bar attendees...just our oppinion. The grounds were lovely with staff raking, pruning trees and doing general yard stuff all the time. VERY UNFORTUNATE......We were at the resort for two weeks. The first week was prior to the H1N1 and then the \"so called\" pandemic stir started. I guess time will tell and we are not medical experts, but we felt that the steps and actions taken by other coutries were rather severe. This is a truly beautifull and historical part of the world that relies 100% on tourism. By shutting down tourism, we are going to starve these people. It was obvious on the last few days that things were changing from paradise to something else. The beach vendors were getting more pushy, the staff were getting more on edge etc. No fault of their's, they are going to be without work! On our second last day, we had our beachbag stolen off our chair while unattended, most likely someone passing by grabbed it. This was a good little wakeup call that things are about to take a turn down there. This resort was shutting down on May 4 or 5 and any guests were to be moved to the Azteca up the street which is also nice. Most of the employees we spoke with were told they were getting one month off. Some were fine, but others were doing their best to hide concern and rightfully so. We would absolutely return to this resort without a thought. Our heartfelt concern goes out to the staff of this resort and the whole area for what could be a devastating blow to the economy and personal hardships that may result.", "Date": "May 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canton, MI", "Title": "\u201cFabulous stay, fabulous staff & fabulous beach\u201d", "Author": "Time4T", "ReviewID": "UR29347076", "Content": "My \"new\" husband and I got married here on Apr. 27th.

I am so thankful that we did! First of all, to those who complained about the buffet food, all I can say is \"What is wrong with you?\" We ate at the Terrace buffet every morning for breakfast and four nights for dinner. Just to name a few that we enjoyed: hand-carved prime rib, suckling pig, any type of eggs you requested, pancakes, made-to-order omelets (and the bacon was never \"hidden behind the counter\" - there was a ton of it every morning!) and home-made donuts for breakfast. The dessert tables were abundant, ice cream almost every evening, a huge variety of pastries for breakfast, lots of seafood selections at dinner (octopus, shrimp, salmon, the biggest mussels I've ever seen, and other types of grilled fish), fresh fruit (melons, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, etc.), a full salad bar, other grilled meats (chicken, hamburgers, etc.) a wide variety of beverages (soda, juices, iced tea, etc.), pre-made salads, and a variety of mexican dishes every night. They had a chocolate fountain with fruit and marshmellows one night and it was the best chocolate we've every tasted! We never left the buffet unsatisfied and the girls tried new foods they've never had before. The used dishes were whisked away as soon as you finished and your coffee cup was refilled immediately. The beach was absolutely beautiful and I can still feel my feel buried in the warm, soft sand. It was windy the week we were there, so our plans to scuba dive had to be cancelled, but we really enjoyed swimming in the huge waves. We spend alot of time at the pool and the girls participated in lots of new activities with the entertainment crew (darts, bocci ball, aqua-arobics, salsa lessons, etc.) The shows were fun (most of the crew really could dance well) - the girls loved \"Melissa from Canada\" the best - she was very nice during daytime activities and was very talented during the shows - loved her Chicago number and Marilyn Monroe! The staff was always friendly and when we checked in and realized our bathroom door was jammed and would not close enough to lock, it was fixed within a half hour. We had a ground level room with a patio, right next to the beach. It was perfect because it was located right at the beach near the main pool and bar and the girls could come and go through the sliding door. My husband and I sat on the patio with fresh coffee from the pool bar (or cappucino) every morning with a cool breeze blowing off the water and it was pure heaven! Our recommendation would be to take lots of sunscreen and re-apply it every two hours! We did not re-apply enough and all got extemely sunburned the second day. We had to spend the rest of the week covered with T-shirts, which gave the girls crazy tan marks for their Senior Prom! The only complaint we have about the resort is that one of our girls left $50 in her suitcase (my husband put his wallet in the room safe - it was very easy to use!) and it was stolen during a cleaning session, and our other daughter had an article of clothing stolen at the same time (an undergarment - that was disturbing!) Another disappoint ment (although not anything to do with the hotel), was that the girls each spend $25.00 for Henna tatoos at the plaza across the street from the hotel. Even though they were told the tatoos would last for two weeks, they began to peel the very next afternoon - as we waited in the airport on our way home! By the time we got home, they were pretty much gone! I was upset that the girls were scammed, so if you see the Henna tatoo booth, save your money! To sum this up, we had a blast and recommend this hotel to everyone. I have a vacation album full of beautiful pictures of the girls and our family on the beach and at the pool and participating in the various activities.

I too read the reviews and was a little nervous about my choice. Let me say that I had a wonderful time! I was very happy to have such wonderful weather. Do not trust weather.com!! When we arrived we were greeted with a glass of juice and met instantly with a rep. to check in. The bellboy was very helpful and gave us a mini tour of the resort. This was the start of the very helpful staff we encountered all vacation! Our room was on the first floor overlooking the ocean! Very beautiful! The room was small but very clean. Honestly, who spends a lot of time in their room on vacation!?! Our strip of beach was great! The location of the sand bags did not impact swimming at all (unlike other resorts). THERE ARE CHAIRS EVEN AFTER 6 am. Many if not all of the huts are claimed though. I left my beach bag on my chair and it was safe each time I left. I would recommend getting to the beach a little early if you would like a \"prime\" spot. There are people walking the beach trying to sell para sailing and jewelry. They are very friendly though! A simple \"no\" works just fine. At 10 am every day staff comes out trying to get you to join in on activities. They are all very friendly but it can get a little annoying when all you want to do is relax on the beach. I did given in and played bocce ball. It was a great time with a international crowd! Breakfast was great every morning. The staff was very attentive filling up coffee and removing plates. Fresh fruit, eggs, pastry, bacon, etc. were all very good. Sausage had a different sort of spice in it. Lunch and dinner buffets were O.K. Honestly, that would be my only MINOR complaint of the resort. There are many choices and you can always find something you will like. Desserts were great. Fried ice cream, crepes, and other cakes were a great ending to each meal. I would wait to eat either at 6:30 or after 8:30 at the buffet. Was very busy during the 7:30-8:30 time. I recommend booking restaurants for the week the day you arrive or ASAP. You can do that from 8am-2pm. The line can get long to do this. I HIGHLY recommend the Italian restaurant that over looks the beach. Wonderful food and great service as usual. We went over to the Azteca (sister hotel) to eat as well. That hotel is beautiful too. A little quieter. About a 10 minute walk to get to. Snack bar had great pizza. The rest of the food there was ok. Did hold you over until dinner. The bar by the lobby is much better than the pool bar (pool bar does have longer lines). Coffee bar was great. Loved the lattes. There is a great shopping plaza across the street. However, if you want better deals i suggest you take a taxi down to 5th avenue. We also went to Chichen Itza and swam in a cinote. I highly recommend booking through the hotel (x41) and using Cancun Line. Our tour guide Beto was incredible! Maybe have paid a little extra but worth the service and information given. We also took the ferry to Cozumel. Be cautious when buying jewelry. I was sold a pair of earrings that were sterling silver not white gold like I was told. Luckily, I ran into a tourist police that was helped me get my money back! It was a nice looking store was further down the strip near where the cruise ships dock. Internet is available for $2 for 30minutes at the hotel. There was always at least one computer available to use. I did catch a few of the shows. They were entertaining and very loud. Staff puts in a lot of hard work. Overall, I would recommend the Viva Wyndham Maya.

Omelet station very good. I ate the best shepherd's pie I've had in my life at the buffet, surprisingly enough! Did not dine at the a la carte restaurants. I ate those greasy nachos and cheese every day, I couldn't get enough! - We were upgraded to an ocean-view room after 2 nights after I advised the front desk that I had a Wyndham membership. Room was large and view gorgeous. The A/C was a bit loud but I go for the warm weather anyway! - Walked to Playa del Carmen a few times, about a 30min walk each way. Took a taxi back one night because we were tired and it was $5.00 one-way. Even on the way back with the taxi, we had to stop at some kind of security check-point where the guards checked the taxi and asked us which hotel we were going. This really made me feel comfortable and felt secure about being in the taxi. Don't buy anything where the ferry docks from Cozumel, everything is super over-priced!! - the little market place just down the street where the Starbucks is and vendors, there's a vendor by the name of Angel (pronounced An-hel) with Rainbow Tours.

This was never more true than this trip for our one year anniversary. My wife is great and is pretty easy to please and I can be a bit of a travel snob. We usually go to Coz in the summer and her company in the past has done Playa and I have done Cancun almost twice a year myself before we were married. We are familiar with the area and what is offered accomadtion wise so we are not newbies to the area but we had never been to Playa together. I know a long intro but this will put my review in perspective. I take the time up front to do my research so I am totally aware of what I am getting into. Most of the time after reading on here, which to me is the best tool around for travel, you can really have some alarm if you read long enough. Like wise you also get the good so it works both ways. One thing I noticed on the reviews was that the managment team at the Viva almost always addressed any negative reviews and alot of positive. That is always a good sign as this has never let me down. When the staff cares enough to actually find out what the guest gripes and praises are then they actually care. It always will over shadow any short comings or issues that a hotel or location might present. A brand new state of the art place with all the bells and whistles does not need this kind of managment view as they have it all. But in todays competitive market with travelers pocket books tight and the resort competition fierce not everyone can shell out the needed cash to stay at the brand new joint that is all the rave in the media or internet. We are not broke I just would rather spend money other places on my trip than on a room that I might only see when I sleep and shower. That all out of the way I chose this resort based on first any negatives I read about seemed to be addressed by the staff, plus the price made sense for us overall and the beach which is what the wife wanted most was good. I read the reviews as well and it seemed like this place was just perfect and alot of good reviews were on here. I still had my concerns as I read some negative stuff on here and it was pretty negative. It was down the list on the rankings overall. In the back of my mind I was concerned and not to mention all the media scare of safety in Mexico. For the current situation flu wise I can offer only this we both came back again just fine but it was March. As for the other all I will say is that we felt safe our entire time and while we saw a road block on our way back to the airport that was really it. I have seen police with guns in tote down there since college in the 80's and that is no big deal. And for the road check point I felt that showed that the work was being done to prevent any more problems down there. We have never had issues and for this trip we left the resort everyday or night and we had not worries at all. Back to the resort! I was worried the days leading up to our trip but I trusted my instincts and the staff just seemed to care so I off we went. We arrived as expected around 5pm and was surprised to see only one person working at the desk. I waited a few minutes and then realized that I had joined the Wyndam rewards program and got to go to the other line with only 1 person in it for memebers. So the wait to check in was partially my fault but was about 15 mins total. We got to our room and got set up only to find our screen door had come off the hinge and was stuck. Ahhh I was starting to get that sinking feeling but we called down to the desk to report it and headed to the buffet for dinner. We came back to our room and it was fixed and never gave us any more issues. We had a room on the third floor overlooking the pool and beach area very close to the water. It was nice for the view and at the end of our hall was a public balcony with chairs that offered even a better view and photo ops for us. We had one key that did not work and I had left the other in the room so we had to treck back day #1 to get another but they never gave us any more issues there. Yes, a pain but that has happened in my favortite hotel in Las Vegas or Chicago so nothing to ruin our stay. I needed the work out anyway! Room wise these things are not huge but they work. Bright colors, your average bathroom that was clean and everything worked. My wife and I had room to manuever in the bathroom so it seemed good to us. We had enough closet space and they had a area above the closet area that could store extras or put the suit cases out of the way. Everything was in fine working order and the beds a bit hard but that is not uncommon in resorts in Mexico. We liked our balcony and we were close enough to the pool bar to grad a beer or two for our room as we got ready to go out at night. Our room was fine and I found the maids fast and effecient everyday. Standard solid room a while not brand new it was just fine make that perfect for us! Ours on the top floor had a semi vaulted ceiling so it gave it a different feel than just a standard cut out resort room. Food wise we ate breakfast everyday and that was my favorite! Plenty of choices and loved the omelette station! Also fresh fried donut station! Service was great and staff was friendly always giving a hello or hola. Overall your standard buffet choices and with all you have your hits and misses. It is for the masses and it will be like that from time to time. Lunch again was solid and had plenty of choices. Overall the food was just fine. We ate dinner only on night #1 and it was fine with a great fried ice cream station! We only ate dinner once not because of the resort but us. We like to get out and in a place like Playa you got to get out! 5th avenue is awesome kind of an old world feel, maybe a Bourbon street feel? with a bit of Vegas glitz and with so many choices it is insane! It is not seedy at all and has something for everyone! I really knew I was not at home and was someplace special and unique. Dinning in Playa and around 5th was a big highlight for us. The night life following is also great! The Viva is a great location in the private Playacar area and a short 5$ cab ride each way to the action of downtown Playa. I could do a whole review and our dinning and bar choices but let me say that our choices were great all around and a heck of a bang for our buck. We found one place thanks to our bartender who was eager to help us with our evening plans. He saw us every night as we warmed up for the night out dinning and drinking and knew what we were looking for and he helped with great advice! I still have places left on my list for our next trip that I never got to! We liked the pool area and the snack/buffet is perfect for a quick bite while soaking up the sun. A beer and a good hotdog or cheese burger and back to snooze by the pool. The pool bar is busy and a good social scene during the day. One thing about Mexico it is a United Nations place with people from Boston, Quebec, UK and Germany. I heard french. portugues, german and Texan all spoken and all spoke english together. It is fun to small talk with someone from another place while you are in paradise. I love the swim up bar concept and next to swim up blackjack in Vegas is the best swim up you can ever do. Most resorts have swim up bars and the Viva has a good one which seemed to attract the real social types. My wife relaxed while I mixed it up with the great staff at the bar and the guests that were from Iowa, Boston and all over! It was a daily happy hour that kind of evolves on it own. My only pool area and beach problem is the chair issue. There are plenty of chairs at the pool and beach but they seem to get a towel on them to reserve them while there are actually no fannies sitting in them. Once we found ours we usally moved around as better locations opened up as the rude sqawtters returned to move their stuff and dissappear to their rooms or wherever. This is a problem at many resorts and not just here but it still is a pain. We do not get up at 5am to place our towels out then return until we are ready. To me that is just ridiculous! There is no way around it so you have to fight the sqawtters so be aware. Either race out there early or be patient and have yourself ready to move to a better spot when it becomes available. Maybe resorts could have a beach/pool maitre de that could organize this problem. This negative does not ruin the pool or beach which were great. The sand whales are there and all over the area up and down the coast but the beach at the Viva was great. Plenty of sand, sun, and surf and the water cold but a relief! Again, loved the pool and the swim up bar. Extra things of note: The grounds are beautiful and some native wild life to look for as well. One creature I am still not sure what it was but it was cool to see. We saw the activity staff hard at work with games and dance lessons but we did not join in. It looked fun and the staff was fun but we were only moving for beer and into the pool! The night club seemed like it was fun from what we heard but we never made it there as we spent to evenings on 5th ave. The other guest we met said that they liked it. The front bar is great and the staff up there could not have been better! These guys deserve your tips not to mention the guys at the pool bar! Tip Tip Tip!! Also, left our maids a dollar or two and our room was perfect! Overall this staff does care and does all it can to make up for the fact that they are not brand new. Do not let that trendy spot charging 200 bucks more a day stear you wrong and waste your money. You can save some and get a great resort with a staff that cares and have some money left over to take in the area attractions that interest you. After all my worries my belief that the staff cared was backed up by our stay and when the staff takes the time to read these posts and reviews and respond and act on the issues you will not go wrong. I am glad I trusted my instincts and so is my wallet!

I never had a problem finding a chair; they had in abundance. There were employees that would come around every so often to pick up empty cups and plates so that the beach area was sanitary. In my one week of vacation, I witnessed 3 weddings! It was beautiful. The hotel was spacious with many sitting areas and places to take a little promenade and admire the sights around you. I saw some animals that I've never seen before. The flowers were beautiful; really something nice to look at. If you like vegetation, you will like this resort. As for the food, it was very enjoyable. Not quite top of the notch. The fish was excellent, as well as the pasta. Often I had to check if the meat was cooked well enough; often it was not. All in all there was a lot of variety, certainly enough for all kinds of different tastes. The service was extremely good as well. My favourite part of Viva Wyndham would have to be the staff. Everyone was so friendly and willing to be of help. I particularly liked the animators. They get very involved with the guests and they are all easy to get along with. There are plenty of activities and games organized for people of all ages. The animators often came on the beach to yell out what game they were going to play or what dance lesson they were going to give for all to hear and join in. They even came with trays of fruits on the beach to offer to the guests. As for the evening entertainment; most of the shows were fun to watch. There was one show I did not enjoy at all. I though it was exceedingly sexual. I actually got up to leave. It made me a little angry that they would put on a show like that when there were so many children watching. So this is for the resort itself. As for my room, it's a completely different story. I'll begin with the bathroom. The bathtub had a little spot with old toothpaste in it. The drain did not work too well, so by the end of my shower I was standing a foot deep in water. Now for the room. My first impression when I walked in was old and rusty. I was disappointed that there was no radio. My safe did not work. When I hit the light switch the lights twitched so I didn't know if they would just burn out in any given moment. The worst part of the room, however, was the bed. It had a concrete base. It was stiff as a board, just like my neck the next morning. Sometimes the person who cleaned the room didn't leave towels so I would have to call the front desk and have some sent over. The biggest hassle was to get into my room. Not just I but many people on my floor has problems. My card stopped working on the second day, and starting from then it took forever to get into my room. Throughout the week I visited the front desk multiple times to have my card \"re-charged\" which didn't help the matter. Finally someone came to change the battery. It helped, but I still had problems getting into my room afterwards. On my last night, I left an empty glass on the desk in my room, and when I came back after the show, it was covered with ants. I don't know where they came from because I checked my patio door and it was shut and locked tight! At least the air-conditioning was working well. So if you can manage to get yourself in the newer rooms, your stay will be much more enjoyable, I am certain. Although my room was the way it was, I eventually got used to it, and it would not prevent me from going back to this resort.", "Date": "April 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Quebec", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation!\u201d", "Author": "JoecatMontreal", "ReviewID": "UR28293542", "Content": "My boyfriend and I just got back from the Viva Wyndham Maya and loved it.

Normally my husband and I like a low key hotel when we are on our own but knowing this resort caters to the younger crowd and after reading all the reviews we knew what to expect. Here's the low-down of our enjoyable vacation at the Viva Wyndham Maya. Travel - We travelled for the first time via Sunwing out of Halifax NS. We were pleasantly surprised with its service both inflight and transfer to resort despite their \"no frills\" service. No delays going down and only an hour delay upon return. Flight attendants were friendly also and food edible. Transfer to hotel was excellent. A large van took 8 of us directly to our resort as soon as we picked up our luggage. The only mishap to report was when my son left his backpack on the van. We realized later and tracked down the driver. We were relieved to see he had held it aside but was disappointed to find my son's meager $8 was missing from his bag but everything else was still there. Of course, it was our fault for forgetting it in the first place but reinforces the fact that you should never leave your personal items unattended. Check in was a breeze. Rooms - We stayed in room 2366. Our room was large and comfortable enough and so was the bathroom - maids also do a great job of keeping them clean. However, I have to agree with other posters that dressers would be really nice instead of living out of your suitcase and the air conditioner sounded like diesel engine running all night. In fact, we had to turn it off a few nights just to get a break from the noise. I can normally tollerate a running air conditioner but it was the loudest I have ever had to listen to. Yes, the beds are a little hard too but it didn't bother us too much as we were always so tired and fell asleep fast. Food - The buffet had a good variety of food and always something for our picky eater boys. It's not gourmet by any means but tasty enough to enjoy it. My boys and husband LOVED the freshly made donuts each morning. The snack bar was also good and served a variety of things throughout the afternoon. The pizza there was good too. The A La Carte restaurants were excellent. We were able to book all three on the day of our arrival for various evenings through our week. Can't say I have a favourite as they were all very good and a nice break to be served instead of self-serving at the buffet. There was also a variety of drinks at all the bars. The mojitos were my favourite! Staff - The staff work very very hard at this resort - from the guy who squeegies the pool deck all day to the entertainment staff, bar tenders and maids. Sure, not all were the friendliest but the jobs were getting done. A special thanks to the entertainment staff who work very hard to keep the young and young at heart entertained throughout each and every day. I didn't stay up for the night shows (too tired after all that sun) but my boys did and they enjoyed those as well. They especially enjoyed volley ball, water polo and of course the trapese. Beach - The beach is nice but pales in comparison to say Punta Cana, DR or Cayo Coco, Cuba. The sand bags didn't bother us and serve their purpose but definitely take away from the \"pristine beach\" look and feeling. The water was also very wavy every day - great for the older kids to dive in the waves but hard for the little ones to enjoy beach time. I hear it is windy there most of the time. There were obvious signs of serious erosion along the hotel strip too and they regularly pump sand up from the deeper water to keep it from washing away. Although after walking south past all the resorts, the beach does get a lot nicer and more \"natural\" looking. The beach at the Viva Wyndham is one of the roomiest and nicest beaches along that strip. Crowd - Well, it was a very busy week this past week at the Viva Wyndham (Apr 5-12). There are a LOT of young people and when you cram them along with the adults by the pool and beach, it's not very roomy at all. This bothered me a bit (I'm normally used to more personal space) but again, I was aware of the size of the resort and how busy it was likely to be so was prepared to accept the lack of space and beach chairs - especially in shade. Grounds - The grounds are really beautiful. I loved the walkways and all the greenery and trees. The staff work hard at keeping it very lush. The open area in front of the lobby is also very nice to sit and relax in the evening. For a small resort sandwiched between so many others, you really don't feel all that squished so it is laid out really nice. It is really just the pool and beach area that you might feel it is not big enough when the hotel is busy. Pool - A previous poster was right. The tiles in the pool are getting a little grungy (mold growing around the corners and the bottom of the pool was slippery). So no, the water was not prisine in the pool either but it is not surprising considering how busy it was so I avoided it. Of course my concerns were not enough to worry about the kids going in it and they spent a LOT of time there. We didn't bother with the quiet pool because we wanted to be able to keep an eye on our kids but we did walk up there and it is very pleasant (but still busy). Off resort - It's more like a 30 minute walk to PDC (we walk briskly) and try and go in the morning or evening when its not so hot if you are walking. $5 for a cab ride there. The little plaza across the street was very nice - in fact, you could find just about any keepsake you wanted over there and enjoyed going over in the evenings for a stroll. There is a bankmachine there if you want to withdraw pesos. I'm giving this resort an overall rating of \"very good\" because it met our expectations for the price we paid. We've stayed from 3.5 to 5 stars in the past and depending on what we are looking for, we can usually have our expectations met by doing a lot of research on a particular resort - and the Viva Wyndham fit the bill I'm sure my boys would give it a 5 star because they really had a fantastic time and for us, that was our priority for us this year so we were happy with our choice. Just bare in mind different people have different expectations so just do a lot of research and make your own judgment for what's important to you and what's not - there is certainly enough info out there to guide you. Day trips - We did a day trip to Cozumel and rented a convertible ($40US per day) and drove around the island. We rented from ISIS - very resonable and no hidden costs. The beaches are really spectacular away from the touristy areas. Unfortunately, we couldn't do the snorkling we wanted that day because of the wind but still enjoyed our drive. We had lunch at a beach called San Fransisco Beach - which was very busy but lots of cruise ships in that day and food was fantastic. We also did a day trip to Xel-Ha. Again, the kids had a fantastic time and loved all the different paths, lazy river, snorkling, cenotes, manate, watching dolphins and things to do. I was specifically looking forward to the snorkling. Unfortunately, I was not that impressed for all the hype it gets. Perhaps the waves were stirring up the sand and it was really busy so visability wasn't as good as it might be at other times. But for a family of four, $400 US (more or less) for the day is a little pricey - so be sure this is what you want to do before investing the money (swimming with dolphins will be another $400).", "Date": "April 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cThe Bonus of a Trapeze at the Beach\u201d", "Author": "TexasTazzer", "ReviewID": "UR27911554", "Content": "We have visited Viva Maya several times.

They were really clean, and the housekeeping staff went above and beyond with cleaning. The rooms were also nice and cool \u2013 which is great to come back to after a long, hot day on the beach. I had no problem with the bed or pillows like other people have complained about \u2013 I thought they were perfectly fine. RESORT \u2013 Honestly....amazing. It was so clean, and beautiful. The little covered paths to follow to get to each area of the resort were nice \u2013 you could see the animals in the bushes as you walked the paths. Everything was laid out really nicely \u2013 close enough together so you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re walking miles to get to everything, but spacey so it definitely doesn\u2019t feel cramped. The BEACH \u2013 Gorgeous. A lot of people have complained about the sand bags that line the resort\u2019s beach. Didn\u2019t bother me or any of my friends at all \u2013 some people are just too picky. The water was pristine, and the beach was just as clean. My friends and I would walk down to the beach at around 9 in the morning, and have absolutely no problem finding beach chairs for all of us......we didn\u2019t have to wake up at no 5 in the morning just to reserve a chair. And there were five of us \u2013 and we had no problems. The POOLS \u2013 I never actually made it into the main pool, because I spent most of my time at the adult pool. So nice. It\u2019s quiet and relaxing, with a pool bar right next to it \u2013 and you\u2019re not getting splashed by people playing in the water \u2013 it\u2019s pure relaxation (plus, it was right next to our hotel rooms....I\u2019d wake up in the morning, walk a few steps, and be at the bar and pool.) The FOOD \u2013 So good. The buffet was so tasty \u2013 there were so many options to choose from. And I\u2019m an EXTREMELY picky eater, and I don\u2019t like to try many new foods \u2013 but I ALWAYS found something at the buffet. We ate at the a la carte restaurants three times \u2013 the Mediterranean, the Mexican, and the Italian restaurants \u2013 and OMG. All three were some of the best food I\u2019ve ever eaten, but my favourite would DEFINITELY be the Italian. So good. ENTERTAINMENT \u2013 Probably the best part of the trip. The shows were awesome. We went to all of them but two (just because we had other plans). It really was all great fun, and I\u2019m definitely going to miss the Viva Dance ;) STAFF \u2013 The staff we encountered the most were the entertainers \u2013 and they made our trip what it was...amazing. It was nice that after meeting them, they remembered who we all were and would constantly come over and say hi to us, and talk with us...... Overall, we all had an AMAZING experience at the Viva Wyndham Maya. The weather was perfect, and the resort was absolutely what we were looking for.

There is lots of good to say about some things at this resort but some things that need a LOT for work. Location - this hotel is well situated in the Playa del Carmen hotel Zone. It is right across the street from the Playacar shopping plaza and a five minute, five dollar cab ride to fifth avenue. It seemed very safe and was very clean. Rooms - were not very impressive. We stayed in Building One, which is in dire need of renovation. I have stayed in many places and this was the worst bed ever - a hard, old mattress on a concrete slab made a good nights sleep impossible. There were no dressers in the rooms so you spent the week literally living out of a suitcase. There were no clock radios. There were no face cloths and the odd hand towel in the wash rooms. There is no soap in the showers, unless you want to run over to the sink to get some soap from the dispenser and rush back to the shower. The control for the shower didn't work but we figured it out and some of the caulking looked like it had been there for 20 years. Pool - if you want a good spot, get there early (before 730). Towels were not an issue. The pool was nice and clean and adequate for the size of the resort. One concern - there is only one ladder in the whole pool to get in and out. And, the top rung on the ladder is missing, which made it difficult, or impossible, for older or larger, people to use the pool. Staff - was GREAT and ENTHUSIASTIC. They are always involved with all guests and seemed to enjoy their jobs. Special kudos to Melissa and Elias and Raul from the front desk. Food - the three a la carte restaurants were all good - no complaints. Getting reservations was easy - just go down at 730 your first morning and you'll get everything you want. The buffet has some issues. The room is VERY hot, even when the windows are open. And, a lot of food sits out for a long time and doesn't look very good. Six of the eight of us were sick at some point and we think it was because of the buffet.

Despite tipping the housekeeping staff fairly well, we never received enough towels for the amount of guests. Some days we didn't receive bathmats or faceclothes. The rooms themselves are older and in need of TLC. Our toilet lid wouldn't stay up because the bathroom counter extended beyond where it should have!

If your travel agent or company sold it to you as a 4*, that's their fault. This resort is quite small which was very nice, as no matter where your room is you can get to everything quite quickly. We stayed at some where it was a 15-minute walk to the beach from the kids club, so this was a nice change. We booked this hotel because of the decent price and because the Kids Club was rated well (we have a 4 year-old). Remember if you expect a 5* then you should stay at a 5* because otherwise you won't be very happy on your trip. Having stayed at other huge all inclusives in Cozumel, Dominican Republic & Cuba, here are some + and -'s: The rooms: The rooms were clean and big, our bath room looked as though it had very recently been re-done. These are no frills rooms, but still comfy. The beds have a mattress on a concrete slab, so if you have a bad back you may suffer. There are no fridges but the pool bar is open very late & the snack bar as well, so no real need for a fridge if you really think about it. There are ice buckets to keep your bottled water cold if you want. There are also no face cloths, so if you need them, bring them or buy a couple at Wal-mart in town. Activities: There are plenty of activities going on, lots of people learning to dance, water polo, archery, large gym, trapeze, etc. We have stayed in places where the constant whistles & loud music made it hard to relax. Not a problem here, they may politely ask you if you want to play or do something, but that's it. My sister was at the Riu Palace and said there were no activities to do though it was a much nicer hotel. People: A good mix of people (older, younger, and families), also European, Canadian, Latin American & American. It was the US spring break so there were some rowdy ones that were quite drunk by noon'ish. Most left for town clubs early in the evening. Food: There is the main buffet, 3 restaurants and one pool snack bar. The main buffet was fine, remember they are catering to many different ethnicities. The eggs were too runng, but there was never a time when I couldn't find anything to eat. A fresh donut station, omelet station, lots of fruit and fresh bread, even a bloody mary station! Every meal has chicken, pork, beef etc just done differently each time. There were never any lines, like other big resorts we have been to. Our 4 yr-old loved all the choices. The 3 restaurants were all decent, with several courses and choices to make. The staff at all 3 were superb, going out of their way to accommodate our little one (including making a special meal for our 4 yr-old at the Italaian one). The pool snack bar has awesome pizza, and a small buffet, you can also order hamburgers etc. The bars were fine, don't forget to tip once in a while if you appreciate the service. And don't butt in the line...nobody will die of thirst waiting! We never went to the nite club so I can't comment. The grounds are lovely, there are cute little rodents that are harmless and quite tame, lots of iguanas around. The pool was fine, although people \"holding lounge chairs\" all day is quite annoying, but a problem at all the resorts we have been to. Perhaps if people started taking and turning in their towels so they had to pay the $20 for losing them this might stop as we saw empty chairs that nobody returned to for four hours. I decided this hotel was quite eco-friendly. No little bottles of shampoo and soap, but instead there are dispensers that are regularly re-filled. The plastic cups for drinks are washable, which was better than other resorts that used disposable & had mountains of them everywhere, including the beach. Our 4 yr-old enjoyed the Kids Club, but you can't book a tour and pay the staff to come early or stay late as we have done at other places (they work split shifts to work the shows at night). The shows were my biggest disappointment, as some performers danced well and others couldn't so the choreography was always off. They should import some Cubans or Domincians for this, as their shows were always perfect! Our 4 yr-old loved them anyway, so it was fine.", "Date": "March 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "ontario", "Title": "\u201cso much fun\u201d", "Author": "hurf", "ReviewID": "UR27030000", "Content": "This resort is great fun.

We could always find something to eat, The reservation system may not be perfect, but don't judge it by empty tables in the restaurant. You don't know how many people were \"no shows\" for their seating time, and the resort probably errs on the side of scheduling too much time for a table to eat, but that is better then scheduling too close. The bars and bartenders were great, and they didn't seem to skimp on the booze. The acitivities staff was GREAT and tried to get people involved. The trapeze was great and the staff awesome.

The staff was outstanding. Did they ever go home to sleep as they were always gathering groups for beach volleyball and salsa lessons, entertaining us with a new show each night and then dancing until the wee hours in the disco. We spent most of the daytime on the beach or at the activity pool. The beach was pristine and the waters beautiful. There was lots of shade, although you had to LITERALLY stake claim on your chairs and shade starting at 5 AM!! We are grateful to the early-risers in our group who assumed that chore. There's gotta be a better system. There is also another \"quiet\" pool off the beach that is a nice option for those who don't want all the action and activities. The BEST activity was the trapeze! Several of the girls took advantage of that new offering and LOVED IT. The staff was professional and talented, and was able to teach and encourage even the most fearful in our group! You can be sure that photos and videos of their \"flying with the greatest of ease\" were quickly added to the girls' Facebook pages upon arrival home. THANK YOU to the awesome trapeze staff for a fun and memorable accomplishment. And, note that there were kids as young as 5-6 years old up on the trapeze -- wow. We were impressed by how the resort was organized to accommodate many different ages, tastes and expectations, ie: there was something for everyone from little kids to a bunch of teenagers to adults looking for some rest and relaxation. Okay, now to the not so good part: the food and restaurant reservation system. It's a good thing we didn't go on vacation for the food so we weren't too disappointed; BUT being \"stuck\" in the buffet for two of the four nights because we couldn't get reservations at the other restaurants was ridiculous. We followed the rules and were up early and first in line to secure reservations, yet it took about 45 minutes to go through the process, and all we could get was the very last seating those two nights and we were separated into several small groups. Our last night together, we had to dine at DIFFERENT restaurants and at DIFFERENT times. HERE's THE KICKER: THE RESTAURANTS WERE EMPTY! We counted 76 empty seats at one of the restaurants. And, it didn't matter the time of the evening: from 6:30 pm until the last seating, we would walk by restaurants and notice the empty tables. Some might think this is by design: limit the numbers in the more expensive to operate restaurants and send the majority of the guests to the \"mess hall\" as one earlier reviewer referred to the buffet. That last night was a real disappointment, so we spoke w/ a manager the next day who said he agreed that we should have been able to sit together, at the same time, at the same restaurant -- it was not an unusual nor unrealistic request, and he promised to look into the problem and make the appropriate changes. If you have more than 4 people traveling to the Viva, I'd first ensure this problem was fixed before I booked. I want to end this review on the positive though, because we really had a great time and the Viva was a good choice in terms of value, location (walked to town and great beach), fun activities and a charming staff.", "Date": "March 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely on it's way down...\u201d", "Author": "Bubbaluey", "ReviewID": "UR26818710", "Content": "My wife and I went to the Wyndham in 2007 and had an excellent experience.

The employees were very friendly and very helpful, we absolutely loved the buffet. Overall, we had a wonderful time. When we decided to take the kids this year, we thought it would be great to take them to the Wyndham as we had really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed. The hotel has had no upkeep and looks more run down than I thought. The buffet was terrible! Two years ago we would load our plates with as many different things as we could because everything looked and tasted so good. This year was the exact opposite. The first day we took quite a bit (and were not impressed) and by the end of the week we hardly ate anything at all. You would think that it would be tough to ruin breakfast, but they had no problem doing it. The pancakes, french toast, bacon, eggs and whatever else you would eat for breakfast was absolutely terrible. The other thing we found annoying was that there must be a hundred empty lounge chairs on the beach with towels on them (that never get used), and it is almost impossible to find more than one without a towel anywhere close to each other. When I looked on the internet, I saw the Windham ranked as a 4 star. This is a myth. I would rank the resort at no better than a three star.

This bring me to say that Viva Wyndham Maya is an alright Hotel, little outdated and may be need couple of renovations, but then you are not there to stay in the room. Also, we deffenetly picked a wrong season, the Hotel was kind of quiet and daily activities weren't as fun as some other places I've been to in the Carribean. Some of the staff was very friendly and nice and others not so much. Fran\u00e7ois from France was of great help, in regards to nightly activities and people around the resourt. He did tell my husband not to talk to people that sell trips outside of the resourt, since they tend to try to sell you crap like \"Time share\" for as low as your morgage. If you are not there to buy timeshares, then do not talk to the guys that sell trips outside of the resourt. The food is ok, the buffet is not as good as Riu resorts and a bit of a lower standard. I refused to eat at a snack bar, since it smelled like someone puked around there. Though \"a la cart\" was awesome, Mexican and Italian Resto's were amazing. Thankfully Fran\u00e7ois told us to book it right when we got there. Also, they are very strict when it comes to dress code in those specialty restaurants. The site seeing trips are great, but we could only have the time to take one. I've been to this area 6 times and seen it all.

You do not have to be a superstar to enjoy this activity (my husband) because the staff are amazing and provide excellent instruction. My husband was swinging in a matter of minutes (not to gracefully but lots of fun) and the staff cheers you on as does all the spectators. This activity really is a great highlight to all that participated and even the guests that sat and watched had a great time. The trapezing staff also put on a great show one night for the nightly entertainment. Great Job guys! The beach was nice and probably the best around this area. The only issue is if you are not an early riser you might not get a lounger (hotel was full). Pool was nice with daily water polo ( my son is now a big fan) and crazy games (surf board, belly flop competitions) all very fun to join or to watch. Rooms..yes they are a little dated, we stayed in the old section but they were very clean and the view from our room was fantastic. Grounds were well kept and nice to look at. Nightly entertainment was ok. Located in Playacar complex and very safe. Had no problem walking around off the resort. There is a small shopping complex right across the street that even has a starbucks and the town of Playa del Carmen is a 5 minute $5.00 cab ride away. Playa del Carmem rocks at night.

We booked 3 a la cartes, one at the Aztec which is a 4 minute walk down the beach or road and it was fantastic (italian). Also at the Maya we booked the mediteran and italian and both were ok. There is also a buffet beside the pool that made great fries. The best part of our trip are the activities, trapeze, beach volley ball, water polo, archery and lots of things to do all day long.

We ended up dealing with the Sunset Group outside Playacar at Antigua Plaza were told that we would get our money back plus tickets to the attractions if we went to their 90 minute presentation. Needless to say 90 minutes turned into 4 hours at Hacienda Tres Rios where they would not take no for an answer on buying into their property. We finally got out of there with a really bad tast in our mouth for Mexico. As for our hotel stay, it was comfortable. The beach was beautiful. The rooms were clean but for some reason we always had a mysterious puddle on our floor after the maids left. Our room was right outside the theatre and poolside bar/snack areaq which made it impossible to get a good nights sleep with the patio door open. It cooled off at night so we didnt need the ac on but with partygoers at the bar until 3in the morning we learned very quickly to close the patio door. As for the food it was definitely nothing to write home about. Half of he time we still left the buffet starving because of the random non appealing dishes they were serving. Breakfast was the most enjoyable meal of the day. The fresh croissants, fruit, bacon sausage & fresh sunny side up eggs was what we ate every single day. My girfriend enjoyed the homeade hot chocolate which I must say was pretty tasty as well. When making a reservation for one of the ala carte restaraunts you have to do it between the hours of 8am-2pm. Well I was there at 8:10am and was told they were completely booked but we could eat at the Italian restaraunt at their sister hotel (Viva Azteca) down the road. So we did and the food was presented pretty and was nice to look at but we were starving afterwards so we raced back to our hotel to beat the buffet before they closed. The snack bar at the pool area was not great at all, half the time the food was cold they were always running out of items and if you wanted to eat something after midnight the food at the snack bar was the food left over from the dinner buffet.

From the information given, and since the pricing at the time seemed really reasonable we went ahead with the booking. We left on Mar 6th and returned on Mar 13th. That was the most disappointing resort we have ever stayed at. It should never be considered such a rating. On arrival we were placed on ground level. The first night I had been bite twice during the night in the bed, and the noise level was terrible in that area from the housekeeping in the morning, never mind the other guests. We asked to be moved but they told us to come back the next day. The second night my husband got bite in the bed, and we had strange noises coming out of the air conditioner as if something was stuck in there. It does seem they have a bug problem either from the natural setting right outside, or a major bed bug problem. We went to the front desk and they told us to come back around 1pm. My husband did and they gave us a key to check out another room. We went up there it appeared to be in better shape, and in a better area. Housekeeping was cleaning it and said to come back in an hour. We went for lunch and grabbed our stuff to move it to the other room (they would not do it). When we got back up there to the new room, someone had broke in. The door jam was broken and the door was open with the dead bolt on. I stayed with our stuff and my husband went to get someone, they came and it seemed to not be a big deal for them. They got maintenance to come fix the door jam and told us to take the room. We did, but were uneasy about it. The one benefit, it did turn out to be a quiet room. As for the staff, the majority of them were not very friendly and did not care to be of any service to us (whether you tipped or not, or how much). There was a lot of staff available, but they seemed to only clean up after people and not do anything else. You were lucky to get a cup of coffee in the morning, and most of the time you had to serve yourself on every aspect. They allow you to book three times in the A la cart restaurants, but most of the time they say it is booked up... then when you are there, the restaurant is maybe half full. The food is okay, the amount of selection is about the most saving grace. They cram so many chairs on the beach that you feel like sardines unless you are lucky enough to be on the edges. We asked for a 7AM wake up call and received it almost a half hour late, apparently the same thing happened to another family that was on our same flight. I will say that the location, the design of the place, the activities and the nightly entertainment is about all I can tell positive things to people. After meeting a family from Denver (USA), a family from Italy, another family from the Yukon and another family from Alberta, then a couple from Minnesota (USA), a couple from Ontario, and then another couple from Alberta.... not one of us would ever recommend or stay at this resort ever again. One of the families stayed there two years ago and loved it, now they can not believe how much it has gone down hill and where so disappointed they spent their money and time to such a place. On the plane and at the airport just talking to other people in general, some had heard negative things and were not surprised to hear so many of us where unhappy when they found out where we were staying. I am hesitant to go to these places just based on the ratings. My husband and I are considering taking our children next year, however, it is going to be tough to know where the better places are to go or with who, based on this awful experience.

Closer to our departure date, I finally found one from a couple who were married in November; they wrote really great things, and that made me feel much less apprehensive about the whole event. So I want to help out other brides with this review. When planning your wedding with this resort you will be put in contact with an excellent wedding planner, Marco. Marco was great to deal with and never seemed to be bothered by my two million emails! At first we were planning on getting married in Calgary and then doing the renewal of vows in Mexico, but after hearing how easy it was to get married there we changed our plans and went with the classic wedding package. When you get to Mexico, Marco sets up an appointment with the on-site doctor to get your blood test. This has to be done 3 days prior to your wedding. Marco then requires about an hour of your time for you to select your set up, flowers, and to review how everything will be done. Your witnesses need to sign off on some documents and then you are done! It was so easy and Marco just made everything happen. It really was prefect! The salon on-site, wow\u2026\u2026 the stylist did such an amazing job with my hair. We got the music package which was prefect. The package included a five piece mariachis band that played for guests after the ceremony (while pictures were being taken and sparking wine was being served), a solo guitarist played during dinner, and a DJ played from 8:30 \u2013 11:30 for the party after dinner. We brought a CD with our first song and father daughter dance (just in case) and then the DJ took care of the rest. Just keep in mind a couple of things regarding payments; the doctor and photographer require a cash payment (paid in US), but the wedding package was billed to our room. We had two photographers. They arrive at your room 30 minutes before the wedding to take individual pictures of just the bride and then the groom. The disc we bought had over 1,000 pictures on it and we felt that they did a very good job. This is how our wedding unfolded: the actual ceremony started at 4:00 and lasted no more than 15 -20 minutes, then my husband and I took off with the photographers for pictures around the grounds and on the beach as our guests stayed behind drinking sparkling wine and listening to the Mariachis band, when we returned we had group shots and family and bridal party shots taken, and then we were done. Guests then arrived at the poolside restaurant that overlooked the ocean at 6:30 and the bridal party entered soon after. We had dinner (the food was excellent), had our first dance and speeches, cut the cake, and then danced until 11:30. Unfortunately we couldn\u2019t pay extra to keep the restaurant open and the DJ on longer, although we and our guests certainly tried. After that some guest went to the disco and some hung out at the pool bar. Don\u2019t be surprised when you find a HUGE crowd (other resort guests) of onlookers taking pictures and video taping your wedding ceremony. We even saw some strangers crying!! It is crazy but fun all at the same time! Also note, you have to have 50 people to have the restaurant to yourselves, so we just paid for the extra meals and it was well worth it if you have a big group! All I have to say is everything was excellent; we would do it again in a heartbeat! Marco was amazing and you will love him! Thank you Marco.... Oh, we had a group of 41 people in total. I sent Marco our guest list and asked if he could try to keep us all together\u2026 he made that happen as well. Resort: The resort is small and nice, and it was easy for us to find our friends and family. The only problem with a small resort is the pool and beach loungers go VERY fast. Friends were out at 7:00 a.m. and were still not able to find enough. We made do, but people save those loungers very, very early\u2026 so if you are not an early riser, you are not going to get one! A towel on the beach always works though. (Could have been the week we were there as well, busy with University Reading Week). There are two pools - the adult pool which was quiet and shady and the main pool which was busy and sunny. We didn\u2019t have a problem with either. The resort staff are awesome and very friendly. The beach was nice and water clear and calm (on most days). The huge sand bags on the beach are ugly, but they are there to help restore the beach and you get over it fast. The resort and rooms are clean but the rooms/pool are really in need of renovations, the food was okay (50/50 with friends and family). We only went to one a la carte restaurant which was the Mexican and we all thought it was excellent. The bedrooms were nothing to write home about; but the one thing that surprised me was that our parents and some friends got king sized beds but the couple getting married got two queens?? Go figure! Marco was going to get that changed for us, but we told him not to worry about it. Right across the street there is a little mall market where you can do some shopping, but it is a bit cheaper if you go into town. Going into town is a US$5 taxi or a 20 minute hot walk!! You are in a complex called Playacar where you feel very safe to go for walks or a run. If you are a hockey fan, we found a little spot on the main strip in Playa Del Carmen called EZ (End Zone) that airs the games. I have attached a few pictures to give you an idea of set up, flowers, and hairdo. Keep in mind there are more set-ups available and a whole book of flower arrangements.", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sk canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat First Experience ...\u201d", "Author": "geneSkCanada", "ReviewID": "UR25899362", "Content": "... for an all inclusive.

The tour and hotel staff were competent and friendly ... get used to saying OLA! Avoid being annoyed by all the operators who want to be your amigo .. be polite, say no and life is great. We were formally told that tipping was not necessary, but that didn't stop the hinting for tip money ... besides we were prepared to tip the bus driver ... house keeper ... bar tender ... etc. We came prepared with a lot of $1 U.S. bills. The around the clock beverages and food/snacks were okay. The main dining hall featured a variety of buffet items and cooks to make simple dishes. Our favourite was the fresh donuts made every morning. We picked and chose food items that were familiar and there was enough to keep us satisfied. Feeding the masses doesn't require signature dishes, but the Mexican a la carte restaurant that we attended did a pretty nice job. Weather was fabulous. Yes the wind made life somewhat annoying and there were days that being in the water wasn't safe ... we saw one person get carried out to the warning buoys and fortunately rescued. However, once you RESERVE your beach lounger under the canopy ... lay back, enjoy the warmth of the sun, read a book, listen to music and you can easily forget about the winter temps and snow ... don't forget that just because you are on vacation your not immune to sun burn. The location to Playa del Carmen is just a perfect 20- 30 minute walk and leads right onto the main tourist shops. There aren't that many shopping deals ... especially if you were to compare prices to the Wal Mart in the area. But we were satisfied with the trinkets that were available. As well the Scotia Bank ATM in the area was easy to use. The hotel room did an adequate job ... we expected the beds to be rock hard, but we appreciated the firmness.

I would have really liked for them to do a show for us, but because the trapeze was a new addition to the hotel(since december) they were still in the practicing stage for a show. Hopefully next year we can see one. The food here was good. The pizza at the snack bar was excellent. The staff in the resteraunts were very helpful and friendly(they always brought us drinks).

Had we paid any more money I would have been disappointed. All of the other reviews are pretty accurate. We usually vacation at 3/4 star resorts and found this one to be on par or a little below par to the other resorts. The ambiance of the buffer hall leaves a LOT to be desired. We walked over to the sister hotel and it has a MUCH nicer place to eat at the buffet. I found the buffet area to be big, loud and felt like a cafeteria...referred to as the Mess Hall. There was a lot of different choices for breakfast and dinner...all average. We are used to fresh omlettes being made by cracking open fresh eggs, insteade here they had a huge vat of pre mixed eggs and they just didn't taste as good as freshly cracked ones. The ala carte resteraunts were all good, good service and nicer area to eat at. Very hard to get reservations for large groups and found that if you asked a few times (nicely) you would get what you wanted. I found it very interesting to talk to a girl at 8am and told that everything was booked and four hours later talk to someone else and we were able to get reservations. As others have made note the beach is nice, the entertainment staff were good and the rooms are basic, but kept clean. I had read a lot about the long bus trip to the resort and had even planned to take a private shuttle as I didn't want to be stuck on a bus for two hours after a five hour flight. In the end we decided to go with the shuttle provided as a few other people I emailed said it wasn't that bad. Well, they must have been on a shuttle that only stopped at a few hotels prior to ours. We arrived at the airport at 2:00, got on the bus at 4:00...then took a 2.5 hour bus ride to the resort. We first stopped at four other resorts..plus a resort we didn't need to stop at...ooops by the bus driver...then the bus driver drove past one resort and had to turn around...no kidding! So, needless to say at 4:40 (which is how long a private shuttle would have taken) we had not even made it to the first stop:( So, I would highly, highly recommend taking a private shuttle TO the hotel! The ride back to the airport was easy..and who wants to rush home...but I really recommend spending the $$ and get to your hotel in 40 minutes....not 2 hours and 40 minutes. The other down side as others have noted is the gym hours...8am! I have never been at a resort where you can't get into the gym until someone arrives to sit in the gym and do nothing but watch you work out. I am very capable of working on the gym equipment without a supervisor and 8am really was too late! For some it likely doesn't matter, but I would rather work out in the morning before everyone gets up. Instead I would walk into PDC and then run back to the hotel. Very safe area to run and there are lots of runners out at 6am. Would I recommend the hotel...likely not. I beleive vacations are what you make of them....but if I was to go back I would try somewhere else and recommend family and friends to check out another place...especially once that had a nicer buffet area...once that had open air seating and more relaxing and less noisy. PS I read a lot about the smokers....and it really wasn't too bad. I found there to be a constant breeze and it blew the smoke away for the most part and beleive me...I really don't like to sit by smokers.

The beach is nice. Its too bad that it is so competitive to get a beach lounger. I think it would be nice if the resort enforced its policy for saving beach loungers. Pool is nice but too small. It would have been nice to have a hot tub there in the evenings. The animation team is amazing and the kids enjoyed the kids show at 9 every evening. The 9:45 shows were also a hit. The a'la cart restaurants are hard to get big groups into but well worth it. Wasn't that fussy about the buffet restaurant. Ok for breakfast lots of variety. For dinner really no fresh vegetables to choose from. Not many cooked vegetables either. Enjoyed the deserts and icecream. Really watch that the meat is cooked in the buffet. My daughter had a hamberger that I thought looked cooked turned out to be almost raw in the middle. Also we ran into chicken that was still pink in the middle. The building in the buffet has a lot to be desired. It is loud and seems more like a cafeteria. The trough as our group called it. The snack bar was well liked for lunch. The pizza was fantastic but you usually had to wait to get a slice as it was very popular. I recommend taking one of the bikes from the hotel into town. It's a nice ride and you can see lots. out group of 12 rented a private van with a driver and planned our own excursions. We saw Coba, an underground senote snoreled at the lagoon Yal Ku one day.

It is not a big resort but have all the commodity of a bigger one. The staff was friendly and you can see that they work hard to make you a great holiday. We mostly stay around the pool and the beach. My children have 4 and 7, for this reason, it was impossible for me to stay late in the night and see the disco and the every night shows. Things to improve: 1. The shows (for the children) are too late.... 9 PM (and 9h45) is too late. Young children are tired after a full day under the sun. 2. The main pool is pretty old and the spa doesn't work anymore (notice that they still have a spa for the adult far from the beach). It might be a very very good idea to replace the ceramic and repair the spa. 3. I read comments about the rooms near the beach saying that they are pretty old. My room was OK. It wasn't a luxury suite but clean and enough for me. The only negative point about my room was the air conditioning. Yes it was working, but it wasn't pumping humidity from the air! So, my nights were cold and humid.... We are coming from the North.... And we are used to DRY and COLD air.... I suggest to install \"dehumidifier system\" in parallel to the air conditioning system. This will (and I am pretty sure) please a lot of guest!! The humidity inside the room was the worst thing about this hotel.

They have serious problem to keep the sand in place since Hike and...all the others. During the night they pumping sand from the the sea to bring it back on the beach. In fact, all the resort on this part of the coast as the same problem. May be this resort has the best beach. If you walk south about 15 minutes, just after the Sandos, you will reach a wild beach in good condition. Do not hesitate to go outside the resort and walk around Playacar, it is a protected area. I took a few walk before going to bed. I suggest you to take a bicycle (free at the hotel) and go around. The hotel is inside the Playacar Phase II. You may go in Playacar Phase I. They have nice beach. Downtown Playa del Carmen (in fact this is the real city), is pretty cool. A place to go during the night or the day.

Upon arrival we were quick through check in..we did have an issue with our room as we did not have the king size bed and the fridge as requested. We weren't able to change our room until the following day and never did get the king size bed but it was nice to have the fridge for cold water. The rooms was always clean and tidy. Our balcony had lots of space and not a bad few of the water. We were on the back side of the building but if you looked over the edge you could see the water. The air conditioner was a little loud but not bad. Most nights we could get enough of a breeze through the patio door that we slept with it open and left the air conditioner off. The bed was hard because there was no boxspring but I didn't find it an issue. We were too sleepy at night to even notice. We did see a room in the new building back by the adult pool and they were nice. Brand new beds, a large bathroom with jet tub and large tile shower, with a separate toilet area. If you think you will have an issue with the older room I would suggest asking for a room in the new building by the adult pool when you are checking in. It was a farther walk from the beach (5 mins) and it was central air so you couldn't control the air conditioner but worth the request if you are looking for a more luxurious room. The food was ok..there was a very good selection at the buffet restaurant. I am a fussy eater but I could always find something to eat. We found that breakfast was the best meal as it was very Americanized and tasted just like home. The snack bar by the beach and pool had a nice selecion for lunch. Hamburgers and frires, fresh fruit, pasta etc. We ate there most days for lunch as we could sit with our bathing suits on or take our food right down to the beach and sit in our chairs. We did eat at two of the specialty restaurants and didn't have much luck. My husband was sick both nights after we ate there but I am not totally blaming the food. I preferred the buffet but it was nice to dress up and go on a little date and have someone serve you. The serving staff was great and willing to please! We were always up around 6am which left just enough time to get down to the beach and get a chair. Most people did that and I would recommend it as it was always nice to know we had a chair. We never had an issue with someone taking our chair either and we could leave our shirts and shoes right there and not fear that someone would steal it. I never left my camera down there though just in case. The staff for the most part was really nice. Some of the staff at the front desk weren't all the nice but the staff in the restaurants and at the bar were VERY nice and happy to please, making jokes and always laughing. We didn't go to a lot of the shows as the sun drained us most days and we wanted to enjoy the day on the beach more then the night life. But the ones that we saw were really funny and entertaining. The beach was the best we had seen. We walked 5 hotels one way and then 5 hotels the other and ours was the best. Not too many large sand bags and a large area to swim. We went to Tulum for our excursion and it was interesting. It was very hot that day so I would recommend taking LOTS of water as there isn't anywhere to buy it once you get in there. The beach there was also beautiful! No sand bags there. I would also suggest going into Playa Del Carmen. We didn't buy anything in the city but it was neat to walk around into all of the shops. The market across from the hotel was nice too. We found most of our deals there and you can ALWAYS barter the price. All in all we are very happy with our vacation.

We were a party of 6 with 2 children ages 2 and 6. Last year we stayed at the sister resort the Azteca. For the money the Maya is a good deal. There were a few minor issues such as one shower didn\u2019t function and there were 3 trips by the maintenance crew and 1 toilet didn\u2019t flush well. One mini bar was never stocked while the other was always stocked. The rooms we stayed need drawer space as there isn\u2019t any kind of dresser. As is usually the case, the beds are hard due the fact there are no box springs\u2026\u2026just a mattress on a concrete slab. That seems to be typical of the mid level resorts. The grill by the pool couldn\u2019t keep up with the quantity of guests. We ate in all 3 ala carte restaurants. .I would recommend 2 of the 3. The Italian restaurant above the bar adjacent the pool was a disappointment. The Mediterranean and the Mexican restaurants were excellent. The service was excellent at all the ala carte restaurants. I would suggest making reservations the day you arrive as it is very difficult to get a reasonable time slot and as we were initially informed, reservations had to be made daily which is incorrect. The buffet food is decent and there is no lack of variety. If you are expecting gourmet type food at the buffet, you certainly will be disappointed. The smokers can be annoying, but I noticed fewer smokers at the Maya then at most of the resorts I\u2019ve stayed. Nonetheless, a few well placed \u201cNo Smoking\u201d signs or designated smoking areas would be appreciated. As is normally the case, most guests place towels on the lounge chairs to reserve them for the day. Maybe half generally are used at any given time. This always annoys us. The resort seemed to be fully occupied while we were there and finding a lounge chair was difficult several days. People also place lounge chairs within inches of the swimming pool and then complain if they get splashed. There are plenty of activities to partake including the trapeze (morning for kids and afternoons for adults), the kids club and kids nightly disco, nightly shows, archery, bingo, dance classes, etc. The nightly shows are for the most part good although there were a few that were less then entertaining. The disco isn\u2019t utilized much by the guests with the exception of the first half hour while the entertainment staff is on duty. As soon as they leave, the disco becomes barren. Like most resorts in Playa del Carmen, you need to walk frequently as the pool and beach are at one end of the resort and the buffet restaurant, front desk and many of the other facilities are at the other end. Also there are no bathrooms at any of the restaurants which I thought was a big downside especially if you have young children. The rooms and facilities are kept clean and tidy. The staff works hard and is attentive. Check in and check out was efficient. As a side trip we went to Xel Ha. The previous year we went to Xcaret. I would recommend Xcaret over Xel Ha due to the close proximity of the resort, the fact the highway to Xel Ha is under reconstruction and there was more to do at Xcaret in addition to the show after the park closes.", "Date": "February 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "upstate new york", "Title": "\u201cGreat bang for the buck!

My husband had concerns on the size of the pool but it was perfect. It would get busy when they played water polo but there was always room for us. The pool bar did get a bit loud and crazy. My 9 year old thought it was funny to see \"drunk\" people.....At times it was a little silly. I have a warning about the pool. My 2 older girls cut their feet quite badly on some sharp tiles in the pool. Took 6 hours for one of them to stop bleeding. Several other hotel guest cut there feet as well. Some required stiches. One is going to need surgery as a tendon was severed. We informed the hotel and did others. I hope they do those repairs soon. The beach was great. Yes there are big black sandbags but i understand they are needed to help with the beach reclamation process. It was so close that we could go down and play in the surf or make sandcastles. We joined in with a lot of the hotel activities. Water polo, volley ball, bingo, crazy games, dance lessons, darts, bocci, ping pong and more. If you wanted something to do you could find something anytime of day. All of my kids did the trapeze with Viva Circus. My oldest even got to do some catches. She was there every morning and afternoon to participate. I loved getting up in the morning and going to the pool bar for a cappuccino and watching the sun come up or just enjoying the peace and quiet. We ate at the Terrace Restaurant for breakfast everyday. Lots of choices and a different theme every day. Lunch was sometimes there but mostly we ate at the pool snack bar. Lots and Lots of choices. Great Mexican salsa. I loved it. We tried all of the a la cart restaurants. Great service and food. Waiters work so hard to give you a great time. Loved the Portafino. Again we usually ate supper at the Terrace. Once the waiters know what you want to drink they bring it to you with out even asking for it. Vendors are at the hotel every Friday and Tuesday. Defiantly cheaper if you go in to playa. We enjoyed bargaining for our purchases. Our Sunwing rep called this the national sport of Mexico. Take the walk in to Playa. Great experience. My kids loved getting the fruit from the vendors. They also have a place near the pool that you can purchase and then paint your own ceramics. Once you are done he adds the details and varnishes it. Our family did several of them. They look great. He is there Monday - Saturday. A couple of tips. If you need to change money or Travelers cheques. Don't do it at the hotel. Across the street is a small market and there is a bank there. Got the best rate for exchange. Make sure you bring your passport for identification if doing travelers cheques. Sunscreen is very expensive here. Over $20 a bottle. Bring your own or the cheapest place is Walmart. We had a great time at the Viva and would recommend it to our friends.

Like others, we read the reviews on this website before we went and weren't sure what to expect. We were there January 29-Feb 5 and had wonderful weather, a bit cool a night which I wasn't quite prepared for. No problem with transport from and to Airport - we booked through AAA. The resort is overall clean, some paint could use touching up. Things do look a bit old in places including the room but no big deal. Others have complained of no dressor or mini fridge or coffee maker - we had all those things in our room and a great ocean view - room 2206 - which we requested ahead of time and I think paid extra for - worth it for me. I think the Maya is the only resort on the strip with room so close to the water. The shower faucet malfunctioned a bit but still plenty of water pressure & hot water which is what I care about. Housekeeping did a great job - we tipped $2 every day. Air conditioner not overally loud - we like to have a white noise at night anyway. The staff is very friendly, great activity staff and plenty to do if you want to get involved. The shows at night were entertaining - we went to 3. The food was overall good, as good as any other resort I've stayed at (including an Iberostar). We ate at the Italian and Mexican resturant and enjoyed both, no problems getting reservations. Buffet food was always good, perhaps the atmosphere could use some updating, can get quite noisy at busy times. Walked into town a couple times, great for a run in the morning. Enjoyed dinner once in town. Booked the Tulum & Xel-Ha trip which was great. Probably paid a bit much but I like the convience and safety feeling of booking at the hotel. Drinks seemed fine, no problems. I'm pregnant so avoided most alcohol, my husband drank mostly beer which he commented could have been colder. They did a nice job of making me some decaf capuccinos. Yes, chairs were always reserved in the morning, but we still didn't have a problem putting together a couple chairs in a nice spot later in the morning. The Maya definately has the best beach on the strip. I recommend this place for the location, comfort and value.

The flight there and back was on schedule. We had no issues with the flight at all. In fact the food was excellent, the service was pretty good. THE ROOM: We arrived Jan 28. We did arrive at around midnight so check-in was pretty quick. We had requested a room on the second floor of the building close to the relax pool, which I was told was the most recent. We did end up getting just that. The only downfall was the balcony which had very little leg room and the view was not that great, but we didn't put too much emphasis on that since we were not there to spend time on our balcony or in our room. The room we stayed in was 3228. The other side you at least get a view of the pool such as room 3215. The room was clean, everything was in working order. We had a safe, the air conditioning worked fine and was not loud like other reviews mentioned. The fridge was not stocked with beer or pop but that didn't bother us. We did get water when we ran out. The maids did make us these cute little things with the towels. The rooms are a tad out dated but your not there to spend time in your room. THE RESORT: The resort itself is situated in an awesome location in Playacar. Just a 20 min walk to Playa del Carmen and a $5 taxi ride to Playa Del Carmen. There is also a little market accross the street that sells clothes, jewelery and a bunch of other things. The area is perfectly safe to walk around day or night. The resort is smaller than what I am normally used to but I actually didn't mind it because there was so much stuff around us. The lobby is a tad small. If it rains, there isn't much room for people to hang out undercover. The landscape is very nice and they really do keep this clean. Everything is so close that you don't have to walk far to get to the pool or beach. They have 5 internet stations which cost 25 pesos for half hour and there was always one available at any given time. The washrooms were always clean. BE AWARE: If you get an envelope requesting you to pick up your VIP gift, they will try to sell you on the VIP Viva service. It takes approx. 1 hour of your time to sit with them and have them explain the advantages of having a VIP service. It might be advantageous to some, however it wasn't for us. It's not timeshare either. THE FOOD: We went to three a la carte restaurants: We didn't care much for the Mexican although many people liked it. We had the quasedillas and they were not that great...maybe other dishes were good. We also hate at the italian restaurant at the Azteca and it was average. The service was excellent in all our a la cartes. Our best was the Italian at the Maya. The buffet provided a good variety of food. We always found things to eat and didn't have any issues with the food. The service was excellent there as well. The pizza and pasta by the poolside was excellent. They always had a variety of food to offer there as well, which I found really nice, because we didn't want to have to leave the beach to go up to the buffet to eat lunch. We could grab a plate at the pool bar and go sit on our beach chairs and eat there. The only thing I would suggest is that you bring your plate back once your done and not leave it on your chair or beach because the seagulls fly around and will pick out of your plate if you leave unattended. THE BEACH: The beach always had chairs available unless you showed up late morning. Yes people do get up early to reserve chairs even though there is a sign asking people not to do this. However I did show at 8:00 and found lots of spots available and I would say chairs are available t'ill around 10:00. The beach is very clean, someone walks around cleaning it and picking up glasses and plates. The sandbags are there for a reason but they aren't in the way. The Maya and Azteca have a great beach compared to other resorts close by. ENTERTAINEMENT/EVENTS: This resort has alot to offer in terms of events and entertainement. They have a trapeze for free (kids in morning and adults late afternoon). They have bow and arrow targets, kids club, pingpong tables, poolside activities. I did the stretching exercises and got a quick message after :) The Spa also provided people to opportunity to sign up for a free 5 min message which felt awesome. I unfortunately did not make it to the night shows but was told they are pretty good. They also get kids from the resort to participate in the Disney show and practice their part all day for the night show. They asked my daughter to be the princess but she was too shy. CONCLUSION: I would recommend this resort for it's location and service. I also stayed at the Barcelo Maya Beach in Mexico which is a 4 and half star resort and I would go back to the Maya anyday.", "Date": "February 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "bc", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Viva Wyndham Maya\u201d", "Author": "cheeko38", "ReviewID": "UR24327419", "Content": "My husband & I had a fabulous time all in all.

I reported our phone not working and a staff person arrived within 15 minutes to repair it. The buffet was good each day with many different things to choose from. The first few days we ate lunch from the buffet set up by the pool but this had limited variety and ran out of french fries constantly. It's worth walking up to the main building to grab lunch at the buffet set up for breakfast and dinner also. The Mediterranean and Mexican restaurants were great. Especially the mango margaritas they serve prior to your meal at the Mexican restaurant. The pool was impecably crystal clear. Much cleaner than many of the other resorts we have stayed. Staff were friendly and pleasant. The management seems very committed to making your stay enjoyable. Beach was clean and beautiful. Many past reviewers complained about the man-made san barriers placed in the ocean off the beach but they provided resting spots for birds and pelicans to observe while sunbathing by the ocean. We've stayed at Iberostars and Rui hotels in the past. Although the hotel rooms and lobby was not a posh as those, the food and service were equal. We enjoyed our stay for the price we paid.

The hotel is located 5 minutes from 5th avenue and close to all restaurants and nightly entertainment. Rooms- The rooms are a little outdated. But they serve the purpose. To sleep! People who complain about the rooms not being nice enough need to spend more time outside of their rooms and more time enjoying their vacation. We stayed in building 3. Away from the main pool by the tennis courts. The hotel staff works very hard to keep the rooms very clean. I spoke to the maid the first day and asked her for extra bottled water and towels and she complied. Leaving her a tip everyday ensured that those requests were met all week long. Food - I loved the food at this resort. There was never a shortage. They had food to accomadate everyone. They had meat, pastas, veggies and even a diet section. I must say my favorite food is the fresh guacamole. The waiters worked very hard to ensure that your plates are cleared in front of you when you're done eating and that you always have a drink in front of you. A special thanks to Julio Cesaer who ensured that our morning coffee's were in front of us within minutes of taking our seats and they were served the way we liked. Again the tips we left daily ensured our great service even more. There is also a 24 hour snack bar that helps when getting in on those late nights. Drinks - Plenty of them all around. They do not water them down. In fact they are not cheap about it at all. They even have premium alcohol available at no extra charge unlike other hotels that charge an extra premium. Grounds - They were always kept clean and the staff were constantly washing floors and cleaning to keep up the appearance of the hotel. Entertainment - The shows at night were average. Nothing to brag about, but you did see the animation team practicing on a daily basis to try to make it as memorable as possible. The funniest are always the audience participation ones. The sailing staff were also very friendly. A shout out to Oso (Oscar) and Miguel who made are stay enjoyable and entertained us with their stories. We went to town one night and did some shopping and went to Carlos and Charlie's for dinner. Great service and atmosphere always at Carlos & Charlie's. It is very safe to walk around. Guests - There are many Europeans at this resort. Specifically Italians. This is because Viva is an Italian owned company. There are a few topless European women around for anyone that cares about that. Weather - The weather the week I was there was colder than I have experienced in Mexico. The sun set early and it became windy every afternoon. It was also cloudy everyday but one. The nights were always chilly. The beach at this hotel is the nicest of all the other hotels in Playacar. Yes there are a few sandbags, but they serve as a great tanning spot. Overall I had a fantastic trip and was satisfied with the hotel.

From the moment we arrived 7 hours late at 1am (Sunwing's problem, not Viva's) we had excellent treatment. The first thing we did was dump our luggage in our rooms after a speedy check-in. We were all hungry so we headed to the Snack Bar/Pool Bar which is open 24 hours. The food was plentiful, hot and delicious! The drinks were great, the kids all loved the virgin pina coladas. We had a massive room in the new section. This room was so large that even with 4 people in it we were not tripping over each other or our stuff. All 4 of us could be at the double sinks without elbows touching. It was about a 3 minute walk to the lobby and a 5 minute walk to the beach, so it was still close. Apparently the old rooms which are right by the beach are not quite as big and nice from what we heard though. The buffet restaurant had massive selections for every meal. We would come back to the table and ask each other where certain foods were as we had full plates and had bypassed certain areas. The a la carte restaurants we visited were Don Diego (Mexican) and Portofino (Mediterranian). Both places had awesome food presentation and taste. The portion sizes were huge, I had trouble finishing my meals. The only suggestion I would make is to not take younger children, as the meals might not suit them. The advantage was also that the reservation desk for a la carte was from 8am to 2pm, so you didn't have to stand in line at the crack of dawn to book. We felt so secure at this resort that we had no problem letting our children roam at will anytime they wanted. We also had no problem putting them to bed and then continuing with our adult nightlife within the resort (we did have two 13 yr olds to supervise the younger ones). The staff were awesome, especially the entertainment staff!!! They were always around to suggest activities, but never pushy. They would also take the time to sit and visit with you and give you some advise as to any excursions you may want to take. Our children made friends with several of the staff and were always treated wonderfully (as well as us adults). The evening shows were amazing, with several nights of audience participation. The same entertainment staff that would be doing archery with you at 9am, dance lessons at 11am and bocce ball at 4pm would put on these spectacular shows. The costuming and props were superb, and the announcer would flow through as many languages as needed. As for the beach, it was great. Yes, there are giagantic sandbags to protect it, but they are disguised as reefs. Some of these massive sandbags already have coral and vegetation growing on them, so in a few more years people will have a hard time seeing what they really are. The important thing is that these sandbags also make the swimming area safer and prevent beach erosion. There were even fish right in our \"lagoon\" so you could snorkel right there. Chairs were not such a premium as other people have stated, you just had to look around for some and could move them to where ever you wanted them. We always found at least four (for the adults), the children were too busy doing things to just sit on the beach. The locals would also show up daily on the beach with exotic animals to have your picture taken with (macaws, monkeys, iguanas) along with professional looking beach shots. These pictures were available for review every night, so if you missed them one night you could go back another. The little shopping plaza was right out front of the hotel, so that if you wanted souvenirs without traveling, you could just walk there. We even wandered over there a few times with drinks in hand. The bars had every kind of liquor you could possibly want and would serve you anything you asked for. Our children loved trying all of the tropical drinks without alcohol.

Our kids did it several times and loved it. Only 1 complaint ... the house wines, both red and white, were pretty \"rough\".

Was fairly easy to find a palapa most days without reserving, but jammed close together. Pool was good, lots of activities, staff was excellent.

Buffet was good but like a previous write up said long lines ups for single cooks, however there is plenty of other stuff that you dont have to line up to get. Overall a good resort for the money but they did screw us eventualy. Bought tours through the hotel, the credit card got held for suspicious activity wich they said is normal and to just call the credit card company. I know about the charges for phones and asked the front desk how i could make a call without incurring exorbatent charges. They said use the room and gave us a code to us(it iwas a collect call) they repeated there would be no charge, when we checked out no signing, no mention of call etc. however got home and they had stiffed us for 108 dollers for a collect call. For that I will never set foot in a viva whyndam again. However for the rest of you, it was a fairly good deal for the money. For the issue of 108 dollers they have lost a lot of our business though, and if the general manager really reads these contact us and make it right and maybe some business from our large extended family will come back, highly unlikely as you only seem to comment on positive experiences", "Date": "January 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norton, Vermont", "Title": "\u201cReturn to the Viva Maya\u201d", "Author": "nne1dxd", "ReviewID": "UR23861287", "Content": "We have been to this resort 9 times, but not for about 6 years. We were nervous, as we heard the beaches had changed due to mother nature, so here are the facts. Yes the beach has changed. There are large black sand bags about the size of a large whale everywhere to hold the sand back. It definately takes away from the carribean charm, but we understand the need. The beach is noticeably smaller, and the width changes with every resort due to bags and erosion. A casual walk along the beach can be difficult, maneuvering the bags and the \"shelves\". You can't walk the beach past the Riu to Playa Del Carmen without climbing over concrete slabs and bags as the beach, at one point is non existent. These bags, combined with the wind and heavy surf, create an undertow which can be very strong. There were several rescues the week we were there as some bathers ingnored life guard warnings to stay close. It is safe, but listen to what the guards post for conditions. Don't get discouraged, it is still a very beautiful beach, but not what it was years ago. The other beach issue, the Maya added one building with an additional 150 rooms, so, less beach, more people. There used to be 350 rooms, now there are 500. One rainy day, I counted approx 720 chairs on the beach. They are lined up in rows, very close to one another, so any privacy on the beach is now non existent. See Pics attached. They did however, add more pallapas, and finding one is usually not a problem, as well as a chair. The beach is kept immaculate, as they are cleaning it non stop. Special thanks to \"Jesus\" who works very hard cleaning the beach. Ok, enough of the beach, now the food. The buffet, in our opinon, is good. If you want the specialty restaurants, book very early. We ate at the buffets nightly and enjoyed each meal. There are different themes, with a different roast nightly. The most popular is the pasta bar, with fresh cooked to order pastas and sauces. This is popular, and excellent, but their is only one person cooking for all those people so be prepared to wait in line. Plenty of desserts and breads as well. Dress is very casual here, shorts are fine. Breakfasts are also excellent. I think you can find anything you want there, but once again, the omelet bar, cooked to order, but only one person cooking them. Lunch, we ate at the pool bar snack area daily. Once again, more people same buffet size. The fries are excellent, but usually empty and you will wait, same as the nacho chips, they cook them fresh, but they do not keep the nacho machine plugged in so they get cold quickly. Pizza is good but again, you will wait. I would stay away from the burgers, as they are precooked and stored in a liquid, then grilled for a short time. The hot dogs are undercooked so ask them to grill one for you. Excellent food, but the lunch pool buffet needs imrpovements. The bars, their are basically 2 that we used, a large pool bar, which is well staffed and you will not wait long for a cold Dos Equis, or your favorite drink. Their is also a lobby bar, which is usually crowded and if you can find a seat is a good bet for a late afternoon drink or a late night visit. There is also an added \"quiet\" bar and pool near the new addition, no children or noise allowed, but we never went their. The rooms, large, clean and adequate. The air conditioners work well but very loud so bring earplugs for sleep. The maids are excellent so tip them well. My only room issue, only 2 shelves for all your clothes. They need bureaus or something. You also have some hanging space, but you will live out of your suitcase a bit.. The staff, excellent, everyone friendly and helpful. The shows, we never went, but heard they were ok, but start late 9:45 p.m. We spent a lot of time in Playa Del carmen in the past but were anxious to see how that has progressed. What a dissappointment. The first time we went their years ago.. dirt roads, local people trying to make a living, now, fifth ave looks like New York City. Glass front air conditioned stores one after another, basically with the same stuff in each. Many jewelry stores, restaurants etc.. you can walk forever, but very modernized. Even has a WalMart??? I miss the charm of Old mexico. No bargains either, but if you like people watching, take a 5 dollar cab ride and check it out... Overall, we had a good time, the beach should not deter your decision, and, for the money, we would definately go back again..We paid about 850 each, American, including air, transfers etc... which seemed to be the average rate for 7 nights and 8 days from Boston..

And since it rained a lot they were very slippery for my husband who had to push me. Ramps were sealed concrete \u2013 very slippery and the sidewalks and driveways are paving stones \u2013 very bumpy. If you had an electric scooter or wheelchair I think it would be fine. The taxi drivers were really good about driving us around with the wheelchair. Playa del Carmen is an OK excursion; the roads are paving stones so it is constantly bumpy. My husband had to hike me up a stair or three to get into shops. Many shops not accessible \u2013 narrow isles. An electric scooter here would be fine for `cruising the strip` but too hard to lift into the shops \u2013 manual chair is need here. The flight: We flew AreoMexico \u2013 good flight, on time, friendly The transfer: Was good. However since we had to wait for others flights and the line up through customs \u2013 we were in the parking lot for about an hour and a half. We boarded the bus at 9:07 and did not leave the parking lot until 11:00. We did not get to the hotel until 12:30 - since the bus stopped at other resorts before ours. Knowing what we do now \u2013 we would have taken a cab for 45.00 US. The bus was air conditioned and clean. The check in and the reception: Quick check-in and staff was polite. The room: We were expecting a wheelchair accessible room with a king bed, ocean view with fridge. We entered the room and got a wheelchair accessible room with roll in shower; no king size bed, no fridge and no view. When we went back to the desk to ask for our room, they stated they do not have any rooms with king beds \u2013 and if we wanted an ocean view we had to pay $40.00 per night extra. We decided not to bother. But they did try. But as I read on an earlier post, they do have king bed rooms on the third floor. We were told all there rooms only have queen bed, but they are really doubles. The rooms do not have alarm clocks \u2013 bring your own. The rooms did have dehumidifiers in them, which were great, and an air conditioner \u2013 which was loud, but worked well. The housekeeping staff would turn both of them off after cleaning the rooms, so after coming back from the pool or tours we came back to a humid and hot room. We left a tip on the bed every morning, but only received towel designs two of the five days we were there. For the d\u00e9cor, double bed very hard, on a concrete platform. Headboard is wood and moulding on the wall - painted heavily in layers. Room colours were orange, yellow and royal blue with a large parrot painting on the wall. I found the room to be quite gloomy, dated and tacky. No frills. There was a TV in the room, no satellite, and only two or three English channels to view \u2013 needed it especially when it was raining. The noise from the halls woke us up many times in the early hours \u2013 very loud and echoed, due to the tile floors and intoxicated people yelling. In room safe was nice. The pool / beach: We appreciated the close proximity to the beach and the pool area- beach is just feet from the pool. There is a life guard on the beach, and they have warning flags every day to tell you about the water conditions. There are numerous shade huts on the beach and around the pool. Even thought you are not to HOLD your seat \u2013 many placed towels on them to save them but were never around. You will be given towel cards when you check in \u2013 you exchange them for towels. You can turn your towels in for the cards or for clean towels. If you lose your cards or towels \u2013 you have to pay $20.00 US for new cards. The main pool area is were all the action is, if you want a more relaxing ``no kids ``experience go to the adult pool. However, no towel exchange here, and no wheelchair accessible banos (washrooms), so I had to be at the main pool. I found it a bit annoying, as parents did not supervise their children \u2013 to my liking, as we had to ask the children to stop splashing and throwing water. But again, since I was in a wheelchair, I was limited to where I could go. The entertainment: Good evening entertainment, even though your rooms are close the entertainment at night did not disturb you - due to the lush grounds \u2013 the sound and the wind are blocked. There are different activities during the day: Free lessons - Spanish, dance lessons, yoga, water and land aerobics, basketball, fooseball, crafts, sailing, tennis, windsurfing, trapeze gymnastics, volleyball, bingo. Evening shows - different one every night, they are definitely cheesy as they do a lip-synching but they do put in a very nice dance show. ** On Tuesday\u2019s a guy sets up a table near the lobby bar and `finger paints`` on tile, you have to see it - he is great. Get there early \u2013 he sells out fast and his orders pile up \u2013 nice 8X10 tile pictures for 10.00 US. This resort did not communicate or promote these events or activities \u2013 unless you are right there when it is happening \u2013 then you really don\u2019t need to hear the announcement. The food - good (4): Food was edible; but was very bland and unappealing at breakfast and lunch. Dinners were a bit better \u2013 a bit more variety. Only one meal at the buffet in our 7 days served guacamole \u2013 I thought I was in Mexico. The buffet did have label cards to tell you about the food, but they were often above the wrong dishes or not there at all. For someone with allergies - this was confusing. And when asking for assistance from the cooks \u2013 they were friendly but could not answer my questions. The a la cartes were okay. The Mexican restaurant was the best for atmosphere and food. Portifino (Italian) great service, but food was ok and often served cold. Mexican restaurant \u2013 you have to try the chilli soup, and the calamari and shrimp dish- very good and fresh. Ask for Gabriel \u2013 he is the best waiter!! Portifino \u2013 try the tomato basil soup, and the fruit mousse!!!! The other restaurant; Mediterranean, I could not access since there were only stairs to get to it (wheelchair) and no elevator. However the food was prepare at the beach buffet kitchen and brought up. They never told us about theme nights, again they never communicated these events very well. Did go to the Azteca for their Italian a la cart \u2013 better at Portifino \u2013 almost identical menu. Not worth the taxi ride or the walk. The poolside buffet was not appetizing for a number of reasons \u2013 open air and accessible to birds and bugs, people left trays open so it cooled off quickly, and people would just walk by and stick their hands in the nacho and fry bins and serve themselves \u2013 not hygienic. Also the favourite items were emptied quickly and the food staff did not keep on top of this and were left empty for long periods of time. The pizza from the wood stove oven was great!!! It was the best thing we ate all week. However, I did notice they serve guacamole at this buffet on a number of occasions. This resort is only a 5 min cab ride - $5.00 US \u2013 to Playa del Carmen \u2013 nice escape. \u2013 Loved the location. Loved the fact that the timeshare sellers did not approach us once \u2013 that was nice. I felt very secure and safe on this resort \u2013 any time you left you had to give your room number, taxi driver had to give gate staff their driver\u2019s card and was given it back when they left. Even walking onto the resort you had to show your wristband. We did check out other resorts on walks \u2013 I do have to say that the grounds at the Viva are gorgeous and were not duplicated on other resorts.

We took our time to find a place that had terrific weather since we are from Alberta. We even joined the Wyndham club and recieved special cards that would aloow us some small way in to collect points and maybe get a few small special things while there. Like the rooms that we picked! When we arrived the fellow at the check in desk was miserable. We had asked for rooms close to the pool, close together and on the 2nd floor. We got mainfloor rooms that had air conditioner exhaust blowing at us as soon as we went on to the patio. Also, when we would be on the patio every one walking on the paths could see us as we were about 20 foot from the path. This fellow at the check in said the we had to take these rooms because they were full. Once we checked the rooms we went back to the check in and talked with a younf lady at the counter. She had no problems in changung our rooms. Once in the new rooms we found the the air conditioner was extermely noisy, somewhat like the jet we just got off. The controls did not work for low and high and some filters were sitting on top of the air conditioner. The balcony screen door would not close properly and the bathroom door latch and striker plate were falling off because the screws were stripped. This was because the door was crooked and it actually hit the door jam. The Wyndham card was not any value at all. We were to have red wine waiting in our room, but of course this was not the case. The pool snack bar was usually out of fries, nachos and pizza. By the salad area I noticed ants. Most of the other food was not very good but the children did like the pasta. Carlos at the pool bar was very moody. Often he would refuse to make miami vice drinks while other bar tenders would. He even gave us crap for not standing in line and then he would make it difficult for us to get a drink. The weather was very very nice. Sun went down early but it came up early so we made the best of it. We got some great tans! The kids loved it and we loved the weather. The water was ok and the large sand bags were a bit unslightly but they were ok. The Portofino was terrific. The food well prepared and the service was also great. The evening shows were good and our children were in the amateur show one evening and had a great time.

We arrived on New Year's Eve in the afternoon. Our hotel rooms were not ready, but we had a pleasant greeting and went to the beach and checkout other parts of the resort. By 3 pm, our rooms were available, they were near each other however, I was able to change one to a better location without any difficulty. New Year's Eve had a fantastic band, and a fabulous dessert buffet which we oggled over and took photos. It took a few days to get into the restaurants, which was fine with us because it allowed us to eat at the buffet for a few days and when we were tired of it, we had the restaurant bookings. We enjoyed Portofino the best. Best of all, was the Viva Circus!! We were there everyday at 9 in the morning ready to trapeze and learn new moves. Safety wasn't a concern - as Billy runs the circus team smoothly with obvious experience and control. Billy, Paul, Guillaume, Joey and Chucho were the lead instructors that made us feel comfortable and confident in our selves to try more difficult manoeuvres. They all had a great sense of humour which was especially important at the beginning. Special thanks from Maya, Jordana, Ben, and Max. We found the staff to be very hard working and the people in the show seemed to be busy all day long encouraging the guests to get involved in various activities. Learning the merengue, doing the step class, water aerobics, stretch class, crazy games and water polo were the ones that we participated in, and we had a blast! We took a catamaran lesson with Oscar, he's just wonderful and has great stories. Meliza was the leader of the Teen's Club, and is a great person for involving this age group. They played volleyball, soccer, had boogie board races, archery tournaments, and during quieter times, got the group of teens to meet and socialize in the courtyard which was an awesome setting. The shows were great, and entertaining, just a bit long winded at times. None the less, we watched all of them, and were happy to do so. The main buffet, La Terazza had decent food. We didn't find it too repetitive as some days we had a large breakfast, and just fruit for lunch and other days we had a small breakfast and a large lunch. Gabriel and all of the staff were very friendly and efficient. Our only complaints revolve around cigars on the beach and one night a woman was smoking during the show right in front of us. Also, we would have liked some drawers or ledges in the room to put clothes on so we weren't always pulling out our suitcases. We thought the beach was awesome, clean and quite large, and spent every sunrise and most mornings baking in the sun.", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cgood things bad things\u201d", "Author": "perfectrx2", "ReviewID": "UR23460103", "Content": "I travel usually at least twice a year and i have to say this resort has the most activities(especially i loved Trapeze-Circus) they have great enterntaiment team and a great variety of activities thru the day(some like circus training,archery and wall climbing can not be found at any other resort).Room was good BUT no closets.

The hotel grounds and buildings are pleasant and well maintained, contrary to some reviews here. The overall area is not huge, so it's a quick walk from the beach to buffet, lobby, etc. I was pleasantly surprised. Architecture is cozy and charming. However the hotel website is misleading, and the overall experience was quite limiting. Let me explain: The beach: Contrary to reviews here and pictures on the hotel website, the beach is eroded and huge bags of sand are layed-out in the water in order to stabilize whatever is left. However the ambiance is that you feel surrounded by dirty beached dead whales. I had read reviews that said this beach was better at the Viva compared to the other hotels around and it\u2019s false. The Red flag (no swimming/sports) was always out even though the weather was nice. I guess that way nobody's responsible, and catamaran and kayaks were unavailable for 6 of the 7 days there. But wait! Motor sports (sea doo and some para-sailing) were operational. Why? Probably because those are not free, and generate revenue. As you enjoy the sun on the small beach, crowded, and if you manage to find a beach chair, you will be regularly reminded that you are in a low cost establishment by the diesel smell from the water sports, which, curiously seem to particularly like this hotel and not the neighboring ones... The boats puling the parachutes throw tons of diesel fumes as they are trying to cope with the strong pull of the parachute. So after 1hr of diesel & sun, you retire. Room: Room was clean, a bit outdated, washroom was nice and looked like new! But the air conditioning was super loud! Combine this with the constant traffic of hotel/bar supplies on the path in front of our window and there is no way you will get an afternoon nap, without thunder- like noise from the plastic bins on wheels passing every few minutes. Should you decide to not use the A/C you will be disturbed by Hotel Security people talking loudly at night (2 am), even after we asked them to keep a bit quieter or not insist of talking inside the building entrance. Guess the noisy A/C is a must as it hides the rest of the hotel noise. As per hotel website the room did NOT INCLUDE: Alarm clock, TV picture was terrible, Coffee/Tea maker, Cordless phone, Desk chair, Desk lamp, Internet or High-Speed Internet, Movies, Radio, WebTV (list from website). What bothered us is the lack of a clock, noisy A/C, noisy staff (guards), noisy supply carts/bins and the lack of internet (as advertised). Wi-Fi was supposed to be available in the lobby, however the official response on that one is that it was just discontinued before our arrival, even though the technician of the rental computer room claimed the Wi-Fi was working. Why would the hotel discontinue the Wi-Fi? Who knows\u2026 I needed to stay in touch and had chosen the hotel based on the fact Internet was available. The only consolation was the very charming staff members that were particularly trained to dissipate complaints Buffet: Mediocre Cuban 3 star quality buffet. (You can get better in Cuba). Both of us had digestion problems also. Very limited selection, given 400 rooms\u2026 However the breakfast was good, and on occasion there were one or two dishes one could get by with. I\u2019m not picky just that I expected a bit better in Mexico. A la carte restaurants: We went on xmas eve and they apparently had a 'special menu' (to celebate?). It was so bad that we never returned to any of the restaurants. The food were terrible, and I\u2019m not picky + served cold. Service was courteous but very slow. Staff was mixed up in their orders, even though every single client had the same dishes that night. This is not surprising; I rarely find hotel a la carte restaurants to be worth the time. Buffets are usually better. Staff: Courteous. Excellent service everywhere. The problems with this establishment are from management and not the local staff. Simply put it\u2019s a relatively low cost place so expect it as such. My only problem is in the fact that the website is misleading and so were many reviews at tripadvisor.com Special mention: We booked through Sunwing. The flight and on flight service and food were excellent and a great surprise. However there was a major glitch. I asked the Sunwing rep. how long the bus ride from the airport to the hotel was going to be. She responded 1 hr. Problem is that it took 2hrs. The reason I had asked was to evaluate if I should take a cab ride (40 minutes). I arrived tired and pissed that I was stuck in a bus for 2 hrs, when in fact the ride would have been 40 min in a cab. I guess the bus company would have lost money if I hadn\u2019t taken their bus, and hence the \u20181 hr lie\u2019. Bottom line: Inexpensive hotel great for families with teenagers (there were lots). Is seems there are tons of activities for the young every day/night. However if you are looking for a nice beach, swimming, water sports, ok food, internet, alarm clock in the room, look elsewhere. Windham: Please update the website and be honest. I also assumed that since a Wyndham rep seems to read the reviews here and respond, I also thought that Wyndham is listening to their clients. Wrong. Wyndham has a smart \u2018appear as we care\u2019 policy as per these responses and the excellent charming lobby staff.", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cHave To Agree \"Not Worth IT!!!!\"\u201d", "Author": "Kbars", "ReviewID": "UR23381016", "Content": "My wife, grown daughter and I returned from our stay between Christmas to New Years (Dec 26th to Jan 1st) at this resort. First let me say I have been going to Cancun/Cozumel for 10 years (we dive with Nautilus see their reveiws EXCELLENT!) and have stayed at 3 to 5 star resorts. We wanted to stay someplace different and this is why we chose this resort in Playa. We did not enjoy our trip and here is why. The resort is older (this is not the problem). It is located in a nice secure part of Playa (which is good). Like others have said it takes a long time to get there due to all the stops along the way. I new this so I am not complaining just letting others know so they will be aware. The resort while older is well kept especially the grounds. The rooms are old and could use updating, however they are clean. The air conditioners are loud and when you would come in from outside the floors would become wet with condensation and stay that way because the A/C could not keep up. We did have a fridge and the maid would sometimes refill it with a few sodas nor did they bring clean wash cloths daily (very inconsistent). There is no clock or coffe pot in the room (major disapointment). I have a disability that I use a wheelchair (brought my own). The facility is accessible but the sidewalks throughout the resort have areas that are on a steep grade. The worst are the three ramps that go up to the buffet. I weight 150 lbs and my wife is a strong 140 lbs and can push me anywhere but the visit to the buffet really wore her out. Which brings me to the food. The main buffet is the La Terraza and it is not that good (other than breakfast), and yes they do hide the bacon (behind the grill!!) so you have to ask for it. I agree with another poster I have never been to Cancun and stayed anywhere that did not serve Guacomole, Salsa and chips, come on this is Mexico did they have an avocado disaster? The specialty restaurants. We arrived on Friday evening so we ate at the buffet. Was told to be at the front desk by 8 am each morning to sign up for reservations for the specialty restaurants. My daughter and I dive so we were gone. My wife was there in line by 7:30 am (4th in line). When she got to speak to the girl taking reservations was told everything is booked for that nite (Sat). We get back from diving around 1 pm so I went to the desk and ask if there had been any cancellations or to see if i could book for later in our stay. I am told that everything is booked at all the specialty restaurants until after New Years. This upset me to say the least. Here I have just arrived and they are telling me I cannot get a reservation during my entire stay. If any of you have been to an AI resort you know they only reserve about half the seats in the specialty restaurants anyway because they don't want to have spend the money to feed so many people every night. Well I got more than a little upset and she gave me a reservation at their sister resort down the street at \"Xul-Ha\" an authentic Mayan restaurant which we enjoyed. They told me to come back the next day that morning which I did and there was a guy taking reservations and I was able to get one for the next couple of nights at the \"Portifino\" - Mediteranean (food not very good but service was good) and \"Hacienda Don Diego\" _ Mexican (which was pretty good). Overall I blame the resort and staff for making it difficult to get to eat at the specialty residents. The pool snack bar is just plain awfull and there was nothing we would consider eating from it. The bars and drinks are good. They do not skimp on the liqour. However one of our biggest complaints is you can't get a cup of coffee in the morning without getting it from the lobby bar (which is only expresso) which is OK if you are used to drinking it that way. My wife went to the buffet each morning to get me a cup of regular coffee to bring back to me in the room (remember I use a wheelchair and the ramp). She was told she could not leave with coffe from the buffet. Also remember they do not have coffe pots in rooms. So this was a major area of concern with us. Also the workers at the resort do not speak english as well as workers at other resorts I have stayed. The beach is so so and the pools are OK with the problem listed by others that they allow people to go down and put their towels on chairs who do not use them all day (UNFAIR!!!). Go into the town of Playa this is a lot of fun as others have stated. As some others on here have said if you are just going for a place to sleep so you can enjoy the nice weather then this resort will do.

What made the trip so enjoyable was being able to interact with the staff/entertainers and especially the trapeze artists at Viva Circus (Havic Circus). Would you believe that you can try the flying trapeze with their expert help and if you hang from your knees properly and arch your back just right you may be deemed \u201ccatchable\u201d and qualify to have Chucho catch you on his trapeze? My sons and I all dared to try the trapeze and two performed the catch. I was downright scared to the point of having shaky legs and a pounding heart, but once on the platform, Joey was so calming and encouraging that I was able to take the leap 4 times. My 11 year old was so thrilled when he made the catch and was able to do the return back to his own trapeze. It was also great fun watching the other guests try more challenging stunts as they got better with practice. Hats off to Chucho, Paul, Guillaume, Joey, Billy and the rest of his talented performers. The Viva Circus performers also did a show one of the nights that was amazing. Paul dazzled us with his Cyr wheel, Guillaume with his incredible strength and grace on the low trapeze, and Chucho flying blindfolded on the high trapeze to an amazing catch by Billy. Another favorite activity was taking the Skycycle canopy tour, flying on wet and dry zip lines and snorkeling in the cenotes at Hidden Worlds, less than an hour\u2019s drive from Viva Wyndham Maya. The Ultimate Adventure package kept us busy for 6+ hours. On our way back to the resort, we had a nice authentic Mexican meal at La Buena Vida in Akumal. The resort had a few issues, but not enough to spoil our fun. Food at the buffet was mediocre, but the servers were excellent - especially Gabriel. Our group of eight was unable to get a reservation at either of the restaurants except on New Year's Eve - which had a fixed menu. The rooms were comfortable, but not top notch. It was impossible to get a beach chair unless you were an early riser and the topless bathing did not seem appropriate for a family resort.

The restaurant was so romantic and nicely decorated for the holidays. We also ate at Xul-Ha, an authentic Mexican ala carte restaurant at the Azteca. It was delicious. We loved how we were able to walk around outside of the resort in Playacar, something that we are not used to doing considering we frequently visit the Dominican Republic and Antigua: places where it is not the safest idea to leave the resort. We visited Playa del Carmen and it was charming. Lots of shopping and restaurants. The VWM had the best beach in the Playacar area by far. They have made huge efforts to preserve the beach. We walked the beach and most of the other resorts have a small beachfront (including the AAA 5 Diamond Royal Hideaway, which had no beach!). There were tons of watersports and activities available. Beach volleyball games were always going on. The pool was great. So much action going on (games, waterpolo, pool bar with great drinks) and the water was so refreshing. The best part was the entertainment team. They were really great and were so eager to please the guests. Their energy was contagious; I give them a huge round of applause for all their hard work. My one quam: I've always read reviews on here about people reserving lounge chairs all day, but I never experienced it. I did on this trip. There were chairs reserved from 7am and left unattended all day. We never got a lounge chair until after 3pm and wound up having to lay our towels on the sand every day. It was fine, as we are not fussy, but it is annoying to see how people can be so inconsiderate. I don't blame the hotel; I blame the guests. This act is extremely rude and I think the hotel needs to really work on freeing up unattended chairs. Overall, this was a great vacation.

Great big sand bags and rough water made it hard to swim, no snorkeling off the beach. Trips - we went to Cozumel a couple of times found it very much the same as Playa.

Our booking was done directly on the Wyndham website, and also signed up for By Request, their free frequent guest program. (We each had our own rooms, so I will leave it to them to write their own review :) We arrived at the resort around 9:30 pm, and checkin was fast and friendly - we were brought a welcome drink (ahh, Pina Colada!) and lead down the covered pathway by the bellman. Room: We were assigned room 2109. We had a large room with a King sized bed, a little sitting area with a small table and chairs, a dresser with drawers and a closest with hangers and shelves. The room was on the ground level, with a view of the pool and beach, and there were big sliding doors that lead outside to a patio. We could literally walk out of our room, across a small patch of grass, onto the beach!! Our mini fridge was stocked with bottled water, juices, pop, beer and even champagne. We had no problems with refills on the water and beer. A couple of small issues - the shower and safe were both broken... the safe wasn't a huge deal, as my sister's room was next door to ours and had a much bigger, more \"sophisticated\" looking safe, so we just shared hers... We didn't discover the shower until the following day, and advised the front desk that afternoon. It was fixed within an hour of us reporting the problem. And yes, the room smelled a bit musty, but really... we're in Mexico... it's humid. It wasn't a big deal for us. Food: \"La Terazza\" Buffet - Tons of food to choose from for any meal. Breakfast - fresh fruit, yogurt, granola and cereals, breads and cheeses, french toast, pancakes (really good pancakes!), sausage, scrambled eggs, potatoes. They have a make your own omlette station, and made to order eggs station - where they also hide the bacon!! haha Just ask, there was only 1 day when it was all gone... Lunch/Supper - fresh pizza, burgers and fries, as well as varied chicken, fish, beef and pork items. Several different pastas, rice and potatoes and choices of salads, bread, etc A la Carte Restaurants - On our 1st morning there, we went to the lobby area to make our a la carte restaurant reservations. It wasn't busy, only 3 or 4 other people in the line. We were able to get reservations for all 4 of us at each of the 3 restaurants. \"Hacienda Don Diego\" - Mexican \"Portofino\" - Mediterranean \"Miramare\" - Italian At each of the a la carte restaurants, there is a small set menu, where you select a starter (soup or salad generally), a main course and a dessert. We found the food to be great at all of the restaurants, flavourful and nicely presented. The servers are wonderful, always smiling, offering to take pictures of you and answered any questions. There is also a snack bar down by the pool... seems that they generally take the leftovers from lunch/dinner down to the snack bar, but everything is still well heated or chilled and they do make fresh pizza in a wood fired oven, and have nachos, hotdogs, hamburgers, etc. Drinks: I've read in past reviews and on many forum posts about \"watered down\" drinks at resorts... I can assure you this is not the case at this resort!!! Drinks are strong and of course, unlimited. Lots of fun tropical drinks to choose from and they make anything else you can think of as well... they have brand name liquor such as Skyy, Johnnie Walker, Malibu, etc... They also made great fresh coffee and cappuccinos... Beach: The Viva Maya has a GREAT beach... beautiful white sand, turquoise blue water, you can see Cozumel in the distance. We didn't have much of an issue getting chairs together... the 1st day we had to drag 4 together, but we only got to the beach around 11am... Yes, there are people that put down their towels at the crack of dawn to save \"the best spot\", but for me any spot on the beach in Mexico is just fine!! They have the \"whale\" sand bags to help with erosion, but they actually blend in, and it makes the ocean a bit calmer, and there are lots of fish that hang out by them, so makes for good snorkelling. You can sign out wind surfers, kayaks and snorkels for free as well. Pools: There is a main pool, located near the beach with a swim up bar, and a kiddie section. Then there is another pool on the other side of the resort, which is adult only. The pools aren't heated, so they were a bit chilly at times, but we spent most of our time at the beach. Entertainment: There is no shortage of things to do at this resort. The \"animation team\" are always trying to get you involved, as they have many activities from stretching/yoga to step class to beach volleyball to dance lessons. They are very polite and if you say no, they leave you alone. They work very hard, as the same people that try to get people involved during the day are the ones that do the nightly shows, and then try to get you into the disco when it opens at 11pm!! Not sure if it's because it opens so late, but the disco doesn't seem to be very busy... they play mostly \"techno\" or european dance music. We managed to stay up that late a few nights (the sun drains you more than you can imagine! haha) but there was never more than 20 people there on the nights we went. If you're looking for a party, there are TONS of bars and great nightlife in town. Grounds/Amenities: We visited the Maya last December as well, and we could see improvements since our last visit. The beach is MUCH larger than last year, with many more palapas, and while we were there they were building new palapas around the pool (quite a painstaking process, very interesting to watch!!) The grounds are very nice, there are always people cleaning the common areas, and looking after the landscaping, and each night they spend hours putting the beach chairs back in their places on the beach and around the pool, so that everything looks \"brand new\" the next morning. There are many animals around... iguanas, cats, and little creatures we lovingly called \"rat dogs\", apparently they're actually called \"Zereques\". There are covered walkways from the rooms to the lobby bar/lounge area, lobby and buffet. Lucky for us, since it rained a couple of days while were there. The resort has an internet room available, with 5 computers. You can purchase 30 mins of time for 25 pesos at the Gift Shop. I saw many people in the lobby/bar area with laptops, so I assume they have wireless as well. There is also a currency exchange booth, a tour desk where you can book excursions and you can get maps, etc at the Guest Services desk (where you also book the a la carte restaurants). Area: It takes approx. 45 mins to an hour to get from the Cancun airport to the resort (since we didn't book as a \"package\", we used a private shuttle company). The resort is located in the Playacar complex, a gated community attached to the town of Playa del Carmen. Both areas feel very safe, and we had no problems walking around, during the day or at night. Taxis have a set rate (depending on where you are going), generally 50 pesos (5 USD) to get into Playa. Walking into town takes about 25-30 mins, and the resort also offers free bicycles that you can take during the day. Be sure to ask for a lock, as there are many places to lock up the bicycle in Playa, so you can explore the town. There is a sidewalk on both sides of the street, one side is for pedestrians, the other for bicycles... (not too many tourists seem to pay attention to this, as we had some people give dirty looks when we bicycled past them on the BICYCLE side of the sidewalk! haha) There is also a little shopping complex across the street from the resort, it has various little shops and vendors, convenience type stores, as well as a Starbucks. Excursions: We took a day trip to Tulum. We didn't book a tour, we just went on our own. We took a cab into Playa, and then took the collectivo (public transportation, 10-12 passenger van) from Playa to Tulum. One way cost is about 25 or 30 pesos. They drop you off on the side of the highway, you cross the road, and walk down a dirt road to the entrance to the ruins. Entrance fee to the ruins is 48 pesos. Tulum is beautiful... ruins, cliffs & a great beach. Glad we didn't go as part of a tour group, as we had time to view the ruins at our pace, we went swimming and layed on the beach, then stopped for lunch at one of the restaurants in the little shopping complex near the highway. We also did an ATV/Zipline/Cenote tour with Discovery Jungle Park. I believe the cost was 700 pesos per person, and we booked with the excursion desk at the resort. The company picks you up at the resort (we did the AM tour, pick up at 745 am) in a 10 passenger van. You go on a short ride to their location in Playa del Carmen. Upon arrival, they suit you up with goggles and a helmet, give you the safety details and get everyone settled on the ATV's. You drive 20 miles (on main roads, dirt roads and then off road) into the jungle. Then take a little walk through the woods to a little thatched hut where they suit you up with the harnesses for ziplining. They provide water and there is a pretty \"rustic\" bathroom... There are 3 ziplines, the 1st you climb a ladder, the 2nd you \"run and jump\" off of a platform, and the last is the highest, they call it the \"Eiffel Tower\".. As a 1st time zipliner, the size and height were great... not TOO scary, but still quite a rush. Once you are done ziplining, you can swim in a cenote. The water is quite cool, but it's refreshing after all the action in the heat. You then get back on the ATV and head back to the \"office\" (where you can purchase pictures they take & souvenirs) and then they drive you back to your resort. We also rented jet-skis (seadoos) on the beach... we \"negotiated\" 35 mins (usually 30) for about 600 pesos ... the boys really wanted to do it, so we agreed to the silly price.. haha Overall: There was one negative thing, but not really the fault of the resort... smokers...everywhere. I assume this is because the resort seems to cater to Europeans, particularly Italians. I'm obviously a non-smoker, and where I live, it's actually illegal to smoke in any public buildings - restaurants, bars, malls, etc. so maybe it's just because I'm used to being in \"non-smoking\" environments, but it seemed that the smokers here were particularly rude... smoking at the snack bar?! The thing that really irritated me was that they would put their butts in the sand on the beach when they were done.. and NOT take them when they left. You are laying on the beach in paradise, and you're throwing your cigarette butts in the sand!! Jheesh! (The resort does come and clean them up from time to time.) Anyway, back to the good! This resort is a great value for money - you have to remember that this is not a 5 star resort, and you're in another country - things are going to be different from home. If you prepare yourself with these facts, you'll have a great time! Remember - You're on vacation - RELAX and enjoy yourself!!", "Date": "December 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hiram, Maine", "Title": "\u201cVacation Club\u201d", "Author": "MaineHiram", "ReviewID": "UR23108110", "Content": "My Husband and I Returned from a week at the Viva May December16th.

We have made friends with many of the bar tenders, they are all very nice and helpful. A little tip here and there makes a big difference to them. We also tip the maid daily, and I get a christmas gift for them each day. Just something little, but they do such a good job making animals from the towels and they always leave everything clean. We have never experienced any problems before. We are Viva Club Member, paid a lot of money for this membership. We had reserved a room that we wanted and have never had a problem before. This year, they lost the reservation, or changed it. When we arrived they had no room available for us. We finally got a room, (not what the Club Membership had promised). It was not a great room. I had to live out of my suit case all week. They kept promising they would move us to the Jr. Suite that we had paid for, but that never happened. This went on for most of the week. We had no help what so ever, it was all empty promises. Beware of the Time Share people.

Let me give you a run down of what I mean by this. Firstly arrived at Cancun airport and went through without a hitch & when we walked outside to locate the agents we booked through one came forward reeled off my husbands bag and when at the bus noted he only makes a little salary so to give him a tip, so we both laughed and noted let the \"fun\" begin, well at least you know you in Mexico and we did not mind as we do know they earn such a little! What we did not know is that other people booked at other hotels were on this bus as well and which had to be dropped off at each one first and of cause Viva Wyndham was the very last stop, go figure. We arrived at 3:40pm in the afternoon and after all the drop off's and waiting we only arrived at Viva Wyndham M after 7:00pm which left us very tired & hungry after flying for 5 hours from Vancouver - Cancun and then travelling in a bus which took a while. Don't expect a fancy entrance like all the other hotels you see as this is not one of them. The entrance of the hotel is very bland. The booking in went without a hitch and we got a superior room on the 3rd floor as we requested as would not have as much noise. The bell boy asked to take our bags but once realized it was on the 3rd floor felt we could handle on our own, but I guess because this is because there is no elevator & this is why he decided to leave us to handle on our own. After walking around for 10min we eventually located and my husband took both bags in hand and carried up to the 3rd floor, thank heavens he \"works out\". I had noted in one of the reviews I read not to ask for an upgrade as all rooms are the same and they were right. The rooms are very old but yet clean, our room had no smell or mold but it did have a noisy air conditioner. We had no problems with water from the shower and they did supply you with a liquid soap dispenser & shampoo dispenser which we never used as brought our own. Fridge was stocked with water only, ahhhh geee, yes that was disappointing but here again this is not a 5 star hotel. We tipped the cleaner every day and of cause she made little animals out of the towels and laid in the middle of our beds, which I thought were cute! Be careful of the beds as the mattresses are actually laid upon a concrete base which I bashed my legs on a few times and still had the bruises when I got home. They are hard but it is good for a bad back, not that we had but they were still comfortable. A tip, make sure you book your restaurants the very next day, early in the morning and if possible before going for breakfast. They will give you receipts for each and which will be asked for when you arrive at each, if you don't have then you don't get in. We managed to book all 3 right away as my husband went to the information session whilst I went to book. The mexican was not the best as raved in other reviews, however everyone's tastes are different. The \"Portofino\" (International)was the best and the Italian was ok. We were served and attended to in a professional manner, however was a little slow with their service and the waiters did not have a chance to be friendly or able to hang around for a chat as I gathered they were been watched by higher authorities. The other was that you felt you were a little rushed as there were other people waiting to fill your seats. This was kind of off putting in a way, no lingering for romantic closeness at any I am afraid but even though service was still good at all and they really tried their best to accommodate. The buffet was great and the food always good, we did not have a problem as so many reviews have stated. Those poor staff members worked so hard and aimed to please and it is so unfortunate as other reviewers have noted that you have people who think they are above these people and treat them horribly and we seen this for ourselves & it is embarrasing to be in the same room as them. Just always remember for you who fall under this catergory that if the shoe were on the other foot....or what goes around comes around. Treat people as you would like to be treated, with dignity, respect, kindness - try and humble yourselves and put yourself in their place, they are working to feed their families! We tipped them without a problem even knowing we already paid for everything. - As for the bars, drinks were good and did not have to ask to make them strong as they just did this anyway, so if you prefer weaker make sure you mention this. We missed the music for atmosphere as did not have in the lobby bar area or down by the pool, the only music you had there was when they were having dancing lessons, which was a disappointment. The disco was a waste of time, as we peeped in each night and no-one showed as the music of cause was high tech. The funny thing is that there was quiet alot of the younger people there, but I guess they decided to go clubbing outside of the hotel instead. They had plenty games during the day and the shows were ok in the evenings, although my husband & I are not show people but other people did enjoy them tremendously. Volley ball was great on the beach and my husband played as much as he could. The weather was the greatest disappointment of all as we had only 2 days of full sunshine and the rest was overcast, windy, which spoiled it on the beach & even had some rain. However the beach & ocean was lovely and were able to go for walks in either direction. Could not walk on the beach in the evenings as was slightly cool & windy so bring along at least one warm item. We did not swim in the pools only in the ocean so it was a pity the weather was not so great & we would definitely pick the right time next time to go to Mexico! Another tip which is a BIG thing to remember, never leave your food unattended while snacking at the pool bar as the birds go nuts and attack the plates and your food is gone within seconds, we witnessed this first hand and the poor person came back for her food only to realize this and was extremely embarrased as everyone was laughing at her. This hotel caters for family's so if you single or a couple and want a fun hotel this is not for you as they have stated in other reviews. My husband and I are a party couple and this was not a party hotel but although the case we still enjoyed it. Another thing that was off putting was the smokers and the lobby bar was always full of them, unfortunately they have to smoke somewhere, although there was alot of open areas I guess this was their vacation and they had the right to smoke anywhere. A must is to go into Playa Del Carmen, we thoroughly enjoyed and people were everywhere!!! The reception or bell boy will arrange a taxi to collect you and to return there are taxi's everywhere. You could walk but would take your a half hour there and back. On our last day when we left, the bus ride to the airport was through a storm, it just poured and remained like that until we flew out. Flight back to Vancouver was 6 hours, walked through customs like a breeze, which never happens, only to find that SunWing had sent my husbands bag to Montreal in error which was fustrating. Another TIP make sure your bags are clearly marked with your address & phone number!!! Although thankfully we did this, it still was sent elsewhere. A few days later another airline which we did not book through called and noted they had our bag! SunWing is a good airline & these things do happen. All in all this hotel is just \"ok\" even though we normally opt for a 5 star hotels but chose this one because of the price. Would we go back again, yes at the same cheap price and when the weather is better than what we had. Remember this is an old hotel and is not a new or modern one so don't expect the best.

Entertainment was great, the \"Grease\" review was fantastic! (the actors lip sync to the actual soundtrack, but they do it so well it is very believable) - I didn't know entertainment was included as well. We had so much fun we only went on two excursions, one to Tulum/zip lines, etc. and one to Xcaret (both great fun). Our friends say Xel-Ha is their favorite. There was a mix of people from around the world, lots of Italians, some from various European countries (only noted one German couple, surprised me I thought they were the biggest travelers), some from Canada and just a few from the U.S. and Mexico. Mostly couples or adult groups, but there always seemed to be about a dozen or so kids around so the kids always had someone to play with. The Kids Club is included and the boys had a great time with that on days they wanted to and we didn't have things planned. Beach was great, water nice and clear, nice sand, lifeguard right there. Be careful, though, the sandbags to prevent beach erosion can be slippery, even the ones on the beach. As per custom, the European women often remove their tops at the beach. But they don't around the pool or the pool bar, etc. and it shouldn't bother anyone but the very conservative. There were lots of beach chairs and you can change your beach towel anytime. Pool was great fun, they have scheduled water polo and water aerobics, etc. The pool bar is the main place to socialize during the day. There are lots of activities from beach volleyball to darts and the hosts and hostesses are very inviting while knowing when not to disturb. Room was nice, some view of the beach, modern and very clean bathroom, very nicely made up beds. The only very minor thing was there was no dresser with drawers, although there were shelves in the closet area and a desk with drawers. TV with several channels was appreciated for the kids (for a few minutes a day, they had so much fun otherwise) and the weather reports. Food was great! Lots of fresh choices, lots of seafood, different items each day, loads of fresh fruits and juices, salads, desserts, Mexican food, chicken, beef, pork, etc. Design your omelette for breakfast.

My husband and I stayed at the Viva Maya from 11/26 to 12/3. We wanted to get away as we are expecting our first child next Spring. This is the second All Inclusive trip we've taken. The first was to the Dominican Republic for our Honeymoon a few years ago. I am very familiary with hotels/resorts as I live in Orlando and have been to / eaten at some of the best. First thing you have to keep in mind when visiting a place like Mexico or certain islands of the Caribbean is that they are not the USA! You are not going to find the same quality of construction and quality of food that we have in the states....so don't expect it! Three star resorts don't hire top notch chefs. The folks who prepare your food are going to be hourly employees, not specially trained chefs. The Maya & Azteca both are located in Plyacar which, in my opinion was the best place to stay between the airport and Tulum. We did a few excursions and stopped at quite a few hotels to pick up other tourists and each time I was glad we were in Plyacar. The Maya is across the street from a shopping center including a Starbucks! We felt very safe walking around and walking up to the Azteca. We didn't go up to 5th Ave. to shop as we're not big shoppers. We had reasonable expectations when we booked our vacation and they were either met or exceeded. Our check-in process was fast and smooth upon arrival. Room: We were there to relax and are not huge partiers (especially considering that I am pregnant) so we requested a room by the adult pool. They gladly placed us there. It did smell a bit musty. However, we had expected this as we had a similar experience in the DR. It is extremely humid there and of course, damp. Despite the musty smell, our room was very clean. The floors were mopped each day and I could tell because places that we had gotten a bit sandy were clean the next day. We had no leaking faucets or clogged toilets. As previous reviews had mentioned, the cakes of soap were small and I had taken my own body wash. However, as soon as the cake of soap was almost gone, a new one was left for us. We never had to ask. Towels were plentiful. There is a sign in the bathroom that clearly says if you want clean towels, leave yours on the floor. If you hang them up, it is a signal to the cleaning staff that you do not want a new one (this is to conserve energy). It also said to feel free to ask if you need more. We never had to ask. Our fridge had two sodas, two juices & two sparkling waters plus two regular waters. I left a note asking form more plain water on our first day. They left me 4 more bottles every day! That is pretty much all I drank, again, since I am pregnant. Food: Again, you can't expect the same quality we're used to in the US. Your best bet is to stick to things that are local to the area as #1 people are used to preparing them and #2 the ingredients are readily available. We ate a TON and never once got sick. We ate at the buffet quite a bit. No, you cannot take food from the buffet back to your room and there are signs posted that clearly indicate this. The place we stayed in the DR had the same rule...it is not just a rule at the Maya. The desserts were not as sweet as we are used to (sugar may not be as readily available?) but we had a few that were really good. The breakfasts were the best! French toast, pancakes, freshly made bread, scrambled eggs, sausage, made to order omelets & eggs etc. All was very good. Lunch / Dinner - They always had pizza, burgers & fries, all of which were good. I ate a lot of fresh fruit. While we were there they had roasted ham, turkey and fish, all of which were good. Some foods were a bit bland such as the pasta sauces. It was kind like they didn't have a lot of spices available. Drinks: Obviously, I didn't drink. The drinks my DH had he said were good. They did have a few non-alcoholic drinks they would prepare for those who wanted (mainly kids) but I tried a few of those and they were good! I recommend the Viva Paradise. Restaurants: You can make reservations for the whole week at one time but we hadn't realized this as the other place we stayed you could only make them for that day. We went down Friday morning to make reservations for that night and when we learned we could make them for the rest of our stay, we did so. We ate at the italian restaurant at the Azteca on Friday night. I had beef and mashed potatoes which were really good. My husband got the chicken parm and it was kind of bland. The service that night was very slow and we ended up leaving before dessert. Sunday night we ate at the Mexican place at the Maya and it was by far the best food we had all week. Very good. Again, we weren't surprised at all that the Mexican food in Mexico was the best. Tuesday night we ate at the Miremar (the one over the pool bar). It was pretty bad. I had ravoli that was supposed to have a sage cream sauce on it but it had no sauce at all. We ended up going to the buffet afterwards. We kind of expected that though so no surprises there. Pools: The pools were not heated and the water was a bit chilly but after all it was the end of November / beginning of December so we didn't expect it to be 100 degrees! Beach: The beach & water were beautiful. Overall, it was one of the nicest beaches around. Yes, you do have to go down early to get a prime spot but you can see the water even from the chairs farthest away so it didn't really matter to us. We always found a seat, even if we didn't go down until late in the morning or afternoon. Excursions: We did the half day Tulum / Xel-Ha trip and had a really good time. I highly recommend it. Xcaret was fun as well. It is a lot like a zoo with tons of animals. Very fun. Internet: I saw some questions about internet connections. They do have WiFi. I heard some people say it was slow. We bought some time on their computers to check e-mail and that was plenty for us. It was worth it to pay $4 USD for 35 minutes online than to worry about lugging my laptop to Mexico. They also had free WiFi at the Starbucks across the street. Overall: If you have reasonable expectations you will not be disappointed. We would consider going back if we were to go to Mexico again. We haven't traveled much so our next vacation will probably be somewhere else simply so we can experience a different country.

The faucets were always leaking, and the toiled in our 3rd room made a terrible noise when you flushed! Food- BARFITRON 4000. When we first arrived at the resort, we had lunch in the buffet. All I had was a pizza... I was barfing with in 30 minutes... The whole week i lived on bread and water. My husband and daughters were sick as well, we even ran out of 4 bottles of pepto!!! We were on the toilets for more then half of the stay! which is a lot because u sleep for half of the day... Pool- The pool was freezinng cold! I tried to get in numerouse times running nearly catching an amonia. I also saw many gross things in the pool: such as cigarettes, bottle caps, hair, poop!, sharp thing tht i cut my sellf on, dubiose floating object (don't know what tht was!) and many, many more. Beach- That would probably be the only somewhat positive about this resort. On the other hand, you could go to a hotel right beside it to have the dame beach... Not too many rocks and a pleasent walk. Cats- In usually every hotel there are cats... to keep the mice away... But in this hotel, i do not know what happened too them... One had 1 ear, one had 3 legs and and one had a nib for a tail! i felt so sry for them! Grounds- There were these cute little animals... I forget the cross... something between an anteater and hangeroos i think... they were adorable and they like bananas. The plantation was doggy not well waterd.

Our room was unacceptable, no towels , empty fridge, nasty tub and veiw of an alley ! LLoyda ( female) at the concerier desk was rude when we asked to change rooms and informed me this was a European spa and not many Americans came to this resort and most people thought their rooms were great. After showing us a few we got and ocean peek room and water and a few beers in the fridge. Our lock on the door was broke it took them over three hour to fix, they told us just go to the beach and don't worry about it ! ( not!) I tried to take a plate of food from the cafateria back to my daughter in our room who was not feeling well and Martin the head Matrade\" came sprinting after me telling me I can't take the plate out of cafeteria. After 10min. negotiation, I signed the chip plate out. They were more worried about the 25 cent plate then our door lock not working !

Liked most of the others said it was nearly impossible to get in to the 3 speciallty restauraunts, I ending up talking to the head hotel manager Jaun, he just kept making up b.s stories and finally got us in one of them, the food was excellent and the sevice was awesome, should not be that hard to get into.

He should probably go big time comic ! If you are looking for a GREAT beach and fun intertainment ( great show every night ) this is the place for you ! There were very few Americans, we only met 6 others. It was a topless beach.

Our kids ages were 17, 21, 22, and 24. I was a little nervous after reading some negative reviews, but the main reason I chose this hotel was because of the beach. It is definitely the best in the area. They have a sand restoration machine that certainly does its job. One morning we got up after quite a windy night and both hotels on either side had lost 4 feet of sand, but not ours. It is completely sandy and great for swimming. The red flag was up all week, so unfortunately we didn't swim as much as we would have liked. The sandbags are there for a reason. I don't think they are too unsightly in front of the Viva compared to other hotels. The pool was a little cooler than expected because they had had a cold spell just before we arrived. It was well maintained and a big plus was the really comfortable mesh lounge chairs!! You will get a towel card, if you lose it or your towel they charge you $20.00 but this is standard at alot of All Inclusives I think. You could take food and drink to the beach which was nice. This hotel markets to Europeans, there is topless sunbathing just to be aware if you are uncomfortable with this. Alot of guests don't speak English, going off shoulder was terrific, the hotel wasn't full at all. Rooms - The hotel itself is older, but kept very clean, there are some areas in the hallways that could use a bit of paint. The large marbled common area near the lobby (which is beautiful) is deadly if it rains!! So slippery you can't believe it. Be careful The rooms are basic, but clean. Shampoo, soap, blow dryer, fridge, safe and TV is provided. The beds are very, very hard, but we were amazed that we found them comfortable. The air conditioning works well, and cuts out the hall noise when it is on. We used the safe of course for passports, money and valuables, but nothing we left out was taken. I had read a couple reports of theft, but think it is unlikely. You shouldn't drink the water in the rooms, bottled water is left every day, and you can ask the maids in the morning for extra. Especially if you are leaving the hotel on a day trip. Tip the maid a couple of dollars a day. Food - for some reason the first night the buffet was terrible. The rest of the time it was good to excellent. I didn't enjoy the ambiance of the buffet, it is noisy and reminded me of a school cafeteria, not as nice as other places we have stayed in. The Mexican buffet night is fantastic! Breakfast is very good with made to order omelettes, if you want bacon, you have to ask, it is behind the counter by the kitchen. the cheese platters are terrific. I found the juices a little watered down compared to other hotels. They keep the restaurants pretty empty for some reason. Perhaps to save money on staff. Men have to wear long pants, but we did see people in shorts. We booked our nights the next morning at 8:00 am, and also tipped the doorman at the Mexican restaurant (which was fantastic) to let us in another night. the Portofino was excellent as well. The waiters really know which dishes are the best to order!! I never regretted listening to their advice. They serve mixed drinks there as well. The pool buffet is lovely to have, the pizza is pretty good for Mexico, they also have fresh fruit, hamburgers, hot dogs and always hot lunch items and soup from the buffet there. I thought it was great. I guess 5 star people would complain, but overall I thought there was something for everyone. Drinks - I don't know why people complain about the drinks being watered down. If you want them stronger, just ask. The staff are eager to please. The lobby bar does make better drinks than the pool bar overall I think. They have 8 oz hard plastic glasses instead of disposable which is good. We like to take travel mugs, keeps your drink cold and the sand out. The beach is always clean, no litter Entertainment - We were spoiled last year at the Royal Decameron in Nuevo Vallarta, they had a professional dance troup and their shows were excellent. The nightly shows at the Viva were just so so, with 3 excellent dancers and the rest just average. Some people were new and still learning the routines, but all in all we appreciated their effort. But the entertainment staff all have terrific personalities, and we enjoyed them during the day!!! My girls loved dancing at the disco at night with them. They try hard and seem to enjoy their job. If you are wanting a reasonable (three star) place to stay with a fantastic beach this hotel is just fine. Would we go back? With the family for sure, because of the price. It was our 30th wedding anniversary and the hotel had a bottle of champagne and fruit/cheese platter in our room which was very nice. The one thing I really liked was that this hotel is very safe for my daughters. We could go to bed at night knowing they were fine in the disco. or staying up. The walk into Playa del Carmen is very safe, night and day. It takes about 20 minutes, the area is very upscale and secure. The city is very nice. No need for alot of taxi's, just walk into town and get on a local bus for $1.00 or take a collectivo (white 12 passenger vans) that run constantly for 35 pesos (about 3.50). Coming home from a day trip, you just stand on the highway and flag them down. Always make sure you get the price first so they don't take advantage of a tourist. Take the collectivo to Xel-Ha for the day, they drop you on the highway, and you just walk 5 minutes down the road. The entrace fee is 75.00 US. I was not too keen about doing it because you can snorkel quite a few places, but we had such a wonderful day I would recommend it. You can prebuy entrance tickets at the hotel front desk that saves you standing in line once you get there. (nice if there are cruise ship buses in) It was quite a bit of money, but well worth it. Includes, towels, lockers, wonderful buffets, all drinks including alcohol, and snorkeling equipment, bikes, snacks......everything. The water is warm, the snorkeling is great, the park is so big we didn't see everything, it is well laid out and beautiful. Take the collectivo to Coba ( 1 1/2 hours) $7.00 US....our driver took us right there, and offered to meet us at 2:30 and then drop us at Tulum for the rest of the day because we were a party of 6. We enjoyed seeing both ruins. Tulum is beautiful being right on the ocean, but we all enjoyed being able to walk up the ruins at Coba. I recommend seeing both as they are different. In Coba some of us rode bikes around for $3.00 each and the rest walked. We also went to Akumel beach. There is a lovely park there that is $9.00 US entree fee. We went to the main public beach, they say that it is mandatory to rent life jackets, but it isn't, they really just want to encourage people to not walk on the coral. I don't think it is worth it to pay for a guide at all, we didn't. We saw giant turtles, and near the reef the snorkeling was good. We walked across the highway up into Akumel for lunch which was alot cheaper and more authentic. Try and get out to see some of the cenotes. You can google them and pick from about 200. I would do your own transportation everywhere. Especially if you flag down a local bus for a buck. Much cheaper than taking tours everywhere. The people are friendly. We never did get to Cozumel. I heard the ferry is $14.00 each way now. It runs out of Playa del Carmen. My husband and daughter went para-sailing in front of the hotel. They paid $90.00 US for both and went tandem, I was terrified for them, but it was the highlight of their holiday. There is so much to see in this part of Mexico. We could go back for another two weeks and still not see everything. So if you don't like relaxing on the beach this is a good destination for you. If you are used to 4 or 5 star hotels, I think you are better off somewhere else. We knew what we were getting and all in all were quite pleased.", "Date": "December 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cWedding & Family Vacation- Great & will return!\u201d", "Author": "Bree9107", "ReviewID": "UR22293714", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel November 8 - November 18, 2008, along with 17 other guests (ranging in age from 6 to 65) who accompanied us for our wedding on the beach at this resort as well. We & our guests booked the rooms through Expedia approximately 11 months in advance and chose Viva Wyndham Maya for the wedding. We had no troubles with flights, transportation or rooms. We have to admit that Viva Wyndham Maya was not our first choice for the wedding as we had hoped for another resort within the near vicinity; however, we were unable to get the other resort to answer questions and respond in a timely manner. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise as the wedding and family vacation turned out to be absolutely wonderful and so much more than we had hoped for, thanks to the gracious staff and the efforts of Marco C. (the wedding coordinator)! Marco C. was great and very informative regarding the resort, the options available, and the treatment of all of our guests. Prior to arriving at the resort, we sent him a list of all guests & flight information such that we could block rooms near each other in the resort. Marco ensured that our guests were all within reasonable proximity of one another, as well as all of our guests received their rooms prior to the 3 pm check-in. Upon check-in, we noted that Charlemayne was great and very accomodating so you should be in goods hands if you work with her when checking in. Rooms: The rooms are older but well maintained and contain refrigerators, safes, shampoos, conditioners, and all have sliding glass windows & balconies. We were fortunate in that the way the hotel is set up many of our guests were able to obtain oceanview rooms. It should be noted that the rooms near the adult pool are newer but have no ocean view; therefore, there is a trade off and you have to decide if you want the newer rooms or oceanview rooms. Food: We have read previous reviews regarding individuals complaining about the buffet and not being able to get reservations in the finer dining establishments. The buffet is large and contains on a nightly basis, items like, salads, pastas, fruit, meats (chicken, lamb, fish, and pork), potatoes, and desserts. Regarding reservations--- you must book at least 1 day in advance for the restaurant that you want due to limited supply. We & our guests never had a problem in booking restaurants, in fact several of our guests only ate at the buffet one night (the night they checked in) and were able to get reservations every night. The trick that we found was that the reservations are booked at the front desk & the front desk never fully book the restaurant. Simply show up at the restaurant at opening and ask if there are any cancellations or if they can accomodate any more. This worked many times as the wait staff were very accommodating and were able to get tables of 10-12 in for dinner without reservations. We found that Jose A. (at breakfast), and Gabriel and Abel in the Miramare were very helpful and do a great job. Wedding Information: Marco C is very good and very attentive to details. A destination wedding at this resort is a very affordable alternative to a traditional wedding. This sort of wedding is not for everyone due to the lack of control; however, Marco C. will take care of everything for you and you have no worries at this resort. We arrived & met Marco immediately upon check-in and got to our room and found many treats including fruits, wine, and other items waiting for us. Next, we met with Marco for approximately 2 hours about 5 days prior to the wedding to finalize details, such as the set-up (on the beach), songs, flowers, display, wedding cake, meals, witnesses information, etc. Marco then took us to get the required blood tests, which are also handled at the hotel... so its very convenient. We then met with the photographer (Lemmy), regarding timing of pictures and expectations, which is also on-site. Also, the resort has an on-site salon where you can get your hair, nails, and make-up done the day of the ceremony... so its also very convenient. While meeting with Marco, we actually decided to change the time of the ceremony due to lighting concerns due to the sun settting. We also had additional guests who opted to stay at another resort in downtown Playa del Carmen and Marco relayed all of the necessary information to those guests as well. We opted for a 4 pm ceremony and everything turned out absolutely beautiful, with the ceremony, the setting, the photographer, and wait staff with champagne on the beach. The reception followed in the Miramare restaurant (overlooking the ocean) and the food was excellent, wait staff was great, and the cake was beautiful. Overall we were completely thrilled with the outcome of the wedding and how nice everything turned out. The way the resort is set up, everyone can view the ceremony and we met several guests from Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and many other countries who indicated it was one of the most beautiful weddings they had seen due to the set up, the lighting, and the music. We had a total of 21 guests, but approximately 150 actually watched the ceremony. We then continued to vacation another week at the hotel after the ceremony and were constantly meeting people who watched the wedding. We actually met a couple that was looking to get married and are now considering the Viva Wyndham Maya as the place for their wedding based upon what they had observed. The beach-- This hotel has the best beach of all of the hotels in the near vicinity. The hotel works hard to restore the beach and has put in sandbags to help with erosion. The sandbags are approximately 25 yards out from the beach and help to create a calm beach area for guests to swim and snorkel. Just beyond the sandbags, the depth of water drops significantly (40-50) feet and sort of acts as a natural reef which you can swim along and view many types of fish. We regularly walked the beach in the afternoons and you know you have left the Viva Wyndham Maya's beach because all of the other hotels have not worked to protect the beach and in many cases the other hotels have no beach at all. The entertainment- This resort is also a great place for families and the entertainment staff work hard to involve the guests in day-to-day activities. The resort also has a kids club. Nelly is absolutely fantastic! The resort also holds nightly entertainment and variety shows on their outdoor stage, which is a great time to socialize and meet other people. Also, the kids are regularly involved in the shows, which makes for great entertainment and good pictures as well. Tips-- Although this resort is all-inclusive, we found that the staff respond well to tips. Since this resort is heavily European, we noticed that most people do not tip; however, a few dollars a day ($5-$10) spread between the maids, bartenders, and wait staff seemed to go a long way. The staff try hard to make your stay at the resort a pleasurable experience and work long hours (10-12 hours), usually 6 days a week; therefore we felt a few extra dollars as tips to reward a job well done was appropriate. Overall we loved the resort, the wedding, the staff and the beach and would recommend the resort to the cost conscious traveler. The resort is not a 5 star resort and is a great deal for the money! We look forward to coming back in the near future and many of our family members are considering adding the resort to their annual vacation destinations!", "Date": "November 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn", "Title": "\u201cSubpar Service, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "jkoven1", "ReviewID": "UR22168535", "Content": "My girlfriend and returned from our stay at the Viva Wyndham Maya, and while we had a great time off the resort, the service at the hotel left us a bit frustrated. Let me preface this review by stating that I am well traveled and have stayed at 4 and 5 star resorts, so I am accustomed to excellent service. We arranged airport transportation through the hotel and both trips were fine. After we checked in we were advised to make reservations at the 3 restaurants at the hotel. However, the restaurants were all booked until the 4th day at the resort! This baffled us b/c we paid for the all inclusive and couldn't even get a reservation. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise b/c the food sucks at the resort. The buffets are like college dinning hall feeding frenzies and don't even touch the house wines. The breakfast buffet was the only meal we ate every day and it was fine. So the food is crap but the drinks were good. Walking towards our room, we quickly realized the hotel was outdated and needed a renovation. The rooms are okay, but all the paint and decorating is old. Our bathroom was crawling with tiny ants so we had to move rooms, and called down to the front desk 3 times for towels. The beds were incredibly hard and uncomfortable. When we checked in we were given towel cards and were warned that if we didnt present the cards no towels would be given to us and the cards needed to be returned or else we would have to pay $20. What hotel operates like this? Threatening guests about towels? Oh and make sure you bring your towels to the hot tub, (which we needed to make a reservation for), b/c they don't have any towels at the spa area?? I And when we checked out, we asked the guest services person who was sitting at a computer, to check our flight status. She refused! The hotel is in a great location and beach/pool is quite nice.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by the front desk staff with a complimentary welcome cocktail, which gets you in the vacation mood instantly! We were escorted to the lunch buffet while we waited for our room to be ready. The buffet was incredible...a huge assortment of food, something for everyone and it was all presented so beautifully and everything was delicious! Our room was ready immediately after lunch and was immaculate, overlooking the pool/ocean and well-stocked with towels, bottled water, soda, beer and even had shampoo, body wash and soap. The bathroom was enormous and beautifully tiled in granite. The shower was awesome, excellent water pressure (better than we have at home!) After we dropped off our luggage, we walked the grounds of the hotel and felt like we were on a tropical island! The landscape is immaculate, lush, colorful and spectacular to walk around. There are birds chirping everywhere and you really feel like you're on the most lush tropical island ever! We walked to the pool area which was jumping with excitement and fun! The animation team was getting everyone involved in the acitiviites that were going on and again, there was something for everyone. My son played ping-pong, basketball, waterpolo, darts, soccer, pool games everyday - we never saw him, he was entertained the entire time, the staff treated him like a little brother and made sure he got involved in everything! I enjoyed morning aqua aerobics and kayaking plus step aerobics in the afternoon. My husband loved the afternoon water polo, bocce, ping pong and just relaxing pool side with a delicious drink from the bar. The specialty restaurants were INCREDIBLE!!! The presentation of the food was like in a 5-star restaurant!! The night of my 40th birthday, we ate at Portofino, the mediterranean restaurant...after we finished our meal, the lights in the entire restaurant went out, I thought it was a power outage! But NO! The entire kitchen staff came out of the kitchen banging pots and pans and our waiter was carrying a gorgeous cake that my husband had pre-ordered and they sang Happy Birthday to me, it was spectacular - they really made a big deal over it! The buffet dinners, breakfasts, lunches...all excellent! The specialty restaurants, ourstanding! Try the Tamarind Margaritas at Don Diego's!! We loved everything at the resort so much, we changed our minds about going on the excursions and just hung out there all week partying and having a wonderful time. The staff cannot do enough to make you happy! In the evening, there is a live show everynight....INCREDIBLE!!

They quickly learn your names and are very social. Overall we had a great trip. There were 10 in our party ranging in ages from 8 months to 62 year old.

Azteca we went to the azteca one night for dinner and checked it out it is definetley a little better kept up but smaller than the maya, and seems to be very quiet. we went over at 8pm for dinner and the place was almost a ghost town, if you want a quiet place to go with smaller shows and a little more laid back atmosphere book there. for me i liek to have fun and be around people the maya was lively well into the night, but never rowdy everyone seemed to have a mutual respect for each other, and the partyers had fun while the people who wanted to retire to their rooms did so at the maya. the azteca seemed that everyone just retired to their rooms early. staff awesome people. i speak a little Spanish but most of them spoke english well enough to get by. once again a few bucks goes a long way and they really appreciate it. everyone always had a smile on their face despite working 15 hour days, believe me i would not have a smile on it i had to work like these people worked, so once in a while someone might not be as friendly but you can understand. the entertainment staff was great so were the bartenders down to the grounds crew. go there with an open mind and expect that some things wont be 5 star but the place and the people make it a great experience i wish i could of stayed another week, and plan on going back in the future. thanks to everyone at the Maya for a good time", "Date": "November 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swasea, Wales", "Title": "\u201cHoliday of a lifetime!\u201d", "Author": "cpt-carrot", "ReviewID": "UR21345957", "Content": "Saw the hotel on First Choice internet site and practicaly booked straight away and glad we did.

A good idea before booking is making sure how you will get to the hotel cab rides are about 80 dollars. As soon as you arrive you are greeted with non-alcoholic beverages which is great. When we checked in we were asked where we were from, we live in Texas but also own a house in Mexico so we gave our mexican address I really do not know if they gear more towards peolple from the US or Foreign countries or at least that is how I felt. It is a kid friendly place, the gardens are beautiful the landcaping is impecable , but the service is not that great. The first night we wondered around the hotel we had dinner and joined the staff at their nightly performance. I had requested a king size bed and a crib for my little one, of course I was told they did not have one, so we settled for 2 beds, which are not that comfortable and I did ask for a fridge for my kids milk, but there was none to be found in the room there was an empty space were one should have been. When we finally got to our room I was going to put my daughter to bed so I removed the covers and saw, what I thought was a mouse dropping, I did call the front desk to let them know, but it was to late to move from one room to another so we spent the night. The next morning I had lost my sunglasses so I moved the mattress and out comes running a lizard from under our mattress. At that point I did request another room and the front desk told me there would be another room ready by one o'clock, so we left to the beach. For some reason they gave my room to someone else, so we ended up staying in the same room. Our second night we also left to their nightly show and I forgot my babys bottle so I went back to the room to pick it up, I open the door and there were 3 hug spiders inside I did get to step on them before they reached our beds but I really do not know if there were already some inside, I did call the manager and he apparently did not believe me, since I had already complained once about the lizard I guess he wanted to see that there were spiders (tarantulas) in the room he did come over to verify and I practicaly had to beg for another room and had to explain to him that both my daughters dis not speak so they would not be able to tell me if something would have bitten them. They did move us from that room that night, but I still got a double and no crib, and that is were we spent the rest of our vacation. The food is good the only minus is that they do not have a air conditioned buffet restaurant for daily breakfast, lunch or dinner and it does get kind of hot to the point where you can't even enjoy your food. We did not get to visit the a la carte restaurants because of the kids. The Beach is beautiful and it is always packed you can't get a \"palapa\" you need to wake up earlier than 6:00 a.m. to get one and of course that wasn't possible, so my husband had to tip a guy for 2 beach chairs and an umbrella. The hotel is secure it is gated and they do ask for room numbers to verify you are a guest. The hotel has a photographer that will go around taking pictures we did get to take professional style pictures at the beach and they were awesome. They do have cool Bars and the Drinks are good. All in all it is a beautiful hotel on the outside, the rooms are not comfortable, the restaurants have good food.

Booked with CheapCarribean after seeing special on Travel Zoo. Happy with all. Room was simple, but very clean, comfortable and pleasant. The bath was newly renovated; bath/shower combination, excellent plumbing. Room had small balcony, small safe, stocked fridge. Housekeeping was excellent and efficient. Beautiful beach, nice area surrounding the hotel, beatiful landscaped grounds, courteous staff, good drinks, 2 efficient bars. I had been to Dreams Tulum before and had gone to Tulum and Coba ruins and did not go to ruins this time. Went on snorkeling trip near the coral reef. It is much more taxing physically to me in the sea than it is inland in the cenotes and fresh water lagoons. The bicycles at the hotel are not exactly top of the line and are worn, but I enjoyed riding around Playacar and into Playa del Carmen. The food buffet is massive and I really don't understand when some people say they can't find what they like there. There is virtually every food type, with omlet and fried egg stations in the morning, and carving, grill, and pasta stations at other meals. The house wine is very good. The other guests were predominately European tour groups although there are some Americans who you can easily spot and converse with. The Europeans while I was there were mostly Dutch, German, and Italian, and were mostly very friendly and social. Most of the Dutch and Germans could speak english, but it seemed fewer of the Italians did, which was too bad because they seemed the most social and fun to be around. A tip about bringing tequilla back...I purchased 2 bottles in Cancun in duty free shop and carried on the plane to Houston. After customs there, they won't allow you to carry the bottles onto the domestic connection. At duty free in Cancun, have the bottle bubble wrapped, check seals, and make sure you have room in your checked bag if you have a domestic connection after arrival in the states. It was the rainy season, which I hadn't known before I booked, but I enjoyed it anyway. The rain would come and go, but on the day I left, it didn't stop. The last time I was there, it was March, and not a drop of rain and beautiful sunny weather everyday. Yucatan is a wonderful place and Cancun is set up to serve tourists from the time you enter immigration and customs, which I think are the most efficient I have seen anywhere, until you leave.

The shows I love the Madonna show and the Disney using the children staying at the hotel weres great. The Pirate show was a mish mash of all Pirate shows but all in all not so bad. Cabaret was good. Why they put an \"Adult only\" on that I still don't know. The Grease show Avoid it if you can. I had read a review from a person who said they had money stolen from the safe. I can't believe that. There is no way they would do that. Heck I left money on the counter for the cleaning lady to take everyday and she never touched it. Unless she moved it over to dust the area it was on.

Miramare is by far the best!!! We ate their twice. The chicken is great!!! On the flip side Portifino is just okay. And when we were there the Mexican restaurant was closed. We did eat at the Japanese restaurant at the Azteca but it was gross!!! Other than that... we were given a great room by the pool. The pool at beaches were all very clean.

On talking to other guests it appears we were given the inferior rooms. No tea or coffee making facilities, no fridge, no shampoos or soap. We did notice that the rooms on the other floors were nicely polished floors with the occasional flower and towel art. Something that is usually the norm in the caribbean. We found the reception and bar staff could barely raise a smile. We had a lot of rain whilst we were there and the animation team used this as an excuse to stop working. It was very boring during the daytime with no entertainment. On the plus side the hotel and grounds were laid out nicely. The beach area was nice and there was a good variety of food. The speciality restaurants were excellent and the waiters in each of these restaurants were brilliant. I cannot praise them enoiugh. A must whilst you are in Mexico is a trip out in the evening. We did the bar crawl and it was excellent. The Captain Hook pirate ship dinner cruise was brilliant and great fun. A really good night out for adults and children.

Simon spoke to them ...(who may I point out that someone assumed him as miserable,he's actually a really nice French/Canadian guy, who is just quite laid back, and if you speak to him enough is very helpful)After this all was ok.and fixed immediately.This area of the hotel is a bit antiquated! FOOD: We were quite happy with all the food presented, maybe a little more variety on some nights.But passable, and remember if you go ...at breakfast, to ask for the bacon as for some strange reason they keep it hidden behind the bar where they fry eggs, but was very nice!Think breakfast had the most variety you could imagine, just looking at it all could make you go up a size! STAFF: Most of the bar staff were friendly especailly the night ones, but we found the day time staff could be really quite miserable and sometimes rude.All cleaning and other staff were friendly. BEACH AND LOCATION: Beach is fabulous, beautiful white sand, turquoise sea, plenty going on, lots of sunbeds, but grab one early.They have large concrete boulders which have been put deliberately in the shallower part of sea to act as breakers for when they have a hurricane, but outside this hotel they are not too bad, further up tthe beach they were more unsightly...but do serve a purpose.Playa del Carmen is about 20-30 min walk to town...and worth it...bustling shopping centre and bars, and even a Signor Frogs...which we visited and at our age should now know better,but did we have fun!! ENTERTAINMENT: We found exceptional, compared to some we have experienced before on other Carribean hols.considering they were all very hard working multi lingual staff that presented it,...bear in mind that they are miming to music like Madonna, Elvis etc,they put on a really good show , and most of them are brilliant dancers, who really should be up the West End of London!

We travelled with our almost two year old as we wanted to sneak one trip in before she has to start paying for the tropics. Beach: The beach was great with the slight exception of the big black wave breakers they have outlining sections of beach right in front of the property. I imagine the reason they have those there is to eliminate beach deterioration during tropical storms and/or hurricanes (we've travelled to that area in the middle of a hurricane before and saw how the beautiful beaches take a beating and disappear in front of your very eyes) but it still takes away from what could be a much more beautiful vista. The sand in that area is to die for. Staff: Our experience with the staff was very positive, however we did not have any weird things we had to deal with. Another family we met on the journey out had some problems getting response from the staff and after a strange experience with somebody braking into their room had to be really firm as to what needed to be done \u2013 but that was their experience not ours. We really liked the wait staff in the main dining room, they were always smiling and kind and a total pleasure to see each day. Food: Not as much variety as I would have liked to see, however not nearly as bad as a review I read earlier on. I by no means was forced to eat beans and fries throughout my stay. There were many healthy options (healthier than beans and fries) for food just not a lot of variety within the various food families. There were nights when I had a lot of choice and some where my choice was more limited. This being my fifth time in Mexico and my second time in an all inclusive I was once again amazed at the bad behaviour, poor manners and general gluttony by the average guest at the resort. It\u2019s quite embarrassing. Rooms: This was my least favourite part of the resort. Our building and room were quite old \u2013 or so it seemed. The bathroom seemed recently renovated and was nice, but the actual living quarters (which of course we spent as little time as possible in) were so-so. There was no fridge in the room, which made it tricky with a toddler who is still drinking formula. The other negative aspect of the sleeping quarters is that the hallways \u2013 due to their concrete nature \u2013 were extremely loud. It seemed like the sound from outside in the hallway was amplified through the door. Add to this very disrespectful morons sharing your floor, partying until all hours of the night and screaming in French at 3am as they are coming home drunk from wherever, all the while hanging out in front of your door to finish off a long winded drunken conversation \u2013 not cool. Our last night there (we could only sleep for a few hours as our airport transfer was leaving the hotel at 2am) there was some bar music that came on at 11pm that sounded like we have the best sound system in the world \u2013 IN OUR ROOM\u2026 great if you\u2019re hosting a killer party, not so great if you\u2019re trying to get some sleep before a very long trip home with a toddler. The Property: Nice but there were some efficiency holes. Have been to places of equal value with much more amenities, but we were there to relax, and enjoy the beach and the local atmosphere. For instance we tried everyday to get into the kid\u2019s club to play in the park, never managed to make it in once. There was never anyone there \u2013 ever. The gym was nice, and not very busy (everyone was busy eating beans and fries I guess.) It would have been nice to have air conditioning in it, but alas. We met some wonderful people on this trip both locals and tourist that we will keep in touch with. While there we love to spend as much time exploring Playa Del Carmen, a wonderful little town with great people and an awesome vibe. Before baby we had stayed there as a couple and really dug it, and I\u2019m sure that in a few years we\u2019ll be back doing it all over again, but boy is it nice to go to an All Inclusive with a munchkin to really get a chance to relax, do no cooking, no cleaning, and actually get a chance to read a book \u2013 my first book since before I became a momma.", "Date": "October 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta", "Title": "\u201cFirst Time in Mexico\u201d", "Author": "AlbertaSmile", "ReviewID": "UR20673800", "Content": "This all inclusive resort was very nice.

I am a travel agent so I will list all the positives and the negatives as short and sweet as I can ! The transfer from Cancun was super smooth - it was with Sunwing who I have had good and bad experiences with but this time - perfect ! We were brought directly to our bus and taken to the hotel (about a 45 minute drive). The first glimpse of Viva was great - the property is very nice and very clean. The first issue was on check-in. I was told that we had been upgraded to the sister property Viva Wyndham Azteca a few doors down. I am not one to turn down an upgrade to they sent us over to the other hotel. All I can say is that of the 2 hotels, the Maya is by far the better one. The Azteca is very small and the rooms are not very nice, the buffet was awful with very little choices. Needless to say we only stayed there one night and requested to be switched back to the Maya which was no problem at all. The beach at the Maya is beautiful - yes there are sandbags but they are there for a reason! and they are quite fun to sunbathe on and jump off! The water is a incredible shade of blue and they keep it very clean. The main pool is a wee bit small but I spent my time at the relax pool for adults only which was very nice (could be a bit cleaner but with all the suntan oils and creams that people where, it's hard to keep the pools impecable). The room was very nice - but be sure to ask for one in the newer building at the back near the relax pool because the ocean view rooms are like the ones at the Azteca. We had a great view of the relax pool, a jacuzzi in our room and a couch area with a nice sized balcony (the ones at azteca are tiny - you can't even sit out on them). The cleaning service was great and efficient and they always made a towel animal :) The bar service was good - we never waited - get Mango Margarita's - simply the best ! We only made it to one a la carte - the Mexican Haciendo Don Diego and it was fabulous ! Yummy ! Other people said the Portofino was also very good. My negative has to be with the buffet - where is all the good Mexican food ??? I love mexican food and was expecting to be chowing down on it all week but to my dismay, the selection of Mexican was very small. The food was so so -I've been to many all incusive's in the caribbean and in comparison, the choices were not that good. I think the buffet is a 2.5 / 3 star at the max. They always had a pasta bar so if I did not find any good food, I'd have a bowl a pasta but when in Mexico I want to be eating Fajitas, Enchilladas, Quesadillas, Tacos etc but did not see any of those things all week ! So my advice to the Maya - change up the buffet and forget about having Chinese and Italian nights - concentrate on the Mexican, after all we're in Mexico ! If we can't get great Mexican food there - then where ? They offer free bikes to go into town which was awesome ! We did it almost everyday - the only thing I would say is extend the times - the bikes need to be brought back by 5pm but Playa comes to life at night so it would've been nice to be able to take them at night too. Did not make it out to the shows except one night - the talent show and it was very funny ! Activity wise -we got a bit jipped since Ike was around and no water sports were going out all week - but that's the weather's doing and the hotel was doing their job by keeping us safe ! They have archery which is great - the guy running it David is super nice. They have a trampoline and rock climbing wall but it was closed all week - it finally opened 3 hours on our last day and I got to jump like a little monkey but it was disappointing to know that there was nothing wrong with them but were closed all week and they were supposed to reopen in teh afternoon but never did - If the activities are there, then you gotta keep em running expecially when the water sports are down. The grounds are incredible, there are all kinds of iguanas and lizards and rat / rabbit like animals roaming around ! I fed them all week long ! We did one excursion, the all inclusive Isla Mujeres catamaran and it was soooooooo great ! Don't book through the hotel - go across the street to the Playacar Plaza and there are a few tour booths set up - there you can bargain and we got ours for $65 per person for a full day which included transfer to and from the hotel, the catamaran cruising, a shark petting adventure, an hour or so of incredible snorkelling, a visit in Isla shops, and afternoon with food and drinks at a private Isla beach and a form of parasailing - it was the best excursion I've ever done and for an awesome price. Shopping is good in Playa but bargain because they will always tell you a really high amount at first and then when you say no they're go way down - an example we bought the three monkey statues (the no see no speak no hear) the guy started at $90 for the three and we ended up paying $25 for all three ! The weather was awesome and sunny all week - it's very hot in Sept - their most humid time ! Block up if you're not used to the sun ! All in all the Maya was a very nice hotel - would I recommend it to my clients - not sure - if the food improved definitely but that really needs to be worked on. If you're not a picky eater then the hotel is great - if you can get reservations every night at the a la carte then why not !!! Last but not least, on Friday night they bring in the local merchants to set up their stuff - most is the same that you find in Playa but look for one guy - he does finger paintings on tiles all one of a kind for $10 - we unfortunately got their too late and all the tiles were spoken for but it is really incredible to watch this guy work !

Great choice!\u201d", "Author": "MyLSD", "ReviewID": "UR19281503", "Content": "Let me first start by saying... that my friend and I were up until 5am researching before we finally decided on the Viva Wyndham Maya. We opted to say in Playa Del Carmen because we heard it was away from the busy scene in downtown Cancun. Good choice. Playa Del Carmen was a very nice area and provided us with a relaxing vacation. When we first checked in, we were an hour early, but they were able to get us into the room. THANK YOU FOR THE A/C! Whew. It was sooo hot and humid when we were there (Aug 13-17), so everytime we walked into our room, it was a huge relief. The room was a good size and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was clean and Guest services was always prompt whenever we needed to change out our towels. \"Rich\" at the front desk was excellent with customer service... we even lucked out and got an AMAZING view of the pool and beach from our balcony (see attached pictures). The scoop on the resort: When you first get there - BOOK YOUR RESTAURANT reservations asap! They fill up QUICK so you want to make sure that you get some dinners in at their restaurants. However, the buffet was pretty darn good. Each day they had a variety of things to eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. When we did get reservations, we at at Don Diego for Mexican food. It was very very good and service was impeccable. If you are there for lunch, the ceviche and the tuna/avacado appetizers are the BOMB. We did also do one night for dinner at their sister hotel (Azteca) and ate at Bamboo. It was \"alright\". We are Asian, so we weren't completely blown away by the food there. Would have more opted for Don Diego... because we were in Mexico and wanted... well, Mexican food. duh. Gotta admit, we loved the 'all-inclusive' perks. The snack bar by the pool was always fully stocked. My friends loved the burgers they served at the snack bar later at night. The drinks were also kept flowing. We did end up booking massages and facials at the Renova spa on site at the hotel. Prices were common to US prices so that was disappointing. But we booked for 4 people so they gave us 25% off. (be sure to ask for discounts!) I though thte facial was pretty good. and the guys enjoyed their massages (they were oddly given male masseuses though - but at least they had strong hands). My other friend didnt enjoy her massage as much, stating that the girl didnt focus enough on her neck and shoulders. In the end, we found out later on, that there are a BUNCH of places to get cheaper massages on Quinta Avenida (5th Avenue). I saw prices like $35 for a 50 mins massage! dammit! So, location of the hotel was pretty decent. it is seriously RIGHT ACROSS The street from Plaza Playacar. Here is where there is a Starbucks and little shops and stands to shop at. Prices were higher than Quinta Avenida of course. Quinta Avenida was just a short taxi ride away so that was nice too. Costs 50 pesos to take a cab there. Dont pay anymore than that and distinguish that before you get in the car! All in all, our stay at the Viva Wyndham Maya was excellent and we would definitely stay there again if the price is right. My scoop on the tours/activities: Well, we did the Snorkeling Adventures which was very fun! 3 excursions and lunch provided... $76pp. We also did the Chichen Itza tour that included the Cenote and Vallodidad stops for $99 pp. Chichen Itza was definitely worth seeing, but the DAMN TOUR BUS ride took FOREVER!!!! It took 2 hours to pick up all the people BEFORE the 2 hour drive there even started. lame. If I could have done things over, I would have tried to look for a smaller tour group size that gets me quickly there and quickly back. I swear we got picked up at 730am and didnt get back until 8pm. and half of that day was spent in the [--] car. We booked both those tours through Olympus Tours, who are cool to work with - BUT are soooo off on the times they give you. Dont believe them when they say you'll be back at 630p! They also told us that we needed 'biodegradable' sunblock if we are snorkeling or swimming in the cenote. So we had to buy it at Plaza Playacar because it was the only place we could find it and it was [--] $13 for small bottle! THEN, it turns out no one even checked our sunblock on the tours. WASTE OF MONEY. Our favorite tour was the ATV tour. This was booked at the stand at Plaza Playacar. I think the company was called ATV moto. it was soooo much fun. $110 for two people to ride on the ATV. Tour was about 3 hours and included riding through the beach, jungle, and then to a cenote where you get to swim in the caves. FUN FUN. (Note: you get HELLA dirty!!! but its worth it.) Ask for Ricardo to be your guide. He rides fast and real cool. Thos are my thoughts for this trip. All in all, we had a great time. Came back tan. Didnt shop too much though (the sales girls this time around werent much for bargaining with and nothing came out to be a spectacular deal). I did suffer from 6 bug bites that I didnt get until the very last day, so remember to pack your benadryl. P.S. US Airways sucks. for a 4+ hour flight, they are too cheap to even give us drinks. changed $2 for a bottle of water. So unless you want to spend money, you will suffer from thirst and hunger on that plane. BOOO on US Airways.

I have been to many All-Exclusive hotels (Dominican Republic & Costa Rica) and the staff is very eager to please you and make your stay enjoyable. In the Dominican Republic the people were friendly, they had live singers, and they also had a big Barbecue on the beach which was enjoyable. THE ROOMS: The rooms are very uncomfortable and run down. The room I had was a steam room because the Air Conditioner wasn\u2019t working properly. The satellite TV they mention in their website is a joke. The TV had bad reception and finding English speaking channels was a challenge. The faucet in the showers was leaking hot water and would burn to the touch. The beds were very hard and uncomfortable. After I complained several times about my room the front desk decided to move us over to the newer rooms. The rooms on this side of the hotel were more modern and very comfortable. It even had a whirlpool bath in the bathroom, better reception (TV), good AC and best of all the beds were very soft. Overall: The beach is beautiful, the show were wonderful, and the local stores easily accessible. The staff needs to be friendlier and the food could use some improvement.

During the summer months there is alot of European tourists...not a problem as long as you realize the European women perfer to sunbathe topless. I was not aware of this and we went there as a family...including my 15 year old son. We probably would not have gone to this area had I had this info. The beds are VERY firm.

Rooms The rooms were of fair standard for what was in them, clean with modern bathrooms so don't expect 5 star and you won't be disappointed, it's a good 3 star. The aircon worked great but was very loud but on the plus side you didn't have to have it on for long. Rooms were cleaned daily by the maids (obviously) and they gave it a general tidy although sometimes you couldn't tell they'd been. Food Overall food was fine, the buffet for breakfast and tea was mainly geared for Americans or Germans but a good selection was available. The pool bar pizza is great, and a good selection available all day if you don't like pizza. I recommend that you visit the al'acarte restaurants at the end of each week as the standard in them are much higher and you may find the buffet disappointing otherwise. Make sure you book early as they say it gets full, although when we went half the restaurant was empty! It's a must to go to Portofino restaurant it is by far the best! Bar International brands are available at no further cost but you need to specify thats what you want. Entertainment Show's available every night they are good but even better with a few drinks!!! Pool/Beach Pool is small but never too busy when we were there. Plenty of sun loungers, but if you want a parasol get up early, a couple we met got up at 4am to get one!!! no thanks. Beach clean and the sea is lovely the only down side is you can't swim out due to man made sand bags half way out. Doctor My partner had to see the onsite doctor which is 80 dollars just for a consultation never mind treatment, you could only pay in cash which is a problem if it's a costly visit.

This country is at its hottest during may - normally i dont burn - but i did - badly - cover up and drink plenty of water. The food at the hotel was first class and so was the entertainment and staff.

This was the second time we went back to the same hotel - never do this - your spoilt the first time - book another hotel - plenty in this area to choose from. Anyway kids and adult entertainment great - plenty to do on hotel grounds and lots of excursions - suggest the deep sea fishing - very good. Mexicans are friendly people - they do try to get you into the shops but they dont try that hard - just say no thanks and they understand and leave you alone. Swim with the Dolphins in Cancun if you can - this is good. The hotel is on the beach, the sand is like white powder, no litter - kept immaculate. Some large iguanas walk about - as soon as they see you they run away (unless its just me!) but they dont bother you. Dont buy anything from the hotel shop - as usual it twice the price of the shops. A the top of the roads on the way out of the hotel turn right, walk 100 yards there is a small shopping centre - things are cheaper but expect to pay same prices as the uk for most things. At this hotel you can get involved with activities or just chill out - its up to you. No shortage of sunbeds and you dont have to be early or put towels down. You can also use the sister hotel 10 minute walk up the beach - we didnt do this so i cannot comment. The shows in the evening were fantastic. You can get a taxi from outside the hotel to Playa Del Carmen - larger shopping centre, with lots of stalls, food places etc and they have a burger king.

Here are my only two 'beefs': the 'nice' restaurants are almost impossibe to book. We tried to make reservations on our first day and only got 'in' on the last day for dinner. I noticed that it was always only half full. Seems to me that they prefer you eating the buffet - probably cheaper for them. The buffet's ok - but it gets a little tired after the 3rd or 4rth day... my boys started a soccer game evey night which - I'm sure - was one of the highlights for more than a few young kids every evening. They were shut down pretty harshly every night by the set-up crew for the evening show. My issue is: unless you lock your kids into their all-day daycare camp (might as well leave them at home in camp, then...) there isn't a lot for them to do.

We normally stay at Adults Only properties in Cancun but really wanted to give Playa del Carmen a try. We picked this hotel because it is very close to town and also for the Adults Only pool option. We arrived and were told to come back at 3pm for our room, we went to get lunch at the buffet and then down to the main pool. The main pool seems very small for the number of people it needs to accomodate, maybe because it is summer and there were SO many children but it seemed crowded to us. At 3pm we headed back to the front desk and got our room. We were put in the block by the adults only pool. We had requested a king bed, this had 2 doubles but we decided to keep the room because of the location. The room itself was really nice, always very clean, big, great AC and a huge jacuzzi soaker tub. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful, they do lots of work to keep them up. The beach is stunning, yes there are sandbags but they are there to keep the beach beautiful! I walked the beach a bit and this definately seems to be the nicest in the area. The location is also wonderful, only a 5 minute cab ride into Playa and all the wonderful shops, restaurants and bars. We had never stayed in this area before and really fell in love with Playa del Carmen! The food was really good BUT the buffet can be a bit difficult to enjoy it at. Same as the main pool, it just seems too small and crowded for the number of people it needs to accomodate. To get any of the fresh made items (pasta, omlettes etc.) you have to be willing to wait a long time. I know, you are on vacation so what's the rush but there is also no air conditioning in the buffet area so standing in front of a hot pasta station for 10-15 minutes isn't very comfortable. I have no idea how the people working there do it....they really did try their best to keep up and the crowds were definately not their fault. The waiters in the buffet, same thing, just too many people to deal with. We went to breakfast 4 times and were asked once if we wanted coffee. They are just run off their feet. The a la carte restaurants are really nice, great food, serive and atmosphere. Be sure to book them right when you arrive though, they fill up fast! I booked on Sunday morning and couldn't get in until Wednesday night but did get into all 3 (Mexican and Meditteranean were our favourites). Having the option of an adults only pool was great! It was very clean and quiet and had a great little pool bar right there. The beach was also amazing. We spent most of our time in these two places. We also enjoyed that they had live music every night in the lobby bar, it was a nice place to sit before heading into town. So, overall, I would say we really enjoyed our time at Viva Wyndham Maya. It wasn't perfect and did reinforce our preference for adults only properties in general but I would still recommend it.

Ate in Portofino twice, again excellent, and Miramare good as well. Fresh fruit and juice every morning, cereals, omlettes made to order in front of you, cold meats and cheese, 10 different yoghurts, you name it, apart from baked beans anyway. Pancakes for the North Americans, (i note one of them put in a review food was bland apart from pancakes- hello, what is blander than those). Beach Was very good, I agree with those who thought sand bags added to it, as they were now looking like large rocks, with seaweed growing, and attracting fish for snorkeling. Facilities great, get up early to reserve sunbeds if you need an umbrella, at the end about 6.30 would do. Staff great, made real efforts with shows, worked so hard, also Jesus in La Terrazza was a great guy. Never had any tummy problems at all.

We arrived late on a Friday and were allowed to eat at the buffet that night. We stayed 5 nights and that was plenty during this time because it was very hot. The buffet has a good variety of foods for breakfast, including omlettes cooked to order, eggs over easy or sunny side up, traditional mexican fare of meat, beans, salsa, and tortillas, plenty of fresh breads, fruit and pastries as well as a variety of drinks including coffee. and that's just the stuff i looked at. I prefer the chilequilas and salsa, but my daughter went for the beef steak, beans and tortillas. alot of the europeans were eating all sorts of other things that i didn't consider, including several meat and pasta dishes as well as some rice dishes, noodles, soups, yogurt, cereal, and even some fish. The weather was hot and this room is not air-conditioned but it's large and all the windows are wide open and the ceiling fans are churning so if you sit in the right place you can get a breeze. For lunch, we often ate at the snack bar by the beach/pool. There was always plenty of hamburgers, hotdogs, and pizza, which my two sons went for as well as the nachos. I preferred the freshly made guacamole and chips and i usually grabbed a bowl and had that. drinks at the outside bar were great. they have a variety of alcoholic as well as non-alcoholic drinks with a mixture of fruit concoctions that tasted delicious. most of the time we went for the non-alcoholic drinks because of the heat. but we also drank plenty of diet-sodas, water, and beer. we ate at the mexican restaurant and twice at the italian restaurant overlooking the beach. they were both excellent. it was not time- consuming at all. it was a welcome change from the food at the buffet and i enjoyed the fresh salads that came with the meals. Usually i don't eat salads in mexico but in these restaurants they were like at home. (Note: i have visited mexico in my youth and have learned that things like cheese, sour cream and milk are not the same in mexico, so i just avoid foods that have them. no big deal.) the rooms were very clean and spacious. we did not come for the pool or the tv. we have those at home. we came to experience the beach, the carribean water, and the sites. the beach is spectacular. the water is so fabulous to swim in. if you get up early, which i like to do to see the sunrise, not only can you snag the chairs under the palapas (shade huts) but the water is the calmest and the clearest. The sand bags did not bother me. the water is quite deep before you even reach them. it was a nice work out to swim to the sandbags then swim on the other side to snorkel. my youngest and i snorkeled on both sides of the sandbags and saw a variety of fish. if you wait until later in the day, the water gets more choppy from the boats and jet skis, which stirs up the sand on the bottom, making it harder to see. We also noticed that at high tide in the a.m., it is easier to swim over the sand bags, where as later as the tide lowers, it is almost impossible to get over them. so you have to swim through the channel. our family made use of the kayaks (good exercise for the arms) and my husband and kids got a ride on a catamaran. we also used boogie boards. all were included with no hassle. off of the beach we played bocci ball and fussball. it was also fun to watch the activity directors teach visitors the merengue. we brought our own deck of cards (pretty cheap) and a deck of Uno and had family games in the shaded patio by the pool bar when it got too hot to sit on the beach. we did pay extra to let 2 of our kids parasail together and the other one use a jet ski but it was worth it. they were taken right away with no waiting and they loved it. there is shopping nearby and you can also take a taxi for a small fee to downtown playa; other than that, it was so relaxing to just read in the shade, sip a drink, and enjoy the view. there were a lot of europeans (smoking!) but just a few who were topless and they didn't garner any attention. they looked rather androgynous to tell you the truth. the rooms were spacious, clean, and the air conditioning worked great. i had to turn it off at night because it got too cold. the bathrooms were a good size, the water pressure was strong and we had adjoining rooms with our kids! we were very happy about that. the staff were very nice with the exception of one man who for some reason insisted there was only one night during our stay when we could get a reservation at one of the restaurants. (You can only make dinner reservations at one of the 3 restaurants between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. at a desk in the lobby) It was absurd, and we were unnecessarily disappointed. We had dinner in the town that night (it's only a short walk to downtown playa del carmen), but after that we just went directly to the restaurant where we wanted to eat and were able to be seated after an hour. We didn't care. We sat at the bar and drank until they were ready for us.) The next day my husband was able to get a reservation at that same restaurant from another person at the same reservation desk. go figure. other than this one gentleman, who offerred no suggestions on how to get a dinner reservation, however, the staff was great. they were helpful, our rooms were always clean, they worked hard continuously to keep the grounds clean and the food and drinks flowing constantly. we tipped generously at the 2 restaurants because we were so happy to be eating there and we appreciated the finer food. On our day of departure, they let us keep our wristbands until we were picked up to go to the airport (about a 2 1/2 hour wait after check-out time) so we got to eat and drink while we waited. that was very nice of them. i took a walk on the beach and this was by far the nicest beach and hotel around us. it has a large staff that is always working.", "Date": "July 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bolton", "Title": "\u201cRooms !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Bigjockknew", "ReviewID": "UR18041907", "Content": "Hotel was very clean,staff very friendly.Room we booked was a superior room,room given was like a room from a holiday chalet at bognor,air conditioning is dated and very loud.Got a better room after two attempts(up by adult pool),more like a superior room.beach was lovely despite the sandbags.weather was superb,had a great time once we got settled into room.Pool nearest the beach needs to be cleaned on surface more regularly(lots of scum first thing in morning on surface)", "Date": "July 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Biddeford, Maine", "Title": "\u201cEXCITING WEEK AT THE MAYA!\u201d", "Author": "kimush5", "ReviewID": "UR18020158", "Content": "My sister and I headed to the Viva in Playa Del Carmen for a relaxing week-long getaway from it all.

The staff were helpful, but we found some staff not to be overly friendly at first. After the first day, most warmed up to us. We found that if you were nice and spoke to them, they were nice to you. Neither of us spoke spanish, which would be very helpful here. The first thing we noticed when we got to our room were the fanned towels on our beds. The air-conditioning was already running, and it was very cold. Yes, it is true, there are no dressers in the room. No big deal, we didn't go there to spend our time in our room. Yes, the air conditioner was loud, but it helped at night, as our room was right outside the stage where the nightly entertainment was and the stairway to the second level (we were on the first floor). We never heard a thing. The staff did a great job at cleaning the room. The beds were hard, but we found them extremely comfortable. We both slept like babies. The food was exceptional! We ate at the buffet every day for breakfast and lunch...always something different to please your appetite. There was a daily pasta station at the buffet..you could add what you wanted to it. Also, at breakfast, they had awesome omelets, again adding whatever you wanted to them. We especially liked the italian restaurant, which is right above the bar overlooking the pool and the ocean. The mediteranian restaurant food was also excellent. We did not eat at a mexican restaurant, because my sister does not like mexican food. They were kind enough to let us eat at the italian restaurant twice. They also had pizza, hamburgers and hot dogs right by the pool with some fruit, nachos, etc. This was also good. We recommend you book your restaurant choices as soon as possible. The bar had many choices...I recommend if you like shots to try a tequila boom-boom. The choices were unlimited! We took a trip to Fifth Avenue....very interesting. If you don't want to be bothered by all the locals, stay at the top of the hill. We also took the ferry over to Cozumel...definitely worth seeing!

In fact i'm very laid back and don't bother to nitpick all the little things like leaky faucets or a static TV that never worked properly. (Didn't bother to report it either.) HOTEL: Beautiful and clean. The maintenance staff were very thorough and were constantly cleaning the grounds and rooms. The layout of the hotel is nice too. Plush greenery everywhere. It was like walking through the rain forest everyday. Quite romantic! ROOMS: We had a DELUXE Room which was pretty basic. The bathrooms are nice and roomy and you get Bath towels & slippers to use for the week. The slippers are so comfy! The TV is the tiniest little thing and it didn't even work the whole week so it didn't matter how big it was. Wish it could have at least shown local channels. FOOD: Ok, in this i'm a VERY picky eater so perhaps my review of the food may not be shared by others, but I was not impressed with the food, particularly at the buffet! I didn't think there was much variety and I found the food to be VERY bland! The only good thing of the buffet was Breakfast. French toast and pancakes were delish! HOWEVER, they kept switching the HONEY & SYRUP canisters and I ended up with French toast with Honey a few times which was not pleasant! :( The food at the restaurants was much better although prepare to be there for 2 hours. The service is very slow, although very friendly! Tips are certainly accepted though not expected. I always left at least $2-3 for the servers because they were just so polite and always had a smile on their face! ENTERTAINMENT: The entertainment staff were fantastic! They did a great job of getting people off their bums and join the action and they really interacted with guests. Every day there was something going on on the beach or the pool or the stage area. BEACH: This particular beach area was hit very hard by the hurricanes a few years ago and has experienced much corrosion. However, the hotel has worked hard to preserve the beach as much as possible and in doing so, they placed these LARGE sand banks that kind of look like beached whales. It can be a bit of an eye sore but if you can get past that, it makes for great swimming! I wasn't bothered by it but I know many people were disappointed. POOL: The main (and only) pool is pretty small. It's a good thing we didn't go during high season or else it would have been chaos. In my opinion that pool is too small for the size of the hotel. The kids pool is also connected to the main pool by a fence and if you\u2019re planning on taking your children, this is the only kid friendly area other than the beach. There is nothing else for them to do! So be warned. ACTIVITIES: Now this is where I have an issue with. It rained 4 days straight during the week I was there (I went in June which is rainy reason.) The hotel does NOT have any activities to do for rainy days! There are no pool tables, or cards or a games room. Nothing! We were virtually stuck in our rooms still in stopped raining, or hanging out in the lounge bar which was too small to accommodate everyone anyway. For a 4* hotel, I would have expected much more activities to do on these kinds of days. So that was very disappointing. Also, since you're in the middle of a residential area, there isn't really anywhere to go outside of the hotel. 5th Ave has a Starbucks (which is right across the street) and some shopping to do for souvenirs (cheaper than at the hotel). Remember, be savvy with them or else they'll charge you an arm and a leg! But there isn\u2019t anywhere else that is walk able. You\u2019ll have to take a cab to the nearest town which is about 15 mins away. OVERALL: It was a very relaxing trip but I don't think I'd go back. Not that I had a bad experience, but this hotel just wasn't my style. The lack of activities was just too disappointing. I\u2019m not the kind of person to just roast on the beach for a week.

We got to the hotel about 60 min later, there were other tourists the shuttle had to drop off in Playacar, but it was nice to get an idea of the whole area. We were greeted and given a welcome drink as we checked in. Because this was our honeymoon they had placed a bottle of champagne and a bottle of wine, along with fruits and cheese in our room. We had room # 3319 in the newest building of the resort. We were very happy with the room; it was next to the adult\u2019s only pool and away from the rest of the resort. We did have to do a lot of walking because we were off set but that was not a big deal. They do have a small fridge in the room stocked with beer, juice and water. We left tips and notes in the fridge with what we wanted and it was always full. You can also ask the front desk for bottled water they always had a supply. We also tipped the maid everyday and we got towel animals so that was fun! The resort had a lot of things to keep you occupied, and different tournaments and activities everyday along with the everyday games and things. They had a cooking class, a bikini contest, bocce ball tourney, darts tourney and so on. They have a rock climbing wall, archery, a gym and a spa. We don\u2019t have children but it seemed they did a lot to give the parents a brake and have activities for the kids. Every night they would put on a show, some were good others not really. I am a personal trainer and I was excited about the morning stretching/yoga but this was a let down for me, but happy to say it was the only thing I was disappointed with. We did not go to the spa there, too pricey for me. We did find a small massage place in town and we got side by side one hour messages for $35 each we wanted to add on 20 min and they gave us a great deal, $90 Total. Were we very satisfied and happy that we did not fork over $200.00 to the hotel spa. It was called \u201cThe Luxuriant\u201d they were located off of 5th Ave on 2nd underneath the All Riviera Hotel, it looks a little shady on the outside but it was clean on the inside and the owner was from Huston and had his certification from the United States so that was nice. The food was great! No complaints about the buffet or the restaurants. There were plenty of healthy choices for me and unhealthy foods for my husband, so we were both happy. We tried all three restaurants the Italian was my favorite and my husband loved the Mexican one. We both like to drink and the first night we were there I think we tried every tropical and fruity drink they had, from that point on we stuck to pina coladas and margaritas. I did not care for the house wine, but the beer was not bad at all. The beach is the best of the area, but it was a challenge to find a chair with some shade. One morning I did get up at 5:30am and put our towels down on a prime spot, and it was nice to have it for the day. So far as water activities we used the boogie boards frequently, took the kayaks out once and we really enjoyed the catamaran tour. One day we took bikes into Play Del Carmen; it was a lot of fun for me. We asked the bike attendant for a lock and we locked up the bike in town and walked around, it is really beautiful there and there are many shopping options. We went back again at night ($5 taxi ride) and found hands down the best Mexican food we have ever had. The restaurant was called Corboncitos it was on 4th Ave off of 5th We went there because of all the good reviews on trip advisor and I am so happy we did, what a meal and it was only $35 usd with tip. We then headed down the street (5th Ave) and found a cool bar on the corner with swings as ball stools. The place was plastered with dollar bills, the bartender will give you a pen and you can right your message and glue up your dollar, just like they do in many other American bars. We just had one beer each $4 usd, but it was really neat. Down on 2nd off of 5th there is another bar with swings that has 2 for 1 beers but the bartender was not as entertaining. We ended our night at Viva Margarita, it is at the end of 5th in the Plaza in-between papa johns and starbucks. It is a very small place only outdoor seating but the margaritas were great and only $5 each (12oz) We went to Xel Ha one day, it was worth the price, a beautiful eco park with plenty to do and the food there was surprisingly excellent. We paid $135.00 for the two of us, this include all food and drinks (The had corona on tap\u2026nice), snorkel gear, towels and a locker. They say you can only use certain types of sunscreen there but nobody checked our bag but I did feel good using a eco friendly product being that I was swimming with some beautiful fish, but It did cost me $17 usd. Snorkeling was great once we found a spot away from the crowds, the rope swing was really a let down, don\u2019t bother\u2026the cliff jump was o.k. would have just spent more time snorkeling or lying around on Hammock Island next time. We are glad we did not pay a lot for transportation, there is a bus station on 5th in Playa Del Carmen for $4 usd you can get on a bus that stops at Xel Ha and Tulum. Thu bus was air-condition and very comfortable. The bus station is very unorganized and not really on time, but much cheaper. We went to Tulum another day, we took the same bus. Make sure you have pesos with you the closest ATM was all the way in downtown Tulum, we had to pay $10 taxi ride to go to the bank and back. There was a shuttle from the gate to tulum it is only $2 round trip. It is worth the money to not have to walk on that dusty road in the heat. To get into Tulum was only $5 or $10 each. It was beautiful the beach there was very crowed, we had worn our bathing suits and had planned on going in the water but decided against it. We had paid round trip for the bus but found out the first bus was at 4pm it was 2pm and we were ready to head back. There were collectivos there and for $3 each, be careful they make you wait until they have a full van to leave so make sure you try and find a van that is almost packed you will make everyone inside very happy. The van really did not have air conditioning but it was faster then the bus. We paid a total of $2,229.00 (1,100.00 for air fair & 1,129 to Viva Wyndham Maya for the week) so not a bad price. Things I would do differently\u2026make sure to bring plenty of your own sun screen, just about everywhere they want $15- 18 usd for a small bottle, Exchange a large amount of money, most places would not take credit card. If you are going to one of the eco parks go early so you have more time to play, We had $100 in singles I think maybe $150 for next time.", "Date": "July 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "richmond, va", "Title": "\u201cOk..but not great\u201d", "Author": "yacopee", "ReviewID": "UR17615795", "Content": "food was ok, beach was great. tours were awesome. room was not that clean and we were not impressed w/ the resort itself.

I`ve stayed at all inclusive resorts in Mexico for each of the last 5 years (three times with kids, twice on my own) and rank this resort at the bottom of the list. The food was only fair in the buffet (though the a la carte restaurants were good if you could get a reservation) staff attitude was very poor (excluding the cleaning staff ,bar and entertainment people who were just fine). The beach was nice, the pool was okay (the other resorts I`ve stayed at had much larger pools or more features associated with the pool). Check In: 2 weeks before arrival I joined Wyndahm by Request (hereafter ``W by R``)for free as I read a review that said doing so provided some benefits. 10 days before arrival I emailed W by R and advised that as my flight was scheduled to arrive at midnight in Cancun, and the tranfer to the resort would likely take another hour or two, could they ensure that an additional cot would be placed in my room (as we were four people with only 2 beds) and explained I would have young children with me and would appreciate anything that could be done to help with a speedy check in so I could get them to bed. I recieved an email back from W by R 5 days before departure confirming that my request had been sent to the resort and ther would be no problem. When we arrived at 2:30 am there was only 1 person manning the front desk - it was only by sheer luck that my eldest son managed to run up and be 3rd in line for check in while I grabbed our bags - behind us in the check in line were about 12 other guests who had quite a wait - we only waited about 15 minutes for the 2 couples ahead of us to be checked in. When we got to our room our door keys did not work - we managed to get in as my brothers adjoining room key did work. When we got in the 2 rooms we found no towels whatsoever not even a face cloth in either room, no bottles of water - though my brothers fridge had 1 soda water and 1 can of sprite left in it. My brother (who is a spanish english interpreter asked the bell boy if he could get us some towels, some water bottles and my door lock fixed while all six of us walked over to the 24 hour snack bar for hotdogs and drinks. When we returned 40 mins later nothing appeared to have been done - we called the front desk and got no answer - I then walked back to the lobby and after ringing a bell for no less than 10 to 15 minutes someone arrived who couldn`t speak english but radioed for assistance. About 10 minutes later the check in fellow arrived and said someone would repair my door lock shortly and that he had put in a request for a cot but there was only 1 staff person working at night and they would get to me as soon as possible. I showed him my Wby R card and said I had emailed over a week earlier to avoid this delay. He responded by saying that `we don`t even look at emails until the guest has checked in at the resort`` . With regard to water bottles the fellow tells me if we don`t have any then were not entitled to them. I respond that were on the all inclusive plan and he tells me some rooms are not entitled to have free water bottles. When i get back to my room I review the hotel binder which says we`re entitled to 2 bottles each day of our stay. It took 1 more hour until our cot arrived though less time for our towels to come. Room: Okay average, very loud but effective air conditioner though the one in my brothers room was just as loud but hardly cooled at all. The toilet in my room constantly trickled a small amount of water all around its base - I constantly kept a bathtowel wrapped around its base to soak up the slow leak. Food: We arrived on Sunday morning so we made the mistake of waiting till monday morning to book our restaurant reservations. The only available reservations at that point were for 9:30 at night which we took though for one restaurant the computer only showed room for dinner for 5 though there were six of us - we took it anyways over much concern expressed by the staff member that only 5 of us could expect to be seated and served. The food at each restaurant was excellent though there were problems associated with having a 9:30 reservation. In each instance at the restaraunts we were the last people to arrive and found that only a handful of others were still seated - the result seemed to be that certain dishes or deserts were no longer available - not that they were out of supplies but rather that they had already shut down a grill or a station for making strawberry flambe for example and weren`t prepared to start it up again just for us. Also in two restaurants they shut the air conditioning off at 10 and when it became stifiling they said there was nothing they could do as the AC was on a timer. Also we got the sense that the restaurant staff were upset with us for keeping them there past 10 pm as in each instance we were the last customers in the restaurant being served. The buffet was less than impressive I`d rate it fair to satisfactory but would not give it a good or above average rank - each of the other Mexican resorts I`ve been to did better. There was an eating area by the open windows (nice to have a breeze) which was reserved for VIP and Wyndham by Request memebers - when we sat there we were hassled because we didn`t have a special band needed to sit there - so I go to the front desk - show them my Wby R membership card and ask for the band - they tell me that I can only get the band if I booked my reservation through W by R whereas mine was booked through Sunwing holidays so i can`t get the band or the benefits of my membership (which benefits I`m told are an upgrade to an ocean view room and access to 2 VIP areas otherwise off limits to guests). At the snack bar the pizzas are great when they decide to make them, the hotdogs often looked undercooked, we ordered 2 burgers and found pink and red (undercooked)areas in them after taking a few bites - both my son and I had stomach problems the following 2 days. Check out: We had an early morning flight back so we had to check out before 4 am. I am told I owe $5 USD for a phone call no prob I pull out a us five dollar bill. The clerk tells me he can`t accept the bill because there is a small (less than a half cm tear in the exact center of the bill. I try to assure hime the bill is fine but he insists he can`t accept it. I offer a Canadian 10 or 20 dollar bill and he tells me he can`t accept canadian cash as the hotels money exchange does not open till 9 am. Iask if he has tape and finally convince him to tape the top of the bill. When we then proceed with check out were told we`ve only handed in 5 towel cards though they say we were given 6 at check in. I make room for the possibility that my 7 year old left a beach towel on a chair instead of returning it for a card. The clerk insists that we must pay $20 USD for the missing beach towel. We dispute that we ever got 6 and offer to open our luggage to show him we have not taken any towels whatsoever. He tells us that if we don`t pay the $20 then the security guard at the gate will be instructed not to allow us to leave the property until we pay. After many attempts by my brother to resolve this in spanish and the clerk insisting he will not let us leave without paying, my brother suggests just have a securty guard on duty pick up any of the many towels by the pool which the clerk refuses to do so I finally decide to run all the way back to the pool and just pick up the first towel I find on a chair and return that to the lobby clerk who accepts that in the place of our missing towel card. Total frustration and no sense of practicality - similarly when I tried to take a plate of bread and cookies out of the buffet area to bring food to 2 of my kids too sick in bed to come to breakfast, I`m told I cannot take a plate out of the eating area - so I take a table napkin and try to wrap up the bread and cookies - I`m then told I can`t take a napkin out of the eating area- just no sense of serving the customer`s needs whatoever. I`m generally not a complainer and I`m pretty easy going on vacation but the above and several other instances of the hotel staff being petty and unhelpful really bothered me at this resort and I cannot reccomend it. The Grand Palladium White Sands or Kannetah or Colonial about 1 hour south of this resort were far better in all areas than this place. I\u00e8d also rank the El Cid Mazatlan or the Club Med Cancun far above this resort.", "Date": "July 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auburn, Ca.", "Title": "\u201cPromised taxi rides from airport to Viva Wyndham.\u201d", "Author": "inspectorgw", "ReviewID": "UR17489021", "Content": "I was promised taxi rides from the airport to my hotel and from my hotel back to the airport.

All of us really enjoyed this vacation. The resort is very nice, the beach is one of the best in the area, the customer service is exceptional...staff really goes out of their way to make sure the guests are having a good time. This resort caters to the American travellers and appreciates their business. I saw some criticism over the sand bag beach restoration work. I really would like to say that the sand bags are beach savers for this resort. First, they ensure that limited beach doesn't wash away as many of the other beaches in the area, second, they are turning into natural dunes and coral and fish are using them for habitat. We all specially loved swimming to the sand bag dunes, climbing them, sun bathing over them, jumping from them, etc...They are quite an amenity for this resort and an example of a successful beach restoration effort for others to follow. The entertainment staff seems pushy at first, but I recommend that you loose the stiffness on the first few days, loosen up, and join in the fun. You'll get the wisdom of their over chearfulness by day 3 or 4 and it's quite contagious. I gaurantee if you join in the activities that you'll have fun. Amin is the lead entertainment staff and is very very funny. The nightly shows are amateurish, but funny. The food is above average considering that this is an all inclusive resort. Our favorite ala carte restaurant is Portofino, the Italian Restaurant on the beach, and Bamboo. At the Bamboo, we were specially treated to a japanease steak house experience, where the cook grilled all sort of things right at our table. The sushi was not the greatest. The buffet is really good and there is definetly something for everyone. I specially enjoyed the breakfast selection. It can get rather hot in the restaurant, so find a seat near a window facing the ocean side to get cooling breeze. Here's a tip for the beach. I recommend that you assign the early riser in your party the job of getting up around 5:30 am and reserving shaded beach or pool chairs. To do so, you can replace at the end of the day your towels with clean towels instead of getting your card back and using these towels/beach toys to reserve the chairs. Noone moved our stuff and it seems everyone understand and respect this reservation rule. That person can then go back to sleep afterwards. You will never find shaded chairs otherwise and the shade is very important shelter throughout the day to avoid sun burns. We are definetly going back.

Arrival: We arrived at 2:00 pm and our room was not ready but they quickly put on our bracelets and ordered two welcome drinks (peach bilinis) and told us we could go eat at the buffet or go down to the beach and our rooms would be ready at 3:00. The room was ready at 3:00 just like they said. The staff: Everyone was great! The front desk staff were very serious but they were not rude to us. The entertainment staff were very friendly, we even had one ask if she could sit with us during lunch one day. The waiters and housekeepers were also very friendly and helpful and showed they wanted to make sure we were taken care of. The resort grounds: They are beautiful grounds and well kept. The gardeners are at it everyday. I love the smell of the whole place. I think it was the grass roof of the hut like walk ways. The room: Our room had a partial view of the ocean. It was small but it had everything we needed. Everything was spotless and it smelled very clean. We tipped the housekeeper $2.00 everyday and we always had extra clean towels and water bottles. The air conditioner was loud but it did not bother us and it did its job and kept the room very cold. The beds were hard but that\u2019s the way they generally are in Mexico. There is no box spring just the mattress on top of a slab of cement. We were so tired from swimming and sight seeing that it really didn\u2019t matter at all. We slept just fine. The Beach: The MOST beautiful beach I\u2019ve ever seen! It was amazing! I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes when I saw the color of that ocean. An aquamarine blue so intense it kind of looks like they\u2019ve gone and colored it. The sand is a beige/white color and is very soft and powdery. The water is super clear you can see a few feet under. The jumbo sandbags didn\u2019t bother us. They actually kept the beach protected form strong waves and anything (fish) that might be swimming out there. The People: We were probably the only Latinos at the resort. Most were Europeans mostly Italians, a few Canadians, and a handful of Americans. The Buffet: The buffet was great! They had al kinds of food available. It was not your typical Mexican food buffet like in the states but more of the Yucatan Mexican Cuisine, black beans, meat stews, fish, and rice dishes. They always had plenty of bread and butter, soup, salad bar, grilled fish, pork, chicken and beef and a good variety of desserts. Breakfast was the best! We did get two reservations for two a la carte restaurants Don Diego\u2019s and Portofino\u2019s. I liked Don Diego\u2019s Mexican (Yucatan) food. I really didn\u2019t like Portofino\u2019s Italian Seafood restaurant\u2026.too fishy for me! Every main course choice had seafood in it. I wanted pasta with cheese but none was offered. The bar: Both the inside bar and the outside bars were good. The drinks were made just right except for the serving cups they use; they are not pretty to look at. The coffee is absolutely wonderful especially the Cappuccinos. I liked the fact that they refused to serve people more alcohol if they looked drunk. I only saw one lady that was drunk the whole time we were there. The town: Take a $5.00 taxicab drive to town. We tried walking one day but had to hail a cab mid way because of the heat. Everything in Playa del Carmen is expensive. Restaurants on the 5th avenue, Starbucks, McDonalds are all priced like in the states. Souvenirs are pricey too. We went to the Wal-Mart in Playa and found everything priced just the same as our Wal-Mart at home. Not any cheaper. The Tours: We went to Xcaret and to Xel-ha. Both were great! The night show in Xcaret was fantastic and worth the price of admission just by itself! The snorkeling in Xel-ha was fabulous! There were lots of beautiful fish swimming right next to us. We also went Parasailing! It was fun but we got a little dizzy towards the end. Flight back home: We booked a direct flight and regretted it. 5 hours in a plane full of High School students coming back home from their senior trip was noisy and tiresome. We were glad when they all fell asleep after 3 hours of flight and we were able to relax for the remainder of the flight.

It is our first time at an all inclusive, but we have stayed at timeshare and other hotels in the area 3 times in the past 6 months. Since we were only planning to snorkel one day and weren't doing any other tours this trip--we decided to try the all inclusive experience. The hotel was absolutely clean and spotless-- in our room, the common areas and the food service areas. This is the one thing that can make or break a vacation for me. They did an excellent job. The room itself was rather ordinary- but we didn't go there to stay in the room. The Wyndham website has a 360 degree picture of their standard room and it is very accurate if you have more questions about the room. It was my husband and I and a 14 year old son and an 18 year old son. The boys rated this their best vacation spot because there was so much to do right at the resort. They did not even do all that was offered. We tried windsurfing lessons, hobie sailing lessons, took out the kayaks and played tennis, ping pong and bocci ball. The boys used boogie boards but went down the beach about a mile south to find the best waves. We used the resort bikes and went into town one day. A good way to get around. We also walked into town one day but that takes a bit longer. We never did try the archery, trampoline or rock climbing wall. We watched their evening shows 5 out of the 7 nights we were there. Our favorites were the Las Vegas show , the Disney show and the Mexican folk dancing - they have some energic dancers. Our son used the internet (cell phone withdrawal was setting in!) and found it reliable and inexpensive. The 18 year old thought the evening disco was \"lame\" - so if you are looking for a night life you may need to head to town or up to Cancun for an evening out. We especially liked the specialty restaurants but cannot find fault with the buffet either. We are not big eaters after being out in the sun all day and we always found something appealing to eat. Plenty of fresh and steamed vegetables, fresh fruit and interesting salads. We do not drink so cannot comment on alcohol served. We loved all of the non-alcohol drinks- they had fresh fruit and juices to mix. All of the staff were courteous and friendly. Most spoke several languages and there seemed to be many guests from Italy, France and Belgium while we were there. Our standout staff member was Jaime L. , over in the watersports. He is a snorkeler, and we were able to get a local persons perspective on where we could go for a shore snorkeling trip and avoid the cattle boat snorkeling experience. (He drew a map& gave us all kinds of advice). We took a local collectivo (van transportation - $30 pesos each) to Akumal. We walked into town and continued down the road to Half Moon Bay. It was some of the finest snorkeling we have ever seen. We also walked over to Akumal Bay and snorkeled out into sea grass with the sea turtles. We ran out of time so we never did try the lagoon there but several told us the Bay was much better anyway.

My daughter had the best time in the childrens center, we would drop her off after breakfast and she would not want to leave when they closed at 5:00. Nelly, Oscar and Marco were all so wonderful to her, as well as were all of the other staff. If you have children between 4 and 12 this resort has a great childs program. They even had my daughter (as well as other children in the resort) doing a Disney themed play one of the evenings we were there. The food was pretty good, I was always able to find food that was tasty and filling. They had fresh pico de gallo as well as Guacomole at just about every meal. Breakfast was my favorite meal, cooked to order eggs, fresh fruit and the bacon was great. We did not have any troubles getting in to all of the ala carte restaurants. The best of the 3 ala cartes was the Portofino - Mediterranean. It was real good. It seemed that if your party size was larger than 4 than you might have had issues getting into all 3 of the restaurants, but as a party of 3 we had no problems at all. The bartenders at the pool bar were the friendliest and quite funny some times. Our favorite was Francisco. It is amazing that if you just tip a bit they will remember you when there is a line and make your drinks in front of others.

And you would think they would know that Cigarrettes kill, I have never seen so much chain smoking from people that weren't still in high school. Overall, if you go by the other reviews and realize that this is not a 5 star resort, you should have a great and relaxing time. We might be back, but we do like to try new things so we will see.

I traveled with my boyfriend and another couple. We booked the trip in January to reward ourselves for finishing finals in May. I am young and so were all of the travelers in our group. We are College Students. But I have traveled almost my whole life because my parents own a timeshare and I have stayed at some pretty classy and fun places. Viva Maya was one of my favorites!! We got in pretty late on Monday the 19th and went straight to the bar. The bartenders are extremely friendly and if they recognize you, they will try to serve you first even if there is a long line. The swim up bar was extremely nice as well. And they don't mind if you swim away with your cup in the pool. There was a very wide variety of drinks to choose from and even if they don't have it. I'm sure they would try their best to make what you wanted. The pool scene was beautiful. With plenty of room to swim around or hang out on the sides with a drink. There was also sufficient space for younger kids to hang out away from the adults which was nice. The Beach was amazing. I agree with other reviews on here that it is definitely one of the best ones in the area. The sandbags are there, yes. But I didn't find them a problem at all, and actually had some fun climbing up on them and letting the waves swipe you off. There were 4 of us. And we never had a problem getting four chairs together on the beach. And often didn't even have to sit right next to anyone. The pool was a little hard to find more than two chairs next to each other, but most of the time we just needed a place to set our sandals and sunglasses so we could dip into the pool anyway. I enjoyed the buffet. I could tell that the staff tried very hard to provide a selection for each night and the fruit in the morning was always fresh. I especially enjoyed the freshly squeezed grapefruit and orange juice for breakfast. We especially enjoyed the restaurants that you could make reservations in. The mexican one was the first one we tried. And we were extremely impressed. The waiters were there the second you needed anything and the food was delicious. Next, we tried the Medeterranian Restaurant. Everything was AMAZING. I had a delicious soup and Salmon that was probably the best I've ever had. Everyone in my group was extremely impressed as well and we walked away almost too full to walk. The last was the restaurant above the pool bar. Pizza and Pasta. I didn't really enjoy this one as much as the others but it was nice to eat outside and watch the sun set. The staff was the best! They were always trying to get people involved and it was fun to join in the contests and games they had going on. I could not believe how hard they worked all day, and they were often most of the cast in the shows at night and still every morning they were out at the pool with huge smiles on their faces. The shows were very fun. They did a rendition of Grease and it was a very fun show for everyone. We went in to town a few times and it was never a long wait for a taxi. $5 will get you in to downtown Playa del Carmen, and it's very easy to find a cab back as well. I would say that this was one of my favorite vacations, and I owe most of that to the wonderful stay I had at the Viva Maya. The reviews I had read on here prior to going scared me a little bit. But I would definitely say. If you are picky and pessemistic about everything. This probably is not the resort for you.

Overall, our experience was very good. The only thing we disliked was the food but I still think it was an okay choice for the money we spent. It was only an issue becuase if you plan on drinking a lot, eating is important. If you want really good mexican food though, you will be disapointed. The Al a Carte resturants are better then the buffet at least, and we didnt have a problem making reservations like everyone else's reviews warned. The waiters are really nice and so are the bartenders. We drank the water at the hotel with no problem, its purified so you shouldnt have issues. Not one of us got sick even from the ice in the drinks etc. The hotel staff was pushy at first, with trying to get you involed in all the games and activities that they did throughout the day, but once i made it clear that we werent interested after a bunch of their attempts they left us alone for the remainder of our trip. I have to say though, they are very good at their jobs and a ton of ppl joined in on the activities it just wasnt really our thing. They also put on a show each night which was fun. The shows were definetly corny and a little outdated but the atmosphere was fun, a nice thing to see before or after dinner, drinks etc. The staff is really hardworking and their always friendly and nice. There was even a beach party one night which was cute. Also something that was nice was that they planned night trips to go out in the area, which felt a little safer being four girls going out. They provided transportation and told us when they were leaving and where to meet in the hotel each time. Be careful though, we went to this club called Balli and it was impossible to get drinks even though we paid for open bar, they wouldnt bring them unless we tipped more and more (rip off) you can ask them about this beforehand maybe. The hotel grounds are VERY clean and well kept. The room was good for what we needed, becuase you barely even spend time in it. It was clean and none of us were uncomfortable in the beds like ppl talked about on here. Yeah there were no dressers, but it wasnt really a big deal, the closet was sufficient and there were shelves. The security was also a plus, you couldnt leave or enter the resort without giving them your room number or showing your hotel bracelets. It wasnt a hassle or andying and it was nice to know they arent letting in ppl off the streets. I would say, this is a good choice if you are going away with friends or a good deal for families. If you are looking for a romantic getaway, I would spring for something a little nicer. It didnt really have that kind of feel to it but it was perfect for what we wanted. Also, I recommend the excursions that the hotel offers (you can book them cheaper online beforehand but within the hotel they have ppl who help you out which is the route we took). The Tulum Extreme was amazing. We saw the ruins, ziplined, repelled and went snorkeling in the caves and the price was very very resonable. Also shop on 5th ave bc they SERIOUSLY jack up the prices of souveneiers and such on the hotel grounds and the tourist spots around the ruins etc. All in all, I'd say this is a good deal, but if we were going back to playa del carmen we would try another resort jsut becuase the food wasnt that great and we left still wanting good mexican food.", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cgreat beach, value and good times\u201d", "Author": "NYCtravels15", "ReviewID": "UR16177759", "Content": "My boyfriend and I just got back from a week at the Viva Maya and have to say we had an amazing week.

You get sick of it after a week but you can always leave and go to the Azteca or the 5th Avenue restaurants as well. We ventured out and the best meal we had was at Bamboo at the Azteca. For lunch, we also would go to the buffet instead of eating the hamburgers and hot dogs at the pool. It's a much healthier option too. Everyday and night there is tons to do.

There were five families in our group with kids ranging from 1-18. I've been the the IB in PDC and the DR, as well as Sandals in St. Lucia. While this hotel is clearly not in the same class as those, my overall feeling about this resort is that for the money we spent, we got a good value for our vacation. Everyone had a good time, and there were no major issues with the hotel. Rooms: We were located in the building adjacent to the Adult pool. This building is more \"hotel-like\" with three floors and long corridors. We came up with connecting rooms which worked out fine. The rooms were decent, AC worked, hot water had some minor issues, the safes worked, and the bathrooms each had a jacuzzi tub. I had no issue with the beds. Was it the nicest room I've ever been in? No. Was it okay? Yes. Food: The breakfast buffet was decent. There were made order omelets, eggs, etc. Bacon was scarce, and the sausages were hot dogs. The coffee was good, and there was always a Mexican option, which I liked. The dinner buffet was okay. Some meals better than others (\"Mexican night\" in particular). The kids liked the made to order pasta. I wasn't overwhelmed, but I was fine with it. A tip to the waiter on one night really improved service the next... The pool buffet was basically burgers, hot dogs, chips guacanole/pico (EXCELLENT), and fries. The pizza was good, but they couldn't keep up with the demand. Some days they had beef or pork on the grill - skimpy cuts, but thats what was to be expected. The a-la-carte restaurants were a nice change, and while the portions were small, the food was good. Please don't expect a Morton's filet at an all-inclusive... Facilities: The one main thing the resort has going is the beach. They have the best one in the area, thanks to their work on pumping sand up. Overall, the resort seemed a bit tired (not that it affected us much) and in need of an overhaul. Because we had kids running amok, we were happy that it is fairly contained, and not a sprawling resort. The kids especially liked the archery range. Staff: The activities staff, waiters, maids, and bellmen were all very nice and hardworking. No complaints! Shows/Nightlife: Although the activities staff work long hours, and do a great job throughout the day, the shows I saw were quite lame. Lipsynching to Michael Jackson? Seriously? Besides the show (which didn't begin until 9pm) , there was nothing to do at night except hang around. The disco opened once the show was over (11), but that was too late for me... Drinks: No complaints - as good or better than Iberostar as far as selection and quality go. Excursions: Go to Xel-Ha, it's a great day. We also went to Tulum via colectivo. Another nice trip, take a swim - what a beach. I would have felt ripped off if I had paid for a Tulum tour however. Take the 5$ cab into Playa - it's no longer the sleepy little fishing town it once was, but it's still a great place. Bottom Line: For families, it was a good value and we had a great time.

I was seriously disappointed and would not recommend this resort to anyone. Upon arrival in the morning, we were told that we could only have our room at 3pm. I understand that hotels do have standard check in times, but they should have been better organized with the availability of rooms for people coming and going. I wasn't comfortable leaving my luggage in the lobby for several hours while I waited for the room to be available. When we returned to the front desk at 3pm, they even had to call the cleaning service to ensure the room was ready. Thankfully it was but I would not have liked to start my vacation with a dispute. After locating the room and climbing 3 flights of stairs with our luggage, I was shocked at the condition of the room. There was no dresser for our clothes, the instructions to operate the safe were missing, the iron was gone, and the beds were rock hard. There were none of the usual items that you would find in a room, no coffee maker, no alarm clock, no extra blankets. The food was nothing to rave about. The A la Carte's were okay, we tried the italian at the Viva Azteca and found it very good. But the buffet was horrible. The nights that we didn't have a reservation at the a la carte, we went into town to eat instead. The best thing at the hotel was the cheeseburgers at the snack bar! The rest of the food was undercooked and even labeled wrong. Out of the 7 days, the wait staff only came to our table twice to see if we wanted coffee or wine (don't drink the wine, it tastes like salt water). And it's true what others have said, people get up before the sun to place towels on chairs. I don't care, that's unacceptable. I can't even count the number of chairs I saw with towels on them that no one sat in for over 5 hours. By 8am all the chairs in shaded areas were taken. The halls are very loud and echo every noise that is made. I wasn't impressed being woken up by noisy drunks in the early morning.

It was an ocean view that we paid for. It was what I expected - not ocean front with full view but a partial view that was georgous. Playacar has the best location! It is only $5 for a cab to Playa Del Carmen or a 15 minute bicycle ride (bikes and locks are free) or a 25 minute walk to Senor Frogs. Definitely felt very safe in Play a Car! Locked bikes up in town square behind police booth so no problems. (The second hotel was $20 each way from Playa Del Carmen and a 1/2 hour cab ride). The value for the trip was excellent. There are other inclusives with better food but you pay the price. You can be creative with what you eat with the cooking station. There is a wide variety to chose from. It is so nice to be able with a family for everyone to eat whenever they are hungry instead of all having to get ready and go eat together. AND THE OPEN BAR - if you enjoy drinking it was great. Did not find the drinks weak. You could always ask for a shot and mix it in if the drinks weren't strong enough. A small tip to the bartender goes a long way in making drinks the way you like them. As for the restaurants with reservations some people did have problems but they tried once in morning to book.

They are also a lot of people from Europe but it didn\u2019t bother me. Some of them like to sunbathe topless, so I\u2019m just warning you! The place is clean and its looks good. POOL: The pool was great and so was the ocean. They do have sand bags and it doesn\u2019t look pretty, but it didn\u2019t bother us. The price was good and you still have room to go swimming. Go right from this resort and walk down the Beach for 10 minutes and it\u2019s even better there. We swam there too! FOOD: We ate very well. We\u2019re not very picky so it suited us. As far as reservation for the Restaurant a la carte, don\u2019t worry about getting a reservation if the front desk tells you they are full. The restaurants are ALWAYS half full, I can\u2019t understand why they say they are full. If you go to the restaurant you want to eat at and beg the guy at the door, he will let you in. ENTERTAINMENT: Every night they put on a show @ 10pm and it\u2019s awesome. I\u2019ve traveled a bit before, and I think this place was my favorite as far as shows. I loved when they involve the audience and you will laugh! Some of them like Carlo & Marco are great Dancers! ROOMS: Our room was good. Keep in mind this is NOT a 5 star hotel. They don\u2019t have a bureau in the rooms but, they do have shelves next to the closet. That helped us a lot since I had 2 teenage girls with lots of clothes. I brought some cheap metal hangers (10 for 1.00 @ Walmart) and hang most of our clothes. I brought 20 hangers and left them there. I had read on the reviews that the bed and the pillows were hard as a rock and I didn\u2019t find that to be the case. We slept very well. RECOMMENDATIONS: I highly recommend to go to the 5th Avenue. We can shop and walk around there and bargain. Better prices than the Market across the street from the Resort. It is a good 20 minutes drive or get a taxi for $5.00. My 2 daughters swam with the dauphins for free if we visited a \u201cTime Share\u201d. We didn\u2019t want to, but it only consumed 3 hrs of our time and we ended up saving $450.00 since we got the dauphins for free and a discount price on a day in Tulum Plus. I would highly recommend going to the Time Share. It\u2019s worth it. We didn\u2019t feel the salesman was pushy at all. At the end of the presentation, we told him we couldn\u2019t afford the Time Share. Although, next time I go to Mexico, I would go to Xelha. I heard awesome stuff about Xelha. Also, I recommend you bring some IMMODIUM. We ALL got stick on the 3rd day in Mexico. I think from the water even though, it is supposed to be from the bottle. We ended up buying it at the store in the hotel but it\u2019s very expensive. It was $10.00 for 8 or 10 pills. As soon as you start not feeling well, take one and you will feel better within a few hours. It works very well. CONCLUSION: All in all, we loved it and would highly recommend as long as you understand that it is NOT a 5 star resort and it can be loud. If you have kids, this is the place too. We found the people very friendly and helpful. My teenage girls hated leaving the place and they would love to go back to the same resort but unfortunately I like to try new places.

Food: The buffet had a great variety for each and every meal. Some foods were repeated every night, but there were always new things to try and favorites to find. I am a picky eater and found lot's to enjoy. Watch out for the rude Europeans who think they run the place and jump in front of you if they can! We ate every lunch at the beach restraunt. GREAT food! Pizza, burgers, hot dogs, nachos, meat balls, rice and fresh fruit all the time! Every supper they had a different pasta bar. Very good! I already miss all the fresh fruit! Service: Other than the rude guy when we checked in, every one was SOOOO... friendly. Everyone says hello.... very friendly, willing to help and chat! Rooms: Are basic. Ours was cleaned every day. We had two adjoining rooms as we have 4 kids, and we tipped 3 - 5 dollars a day. Our room was cleaned thoroughly each and every day. Lot' s of towels, lot's of face cloths, cold water in the fridge, animal towels every day! One room had an armoir, one didn't. Safes are free. Great air conditioning in the rooms and not loud at all. Beds are on the harder side, but had a great sleep. Closets, ironing board, good sized rooms! Beach: Very beautiful and clean. I miss it already. There are sand bags but they dont take away from the beauty. Take a walk down the strip, this hotel had the best beach. If you want a chair or shade, you do have to \"reserve\" your chairs early, before 7 or so. Not a problem for us. The Europeans do go topless and will remove your towels and take your spot without a care. I did have one encounter with them when I removed their stuff that they had placed on our chairs, after removing our towels were that were there since 7.... very rude people! I didn't let it bother me! I DID NOT HAVE ONE TIME SHARE PERSON BOTHER ME THE WHOLE TRIP... I know that this is not the norm, but honestly, no one bothered me! The people that sold jewellery and such on the beach were not pushy and their prices were cheaper than at the markets! ANIMATION TEAM: Best part of the trip, by far! They were working 15 - 16 hours a day and you wouldn't know it. The place was rocking! Lot's to do for kids, adults, teens and couples. Always something going on! The nightly shows were amazing! The kids club was amazing and fun and the kids loved the staff. There was lot's to do! They also have a kids mini disco each night that was fun for the kids! EXCURSIONS: We did a couple. I do highly reccomend Edventure tours. You basically plan your own excursion and have your own driver, van and tour guide for the day. Great people, make sure to tip as they deserve it! This excursion was probably the cheapest too! Make sure to check out Tulum, Akumal Beach and the sea turtles, the cenotes, and more! Overall, great trip!

I don't know who had more fun, the audience or the entertainers on stage. Several of the \"day staff\" actually participated as dancers on stage.

We often stopped in to try out their buffet, use the pool/beach, or see their shows. The worst thing -- the smokers. People would ask to share a couch with you in the lobby, and then just light up. Not just cigarettes either - the number of cigars was staggering -- and disgusting. TONS of the other visitors smoked, and didn't seem to care about other people. However -- there's not much the resort can do to control gross guests -- and overall we loved the place. We are a young couple going on our first resort/all-inclusive together. We expected the three star quality advertised -- and we got it. The buffet was good, and cost-effective, but not fabulous. We always found things we liked -- and especially loved the omelet bar, and pasta bar where they cooked fresh meals to order. Also -- the restaraunts were fabulous and a lot of fun. Make sure to try the Mediterranean one, and ask for the flaming tequila shot -- you won't regret it. Going in to this we were worried about all the other write-ups from people complaining about getting up early to book restaurants. I got up early-ish (8:30) on my first day and booked the entire trip. We got to eat at every place we wanted to -- and they'll even book you into the restaurants at the sister hotel -- Viva Wyndham Azteca -- just a short walk away. Another great thing was the super-fun, cheasy shows they put on every night. We loved them and never missed a single performance. The staff worked SO hard to put them together and it showed. We especially enjoyed their Madonna concert. The staff was super friendly and helpful. We did have a prob. with the toilet at one point, but it was dealt with before we got back from breakfast. We loved this place + would go back. It is clean, close to everything you need -- and does have the best beach of all the resorts in the Playacar area -- which was hit hard by a hurricane a few years ago.

We had been last year to another hotel and enjoyed it thoroughly so had certain expectations. The Viva Wyndham Maya was a huge disappointment on so many levels. We had booked online after having reviewed the Wyndham site including photographs. The resort looked nothing like the photos. While the food was edible, they main dining room was constantly out of things. We could only get bacon at breakfast 2 of the 7 days. With the exception of the maid staff, staff looked unhappy and were often unfriendly. On two occasions we tried to book an excursion only to give up waiting after the two girls manning the counter continued chatting to one another ignoring us completely. Dollars lost to the resort not to mention the loss to our trip experience. Our initial room was a nightmare, no dressers, no shelves, a two inch gap between the air conditioner and the wall, curtains that didn't close completely, allowing anyone passing by on the walkway to look directly onto the beds. After threatening to get on the next plane home, we were provided a room that looked considerably more like that we expected. There was often no drinking water left in the room regardless of our being advised to only drink the water provided there. Security was horrendous! One guest that we had met returned to her room to find a naked man in her bed. The hotel staff had apparently found this man passed out drunk on resort grounds, asked him his room number and let him into the room without checking to ensure he belonged there. Needless to say, she was hysterical and when her husband returned from a fishing excursion later that day, he was none too pleased. The next day, we inadvertantly lokked our keys in our room and asked at the front desk to be let into our room expecting that, after the previous incident, security would have improved. We were asked our room number and given another key without any questions as to who we were whatsoever. We are three women travelling together and certainly will never again feel secure. The evening before we were scheduled to leave, we called down to arrange for a wake up call and pick up of our baggage. They took the wake up call order and told us to call back in the morning to have our bags picked up. When we called in the morning at 6:00 am, we were told no one was available until 7:00. We had to carry out baggage down three flights of stairs. To top it all off, there was blood all over the stairs!

The adult pool, curiously called the \u2019quiet\u2019 pool, is situated in front of the lobby and adjacent to all the bus and delivery truck traffic into the resort, so rather noisy.

The beach here has been largely washed away by recent storms and has lost much of its former appeal. The beach lounges are jammed close together, no tables for drinks.

We've been to two other all inclusives that were much larger in size where you had to take a shuttle around so we enjoyed the smaller property. Beach: The nicest in the area. We tried to walk up the beach but couldn't get too far because other beaches were extremely small and covered with sandbags. The sandbags at the viva maya were very sparse and ran vertically, therefore didn't get in the way of swimming. You need to get down there before 6:00 to get a chair especially if you want one in the shade. There are a lot of Europeans which means topless women walking around, if you don't like this than don't go to mexico period, because they're at every resort. Pool: The main pool area was very nice but again you had to get there before 6:00 to get chairs, especially if you want shade (you will because it gets hot). The animation team always had activties going on in the pool area. Staff: Everyone there was incredibly nice and they all work long,hard hours but still had a smile on their faces and said holla anytime you walked by. Most of the staff had pretty good english. It was enough that you could communicate with them. The animation team was amazing. They work 13 hour days everyday. You see them at breakfast and then they're there doing the shows at 10:00 at night. They were a little pushy when they were getting you to do things but they just wanted you to have a good time. The resort is so small that they get to know you by first name. I did a lot with Elias and Fernando from the watersports area and Daniel from activties. Food: Food was the only thing I would complain about. I am not a picky eater at all but I didn't care for too much here. We could only get one reservation and we got it our first night. We ate at the portofino which was ok, nothing too exciting. The rest of our meals we ate at the buffet and the pool grille. Breakfast and the buffet was definitly the best meal. I really enjoyed the omletts. Lunch was pretty much the same thing everyday at both places, but I loved the fries and hamburgers by the pool. Dinner was sometimes changed up a bit. When we asked a guy at the front desk if we were aloud to use the aztecs dining, he said no so we never made it over there. Drinks: The drinks were very good and I didn't think they were watered down. I liked the bar by the pool better than the bar in the lobby. Rooms: Nothing spectacular about them but considering the amount of time you spend in them it doesn't really matter. We were in the building by the pool, the older building. The room was very dark and the air conditioning was very loud because it was a unit. They didn't have drawers like everyone else said but they did have shelves right when you walked in where you could store stuff. I didn't think the beds were hard. The bathroom was spacious and the shower had good water pressure. Towels and washrags were always replaced everyday. Excursions/activities: We took a snorkeling excursion that we booked with our apple representive(the company we booked the trip with) It was half day but that was really enough time to see things. The hotel itself has so many things going on, that's done by the animation team. We took a tour on a catamaran, we kayaked, i played musical chairs and learned how to salsa dance and we participated in an archery competition. We saw a couple of shows (Madonna, battle of the sexes(so funny), and stars) for being a resort they were really well done. They also have beer competitions and a disco party every night. For the money this resort was very nice and I would recomend staying there. Don't go with high expectations and you'll have an awesome time.

It was a father & son trip for two weeks and we were looking forward to it with great anticipation. We viewed the hotel we would be staying at online and it looked and sounded wonderful. I read some reports on trip advisor and saw some warnings about the Viva Wyndham Maya, that I did not heed, to my regret. When we arrived at our hotel, the grounds looked beautiful, tropical jungle with the large fancy slate and tile entry. The problems started when we reached our room, which looked nothing like the one we had viewed online. The one we had seen online had beds with backboards and towels folded in the shape of fans and bath robes folded nicely for ones arrival. Our room had no backboards, no towels or robes and our bedside lamps were nothing but bare light bulbs. The picture on the wall was tilted and looked close to falling off the wall and to top that off there was large amounts of Mold (fungi ) on the ceiling and in the corners where the ceiling and walls joined. I spoke to the management there and was told they could not move me to another room as everything was booked, but they assured me they would fix things right away. After one week of our two week stay and over 6 visits to the manager nothing had been done to clean our room of Mold, our bedside lamps still had no shades and I set the picture straight myself. Being in Mexico most of ones time is not spent in their rooms and so onward. The food : The food looked good but for the most part was very bland, flavourless. The foods that should be hot were cold most of the time and this is when the restaurant first opened and one would expect things to be hot at least to start. The deserts looked nice yet they had the taste and texture of something made from a box. There are three a la carte restaurants which require a reservation. And you can only have three visits collectively per one week stay. They were OK but they ran out of supplies and some menu items where not available. The Viva Wyndham Maya also says they have Jet Skiing available, but they do not ! If you wish to do this you will have to go about 4 resorts down the beach and hopefully not wait to long. We waited just over one hour when the guy at our resort who takes you there said no problem to going right away. Money : If you take American Express travelers checks the hotel will charge you $2.00 USD for every $50.00 USD that you wish to cash in. And they will give you large bills when what you need there is small bills. For example cab fare in the hotel zone to 5th Avenue is $5.00. Also if you book an excursion through the hotel and use your visa they will say the price is so many USD but put the Visa through in pesos at a high exchange rate. When I got home and say that I was charged an average of $14.00 more than I should have I called Visa and they said next time have them write the amount in USD on the receipt and initial it, to avoid being over charged in this way. I could go on with other problems that we had at the Viva Wyndham Maya, but I think this should be enough for warning to help you with your decision. On a positive note : The Mexican people where wonderful and we enjoyed Mexico very much and plan to return again. The Mayan culture with it\u2019s archeological sites such as Chichen Itza, Coba and Tulum mixed with the Caribean ocean makes for a wonderful vacation destination. But we would never ! ! return to the Viva Wyndham Maya ever again. My advice is to avoid this establishment and seek accommodations elsewhere.

We had read reviews and knew what we were getting into. The Highs: great location! Small enough property that you didn't feel so crowded. Plenty of chairs on the beach - as long as you were willing to be be up by 5 a.m. to secure spots :) Clean property and interesting landscaping. The Lows: Food - there was plenty of it, but the quality was disappointing. For example: there was fresh salsa on the first night - and then never again for the whole week! No salsa at a Mexican resort for any meal? We were sad - even asked on more than one day - and were told \"no salsa\". Breakfast was good including made to order omelettes - but there was only one chef who made one omelette at a time and you needed to plan at least 15 minutes in line to get one. The salad bar was very simple - only ice berg lettuce, sometimes spinach, tomatos, cucumbers. You could search the rest of the stations and somtimes find carrots and other toppings. Getting reseverations at the good restaurants (3 maximum for a week stay) was a huge challenge. After waiting in line for 45 minutes the first morning, we could not get any reservations for the first 5 nights. We had let the hotel know well in advance we were celebrating a birthday and still couldn't get a restaurant for that night. After going back each morning for the first 4 days, we did secure some. The \"good\" restaurants were okay - Don Diegos was average Mexican fare - could have really had better deserts! The Miramar was the Italian Restaurant - it was pretty good - the best meals so far. Be careful, the Penne sauce is HOT! Again, the deserts were not good and we headed to find ice cream at the buffet before they closed. The beach restaurant food put out during the day was extremely redundant - the same exact items for 7 days straight! One thing we really wanted were ice cream type treats. Most days they had a small cooler (that you had to look to find) had popsicles only. A few nights they did have ice cream at the main buffet - but you had to get there quck or it was gone! They did have themes each night in the main buffet restaurant and some items - like the white fish and pasta bar were good. The main bar by the beach - including the swim up bar was under repair -during Easter week! It opened the last two days and was wonderful. The timing of the repairs seemed bad. The kitchen by the beach was also under repair for 4 days and the food was noticably better when it reopened. For us, the food wasn't make or break - but some members of our party really find food to be important and were sadly disappointed. The rooms: We had adjoining ocean front rooms which was nice. The rooms were clean and a decent size - but there are no dressers and you had to live out of a suitcase for the week. This would have been easier if you didn't have to have your suitcase on the floor! There was only one stand for a suitcase and not enough room on the counter which held the tv to put another one. The bathroom was fine - a very nice size, good shower with a shampoo dispenser in it. The towels were soft and large - but we intermittently had wash cloths and even when I searched 3 housekeeping carts in the hallway - could not find any more. I applaud the property for taking steps to eliminate the plastic waste that we experienced wtih other all inclusives for water bottles. They have water coolers on each floor and you fill your glasses or the one water bottle they leave in the room with that water. You cannot get water bottles anywhere else on the property. You have to find water coolers - and use the small glasses they provide. The safes in the room are differnet. One of our rooms had an electronic safe. the other still had an old safe and you had to go the front desk to get the lock/key to insert. The beach - after walking north and south - this is definitely the best feature of this hotel! The beach is very nice and they are working to build it up. It was a show to see the workers insert the water pump several times during the week into the water to pump up water/sand to build the beach. They are trying. As you will read in other reviews, all up and down the beach are sand bags to protect the shore. It is really sad to see what the hurricane destroyed. But this property has one of the best beaches - and the sand bags aren't too annoying. The hotel also does have a lifeguard. We also had many topless sunbathers every day at the property - which at first - provided the teen boys with something to look at - but then got old. If this is somethign that bothers you, this is not the property for you. We did find the bars to be very good and the bar tenders did not water down drinks. The kids did use the basketball court a lot, the ping pong table and went to the disco (which they said was \"lame\" except on Saturday night.) The activities people work very hard - not only to plan MANY activities during the day (and they aren't afraid to yell \"wakie wakie\" if you are napping at the beach) - bingo, spanish lessons, aqua gym, yoga, dance lessons, volleyball, Crazy games (we still aren't sure what those are). And then they turn around and put on a very big show each night. Themes included Grease, Latin dancing, Madonna, etc. They work very hard - dancing and such. And they \"visit\" with the guests throughout the day - just pull up to have a chat and find out about you/how the stay is going. We thought that was a nice touch. Excusions: The best day of the vacation - which happens to be the tagline of EdVentures - was a day of fun. We were picked up to go to Tulum, get outfitted with our snorkel gear at the EdVenture shop, swim in the cenotes, zipline, jump off a cliff into a deep lagoo at the Garden of Eden, snorkle in the ocean to see sea turtles feeding and THEN go to another lagoon to snorkle and see unbelievable brightly colored fish. 17 of us went on the excursio -with Carlose and Teo as our drivers - and Eddie popping in every now and then. All 17 people thought is was a GREAT day and didn't want it to end. Highly recommended! The costs were similar to some of the excusions offered through the hotel - but we were on OUR schedule and the timing kept us out of lines. Truly a fun fun day. We also took the ferry to Cozumel. We now call the ferry the \"barf boat\" because the seas were rocky - and when they start handing out purple bags once you are seated - it is a sign! I won't go into gross detail - but 1/3 of our party and dozens of people used the purple bags during our 40 minute ride. Once we got to Cozumel and took an hour to recoup on the pier - some tummies were really upset. We rented cars for about $45 each and headed to visit some beaches - Corona and The Money Bar restaurants that allow you to snorkel right off their property. It was fun. We also did the dolphin excursion within Chankanaab National park for our daughter's 12th birthday. She loved it. Renting the snorkels from the car rental place was less than 1/2 what it cost once you got to the restaurants/beaches. We did go into Playa Del Carmen twice - a very fun place. For a dinner, I asked local taxi drivers where they go to eat. They recommended El Fogon. About five blocks from the main strip - and a safe walk - 10 of us made the trip. We are so glad we did - it was a true experience versus a \"tourist\" spot. Many locals were eating there. The food was VERY good and they served your coca cola and such in cold glass bottles! The whole dinner for 12 with drinks was less than $80 US! It was another adventure and one that the 6 teens that were with us will remember. There you go...lots of detail that I hope is helfpul!", "Date": "April 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cOverall Fantastic Time!\u201d", "Author": "dms68", "ReviewID": "UR14538858", "Content": "My family of four (including two kids, 10 and 6) just returned from Wyndham Maya where we stayed from 3/17 - 3/22. All in all, we had a great vacation. Specifics: --Grounds, pool, beach: beautiful, they kept it very clean and well maintained. Beach was big enough, in my opinion, given their challenge of erosion. We walked down past some other resorts that didn't have as nice a beach as Wyndham Maya. Staff kept the pool and beach area spotless, there was always someone walking around picking up empty cups and sweeping. --Food: the buffet was fine for breakfast, it was just fair for lunch/ dinner. Fortunately we only had to have dinner there the first night, as I did my homework and knew to show up right as the reservation desk opened in the a.m. (actually a few minutes before it opens). We were able to get reservations at the Azteca for the first two nights and the Maya for the last two. The food and the service at the restaurants was first rate, with the exception of the Miramar at the Maya but that was mainly slow service and they missed a few food items we ordered (language barrier?). The restaurant meals were really, really good. One tip, please bring trousers/skirts to wear to the restaurants - they don't allow shorts! --The Rooms: Adequate. The first we were in (in the building by the main pool) had problems with the door, A/C and hot water (hot water issue was the whole building). Whenever we called for maintenance though, they did come quickly. The rooms in this building are older and very dark and the A/C is an individual unit in the room that is very loud. They probably need to look at renovating/upgrading, but given the amount of time you really spend in your room, I wouldn't let it be a show-stopper for me in choosing this resort. We did ask to move to an upgraded room if available, and there was after our second night so we moved to the building by the adult pool. This room was MUCH better. Slightly bigger, brighter, central A/C, mini fridge, dresser and bigger closets, bigger balcony, better sink/bath area, worth a four star rating for those rooms. --Staff: Absolutely phenomenal! From the bartenders to the maintenance staff to those keeping the pool/beach area clean, they were great. But special kudos to the activities staff. They were energetic (I think they put in 13-14 hour days), extremely friendly, upbeat, entertaining-- and especially the Kids Club Staff, which I couldn't get my six year old daughter out of! They were fantastic. Did activities with the kids all day long. There were tons of things for everyone to do-- my 10 year old didn't do kids club but found a bunch of kids his age poolside to play basketball, ping-pong, water polo, fuzball, etc. The staff also put on fairly entertaining nightly shows, one of which my daughter got to participate in (Disney Kids). It's not Broadway, but they do a good job and everyone has fun. --Overall, I would say that the staff at Viva Wyndham Maya and the activities they offer make up for what the rooms (some of them lack. I would especially recommend this place for people with kids. Please do follow the recommendations for restaurant reservations (show up early!), and please do go with realistic expectations about the rooms in particular. Basic but adequate (yes, the beds are a little hard). Ask for an upgrade, if they have it, they'll probably give it to you.

First of all, the place is extra clean and it goes for the rooms too. Whenever we needed something (towels, toilet paper) it was taken care of immediately and with a smile. Which brings us to the quality of the staff, I never said hello so much time in my life.Every staff member you cross path with always greet you with a smile or a hola(hello) and it seemed sincere and not forced. Quite a change from the coldness of the city sometimes. The young staff who took care of the activities was quite extraordinary too, they're very dynamic and always try to make you participate in the activities of the hotel (without insisting). They're also a big part of the shows at night and they 're very talented. I also liked the food, the buffet gives a great variety of food from breakfast to supper ,I found fish, chicken, mexican food, beef , pork and pasta at every dinner and supper, also a great variety of fruits and vegetables. The only thing is the dinner and supper are almost the same but you can take your dinner near the beach at the little snack-bar who offers pizza, tacos, burgers and hot-dogs. It's a good idea to reserve your 3 A la carte as soon as possible, we did it the day after we arrived and had no problem reserving what we wanted. I like the Italian best because they cooked my steak to perfection, but the other 2 we're also very good. Some people said that the pool is too small, but what's the problem? I've been there a week and there always been more than enough room to swim. My biggest complain is the beach area, it's too small and if you want to have a decent place to stay during the day, you have to put your towels on a chair at about 6:00 am. Also, when we were there, the space was limited to go in the water because they were doing some maintenance on our beach but it was getting better day by day. It didn't affect me that much, I went to the beach on the left of our hotel to take a dip, it was bigger and a lot of space. By the way, the color of the sea around noon is marvelous with all kind of shades of green and blue. So a great hotel, very friendly , practical, quiet at night and a great decor. I recommend it without any hesitation and I would go back anyday.", "Date": "March 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prairies", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort for the money\u201d", "Author": "WesternCanada", "ReviewID": "UR14340498", "Content": "We stayed at Viva Maya March 8-15th. A tip right off the bat. When you clear customs and immigration in Cancun, you walk through the doors to all of the timeshare people. They try to take your luggage and direct you to one of their \u2018agents\u2019 to the left of the door you exit from who offer to take you to your hotel. Don\u2019t be fooled! Just tell them you have transportation to your hotel through the travel agency and keep walking. They can be ruthless. Unless you are serious about buying a timeshare DO NOT waste your time talking with these people! If you get there at a decent time of day an option is taking a cab if you don\u2019t mind paying extra. That was our original plan but since we arrived late at night there really wasn\u2019t a big hurry to get to the hotel. We cleared customs at around 11:00 but didn\u2019t make it to the hotel until around 1:30 in the morning as they stopped at all the other hotels dropping off people first. The cabs say the price is $82 but I got them to $65 with no effort. You would make it to the hotel a lot quicker doing it this way and get a good start on your vacation. Just tell the Tour guide you will be doing it so they don\u2019t wait around looking for you to get on the bus. The tour bus we were on through SunWing had corona for 3$ USD so that was alright. It started our vacation off right. Rooms. Check in was fast as there were only a handful of us and my wife and I were put in the new area. The room was basic but very clean and adequate. The new wing has central a/c so no noise from window a/c that other people in the older part complained about. We tipped the maids daily and had a good supply of towels and our room was clean by mid morning. Our room had a fridge, coffee pot, iron, blow dryer\u2026.basically everything you would need. The beds were hard though. Beach. The beach was nice but eroded which didn\u2019t really matter because there were enough lounge chairs for everyone. Very few people actually put towels on the sand as there are a lot of people walking along the beach. Getting a spot under the shaded huts was a different story but it didn\u2019t concern us as we were there to be in the sun. The sand is white and very fine, almost like a powder. Pools. We never spent any time by the pool but the bar was right there so you had quick access to a drink. The adult pool never seemed to be crowded whenever we walked by it to go to the room. If you plan on staying by the pool, take a thermal cup to keep your drink cold. Thermal cups hold more alcohol than the cups they give you therefore fewer trips up to the bar. We brought some but never used them because I was too lazy to walk over to the bar from the beach. Food. I\u2019m not sure why people complained about the food as there was enough of a variety to please everyone and we found it to be above expectations. We did an all inclusive in Varadero, Cuba a few years back and that food was horrible. The food was a definite plus. The house wine they had was brutal but we survived. Anyway we were quite happy with the selections for breakfast, lunch and dinner. If you want to book with the ala cartes you have to stand in line at 8:00 am to book the restaurants but we couldn\u2019t be bothered as the lineups were long. We booked later in the morning when the lineups were short but only got into 2 ala cartes for the week. Others got into all three but whatever. We ate at Portofina and it was good. We had a booking for Don Diego but ended up cancelling. Other people said you can show up and ask if there are cancellations and flash a 10 and could get in. The grill by the pool was ok and served burgers,fries, hotdogs etc. You would never go hungry between the buffets. We never did go to Azteca to eat but talked to a couple from there who were eating at our resort and they said our resort was nicer and better food. We ate in Playa a few times and it was excellent. I read on this site about a must do restaurant called Alux (pronounced Aloosh) in Playa that was in a cave. It was a good experience and the atmosphere was great especially if you have never experienced something like this before however you are definitely paying for the novelty of eating in a cave. We ordered the $65.00 platter and it was not worth it. I was embarrassed for them and quite disappointed for what you got. I do recommend visiting this restaurant but for drinks only though. The cab ride from the hotel was $8.00. Oh yeah, you are supposed to have a reservation and we didn\u2019t but getting in wasn\u2019t a problem. Drinks: Here\u2019s a little tip that\u2019s gold. Just because the premium alcohol sat on the back bar doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have it. Just ask for it. Why drink the domestic slop when you can have the good stuff. Just don\u2019t forget to tip the bartenders. I found that tipping a dollar every couple of rounds made the staff remember what you drank and some would ever pour my drinks along with the people in front of me. Entertainment: We checked out a couple of the shows in the evening and they were entertaining especially when they had members of the audience up there to make fools of themselves. We never made it to the Disco. Three kids later I guess were past that stage in life. Excursions: We went to Xel-ha and it was great. Saw a lot of iguanas and other local wildlife. One thing to be aware of when snorkeling is you can get quite sea sick depending on where you go in the park. We were by the floating bridge near the outlet to the ocean and it was a bit rougher water and since we were wearing life jackets the constant bobbing in the water made us both feel rather sick. We saw a lot of amazing fish along with a barracuda and a couple of sting rays. Bring a disposable underwater camera. I bought mine from Walmart for 8 bucks. They want around 15 dollars there. DO NOT buy the junk underwater digitial camera from Walmart. It is pure junk. Buy the disposable. Also I read how people had problems with not having eco friendly sunscreen and that they had theirs confiscated by the park. We never had any issues with this as nobody checked our bags. I did buy their sunscreen for 17 dollars but never even used it so don\u2019t feel you need to buy any especially if you aren\u2019t going to tan. I bought the Xel-Ha tickets online from the website before we left and the cost was 67.50 per person all inclusive. You can book tours down there but the cost was 129.00 per person which included transportation. We took a 5 dollar cab ride into Playa to the Colectivo area and took one at a cost of 20 ($2.00)pesos per person for the whole 40km ride. I believe a cab ride would have cost 34 dollars each way. They drop you off at the entrance so you have to walk about 600 metres which wasn\u2019t an issue. When we left we walked to the highway and there was a colectivo there already which took us back. If you wait till the park closes they are usually waiting at the park so you wouldn\u2019t have to walk to the highway. There are a ton of them going up and down the highway so you won\u2019t have to wait long for one. If they have room they will flash their lights and just wave and they stop. Total cost was 74 dollars per person, a lot cheaper than going the tour route. This would be the way to go if a whole family was going. I highly recommend doing it this way as all the locals use this method of transportation and we got to see where some of them lived off the beaten path when they got dropped off. Not the greatest conditions to live in but it was neat to see. If anyone is planning to go to Tulum which is a little farther away the cost is still only 20 pesos. These colectivos run from Tulum to Cancun. When we took it back they dropped us off back in Playa where we got on which is 1 block from 5th avenue. By the way these vans are new and air conditioned. Shopping: What\u2019s nice about this hotel is it is close to the shopping in Playa. It\u2019s about a 20 minute walk to get to 5th avenue where all the shopping is. Take a pair of running shoes. We walked in daily to look around and took a cab back for 50 pesos. Always pay in pesos as they quote you the price in US dollars (5) but by paying in pesos (50) you actually save money as the exchange is closer to 11 pesos per dollar which works out to about 50 cents cheaper. Not much but we took a lot of cab rides during the week. 5th avenue shopping is about 10 or so blocks long and is more expensive than going a couple of streets up but almost everything from the vendors can be bargained down to almost half of asking price. They more or less have the same items for sale so don\u2019t buy at the first place as everyone has a different asking price. We never took a lot of money with us because there are ATM\u2019s everywhere so we just withdrew when we need it and you get the best rate that way. They do charge 7.50 for each withdraw so we took a couple thousand (200 dollars) pesos out each time. Just by going up Benito Juarez street (the first major street intersecting 5th avenue) a couple of blocks the prices were way cheaper. We bought our rum for home at a little corner store for 8 dollars where as they charge anywhere from 12-15 dollars on 5th. Just know that by going away from 5th you are heading more into the locals domain and there aren\u2019t too many tourists around but never the less we never had any problems\u2026Maybe do this during the day only. Walmart was a big disappointment as the prices there for clothing was really no different than back home. You can pick up the tourist attraction t-shirts like Chichen-itza there for about 9 dollars and I assume if you buy them at Chichen-Itza they would be a lot more. The prices at the plaza across from the hotel is A LOT more than buying from the vendors in Playa and is the same stuff. Final thoughts: The whole experience was better than expected for a 3 \u00bd star rating. It is definitely worth the price we paid of 1050.00 taxes included. If you\u2019re expecting to be treated like a king then go pay the big bucks and visit a 5 star. Not that this experience was substandard by any means. The staff were very friendly however do remember that they are there to earn a living and even though it\u2019s all inclusive they do appreciate getting a tip. Even for people on a budget I highly recommend putting money aside to tip the staff. You would be surprised at the kind of service you get by doing this. I would go back there again.

We had a great time. We, like many, were concerned by the mixed reviews this resort had received. However, we're very glad we chose to listen to the positive reviews. We stayed from Feb.23-Mar.1, 2008. The weather was good, but cool some days. The cool days were good for walking to Playa del Carmen(20 min) and taking excursions. Resort/Staff Very friendly and accommodating. Greeted with tequila sunrises...so we're off to a great start! Room We had room 3202 in the newest building by the relax pool(adult pool). This was great because it was quiet. We left the kids at home so I really appreciated having quiet space. The room was basic but very clean. We had everything we needed. Bureau for clothes, TV, iron, ironing board, blow dryer, shampoo. Alarm clock didn't work, but that's what wakeup calls are for. We tipped the housekeeping staff $5.00usd/day. In return, we always had plenty of towels and cute towel animals on the bed. We used the laundry service, but it took 2 days to get our clothes back. (1 day Mexico time, I believe). We could have had a coffee maker if we had asked. In hindsight, if you don't have one in your room, ask. There doesn't seem to be any coffee or tea before 6:30am. Beach Despite the sandbags, one of the best in the area. They are working hard to reclaim the beach. I didn't feel the rock-like sandbags detracted too much. It's just a shame the whole area lost so much beachfront. The winds and surf are rather strong this time of year. Fine for my boyfriend, who is a strong swimmer, but I had some difficulty with it...no matter, nothing a boogie board couldn't fix. He went out on the catamaran and kayak on the one day the surf permitted. I would have liked to, but, as luck would have it, the surf didn't afford me a second opportunity. Didn't have a problem with getting a beach chair but that's because we were up at sunrise everyday. By 7:30am, many of the chairs were taken. During the day, vendors walk up and down the beach selling silver, tattoos, time shares, excursions, easy enough to ignore, only mildly irritating. The morning exercise classes were very loud at the northern end of the beach, but the south end was much quieter. Pools We didn't spend much time in the main pool, other than to try out the pool bar - nice novelty. The pool is cooler than the surf. We spent several late afternoons at the adult pool in the jacuzzi with drink in hand. Met many wonderful people like Fenway and family and Christine. Great place to make new friends! All the pools were very clean. Bar staff were always very friendly. Very relaxing! Food Again, as others have reported, difficult to get reservations. Get to the desk as soon as you can. (across from the check-in counter). Reservations start at 8am, be there at 7:45am. The lineup builds quickly. You can book at both the Maya and Azteca. We found the Miramar to be the best. This surprised us, since based on what we saw on the Wyndham home site, we thought we'd like this the least. The Mexican (Don Diego) was second and we weren't particularly impressed with the Portofino. We were able to get reservations at all three plus the Mayan restaurant at the Azteca. We missed our reservation at the Mayan (fell asleep). On the 4th day, we checked and there was a cancellation at the Don Diego, so we ate there twice. On the fifth day, we went into Playa del Carmen for dinner. We found a sports bar across from the SUR Argentinian Steakhouse. Three hockey games were broadcast, Habs vs Sabres, TO vs Tampa and Canucks vs CBJ. Dos cervezas por favor! We then went to SUR for 25oz steak and prawns plus 12oz steak $100us for both of us including drinks. Great dinner. The buffet at Viva was great for breakfast and lunch, but mediocre for dinner. The salmon was good. However, a very limited dinner menu. The bbq hamburgers and bbq chicken were very good at the snack bar, when they were bbqing. The regular junk food was mediocre. Drinks are weak, which was fine with me since I was drinking all day. Ask for a double if you need to taste the alcohol. The free wine was dreadful. I wasn't about to pay for expensive wine at an all inclusive. Entertainment Shows - good, but funny to see staff lip syncing to \"Grease Lightning\" without knowing the words. The staff obviously worked very hard and their energy levels were incredible. These guys must not have a life outside the resort. Night club - opened at 10:30pm too late for us sunrisers. We heard it was fun. Hired entertainers - Mariachi lovely Activities: Fitness, games, cooking class, bocci ball, ping pong, ceramics, kayaking, catamaran, boogie board, archery, climbing wall - all fun. Excursions We booked with Sunwing. The first day, the rep Marcos came and did an orientation at 9am. We booked deep sea fishing - wrong season no marlin..caught Trigger fish. Not edible, barbless hooks, downrigger, no challenge, but, we fished. Next time we'll come after May for Marlins. Dolphin Discovery - Disappointing. Herded in, processed through, herded to purchase pictures. It was very windy so the water was very turbid. We couldn't see the sharks or stingrays in the other tanks. The sole purpose of the exercise seemed to be to get photo ops with the dolphins, who themselves were great, but one wondered who was being trained - us or them. Ok for kids but if the water is rough, I wouldn't recommend this adventure. Rather book the Xcaret or Xel-ha. Summary All in all a great vacation. Go with an open mind and relax. What goes on in Mexico...stays in Mexico. Highlights Beach, bars, cleanliness of rooms and grounds, friendly staff, Zoom Airlines delayed by 14hrs - resort put us up for extra day and night no charge. Doesn't get much better than that! Low Lights Reservation process (tho' I'm told 5stars no better), Sunwing excursions Watch out for time share sellers in the airport - they'll try to hook you before you see the light of day.

One review suggested we ask for an upgrade in the \u2018newer\u2019 building on the resort, so that\u2019s what I did the night I arrived. The person at the front desk was pleasant and happy to help. They put us on a list and suggested that we come back the next day at 1 PM to ask for the upgrade since they would know then if there was any availability \u2013 fair. The next day at 2 PM we visited the front desk and asked for the room upgrade. The person working at the front desk that day (again, very pleasant), checked the list, saw our room number and told us that they indeed had another room available for us! I was so happy. She even told me I could go check it out before I decided to change rooms. When we entered the new building and our new soon-to-be room, it was AMAZING! VERY clean, VERY modern, VERY big! This building is better kept than the older building. It\u2019s for VIP guests (which we weren\u2019t), but we got very lucky. The room was beautiful, it contained: a big balcony, a couch/living room area, king size comfortable bed, TV, fridge that was stocked (only for 2 nights though), a jacuzzi, an open window-style view from the bathroom looking into the bedroom, a standup shower, 2 sinks, a private room for the toilette, and central air. It was perrrfect. Best room I\u2019ve ever had, and I would rate the room a 5-star. Make sure you try asking for a room upgrade, we told another couple on the resort about our luck and they did the same and they got an upgrade too! So it\u2019s not too tough. We enjoyed our room very much! BEACH: Nice beach. Hurricane damage is evident hence the sandbags. They weren\u2019t fun to look at, but the resort has to do this to save their beach! It was still beautiful and relaxing. Easy to get a chair, and find space. Everyone on the beach was friendly, nobody bothered you, a few sales people but if you didn\u2019t look at them, they didn\u2019t look at you. POOL: Didn\u2019t spend much time here, but the pool was clean, water was very warm and the swim-up bar was nice. There is a second private adult\u2019s pool with its own bar in the new building area. RESTAURANTS: 3 \u00e1 la cartes: Mexican, Italian and Mediterranean. Unlike other reviews, we had no problems getting anything booked; we were able to book all restaurants easily. We arrived on a Friday and did so on the Saturday afternoon. We only ate at the Italian one b/c we were off the resort the other times and had to cancel the other two reservations. The Italian restaurant was good! Not filling enough for someone with a big appetite as the portions were small, but it was much better than the buffet \u2013 much better. You can also eat at the sister resort Wyndham Azteca and you can utilize their \u00e1 la cartes as well. The Azteca is a 5 minute walk from the Viva resort and the buffet there is much much much better. BUFFET RESTAURANT: Breakfast was good. Lunch and dinner was terrible. The selection was not good and the food was not fresh and tasty. I have nothing good to say about the buffet. Fruits and dessert was good I suppose. But the drinks were warm the main course meals were not good at all. I suggest you eat your buffet meals at the Azteca as their buffet is much better, fresher, better variety, changes everyday. One night they had sushi. SNACK BAR: Lots of junk: pizza, hamburgers, hotdogs, French fries, nachos. Everything was good here; you really can\u2019t go too wrong with junk food. This bar is supposed to be open until very late, but one night we arrived late on the resort (not past closing hours) and the cook refused to make us anything even though he was there cooking food for himself and his friends! We were not impressed by this and complained, but that got us nowhere either. The pizza at the snack bar at Azteca was much better and they were better stalked. DO NOT eat the non-junk food at the sack bar (rice, meats, pasta, etc.). It\u2019s the buffet food brought over to the snack bar and who knows how old it is. That might be why some people got sick. TOWN OF PLAYA DEL CARMEN: Transportation: - It\u2019s a 5 minute cab ride and it costs 50 pesos each way. What to do: - Great little town, lots going on, lots of shops and you can bargain! Holding pesos makes bargaining more easy. Take a walk in the town and enjoy. - Eat there! Great meal deals, especially seafood. My boyfriend and I enjoyed an amazing grilled seafood platter dinner which included 3 lobster tails, crab claws, calamari, shrimps, octopus, fish filet, potatoes, salad, veggies and a bottle of wine for $65 US dollars! There is a lot of selection with different prices. The seafood is made very well. I don\u2019t suggest the steak \u2013 it\u2019s not prime quality meat as we are used to. - Club- Goers!!! We went to the clubs every night almost! Good mix of music, crowd is 19-35. Very loungy. Some clubs have ladies night where you drink free and have free cover. Blue Parrot was the BEST club there \u2013 it\u2019s on the beach! The cost there is $10 US, but you get 2 beers free with entry. Good house music and top 40. Lots of after hours places too, just ask! - I do not recommend the club \u2018boly\u2019, a bartender there slipped a drug in my boyfriend\u2019s drink and he passed out, it ruined our night. The drink was meant for me (ladies night), but i gave it to him. Please watch your drinks when they are being made. FINAL REMARKS/SUMMARY: - Request a room in the newer building \u2013 you never know, you may get lucky! - Make use of the resort Azteca for their a la cartes and their buffet \u2013 much much better food!!! Better snack bar as well. - Go into town and try the seafood dinners. - Do not go to the club \u2018boly\u2019 \u2013 again, my boyfriend was drugged there, the drug was meant for me, it was most likely the date rape drug. Very dangerous.

Some people recommended we tip to have better room, we simply asked first and got it - we still gave her $100 pesos for her kindness. ROOM: basic two-queen beds, small table in between, mini fridge in the closet along with a safe (free). No dresser to put clothes in though. Bathroom clean and simple but shower had low water pressure. Balcony with amazing ocean view and pool view, small but enough room for two chairs and small table. BEACH; one of the best in the area apart from the last hotel south the Sandos Playacar who has no sandbags at all. The sand is white and powdery and the water is blue and clear!! Sandbags run perpendicular to the beach but there is a lot of room to swim. POOLS: one adult only by the entrance of the resort with it's own bar and one by the ocean with bar, pool bar, snack bar. Very very clean pools. The snack bar by the ocean pool is partly covered by an upstairs restaurant (Miramar) so you get shade if you want to. RESTAURANTS; 3 a la cartes at the Maya and 3 at the sister hotel, the Azteca - most were good to very good - you are given 3 reservations for you own hotel and the rest you must book the same day starting at 8am in the lobby. I got there at 7:20 with my book!! So we enjoyed 5 restaurants in our 7 days - we cancelled one to enjoy downtown Playa del Carmen one evening. BUFFET: good food, limited selection compared to a Riu or Iberostar - but still lots to chose: pasta bar, salad bar, meats, cheeses, great omelets, breads etc.... SNACK BAR AT THE BEACH: Hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza, fruit, great fries, some meats etc.... had to wait a lot of times for the pizza, fries and burgers but hey you're in Mexico....relax. ENTERTAINMENTS: The kids put on good shows, they work super hard!!! everynight at the theatre by the ocean pool. HIGHLIGHTS: My boys spent most of their days with the young men in charge of the kids' club. Their names were Elias, Oscar and Pollo - great bunch and they were great with the kids and this is by far the best memories my boys took away from this trip. We have wonderful pictures of them and everyonw was crying when we had to leave. We have extended our invitiation to them to come to Canada and visit anytime!! LOWLIGHTS: please be careful swimming along those sandbags we witnessed a near-drowning of a approx. 30 year old man who was saved by the lifeguard. I will never forget this highly dramatic scene.....I was in tears until they found him underneath the water.....I will never forget that lifeguard - people were hugging him and all. SUMMARY: Great hotel for the value - if you want 5* amenities and service and perfect beach with no erosion or sandbags look elsewhere but if you want clean, good food, great service at a decent price this is the place!!!

Loved the area, but wasn't too happy with our first all inclusive experience. Check-in and our rooms were fine, and the beach was beautiful. Our only complaint, but it's a big one, was the food. We are not foodies or big eaters, but given what you are spending, this was a huge disappointment, and we spent extra money in order to avoid eating at the hotel. The buffets are all the same every day, and there is little on them that is truly edible. Once you've found the one or two things that are okay, that means you are stuck eating the same food every day. We heard from people staying at an Iberostar that the food at their buffet changed, with different theme nights each night (Italian, Mexican, etc.). But not here. We also did an all-inclusive day at Xel-ha, a snorkeling/swimming park, and even there the food was a million times better. The ala carte restaurants were the most frustrating part. Not ever having stayed at an all-inclusive, we didn't know the drill. We got to the reservations desk, which opened at 8, around 8:20. We got in the long line to make reservations, and by the time we got our chance, we were told most reservations were taken. We were only able to get reservations for two of our five nights, one at 9:30 and one at 7:30. None were available at the Azteca, which we were supposed to be able to eat at as well. Yet if you go to any of the restaurants during prime eating time, only 20% of the tables are filled. I'm sure some of that is due to people not using the reservations they are forced to make so early in the week. We were told by one vacationer that if you go to the restaurant and make a stink, they will seat you. We tried that at two of the restaurants with no results. We then went to the front desk and made a big stink, and they finally told us we could go to Portofino and eat there. (My husband, who is as mild-mannered as they come and not the one who speaks up in these situations, made the scene, and I was actually quite proud of him. Very out of character.) The service at the restaurants was very nice, but the food was just okay, although better than the buffet. One other comment: The beach is beautiful, but crowded, with every chair taken by late morning. Also, it is very difficult to find shade, as people claim the Palapas very early in the morning. The water was wondeful, and the beach was somewhat windy with huge waves. We were told by the snorkeling guide there that this happens this time of year (their winter), but in the summer it is calm as a lake. Now that we know the area, we're excited to go back, but next year we're renting a beachfront condo.", "Date": "March 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NH", "Title": "\u201cGreat Fun!\u201d", "Author": "chlotam", "ReviewID": "UR14078909", "Content": "The Viva Maya is great.

The food was great at the buffet and the a la cartes. It was hard to get into the a la cart restaurants, but if you insist on a day and time you will get in. The omelets at the buffet were awesome! The staff was all around fabulous-always smiling and trying to engage you in conversation! OK now for the only problem...The palapa nightmare!!!! We had three arguments with people over palapas in 8 days. I put my towels on chairs under a palapa each morning (around 5AM). One day a man came up and accused my sister and husband of moving his books off chairs. They disagreed and argued a bit, then he moved to the next palapa and said the same thing to the next couple.

After reading some of the reviews, we were a tad apprehensive about booking this resort. After our stay, I'm not sure what people have to complain about other than the fact they feel they should complain. The hotel staff are friendly, the grounds are beautiful, the rooms are adequate - although I do agree with the other reviews about the beds - very hard. (And don't be surprised by the red ants in the toilet bowl each night. A simple flush, takes care of the situation) The buffet for breakfast is very good - lots of options. We didn't dine in the main dining area for lunch - we always chose the pool area grill, which is very limited in selection, but very good. Dinners at the buffet were also very good. The three restaurants that you need reservations for are overrated, with the exception of Portofina, the Italian restaurant - it was the best meal, by far, of the vacation. The one complaint with this resort would be the drinks. The drinks are very weak and not well mixed. After several days of trying to find 'the perfect mix' I had to resort to coconut rum on ice with a slice of lime...The wines at the resort are substandard. You need to either purchase bottles of wine in the market across the street or order a bottle (which you need to pay for) at dinner. That was very disappointing. Do beware of trying to get lounge chairs on the beach. Even when you get up early and mark your chairs with the customary towel, folks remove the towels and take over your cabana. We were there for nine days and had three 'cabana encounters'. Not to worry, you just need to stand your ground with the folks who have taken over your seat and they'll go away and you'll have your cabana back! The kids club is fabulous. The crew are always happy to see your child and you can drop the kids off for an hour, a half day, or whole day - no matter to the staff - they're always happy to see your children and the kids have a wonderful time.

I booked this vacation for 3 couples and I was very apprehensive of what we may find from reading some of these reviews. We arrived the 23rd and made sure we booked our ala cartes the following morning right at 8am. We were lucky to get 3 ala cartes for 6 people and the food in the restaurants was amazing! Our rooms were very nice (oceanview King size beds) and towels were left everyday if we requested a change of towels. On day 3 our sheets were changed. Fridge was stocked daily and water was always plentiful in the hallway water container. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and very well kept. The covered pathway was a nice touch, especially at night. The staff were amazing and having no spanish language training at all was no problem. Plenty of them spoke good english. You just have to remember that you are in another country where english is definately not the prominent language. If you want to relax, you can relax. If you want to dance the night away you could do that at the disco. If you want to play tennis or go the gym for a work out - no problem. I feel that this resort had everything that you could possibly need. It was close to the Playa Car shopping centre and only a $5 cab ride to 5th Ave. A must go destination. We walked over to the Azteca for breakfast one morning and were not as impressed. The resort is smaller and the breakfast buffet was not as plentiful as the Maya. Though it is nice to have the option of going back and forth if you wanted to. We walked along the beach and the Maya has probably the nicest beach there. They all have sandbags, but our sandbags were placed in a way that allowed people to still swim in the water. My only complaint from this resort would be some of the other vacationers.

This is my 3rd all inclusive resort (Cuba 2006 and Dominican 2007) and I was very pleased with everything. The rooms were very clean, the resort grounds were constantly groomed and well maintained. The Bars were well stocked with international name liquors like Appleton Jamaican Rum, Smirnoff Vodka, Jim Beam Whisky to name a few. The swim up bar was great just wished there was a bit of shade there. Juan who bartended the swim up bar was definetly \"on the ball\" and was very friendly. They have a nice selection of mixed tropical drinks. The Buffet was great. There was a good selection of authentic mexican food, but I was a little dissapointed that there wasn't too much salsa or guacamole. It is a typical buffet for a 4 star resort for anyone that does any traveling. The al a cartes were very nice. Beautiful restaurants and tasty 4 and 5 course meals. Just make sure you BOOK THEM ASAP!! I know this from my previous vacations that they go fast, and they do. The nightly Entertainment was well put together. I am not a big fan of musicals or plays but that was the themes for the most part and they were enjoyable. The beach has a lot of sand bags that sort of resemble beach whales, but I still found the beach to be beautiful and fun to walk or to have fun in the beautiful ocean water. The downtown shopping on 5th Avenue (main street) was a lot of fun to see and for bartering some fine deals. You can usually talk them down to roughly 75% off their asking price, they think everyone who goes on vacation is rich. I however found the best deals on your booze to take home to be at the walmart a few blocks away from 5th ave. Taxis are cheap, like $5 each way so getting around is not expensive. The resort had people from all walks of life, young couples, families and older people and all seemed very pleased. There are 2 pools on the resort to cater to your mood, quiet or more up beat. The resort does not stay alive too late, I found most people went to bed early but I found that to be ok.

I think if you just want to have a fun, relaxing vacation and don't set your standards way too high, this is a great place for you. I did find the front desk staff to be a bit rude, which is my only complaint, so if you have anything wrong with your room, i would think you would have to bug them quite a bit to get anything fixed, however, we had nothing wrong with our room. We had 2 queen sized beds, which i didn't find rock hard. I noticed everyone seems to be commenting on this, but i did not find them hard. It is true there are no dressers, but there are shelves to put your clothes if you feel the need to unpack everything for a week.

The food at all three is EXCELLENT! (And i'm a vegetarian and i still had lots to eat at all 3) We asked the staff why the restaurants were always half full, and they said it's because they only have a limited number of seatings each night, they just have way too many tables than the chef can handle at once. So do make reservations early. The buffet was also great! There is mostly the same food there every day but they do try to switch things up for everyone as well. The pasta bar was my favorite, definitely try this! And breakfast was so good! The food by the pool is mostly greasy fries/burgers/pizza, so go to the buffet unless you want this everyday. The beach was great, there are big sandbags but I didn't find they got in the way of swimming. And i managed to find chairs late in the afternoon when i went out, but it is packed.

Entertainment staff are awesome and obviously love their jobs. Waiters in buffet area are so amazing. They only make $6.00 a day so PLEASE tip them well. They work so hard to please you. Just got back today. Stayed 2 weeks (feb 8 -22nd) Room 2120 : 2 double rock hard beds, terrible pillows, no towels, no soap, no bar fridge or dresser so had to live out of suitcases for 2 weeks. Air conditioner was so loud that you couldn't hear the crappy TV. If you tip the cleaning lady (and please do) ask her for more than one towel per person. Beach & pool area very nice, but you have to put out your beach towels before 6:30am. I suggest you bring your own thin beach towels to distinguish from the blue towels. Shade very hard to get after 6:30am. Very windy on beach so don't be fooled that you are not getting burnt and make sure you use sunscreen. Lot's of red bodies on second day. Food: Average at best. I got chicken that was raw on the inside. Best bet at the buffet is meat or fish being grilled on the spot. Pasta bar is busy but really good. If you see a grey looking pool of sauce, it is their seafood and it is great. Beach food area is frustrating because they don't have enough burgers or pizza available during the rush. Restaurants: All good. BUT almost impossible to get a reservation. Why? Good question because each restaurant was almost empty every night. My take is that it's cheaper for them to have people eat at the buffet so they just don't bother filling the restaurants to capacity. (scam) Excursions: Xa Ha: Great place to go, lot's to see and do. If you are thinking of swimming with the dolphins, do it here. Pay the extra cost instead of taking a different excursion which will cost you more. Have a thrill and jump off the cliff. Worst excursion is the Sunwing to Isle of the Women (can't remember the Spanish name) 12 hour day for 45 min of a good time. Ugly island nothing to see. Just skip this one. XCaret: Didn't go but everyone who went raved about it, especially the show at night. Tulum best bet for seeing ruins but very hot and you have to walk a lot. Very little shade. This was the most frustrating trip I have ever taken and definately only a 3 star (unless you are a time share owner) If this is the best you can afford then I really hope you have a great time.", "Date": "February 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Alberta", "Title": "\u201cThe ant saga\u201d", "Author": "JerWen", "ReviewID": "UR13763808", "Content": "We have compared this stay to others we have had in the past and would definitely not recommend this resort. We just came back from a week at the Viva Maya Feb. 14 - 21/08 Initially we checked in to our room without difficulty and were pleased to find a ground level room right next to the outdoor theater. Shortly thereafter, we discovered many ants in the bathroom. We immediately went to the front desk and asked to be reassigned to another room. We were told our names would be put on the list for a change of room and it would take 2 days. They told us they would send someone to spray the ants. By the next morning, no one had come to get rid of the pests so we went back to the front desk and asked again about a new room. We were told that our name had not been placed on the list so it would be another 2 days. They would send someone to spray the ants. After the 3rd day, we went to see the new room and once again it was on the ground floor but a considerable distance away from the rest of the resort. We told them that we didn't want to be difficult so if they would actually send someone to get rid of the ants we would stay where we were as we had already spent 1/2 of our vacation dealing with the ants. We were assured they would make this a priority. That night, water began seeping up a drain in our bathroom leaving a disgusting sewage smell in our room. We once again went to the front desk and reported the problem and requested a new room immediately . We were told it would take 2 days but they would send someone to check it. Is this sounding funny yet?? After about 1 hour we returned to the desk and asked it anyone was coming as it was now midnight and we wanted to turn in. They did send someone about 20 minutes later who put a plunger on the drain - pushed on it a few times and cleaned up the floor with a bit of toilet paper. He said he would return the next day to check it but never did come back. No one ever came to deal with the ants We were pleased with the soft pillows only to find that on the 3rd day someone else in the resort had probably requested soft pillows and we found ours taken and we were left with pillows that were rock hard and only about 1 inch high. We had heard of other hotels that stocked fridges with water and soft drinks but were only left 1 bottle of water on the first day and were to fill it from the water dispensers on the 2nd floor. We did not appreciate the cleaning staff rearranging our personal belongings. We tried to book the a la carte restaurants but were only able to book an 8:30 p.m. and a 9:00 p.m. reservation in two of them. We had our last dinner in the Italian restaurant interupted by someone wanting us to fill in a survey about our stay. The food however in the Italian restaurant was excellent we were pleased to discover. Lastly the buffet - where to start?? Breakfast was the best . We enjoyed the pastries and fresh fruit. Lunch and supper were the same - every day nothing changed. The snack bar was also the same - every day nothing changed. We asked at the guest services desk about eating at the Viva Aztec as we had wanted to walk there for lunch. We were told that we could only use the a la carte Restaurant there but the buffet and bar were off limits. We found that this information was not correct. Make sure you ask several people or other travelers in order to get accurate information. We found as other reports indicate that you must get an early wake up call in order to save chairs on the beach. The beach itself was excellent, the staff other than the front end staff were courteous and friendly, the a la carte Restaurants were good, there was hot water. So all in all we didn't let this resort spoil our vacation and came back home with some fantastic memories but will really really trust the feed back on this web site next time we check out a resort.", "Date": "February 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver", "Title": "\u201cso so viva\u201d", "Author": "liquidsunVancouver", "ReviewID": "UR13720285", "Content": "My family of four(mom,dad & two girls) stayed at the Viva Maya from Feb.8-15 2008. We used SUNWING as our tour operator. We have stayed at other 4* resorts in the past so this review has our past stays as comparison. The resort is smaller than it's neighbors. It is clean . Security is suspect. There was an ugly incident between visitors over beach chairs. Two older ladies were physically assaulted by a man from another party .The ladies felt management let them down. The best things about the Viva has to be the staff (activities , buffet, & kids club). These young people go out of there to make you feel welcome and get involved in the activities. My four year old wanted to stay at the kids club more than with us. The negatives said about the front desk and management in other reviews are about right. Again, the staff we saw most often more then made up for their bosses. As for the rooms, they were small but clean. There are no dressers so be prepared to live out of your suitcases. The buildings don't have central a\\c., the a\\c unit in our room was very loud; not so great for light sleepers. We had a fridge that was not stocked. I found out from the tour rep. that a mini-bar is offered by some tour operators but not SUNWING. The beach was nice; the pool the smallest of any resort we have stayed at. The biggest negative for us was the food. Having only one buffet restaurant, we expected Viva would be able to offer greater variety and more theme nights. That was not the case ,and it was the singularly most commented topic from all other visitors I spoke with. The a la cartes are ok if you can get a reservation. Overall, the activities staff, and meeting people from other parts of North America made it a nice week (I won't comment on the Europeans in general or the Italians specifically). In the end, compared to other 4* resorts and what they offer, we won't be going back to Viva Maya.", "Date": "February 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quebec", "Title": "\u201cSold as a 4 star and experienced a 4 star\u201d", "Author": "QuebecBbboomer", "ReviewID": "UR13712785", "Content": "Stayed at the Wyndham Maya for 2 weeks - Jan. 26/08 -- Feb. 09/08 Beach: The best at playacar if you don't consider sandbags to be a problem. You can walk for miles going south but you can't walk beyond the Hotel going north. No beaches left in that direction. Considering the overall situation with beach erosion... we were satisfied. Out of the 14 days, there was only 2 days where swimming was prohibited due to rocky sea. Not much palm trees other than small artificial... shade was a bit difficult to find. Plenty of chairs. Food: We tried the 3 ''\u00e0 la carte restaurants'' (6 times) and had a great dining experience. We arrived at the hotel a saturday around 13:00 and reserved for the week immediately without any problem. For the 2nd week, we reserved friday... again no problem. You will never see the restaurants more than half full probably due to the fact that personnel is limited. That's the only reason we can see... but... the service is super fast. As for the buffet it was ok. We always managed to find something that would match our taste. (Beef, chicken, pasta etc...). Room: Somewhat old but very clean. Good shower, excellent bed and good TV (if you care). The air conditionner is very efficient. The only negative about the room was the humidity at times but I think this is more typical of Mexican weather. Noisy at night untill 11pm if you're near the theatre but considering we had a view on the pool and beach... hey you can't have everything !!! Bars: Excellent service... we never waited more than 2 minutes to get a drink. Considering the hotel was about full it's quite impressive. Landscape: Lots of trees and vegetation superbly kept. Birds concerts every day as you walk along. Weather: About 30 minutes of rain around 6am out of 14 days. Can't beat that. Temperatures range from 20 in the morning to 30 in the afternoon. Humidity is extremely high but you don't really feel it on the beach. Things to do: Visited Chitchen Itza pyramids and Tulum. Chitchen is a full day round trip on the bus. Interesting but not impressed considering we left at 7:30am to return around 20:00. For us we tought Tulum was nicer considering you have a spectacular view on the sea and the small beach is nice. You can swim. Spent half a day there. From what we heard, Coba ruins might be a better choice considering it's less than 2 hours to get there. Playa Del Carmen: 30 minutes walk to the famous 5th avenue. Impressive... so many stores and ''caf\u00e9s''. A taxi ride will cost you 5 us $$. - 10 minutes. Overall: We had a great trip. The strong point about riveria maya is that the staff is very efficient (fast service) compared with Cuba or the Dominican Republic. Weather is great but humidity is high. The sea is also mostly rocky - nice waves. Would we go back to this resort? No but only because we like to try something different when we travel. Would we recommend this resort? Yes considering what you get for the price.... a 3/12 to 4 stars resort. extremely well kept. Hope this review was helpfull.

Reason for having fun - TIP generously ( I spent in 7 nights, US$100 in tips) as they all work hard and earn meagre wages - Reached the hotel at 7 am and the check in was at 3 PM. Requested the front staff supervisor for an early check in and handed him a bill of $10. We were checked in at 10 am with a ocean view room. The baggage handles were helpful and took care of our luggage when checking in and out. Rooms was neat and clean , not fancy, but comfortable to sleep. Toilet had enough hot water and shower had good pressure at all times. A $2 tip each day to the maid bought us with enough towels (6 towels for 4 of us) and 2 water bottles every day, our clothes folded and kept neatly in the wardrobe. The safe was working well and easy to operate. The first thing we did after arriving at the resort (before check in) was book restaurants. $10 tip got us 4 bookings out of 7 days - 3 at Maya and 1 in Azetec. Restaurants were very good with good food except the Italaian Portofina - horrible food (ended up later eating agin at the buffet that night.) on other days just showed up at the restaurant at 8.30 pm and a $5 tip did the magic and we were in. So all seven nights we ate at the restaurants. Loved Don Diego and Miramar. Enjoyed the breakfast buffet and the omlettes chef was fantastic. Also ate lots of fruites. Lunches use to be mostly at the 24 hour cafe by the pool side. $2 tip will bring me a 2 full size fresh pizaas exclusively made for us. we did not eat other stuff there as it was said to be recycled from previous night's dinner buffet (as told to us by a few Canadians). Overall for food I will give 7 out of 10. Kids loved the activities and entertainment staff, enjoyed tennis, archery, wall climbing, etc. entertainment staff did not really expected any tips but a $5 bill was appreciated for more time and repeated trips on the cataramas for all 7 days. The enertainment was good (not as good as vegas) but is bearable - better to watch them rather than soend that time drinking. After every 3/4 drinks would tip $1 and the bartenders rotate between poolside and the lobby area so always approach the same bar tender who would remenber you and the drink you prefer. The tips got me brand name drink at all times and also was suggested to try a few new cocktails that were not on the list. Stay away from the vacation club reps moving around. Just dont see eye to eye and nobody will approach you. Stay away from all the vacation club memebership deals they offer you - not worth the time (as informed by other canadians) Disco was great and the bartender always offered brand name drinks if tipped in advance. Coffee at the breakfast buffet was horrible. I would always drink american coffee at the lobby bar and tasted great. Good walk to Playa de carman 5th avenue shopping and bargain for one third the price they ask or walk away, they will call u back. shop from 8 - 9 pm for good deals. Lot of topless sun bathing but it was not that apperent unless you really pay attention. Kids never even realise it or made any comment. Trip to Tulum was facinating. Dont take the tour, take a cab to collectiva from playa de carman and in $3 you will reach Tulum. cab costs $45. Took a tour bus to Chetcne Itza from across the street travel agent from the resoprt for $75 per adult if paid by cash (other wise $99) and after bargaining our 13 year old was offered a free ride ( paid $225 for 4 of us in total).

Very close to Playa Del Carmen. It was also a very safe resort. We found the rooms to be quite average but very, very clean. We were impressed with how much attention was given to the overall cleanliness of the entire resort. The beach was incredible. I would highly recommend packing a few towels. water, etc and walk about 15 minutes to the south. Once there you will find a beach that is almost deserted, with no sand bags and it appears to go on forever. The bar staff, entertainment staff and food staff were very professional, polite and provided efficient service. We travelled with two teenagers (13 and 16) and they loved the resort My kids thought that the nightly performances were spectacular. My wife and I only watched two of the shows and they were quite well done. Negatives: When we checked in they placed wrist bracelets on all of us. By the time we walked to our room, my daughter's bracelet had fallen off. Obviously it was not put on properly. Unfortunately we could not locate it. I went back to the desk to ask for a replacement. They would not provide one unless I paid $10 USD for it. No amount of explanation was acceptable for them. Overall I found the front desk staff to not be very helpful or courteous. We had requested an a la carte meal on Feb 09 in order to celebrate a birthday. We were told that they could not accommodate us. Yet, when we checked the restaurants on that night they were all 1/2 full. Miscellaneous: Quite a bit of topless sunbathing on the beach. If this offends you don't stay here. We had no problem with it and after the second day you hardly notice anymore. We took a tour called the \"talum Plus\" . It was sensational. We spent time in Talum and then went to a Mayan village for lunch. We were able to observe their way of life and tour their homes. It was quite interesting. We then swam in a cenote followed by a couple of zip line rides over a massive cenote. The zip line rides were quite tame. I would highly recommend this tour. Remember to shop around. The hotel wanted $400 for four of us. We were able to find the exact same tour for $300 by just going across the street from the hotel and speaking to another tour operator.

My two children (11 and 7) had the time of their life, this was the best kids club I have seen anywhere. They never even looked twice at topless bathers! Most of the tourists were Canadian and Italian, but there were also tourists from all over Europe, Chili, Argentina and Mexico. I have stayed in quite a few all-inclusive resorts but this one was definitly the best.

We spend very little time in our room so it wasn't a big deal but was definately a disappointment., The grounds are beautifully kept and the entire complex feels very safe.

The sand bags in the water to help keep the sand on the beach run vertical to the beach; unlike some resorts where the sand bags run parellel making swimming in the ocean difficult.

The grounds are lovely - well taken care of, very lush with a nice central plaza by reception. The rooms are disappointing. Small hotel type no dresser with a TINY patio (ground floor). The bedside lights had energy efficient bulbs in them with no shades - terrible lighting. They took our fridge out the second day we were there even though we were supposed to have one. This happened to quite a few people. The front desk staff were quite rude even though we were being pleasant when we tried to talk to them about the problem. They wouldn't do anything about it.

Water was however scarce in the a.m. before about 9:30 so make sure you get some at night. The beach was nice but extremely crowded with lounge chairs - almost to the water. We swam at the next door beach (Riu) to get a bit of space. You will not get much of a rest at this beach. It was very noisy with extremely loud music pumping out most of the day. Euro disco type - sometimes latin but not very often. Acouple of guests had arguements with the music staff to turn it down a bit. There were continuous activities - if you like these you will be happy. Merengue, agua gym, stretching, soccer, volleyball, pool gladiator,bocce ball etc, etc, all continuously announced over loud speakerts with staff constantly asking you on the beach to come and join in. Music was quieter from 1 -2pm and began again with activities in the pm. A note to smokers - THE BEACH IS NOT YOUR ASHTRAY PLEASE STOP PUTTING BUTTS IN THE SAND!!!! The food - We could not get a reservation at any of the restaurants for the whole week when we lined up the first morning to reserve!! A TIP - check with the concierge after lunch we got three cancellations this way even though we wished later we had not. The food in the restaurants was really disappointing. Couldn't tell the beef was beef! Don't bother. We didn't get into the Italian or Asian so I can't speak for them but others said they were not good either.

Service from the concierge was good, the baggage handlers - good, room service good, reception - poor All in all we would not return - most other couples we talked to said the same thing some were quite angry with their accommodations.

Overall, this resort is good value. The resort seems very well run and the staff were always helpful and professional. I would have given this resort a higher rating if it had not been so crowded. It was at capacity the week we stayed and I think our holiday would have been much more relaxing had there been half the number of people. If you don't want to wait in lineups or be in crowds on your holidays I would not recommend this resort. For example, I always waited behind at least 2-4 people at the beach bar; waiting to get a hamburger at either the inside or outside grill usually took 5-10 minutes (and while waiting one day someone told a story of how a lady came up the previous day to the front of the line, waved a bill and took all the hamburgers that everyone else had been waiting for); there's only one shower stall with two units on the beach - for the amount of people there should have been 2-3 because again you'de usually wait in line; we tried to make dinner reservations on our first morning there and were told we could only get spots for the last two days of our week - other people told us similar stories and for some strange reason the restaurants were only half full every time we walked by them; the buffet restaurant doesn't open until 6:30pm so there's usually a lineup to get in before the doors open and then once you're inside there's tons of people elbowing and whizzing in front of you at all of the food stations; people get up early to place towels over the very limited number of beach chairs under the umbrellas - I got up one morning very early to watch the sunrise and by 6:30 all the chairs under umbrellas were taken - this is frustrating when you come to Mexico to enjoy the ocean/beach but can't find any shade all day long. I agree with the other reviews about the exceptional staff and entertainment. There are activities all day long which is great, however, there's really no place to go to get a break from the noise and activity - there are 3 hammocks but often they're full and there's right by two sidewalks so people are constantly walking by. Our room faced the pool, theatre and activities but had it been facing the outside of the resort perhaps we could have gotten some quiet time on our balcony. This is a very high energy resort which is perfect if that's what you're looking for. If you're looking for a more relaxing holiday with less congestion, this is not the place for you.", "Date": "January 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alabama", "Title": "\u201cSOLID \"A\" for our family of four (kids 12, 7)\u201d", "Author": "hhbeverly", "ReviewID": "UR13121354", "Content": "***It may be helpful to read my profile to evaluate this review*** We returned on 1/29/08 from a week at the Maya. Like other TripAdvisor members, I was a little worried reading some of the reviews so let me say that I went to this property with a critical eye. Although we did run into a few problems during our stay they were NOT vacations spoilers and the good definitely outweighed the little bad. Our check in was uneventful and smooth however, since we arrived at 1pm, our room was not ready (check in is 3pm). They did give us our bracelets and pointed us toward the buffet. After lunch we decided to kill a few minutes and get reservations at the al la carte restaurants. We were saddened to learn that they could only offer us ONE night during our entire stay. Bummer, so we planned to get up early a couple of mornings to try to get a couple of other nights either at the Maya or Azteca. Speaking of the Azteca, this is the Maya's sister property five resorts to the north that you can use also - pools, resaurants, beach, etc. We finally got into our room about 2:15pm. Our room was in the building by the \"adult only\" pool - which my kids disliked - but later enjoyed since it put us right by the kids activities w/ kids club, archery, rock wall climbing & tramp-the latter two you must be 12 to do. The room was nice, not lux but nice: tile floors, ceiling fan, two queen beds, small balcony, mini fridge (soda, beer, extra H2O), FREE safe, iron& board, hairdryer, plenty of towels and a TV with 20 or so channels-4 or 5 English speaking channels (Cartoon Network is one). Plus our room was very clean and kept so daily. My son even walked into the closed sliding glass door one day because he said it was \"too clean\" so he thought it was open. The only room problem we encountered was on two afternoons, after returning from beach, we found our room hotter than it was outside. The first time we had to call once and visit the desk x 2 to get it fixed and the other time we just went to the desk looking really unhappy. Both times it was fixed while we were at dinner. We read a thing in the bathroom that said you are to throw dirty towels on the floor to get new ones. If you hang them up, you don't. Water bottles were refilled using a dispenser in the hall. Soap and shampoo are in a wall dispenser in the shower but we brought our own just in case. Food was good and we always found something we really liked. It is buffet food - enough said? However, it was so good that we didn't pursue any other al la carte reservations during our stay and no one ever got an upset tummy. The restaurant at the pool/beach was our least favorite but it is what it is. The offerings included nachos, fruit, hot dogs, burgers, usually a salad of some sort (rice, pasta, etc) but they did make a REALLY good wood fired pizza - or maybe it was all the Dos XX's I drank? If you want pizza, though, be prepared to stand in line! The pool was nice although it could get crowded during water activities. If you are w/o kids though, you can use the adult/quiet pool on the street end of the property. It too has a bar. ***THE BEACH IS, as it turns out, THE BEST ON THIS STRIP OF PLAYACAR!*** There are huge sandbags jutting out into the ocean every 75' but, IMO, they do in no way detract. Walk south on the beach to see what happens w/o them! This resort was really well situated for our family, too. Across the street from the hotel is a little touristy shopping area with pretty much anything you would need. This part of Playa del Carmen is called Playacar and it is just south of the town. It was an easy walk even with kids in tow, maybe two miles, and we passed a Mayan ruin area and botanical garden. We have equated this area to a second-world Hilton Head Island since it has bike paths, tree lined streets and is very clean. Playa is a nice seaside town easily explored. Our only other excursion was to Tulum and we got there by using public transportation (very nice!!) which cost the four of us 25$ round trip. The public buses were very nice and MUCH better than anything I've EVER ridden in the US! The main bus terminal is right in Playa, was easy to get to, easy to navigate and clean, clean, clean. Tulum was worth seeing but do get a guide. Ours cost us $30 but he pointed out things that we would never have noticed. The animation team is pretty incredible. They do everything from 10am until the last show is over about 11pm - that's ONE 13 hour shift! They ran ALL the group activities: aerobics, merengue lessons, stretching, kids club, beach games, Spanish lessons, kids disco and finally the big show at night. The shows at night were fun and were really, really good considering they are produced by mostly kids (20 something\u2019s) who reportedly make about $150 a MONTH! This property is the smallest AI we have ever stay at (only 400 rooms) but it was perfect for our family. The kids were able to come and go at their leisure to kids activities (in pairs) and we never felt uneasy. Our compliments to Carlos w/ the animation team for his care of our kids! In addition to all the other activities, there are three hammocks in a small garden, a waist high chess set, a bocce ball/horseshoe pit, tennis courts, bicycles, boogie boards, snorkel equipment, catamarans and sea kayaks - all free! Finally, I have to tell you, when you see the animation team taking photographs PLEASE take advantage of this. During our stay they took many pics of our kids, some even w/o our knowledge. Fortunately, we just happened to look at them while we were waiting for our departure ride, and they were ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING! We bought a CD of pics for $30 and you can find the kiosk in just off the lobby by the bar. They keep the pictures for three weeks. If I had known how good those guys with the cameras are, I'd have left mine in the room! Overall, this property may not be the newest or the nicest in Playa, and yes, we did see some maintenance issues (especially with the beach showers) however we also saw staff working everyday to fix these things, but neither was this trip a budget breaker! Will we return to this property? A definite yes and maybe as soon as December '08 with our extended family.", "Date": "January 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cJust Perfect!\u201d", "Author": "SpankyMontoya", "ReviewID": "UR13081823", "Content": "We are a married couple in our late 30s and have been travelling to all-inclusives since 1995 and haven't missed a year yet. In fact, we have been going twice a year since 2003 and this year we will be going a fourth time (3 all-inclusives and a wedding in Kona, Hawaii)...we love the sun and we love the beach. This hotel was great from beginning to end. Check-in was hassle-free and quick. We were the first checked in and in our rooms with 15 minutes of getting off the bus. The room was a bit small but had everything we needed including a coffee maker, a fridge stocked with beer, pop and water, an iron and a safe that was free to use. The bathroom was large and the water pressure was awesome. The balcony was a bit small too but there were a lot of rooms that had big balconies if that is important to you. We tipped our maid 20 pesos a day and she kept us stalked with extra towels and the fridge full. The pool was a good size but not the biggest we have ever seen. It was warm and kept clean. There was a swim up bar but we never saw a bartender there so noone could use it. The beach was clean when you consider the amount of people that use it and that most of them are 2-pack-a-day smokers from Europe. Getting a chair on the beach was not difficult even when you get down there at 10am. However, getting a chair under a palapa at 6:15am is impossible. This resort is owned by an Italian company and therefor attracts a lot of Italians and other Europeans...my point here is that there is a lot of topless beauties and a few topless grandmothers. If you are a looking for that then this resort is for you. It was a happy accident for us or should i say ...me. There were sand bags like other reviewers pointed out but they were no intrusive at all. They actually helped control the waves that came in. This is not something that people should complain about. The buffet was excellent. Lots of choice and constantly filled by the staff. The waiters were not consistent with there refills on beverages but it was never a far walk to the beer tap or juice/pop dispensers. The buffet area was very clean too. We didn't get a chance to go to any a la cartes because we had a few dinners in Playa Del Carmen instead so I have no idea if they were any good. The activities staff were so fun. They were not pushy if you didn't want to participate but were excited if you did. They were all smiles and they were very social. At meal time, they would come and sit with the guests to eat and chit chat. They had all the activities you could think of too. The shows they put on were the typical resort shows but they were entertaining nonetheless. Our favourite was the Michael Jackson show on Saturday night. We thought it was going to be a show that made fun of his career but these guys took it seriously with choreography, lighting and costumes...that added to the entertainment (for us). Guys, wait until you get a look at the activities girl named Alma and ladies I think you'll like Marquito. 5th Avenue in Playa Del Carmen is a 5 minute taxi from the resort that costs 50 pesos or $5US. It is a 30 minute walk if you want some exercise. The shops are all the same so you have some good bargaining power when you want something. I have never seen so many Corona cowboy-style hats in my life and everyone seemed to be wearing them. In conclusion, this resort was great. It had everything we wanted and more. We booked this trip last minute for $733 including all taxes and we can't complain about the value because it was great. The majority of people were between 25-40 with a mix of singles, couples and families. I would give it a 4star rating based on caribbean standards. Don't expect a 4star by North American standards because this isn't it.

Reasons why we LOVED our stay at the Viva Maya resort: -Great, friendly and always smiling staff, -Wonderful entertainment team, who organized many activities during the day - from stretch classes to dancing lessons, to games, and a great nightly show - we loved Marquitos, Lily, Marcos and Nadia; -Amazing kid's club - I actually had to limit how much time my two children spent there as I wanted them to be with us! Nadia & Marcos were just great with the children! -The food was excellent - particularly at the restaurants - but you need to book as soon as you get there!! -The beach was great - sure, there are a few sandbags, but there were plenty of open areas with no sandbags where you could swim! -The pool was big enough. We spent a lot of time both at the beach and at the pool. -The rooms were very clean. -After dinner we loved getting a capuccino from the bar (excellent!) and sitting in the \"plaza\". -You can use the bikes they provide to go into town - or you can walk - only about 25 min. walk to Playa del Carmen - great for shopping for silver. -There is a safe box in each room - we used it and our valuables and money were safe. -The ONLY thing that we found at the end - beware of leaving valuables in your suitcases if you leave your bags with the bellboys for a while until your departure - we had put a cell phone and two sunglasses in the side pockets of the suitcases and when we got home, they were gone! We are not sure if this happened at the hotel, but it is most likely that it did... ADVICE: bring a lock for your bags and don't put anything valuable on the side pockets!

Tip...if your looking for that perfect beach go to the Catalonia Playa maroma, excellent beach. Anyways, back to the review. We knew before hand about the beach but it didn,t matter to us. The pool area is good. The rooms are nice and very clean, and there is absolutely no musty odor when you first come in. The air conditioner works well. The food is good, we always found something we liked. The restaurants are very good especially the Miramare, excellent food. Book your reservations as soon as you get there because they book fast. The Azteca is just 4 resorts down the street, so you can use their facilities as well. You can also book with the a la carte's there too. The animation staff is very friendly and they really put a lot of work into the shows. If you have kids, the kids club is excellent and they actually have the kids in the shows.

The hotel was not full, but even so we were put at the back of the hotel with a view on a wall. But we were only in the room to sleep so that didn't worry us too much. The food and restaurants were a bit of a trial though. We arrived a Wednesday evening, and at 8am the next day lined up to make restaurant reservations for one of the 3 restaurants, only to find out that there was no availability until the Sunday night, our last night. It appears that people arriving on Saturdays make their reservations for the whole week, leaving people who arrive mid-week with no choice but the buffet, which is average. Breakfasts were very good though. We complained and spoke to the manager but they did nothing to help us. What was worse was that the restaurants were always half empty! The staff working in the buffet area varied - some were extremely pleasant, and some were rude. On one evening, we arrived around 8.30pm to be informed that there was no wine left (at an all inclusive we couldn't believe this!!!) only to see some of the waiters drinking red wine round the corners and with their backs turned to us. There were a couple of them who were noticeably drunk. We were extremely disappointed by this. The beach was lovely, especially when you compare to the hotel beaches further down the coast, which have barely any beach left due to the hurricanes. The pool area was nice too. The entertainment was pretty bad in the evening, but probably ok if you're with a family! We visited the Azteca, and were definitely pleased to be at the Maya. The other is older, was very empty and had less atmosphere. All in all, we got a good deal, so for the price it was fine, but otherwise I wasn't overly impressed with this hotel.

Needless to say, we were a little nervous from reading the reviews that were posted after we booked our holiday in October. As this is the fifth all inclusive vacation that I have been on in the past 9 years, I think I have a good perspective. Check-in was fast and easy, the only problem was that only 3 of the 4 rooms were located together, which was rectified the next day. The rooms were good enough for our needs, beds are hard, shower had plenty of pressure, beach and pool were a 20 second walk which was great (Chichen Itza building) Food was good, but wouldn\u2019t rate higher than a 3.5 to 4 star. We tried the Portofino al la carte and it was without a doubt the best one that we have dined at (Including 4.5 and 5 star Iberostar\u2019s). Activities: A recent review indicated that teenagers were not welcome to participate in volleyball etc events. This was absolutely not the case for us; at least half of the participants were teenagers. The beach is the second best other than the Sandos along this stretch of the Playacar development. There are several others to the south that have been devastated by the Hurricanes the past few years so we were lucky with ours. A great deal of work is being done to reclaim sand and they protect the beach with large sandbags that several others have discussed. Staff in the restaurant and the beach bar were very friendly and made us feel like family. The shows were pretty good, but don\u2019t worry if you miss one or two (except for the Madonna review which is their blockbuster).

Booked through sell off vacations, great price as always. Went with Sunwing, overall I found them a little less organized then Sunquest and Signature but the flight went fine, the shuttle was easy to find and they sold Corona on the 50 minute bus ride to the hotel for $3 us which is very civilized. Check in went smoothly, and there are lots of bell boys to help you with your luggage. The resort is set up with two buildings one on the left and one on the right of the lobby courtyard. We were in room 2313. The 2 stands for the building, the 3 for the floor and the 13 for the room. In building two all the odd numbers face the ocean and in building one the even numbers face the ocean. The lower the room number ie 1, 3, 5 ,7 etc the closer to the ocean you are. We had a great view and at the end of our hall there was a balcony facing the ocean with a table and chairs. Room; clean, spacious, great room safe, bar fridge with one bottle of water and lots of hangers in the closet. Bathroom had a bath and shower, not great pressure and no bathtub plug (I used the bathmat to hold the water in!!) Only one bar of soap and the shampoo was in a dispenser on wall. Hairdryer and thick towels. Small balcony with two chairs and a table. Beach: One of the biggest in the area. Lots of chairs, only a few palapas (umbrellas), sometimes the ocean is very wavy, sometimes calm. There are big sand bags being used to reclaim the beach, they were not a problem for us. Good snorkelling, kayaking, catamarans that you could take out on your own and a good dive shop with free lessons. A reef dive was $45 US and 15 US for the equipment. You catch the boat just down the beach. Well worth the cost. Pool: The pool was large and lots of beach chairs around it. Activities: The staff worked hard to get participants for their activities but did not seem interested in our teenage boys participating. The boys were not allowed to play soccer, volleyball, archery or waterpolo. This was very disappointing for them. If you have younger children looking for these activities you may want to consider another resort as they seem to cater more to the adults and very young children. Town: Playa del Carmen was a short taxi ride ($5US) to get there. Lots of shops but the bargaining was not as good as I have experienced in Puerto Vallarta and the selection of goods were not as nice in my opinion. Tulum: To get to tulum for the most reasonable price ask the taxi driver to take you to the servico collective in Playa del Carmen and for $3US per person you take a van from Playa del Carmen to Tulum , they drop you off on the highway about a 500 meter walk to the ruins. Ask the driver to let you know when to get off. On the way back walk back out to the highway and you will see the vans stopping to pick people up for the ride back (only $2.50 US). You can hire a guide once at the ruins or walk around on your own, spend as little or as much time as you like. Take your bathing suit they have a great beach to swim from. Food: Overall the food was fine, the Mexican and Portofino restaurants were our favorites (did not care for the Italian one) The buffet was a little disorganized in it\u2019s set up but the food was ok (not exceptional but not awful) The lobby bar was popular for it\u2019s cappuccinos and drinks. The snack bar was not as good as I would have liked. Selection was minimal and the quality was not great. This is a popular resort with Europeans and it was hard to get use to their aggressive behaviour so be prepared to defend you spot in line etc!! Overall I would recommend this property for adults but to be honest I will likely go back to the west side of Mexico, I just found the people in Playa del Carmen a little less friendly then the other side and I found I enjoyed the shopping and countryside more over there.

We arrived early in the morning, I mean early, landed in Cancun at 5:30 AM so that put us to the resort at 7:00AM. We were met by one of the bellhops to help with the bags. Check in was a breeze even though our room was not ready; I really didn\u2019t think it should be that early. The bellhop showed us where we could change clothes and get some breakfast and a bloody mary. He even hunted us down to tell us that the room was ready early and helped us to the room at about 11:00 am. ROOM We were in the new building by the quite pool. It was on the top floor. They have no elevators so you could get some exercise just in case you ate or drank too much. Ha ha which of coarse we did once or twice. The room was excellent, had two beds, shower, Jacuzzi, two sinks, TV, small balcony. Did not notice any noise that kept me awake. FOOD At the buffet there is plenty of different food choices, have an omelet made for you in the morning, or get a little bit of everything. I personal love having some beans with my scrambled eggs, it was delicious. Some of the choices might not look as good as the rest so if you don\u2019t want to try it, then don\u2019t. We never left there hungry that is for sure. The staff is wonderful!!! If you want something and don\u2019t see it ask and they will bring it to you if they can. They work so very, very hard. Every time we ate I would leave a tip. From what I saw the pool snack bar was the same thing daily. But it\u2019s a snack for us, not a meal. The place you must eat at is the DON DIEGO!! The food, is wonderful, the staff is the excellent!! Luis was our waiter and he went beyond his duties!! Ask for him to be your server and tell him Cathy and Mike sent you. We had eaten there for our anniversary dinner. It will be a night I will never forget. Thanks to Marco and Luis, really the whole crew. Marco is the captain of that restaurant, what an asset he is!! We would run into Marco at the pool bar and he remembered our names and also stops what he was doing to see that we were having a good vacation. Not all the bosses did that. Those two made a big impression on us!! Next must is Portofino, the food is great and so is the staff!!! If I could eat at only these two places the whole I would have. You will not go wrong or hungry!! POOLS We sat at the quite pool a lot of the time. They have a little bar about 10 feet from the chairs so you never were thirsty. The drinks were great. Just tell him want you want and bang it\u2019s there. The only thing that was a con would be they need more shade at the resort, both pools and the beach. In the afternoon we would go to the main pool bar and sit by the snack bar and have a few drinks. The bartenders are crazy there. Ha ha just kidding but after a few drinks they remember what you are having and start making the minute they see you, that was nice. Both pools and the beach had the leave the towel thing going on. Towels were on chairs all day and we never seen a sole. I wanted to take the towels and turn them in, but my husband is too nice. That really bugs me, use it or give it up. Beach If you could get some shade grab it. You can always move your chair to get sun. I love the sun but a person can only handle so much of it in a day.

It is most definitely a 3 star at best. However, for the price it is a great place to vacation. Don't go with high expectations and you won't be disappointed. Our first stay at the Maya was in October 2006. This was also our very first time to Playa so we did not know what to expect. The resort is in a fantastic location within walking distance or a short cab ride to 5th Ave where you will find shopping, restaurants and nightlife. We highly recommend spending some time on 5th Ave. The Maya has plenty of activities and a beautiful beach to keep you busy. We were a bit worried when we booked our second trip in October 2007 because we had read several reviews that the beach had been demolished by a tidal surge. They have worked very hard to repair the beach and I am happy to report it is nearly back to perfect condition. Oct 2006 we were in room 2101. This room has a terrible mold/must smell that will stick to your clothing. If you end up in this room ask for another because your clothes will never be the same! Oct 2007 we were in room 1314 which was fantastic. No problems with smell and the view was great. Take advantage of the activities. We didn't in 2006 but the second time around we did and had a lot of fun. Also, be aware that a majority of the people staying at the resort are European. Some people might not like that but my husband and I enjoyed speaking with people from different countries. The food at the Maya is ok. The buffet can get very boring after a while so be sure you book reservations for the restaurants as soon as you arrive. If you find yourself without dinner reservations we recommend taking a cab ride to 5th Ave and eating at La Parillia (sp?). They have great Mexican food and it is a very fun atmosphere. Be sure to get a table upstairs by the railing so you can people watch while you wait for your food. If you are into fitness be aware the gym at the Maya is not air conditioned and the equipment is not the greatest. You will work up a sweat just walking in the door! We worked out in the very early morning or evening when it cooled down. The Maya is all inclusive including drinks but if you want the top shelf stuff you gotta ask for it! Also, the bar near the lobby has espresso. Although we will likely stay at another resort on our next visit to Playa, I would recommend the Maya to a friend or family member looking for a great value.", "Date": "January 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moses Lake, WA", "Title": "\u201cIt was horrid this time\u201d", "Author": "Hayes2258", "ReviewID": "UR12147125", "Content": "We had stayed at the Viva Maya 3 years ago and loved it.

I truly could not understand what people were complaining about, although I looked. We are a middle aged couple who have seen many places worldwide and are accustomed to above average accomodations and many of the comforts of home. We found all the comforts of home plus far superior customer service than in many establishments here! The humidity in the area makes for wonderfully lush vegetation, filled with vocal birds and colourful flowers.....so relax and let your hair do as it wishes. The evening temperature was perfect and we never needed a sweater as we did in the dry cool air in Los Cabos. Our room was in the new building by the adult only quiet pool, which was honoured for a change, offering much needed r&r to those travelling without children. The room was large, clean, with a seating area and overlooked the pool. The decor was neutral with above average finishes including marble floors and bathrooms. We did not need the AC as there was a ceiling fan above the bed that was quieter. The ensuite bathroom was large with a separate shower, double sink and large oval tub. The main pool area was large and chairs were almost always available, even during a very busy week. There were lots of activities and play areas for both adults and kids. The beach was gorgeous, even with the rock looking sandbags and again chairs were almost always available. Umbrellas were a little harder to secure, so head to the beach early if you need one. The food was excellent, even for my husband who is a picky eater. There is lots of variety at the buffet and the quality far exceeded my expectations. Something unusual about the dairy......eating even massive quantities of the wonderful cheeses and yogurt did not cause the usual upsets with stomach or nasal passages. I wish I could find Mexican milk products here! The bartenders were busy and generous with drinks. The Portofino Restaurant was fabulous as was the DonDiego. The Miramar, above the main pool area had good food, but somewhat slow as the kitchen was downstairs and the poor waiters were carting large trays up and down stairs....always with a warm smiles and kind words nonetheless. Don't go there if you may need to make a bathroom trip mid dinner....its all the way back down the stairs and by the stage. The service in the restaurants and the entire resort was sensational. We were amazed at the amount of staff at all times, many cleaning constantly and all exceptionally friendly and polite. I imagine these people survive on the tips...please be generous as thier service is sincere and most worthy. We were blessed with fabulous weather and seemless transfers to and fromt he resort. Ironically, the biggest glitch was at the Toronto airport at departure! The shows were fun and above average....the efforts of the entertainment team were obvious. I imagine the people who complained would find something to complain about at a 5 star resort as well. This was sold to us as a 4 star and a 4 star property was indeed delivered, but with the hospitality of long lost family. I would most certainly return to the Viva Wyndham Maya and recommend it to anyone.

Went with a girlfriend and 2 children, 2 and 11. I have stayed at all inclusives in Dominican and Cuba so have a good taste for what others do offer. We enjoyed the size of this hotel especially with a small child. You get to know everyone quite well and see everyone almost everyday. The food was typical of an all inclusive, the main eating area was near the lobby and you could go there for breakfast, lunch, dinner. Breakfast was good, yogurt, omlette requests, hash browns etc. We liked it. We did lunch at the snack bar by the pool. Pizza, pasta, nachos, fruit and hamburgers. You could also have breakfast there which was great if you rolled out of bed about 10 and wanted to head straight to the pool. We never had a problem getting chairs and could get them by the kiddie pool everyday. The people that complained about the food,...I'm not sure why. Its a buffet and they are cooking for a large volume of people. There was lots to choose from and if you didn't like something, you could choose something else. We didn't do the a la cartes due to the baby but heard good things about them. My kids loved the buffets but they are kids...LOL. All kids like eating pizza and pasta endlessly. But the adults liked them too, maybe it would be too much for 2 weeks. The beach was beautiful, sandbags didn't bother us. We did one day trip with Eddie's Edventures. We booked with him on the website prior to the trip. It was a great day, snorkelling in ceynotes, snorkelling in a lagoon, and in the ocean with sea turtles. Also Tulum. I highly recommend him if you don't want to do the big group trips. He took just our family for $65 per person. The shows every night were great. We saw everyone. They work so hard at these shows. You see the team working all day to entertain and then practicing for the shows all night. I talked to one of them and they work from 8am and to bed about 1am 6 days per week for a 6 month period. They are lip synched (I have been at other resorts where they sing live) but they do a great job. Kids club looked fun, my girls didn't use it.

Staff were great. Good meals on the flights. Overall, our whole group by the end of the week realized we got a steal of a deal. Rooms - Clean, good a/c systems, king pillow top beds, water available on every floor. What more do you need? Sometimes the maid would forget the odd thing like handtowels or something but we always caught her in the hallway. Beach - One of the best beaches in the area due to the work the resort has done to protect it. Yes, there are sandbags. They had NO effect on my enjoyment of the beach whatsoever.

I just got home this morning and even though there is snow here (and lots of it) I was ready to come home for sure. We booked our trip and were suppose to have an oceanview room, 2 bottles of water, a mini fridge, coffee maker and alarm clock in our room. We had none of these things. I went to the front desk and it was 3 days before they switched our rooms and it was not a smooth move as they dont help you move your things. This resort is well spread out and if u have a lot of luggage it can be quite the task to move your things. There is also no elevators. The beds in the room are very hard and it took a few nights just to get use to them. Oh the best part about the rooms is that they don't have towels. We had to ask for them, even when we switched rooms! What resort has no towels. No soap in the room, mini shampoo and conditioner bottles...nothing! The staff at this resort are alright. I have no complaints with the staff. The nightly entertainment was awesome, I watched the shows almost every night, very well done. The best thing at the resort I think. The beach was great. Even though it has sandbags, it was amazing, you can hardly tell they are there. The weather was not as sunny as I would have liked so it really was not good for tanning but you can't control the weather...the times I was able to sit on the beach it was great. The food here is not good at all. I had better food in Varadero! The snack bar by the pool is the worst on the resort next to the food at Miramare restaurant (the Italian restaurant above the pool bar), you get 6 la a cart dinners here. 3 at this resort and then you can go to the sister hotel the Aztec and have dinner there, it's all included as well. If you go to the Aztec, trust me stay away from the Chicken with stuffed shrimp with black sauce. It looks awful and tastes even worse. The mexician resturant at the Maya is the best food we had all week. They have a green soup that you can have to start and trust me, it was just wonderful. The pizza was good, bland but at some point all there was to eat cause the other stuff was just awful. They serve tuna on pizza, I even saw hot dogs on pizza. The hot dogs are really gross but maybe that is cause we put so much junk in ours and we have no idea what a real hot dog tastes like. Breakfast is the best meal on this resort by far. There is no bacon but you can get omlets made the way you want them and eggs cooked anyway you like (if they understand what you are asking). Lunch is nothing to write home about. Dinner same thing. If you want pasta ALOT this is the place for you! They have a pasta bar in the main buffett for lunch and dinner. They also have it on the buffett too just incase you dont want to create your own....the sauce was a little different from the 2 you could pick that the pasta bar where the guy makes it for you just the way you like it. The mexican food here is really bad! Don't expect to see taco's like we have here because we never saw one. They have flat shells that you can fill on your own but they go mushy really fast so its a waste of time. The drinks are the best at the main bar but the other bars are okay too. Watch out cause the guys make them strong at the pool bar if they are not paying attention. There is this thick strawberry drink with bananas in it that you have to try it's very good. The disco is a waste with a dj that is trying to get laid by any women he can. It is funny to watch but gets annoying after awhile. I only went to the disco twice and both times it emptied out after an hour tops. The dj will even hang around the bars trying to get in some womens pants so trust me it gets annoying after about 10 minutes of watching him make a fool of himself. I went her with a female friend and I think this resort is more for couples and families NOT FOR SINGLE PEOPLE AT ALL OR A GIRLS GETAWAY.

These buildings are furthest from the beach, but have the newest, largest rooms. The rooms can accommodate 2 double beds (we had 1 king sized bed). The bathroom had a shower and jacuzzi-like tub, with two sinks and a large mirror. Beside our building was a private (adult-only) pool with a bar. Very quiet/secluded and away from the animation staff music and events. The beach was surprisingly large as compared to neighbouring resorts where the ocean has eroded their beaches to barely any at all. They moved the volleyball court to beside the building to have more beach for the sun worshippers, so it is not very big, but it is out of the wind. They have kayaking, archery, trampolining and rock climbing, with staff to assist/educate. Lots to do...and great shows each evening...

There is also the pool, near the beach were there is a pool bar, a small outside jacuzzi and even a place to get massages near the beach, in a quiet area.

I had read the bad reviews before going and was a little nervous but could not see why people were complaining. It is a 4* resort so you can't expect things you would find at a 5*... First of all, absolutely join the ByRequest Club before you go (it's free to join on the Wyndham website) and then send the hotel an e-mail (or call them) prior to your arrival to let them know you are a ByRequest member and tell them your booking number. We went with another friends who didn't do this and although they also had a good time, they didn't get any of the upgrades that we got. ROOMS: basic room, what you'd expect from a 4*... bed(s), tv, closet - bathroom was actually quite large and the tub was very deep. The upgraded rooms have a better view (we looked over the ocean & the pool whereas our friends looked out to the lobby)... the upgraded rooms are slightly larger than the regular rooms and have more amenities such as a bar fridge & coffee maker). Also, the regular rooms have an air conditioning unit which is a little loud, the upgraded room has central air which doesn't make any noise at all. When we arrived, we had a bottle of champagne and a fruit plate already in the room. They are very clean, neither room had any mold at all. The cleaning staff did a great job everyday and when we walked in our room after it had been cleaned, our towels were shaped into a little animal on the bed! There was a large bottle of water in the room on the first day, we just kept filling it up from the water cooler in the hallway so we never had to ask for more. There was an ironing board in the room but no iron, I went down the the front desk and asked them for an iron, it was in the room waiting for us about 2 hours later and they left it there for the rest of the week. FOOD: BUFFET - I personally thought the buffet was great but I'm not a very picky eater. Breakast had everything you could want - cereal, oatmeal, fruit, yogurt, pastries, sausages, an omlette bar (they would also make eggs to order if you asked), and some other assorted items (pancakes, french toast, etc). Lunch, they had some assorted lunch meats & cheese, fruit, a salad bar, homemade soups, pizza, french fries, nachos, a pasta bar, fresh bread.... fish or chicken, some mexican items (tostida's, quesidillas, etc). desserts. Dinner had salad bar, soup, they always had fresh grilled fish and then another meat (one night was chicken, another was pork chops, and i heard someone say they had beef). fruit, rice, pasta bar... some more mexican items... desserts. For anyone who says the food is bland, it absolutely is but they have hot sauce at the buffet (2 kinds, red & green, both so good!!), salt & pepper at the table... I just seasoned my food as needed. We only ate 2 dinners at the buffet as we had a-la-carte's the rest of the nights, so I could definitely see eating at it for dinner could get old but on the other hand, just don't try everything on the first night and you'll be fine. Plus, if you get sick of it, you can always go over to the Azteca and use their buffet. There is also a buffet at the pool that serves breakfast, lunch and late night buffet. About half the mornings we had breakfast there, they had scrambled eggs, sausage, cereal, fruit, pancakes or french toast. We ate most of our lunches at the pool... nachos, french fries, pasta, burgers, hot dogs, pizza (the pizza was SOOO yummy!), fruit, small salad bar. We never ate at the late night buffet but from what I could see there was an assortment of items (rice, pasta, etc). We didn't eat at the buffet at the Azteca as we were completely satisfied with our own but did talk to others who ate there and said that it was really good. A LA CARTE: We ate at 5 of the 6 restaurants... first of all, as with any resort, you need to get down there early to book. They only take reservations from 8am - 2pm but I wouldn't wait! The first morning, we went down at 8am and there was already a line. We got our 3 reservations for the restaurants at the Maya for the last 3 nights of our trip but the Azteca, they only book the same day and it is limitted reservations. So we were able to book 2 of those... both those mornings I did line up at 7:15am just to be sure. We ate at the Xul-Ha (Mayan food) was really good! The Italian restaurant at the Azteca (I can't remember the name, it's extremely fancy, the food was amazing!). The Portofino (mediterranean grill) was excellent, the steak was great! The Miramatar (Italian) was very different from the one at the Azteca so no worries about eating at 2 italian restaurants... the salads here were to die for! The Don Diego (Mexican) was our favourite restaurant - the Fajita's were amazing! The only one we didn't get a reservation at was the Bamboo at the Azteca (Oriental) but we heard rave reviews! ENTERTAINMENT: We just loved it! Yes, it was definitely amateur but you saw them working hard all day and you could tell they were having a really fun time! You have to keep in mind that the majority of the staff in the shows had other jobs on the resort and so dancing/acting was not their profession. There were a couple people who definitely stood out as professionals and when they were introduced after the shows, their job was actually something to do with the shows themselves. We saw the shows all but 2 nights and had a lot of fun. The grease show was so much fun, they also did a Mystic night that had some great choreography, some nights they brought people up from the audience to compete (there was a couples event that was hilarious)! The sets & costumes were really done well. During the daytime, the staff was always running around trying to get people to join activities... they had dance lessons, drinking games, aqua aerobics in the pool, stretching on the beach, ping pong tournaments, volley ball, etc! I personally tried a few and even though they seemed lame, I had a great time!! The dancing was a tonne of fun and the aqua aerobics was a nice way to work off all the nachos!! lol SPA: We did end up going to the spa during one of the rainy days we had. The Spa was really nice and out back they had 2 jacuzzi's (one warm, one cold), plus a steam room and really nice change rooms. The atmosphere was very relaxing and the staff was great! My only disappointment was that while I was getting my pedicure, some people came in to get some services done and they were being quite loud (even though there is a sign that says to keep quiet). The woman asked them repeatidly to quiet down but they ignored her... obviously this is no fault of the resort, it's just rude people which you will unfortunately run into anywhere. That takes me to the comments about italians and people from other countries. I did find that there were more people from italy than any other country but I did not find that they were all rude... there were rude people but I wouldn't say they all came from the same country. There were also a lot of people from France and many other canadians as well... I think the entire week I only talked to one person from the US. THE POOLS & BARS: There are technically 2 pools, one which is the main pool that is sort of two pools separated by a raised area in the middle and then the Relax pool at the back of the resort which was for adults only. We spent most of our time by the main pool since that's where all the action was and it's right next to the beach, plus the pool buffet is right there. There was music playing and it was busy but the pool was never crowded. The Relax pool was definitely nice not having any children around and it has it's own bar there so you will get drinks faster at this pool, plus it's very quiet. I went down early every morning to get us seats reserved (I just placed our towels on the chairs and came back to the room for coffee... no one ever took our spots). If you want a spot on the beach that has a umbrella then you need to go early (about 7am), for a spot with an umbrella by the pool, you could go closer to 8am and be fine. If you didn't care about an umbrella, there were usually still spots left around 9am. Plus, a lot of people only sun in the morning so if you just keep your eye open, you'll see people leaving the pool area around noon. The only bar that closes at 6pm is the one at the Relax Pool (which since the sun starts to go down at 5pm, so there's not much reason to be at that pool much after that time anyway). The bar at the other pool is open until 2am, plus the bar at the disco and the lobby are open late as well. I found the beer was very good, not sure why there was complaints there... yes, there's only one kind but it was good so no complaints here. In town, they sell Corona, we bought some one day just for a change. OCEAN/BEACH: The ocean was gorgeous and the Viva Maya has the BEST beach in the area! We walked along the beach on either side and many resorts didn't even have much of a beach at all. They were constantly working on our beach, one day they roped off an area and set up a hose to pump more sand on our beach... yes it didn't look pretty with the big hose but honestly, I didn't care since I knew they were doing it to give us that amazing beach! There were a couple big sandbags in the water but honestly, if I had not read about them before going, I would have thought that they were big rocks!! The resort next door had ugly sand bags that just looked like plastic shopping bags, they were an eye sore but you couldn't see them unless you literally walked all the way to the edge of our beach. The ocean was a beautiful green/blue colour and very warm... warmer than the pool even! If you went to the water-sports booth, you could take out boogie-boards and body surf the big waves, it was a lot of fun. There were also catermarans & you could take windsurfing lessons (this was all included, the only water sports that cost extra are motorized items, such as the jet ski's). As for the toplessness... maybe it was a slow week for us but I barely noticed anyone. On the 3rd day I did see one woman walking around the beach with her top off and occasionally throughout the week I did see a few women sunning without there tops but I didn't find that it was overly done and other than the 1 woman walking around, they all seemed to put their tops back on when they stood up. This was only on the beach, they do not allow toplessness by the pool. I should quickly add as well that we were never bothered at this resort!! Not once did someone ask us about time-share on the resort (although they did in town) and only twice did someone come up to us to sell stuff on the beach... that is a LOT less than any other resort! Overall, this was an excellent resort. I think some people are just so picky that no matter where they go, they will have an issue... we had an amazing time and would absolutely go back!", "Date": "November 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cGreat vacation!\u201d", "Author": "tahria", "ReviewID": "UR11110035", "Content": "I should have written this review sooner after I got back, I only decided to write it after reading all of the negative reviews on this site. I think this hotel is getting a rather bad time of it and I really found it quite enjoyable. My boyfriend and I came here in Dec 2006, just before Christmas. It was our first AI trip and we weren't sure with all the crazy reviews out there, but we decided to grin and bear it, and with the price being lower than most, if it wasn't great we figured that would be ok. We booked through TravelCuts, and the tour operator was Sunwing. I found Sunwing rep on site to be quite willing to help, though we never really tried to get her help.. she was very busy a lot and we are pretty laidback so just didn't bother most of the time, except to book our trip to Xcaret... which was great! Underwater snorkeling there was amazing, as was dolphin swim... but beware it costs an extra $100 USD per person and you can't even bring your own camera, you have to buy their photos. =) Oh well. When we arrived at Cancun airport at 10pm, I thought we would be at the resort within an hour... not true apparently... it took til almost 1am to actually get dropped off by the bus at the resort. This was a little disappointing as when we got there, we got a welcome drink but were then told all the bars were closed for the night. Woke up early to meet the Sunwing rep the next morning, who gave us some tips and showed us the trips they offer. Overall quite helpful and friendly. Hotel itself was gorgeous grounds, clean, no problems at all. If you're really picky, the paint was peeling on a couple of the exterior walls but... really... it's Mexico. It's hot and humid. The room was average I think, quite clean (I am a little germ-obsessive so that must say something for it). There was no mini-bar but that didn't bother us as we didn't know there should have been! A/C worked fine (overtime, actually, if we left it on when we left the room it was sooo cold when we came back), not too noisy to sleep (I am also a light sleeper). Only problem with our room is that it overlooked the restaurant next to the resort, so the dishwasher boys could be heard yelling and clanging dishes, as well as the exhaust fan on the roof was quite loud. We did try to change rooms, but the ones they showed us didn't seem too much better so decided it wasn't worth the hassle. Also the front desk did not give us much attention re: the room change, we had to keep calling and going down there and kept getting the \"manager is out right now\" routine. Also, no bugs in the room except for the night we left some food out by accident... little tiny ones were all over the food by morning. So that got thrown out. But they leave drinks alone, even open ones that are sweet/fruity. Just seal your food and you'll be fine. Beach was AWESOME. Loungers were often busy but we would come around 11 or 12 and usually people had picked up and left for lunch or something, I guess, we were always able to find a couple here or there. Ocean was great also, very warm, sandy bottom (with a couple of rocks here and there, but very few). Pool was... OK? As I said, a little germ-obsessed so I don't spend much time in the pool. Buffet food was good, a la carte restaurant food was amazing, especially the Miramare (Italian)... we never did make it to the third, but the Mexican was also good. Only complaint was the \"kibble bins\" where they were supposed to have a buffet \"all day\" were frequently closed / emptied by about 1 am so if you get late night munchies, you may want to bring some snacks with you... my brother's girlfriend sent cookies with us to the airport and they saved us.

We stayed the Wyndham Maya during the week of Nov 10-17. I was a bit worried after reading some of the really negative reviews after we booked our trip... but I have to say my concerns where put at rest after arriving at hotel. The Hotel... first impressions... -------------------- The Wyndham is beautiful! The grounds are very well maintained, and more importantly the rooms we had were clean. We didn't find any evidence of 'black mold' in our rooms and that was one of the first things I looked for (because of one of the reviews I read here). Definitely the best beach front compared to the surrounding Hotels...white sands, crystal clear warm blue water. The service... -------------------- The housekeeping, wait & bartender staff are friendly, but 'tipping' definitely makes them friendlier...with noticeably better service. One thing about housekeeping though, they didn't refill our empty soap, we got some towels that looked soiled (they might have been washed but they looked dirty...we did get new ones when we called) and they didn't change the sheets everyday which is kind of gross and unacceptable for a 3-4 star hotel. The food... -------------------- Buffet: Not bad, but very 'generic' and bland to obviously accommodate everyone. They have theme nights like 'Asian & Italian' when we were there, but selection was pretty limited. But one HUGE concern was with ALL THE CHICKEN dishes. The Chicken was always under cooked or raw. I actually found a raw strip of chicken in the Chicken-catatori, which I pointed out to the staff, they apologized, but not discard the rest of the dish... so I'm sure some people got sick that night! Mexican restaurant: Fantastic service, food was the best out of the 3 non-buffet restaurants. Mediterranean restaurant: Poor service, food was very disappointing. Italian restaurant: Didn't go...went to the sister Hotel the Aztec to have the Italian. The service and food was wonderful. Entertainment... -------------------- The Entertainment staff deserves very high praise for their efforts to get everyone involved in the activities the hotel has to offer. They have endless energy and really look like they love their jobs! They put nightly shows, which are kind of amateurish, but still enjoyable to watch. The Guests... -------------------- When we are there I would have to say most of the guests where European (lots, of Italians & Germans some French), I only saw one Asian couple. The average age of the guests also was older than I expected.. I would have to guess around 38-50...not exactly a young crowd...so you would find most guests sun worshiping or drinking... the 'disco & nightlife' was non-existent... everything pretty much went quite by 10:00pm. While the 'Entertainment Staff' tried to get guests to mix it up a bit, I would have to say most guests stay to themselves. Shopping.. -------------------- There is basically a market across the street from the hotel, but the prices are pretty much set and the shop owner don't like to bargain... mainly pottery, t-shirts.. better to visit the '5 Avenue Market' it only about 5 mins by taxi or 15 minutes by walking. And the market has a zillion stores and restaurants. (Think Yonge St. for people familiar with Toronto) and the shop owner EXPECT tourists to bargain...so don't every accept the price they first quote you because you will overpaying by a lot! Our Sunwing rep, gave us some very helpful advise: 1) Alway set the taxi price before you get in and never pay before you arrive. The cost from the Hotel to the main tourist market: 5th Avenue should be no more than $5.00. 2) While the US currency is basically accepted at par (10 peso = 1 USD), if you pay in USD, ask if you will get change back in USD... some stores will try to take advantage of you and 'create' their own exchange rate or just give short change you when giving you change in pesos. 3) At stores where you can bargain, you should ALWAYS start at 50% or less of the price they want. Our rep tell us this the standard markup the locals try to get tourists to pay. Final thoughts... -------------------- Pros for me: For the price, I don't think you can complain. It was what we basically expected, with the exception of the food & housekeeping issue. The hotel is clean, well maintained, very scenic, has friendly staff and convenient to shopping. Cons for me: Older crowd, and mostly European... I would want more of an ethnic mix and a younger crowd. RAW CHICKEN is a staple at the buffet, staff apologized but didn't appear concerned enough to remove the dish. Housekeeping not always on their game..dirty towels, didn't fill our empty soap containers and didn't change sheets everyday.

If you read about 5 reviews back, you will see nothing but good reviews.. all of which give you hope. Then once I booked my trip I started to see all the negative ones being posted which started to get me worried I must say. I travelled with my boyfriend and 4 other guys so i'm sure if you were there you saw me, as being the only female in a 5 guy group I probably stick out. We stayed there Nov 3 - 10 The resort is a good deal if you are looking for cheap, but decent clean and a nice beach. Don't let those sandbags fool you at all... they are definately not what they seem in the pictures that people have posted. The beach is quite wide and very soft white sand.. however the RIU's on either side of the resort do have eroded beaches.. the Wyndham is by far the nicest beach in that section. There were lots of beach chairs.. yes some in better condition then others but whatever. The pool was an average size, never really went in but there was a swim up bar and food located close by. You can walk down to the right of the resort.. and you will pass buy a RIU, then the IBEROSTAR Tucan and then right beside it is the Sandos Playacar which is currently being renovated but has an AMAZING huge white sand beach that is empty you won't regret it... its only like a 10 min walk not even When I first arrived I was expecting the worst but hoping for the best... As time went on the resort won over my approval big time. I must admit the rooms weren't the best.... lacked in decor, beds not so comfortable but who the heck stays in the room anyways. You are just in there to sleep. The bathroom was very nice clean and quite large with a very very good shower. The rooms had virtually no mold... I had no problem at all. Please please keep in mind you are in a HOT country..you will see bugs.. and see things that you aren't used to.. thats part of the fun and it wasn't terrible so don't let those other reviews fool you. The grounds were very clean and well kept no negativity there. The shows that the entertainment staff did were entertaining from what we saw, better than alot of the resorts I have been to. They put alot of effort into entertaining the staff so give them some credit. The food was O.K. Not bad, but not phenominal. The people I travelled with liked it but I resorted to pasta most of the time.. and hamburgers and fries for lunch which is generally what you would expect at a resort. Who gets dressed to go to the buffet in the dining room anyway for lunch? Not too much to choose from. The dining room was large lots of seating. As far as drinks... i'm not sure where another person got off and said that they served NO NAME BEER??? They serve Dos Equis which is a very popular beer in mexico... you are lucky if you get served that, because alot of the time its just Corona or Sol. Another reader said they serve you small glasses... the glasses definately were not small and they give you PLENTY of alcohol. There is a cafe at the front to hang out at night where they play music and you can get coffees and they have a pretty extensive bar interms of choices. Big giftshop in front as well. We did parasailing one day, it was 50 bucks but fun.. something different. The crowd was lots of europeans.. lots of Italians which I agree with another member who mentioned they were not the friendliest group of people. Lots of topless women though.. so be prepared if you are against that sort of thing. The resort itself was a big mix age wise... lots of younger people, lots of families and some kids. The nightlife was fun.. Playa Del Carmen which is like 5minute taxi ride away is really nice. Blue Parrott is the spot to be.. its a beach party and lots of fun. 5th avenue is a european looking street that is very quaint and lots of bars to visit. If you want a bigger party you can travel to Cancun 45 minutes away.. we took a taxi there and back and paid 150 total round trip arranged by the hotel... but we bargained for it and the driver will wait for you in Cancun. If you are up for it.. DO IT. Coco Bongo is AMAZING... i have never seen anything like it. Sooo soo much fun.. for all ages. They put on a show with impersonators etc and inbetween its a club atmosphere. The plaza just across the street from our resort is definately good for souveniers and shopping.. but be prepared because its hard to bargain for some reason with them. Alot of the pottery stuff they don't budge on. Be nice to them they work hard. Once again.. I go back to my previous entries where I say... YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. It is my job to sell travel and on a day to day basis people com ein looking for cheap cheap cheap, but luxury amazing hotels...If you want luxury you are going to pay for it. This is an average 4* hotel that does please.. and it was cheap so definately worth it... how can you complain about a tropical paradise like that. Beats being in the cold weather. In the end... if you are looking for Luxury.. and looking for people to kiss your feet... then stay home or go to a 5+* and spend more money. There will always be something to complain about if you look for it.. so just sit back and enjoy yourself... I would not recomend the hotel if it was crap because like I said before I sell travel for a living so it wouldn't be worth it for me to send somebody to a bad place. I would recomend it.

I had a problem with my a/c that they fixed for me. Guests: Mostly Italian the week that I was there. They are a very polite bunch of folks; I did have a language barrier. Not a problem though. It was interesting. Rooms/Garden areas: The grounds were lush and well maintained. I enjoyed walking around them daily. My room was average, clean and my fridge stocked. Food: The buffet food was good to me. Fish at night was good, along with fresh pasta, most everything that you could want. The fresh fruits and salads were good. They did not have grits for breakfast, so they get a black mark (just kidding). The dining hall was maintained well, but got warm sometimes as it is not air-conditioned. This was a small thing to me. Bring a big cup to put soft drinks/beer in for the bar at the beach. Miscellany: 1. I did not bring my laptop as it does not have wireless internet. I could have used the dataline on the phone I suppose. 2. Beach: Unfortunately no topless females this trip. The pool area required tops. I really enjoyed watching the ocean. 3. Getting to hotel from Cancun airport: Take the primera classe ADO bus (located in the airport) to Playa del Carmen (8 USD); then walk right outside and take a taxi (5 USD). ITS TOO EASY. ADO busses are clean and comfortable. 4. Tours: There is a Grayline tour Booth across the street from the hotel. Their comparable tours were cheaper than the hotel's. Grayline is a good tour company. You can check them out online. 5. Go downtown to Playa. I enjoyed walking around. Take a bike from the hotel. 6. I tipped 2 (USD) daily for room, left a tip at meals. I do not think that this is required. 7. Coffee drinkers. Without fail, I have never brought home fresh coffee beans. The beans were stale. I will not do this again. The coffee and expressos at the hotel were good. 8. Airport Purchases: In the secure area you can buy gifts, If they are liquids, they will be confiscated unless you buy them in the big duty-free area. I learned this the hard way. 9. What can you bring back foodwise? If you plan on bringing back food items, know before you go. Meats, bouillion, seed products may not be brought back. Search before you go. I understand that hard cheeses are usually acceptable. 10. Shopping Plaza across the street. This is a nice place to shop for souvenirs, etc. They have relatively inexpensive internet/telephone access. 11. If you plan to visit a waterpark, you will need to buy biodegradable suncreen if you use it. Just buy it down there. This is for environmentally sensitive areas. 12 (USD) for 4 oz..

Nice check-in, nice drink served to us while we checked in. The Bellhop Jesus was great. Took us around the entire property. The first day was Ok until we went to dinner at the buffet hall. I COULD NOT CHEW THE MEAT. The beef was so tough that it could not be chewed or cut with the butter knife supplied. The food was horrible. We went to make reservations the next day and were told that all the was available was the Italian Rest on Monday night. Everything was booked for Sunday and 2 of the restaurants were booked for Monday. So another 2 days of choking down food. The 24 hr (hahahaha) 20 hr snack area was basically rice, beans, fruit, burgers that were horrible, some various other crap and something that was suppossed to be a hot dog. The resort only served 1 TYPE OF BEER, Dos Equis. No domestic or foreign beer. I came to Mexico and couldn't get a CORONA at the resort!!!! Imagine that. The beer was only served in 10 oz plastic glasses. All the drinks were served this way. So you spent your night going back and forth to the bar to get a drink. Also there are only 2 bars in the entire resort. DO NOT DRINK THE WATER OR HAVE ANY ICED DRINKS!!!! We had the runs after 3 days. And we only had ice in drinks and frozen drinks. We never drank any water except from a closed sealed bottle. The pool closes at 8 PM. (no night swimming) The pool bar closes at 6PM. I thought this was a resort???? The beach area was beautiful except that it was mostly washed away which is not the hotel fault, otherwise the area of the beach was great. The service at the hotel was horrible. I called 3 times on Sunday to have bottled water sent to the room for the mini fridge there. No delivery. I called Monday 2 times, no delivery. The water showed up Tuesday. Well we had to check out 15 mins after it arrived. The room had cracks in the walls, dirty paint on the walls, mold and the bathroom was disgusting. The AC was so loud sleeping was tough. We had fruit one night and woke up in the morning to BUGS!!!! I needed to do some work on the internet and check into my flights as well. I paid for 2 hrs of internet time and it took that long for the computer to log into the website. I spoke with the manager at the front desk and asked if I could possibly just use a computer to sign into my flight and they told me that they have no internet access. YEAH RIGHT!!! The tall lady who works the gift shop was nasty. The brochure they gave us when they checked in said that if we needed any toiletries they would bring them to us. Well I asked for shaving cream which is listed in the list, I was told they don't have it. I asked what they had from the list and was told only a few items. They do have a stage for shows that are put on every night. The shows were pretty good given that the resort was not good. The grounds of the hotel are OK. One good thing was the 5th Ave area in Playa Del Carmen down near the ferries to Cozumel. The locals were great and found and bought some great silver items and clothing. The bars (End Zone & Tequilla Barrel) there were awesome with American Football in most places. Playa Del Carmen is BEAUTIFUL. But DO NOT stay at any Whyndham property.

On the resort itself they give you a choice of 1 buffet 1 snack and 3 a la carte restaurant , the first one is the Mexican (Don Diego), were you can eat incredible Fajitas , enchiladas etc.. I recommend the big plate of fajitas and for starter's the big boll of melted queso (cheese) with mushroom. The second one is the Italian (Miramar), were you can eat lasagne, ravioli etc... And for starter\u2019s crostini. The Third one is the Mediterranean (Portofino) were you can eat from Tortellini, steak, salmon, shrimp's etc... The snack buffet by the pool is awesome; you can eat pizza, burgers, hotdog, pasta, nachos, French fries, salad, soup, ice cream and more all day and night. You can also enjoy a cold beer or drink with popcorn at the Lobby bar. My wife and I really enjoyed the Jacuzzi by pool and also the actual relax pool for adults only.

The party of four included two teenage children. The flight was 11hrs(via Dublin) but provided good service, leg room on a Thomson Plane. Well worth the journey when you arrive in Playacar. No Visa required but an exit tax of \u00a340 cash pp was required when you leave Mexico. They do not accept credit cards. Recommend US dollars for spending money. The weather was fantastic so do pack factor 30 and above. The rainy season and hurricanes are a worry but we missed it. The rain was brief lasting only a few minutes. The adjoining rooms we had booked were basic, very clean and tidy. For a small tip the maid kept the childrens room spotless. The food was fantatic, and suitable for teenagers/vegetarians. It was always hot, varied and available on demand 24 hrs a day. The pizzas were amazing. The service of all staff was polite and no tips were expected but did help with very prompt supply. All inclusive worked for us, we did not starve or have to wait for drink refills. There was a variety of local alcoholic drinks and the standard was very good. Beach towel service also free. We did eat in the 2 A la carte restaurants on the complex and the Azteca down the road. The food was excellent with good service. It broke up the week at the buffet restaurant. You are allowed a single booking at each every week. The complex is very secure and the beach is fantastic, very clean and warm sea water. The water sport facilities were exceptional and free. The animation team worked hard on their routines late into the evening. They were extremely professional. They were always prompt for work, very helpful and friendly. The trips to Chichen Itza was breathtaking and hot. Take water and insect cream. The highlight was a brief stop at a sink hole in the jungle. Fantastic experience. The children swam with the Dolphins at Xel Ha and they loved it. We also went on a trip on a catameran to Isla Majeres and snorkeled in the afternoon. It was an experience but the staff will try to get you into their friends shops and expect a hefty tip. Thomson prices were ridiculous so we booked our trips at a hut outside the entrance to the hotel. We saved a fortune and sat on the bus with other travellers who had paid twice the price.

The bar staff worked constantly making cocktails and not once did they say thankyou to them!!!! Well that was my only complaint.

We were upgraded to an oceanview which was nice. Our room was close to the theater which gets very very loud at night but ends at around 11. Every Friday night I think they have a wonderful Mariachi band and little games and stuff which was really fun! The room is a basic room with a hard bed but I have yet to experience a bed in a hotel that I liked. The Air conditioner is loud but it worked and that was important.

While there were some strong winds and rain for a day or two, there was very little problem in PDC and Cancun so the only inconvenience we had was that, probably due to a number of trip cancellations, the flights to Cancun from Montreal and Toronto were combined, making for a much longer flight than planned. Annoying but we made it there and back in one piece with no other problems. The Viva Maya was really great. The rooms are definitely not first class- very basic indeed and people are right in saying that the place is a bit worn and run down and could use a renovation. This didn't detract from our vacation in any way as we were there for fun, food and beach- not the room. But our room did not have an iron or mini fridge and as everyone has said, no place to store your clothes. I put my suitcase on a chair and it was fine. Small but decent balcony, AC always worked and even on the lowest setting, was quite cool. ALWAYS had hot water and we bathed at various times of the day. Service was EXCELLENT. We couldn't figure out the safe the first day and phoned down to the front desk- someone was there in 5 minutes. On another day, our sink got clogged. Again we phoned down to let them know- it wasn't urgent- and I had barely hung up the phone when someone was there to come fix it. Service was really excellent. The front desk and guest services people were really delightful (e.g. I lost my all inclusive bracelet and they gave me a new one no problem). We ate at a number of the a la carte restaurants at the Maya and Azteca and didn't have a problem getting reservations. The hotel was not at high season, however, but we would go and see what was available after breakfast around 9 or 10 and there was always a selection. Bamboo, the Japanese restaurant at the Azteca, was always full so if you are keen on that, you might want to try to get there earlier. You can book the Maya restaurants ahead but if you want to eat at the Azteca, you can only make reservations for the day of. Our fave was the Mexican restaurant at the Maya. The servers are sooo professional and super nice, went out of their way (please leave a nice tips- the majority of guests are European and don't leave tips at all and these people work so hard)- the food was really spectacular. The portions were big. They were eager to get us more drinks, tequila shots, get us special Mexican coffees at the end of our meal. The Mediterranean restaurant Portofino was also very tasty and had good service (more formal environment)- the portions were a little smaller but still satisfying. The snack bar by the beach always had fresh pizza, pasta, salad, fruit, ice cream, fries, nachos and cheese and a rotating list of meats (ribs, meatballs etc.) that you could help yourself to. We ate lunch from there most of the time so we didn't have to abandon the beach or get dressed. The buffet was adequate though I am not super keen on buffets. There was always fruit, salad bar, made to order meats and fish and usually pasta to order station at night and omelet to order for breakfast. At the Azteca, we ate at the Maya restaurant- it was a pretty unique menu, good service, but no AC so it was pretty hot (and we found the music a little odd). The Italian restaurant at the Azteca was tasty as well. The Azteca is five hotels down in Playacar, a nice 10 minute stroll from the hotel. The hotel grounds themselves are pretty compact but spread out enough that you don't feel crowded in (the Azteca had that feel to me). The Maya pool is pretty small and has a lot of activities throughout the day. I prefer the beach anyway (again no problem finding chairs though I don't like palapas). The adult pool is way in the back and is nice for end of the day relaxing (though people have a hard time understanding what NO KIDS means). Beach was really nice. Had no problem making use of the water sports facilities. Yair, one of the staff on the beach, is a SWEETHEART and took us out on the hobie cats several times. You can take them out on your own if you are comfortable. There were also kayaks and boogie boards. If you go south down the beach after about 15 minutes you will find there are no more hotels and lots of virgin beach to explore. Lots of topless women on the beach as the clientele in PDC is very European- Italian, French, German, Dutch for the most part. There are lots of people hawking services and activities on the beach- you can easily go parasailing (about $40 US a person I heard) or get a tour to Isla de Mujeres or Chichen Itza for much cheaper than the hotel price (again around $30-40). We didn't do them so I have no idea how the quality is. Town of PDC is great. You can walk along the road in Playacar into town in about half an hour (but its hot!). Every hour on the hour until 4 pm, there is a hotel shuttle that goes to a beach club in town that is one block off of Quinta Avenida. The animation team had a good mix of young people from all over. At least one person in the team speaks English, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, German... they tend to bug you a bit to participate (perhaps us more because we are younger, late 20s and early 30s) and I never wanted to so that was a bit annoying. If you want, they have morning stretching, aqua gym, dance classes, spanish classes, water polo tournaments, belly dancing etc. throughout the day. They put on shows every night (these guys are not pros but work so hard and a lot of the shows can be quite fun) and are on site until about midnight. At least some of them will go out on a nightly basis to whatever bar is happening that night. We really enjoyed Mambo Cafe as it is a latin dance bar (salsa, merengue, bachata and some reggaeton). It is $5 cover. We also had a good time at Bali which is a more European style dance club. Wednesdays ladies get in and drink for free until 2 am. It is $10 cover otherwise or $35 for open bar all night. Taxis into town and from PDC to Playacar are $5 or 50 pesos. Always confirm but this is standard. If you share a ride with an animator and don't want to pay for them, be clear. It is an extra $5 for taxi to drop animators off at their digs (and they may try to get a free ride based on your ignorance of the extra costs). They were all nice people with the exception of the Assistant Head of Animation who was extremely outrageously rude and was pretty annoyed by guests (probably time to find another type of job). I should have complained to Guest Services about him because it was THAT bad (and we are both fluent in Spanish and pretty fun easy going people- never complained about a thing) but didn't bother to in the end. The resort had a good vibe for couples, families and young adults such as ourselves. I was embarrassed by how RUDE the few other Canadians staying there were but overall it was a pleasant environment. I definitely recommend this place for more budget travelers- the Maya exceeded our expectations.", "Date": "September 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "essex uk", "Title": "\u201cfantastic love this hotel\u201d", "Author": "geekiej", "ReviewID": "UR8669289", "Content": "we have just returned from 2 weeks at the via maya and had a great time for the second year running.we arrived 2 days after hurricane dean and although the hotel had taken down fixtures and fittings they worked hard to restore the hotel and within 2 days everything was back to normal. when you read other reviews it worries you but i have to say we love this place the staff are very friendly the place is clean and the food good.the staff work so hard they are tending gardens sweeping and cleaning all day , the waiters cannot do enough to help and by the end of the first week they remember what you are drinking i think it helps that as english we are very polite compared to the rest of our european neighbours who demand and never say please or thank you.one night i did not like the cake in the resturant and happened to ask if they had any others they went to one of the themed resturants to get me some i liked now thats service! down side to many italians , and since last year animacion staff donot seem to cater for teenagers therefore there is an age gap of some 6 years where no organised stuff for them to do all though one of the entertainments team ludvic was great with our kids .there are many activities to do but we wanted to rest even though they knew this the entertainment team would still ask us to join in i think to make you feel part of it although some of the male entertainment staff only spoke to young attractive females !! michael jackson night fantastic the head of entertainment plays michael he was brilliant so professional although not all evening shows were good they seem to repeat them to soon and some nights not very organised having said that our 10 year old and our friends 13 year old lived for the nightly shows and spent the next day lauughing about the shows and talking about them. this place is a 3 star hotel smaller than others in the area but friendly , clean and a great place to stay the beach is the best in the area and those people that complain must just be miserable moany people as we have been for last 2 years and think its great and have not had any problems we feel more 4 star than 3 .on the way home we spoke to people who had stayed at higer starred hotels and they were complaining so there is always people who wont like a place give viva maya a chance go with open mind we love it would go back again.", "Date": "September 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CT", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Great Staff alot of fun, even with a Hurricane!\u201d", "Author": "jdawg55", "ReviewID": "UR8661716", "Content": "Every Year my Parents bring my sister and I on Vacation and this year we chose mexico and to stay at the Viva Wyndam Maya! we had a fabulous time and met amazing people.

So we thought, why not go to Mexico? It's not as popular in the summer as in the winter. I looked online and found this place to be a good price. And it did end up being a good value for the price. A few things to mention not otherwise noted in other reviews: Rooms: There are different room types. I'm not talking about junior suites verses regular rooms. There is a newer building next to the adult only pool that has much nicer rooms. So some reviews talk about mini bars/refrigerators, coffee makers, alarm clocks, double sinks, and closets with shelving. These are the rooms only in this building. They are also much nicer in the lighting, bed spreads, overall make-up. Although, yes, as another reviewer mentioned, the doors have a hard time locking. The other rooms in the other buildings do not have all these amenities and they are not as nice overall but they are fine if you come in with the right expectations. I mean, who needs a mini-bar anyways when you have the bar down the way to enjoy all inclusive drinks? You can take them back to your room. Probably the reason the rooms seem not as attractive is that they are concrete and poorly painted. I'm glad they are concrete, good for storms! and with a fresh coat of paint and some sprucing up they'd look a lot better. But they are very clean and they do the job. Topless beaches: Europeans may be used to this but I'm not and when i read this was a family friendly place, i was surprised to arrive and find that they allowed women to go topless at the beaches. I'm not a fan, and that info. is an FYI for you as you consider this place. It's not just this hotel, however. We walked along the beach and continued to find that all the hotels allowed topless beaches although at our hotel they did not allow topless at the pool. We went to Puerto Vallarta in the winter in the past and didn't see anyone topless. Less europeans in the winter? Puerta Vallarta? Or maybe it was because we were at a super nice resorts where mostly older american adults go? Staff: The staff were great. They served us well. We were there during the time that Hurricane Dean was travelling through and fortunately it didn't hit, but the hotel took excellent precautions anways. They tied things down, boarded up rooms and kept us in a special building during the night of the storm. all this, they did with a smile and saying \"don't worry.\" but also giving us the necessary information to make a wise decision. We def. did not hear a lot of english in this hotel. It caters a lot to europeans and the staff speak more spanish than english. We love the variety. but we are glad we could speak some spanish. The staff likes it when you try. We found that the wait staff could speak english but the housekeeping staff that we encountered could not. Bring a dictionary if you need any help. Food: Don diego, Portofino, Miramare are all great. The portions are small compared to in the U.S. but they are perfect sizes. Rich, yummy, beautifully plated food. You do need to make reservations right away. We made reservations for three days right when we got there. The buffet you eat at for all your meals (unless you get a reservation) is good. They have a create your own pasta bar for lunch and dinner and omelettes in the morning. And they even had lobster one night for dinner. Have 1 person stay at your table at a time when you go back to the buffet. My husband and I both got up at once for seconds and when we came back the table had been cleared and re-set already. they're fast! There are just so many people in this place that they don't know if you are coming back to your table or not. There is a Viva Azteca Wyndham down the street you can go to for free.

I saw a negative review about a wedding here and I just wanted to let everyone know of my experience. First of all, YOU ARE IN MEXICO, a different country. If you want to get married and want complete controll, then stay home and do it there. My husband and I had decided that we just wanted to be married on the beautiful turquoise beach in the Yucatan , after we had gotten engaged in Cancun. We decided on Playa del Carmen. We did alot of research about the different hotels and had picked the Maya on their price and ammenities. We had a group of 17 people including 5 children between the ages of 5 and 12. It was a wonderful vacation!! Everyone fully enjoyed their stay at the Maya . We went down there not knowing what to expect , and they managed to pull it off without a hitch. It is true that the beach( at least in February) is not much there, but they are working very hard to bring it back. These people spent every day dredging sand from out into the sea to make a beach. The beach doubled in size from one day to the next. And it is true the kids had a blast on the sandbags!! The entertainment was overall pretty good. It was the highlight of my childrens vacation. They loved the fact that they were included in the beginning of each nights performances and looked forward to the beginning of the shows each night. They still talk about the shows six months later. Now to the wedding.. The wedding coordinator Sandra (if she's still there) was absolutely amazing. When we arrived, we told her that we wanted to be married on the beach. At that time the beach had been eroded and she told us that there were other places on the grounds that we could have the ceremony. We had already found a spot that we wanted to have the ceremony(sandbags and all) that overlooked the Carribean Sea. She obliged and said that they would do what they could for the spot. I watched over the next three days as many workers tried to get the spot that we had wanted to look good for our wedding. They did an INCREDIBLE job. Our ceremony was absolutely perfect and the staff did an amazing job. I went in expecting very little and my wedding was absolutely perfect. The wedding took about 4 hours out of our vacation time, from start to finish. Bottom line: This is a great resort for the money. We had stayed at a Riu Palace in Cancun and this trip was definately more enjoyable and affordable. I would definately recommend this resort to anyone looking to go to the Riviera Maya.", "Date": "August 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cParadise !!!!!\u201d", "Author": "travellerdeb", "ReviewID": "UR8489264", "Content": "We stayed for two weeks at this paradise on earth.

However, as we pulled up, our bags were taken, welcome drinks were offered, check in was a breeze and we immediately felt much better about our choice. We had joined the Viva By Request and called a few days before arrival to see if we had an ocean front room. When we called we were in garden view, however, we ended up being literally 5 steps to the sand. We could see the lights of Cozumel and passing cruise ships in the distance from our patio at night. Here is our honest opinions about different aspects of the resort. Food: The buffet was great. We ate most meals there, and never tired of the food. We also ate at the pool snack bar several times. The a la carts were a little strange. We ended up with reservations for our last three nights. Apparently that is all they had. Like other people mentioned though, the restaurants are empty. I think they do that to give each table their own waiter. The service was excellent at all three a la carts. My daughter dropped her napkin, and before she could bend down to pick it up, two waiters were there to get it for her! My only reccommendations for food/drinks would be perhaps add another bar. Sometimes you had to wait several minutes for drinks. We would have also liked the pool snack bar to have been open 24 hours. Room: Our room was very clean and had a great view. It did lack storage. There was no dresser, only the closet and a few shelves. Yes, the mattresses are very hard, but we have been to other resorts in Mexico and have found that at all of them. The minibar was filled everyday. We even left a note requesting specific drinks and it was always honored. Maid service was fine as well. Beach: The beach was great. Yes, there are sandbags, but there is still plenty of access to the water. My daughter and her dad had a great time diving off of them. We jogged on the beach one morning, and most of the beaches, including ones at more upsclae resorts, were a lot worse off then this one. There were plenty of chairs. We never hit the beach before noon, and were always able to find 3 together. Spa and other amentities: My daughter and I used the spa for several services; massage, manicures, pedicures, and henna tatoos. The staff was great and getting appointments was easy. They also had a fairly decent gym, however it was not air conditioned. But you are going to sweat anyways, so it wasn't a big deal. I used it twice. My daughter used the computers/ internet several times and never had any problem accessing them, and it was very reasonably priced. We kayaked and used the boogie boards. No, they don't have a ton of these things, but whenever we wanted to use them, we never had to wait more than 30 minutes. We also used the bikes at the resort. Playacar is nice for biking. The bikes aren't the greatest, and we had to take one back for a broken pedal, but no big deal. The location itself was also very nice. Right at the end of the drive were shops. It was then only a 25 minute walk or $5 cab ride into Playa. Anybody considering this resort, do not hesitate to book it. It is a great resort for the money.

First know this. .We went there to get married.. And succeeded in our task.. The rest.. Well.. read on.. Accomodations The room is fine.. We were in the honeymoon suite (or so it would seem).. No real issue with the room except the TV.. But we are on vacation getting married.. no need for TV... Staff They were generally pleseant but we had a couple issues.. First with the reservations for their a la carte restaurants.. We got none. We did get them in the wedding package. That was on the day before we left.. But the other days. NOTHING. Despite trying on Wed morning to book them for the week. After complaining I was put on a waiting list and never contacted again.. Keep in mind that the restaurants were all EMPTY the entire time.. Another member of the staff actually had the audacity to say he wanted a tip for moving our bags.. I understand that at some time, its ok to give tips but I do feel you have to earn them.. If I have to move my bags all over, and all you did was cart them while I loaded them onto your cart and into my rental car, I dont really feel you did YOUR job.. Shows/Entertainment LOUD and annoying. Want a beach view? Hope for somewhere away from the middle where the pool and main center are.. It gets way too loud there.. No where near worth it.. The start their entertainment at 9pm with little kids.. 9pm!! our kids were up in bed by that time.. we were trying to pass out by 10 when they are up to the adult entertainment (louder music).. Activities There were supposed to be some all inclusive no cost activities.. Snorkling - We were unable to secure equipment for 2 of our guests (we all Scuba and have our own gear). So as a group, we could not snorkle because we were told that they have \"many people on their snorkle trip\".. So if they had paid to go snorkling, they may have had a chance.. but for free? nope. Kyaking - enjoy this activity as long as your arms hold out.. Catamaran - Always booked and when they werent, if you didnt know how to they wouldnt let you use them. They would ask you to come at some inconvienient time to learn.. Windsurfing - they had 1 to use.. My wife used to do this often.. They tried to talk her out of it for quite some time before relenting and letting her go out and have some fun.. Body boards - They had about 8 of these.. Good luck getting one.. Beach There is a beach. They do have HUGE sandbags on them.. You may find yourself bumping into them as you cannot see clearly in the surf.. All the way from shore to about 40ft out, the sand is stirred up so much in the surf that visibility is 0.. With my scuba gear, I bumped into a few people in only thigh deep water and neither of us had a clue the other were there. You can PAY to do other activities but they are over priced and generally not worth it.. Parasailing normally involves a moving boat.. They have perfected this non moving parasailing experience.. They string you out like a kite then reel you back in.. wow. fun. NOT. Jetskis? $60 per 30 min. Scuba No shore diving unless you go to the actual air supplier and rent tanks from him. The dive shop will not allow any shore dives because, of course, you are not spending lots of $ with them. We figured it would only cost us $10usd more to go to Cozumel and dive with our usual group (Del Mar Aquatics) than to spend any $ with Scuba Caribe.. This was a real chore as I had to find the place, rent the tanks and transport them to the hotel and ultimately my room.. Food I am fairly picky and only like chicken breast.. Grilled.. simple.. But I was always waiting quite a bit (think almost 15 min) to get my food. And since it was a buffet, I had to stand there waiting.. Wedding Lacked any communication.. I gave them music. They didnt ask me which songs to play and just played whatever. Not good. The hotel photographer was rude and lacked any skill. Later, when we stated we didnt like nearly all of his 400 pictures and we were not going to pay the $300usd to buy them, he walked off and let his co worker deal with us, she in turn then put all the pictures in a folder and simply asked us keep or delete till we were left with the 10 we had \"included\" in the package. Breakfast the following morning.. I was told by the wedding coordinator that we would have breakfast in bed.. By 8am nothing. I called down and they stated that the hotel did not offer this ever. By 830am, we were resolved to heading to the buffet as usual when we get a call saying they were bringing up our food. I was rather annoyed at this. If you are the type of person that enjoys getting drunk and sitting around, then this may be your type of place.. If, however, you prefer to do something, then go to cozumel and have more fun. This is the last time I visit Playa Del Carmen. We will celebrate our future aniversaries in Cozumel. Pool - Open from 8am to 8pm.. I dont know about you, but I prefer late night swims.. Not only could you not swim in the pool past 8pm, you could not enter the beach at night either... We are both certified scuba divers and enjoy a little night dive here and there.. I dont feel they ever try to help you unless you are willing to part with more money.. After having paid for all inclusive, I didnt feel I should have to pay more for what was supposed to be included..", "Date": "August 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAwesome hotel for money paid!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "micktoria", "ReviewID": "UR8367009", "Content": "Do not be put off by negative reviews unless you are looking for a 5 star resort.

I have to admit after reading some of the reviews (after booking our trip) I was a bit concerned. However, we decided we were going to go and have a great vacation and judge the stay for ourselves. We traveled with our 2 adult daughters (19 & 24) and had 2 rooms. I joined the Wyndham by Request Club shortly before going just because it was free and offered some special concessions for members, such as a free room upgrade (if available). When we arrived we were greeted by a very personable Bellman who gathered our bags and directed us to the reception desk. I asked for a free room upgrade and was told that we had upgraded rooms already assigned. He didn't say, but it was obvious that the club membership had done that for us. The English speaking at the front desk was a little poor at times during our stay but that doesn't bother us because WE ARE IN MEXICO. So I expect a little language barrier at times. Therefore It doesn't upset us. They were always pleasant and got the job done. Our bellman, Jesus, escorted us to our rooms and gave us a little orientation of the resort as we walked. He was great! And, the information was very helpful. It was about 7:00 by then so we went to dinner at the main buffet and then took a stroll down to the beach and then took in the evening show. We enjoyed each show we attended. Yes, they are done by young people in their late teens & early 20's but they were enjoyable. During the day these same staff provide most of the activities and entertainment as well so you get to know them a bit and that makes it even more fun to watch them in the shows. We have stayed at a pricier resort in Playa before and I will admit that the shows were a little more professional and the buffet was slightly better but for the difference in price we were very pleased over all. We found the buffet to be better than anticipated. They had a wide selection each day and always had something new for you to try. The dining staff were always very courteous and kept our table cleaned up. The best restaurant is Portofino, the Mediteranean restaurant. Wow! Great food and service. It was a special place to dine. The restaurants are small and do book up fast. We were also able to schedule the Mexican restaurant at the Azteca. Also very good. It actually had more Mayan than Mexican dishes. Also a great evening dining. Service also was great! The buffet at the pool bar was good but not spectacular. Still it was more than what I expected. Basically snack food. Bars. The bar by the mail lobby was very good. The bartenders there would work with you and were very pleasant. The bartenders at the pool bar weren't unfriendly, they just didn't seem to interact very well with the guests. This bar could use some more fun injected into it. They need to have the main bar staff go down there and train them a little. Pool was great. Very clean and well kept. The beach has been rebuilt and they work on it every day by pumping sand out of the ocean onto the beach. The big sandbags help a lot and didn't really bother us. There was plenty of room to swim and relax. They could use more umbrellas though. Back to our rooms. We had a King size bed adjoining our daughters room with 2 Queens. Both rooms were very nice. We stepped out of our patio onto the beack. Great room! Housecleaning did a good job. Could have done a little better restocking the fridge but it was okay. We had no problem with missing items and felt secure. We always used the safe though as a precaution. Overall , we had a very enjoyable vacation and would not only recommend the Viva Wyndham Maya to others but would book it again. For the money it was more than we expected. Go with a possitive attitude, be kind to the staff, ask for things if you need them, and have a great vacation. By the way, do the dolphin excursion to Isla Mejeras.

First, I want to take a second to thank all the past guests to Viva Maya for their insightful descriptions and reviews, since I had gotten such great tips and ideas from them. It was also very beneficial being able to know what to expect at a resort prior to arriving. My boyfriend & I just came back from Viva Maya about three days ago and we felt the need to give our own review. We are both college students and booked Viva Wyndham for it\u2019s reasonable price per person per night and the amenities the resort included every day. We booked it off Bookit.com & picked the Playa Del Carmen area since there was a number of bars to attend during the night but during the day, it wasn\u2019t a \u201cSpring Break type\u201d constant party atmosphere. After arriving at the airport, we spotted a Bookit.com/ Best Day Travel agent who should have had our trip package and our names but it turns out our transportation reservations didn\u2019t even exist. After waiting about 45 minutes, the agent made a few phone calls & he put us in a van, & then loaded 6 more people in the already small vehicle. I thought we were going to get driven straight to our hotel but we needed to make 5 stops. After an hour & a half we finally arrived at the Viva Maya, and we were greeted with two welcome cocktails and someone to carry our bags to our room. We arrived on a Monday, & I guess the Europeans fly in at the beginning of the week because it felt like we were two of very limited English speaking guests. We paid for a garden balcony view since it was thirty dollars cheaper a night but when we unpacked we had a view of the ocean, a lot of privacy & great sunlight. We asked for one king bed but got two queens & when we asked to possibly change rooms they said they\u2019ll try but they didn\u2019t think they could. If it was our honeymoon, that would have been a different story but we ended up keeping our luggage on the unused bed since there was no armoire. We had a small safe inside our closet which we could make our own combination so we kept our money, passports and other important belongings in there. Our refrigerator only had one bottle of water so after calling twice, we finally got soda cans and a few bottles of water the day later. The maid services were all very nice & greeted us with \u201cholas\u201d every time we passed them. We are not usually paranoid travelers but we constantly kept all our important belongings inside the safe when we left the room and actually put locks on our luggage, which was a great idea we got from a prior Viva Maya guest. One night we went left the room to go to the disco & we were rushing so my boyfriend had no time to lock up his RayBan sunglasses in the safe so he left them on the counter. We also put the Do Not Disturb door hanger up so we knew the maid service would not enter. When my boyfriend went to look for his glasses the next morning they were gone. He usually doesn\u2019t misplace things and has never dropped or forgotten something behind in his entire life so we knew they were probably taken. When we walked down to the Guest Services desk, we struck up a conversation with some guests who also said that there were some things stolen from their room as well. I doubt it was coincidence that two rooms both had things taken within a 24-hour period. We also needed to bring our own body soap, shampoo & conditioner since they only provided hand soap. The hotel grounds were actually very pretty & they do keep it nicely landscaped & the pools were always kept clean & beautiful. The water never once bothered us, which we expected to get sick off of. Every hallway offered water coolers that you can refill your bottles with. The food is something I need to absolutely bring up. First off all the websites say this resort is All Inclusive which means you can drink & eat all you want which I must tell you it is NOT TRUE. There was a bar in the front near the lobby, which was open 24/7 & a bar at the pool area, which was attached to the Swim up Bar. There were small tables set up near the outside bar & pool which is the only food you can eat when the buffet is not open. The outside buffet consists of moldy pizza, uncooked fries & some Mexican dishes like rice & beans, inedible hamburgers & hotdogs, chips & some cold salads. That\u2019s it. We literally starved during the day. The Buffet was open for Breakfast: 8- 11am, Lunch: 12- 3am & Dinner: 6- 10pm. This Buffet was probably the worst part of the hotel. The breakfast was edible, having a wide variety of fruits, cereal, puff pastries, breads, pancakes and eggs. We are big cereal eaters & when we got to the buffet there was usually no more milk left to dispense so it became a little annoying having to track a staff person down to bring us a cup of milk. My boyfriend & I are by no means, morning people and it is usually a struggle to get up by 9am so to have to wake up before the breakfast buffet closed was unpleasant but you could take food out if you got a plastic plate. You also need to sneak out utensils because if they see you walking out with anything that\u2019s not plastic, they will stop you. We were usually on an excursion during the day so I think we went to lunch once or twice during the week. They cater a lot to the European guests having mostly typical European dishes. We are not picky eaters, but we usually went to bed hungry after dinner. The first three nights we could not eat a single thing, between moldy bread & vegetables, overcooked pasta & undercooked poultry & meat. The staff that cleaned the tables were also nasty, I had one guy tell me after not finishing a bowl of pasta that there were starving children in Africa who would do anything to finish all the food offered to them. The three a la carte restaurants never had open reservations but when we passed by them during the night they were usually pretty empty. We had three chances to eat a la carte but only got to use one of them which really disappointed us. We got reservations to the Italian \u201crestaurant\u201d called Portofino located right behind the stage. The food there was very good & even though the portions were small we wish we could have eaten there more than once. The staff at the restaurant was a 100 times better here as well. Viva Wyndham Azteca was a ten-minute walk down the street & by having your mandatory Wyndham bracelet on at all times, you could use almost everything at the Azteca. We walked over there a couple of times to eat and use their bars and outside buffets. The food was much better there, having a lot more variety & catering more for our American tastes. We preferred the beach at the Maya & the pool was cleaner at Maya as well. We went on two excursions that we booked through our Best Day travel agent when we got to the hotel. They were really fun & pretty reasonably priced. We spent a lot of time at the Playacar town, which was right across the street from Viva Maya. It\u2019s smaller than 5th Ave & served it\u2019s purpose but I definitely recommend anyone to take the $5 (50 pasos) taxi ride downtown. Before getting in any cab, make sure you ask them it will only cost that set amount to prevent them from taking advantage of you. We walked there a couple of times but during the day it gets too hot so taxis are usually easy to flag down on the main road. We had great weather down there; it rained for only two hours one day which I think was necessary since it was in the 90\u2019s that day. The beach was beautiful & we really did have one of the largest beaches. The sandbags were definitely needed but didn\u2019t seem to both anyone. People actually used them to their advantage, using it to dive off of and play on. We had no problems finding seats but we did find it difficult finding chairs under umbrellas. The entertainment was absolutely fabulous. They consisted of mostly college students, from around the world. They always kept the guests busy, having little contests during the day like volleyball, salsa dancing classes, bingo & my boyfriend\u2019s favorite, water polo. They put on great shows at night, which was no Broadway but were very cute & everyone seemed to really enjoy them. So to make this review longer than it already is, would I recommend this hotel? Maybe to someone I didn\u2019t like. The pictures on all the websites of Viva Maya will mislead you, because we did not see half of those places pictured. You have to understand this Wyndham is a no frills, borderline 2/3 star resort, & you must expect the food is just a hairline above edible.

Therefore, not wanting to go back into Playa del Carmen, I looked into all inclusive resorts for the day. They were all very expensive, however, the Viva for one person for one night was only about $119.00. I did not spend the night, but it was nice to have a place to spend the day and part of the evening that included food and drink. The food was nothing to brag about, and I don't know if I would want to spend a week there because of this, but the resort was very nice and all the workers were hospitable and helpful. Directly across the street was a shopping area where I was able to purchase souveniers without going into town. Much of the beach is gone and the sandbags are huge, however, their pool was clean and refreshing and there were plenty of chairs on what beach was left. The room included many amenities that you don't receive in higher priced resorts, such as, bedroom slippers (could keep), robes (could not keep); refrigerator stocked with beer, soda, water and bottle of wine w/two lovely wine glasses. They also left a large plate of fruit. Many bathroom amenities. I would definitely recommend this for a one day stay while on cruise or for a few days because of the lack of good food, but for the price it was an excellent choice for me.", "Date": "June 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Darlington, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cwonderful holiday\u201d", "Author": "kathtravelbug", "ReviewID": "UR7790688", "Content": "After booking first and then reading reviews on trip advisor that weren't too good we went with mixed feelings.our holiday was wonderful i am pleased tosay.the hotelhad sustained damage to the beach thanks to Katrina but this was being restored very successfully and there was enough beach for all guests to enjoy. the hotel gardens were a joy to wander through,rooms were very clean but some perhaps a little basic for some tastes but fine for me.the buffet restaurants supplied us with a huge choice of very nicely prepared food with staff that worked very hard and the three speciality restaurants were superb.We didn't encounter any problems booking these and we could also use the speciality restaurants at the sister hotel the Azteca just ten minutes walk away whicj gave even more choice of food.The beach and pool at this hotel could also be used but i actually preferred the beach at the Wyndham maya.The entertainments team worked very hard with all activities including dance and spanish lessons plus their evening shows were good entertainment.

It is beautiful, building and landscape wise but the service leaves a lot to be desired. We booked an excursion to Chichen Itza with the hotel and they basically lied about the timing. It took us 5 hours to get there when we were told 3. By the time we got back it was quite late and so the day was over. The service was on the bad side. The staff does not listen! No matter what is requested, they get it wrong. Forget about opening and closing hours for the restaurants, bars and the gift shop, they do so as they wish. They have 3 restaurants that take reservations only but they NEVER have room, yet when you walk by they are barely half full! We tried to make reservations several times, and many others staying there had the same experience. They must not want people to return. We figured that since the beaches are a mess and they are losing money, they want you to eat in the buffet so their cost per meal is less. Suggestion: Go to the Wyndham Azteca, a few resorts over and eat at their buffet if you have to, it's much better all around. (Don't try to make reservations at the restaurant there though, it's always \"booked\" too) To get an idea about how bad the food is: there is cut up hot dog in EVERYTHING. On pizza, in pasta salad, scrambled eggs and served for breakfast. They must take the leftovers from the pool bar the night before and re-use them. The drinks are pretty weak as well, so ask for a strong one. Stay away from the disco too, horrible. If you can do without a beach and bad food, stay here.

We got to the hotel, they helped us on how to check in where to leave our bags, got us a drink. Had our bags carried to our room and WOW the ocean is sooo beautiful. We had a beach view overlooking the the stage area, and pool. Our room was almost too cold at night with the air conditioner and had to turn it down. The bar tenders were awsome, funny and were willing to make suggestions on drinks and would make you anything you wanted. The resort employees were smiling and say hola all the time. The beach is sooo nice and lots of chairs,, the pool was harder to find a chair by. The staff tried to get everyone involved in activities, walking down the beach and going around the pool recruting people. The buffet was bleek and got sick of eating there by the end of the week. The resturants were romantic, but we didnt bring dates, almost too romantic. We even ate at the mexican resutant at the sister resort, wich has a great garden view, recomended. I wish we ate at the resurants more but you have to book in the morining and fight the hangover to get to front desk to book. I wish the bar was open 24hrs, but still was nice. Lots of fresh mellon to eat all the time. Dico was pretty lame, and the shows were okay, but kinda lame. Very humid. Went to chiz a netza for the fall equinox, is a good place to buy your suvaneers-gifts- was the cheapest place. I bough a mask before that for about $20 haggled down from 40, and at chiz a netza i got a mask and a stone calander for $10, lots of things to buy and very cheap... recomend shopping around cause the same stuff in town is repeated amongst shops. Would probably stay here again, but might look for something a bit better. Was very good for our price, we flew out of seattle stoped in denver, then to cancun. Flying out of seattle probably saved us $400 on our flight, but was a pain in the but getting home. We traveld for 23hrs on our way back as we missed the air port shuttle to vancouver and had to take the greyhound. but overall the trip cost $1200 for 8days 7nights. Plus $30 to train to seattle and $20 to bus back, and cab fair. Will fly from vancouver next time. Good for singles- met lots of guys from all over. Buffet is basic- recomend the omlets for breckfast and mellon resturants-romantic good for couples water sports- we body borded and snorkled- fun!

We bought our membership in 2001. We upgraded our membership in 2002 when we found out that what we were told we had bought and what we actually got were two different things! Anyway, we have always had a pretty good time at the Viva Maya. We stayed once at the Viva Azteca which was fine for the adults but boring for teenage boys. Therefore, we always try to stay at the Viva Maya. Our trip in June, 2004 was for our 25th wedding anniversary. I had made reservations 18 months in advance and had even CALLED the resort to make sure that everything would be taken care of. We took our entire immediate family with grandchildren and friends of our young adult sons as well. We were a group of 16. When we got there, the rooms we had requested were not available. They put some of our kids on one side of the resort and the adults on the other side. We had requested the first floor because of health problems for my spouse. We got the third floor!! I was very upset about how we were treated. We went to the Viva Vacation Club office and tried to get help. There was only one person who was willing to help but he was not in a position of authority. I was so upset over our treatment and not getting what had been requested, that I called the Wyndham Corporate Offices to try to get some help. Our children finally told me to forget about it and try to have some fun since it was our wedding anniversary. We did the best we could. There were many days where we didn't get any towels to bathe with. The front desk staff was horrible. I will say that we always had good food and drink when we stayed there. Since we have upgraded our membership (again) in 2003, we were supposed to have bonus weeks. Somehow, when we requested them, they were no longer available. Change in management staff at the Vacation Club office. Now, we constantly get phone calls wanting us to change our weeks membership to a point system. Of course, it will cost us another $8,000-$10,000. Since we haven't had but a few good experiences with the Club, we decided to keep it as we have it for the time being. We will return to Playa del Carmen again in June, 2007. We will be staying at another resort. We booked through Funjet. We will again be traveling with approx. 14 people in our group. We still got a better deal at a better AI resort than using our weeks and paying $350/pp AI fee, and the room fees since we would have to book several rooms. Also, with the airfare being higher these days, it was not economical to stay at the Viva Maya. I certainly hope that the Viva Vacation Club will try to take better care of their members who have paid all of the membership in full in the future. If not, there are many companies who are willing to buy their membership.

We just came back from a vacation at the Viva Wyndham Maya and can honestly say that I am less than impressed. We found the room we had in less than perfect condition. The closet door would not stay shut because it was missing a clasp, the phone didn't work, the bathroom fan didn't work, we had no fridge and room service was hit and miss (sometimes you got the right towels and sometimes you didn't). The ala cartes left a lot to be desired. The only one that was worth whle was the Mexican themed one. The main resteraunt (buffet) was average. Lots of food but nothing fancy or really different to what you would get here in Canada and man was it crowded. The pool area and bar is vastly over crowded. The pool itself is in need of repair/maintenance. My son cut his hand on one of the may broken tiles on the edge of the pool. The bar is extremely busy and doesn't particularly cater to small kids. If loud, drunk teenageres are your thing, then this is the place for you. The beach.......Hurrican Willma certainly took it's toll on the beaches. They look nothing like the show in the adds.

Although we traveled a fair bit, this was our first all inclusive vacation. Our two kids (14 and 16) were getting tired of the museum and cultural scenes, hence the decision to give AI a try. I must admit overall it was not a bad experience, except for me I got bored after about three days - you could only eat, suntan, relax or read so much. TRANSPORTATION We booked the vacation through Expedia and did not include land transport. Instead, when we arrived at the Cancun Airport, we took the ADO bus (an ADO bus counter on the right hand side before you get out of the door) which ran hourly and the fare was appr. US$8, the schedule was accurate and it took exactly one hour to Playa del Carmen, from there we took a cab ($5) to the hotel. FRONT DESK When we arrived at the hotel, they had a mix up with my first name (my middle name became the first name) and we had to wait for about 30 minutes before we got our room. The staff was very friendly and drinks were served during our wait. We thoroughly enjoyed the view of the courtyard as well as people watching. The clientele was mostly European, Americans and Canadians and during our stay we did not encounter any rude or obnoxious behavior. Since we booked our package through Expedia, even with a Wyndham by Request card, we did not receive any goodies such as fruit basket or champagne. I guess booking through discount agents void your Wyndham by Request card. ROOM Our room was in the new building beside the relax pool; the room is adequate with enough storage and closet space. It might be short on space for laying out our three suitcases (one full suitcase of snorkeling equipment). The safe worked and the fridge was stocked daily with three cans of pop and two bottles of water. There were water dispensers in the corridor and almost anywhere around the hotel. The staff kept our room very clean and we usually gave a buck or two for tips daily. They even folded our kids\u2019 PJ and collected all their shoes! The A/C was not loud unless we turned it to max. BEACH I believe the hotel was nearly full but we did not feel crowded in any means, maybe with the exception of the beach. As pointed out by previous travelers, people did put their towels on the palapas early in the morning, most likely before 8am. However, on the first two days we did not have any problems finding palapas after 10am since people started to leave for other activities. The beach was still eroded a fair bit but they were trying to rebuild it everyday with sandbags, there were about 50 to 70 feet of beach in front of the pool. Whether you object to it or not, we did see a fair bit of topless people sunbathing \u2013 sometimes it was an enjoyable sight but sometimes it was not! FOOD We had the buffet for breakfast and lunch almost everyday; the food was your typical buffet style. Fruit was limited to cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, oranges, pineapple and papaya. They did have fresh baked goods every morning. Breakfast had made to order omelets, lunch and dinner had made to order pasta. Very good pasta but a tad heavy on the olive oil - you almost have to spoon it out. Everyday there was something Mexican. The beach restaurant was very convenient and quite good, it served breakfast, lunch and snacks most of the day. The wood oven pizzas were very good as the cook was making the dough fresh. They also supplied the Miramire Restaurant with pizza and pasta. We tried all the a la carte restaurants including the ones in their sister resort (Viva Wyndham Aztec), with the exception of one \u2013 the Bamboo restaurant. Upon arrival they gave us two coupons and we booked all the restaurants at Viva Wyndham Maya ahead of time. Once we used up the coupons, I got up in the morning before 8 to book restaurants at both resorts for the same day. I never had any problems reserving restaurants for the night if I arrived at the service desk by 7:50am. I\u2019ll rank them in the following order: (Portofino) This was by far the best we tried. The fish and steak were very good and don\u2019t miss the flaming Mayan coffee which was performed on your table side. (Maya restaurant - sister resort) Food was good and the presentation was acceptable but not spectacular. However, we really enjoyed the outdoor atmosphere, nice surroundings and Mayan decorations. (La Scala - sister resort) An Italian restaurant with quite good food, except I got food poisoning the last day - it was not an enjoyable flight home! (Hacienda Don Diego) I have only vague memory of this restaurant. (Miramire) An Italian restaurant right above the main pool, it served mostly pizza and pasta. The freshly made pizza was very good - highly recommend the one with raw ham. Again, the surrounding is very nice as you eat facing the ocean. The service at the a la carte restaurants was all good and most of the waiters had a good sense of humor, we usually tipped about 50pesos and the waiters were very appreciative. DRINKS We are not drinkers; we did try the wine, pina colada and mai tai. The drinks were indeed watered down a fair bit in the bars; drinks in the a la carte restaurants seemed to be a bit better. ACTIVITIES We tried the archery, tennis, climbing wall, dance lessons, kayaking, gym, wind surfing and parasailing ($35/person); most of them included instructions and we never found the activities to be crowded. We did go to 5th Ave a couple of times, the shopping was OK with the usual tourist fair. You can save $5 if you take the hotel van to Coco beach (rented by the Wyndham resorts), it runs every hour from 9 to 5. We usually left a buck or two for the drivers. The evening shows were good for an amateur show, the staff did put in a lot of effort (about 3 to 4 hours/day to prepare) during the day. We spent a day at Xel-ha, with the exception of the busy Saturday crowd, it was very enjoyable. The all-inclusive package ($59) was a much better deal than the entry only ($39) ticket, the only problem I could see was the overcrowded restaurant with people waiting in line for the buffet. We took the ADO bus from Playa del Carmen to Xel-ha ($4) and it runs in the morning and late afternoon. All in all, the vacation was very enjoyable, the hotel was what we expected \u2013 not luxurious, clean, safe with friendly staff.", "Date": "April 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greenville, WI", "Title": "\u201cWe didn't want to leave!\u201d", "Author": "jeepfan1981", "ReviewID": "UR7332759", "Content": "This is a wonderful resort! We stayed here for our spring break week: March 31-April 6, 2007. We booked two rooms for our family of 5(two parents, three teens). The grounds are beautiful; gardeners are out daily caring for them. The staff is always saying, \"Hola!\" to everyone passing by. Our room was always spotless with fresh towels, turn-downs with mints at night, and the mini-fridge always daily replenished. I was worried about one of us getting sick, but it never happened. We ate fruit and fish/seafood daily; and my husband even used the hotel tap water at times. I think a past reviewer was correct in thinking that overindulging in the alcoholic drinks might be more of the culprit than the food. As for that, bring your own cooler cups/thermos mugs for them to fill. We vacationed with two other families; however, they chose to stay at the sister resort - Azteca. We ended up going over to use that resort two or three times, never having any problem eating or drinking there. In fact, book parasailing and snorkeling trips with the two Mexican gentlemen down on the beach at the Azteca, you won't be disappointed. We ate at three of the ala-carte restaurants(Miramare, Bambu, and Hacienda Don Diego), all had excellent dinner selections. The lunch and dinner buffet was great, about half of the selections changed each day. Eduardo cooks up great custom dishes in the center island each night. I have read so many negative reviews of this place, and now wonder if we actually stayed at the same resort! We would come back here again. One bit of information I can share that might help: watch closely to fluctuating room rates, especially as you get closer to your check-in date. In the four weeks prior to our arrival, I cancelled and rebooked just the hotel portion of our trip 3 times to get a better deal on our stay(these deals were over and above any cancellation fees I incurred). I ended up rebooking for the last time just 3 days prior with the hotel directly at great rate. I gave them my Wyndham by Request card(I applied free when I originally booked last year) at check-in. We had different color wristbands than most of the people at the Maya; actually, they matched the ones worn by our friends at the Azteca. I don't know if this had any effect, but we never experienced anything remotely rude from any staff person. Another bonus...not one time-share salesperson even said boo to us!

You get the best of both worlds without having to choose where to sit. You are always just a step away from either. I recommend getting up around 8:00 in the morning, going to the pool area and grabbing some chairs. You can get breakfast right by the pool get your chairs for the day and have a nice relaxing start to your day. As some others have said, the wind was more than usual this trip. The last time we went to Playa I remember it being much calmer. Must be why the beaches are having some trouble. The kids had a blast on the boogie boards though! The activities staff was great at this hotel. Don't be afraid to join in on the activities. It will make your stay more fun. My teenagers (14 and 16) loved it as well. There were lots of other kids their age there unlike some other places we have been that seem to have more younger children. The food was the standard AI. Try to get reserations at a couple of the other resturants to break up the monotony. We also ate in town one evening. We took taxi's to town instead of walking because it seems like we were always pretty wiped out so we tried to save our energy. $5 each way for a taxi. There were no drawers in the rooms which made it difficult to keep our clothes organized. I'd recommend bringing only what you know you will need and bring some extra hangers to hang clothes up in the closet. We did not have a refrigerator/bar in our room. Just a bottle of water that we had to keep filling from the water jug in the hallway. This wasn't a problem, just a little inconvenient.

The layout of the resort was perfect, I love resorts that hold about 100o people and are smaller so that you get to know the people around you fro mall over the world. We meet alot of great people and made a bunch of friends for life which was a huge bonus. The food and drinks were great (yes even the wine) at the buffetts and bars. There are 3 resturants on the resorts and they were 5 star. The food was so elegantly plated with the most amazing flavours, it was a huge bonus at this resort. I was a little nervous about the beach because the shape of the beach would pretty much make it or break it for me and it was fine. As you will read there are sandbags that had to be positioned off the beach because this resort is closer to the beach then some on the strip but they didn't bother me.

It doesn't have the umpteen pools of a 5 star hotel, the elaborate marbled lobby, nor as big a buffet selection, but you're getting what you paid for. Being older, the hotel had mature, well kept gardens with some of the thickest palms I've ever seen. A central garden was like a mini jungle through which you could walk, with various plants identified, giant butterflies flittering around, and the occasional lizard or iguana to be seen. The variety of food at the buffet changed daily, with several theme nights. Something for all tastes. Breakfast was fantastic, with fresh, warm cinnamon buns. Didn't try the ala cart restaurants, but heard favourable reviews. Entertainment was pretty good, with some shows better than others, and a couple as good as I've seen at 5 star hotels. The down side was that they were quite late, and sometimes hard to keep the 5 year old up for. Downside for beach worshipers, is that they are working on restoring their beach. They made marvelous progress while we were there gaining back most of what had been previously lost. In the short term however, there are huge sand bags dividing the beach from the ocean. You can suntan as usual on the beach, but just have to climb over the bags to get into the ocean or walk down the beach a little to gain access to the water. Nothing insurmountable. It's not as beautiful as being able to look out directly into the ocean, but understanding their circumstance and what they're trying to restore, it didn't interfere with our enjoyment or activities, and actually provided entertainment for the guests as we watched the engineering in action. Another big plus to this resort is it's location in Playacar, which is the equivalent of a gated community which provides a great sense of security and some added ammenities.

(After all, isn't that why we spent our hard earned money to buy into the timeshare experience?) Well this is not the case with Wyndham/Viva Vacation Club. Being Viva Vacation Club members appears to make absolutely no difference whatsoever. Common sense would indicate that when a resort suffers major damage in a hurricane and the apartment units that used to exist are now gone in the ocean, it would be courteous to let club members know at the time they book their timeshare week at the resort. This way, when they arrive at the resort, they would know what to expect. This was not our experience - we booked our vacation in June '06 and went to Viva Maya in early March '07 to find much had changed from our visit 5 years prior. AFTER we checked in and looked at the map for where our rooms were, we learned that we were being put in a \"new member building\" which turned out to be about as far on the propery from the beach as one could get and still be in the resort! The ocean-front one bedroom apartment (bedroom in one room with adjoining living space including large table, sofa/murphy bed, small kitchennette area, and large patio overlooking the ocean) has now been replaced with two-bedroom units (no kitchennette or living room space at all, just a king bed and small sofa on one side and double beds located in the second room) in the new member building. When we tried to explain the \"old units\" to our representative, he acted as if he didn't believe VM had ever HAD units like this! We were aware there had been hurricane damage to the beach, but were really shocked by how MUCH damage had occurred and again, with no explanation or forewarning by management. Had we known the extent of the damage, we would have chosen another Viva resort elsewhere. I would second those with comments about the front desk staff. Not only were the totally uninterested and appeared bothered by our questions, but I don't believe I saw a one of them smile the entire week. As far as the food goes, it really has gone downhill. The first two times we visited we were not sick. This time I was sick the first day there and had not even left the resort yet. We stuck to bottled water so we are still not sure why 4 out of 6 of us ended up sick at different points during our week in March. We love margaritas but quickly learned that the resort bartenders did NOT know how to make a decent margarita (... in Mexico?) and in fact, the best margaritas we found were at downtown Playa del Carmen restaurants. Salsa was also hard to come by and we never did see any chips. As far as dinner reservations at the \"specialty restaurants,\" we too stood in line (for over an hour) to reserve for dinners, though we later learned from other members if we had gone to the vacation club personnel, they would have made the reservations for us. We were told by the guest services people that Viva Azteka restaurants only accept dining reservations for the same day you want to go there... what they didn't tell us until we tried to actually get a same-day reservation was that Viva Azteka only lets Viva Maya people have 10 spots at each restaurant and you might as well forget it if you are a party of more 4 people - you won't get a reservation. We are Vacation Club Members and we can't even eat at the sister resort like we always used to? That just seemed unbelievable to us. All in all it was a very disappointing week and unfortunately, Viva Maya has lost our interest.

Pictures to follow Beach. Badly battered but was getting better daily. This hotel seems to spending money trying to reclaim beach. The resorts adjacent are not and were losing more beach every day whereas the Viva Maya was gaining beach back through their sand bagging activities. If you want a beautiful flat beach either walk 1 km south to the undeveloped area or go somewhere else. The beach is a renovation zone. That said, the kids were having a blast playing on the sandbags and it was both entertaining and interesting to watch the way the guys were working to get the beach back. Pool and Activities. There are now two pools. One by the beach where all the activities happen \u2013 water polo, water gym etc etc. If you want some quiet time, there is now another pool up at the top of the resort. It has a bar too and is generally for adults although I didn\u2019t see anyone complaining when the kids were well behaved. Activities are the usual AI stuff. Either join in or not, your choice. It seems to have toned down since Wyndham bought in. It was formerly run by Italians and was a lot more boisterous. Sailing/Windsurfing was problematic because of the beach repairs. Also, in the years we have been going, I have never known it to be so consistently windy. In the past, we would have a couple of breezy days followed by a couple of calm ones. It would be a fairly predictable cycle. This year and last, pretty much every day was windy making the water fun for boogie boarding and goofing around in the surf but definitely not your calm Caribbean postcard ocean. So water sports were both beach and weather affected. We sailed probably 8 days out of 13. Hotel Rooms This is not a 5 star resort. It is also getting a bit old (10 plus years) and while they have kept up with the superficial stuff \u2013 painting etc, it is showing its age. However, the rooms are fine unless you were expecting a spa experience. The maid kept our rooms wonderfully clean and supplied with fresh towels, water, pop, coffee etc even before we tipped her at the end of our first week. PS, we tipped 2 USD/day per room. Didn\u2019t need to but they don\u2019t earn much and we do. Storage space is a bit of an issue if you bring a lot of stuff. My daughter emptied her wardrobe into her suitcase and had trouble putting everything away. My son never unpacked. Restaurants/Bars/Entertainment We were there 2 weeks. If we ate at the buffet every evening it would have become repetitive. We booked 5 or 6 \u201ca la carte\u201d restaurants to split up the dinner experience. I enjoyed all 3 Maya restaurants. We had reservations for the Bamboo at Azteca but didn\u2019t make it. Do not expect High Cuisine. This is a budget AI. However, in all the years we have come to Viva Maya and their Dominican sister resorts, we have never been sick. Just follow basic common sense and don\u2019t rush them when they are cooking your meat! The food is above average but not excellent. Again, if you have come for a gourmet experience, you made a mistake. However, if you like trying different foods and enjoy having someone else make it for you\u2026.. you\u2019ll find something to your taste. I always hunt down the hot sauces and spice things up since the food is largely toned down for the North American palate. Pool buffet is mainly chips, salsa, fast food, pizza, burgers etc and lots of fruit. We tipped the waiters in the evening 2USD. Again, not necessary and we weren\u2019t looking for special treatment but it was obviously appreciated. Spend some time in the evening at the bar adjacent to the lobby. Angel is grouchy but makes great cocktails! Benito is still smiling and he\u2019s been there since day one! They have entertainment most nights. Either a sax player playing along to a karaoke machine or a small guitar group. Nice enough but you are not in Vegas! The evening shows are mostly the animation team. They try really hard and our kids love the shows. They brought in some pros for the Sunday shows while we were there. A guy doing the Mayan ribbon thing. Amazing to watch and no safety nets/harnesses! There was the usual Mayan firedance, which is always entertaining when you are sitting in a wooden tent with a thatched roof. There was also a woman doing tremendous tricks with hula-hoops. Obviously, these tricks could only be performed in a bikini. Other than that, it\u2019s the same guys who the kids play polo with and fun. Grounds/Gardens Clearly the grounds are more mature now. The place is 10 years old. However, the grounds just keep getting better and better. I love walking around the place. They have built the resort around the grounds rather than leveling the land and putting up palatial and ridiculous, ostentatious and completely out of place tourist edifices. You\u2019re right. I like smaller resorts! Timeshare sales You will be asked. So be prepared with an answer and stick to it. I should declare that we bought a membership 10 years ago. It has worked for us because we have to go during school holidays when prices are high. We have been lucky. Viva stayed in business. They are now in partnership with Wyndham and we have already had our \u201cvalue\u201d. We come for two weeks during March break and are a family of 4. As far as I can tell, we usually save around $2,500 to $4,000 on our trip depending on the airfares available. Just remember that you will have to make all your vacation arrangements yourself. All you are buying is access to a room and you are dealing with a company in the Dominican Republic. It\u2019s not for the faint hearted. I would not buy at this resort now. It needs renovating and I am constantly fighting with them these days because they put members in the new building furthest away from the beach. The rooms in the new building are better and larger. However, I have a pool at home and come to Mexico for the Ocean \u2013 to look at it, listen to it and play in and around it. My advice would be to say no at this time and wait and see what happens over the next couple of years. Summary The Good 3 \u2013 3.5star, family orientated AI. Smaller than most. Easy to get around and settle into your vacation. Friendly atmosphere, good staff, beautiful grounds, adequate but very clean rooms, decent food and good hygiene standards.

It was pretty much impossible to get reservations at their restaurants for a bigger group of people. We paid high prices for inclusive meals and got stuck eating the buffet all the time. The buffet was good but after several days it is basically the same food at each meal. To get reservations for dinner you had to wait in a long line in the morning for reservations, not very convenient. Overall our stay was pleasant but not very happy with the restaurant situation. We traveled in a group of 11 and it was difficult for our group to dine together. One day I went to get dinner reservations and was in line by 8:15 am and was told that there was nothing left for a group of four. We ended up getting reservations for my family two at 7:30 pm and two at 8:30 pm at the sister resort. We were told that the beach would be repaired by March 1, 2007, but during our stay the beach was in very bad shape and got worst every day. The beach was covered with huge sandbags. While there we observed no attempts to repair the beach other then the cutting up of palm trees that fell during the night. The pool area was fun and relaxing and everyone had a great time doing that. They also had various activities each day. Most of the employees were great. We were told by the APPLE rep at the resort that we could go to the COCO BEACH RESORT and were told that it was another all-inclusive resort. When we arrived after fighting the crowd at the motel to get a shuttle to the resort they dropped us off at the COCO BEACH CLUB which is a section of beach the Viva Wyndham must have rented while their beach is being washed away. As you walked into the water at the BEACH CLUB you walked into water that had debris, seaweed .... floating in it and washing up onto the beach it was not very pleasant. Also there was a little area where you could get hamburgers hotdogs and drinks but it was a far cry from being an all-inclusive resort. There were public restroom that you had to use, no towels available, and NO NON-MOTORIZED WATERSPORTS. (I think they call it the old bait and switch). There is a COCO BEACH RESORT all inclusive but it is a mile or so north of the BEACH CLUB.

We were looking for a fun, relaxing vacation with lots of sun, drinks, and food. We got exactly that. The weather was spectacular. Mid 80's during the day, low 70's at night, though the first night was below normal in the 50's, which made us nervous. To address previous reviews: First, the beach was definitely eroded from the hurricanes. There were many sandbags which made it difficult to walk/jog on the beach. However, they were constantly working on the beach, and there was plenty of soft white sand to lay/sit on for tanning or relaxing, and the water was clear and beautiful. We went on a catamaran, used boogie boards, and even sat on the sandbags, looking out into the ocean for a while. I never felt my beach experience was lacking. Also, there is a nice beach in town, which is very close. Second, the air conditioner is NOT that loud. I like a light fan noise to sleep to, and this was a little louder than a floor fan. No one in our group had a problem with the air conditioner sound. And they cooled the room very well. The bed was slightly on the firm side, but still very comfy. We slept great, and the entire resort, including our room was always clean. Lastly, the staff. No staff member was ever rude to us. We had a couple situations where the language barrier was an issue. Most of the time, there was someone who knew excellent English at the check-in desk....but not always. Here are my own positives and negatives for the resort: Positives: GREAT drinks with fast, pleasant service ALWAYS (and NO we did NOT tip...other than when they delivered our luggage and the housekeeper). Great pool with a swim-up bar; CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN; Plenty to do; Resort is in a great area (all resorts and nice houses/condos); Good spa; Cool, comfortable room, with constantly stocked mini bar; Good restaurants; Close to town (safe 30 min walk or 10 min bike ride); Very friendly staff Negatives: Buffet and Poolside snacks needed more variety and better quality. (Although the cheese pizza was GREAT especially for a late night snack after a few margaritas), the gym is HOT...and I don't mean Paris Hilton \"Hot.\" Much better to walk outside for exercise. Beach chairs: you have to get up early to get chairs UNLESS there is only 2 of you or you aren't laying out until later in the afternoon. My recommendations: Eat the restaurants as much as you can. They have the best food (especially the Italian one). You need to make reservations in the morning (7:30 is when they open I think), but you can make all your reservations for the week at once. Also, try the restaurant that is in town. It's $10 to eat there but it's all you can eat/drink (only certain drinks though). It's nice to get out of the resort to eat. Also, if you WANT to pay for one meal, go to Alux, which is a restaurant in town built in a cave! Very cool environment. Definitely go to town (we went 3 different nights). But STAY AWAY from the guy with MONKEYS. He trys to sell you pictures with his monkeys (only YOU take the picture, and HE gets $40 from you). Even if you aren't taking pictures, don't touch the freaking monkeys. One of my friends let the monkey climb on his head, and the monkey bit his mole off!! He was bleeding all night. So far, no rabies, but still...keep away from the monkeys. All in all, our stay was a blast.

The three main problems people should be aware of are (1) the Viva Maya, and many other beaches in the area are losing its beaches from a change in the ocean currents. There is a very small beach, that's a bit tricky to get down to, but the water is still lovely and the sand that is there, is soft and white. We swam at both the beach and in the pool. The food is pretty much just O.K., Breakfast was the best meal of the day, and if you didn't go right at the start time for lunch and dinner, the food's quality and availability of choice declined rapidly. The only other issue here was the checking in time. Check in time is at 3:00, so if you arrive at 10:00am or earlier during the day, make sure you pack a change of clothes and swim stuff on top or in a carry on, so its easy to get to. Your luggage its put aside, and guarded, then brought to your room when its ready. What makes this resort really nice are the beautiful and well kept grounds (beach excluded), the staff (everyone was as helpful as possible and very polite) and nightly entertainment. The group of performers were great, they even turned my boyfriend into a fan, and he was very skeptical of even watching the shows. Also its nice to be a little removed from playa de carmen, but be close enough for a two minute cab, or even a walk.

I`ve never seen men work so hard!. One thing that impressed me was that a bartender recognized us from 2 years ago!! The room was clean, A/C worked, although a little noisy. The buildings do have some wear and tear on them, but the grounds were very nice! The buffets were good, although with all buffets, it is hard to keep food hot. The restraunts were very good. Probably the nicest touch is that you can walk to the Viva Azteca and use the facilitys and restaurants and Bars and entertainment! A 5 minute walk. Only a couple of small problems, They did not restock our mini bar and it took 2 hours and 2 calls to fix it. We requested a King bed but receives a room with 2 double beds. We had a great Ocean view from our room so I did not want to take a chance on playing room roulette! The people at the pool were all having a great time. Entertainment was very good.

I would like to prevent anyone else from the disappointment we experienced there. First and foremost, there is no longer a beach there. The wind and the waves have taken a huge toll and completely destroyed the beach.....there is no beach left at all. When you walk to where the beach should be, you are met with a view of hundreds of sandbags where they are attempting to save the sand they have left. You cannot get down to the water at all. They are in the process of trying to rebuild the beach, but who knows how long that will take. You'd better check before you go. Another inconvenience was the lack of a dresser or any storage for your clothes. There is only a small closet. You have to live out of your suitcase your entire visit. Being a non-smoker, I found it fairly irritating that all areas of the resort are smoking areas, and there were more smokers than non-smokers. This was a problem everywhere, especially in the dining room. We were among very few guest that weren't from Europe, so there were very few other people that spoke English. The rooms are extremely noisy at night, due the the very loud shows going on every night and their very noisy air conditioners. The food in the dining room is very average. It still amazes me we were in Mexico, but were not able to get any Mexican food unless you made a reservation in one of the other restaurants, which is always booked in advance. I could go on, but I won't. Needless to say, we will never stay there again. The only positive thing I can say is that their activities staff was a really great bunch of young people.

The air condition unit was very very loud and because it was so hot we had to have it on all night. Also the water dispensers in the hallways were often empty. But i am not a humbug just wanted to point this out. Other than this the place was fantastic, the people were so friendly, on our first night in the bar we gave a \u00a35 dollar tip to one of the bar man, although we were all inclusive, this meant that each night we went, before we even reached the bar our drinks were ready for us without having to open our mouths!! The beach was beautiful. We were quite dissapointed with the choice over the buffet food which we had for breakfast, the fruit was sometimes warm and the choice was mainly american sickly and very unhealthy pankcakes etc (not too good when you are suffering from the night before), the italian restaurant we went to one evening (we booked each restaurant in advance at the front reception) was lovely and quite romantic. The pool was lovely and we spent most of the time around there as it was very lively with music and everyone was in a holiday mood. There were mainly american people there and they were extremely friendly and once they heard our british accents they wanted to speak to us all day! Lovely people. We even one night stayed out all night with some american teenagers (about 6 years younger than us!!!) and had a great time.

Be sure to book on the Pirate Attack trip which is an evening trip going from Cancun, it is definitely worth the trip, had such a great time and the island you are taken to is beutiful and is lit up by fairy lights on tree's etc. definitely reccomend you go on this trip more than any other trip.

First of all I\u2019ll start out by saying that you have to bear in mind that this is not a 4 or 5 star resort so adjust your expectations accordingly. Granted, the place maybe needs a little updating, but we really had no complaints except the shower plumbing that clanged horribly in the walls, and intermittently gave us scalding hot water. The beds were hard but we slept well after getting used to it the first night. The AC was noisy, but then aren\u2019t they all!? We actually ran ours all day so it was chilly in the room by bed time then shut it off over night. The room wasn\u2019t overly impressive, but like I said \u2013 it isn\u2019t a 5 star resort, and we didn\u2019t come there to spend time in the room anyway! It was always clean, we had fresh towels when we left them on the floor to let her know we wanted to have them changed, we had a fridge and a safe that worked, and unlike someone else said, we did have a place to hang our clothes and there were shelves to put folded clothing. Nothing fancy but it worked. Check-in, Check-out: We arrived at around 3:30pm and check-in couldn\u2019t have gone better. We were in our room in twenty minutes and they were more than helpful. Checkout went the same way. My husband injured himself while we were there and they couldn\u2019t have been nicer. When I ordered the taxi they even got us a special one with better leg room so he could stretch out. No complaints. I had also seen people checking in at 3:00pm that got the same treatment as we did. There is no early check-in but you are only a 5 min. walk from a small shopping plaza, so you can do that sooner than wait and get upset. They do nothing early so if you know that and plan for it you will be happier. Staff: I am a firm believer that you have to treat people decently in order to get the same in return. We had an absolute blast with all the staff, whether it was at check-in, the bar, activities or whatever. We loved visiting with them, finding out about them, joking with them. We tipped occasionally, not always, and although they were very appreciative, they never appeared to expect it. We had taken our own drink mugs and they got to know the mugs and knew what the drink was before we asked. In fact, my brother-in-law took our mugs up to the bar one day to get them filled for us, and whoever waited on him said knew exactly what went in them. Impressive! We loved visiting with the taxi drivers whenever they understood enough English to visit with us. They gave us good pointers for when we come back and if you ask them about their families or life in general they are more than happy to visit with you. You have to bear in mind that these people work very hard for little pay and put in long hours. They are not second class citizens. I\u2019m sure they work much harder than most of us who are able to spend time at the resort. Beach: The beach is pretty much washed away. There is enough sand at resort level for a couple rows of beach chairs, then you have to go down an embankment to get to the water, and there is about 15 ft. of sand again before you hit the water. But it is nice white soft sand. I didn\u2019t go far into the water, but my husband did complain about concrete chunks out further, that you had to be careful of. You can walk the beach to many of the other resorts (you\u2019ll have to go around or crawl over a number of sandbags) and we found that the further to the south you went the better the beaches were \u2013 less eroded. Pools: The main pool was nice and never really crowded, but cool. The hot tub nearby, was also cool. And when we wanted to use it at night it was drained. Very disappointed in that! There is also a relaxation pool at the very front of the resort, and that was very quiet, if you want to get away from the activities and music. We tried it one day but actually preferred the liveliness of the main pool and the fact that we were by the ocean. Both pools were very clean, but we were told they closed at 8:00 \u2013 again disappointed, however, we heard that that was the case in most of the resorts. Food: OK \u2013 nothing spectacular, but we always found plenty to eat and there seemed to be a variety. We tried each of the ala carte restaurants and found them to be good, not exceptional. We also went to the Azteca (the sister resort, about a 10 minute walk away) a couple of times and found that to be a little better. It was nice for a change of pace. And we enjoyed the walk. Activities: We didn\u2019t take part in any of the activities because we just preferred to be relaxing, but there seemed to be constant activities that a person could take part in \u2013 aerobics, yoga, bingo, Spanish lessons, pool games, Salsa dance lessons, free five minute massages, to name a few. We didn\u2019t stay up to take in many of the evening shows because they ran later than we wanted to stay up, but what we did see was really impressive. The Madona show was awesome. We found this resort area to be very nice. It is kind of a \u201cgated\u201d area and loved the fact that we could go out of the resort and shop across the street, walk to the sister resort (Azteca) after dark for dinner, or walk into Playa Del Carmen (1/2 hour walk) and spend some time. Negatives: The rudeness of many of the guests from certain countries that I won\u2019t mention. (the resort appeared to be about 90% European) I would guess that they are the ones who were rude to begin with, and then complained when they weren\u2019t treated well by the staff. I say this because we always treated the staff with respect and got treated very nicely in return. I know we had many people butt into line in front of us whether it was the food line or at the bar. My husband got sick of it after a while and just spoke up and stood his ground. Please remember it is the small hand full of people that were rude that stand out. I don\u2019t want you to think it is an all inclusive statement, however you do have to bite your tongue a lot. Over-all : The experience was fantastic. We have been to only one other all-inclusive so don\u2019t have a lot to judge by, but would go back to this one again. Remember, you\u2019re not spending $400 a night. Remember it is not a 5 star and make the best of it. If for no other reason it gives you a chance to meet and interact with the Mexican people. They are the best. Bring some ones and show your appreciation and they will show it back. Suggestions: Go para-sailing if you have never done it. Wonderful.

First, they put me in a smoking room when I booked a non-smoking room. There was second-hand smoke coming into my room from the adjacent room. Disgusting! The refrigerator (as-advertised) was not included in my room until they delivered it on day two. There was an ironing board but no iron. There was no shampoo or conditioner provided which is standard for almost any hotel. While I asked my room to be moved to a non-smoking room the morning following my arrival, the hotel was not able to move me until the next day. The second room was indeed a non-smoking room and located in a better area of the resort. However, while there was a refrigerator, it was not stocked with anything until the next day. The safe did not work. The bartenders and waiters were quite good. The maid service was very good. However, I experienced some staff members at the reception and the transportation desks who were discourteous and quite rude. They seemed to have difficulty with providing the most basic service without first telling me no or just simply giving me a hard time. For example, the day before my departure I went to the transportation desk to arrange for a shuttle to the airport. At first, I was informed (in very rude manner) that it would be impossible to get a shuttle to the airport because all of the shuttles were booked and that I should not have waited until the day before my departure to make the arrangements. Are you kidding me?! It turned out that all the shuttles were not booked. On the contrary, I was able to choose my pick-up time and when the shuttle showed up I was the only passenger on board. This type of attitude was very off-putting and does not make me want to ever return to the resort. I am a guest there and should be treated like one. I could not go anywhere on the premises without being constantly exposed to second-hand cigarette smoke. It was impossible to get away from. I know that being from California, I have the rare experience of avoiding cigarette smoke in bars and restaurants and that it is necessary to adjust one's expectations when traveling in other countries. But seriously, this was above and beyond anything that I have ever experienced in my travels!

I find it unexceptable to be solicited for anything while staying at a hotel. The hotel area should be a safe area free from this type of harassment. I also find it rude to be asked how much I paid for my trip etc. The food it ok but is on a one week rotation so if you stay for more than one week you'll be looking to eat elsewhere. I didn't bother booking any of the restaurants as I wasn't prepared to stand in line at 08:00 AM in the morning in order to get a booking. Another problem is the checkout time of 12:00:00 especially if your pickup time is 09:00 PM. You can pay extra for a late checkout of 05:00 pm but the hotel only allows 5 people to do this otherwise paying for an extra day is $350.00 US. I saw quite a few people standing around for 5 hours or more waiting for their pickups. Plumbing and general construction quality is sub-standard in the room I staying in which I was told was in a brand new building. Good points are the cleaning, bartending, fitness facility staff are absolutely excellent. Overall this hotel is about a star and half this year.

The resort is not bad really, but like i said, there's nothing fancy about it. ROOMS: We stayed in a ground-floor room, it was kept clean and we had no problems with the water. They warn you not to drink the tap/shower water, but they do provide Water Coolers outside the rooms to refill your bottles. Our room was just by the gardens overlooking the pool area. There are rooms closer to the beach, but if you appreciate your sleep, i don't recommend them, since the nightly shows can get pretty noisy in front of the Pool/Snack Bar area. RESTAURANTS: We only tried the Mexican Restaurant twice, which was excellent and very nicely decorated. The buffet had a decent selection every day and night, but the snack bar was a disappointment: It looked like they brought mostly cold left-overs: we were hoping for fresh guacamole and salsa, but we got pizza and hot-dogs instead. There is a sister-Hotel 5 minutes north: the Viva Wyndham Azteca, where you can book restaurants as well, or for an extra 10 dollars go the Viva Cafe in Playa del Carmen for an all-inclusive meal. POOL: I guess it was OK, didn't really use it. BEACH: I love the ocean water, and I love relaxing on a nice sandy beach. Disappointed about the fact that most of the beachfront is gone due to the past hurricanes. There is a 2-3 foot gap between the lounge chairs and the palapas and the actual beach, so you'll need to climb down to get to the water (see photo). Some people pull the chairs down the the lower beach level, but it's not a wide strip..maybe about 10-15 feet wide, so it can get kinda tight. I would recommend to take the 15-minute walk down to Playa del Carmen, work up a sweat and go relax at the beach. STAFF: There are a few very knowledgeable directors and supervisors around that speak 4 or 5 languages and will help most guests with any kind of question. I'm not sure if most maids and waiters spoke English, since we speak Spanish and that's what we used to communicate, but I'm sure most guests would get around.

Our original vacation package to Cozumel was cancelled due to terrible snow storms in Denver. We ended up at Viva more as an afterthought in our desperate attempt to actually go on vacation...

A watch out is that most of air-condition units are very loud and will drive you crazy if you need to keep them on. The three a la carte restaurants had good food and are worth checking out. The service in those restaurants was also very good. The nightly shows were ok, but nothing to write home about. I must say that the New Year's Eve Gala and Las Vegas show were very good and the staff went out of their way. There is a nice coffee bar setup in one of the bars on the property for the morning crowd, that makes good cappuccinos and lattes, unfortunately no one tells you about it, and we found out about it after almost a week on the property. The workout / sauna area was very nice and the equipment was well maintained. The areas that needed improvement: I don't believe that this hotel is setup for American clients. I could count on one hand the number of American families that were present at this hotel during our stay. As such, it was very difficult to communicate with anyone at this hotel. Very few people spoke English and the emphasis was more on Italian, French and Spanish languages. I was overwhelmed by the number of smokers that were at this resort. For a non-smoker, it was difficult to enjoy this vacation, because we were surrounded by cigarettes. I think I brought back two packs of Marlboro Lights in my lungs. The beach was completely washed out by Wilma, so it was small and very crammed. This hotel has only one pool and with limited beach space, it became crowded very quickly. We witnessed people fight over lounge chairs. When you combine that with scuba lessons and water aerobics, the pool was unaccessible for some part of the day. The process to reserve a space in the a la carte restaurants was very frustrating. It took over an hour of standing in line to learn that the restaurants were booked for four days straight. It was a good thing that we stayed for more than a week; otherwise we would have not been able to enjoy them. The buffet restaurant was ok, but the food got old very quickly. The entire stay we wondered what happened to the good parts of a watermelon and cantaloupes, because only the \"end parts\" with the white rim were served. The snack bar on the beach served hot dogs, hamburgers and pasta. I often thought \"I don't come on vacation to Mexico to eat hot dogs, I don't even eat hot dogs at home\".... A more local selection of foods would have been much better. Good luck trying to find a manager, I don't think they exist at this hotel. I asked to speak to a manager on three different occassions and were told that they are not available. No one every followed up on my requests. All in all - I don't think that I will be returning to this resort any time soon.

Tennis courts were a bit hard to reserve but not impossible by any means. The resort even has 2 'clinics' a day - one for beginners and the other for the more advanced.

Food is not great but it sure is open most of the day and night. The Bad. Beach! The beach is pretty much washed away. There is a 3 foot drop from where the beach chairs are to the water. Plus the beach is extremely shallow in depth. Just enough room to squeeze in 3-4 rows of chairs and that is it. Forget playing frisbee on the beach of having any room at all around the beach chairs. Also as the resort is small everything is somewhat crammed together. In some respects this was nice as everything was close but the beach area was so close to the pool and all the activities that it was pretty noisy. Talk of noise. There are so many jet skis and parasail boats cruising around that it is far from peaceful. If you take a kayak out on a nice day you will have a constant buzz of jet skis flying by you. Every resort has its ups and downs. We have been to a number of Iberostars and Rius throughout the world and I was wondering how a lower class resort would stack up. Overall I give it a thumbs up as I wouldn't say that their service or food was lacking much at all. It is unfortunate though that there beach has 'temporarily' vanished.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "verona", "Title": "\u201cperfect\u201d", "Author": "sissixx", "ReviewID": "UR6561494", "Content": "My family and me loved Viva Maya.

(rating more like 3 and a half, not 4) There are goods and bads, but mostly goods. It is an all-inclusive, tip if you want for exceptional service. 4 restaurants and a snack bar, food was good \u2013 better in the ala carte\u2019s. Reservation line for the ala carte rest\u2019s was from zero to ten minutes. October 2005 hurricane stripped the beach, and they have not replenished, lost about 50-60 feet of beach. Both pools were quite clean and we were there over Christmas so they were heavily used. Rooms we had were nice, clean, and quiet. Staff was VERY friendly. Check in was painless. Mix of US Canadian and European, probably in that sequence. Lots of smokers. Entertainment was nightly and terrific! No lacking in things to do. Shops right across the street. Three meals per day at a buffet restaurant, huge open windows so almost open air. Food was good, almost always a fish, beef and chicken. 4 or 5 fresh fruits with breakfast where there was a made to order omelet grill. By the main pool is a 24 hour snack bar. The Miramare restaurant is roofed but open, better quality food, res. Req\u2019d. Porofino is enclosed and AC as is the Mex. Restaurant. reservations also. Did not do the Mexican since there was Mexican food at every buffet meal. Portofino was excellent! As mentioned, if you like long walks on the beach, forget it. Steep drop off almost right into the water. But the water was GREAT. Free use of catamarans, peddle boats and kayaks \u2013 very nice and pretty well kept. Beach chairs \u2013 about \u00bc had pads, but most resorts have none so that\u2019s a bargain. Christmas week you had to get out and put towels out by 7;30 to get good spots. The \u201crelax pool\u201d was quite nice, no kids \u2013 very quick bar service. The staff was great and very friendly \u2013 of course it helps if you, the guest are friendly too. I suspect they react in kind! The staff does shows every night and some were quite good \u2013 lip-synched. It is a very large outdoor but covered theater \u2013 including a Disney show, Madonna, Michael Jackson (great) Grease (even better), and others. Shows were very well attended! They also had structured exercise classes in and out of the pool. We had two sea view rooms \u2013 a gripe here \u2013 some rooms had dressers with drawers, ours did not \u2013 we had shelves. A bit inconvenient, but no big deal. They had bottled water in the room, and a small refrigerator. They have large bottled water dispensers in the hallways, so you can always have bottled water if you choose, though the water seemed safe. It is a large property, probably a quarter mile from beach to road. Out at the entrance you can borrow a bike to ride around the area. You should go into town, long walk, but only $5 US for a taxi. Quite a variety of shopping on \u201c5th avenue\u201d or just go across the street, probably about 20 stores there. With the nix of Continents represented, you will find a lot of smoking. In the buffet rest. Smokers are separated, and in the ala carte\u2019s they seemed to keep the smokers and non smokers apart, though it was informal. So if you like to smoke, this is a good place, if you don\u2019t, you will sometimes run into some issues. By the way, most folks seemed to plan to go back there, that says something. Other stuff \u2013 tennis (rooftop) archery, horseshoes, a pretty good kids club. We have had the good fortune to be in Cancun (this was out first in Playa Del Carmen) a few times and a number of Caribbean islands, in different quality resorts, so we havea reasonable ability to compare.

This resort is rated as a 3 star, but is a 2 star at best. Everything is just a 'little broken', i.e., looks good at first but when you examine closer something is wrong. This includes balcony doors flooding the floor when it rains, showers that turn burning hot and icy cold alternately continuously throughout the shower, chairs that are saggy and a little broken, hot food metal bins with no handles (ouch), etc, etc. The food is not up to par at any of the restaurants or buffet. They use cheaper cuts of meat and haven't heard of marinating so everything is extremely tough, and use low quality ingredients in thier food, i.e., hot dog weiners instead of sausages at breakfast (no bacon was ever seen), and no salad dressing was available though lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. were available for a salad. We finally figured out that these were condiments for the hamburgers which were always in evidence, along with the french fries and pizza. There was plentiful fruit - but again, it was cut up probably the night before and not entirely fresh. If you liked pizza you could eat happily here for 3 meals a day, but everything else was a 'poor man's buffet' with poor quality food and no taste or imagination put into anything prepared. They provided hot sauce on the side for those that like it, but put no effort whatsoever into putting flavor into the food itself. The service in the specialty restaurants was very bad - if you asked for anything that was not on the menu they wouldn't even consider it, (even it you asked if an ingredient could be left out due to an alergy) and we actually had a waiter at the Portofino restaurant angrily tell us off when we asked for a Mayan Coffee with \"We are very busy tonight [they were about 1/3 full] and don't have any time for that stuff\" which was hissed into our faces. I was actually shocked by this treatment. This was the attitude at all of the specialty restaurants until they were serving desert in which case they were all smiles, etc., hoping for a tip. We have always been tippers at All Inclusive resorts, and were surprised to see no one tipping at this resort but after a couple of days we stopped tipping as well as the service didn't support it and if you did tip they didn't remember you the next time and gave you the same attitude. We felt there was very poor management at this resort which was evidenced by the attitude of the service people (though the desk people were excellent), very low grade food, and nothing works properly. This would be an average 2 star resort, but in no way qualifies for the 3 star rating it has been given. The price was reasonable but I have experienced what I would consider 3.5 star treatment cheaper than this at a 3 star resort. We were expecting a 3 star level and were very disappointed. Combine that with the attitude of the service people and we would not recommend this resort unless you know that it is lesser grade.", "Date": "December 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cViva Wyndham Maya, Travel Agent Point of View\u201d", "Author": "etravelgent", "ReviewID": "UR6174070", "Content": "Let me start by stating that I am a travel agent so I look at things with more scutiny as I try to put myself in my customers \"sandals\" if you will, each time I travel weather it be for business or pleasure. My husband and I arrived on Sunday, 11/12 after a charter flight from Boston which provided us with just a snack so we were hungry. Check in was nothing eventful, we got our hotel cards and went to our room. Our room was quite basic with no dresser for our clothes but did have a cubby as you walked in to store your clothing. An average bathroom with shower that would clamk loudly each time we turned on the shower until it got up to speed. We found it humerous that the hotel did not provide soap in its bathrooms but provided a sign that stated if you forgot your toothbrush, toothpaste or razor they could supply these itmems for you upon request......but the most expected item, soap was never mentioned, so remember to take some along with you. We proceeded to the snack area by the pool where they had a grill area which provided burgers, fries, pizza etc.... throughout the day and evening. The burgers were flat and were not the best quality meat but they did suffice. We walked the property and noticed cats, small fat beaver looking animals and an overall acceptable grounds for this class hotel. The pool was cloudy, I never enter cloudy water, just not worth the possible problems that might result, ladies, you know what I mean. The beach was crowded and the water was pretty, although we usually hang out by the pool area. We ate at the buffet that night which was poorly run, the food was just not what we were accustomed to, there was a line of ants which formed a moving line on the wall behing one of the beverage stations. This made us decide to check out the Viva Azteca which we intended to do, the very next day. The Viva Azteca is about a 15 minute walk down the safe street. We arrived and noted that it was definitely a star above the Maya property. The common areas as you entered were much better laid out, the buffet was much cleaner and had a better selection, the lobby area bar was far superior than the Maya and had much more confortable padded chairs. The pool was not cloudy and we liked the pool layout better, although it does not have a swim up bar like the Maya, we don't usually drink in the pool anyway. We decided that we would spend our days here, go back to the Maya to change then walk back to the Azteca for dinner. we ended up doing this every day we were there. It was a nice walk which we enjoyed doing. We did try the formal restaraunts, they were all pretty average, our best formal meal was in the Mexican at the Maya. The evening we went to La Scala, the italian restaurant at the Azteca My husband was a bit taken back when his chicken parm arrived at our table as a flat breaded cutlet with sauce and sported a bone protruding from its center. All in all, it was a decent trip, we did spend a day at Secrets Capri where I was able to get a day pass to. I had to drag my husband kicking and screaming back to the Maya but promised him we would return to Secrets with my sister and brother in law in the near future, Secrets was a very nice hotel but a very different class of hotel also, one which I knew the Maya was not. I know who I would send to this hotel and who I would not. But all in all, if you end up at the Viva Maya, make sure to go to the Viva Azteca, you might find that you will spend most of your time there. joan@bernardinitravel.com", "Date": "November 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Trip Don't hesitate with the Wyndham\u201d", "Author": "liveforvac113", "ReviewID": "UR6138488", "Content": "Just returned from the wyndham yesterday,went with a group of 18 and had a great time.If you r looking for a five star hotel the maya is not for you.

There were plenty of sun loungers to relax on or you could take part in the fun and games organised by the staff - we did yoga, step aerobics, water polo, salsa, football. There was plenty of watersports to enjoy as well - kayaks, katermerang, windsurfing (all at no extra cost).

I had booked this hotel as a last minute deal, and after reading reviews, I was starting to wonder if I'd made a mistake! However, as soon as we arrived I realised it was a good choice. The check in staff were really friendly, their English is not that good, but much better than my Spanish, so it would be rude to complain about that. The porter was very helpful, didn't expect a tip, and seemed very gracious to receive one. We had one of the rooms furthest away from the beach, and the veiw wasn't good, although I booked last minute, so it was to be expected. The room was spacious and clean, the aircon was very loud, but a great friend as the weather was soooo hot outside. The room was cleaned every day, and fresh towels left when requested. Not following the advice on here... we didn't leave the cleaners a tip until the last night, but they always left us fresh water, and did a very good job. The staff at the hotel work extremely hard, and the grounds are beautifully maintained. We found all the staff to be very friendly, and they always greeted us with a \"hola!\". The buffet resturaunt has a good selection of food, although I would agree with a few peaple when they say, it all feels a bit \"samey\" after a few visits. I would reccommend the fresh pasta dishes, where you choose your own ingredients, and the chef cooks it all up for you... very tasty (he also does a great omelate for breakfast too!). The food in the Italian resturaunt above the pool bar is nice, and the veiw as the sun sets makes it the perfect place for an evening meal. The best food at the hotel we found was in Portofinos, this was a beautful room with great service. The Mexican restraunt was ok, but me being a vegetarian there was nothing on the menu, and when I asked if there was anything they could do, they said \"of course\".... then brought me a plate of carrots, peppers and onions.... no sauce... just veg! This was a shame, as my Partner's meal looked wonderful. A few tips: : The reservation desk opens at 8 for the restraunts, get there before then as the que is long, and we missed out on our choices a couple of times. : If you want a lounger by the pool or sea, go down before 8am and put a towel on your lounger. Although at first I felt quite rude doing this, we kept missing out and found ourselves with nowhere to sit. : The jacuzzi behind the gym is just lovely and a great place to escape to in mid-afternoon when the sun gets so hot. You have to book sometimes, but it was always so quiet when we were there, and most of the time it was just the two of us. : The drinks in the main bar by the reception are a lot nicer than the pool bar drinks (they seemed to taste salty... we thought it was the sea air). All in all, we had an absolutely wonderful time, we got engaged while we were there, and are going back to Playacar next year for our anniversary. Although we are staying at a another hotel, just for something different. I would (and have to many friends and family) reccommend Viva Wyndham Maya, and hope to stay there again some day.

Snorkelling outside in the beach - not a lot to see, however if you walk left (north) past the Azteca beack to where there is some limestone rocks on the beach then the snorkelling is quite good with lots of fish and quite a few inquisitive cuttlefish - no corals though but it was close to the shore. One of the good things about staying at Playacar is that its halfway between areas such as Coba (a must see) and Xel Ha, and Cancun. This is good as a lot of trips/excursions leave from Cancun.

Normally we always book the Iberostar, but that was booked, so we took our changes with the Maya Hotel. In all honesty it was a major disappointment. We stayed there from September 16 till 23rd. Check in; We were helped quickly, the room was very small and to find our room was a challenge since the room number (1374) does not appear at the signs in front of the apartment blocks. Since there was no bell boy available we were searching the scene ourselves. Our Room; Was very small, I missed the guest soaps and all that nice stuff. There is no minibar. There is no room service. They do no provide water bottles in your room The air conditioning was as if a cement mixer was placed in the room so if you would go to sleep you had to turn it off. You can not sit at your balcony, since the hot air of the neighbors airco is blowing on your balcony. The noise/music of the shows during the evening was extremely loud, even with your air conditioner on and with the TV on loud, you could here the music of the show. Our room had a door in between and the people next to us were smokers and their smoke was coming into our room, in fact in the morning it was what woke us up the smell of the cigarette smoke. The shower was in my view very dangerous, the cold knob was working when it felt too I guess, so when you took a shower some times boiling hot water was spraying on you. It you have a child and if it will use that shower, I seriously think it could have 2nd degrees burns Of course we asked for another room and the so called manager John said he would let the shower fixed and that we would get another room the next day. Needless to say both requests were never done. Because we were only there for 7 days we left it at that. The beach is beautiful, there were only 6 palapas however, but you can ask for an extra parasol. There are way to many beds on the beach, so if you want to move around you bed a bid, you have to drag a couple of beds to a another row. There is no beach bar, but a pool bar, which is not near the beach. The drinks were tasteless, you notice that when you go to Playa because suddenly you realise \" hee that Margarita actually taste very nice!\" This is for us the first time we ate and drink very limited at an all in hotel because it was all lousy. When you were walking to the pool bar you always had to walk very carefully, because the floor was always slippery. The people at the pool bar were helping very slow, and again their cocktails are lousy. The shower at the beach was missing a lot of tiles and I saw a lot off people falling at the shower area. Overall the maintenance at the hotel is very poor, the tiles at the beach shower, lights at the staircases were broken. The staircases were very dirty. All the furniture (hotel lounge, rooms, restaurants) in the hotel is old and should be replaced years ago. The food was very limited. The restaurant was chaos every night, the plates are placed at the corners of the buffet, so everybody was walking across each other, bumping up at each other looking for a plate or a cup which were at a different corner every day!. The service at the restaurant was also poor, coffee in the morning? yeah if you were willing to wait 30 minutes. Something to drink at night during diner? yeah, if you are willing to signal all evening to a waiter. What was funny to see to most was when we were checking out. A late check out was denied by the so called manager John, because he was expecting a lot of new guests. We were leaving a 17.00 so if you have to wait from 12 on, it is long. When we were killing time me and my husband were counting the time this so called manager John was smiling to a customer, and he did that 3 times in 3 hours and to a colleague. When the bus arrived hotel staff were actually checking if you turned in your hotel bracelet and were denying you to get in the bus if you did not return it. As you can use in a another hotel!!! There were so rude to the guests it stunned me. I think if you do not know better, this hotel may met with your standards, but if you have experienced other hotels like Iberostar this hotel is for sure not the one for you\u2026..

The hotel is clean, rooms comfortable, food is plentiful, varied and of good quality and the activities offered are excellent and cater to all tastes. We arrived looking for an opportunity to relax but also keep active and have fun and found everything we needed at the Maya and overall it was incredibly good value for money!! We paid $120 dollars a night for the room for 2 people booking online through the Wyndham website for a standard room which I thought was a pretty good deal for all inclusive (also particularly good value for us in the UK with the current exchange rate). I joined Wyndham by request having read the other reviews and we were upgraded to an ocean view room right at the front of the property overlooking the pool and the beach. The room was immaculately clean and well stocked with towels, toiletries etc. We also had a decent sized fridge which was stocked and refilled every day with beers, sodas and water (we had a beer on our balcony each evening before dinner and new beers arrived each day). On arrival we also received a bottle of merlot and cheese and crackers which was a nice touch. It is well worth joining the programme to get these extras and will only take you 10 minutes on the hotel website - if you've already booked just email the hotel to add your number to the booking. Drawbacks on accomodation were that the room furnishings were a little dated and the air con was a little noisy but these were really minor things given how little time we spent in the room anyway. Food overall was plentiful, varied and of good quality. There are 2 a la carte restaurants (Mexican and Italian) and a pizzeria in addition to the buffet at the Maya and a further 3 a la carte restaurants (Mayan, Italian and Japanese) at the Viva Azteca which is only 10 minutes walk away. We ate at every one of these at least once and only ate at the buffet 2 nights in 14. You do only receive a limited number of tickets for advance booking of these restaurants but all of them can be booked on the day without a ticket. Be prepared to stand in line for 10-15 minutes at 8am when guest services opens and you can eat wherever you like \u2013 Elena on guest services is especially helpful! We particularly enjoyed the pizzeria which is partially open air looking over the pool and ocean and the Portofino restaurant at the Maya. You need to set your expectations appropriately for the level of hotel you are staying in and what you are paying and on this basis it was excellent. Also if you are eating at the buffet go early when the food is hotter, fresher and the Italians are still at the beach and not pushing to the front of the queue \u2013 this is annoying but you just need to stand your ground and remember it\u2019s a cultural difference not a deliberate attempt to upset! Lunch consists of burgers, pasta and pizza by the pool or if you want a quieter lunch with more choice head up to the main buffet (deserted at lunchtimes) where the pasta station is very good. For variety go and have a couple of dinners locally in Playa del Carmen on 5th Avenue but I wouldn\u2019t advise paying the extra $10 for the Viva restaurant in town \u2013 the food is the same as in the hotel and it\u2019s not a brilliant location or ambience to justify the extra spend. Evenings after dinner we tended to have drinks in the main bar and there is a lovely piazza to lounge in and watch the fashion parade of the young predominantly European clientele. The caiparinha is excellent, they have brand name alchohol rather than local brands and you get glass glasses here rather than plastic so it\u2019s a little more sophisticated than the pool bar. They also often have music in the evenings \u2013 not a rowdy affair just someone with a guitar \u2013 all very chilled out. The beach in Playacar is gorgeous, white sand and turquoise sea but if you want to enjoy it at the Maya you\u2019ll need to get up early and find a lounger before they are all snapped up. Also if you are looking for relaxation try to find a lounger towards the front of the sand next to the ocean and away from the pool games, dancing lessons and music (fun for those who enjoy them but if not you can get away by being further away on the beach). Also there is a \u201crelax pool\u201d towards the back of the property with no music but a lovely little bar that does smoothies and drinks and this always had loungers when we were there. Activities at the Maya were plentiful we enjoyed archery, snorkeling, windsurfing and tennis \u2013 most activities also offer some free lessons. I went to the group tennis lessons offered daily at 9am around 7 of the days we were there and other than on 2 days (where I was with 2 others) it was a 121 private lesson with one of the tennis pros which was fantastic. We also dived with the onsite dive operation who were good but groups were a little large and we probably could have had a cheaper deal in town if we\u2019d bothered to check that out. Qualified divers should definitely do the Cozumel and Cenotes (underground cavers/fresh water) dive trips as these were both out of this world! The hotel also has bikes that you can borrow to ride into Playa del Carmen (10-15 minutes) and we used these a couple of times to check out the town. The hotel also has a good gym which my boyfriend used and enjoyed while I had a lovely spa treatment. The spa is very quiet and you can use a Jacuzzi and steam room in there at no cost so worth a look if it is a rainy afternoon. We found all of the staff (other than curiously the rather stand offish check in person - not the best of starts) to be excellent they are really motivated and kind and very responsive if you speak in Spanish to them \u2013 a hola and gracias will go a long way \u2013 you by no means have to be fluent but they appreciate your efforts. All in all we found the Wyndham to be excellent value (where else can you pay $60 a day and get a comfortable ocean front bedroom to sleep in, 3 decent meals, an a la carte dinner with wine, cocktails, private tennis lessons and a gorgeous beach location??) and offer something for everyone \u2013 we thoroughly enjoyed our holiday \u2013 just don\u2019t expect 5 stars ambience when you are not paying a 5 star price.", "Date": "September 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milano", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel with some lacks!\u201d", "Author": "viagginelmondo", "ReviewID": "UR5766132", "Content": "We just had a 1 weeks stay at the Wyndham Viva Maya resort. It's a nice hotel with many facilities and it's in good shape. The food is good - nothing special but tasteful and a big variety. It's one of the \"all-inclusice-places\" above avareage but I did not fee too comfortable as there were 3 mayor lacks: - it must be a \"Yucatan speciality\" that all staff does not greet. We had the same some time ago at 2 other resorts just North of Playa del Carmen. No \"Good morning\", no \"hi\", \"hello\", \"hola\" nobody greets and that's a real shame. We've been to so many resorts, clubs and hotels and as a guest you usually enjoy a friendly sometimes smiley face that greets you and you feel among friends. But at the Wyndham Viva Maya everybody looks serious and walk their way without even watching you - while we staid theer we never got a coffe/the or wine/water from the waiters unless we stood up and went to the service stations to ask for it. There are guests (and I suppose that they gave tips to the waiters) who get the best service: waiters always standing around their table, chatting and always filling the glasses/cups. But we weer not part of this special service and always had to stand up and ask for it. - last but not least we hated to see all those smokers in the theater during the shows. Our kids were always covered with smoke from cigarettes and even staff members sat down next to us and started to smoke and to protect the kids we always had to stand up and change seats. It's good to see that teh Wyndham Viva Maya cares about nature and ask guests not to use straws or keep towels more than just one day. But why do they use packed margarine, jelley, sugar and cereals? Their try of protect nature seems ridiculous with all this stuff! Anyway: The relationship of what you get and what you pay is very OK and maybe I'm a little bit picky if I want somebody to greet me, or have my coffee and wine for the meals served without being forced to stand up.

Check in at the hotel was both quick & friendly. (the \"welcome \"cocktail was really welcomed.!). and the little Spanish we know was really appreciated! The staff at the hotel were the best I have ever come across..Allways a smile & a \"hola\" and nothing was too much trouble. Although we did leave a tip for the lady who cleaned our rooms and for the \"chaps\" behind the bars..we did this because we wanted to not because we had to. The hotel grounds are impeccable, with signs denoting what species of flora are around. Keep an eye out for the 3 legged cat...he/she is a sweetie, along with the ghekkos (great for eating the mosquitos) iguanas, and a really cute animal which looks like a cross between a rabbit (with out the ears) and a hedgehog (without the spines)...!!. Plus the birds..Even at the some of the top hotels in Europe..I have never seen some much wild life..did I mention the Pelicans and if you snorkel around the sand bags.. the fish! (take a sausage from the pool side breakfast buffet and feed them...) Booking this hotel as part of a \"package \" through a travel agent ..would compare to a 4* European holiday package. Indepentantly it is a very good 3*. The food overall was good. The Portifino is excellent compared to the other resteraunts on site. The Viva Cafe...don't bother...although the food is good, the place has poor air con and the service not worth the extra money. Lunch at the pool is a bit of a free for all...but that is mainly due to the clientel!. Evening entertainment is what you want to make of it...yes some of the shows are \"cheesey\"...but some are very good...if you don't like it go to one of the other bars! Really would recommend Xcela...we went on an all inclusive package...don't rush for breakfast at the hotel...you can get it there...missed out on lunch as we were to busy in the lagoons, lazy river etc..we still didn't get to do everything! Swam with the manatees, sealions & dolphins...brilliant.

However what both myself, my husband and my 2 teenage children had the experience of ,was rudeness to the extreme shown to the staff of the hotel and fellow guests...it seamed as though \"please \" (por favor) & \"thankyou\" (gracias) was totally missing from their vocab, as was the ability to queue!.

Everything else was consistently mediocre. We knew going into this trip that it wasn't a five star resort, and I do think that the price, for what we got, was reasonable. The food was average at best. We were so sick of the buffet by the end of the week, and the a la carte restaurants weren't much better. Plus, if you weren't able to book in advance (you only get a certain number of dinners you can book in advance) the only times left were 6:30pm, which was a little earlier than we wanted to eat. The service was also average at best. There were a few stand out people; bartender Luis, bellman Jesus, but, overall, the service was not great. This was even with taking advice from other reviews and tipping the bartenders, wait staff, housekeepers, etc. It didn't seem to make any difference at all. The entertainment was cheesy, and the activities staff people were abrasive and annoying. The majority of the guests were European, who, for the most part, were self absorbed and rude. There were a lot of kids, who also for the most part were very poorly behaved. The room was fine, but our AC was finicky, the cable didn't work when we got there, which we were luckily able to fix by ourselves. Overall, we made the best of it, and enjoyed ourselves regardless of the downfalls. We rented a Jeep and drove to Tulum, then spent the afternoon at Xel Ha. Snorkeling down the river there was great. One note - we got pulled over driving back from Tulum. The officer was awful. He tried to tell us that we had been going 89 km, when the speed reader had said 79 as we passed. (speed limit was 80) We tried to cooperate at first, but he was going to take my boyfriend's license, and we'd have to go to the police station and pay $100 to get it back. The officer spoke very little English, and with my limited Spanish, we weren't able to communicate very well. We argued that we weren't going as fast as he said, and after about 20 minutes of arguing, he finally let us go. We're sure he wanted us to bribe him, but we weren't going to do that. I was able to tell him in Spanish that I thought he was attacking us because we were tourists, and that we had paid a lot of money to travel to his country. His response was - you didn't pay me.

Never had a problem with the bed being hard or the air conditioning being loud, never had a problem with finding a chair at the beach but If you need a beach umbrella good luck with that people check them out and take them back to their rooms for the whole time they are there. one day i watched a man take 3 back to his room. that really needs to be fixed.

It is only a 10 minute walk or $5 cab ride to Playa del Carmen where many bargains are to be found. However, we will never go to the Cancun area again because of the Cancun airport! We have travelled extensively and have never encountered such a chaotic airport as Cancun. We deplaned to find ourselves in line with literally over 1000 people trying to get through a painfully slow immigrations process. Once that was finally done (over 1 hour) we then had to try to navigate around hundreds of people to get our bags to then get in yet another line for Customs wherein they xrayed every bag! The couple in front of us (after a 45 minute wait) had a wrapped package with them about which the customs agent questioned them for at least 10 minutes before allowing them to go free. It is then a 55 minute ride to the Viva. We left home in Washington D.C. at 6 a.m. and did not get to the hotel until 6 p.m.! We could have travelled to Europe for that amount of time. The return was no better; the airline computer system was down, so we waited over an hour to check in only to be told that a piece of paper given to us when we entered now needed to be presented to leave! No one had told us this and we are not ignorant travelers. So, we then had to go back to immigration and fill out new forms and go back to get our boarding passes.

On the third day of our vacation they came up with some excuse that someone else was given our minibar and beverages by mistake and that they did not have any left. On the fourth day they left an ice bucket with 4sodas and 2 no name beers, which they never replenished with ice or beverages. I completely put all blame on the Byrequest associate, he is completely incompetant, and is in no hurry to help fulfill their empty promises. Well, enough about him! The rooms were kept clean, however unless you bribe the maid with a couple of dollars daily, you won't get enough towels. We had 4 people in our room and only 2 towels. She would never consistantly leave 4 towels two days in a row, it was only done when we left money, than miracuously 4 towels would appear. Be sure to bring toiletries such as soap, shampoo, conditioner, as these are not always provided. (again only provided when tip was left). We were in Mexico!!! Money talks!!! The buffet food was o.k., but repetitive. The a la carte restaurants were a little better, but not great. All in all we were a little dissappointed with the food and variety of food. I definitely recommend the Viva Cafe downtown, associated with the resort, for $10 per person. This was the best meal of the week! The service was outstanding, they couldn't do enough for us. It was very nice. The nightly entertainment got better as the week went on. The performers work very hard all day, and than perform a show every evening. My hat is off to them and all that they do! The best part of this resort is the beach, which is why we didn't mind the 3 star resort. When we went the first time we realized that all of the resorts are on the same stretch of beach. We spent most of the day by the beach anyway, so why pay for a 5 star when you really don't spend much time in the room. It's all about the beach! Playacar is our favorite beach and for that we will return again and again. I would not stay at this resort again, but there are plenty of choices along the beach. In closing one last note. This resort was mostly Europeon guests. (non-english speaking) By the end of the week we were sick and tired of being cut in line at the bar, and at the omelet and pasta stations at the buffet. Finally, I told one lady that she was very rude to cut in front of us and she looked at me like I had 3 heads. This was a horrible display of manners!!", "Date": "July 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cLousy Food\u201d", "Author": "islek", "ReviewID": "UR5499452", "Content": "Great Staff but Lousy Food.

I e-mailed the hotel to inform them of our anniversary and requested building three, the newest at the resort and also requested dinner reservations at Hacienda Don Diego and Portofino. Check-in was very quick and although we were a few hours early we were given our room number and bracelets to enable us to eat lunch. We were given two coupons for dinners at the reservations restaurants and made both reservations the following day. ROOM Our room was as requested, a king room in Building 3 with a jacuzzi tub and separate shower, robes and slippers. We received a bottle of complimentary wine with cheese and crackers. The refrigerator was stocked upon arrival with Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola light, Fanta Orange, Sprite, water and 2 bottles of Sam Adams. Each day thereafter the refrigerator was stocked with whatever we requested by placing a note in the fridge daily (and sometimes a tip). On our first evening, when the fridge was restocked, we also received a complimentary bottle of champagne. Each evening, turn down service was provided. Bed was huge and comfortable\u2013 no concrete slab for the mattress, we actually had a mattress/box spring set and slept very well. Storage -plenty of storage, both in the room and the very large closet. Our balcony overlooked the new Relax Pool. Bathroom, with two sinks, was stocked daily with whatever essentials we needed, but I had brought most based on prior reviews. They do participate in the Green Globe program (conservation program), so if you want fresh towels just place your used towels on the floor and they will be replaced with clean towels daily. The room was a very short walk to the lobby and only a few minutes from the beach. THE LOCATION Approximately 2 kilometers from Playa's Fifth Avenue or a 20-minute walk. Only a few minutes with taxi and the cost is only five dollars. FOOD/DRINKS La Terraza Buffet was on the 2nd floor above lobby area and where we ate most meals (not air-conditioned). Always a large variety of food and we could always find something that we liked. Breakfast (6:30am-11am) There were omelette/eggs cooked to order available every morning, cereal, yogurts, fresh banana smoothies (excellent), breads, rolls, french toast, pancakes, bacon, sausages, juices, chocolate milk, & fresh fruit. Lunch (12:30pm to 3pm) Buffet had a mexican section, desserts, varied hot foods daily, breads, pre-made sandwiches, chips/guacamole/salsa. Very good and usually not crowded in the afternoon. Dinner (6:30pm-10pm) Buffet was at times crowded and hot in the evenings so the reservations only locations were a nice break from this atmosphere a few times throughout the week. Dinner at the buffet always provided a good variety of foods with a section of Mexican, made to order pastas, and another section, which varied daily. Desserts were limited but that aspect did not bother us. Beer and wine were also available. Snack Bar (Pool area) Breakfast (8am to 10 am) Was more limited, but did include omelettes/eggs cooked to order breads, cereals, coffee and fruit. Lunch (11am to 6pm) The same items daily with a different pasta and mexican dish. Regular items included wood fired pizza (excellent), hot dogs, burgers, fries, chips, salsa, fresh fruit and ice cream. Late Night Snacks (after the show nightly about 10:30 pm) Included hot dogs and other pre-made sandwiches. Hacienda Don Diego \u2013 (Reservations necessary) Nice atmosphere, good food, but very poor service for us. I did notice however that other wait staff provided much better service. Strawberry margarita welcome drink was very good! Portofino- (Reservations necessary) Food was excellent, as was the service! I had the mahi-mahi, while my husband had a pork dish. Seafood salad was very good as well. Don\u2019t forget to have the flaming Mexican or Mayan coffee (great presentation tableside). Miramare We did not eat at this restaurant, but did see the food being prepared at the snack bar. Stombolis, pizzas and pastas looked very good. La Cantina Lobby Bar Opened daily at 8 am and had good espresso, cappuccino and lattes. Best place for drinks later in the day. Also had a set-up around 4:00 p.m. and Manuel would make very good Mexican or Mayan coffee every day. Pool Bar Opened at 11:00 daily and at times was busy during the afternoon and tips seemed to help with service. Bartenders do remember you and prepare your drinks as soon as they see you in line. Relax Pool/Relax Bar This pool was a very nice break from the activities pool and so much more peaceful with lots of umbrellas also. The bar at the new Relax Pool had one of the best bartenders in the whole resort. He was very attentive and many times we did not even have to leave our lounges and he was cheerfully delivering drinks for everyone. Drinking Water: Water was never an issue and it was always available in containers/coolers throughout the resort. It is all purified. It was in every hallway in our building, in the gym, at the pool bar, etc. Don\u2019t forget, they do participate in the conservation program so they want you to refill the water bottles that they provided in your fridge. Theme Nights Friday\u2019s Mexican night was excellent and something that you do not want to miss. There are vendors set up in the courtyard at 6pm, a show at the theater, and another show in the courtyard afterwards. There is a Mariachi band also in the courtyard. It was a fun evening! Various Nationalities For those from the United States, you probably will be a minority at this resort as we were. It certainly helps to practice and use your Spanish. We love the various nationalities and languages so this was not a big issue for us, although at times my husband had a problem with very rude people (and they were not ugly Americans). THE BOTTOM LINE Viva Wyndham Maya is right on the beach, offers a good location near Playa del Carmen, is an exceptional value for the price paid, and has a friendly and helpful staff.

Our original reservation was for the Wyndham Azteca, but upon arrival we found out they were over booked for the first night. They said we could go over to the Maya; if we liked it we could stay or return back to the Azteca the following day. They sent for a cab and off to the Maya we went. We were put into an upgraded room (whirlpool tub, separate shower), very nice and worked out a couple massages for our trouble and decided to stay. We found out that we weren't the only ones who encountered the same problem, but it all worked out in the end. Me, wife and kids (9 and 6) all had a great time. There was plenty to do, or not...your choice. The kids club staff was excellent and they arranged a birthday party for my daughter on one day (pinarta, cake). Set up and cleaned up afterward. The food was average to very good, depending on the day. We ate at all the a la carte restaurants (three), the buffett, and pool snack bar . Some of the meals at the buffett were better than the a la carte's and visa versa. The only meals we didn't eat at the resort were when we went on the Captain Hook dinner cruise, and lunch on a day trip to Tulum and some cenotes. The overall staff was excellent, the grounds were kept clean and it seemed as the whole operation was working around the clock. Every night there was a show put on by the staff, except on Friday night (Mexican fiesta night) where there was Mexican and Mayan dancing. I must admit though, toward the end, the all-inclusive thing grew old, but for the cost, it was well worth the price. We met up with a family who was staying at the Azteca and they came over to the Maya every day. They told us that the Azteca didn't have as much to offer the kids for activities...probably a better alternative for a couple. I highly recommend the Maya for familes: plenty of activities for the kids, two pools, short walk to the beach (even if you are at the last building), and plenty of food choices (my kids are pretty picky).", "Date": "July 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chilliwack, BC Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Service\u201d", "Author": "Lexis85", "ReviewID": "UR5367296", "Content": "Me and my mom stayed at the Viva Maya for a week.

I don't remember his name but he was the bartender by the quiet pool...I think it was Raquel, was very gracious and he always had a smile on his face which made the stay ten times more awesome. One more person that I want to mention, his name was Jorge and he is a waiter in the cafeteria (upstairs....not the one by the pool) he was very polite and me and my mom always looked forward to dealing with him. The shows at night in the theater were very cool, we never missed a show.....except for the Madonna one where the power went out for a few hours. My mom got upset about that because power was out in all the rooms so we had no choice but to go to bed since we were not interested in the parties that happen every night.

Location:The hotel is in the most beautiful part of Playa del Carmen, called Playacar. The down town is about a 30 min. walk, but as the weather is pretty hot, I would suggest go by bike (free rental at the hotel) or take a taxi (5 USD called by the hotel or stop on the street). The houses at the area of the hotel are in a wonderful botanical garden. Room: We were nice to the guy at the reception - if you know what I mean - and we had a pretty big room looking at the adult pool, equiped with jaccuzzi. The bed was perfect, not too soft, not too hard. The daly cleaning was correct. When we arrived the minibar was empty we found only a bottle of clear water in our room. We didn't care too much of it as we don't drink Coke, Sprite and similar stuff. Clear water was in a big tank at the corridor for refill your bottle. Later they fill up the minibar 2 times with Coke, Fanta and beers. This building has two levels and tennis courts on the roof. There is no elevator. The restaurants are in 3 minutes walk, the beach is in 6 minutes walk. Please note, that the rooms with ocean looking are next to the main pool and the stage were are evening shows on every evening from 9:45 to 23:00. Food: You can eat from 0-24. The food in the main restaurant is allways fresh and tasty, but not extremely varied. The soft drinks and beer is self service but the water and vines is served by the waiters which is not a good idea because sometimes you should wait too much. The snack bar next to the main pool and the beach is a good option for breakfast, lunch and daily snacks. They offer very delicious hamburger, hot dog, pizza, pasta and fresh salads/fruits. For the dinner you can eat in 5 restaurants (2 at in the Viva Azteca 5 min. walk) for free or in Viva Cafe at the down town for 10 USD pp. We loved Viva Cafe and Bambu restaurant at Azteca. Drinks: there are three bars, two by the pools, one next to the reception. The bartenders are friendly, the drinks are OK. There is live music by the reception bar at every evening. Staff: the all staff is very frendly and helpful. Animators are great, there is some fun in all day. At the evening they perform shows, the Grease was really professional. Beach: the beach was probably the most beautiful at the area. There are enough sunbed, but if you need an umbrella (and you need!) you should weake up at 7AM one time, go to the beach, take one and don't give back before your leave. Guests: lot of Italians and Americans, some French, German (and rarely some Hungarian :o) To sum up: We are sure there are more elegant hotels with probably better food, but we would go back to Viva Maya becuse of the friendly environment.", "Date": "June 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, TN", "Title": "\u201cNice place, scenery worth the trip\u201d", "Author": "Memphisvb", "ReviewID": "UR5328821", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from our delayed honeymoon trip to Play Del Carmen. We have some friends that are members and got us a good deal for the rooms. I must say if you know someone who is a member see if they can hook you up with something. For the price we paid the experience was great! If it had been the regular full price I think we still would have enjoyed our stay but would be a lot pickier. I read a lot of the reviews before our trip and the comments were accurate. Here are some things to help you out if you decide to visit Playa Del Carmen and Viva Maya. 1. Riviera Bus- the best advice I got from tripadvisor was to take the bus from Cancun to Playa. It was super cheap and easy. You can check out Playa.info and I think there is a link to the bus information. 2. Food- not good. Basically average \"bar' food. Nothing to rave about. We didn't even like the a la carte restaurants. Word to the wise, you won't eat well, but enough to sustain. 3. Staff-very friendly and helpful. 4. Room- basic but about right for the price 5. Guests- if you can go in May before the big high school graduation rush, that is better. We arrived May 31st and it was perfect, not too crowed or loud kids. But by the time we left on June 6th it was a little too crowded and again the high school drunk kids is annoying. 6. Excusions- go to guest services and book something with All-Tours Native. We did the Coba Maya Experience and had a blast. It is worth the money. 7. All inclusive benefits- non motorized sports. If you take advantage of the free snorkel gear, catamaran, kayaking, windsuring, scuba lessons, etc. i t realy makes the value of your trip go up. 8. Playa- quickly growing. It will probably mesh into Cancun in the next 5-10 years. The town is great to walk around and lively at night. But word to the wise, if you are looking for a cheap meal on 5th Ave. you won't find one. Get off the beaten path. There are some nice little places where you can get a non touristy meail. 9. Scenery- absolutely beautiful! Great beach. Crystal clear warm water. The pool is nice too, but can get crowded, so my husband and I spent most of our time in the ocean. 10. Must do- excursion, lots of sunscreen, catamaran, early morning swim in the ocean, at least one night in Playa. 11. Booking your trip- check for website deals like on expedia. Also, if you find a deal at Viva Azteca check that out too. It is quieter, newer, better grounds, and looked like a nice chill environment. Really the Viva Maya is a nice place to stay, especially if you can get a nice deal for your rooms. to think that it is next door to the RIU which is probably double the price and they both have the same beach! who cares really if your room is just a tad bit nicer?", "Date": "June 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sterling Hts, MI", "Title": "\u201cBetter than Expected\u201d", "Author": "b1j2m3c1", "ReviewID": "UR5327817", "Content": "This was our first time at an all-inclusive although we've been on a number of cruises. Wasn't real sure how we'd feel about staying in one place. It turned out much better than we expected and it was was nice being able to concentrate on the area for a few days as opposed to a few hours. All in all I'd do an all-inclusive again although I still like the cruise concept too. With that said I'll start on the Viva Wyndham Maya. Front desk check-in can be confusing. There are some rude people who cut in front of you. The desk has certain people who perform certain functions so you'd better hope your in the line for the right person. It could easily be solved with a single line between the cords system but I don't see that on the horizon as this sounds like an ongoing problem based on previous reviews. Hotel itself is very nice. Appeared very clean and the staff was very helpfull. Rooms were cleaned daily. While previous reviews have complained of hard mattresses, I found them comfortable (and I have a bad back). The rooms aren't luxurious but we didn't spend a whole lot of time in it anyways. They are clean, comfortable, and no bugs. The small patio with two chairs was wonderful to sit on in the morning, admire the view and have a cup of coffee. Be warned, there are no elevators! We left some money for the maids each day even though it isn't required. The restaurants were OK. We didn't encounter the running out of food problem at the buffetts but it could have been a little warmer. We ate at the on site Mexican restaurant and it was good. I ordered beef and later found that Mexico is known for tougher beef (my mistake). The others in our party said the food was excellent. We also ate at the Japanese restaurant at the Azteca and really enjoyed that also. WARNING- We thought you could eat in the sit-down restaurant every night. We were there for five nights and six days which entitled us to ONE dinner reservation in a sit-down restaurant (otherwise it's the buffett). We weren't aware of this until we were checking in. You can get in line at 8:00 a.m. to see if a reservation is open but that can be kind of a hassle. Beach was phenomenal. It appeared that the further north you got, the more erosion there was. Our beach was very good with no sandbags. It looked like there were plenty of beach chairs as we would get out mid-morning and could always find two together. This hotel draws a lot of Europeans (75%?). Occasionally, English is a problem with the staff and other guests, but we were able to work around it just fine. We were there during Easter Break and there weren't a lot of kids and rowdyness. It seems the \"Breakers\" stay in Cancun. Playa del Carmen is a wonderull town. It has changed dramatically since we were there five years ago. We felt very safe and the people are very friendly. The main street for entertainment is 5th Ave. Tons of bars, restaraunts and shops.

But I have to say this hotel is better than what I expected. Firstly- you should bear in mind that this is a 3 star hotel. If you have stayed in a 5 star hotek you will notice the differences- mainly in the rooms. Rooms are comfortable, well presented but basic. The first day of my stay I had to report to reception that my bath tub did not drain properly- this was fixed very quickly. Second when you do have a shower the hot water can go slightly colder, but only slightly and is not a major worry. The maid does not give freshly washed towels every day, they just really fold them up nice and neatly. We were also left with less towels at the end of the week than what we had at the start of the week. This was a dissapointment but one I belive can be fix with a $1 tip and a note. I would suggest you bring your own towels, shampoo and shower gel. What they have is basic and has proberly been there sometime. This is the only main difference between a 3 and a 5 star hotel i.e. room facilities aren't great. I didnt spend much time in the room, so this will not affect your holiday at all (unless you want to spend your holiday in an air conditioned room watching tv and washing your hair all day). Secondly- the hotel is absolutley fantastic for kids, teens who want activites- every day they had some sort of games/things to do and prizes (free t-shirt/medal) if you took part in a game and did well. Also wound 9 - 9.45 PM everyday they put on a little sing-a-long for the kids to get up on stage (in the threatre) and and have fun and present prizes- I thought this was excellent. after 9.45 in the theatre is a daily show which the hotel reps (who have spent all day with hosting activites) perform- entertaing stuff!

We were delighted with the quaintness of the gated area in which the resorts are located, and the opulent (by Mexico standards) homes that lined the red-brick streets. CHECK-IN: As stated by many others here, I can attest to the patience-testing practices of their check-in policies. We too were told we had to wait until 3pm to check in, even though we arrived at around noon. After a while we saw people arriving who were receiving room keys immediately. We tried to find out why, but the desk staff wasn't conversational enough in English to understand our query. They were all very friendly and polite, but chaotic. At that time of day it is extremely hot up at the open-air front desk, and we were getting hot and tired. I showed the nice little man a $20 bill and suddenly he was in a flurry of back and forth, disappearing into the \"back office\" for several moments and then returning, working busily to get us our room, Once he had us all set, my friend also pulled out a $20, and that $40 we gave him almost sent him to the floor - he was overcome. ROOMS: The room was basically a room. It had a very small desk that was completely taken up with the TV and a tray with an ice bucket (I'll get to that shortly) and coffeemaker. Again, as stated by many others, the A/C units are very loud, but we spent almost no time in the rooms so we didn't care. Our bathroom appeared to be newly tiled in that nice big marbelized tile - very pretty, and immaculately clean! They did have some curious habits regarding bathroom amenities, but I will discuss that in that section. Many have also said this: beware of concrete beds. We thought they must be speaking metaphorically, but au contariare! The matresses are, in fact, placed on concrete slabs built into the floor. They were unbelievably HARD! We actually got used to them after a couple of nights though. We had a wonderful ocean view and Cozumel-view room way down in the very front by the beach looking out over the resort next door. I'm pretty sure we weren't supposed to have that room (we paid for a standard garden view) so I think our guy fixed us up pretty well. AMENITIES: People didn't really mention this in many reviews I read so let me say this up front: Prepare to not have ice available for your room. They do not yet have purified water so they cannot make ice. They truck it in for the bars and restaurants by the truckloads. Also, you cannot use the sink water to brush your teeth. They give you bottled water, which they started out being rather stingey with. There are also water jugs in the hallways where you can refill the water bottles. Often times the hallway water was empty, but when we called, they were replenished quickly. Our room had a fridge, but nothing in it. We asked for sodas and booze and were told we were not entitled to those things. However we had planned for this contingency and so we took a pre-written note thanking the maids for taking good care of us and and also some trinkets to leave with a small tip each day requesting soda and extra water. By day 2 we had Coke, Sprite, extra water and extra coffee. You do them right and they will do you right!! They seem to not expect tips, but they remember you well if you do! They had the usual assortment of toiletries in the bathroom (shampoo, lotion), but if you used any of it, they did not replace it. Kind of strange. Maybe you had to ask?? Be prepared to climb steps. There are no elevators. Good exercise! RESORT AND GROUNDS IN GENERAL: Very lush and lovely with canopied walkways up near the front that were very tropical feeling. The had an expansive open air lounge up front and a bar off to the side that was covered. At night they had a great local guitarist who, along with his synthesizer, played the greatest music in the evening, On some evenings they had activity in this open lounge area, like jewelry sales, finger painters etc. The stage for the nightly shows was down near the beach and pool, and this was the main activity area. There were meandering pathways on both the right and left leading down to the beach area. Very pretty. The grounds were immaculate AT ALL TIMES. The workers were visibly diligent about keeping the place sparkling clean - even outdoors! POOL AND STAGE area: The stage area was quite large and seated a lot of people. You could also sit back at the pool bar area and watch the shows. The pool and bar area were lovely and there were ample tables and chairs for afternoon siesta from the sun and the beach. The tables and ashtrays were kept clean, clean, clean. You could eat breakfast and lunch down there and then after a short closure at 6, they re-opened at around 9 or 10 and served snacks all night. The pool chairs appeared to be at a premium, but I like the beach so it didn't bother me, There we always beach chairs, even with the resort full. They have umbrellas that you have to sign out. If you don't get one by 8 am, you probably won't get one. Once they got another supply of umbrellas in at around 9, but that was the only day we saw that. I don't know if they do or do not intend to re-build all the palapas that used to be on the beach. ENTERTAINMENT: They had sailboards, catamarans, kayaks and such available for free. They had a staff who would take you out for an hour to show you how to work the boats. This staff was more international. We met a Dutch boy, and young man from Argentina and another from Montreal. They were very friendly and would sometimes ask to join you at your table at lunchtime around the pool bar. These people were very overworked! After they put in a full day of sailing and conducting games and activities and teaching couples to rumba and so on, they are also required to put on the shows at night. The shows are fairly elaborate with lots of costumes and LOTS of dance steps they have to learn. The shows are not the greatest, but they are entertaining, and these kids try very hard to please and put on the best show they know how to put on. They did Moulin Rouge one night, Cinderella another (yes some of the young guys had to dress up like the mice and lip-sync to the squealing mouse voices from the cartoon soundtrack). It was cute. They also did a Stars night, where they lip-synced and danced to Celine Dion, Christina Aguilara and other famous singers. Another night was Madonna night. I don't know how many gigs they've got, but we figured at least 10, if not 2 weeks worth of different shows. The shows last from about 9;45pm til 10:45pm. They come around all day asking if you are going to come to the show. BARS AND RESTAURANTS: We ate at the buffet and the beach bar all except one night when we went to Portofino. I had the stuffed chicken dish - it was very good. Otherwise, breakfast was good, with great scrambled eggs, or you could get omelets, fried or whatever if you requested from the grill. Breakfast seemed to be quite American in it's flavor with eggs, french toast with syrup, pancakes, sausage, bacon ..... I don't know, maybe breakfast foods are universal. There was always a lot of fruit out, but it never changed - watermelon, honeydew melon, grapefruit wedges and orange wedges. Every once in a while some mango would find its way in there. There was always lettuce and tomotes for making salads. In the buffet restaurant up front we had the same wait staff every night. We tipped and so they REMEMBERED us and so we got special treatment. Because we tipped, they awaited us not far from the food lines with trays to carry our plates to our table. They would have 2 glasses each of ice for our water to be poured over because they remembered that's what we got for ourselves on the first night. And then they would fetch my friend's coffee, because they remembered she had that too. They don't get paid all that much, and very few at this resort are tipping!! Even $1 US dollar is appreciated! Food was plentiful, and contrary to some reviews, it never came even remotely close to running out, as some reviewers said. Drinks were as strong as you wanted, and if you tipped a buck, they would have your \"usual\" waiting for you before you could get all the way up to the bar (if they saw you coming anyway). If you tipped them a $5 just once, they would start serving you top-shelf booze. My friend tipped $5 at the bar up by the lobby one night for a gin and tonic, and after that drink, she got Beefeater and tonic in abundance the rest of the time, and with great attention paid to having another ready for her before she finished the previous drink. STAFF: All staff were friendly, courteous and eager to please. They all smiled, in spite of their very long hours, and they made you feel it was a pleasure to be there to serve you in all ways. THE BEACH: Gorgeous. What else is there to say? The water was a turquoise and teal vision as far as you could see. The water was crystal clear on some days, and a little opaque on others. They say ever since Wilma it has been stirred up in never-before-seen ways at times. The last 3 days were very high surf and all water activites were stopped (parasail, jet ski, snorkel trips sailboats et al). It was fun in the big waves though! There is a spa booth on the beach to the right and you can get every kind of massage conceivable there. I had a 50 minute deep tissue massage. It was heaven! There were parasailing, snorkeling and dive boat excursions located right next to our beach, so if you wanted to do any of those activities you didn't have to seek them out. We always found a beach chair, and we preferred to sit to the far right, by the spa booth, out of the fray of the others, as it gets a little sandwiched in in the middle of the beach. The last thing I will say and is seldom mentioned - and maybe most don't care - but be prepared at this resort for very few Americans. This resort is 90% European, and most of them French, I will say it: the French were a problem. They didn't do anything per se, but they were unbelieveably arrogant, rude and unfriendly. We experienced them staring at us A LOT, and that got very old after a while. We were cut off in food lines by them and shoulder bumped as we passed by on walkways or stairways. They never tipped any staff. They were unapologetic. GET OUT OF THE WAY, they seemed to say. This is why we moved to the periphery on the beach. Problem mostly solved! Just wanted you to be prepared! Overall, this place is truly a little piece of paradise and we had a very nice time!", "Date": "May 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jamestown, NC", "Title": "\u201cGreat vacation, sort of\u201d", "Author": "SandyC1969", "ReviewID": "UR5067748", "Content": "We just returned on 5/12 from a seven day vacation at the Viva Maya. There were five adults in our group, three \"superior\" rooms booked. We were warmly greeted upon arrival and escorted to our \"superior\" room. Rooms - the Viva Maya is a smallish, older resort with two long buildings in a \"V\" shape, with the top of the V at the ocean, and the main pool and activity area in the bottom of the V. The Maya has built a new building which is behind the V, behind the lobby, behind the spa/gym . behind the restaurants, etc. In other words, it's a huge trek to get to the beach, pool, or anywhere near where the action is. The rooms in this building are new, still under construction, so you have workers going up and down the halls, hammering, noise all day long (not that we planned to spend any time in our rooms). The tile flooring still had grout dust all over it that had not been thoroughly washed down. Our \"view\" from our sliding glass door consisted of a 6' wide strip of dirt with a tall chain link fence. No coffee maker, refrigerator that did not work, gritty floors and no view. This is NOT what we came for. After many trips to the front desk and conversations with the clerks on duty, we finally were able to speak directly with the manager, Gerardo. 24 hours after our arrival we were moved to \"standard\" rooms (this is the room pictured on the Maya website). He insisted that before he moved us we had to see one of these rooms because they were smaller, did not have central air but wall mounted units, and did not have jacuzzi bathtubs. We advised Gerardo, politely, that the \"superior\" rooms did not have jacuzzi bathtubs either. The standard rooms are in buildings 1 and 2 (the two buildings making up the \"V\". Each room had a gorgeous view of the ocean with the palms swaying in the breeze, or pool/ocean views. They were clean, and comfortable. Yes, the beds were hard, yes the mattresses are on top of a concrete base, but we slept like babies. If you don't like sleeping on hard mattresses, go somewhere else. We did have coffee makers and working refrigerators, but the Maya does not stock your refrigerator. You are given one large bottle of water daily, which we chilled down in our fridge. If you wanted more water, there were water spots in each hallway where you could re-fill your empties. When booking, make sure you ask for a \"standard\" room in either building 1 or 2 - do not accept a room in building 3 unless you want a long, hot hike to get anywhere, and absolutely no view. Food - The buffet breakfast was great. Wonderful fresh (and I mean fresh) egg omelets, bacon to die for. The fruits were fresh, coffee nice and strong. We mainly ate lunch at the pool side snack bar where they had grilled hamburgers, hot dogs, french fries, nachos, fruits, spanish rice and beans, etc. For dinner, there are three reservation restaurants on site, plus the buffet, plus more restaurants at the sister hotel, the Azteca (which is an easy walk). We ate at the buffet the first night, then hit the reservation restaurants all other nights. Every restaurant had wonderful menus with delicious food. We were not disappointed with any of them. Special mention here to Antonio, the head waiter at Don Pablo's (Mexican) restaurant, who went above and beyond to help us celebrate a 60th birthday for one of our party. Staff - With the exception of the front desk clerks, and one lady at the guest services deck, we found the staff to be friendly, very helpful, and fun. Jose' and Hector at the pool bar were exceptionally nice, and treated us like royalty. Guadalupe, our maid, was very sweet, Jesus (who showed us pictures of his beautiful wife and three children) was wonderful in helping five older folks tote their luggage from room to room. Spa - Wonderful! There are hot tubs, cold tubs, steam and sauna rooms available at no charge to guests. Two of our group treated ourselves to a body wrap/massage, which was very relaxing. Recommend visiting while there. All in all, the first 24 hours were not what we would call pleasant. Once in our standard rooms, the vacation picked up and we enjoyed the rest of the week very much. The price is very competitive, but keep in mind, this is a 3 star resort. If you are used to 5 stars, pick another place. We have stayed at a 5 star in Cancun, with much better amenities, but the Maya is smaller, and much more intimate. So, in our mind, it was kind of a traide off. But, for the money, we were comfortable, well fed, treated great, and had a wonderful vacation.", "Date": "May 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jersey City, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cSun and Stars\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5044475", "Content": "My brother, his friend and I stayed at Maya for a week.

First off, front desk needs some serious attention. We had been up since 2:30am and arrived at the actual hotel at around 10:30am to be told no room until 3pm. We knew this ahead of time and didn't create any problems. We thought we'd check back at around 1:30 to see if it had opened up, he told us it didn't and told us what room number we'd have when it did open up. Out of curiosity we checked where the room was an saw that the maid was cleaning it. So, we figured it would be ready fairly soon and told front desk we saw the maid in there so it must be ready, still they denied us and even at 3pm we had to wait around until close to 4 to get in. The hotel in general could be a little more understanding as far as check in goes, people come from all over the world and arrive at different times, and especially when they were up in the middle of the night there could be a little more understanding. Some of the front desk staff were helpful and did answer some of our questions. As far as the grounds and the hotel cleanliness, there was absolutely no complaints at all. We could see maintenance people watering the lawn, gardening, and cleaning throughout the trip. Also, behind the bar they had hand sanitizer and the room was always cleaned. The trick is, if you want a cleaner room or more towels leave a $1 bill sitting out with a note and we got extra towles and extra water. Maids were never rude and always pleasant and helped you out if you needed something. The $1 helps because they work hard probably for a fairly minimal wage. One of my biggest concerns was the stories about people getting sick so I was a bit nervous arriving in Mexico. The rules are quite simple, don't drink tap water or eat in places that your gut urges you to stay away from. We didn't eat out of the resort for our meals and hallways had filtered water. I drank mixed drinks which involved ice and had no problems. We were told on the bus that ice comes from filtered water, whether this was factual or not, i never got sick. The food was fairly consistent and you could expect the same thing every night and morning from the buffet with a few changes. This can get a little bit boring so we made reservations at Miramare and Portofino. Portofino was definitely better the Miramare. Miramare has very small portions (Ravioli was anyways) and wasn't that impressive, still good but nothing to write home about. Portofino was better and the food was good. You could get snacks like hotdogs, pizza, salad, and a few other things near the pool at pretty much all hours of the day and night which did the job if you were hungry outside of buffet or restaurant hours. The hotel had some really cool features like a modern sitting area near check in, giant chess, vendors that came in, shows put on by the entertainment staff that were actually good, they'd host the \"Disco\" on the beach or in the outdoor seating area to add some variety, nice gym with what looked like new equipment, and a quite \"private\" pool located near the entrance of the pool where there aren't many children if at all. They also rented out bikes that would save you from having to take a taxi and get you some exercise as well. Just keep your head up while riding these things and make sure you get a bike with a good tight chain on it so it doesn't come off like mine did. Plus, with taking a bike out you can see the cool houses in the neighborhood (the resorts in the area and homes are in somewhat of a gated community). Drinks always varied from strong to medium, and the odd weak one. They appreciate tips and can get you served faster as well. The rooms were great. The tv wasn't exactly top of the line but you don't fly to a new place to sit and watch t.v. the whole time. The AC can get loud, so if you prefer you can just open your door to the balcony and leave the screen door across to let some air in. While we were there at night there was always a breeze. Bathroom was nice but beware of the changing water temperature, can go from hot to cold in seconds. The main pool are was a nice area, it did get a little busy at times which lead us to go the private pool to get away from all the noise. The beach was a bit crowded but the sea was a lot of fun, We walked down the beach and rented a jet ski ($50 US for 1/2 hour) and had a lot of fun there as well. Over all, really cool trip. We saw Tulum, Playa Del Carmen (downtown), and Xel-Ha. The hotel was overall really nice and you won't be disappointed, just be patient and don't let small things bother you.

Check in: Very slow so you will need to be patient. Disorganized people didn't know where to stand to check in lines everywhere. Room: ok. Beds were hard. Although I'm not on vacation for the room, so is was ok. It would have been nice to have a more detailed description in the room of what was offered at the resort, etc... Pool and Beach: Were good. The beach was crowded so if you wanted a chair you need to get out there early. Kid Activities: I did not bring my kids with me this trip, however it seems liked the kids in the Kid Program were having a great time and had lots of activites to do. Food: It was ok, nothing to brag about. There was only one place to have breakfast and lunch, unless you left the property. Someone had mentioned to us that the Bamboo at the Azteca was great. We never got a chance to go because the reservations fill up fast and it apparently was a small restaurant. I recommend making your A La Catre reservations right away and first thing in the morning because they fill up fast. Food at the pool area wasn't bad. Pizza was actually pretty good. Drinks: Were weak, although when we asked for more alchohol it was no problem. Excursion Desk: Paul was very helpful. He showed us a safe and inexpensive way to get to places, otherwise the taxi got to be pretty pricey. Guest Services: This was my biggest pet peeve. Talk about the worst service ever and always misinformed. You would think that this desk would be the friendliest, it was by far the worst. We asked them about visitng another hotel and asked how far it was and one gal suggested that we could walk to it, but it might be best to take a taxi the first time. Thank God we took the taxi because it was at least 20 miles away one-way! We needed to make a local call and guest services said it cost $50.00! My sister clarified in Spanish $50.00(American)and she said yes. hmm I don't think that's correct. I know phone calls can be pricey but whoa! We had called 5 times to have our mini-bar restocked.

I did not include my email address because it is a work e-mail and I suspect my employer would not appreciate it. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our stay at the Viva Wyndham Maya. I had read all the reviews on this web site prior to our stay and did not know exactly what to expect prior to our arrival. Our stay was from Monday April 17, 2006 and departed April 24, 2006. This will be somewhat of a long review but I found these reviews to be very helpful and I feel some of the tips I received from other reviews really enhanced our stay and therefore I feel compelled to return the favor. Let me preference this review by stating my wife and I are not the \"Hoity Toity\" type and if you are don't go to this resort. Also the resort guests seemed to be about 50% Italian, 25%German, and 25 % a mix of people from the U.S. and Canada so if you can't handle this type of break down don't go to this resort. But if you are the type of people who enjoy a beautiful setting, very nice staff, a festive environment, interacting with people of different cultures, and all for an absolute bargain, this is the resort for you!!!! We booked our trip through Expedia travel. I had read in some reviews if you book your trip through a travel agency rather than directly through Wyndaham resorts you\u2019re treated somewhat as a second hand guest but we did not find this to be the case at all. I telephoned Expedia a few days before our trip and confirmed our reservation was in place prior to our arrival. I had arranged through [---------------------]for transportation to and from the Cancun airport. It was a personal transfer so there were not any stops at other hotels along the way. It cost $110 U.S. dollars, which was about $20, more than some of the other transfer companies I found on the Internet but they all stopped at various hotels along the way to drop of other customers. I felt the extra $20 was worth avoiding that hassle. A person from the company is waiting at the airport with a sign with your name on it. The transportation was a newer model vehicle that was air-conditioned and they offered complementary water, beer, or soda. I am not sure, but a taxi might have been a little less money and they are readily available both at the airport and hotel. When returning to the airport to go back home figure you need to be at the airport at least two hours in advance. Also Mexican time seems to run a little slow they were about 15 minutes late picking us up which caused a little stress for a couple minuets. Now for the Hotel review: Rooms: The rooms while not extravagant were more than adequate. We received a ocean view room which in our opinion was in a perfect location which faced the ocean and pool area and was located in the middle of the resort about half way between the lobby where the court yard, main bar, and buffet is located and the pool bar, snack bar, and beach &pool is located. The air conditioner was a little noisy but no big deal and it worked well, which was vital considering it, was quit hot, particularly during the day and early evening. The shower/tube always had hot water and good water pressure. The tub did not look inviting to sit in, and the tub leaked a small steady stream but again no big deal to us. The room had a small safe, that you programmed in your own combination, which we considered to be a big plus. Our room also had a small refrigerator, which was nice. Our maid was very nice, did a good job of cleaning our room, and kept it well stocked with soap, shampoo, toilet paper, and restocking our small refrigerator with water each day. Because of several of the reviews that indicated they received no toiletries we brought and used our own, and as a precautionary measure I advice bringing your own toiletries. There was a bottled water bottle dispenser located in each hallway where at any time you could fill your water bottle, so remember to always keep your empty water bottle until at least the next day when you should receive another bottle. By keeping the empty water bottle if for whatever reason you don\u2019t receive a new bottle the next day it won\u2019t be that big of deal. (There is also cold water available at the beach bar.) Because of reading prior reviews we tipped our maid two or three dollars each day, which she always seemed grateful to receive. I am not sure if the tipping made a huge difference but we were very happy with her service and felt she deserved the tip no matter if it was the reason for improving our service or not. The room also had an Iron and Ironing broad, which seemed nice but we never used it. Even through we were grateful we received the room because the location was perfect, we felt even if we had a garden room, which gives you a view of the neighboring resort and a partial ocean view it wouldn\u2019t have been terrible because in all reality you spend very little time in the room any way. There are no drawers to store your clothing in but there is a closet with a limited # of hangers. (Advice to bring extra plastic hanger in your suitcase.) Opps almost forgot because I have thinning hair, but there was also a hair dryer in our bathroom. The Television worked well even though there was a minimal amount of English speaking stations there were a few such as the cartoon station which could be important if you have children, and CNN which I appreciated because I like keeping up to date with current events. Food: Like I mentioned my wife and I are not extremely demanding people and we both thought the food at this resort was good, even at the buffet, which a lot of people wrote they didn\u2019t particularly enjoy. Although the hotel does somewhat cater to the European guests in that they offer a lot of European food, particularly Italian food. There was a large variety pizza, a pasta bar, bread and olive oil. We like this type of food and there was also a large variety of other types of food including meats such as beef, pork, chicken and some fish. There was also always some Mexican food at the buffet, although wasn\u2019t as big of variety of Mexican food as I would like, but again no big deal. They also always had an abundance of very tasty, and fresh guacamole, salsa, and very good corn chips. There was also a salad bar, and fresh fruit. They had an assortment of different fruit juices and sodas that came out of a self-serve fountain like are in American restaurants. They also had beer, and wine on tape. I don\u2019t drink wine much so I can\u2019t say how good of wine it actually was but I found it to be kind of a novelty because one never sees wine on tape in America, at least the part of America I\u2019m from The breakfasts at the buffet were also very good. They serve the traditional American breakfast and there is a guy who will make your omelet to order, or cooked your eggs any other way you like them. They have hash brown patties, sausage, cereal, a variety of fruit, cereal, milk, chocolate milk, and a variety of fruit juices as well. The La Carte restaurants were also good. All the La Caret restaurants offer a nicer ambiance than the buffet and Snack bar, and they are all air conditioned except the Italian one which is located at the top the cabana which covers the Beach bar area were air conditioned. The Italian La caret restaurant is opened air and offers a wonderful view. I had read about the hassles incurred by many prior guests regarding making reservations for La Carte Restaurants, but for whatever the reason we did not have these problems and made our reservations the evening we got their at the guest service deck. Something I was told that I had not read was for every seven days you are only suppose to be able to get reservations at the La carte restaurants twice if you staying for seven days as we did but the lady let us make three, again I\u2019m not sure why. There is a Mexican, Italian, and Mediterranean/sea food La caret restaurant at the Viva Maya , and three la caret restaurants you can access by reservation through the Viva Maya\u2019s sister resort the Viva Aztec, is located about 1/2 to 1 mile down the beach toward the city of Playa del Carman. We went to the Mexican at the Viva Maya, which was good but not great, and the Bamboo restaurant, which serves Japanese and is located at the Viva's sister motel the Aztec that The Bamboo restaurant was excellent and also had an open sushi bar, and a green salad bar available for appetizers, which I could have made a meal out of in and of itself. We also had reservation for the Viva Cafe, which is associated with Wyndham resorts and is located in the City of Play del Carman. This restaurant costs an additional $10 U.S>. Dollars each person but is suppose to be good Italian food. The day we had the reservations for the Viva cafe I consumed a bite to many Cervaza's (beer) and we ended up just going to the snack bar that evening for dinner. That leads to the snack bar review. We also felt the snake bar offered good food. It is situated under a large cabana and is located next to the pool, pool bar, and the beach. The breakfast at the snack bar is similar as the buffet breakfast, and as is the case at the buffet, has a guy who cooks omelets and eggs to order. During the day the snack bar serve hamburgers, hot dogs French fries, American style nachos, and pizza that is cooked in a large pizza oven. They also have pasta dishes, salsa, and very good corn chips at the snack bar during the day. There was no fresh guacamole at the snack bar, which was a bite of a disappointment, but it might have been because of the heat, and this really was not a big deal anyway. During the evening until about 11:00 PM you could you could order pizza at the snack bar, which was different than American pizza but very good. During the day the pizza was made and put out in buffet style, but in the evening a server takes your order and then the server would bring it to you once it was made. Also in the evening the pizza seemed to be better and loaded with more cheese. Eating at the snack bar is nice in that it offers shaded setting next to the beach and pool. There is also coffee available at the snack bar, well at least there is early in the morning which made it nice to set on the beach and watch the sun raise over the Caribbean Sea. Bars: There was a nice covered but open-air bar by the lobby and gift shop. The lobby bar served Cervaza (beer), any type of alcoholic drink you could think of, and very good cappuccino, and coffee, but they did not have flavored creamers for the coffee. There was also a bar by the pool that served Cervaza, and the main type of drinks such as margaritas, Pena colada, and the other popular drinks. As far as the drinks go they were better and served higher quality liquor at the main bar, but the pool bar drinks were fine and although the resort only serves one type of Mexican Cervaza/ beer the Cervaza/beer was good and cold at both places. I don't remember the name of the Cervaza/beer but it was fine and stronger than the beer in Utah where we can only get 3.2 % beer at the bars. Only serving this type of beer may be a problem for some, but not me. Also the drinks are some times a little weak unless you ask them to make them a little stronger and that is no problem. Also the beer comes in about 8 oz plastic glasses, which are similar to the water glasses at a lot of U.S. restaurants, but they will serve you two at a time if you ask. Also you can bring an insulated mug from home and they will put your bear or mixed drink in the mug you give them. The beach bar clothes about 10:00 or 11:00 PM and opens and 10:00 Am. I am not sure but I don\u2019t think the main bar by the lobby ever closes. Beach: The beach is beautiful. Playa Car is similar to the hotel zone in Cancun in that resorts line the beach. Playa Car starts at just south of the dock in Playa del Carmen and goes for a few miles. The beach is lined with resort hotels; with each of the hotels having it's own area by the ocean. The Caribbean Sea is a brilliant turquoise color and is simply beautiful. The beach while not as brilliant white as the Cancun beaches is very nice. The hotel staff kept the beach clean and racked it each morning. The ocean water was not only beautiful it was as warm as a cool bath. The water went out a good 50 yards without going over six or so feet and for the first twenty or thirty yards was not much more than four feet deep. The waves were generally quit pleasant and not to large. The beach in front of the Viva Maya is very nice and while it would be nice if it were larger it was the biggest between it and the city of Playa Del Carmen, which is a mile or two to the south. The beach gets bigger as you go north, but the thing I noticed as I walked the beach was how the Viva Maya\u2019s pool and beach bar/ snake bar are located right next to the beach while the other hotels had theirs located further back from the beach. The beach is quit crowed and there are beach chairs lined up right next to one another all over the beach expect for the area where there is a volley ball net set up. Hurricane Wilma and Emily blew down the Palpas and now they hand out beach Umbrellas that you put in the sand next to your chair, and did seem to work well. When you check into the hotel you get a towel card and every morning at 7:00 Am they hand out towels and you can check out an umbrella. The only two negatives of the trip, and one was actually not a problem was 1) people get up early and reserve beach chairs. I always got up early plus I liked being in the back so as I could people watch so getting a chair was not a problem even the couple of day I got out to the beach at around (7:30 Am.) Most of the time I was at the beach by at least 6:30 AM and a couple of days even earlier to watch the sun rise over the ocean, which was kind of cool. The only real negative of the resort was is there are only so many umbrellas and you have to be at the beach at 7:00 Am to check one out returning it at the end of the day. If you don\u2019t get an umbrella it is very hot even though there always seemed to be a breeze blowing off the ocean, which always seemed to keep you cool enough if you had the shade of an umbrella. You check out a beach towel at the same time but there always seemed to be beach towel available no matter what time you got to the beach. Some people told me some people take their towel and umbrella back to their room, which would probably be a good idea. They make you give your room # when you check the towel and umbrella out with the beach card they give you when you check in but I guess they don\u2019t come after you if you don\u2019t bring it back the same day you checked it out as your told to do. Also when you reserve your chair you can leave and walk around the resort as long as you leave your towel on the chair. This is a practice which a sign says your not suppose to do but everyone does it so I would suggest doing it or you will undoubtedly lose your spot. Oh I mentioned people watching on the beach. This was very fun. I especially enjoyed watching the Europeans both because they are uninhibited and because the women whether they are younger and beautiful or older and average looking are generally very uninhibited and comfortable with their bodies which made for some outstanding people watching. Oh ya, not a lot, but a few of the European women don't wear their tops on the beach which at first was a bite fascinating (in I am an American male and this practice is not allowed at public beaches in America). The Pool was ok, but I don\u2019t think it is big enough for the amount of rooms at the resort but it was cool they had a pool bar with bar stools in the pool. Kids could sit there and get sodas, or adults could order soda or alcohol and sit in the pool. There is also another pool at the front of the resort that is much quieter/ no music playing, as was always the case by the beach pool. There was a bar set up by that pool as well. I walked by the pool and there were always a few people there but it did not interest me much. The grounds of the Viva Maya were beautiful, well maintained, and kept very clean It was like a little paradise. The only sign of any hurricane damage was some of the palm trees particularly the ones on the beach had been stripped by the hurricanes last season and their foliage while present is not as full as it would have otherwise been. The rest of the resort and it foliage looked as if it either did not sustain as much damage or it has grown back faster. One thing I noticed that I found a bite peculiar was there were not many public garbage cans, but never the less the resort seemed to be kept nearly spotless of trash because some staff member is always picking trash up. Activities: There is always something going on. The activities staff was outstanding and very energetic. They go all day and into the night and never seem to get tired or at least they don\u2019t show it. There is a theater and the same staff that are running the activities IE Aerobics, water sports for the ocean and swimming pool, darts, ceramic painting, est. are the same people who act in the plays. They make it know anyone is welcome to participate by going around the pool and beach area inviting people and then making an announcement over the load speaker, but they do not pressure you to participate. I think it was 9:30 the show started and it lasted about one hour. One night they had a beach party following the play, and the beach bar stayed open until about 12:00. They are not broad way type shows but they are entertaining and great if you have children. I did not bring kids but the kid\u2019s club staff was great and provided a lot of structured activities for the children. There is also a fairly well equipped gym, which is free to use. There is also a spa at the resort where they offer messages and other spa treatments for an additional charge. For an additional charge you can also get a message on the beach under a small cabana. The resort was in the process of up grading there spa facilities while my wife and me were at the resort and we were told these upgrades should be completed in the near future. We did not receive spa services so I can\u2019t comment on the quality of the spa service offered at this resort Finally a couple of general tips, which I feel, will enhance your vacation at this wonderful resort. 1)Get up early to reserve an umbrella or you will not get one and it is very hot setting on the beach in the middle of the day without shade. 2)Get up early and reserve your spot on the beach or around the pool by putting your stuff or a towel on the chair. 3)Bring about $50 to $100 one-dollar bills with you to use as tips. The hotel is advertised as all inclusive and none of the staff ever ask for a tip but you can turn the service of a Three star hotel into the service of a Four star by tipping. I got this tip from someone else and it was very helpful. The guests are at least 80% European and for whatever the reason they do not tip much. Tipping will get you quicker and better service in all aspects of the resort. The staff all seem very grateful for the tip and it is kind of fun to tip here for that reason and the fact they seem so happy to receive just a dollar tip where in the U.S. a Dollar tip is most times considered a insult. If you forget the one-dollar bills you can go across the street from the resort where there is a bank and a strip mall tourist shopping area and get a Mexican coin that is worth just less than a U.S. dollar. I ran out of my $50 one dollar bills and went over there and think I got around sixty of these coins for $50 I think it was a ten Paso coin. They don\u2019t have the equivalent in paper money. Tip the room maid for better room service, the bar tender for quicker service. Est. 4)Take a taxi for $5 to Playa Del Carman and check out the festive environment. They also having many different kinds of restaurant including many, which serve great lobster and shrimp. When we were there the going rate for prepared lobster was .70 U.S. Cents per pound. 5)Bring about eight feet of light weight cord to tie on your balcony or just outside your patio door as a clothesline. 6) Bring at least two swimsuits. 7)Bring lots of Sun block. 8)Bring your own soap & shampoo so if you don\u2019t get any in you room it won\u2019t be a problem. 9)Bring your own alarm clock. 10) Bring flip-flops to wear at the beach and pool area. 11) During the day take the stairs located by the beach bar which takes you to where the Italian La caret restaurant is in the evening. It is opened aired, shaded, un-crowded and offers a 360 degree wonderful view of the beach pool area, the resort grounds. There are chairs and tables up there as well. It is a great place to sit and have a drink during the day. The resort does not promote this area so not many people are up there during the day, but it is not off limits so check it out it was kind of cool. Thank you to all the Viva Maya staff.

The Good: 1. Great Beach 2. Only a $5 dollar cab ride from the main \"downtown\" area 3. Great drinks made at the ba. 4. Great watersports available (we boogie boarded and did a catermeran) The Cons: 1. Check-in in extremly slow and the employees at the front desk are rude 2. Cleaning of the room is varied and you never no if you are going to get new towels or towels at all. 3. The food really isn't that great, but we didn't care because there were so many neat places to eat in town that even if the food had been awesome I don't think we would have eaten dinner at the hotel Overall tips for a trip to Playa del Carmen 1. Take the bus from the airport. We took the shuttel on the way to the hotel and regreted it, took 2 hours and cost $36. Took the bus on the way back and it only took 50 minutes and was only $16 (these could have been round trip tickets) 2. If you are looking for an excursion I hilghly recomend the Coba Mayan Experince offered through All tour native. You get to zip line through the joungle, reppel, canon, see the Coga ruins, and swim in a Cenote(which is a must). Overall this hotel is a good value and I would stay there again. Just stay away from teh front desk, they will put you in a bad mood.

My boyfriend and I (we're 29) just got back from Playa this past Saturday 4/29/06. It was wonderful. Our experiences... Cancun Airport...horrible, totally disorganized and chaotic. Once we finally got out luggae and went to get transportation even that took forever because we were going to do the van thing (cheaper) but after waiting awhile I said forget it and paid the extra for a taxi, it was about $50US and about 45 minute drive but definitely worth it just to get there and not have to make any other stops on the way. But...if you take a cab to the resort it is called \"Viva Maya\" to the locals, put Wyndham in there and they aren't sure where you want to go really. Resort: Checking in was a huge problem...very slow, not enough people, it was hot and humid and the lady I was dealing with just kept walking away. That I was very disappointed in. Our room was nice, king bed, mini fridge (that they never did refill with soda (only bottled water), which was fine for me since I prefer water but many people don't. The pool was nice, very warm, not too crowded and great to just relax. Although it is true what others have said about the pool chairs...get there early to reserve or you won't find one. The food...mediocre at best. By the 2nd day od buffet for dinner we were done with it. We ate at the restaurants La Scala at Azteca, Miramare and Hacienda Don Diego. All were decent and much better than the buffet. Two other nights we ate downtown. For breakfast it was fine, lunch we weren't usually around but picked the pool place to eat usually if we were. Drinks were okay and strong...try the Yellow Bird or Banana Mama. There is a shopping plaza across from the resort, about a 5 minute or less walk thats cute. Downtown is a long walk that we didn't take but did ride the bikes that were free to use from the resort. A cab ride to and from downtown from the resort is 50 pesos. They had night shows that we never went to, we spent our time downtown and checked out some of the local places and shopped at night...when it was cooler and less humid. The maid service was good, although we denied it 2 days just becuase we were there napping or something when she got there. Tips are much appreciated out there, even at the restaurants and I noticed no one tipped hardly. We were generous for the good service for sure. The locals were very nice. The resort was very European...lots fo French...another story in its own but I won't get into that. Overall it was a great trip!

My mother who is 66, and my two children 18 and 20 who each brought a friend 18 and 20 enjoyed our vacation at the Maya! It was great and all three generations found something to do. It was our first time in Playa Del Carmen. We had ocean view and connecting rooms. The rooms were small but clean. None of us had trouble sleeping, the beds were fine and we did not hear much noise with the air conditioner running. We met so many nice people including some of the staff. The kids came home with email addresses of friends they had met there. The food was not bad at all. You just pick items that you like from the buffet and stick with those. The fruit was some of the best I have ever had. We did eat ala carte a few times and enjoyed the differences they all brought to the table. The kids got up later and ate later. I loved the all inclusive idea especially with a family. It was fun to have the first floor ocean view and be close to the coffee, food, restuarant reservation waiting line, umbrella line, entertainment and bar!! My daughter and son participated in the dance lessons, volleyball and other activities that were offered by the wonderful staff. Very nice people that work so hard! The grounds were so clean and beautiful. We went to Xel-Ha (shel ha) one day and we would not do that again. It was really crowded, the snorkeling stunk and we had to wait in too many lines. We went tubing down the 'river' and it was bad. No movement in the water at all to get anywhere. Everyone had to get in the water and swim or paddle with thier hands. It was very crowded. I would rather have been at the Maya Wyndham and relaxing or doing something there and saved my money. Shopping is only a $5.00 taxi cab away. You can fit about 4 people in a taxi, so that is a little over $1.00 each. Downtown Playa was so much fun. Shops, people watching and restaurants were all there. I felt comfortable to let the 18 and 20 year olds take a taxi downtown and hit a few clubs. They had a blast!!!! We checked out Azteca, the sister hotel. It was much smaller and the beach was not nearly as nice. You do have to be patient when checking in and dealing with the front desk. Their english is not very good.

She went at 1:00 am to get a new one and the gentleman(?) behing the desk dangled a new one in front of her and said for $100 US she could have it. She came to our room and told me in the morning. I went down after reading the guest manual, which said we could get a new one for $10. The lady(again ?) behind the front desk told me she did not have any, I would have to return at 11:00, my daughter was leaving on an excursion at 8:00 am and needed the bracelet to board the boat. Again we were told by the desk clerk she had none. I explained that I had read in their manual that for a $10 fee we could get a new one. Her expression changed, she took the $10(which I am sure she kept)and unlocked a drawer, took out a bracelet and gave it to my daughter.

My wife and I have been married three years, 30 years old, have no kids, and love to party. If this does not fit your demographic, you might want to stop reading. Playacar was the best vacation we have ever had. We have been to Fiji, St Thomas, Aruba, Cayman and a host of other hot spots. That said, Playa del Carmen beat them all. We were there for 8 days, 7 nights and the weather was perfect. High 80's, perfectly sunny everyday. We live in San Diego, CA, so we are used to nice weather and this place blew away SD weather. The Viva Wyndham Maya was an amazing value for what you received. The rooms are not spectacular, but who stays in their room on vacation anyway? The staff did a great job keeping them clean, and did turndown service at night. You will hear a lot of complaints about the beds being hard, which they were, but if that's what ruins your vacation, you're not enjoying life. Here are the highlights and some tips for staying at the Viva Maya: * Make sure you get the room you reserved. They tried to give us a \"lesser\" room, but after some discussion and debate, they moved things around and we had our ocean view, third room floor. It was beautiful to wake up to the sun rising in the morning. * They have the pool bar and main buffet which are both above average. Food is not spectacular, but there are plenty of healthy options which my wife and I enjoyed (fish, vegs, fruit, self serve beer etc). * To get reservations at the restaurants, you have to get up at about 8:00am, which you have the choice of Mexican, Mediterranean and Italian. Our favorite place was Miramare which was near the pool where you could enjoy the night and ocean breezes. Food was above average at all restaurants. * If you want to have a nice spot on the beach (with some shade), you have to put your towels out around 8:00am. If you had a late night (which we had many), make sure you get up and drop your towels down. It takes 2 minutes. Make sure you don't lose your towels, otherwise they will charge you $20USD. We left ours at the beach overnight (oops), so we paid the price. * The gym is nice with up to date equipment and friendly staff. If you need some help working out, they are there to assist you. * Viva Maya provides bikes free of charge which you can use for 3 hours. I suggest taking the bikes for a ride into downtown or through the hotel district. It's a nice ride. * The activities staff are awesome. They are a little crazy, but keep everyone from 4 years old to 84 years old entertained. They do dance lessons, spanish lessons, water polo, aerobics, volleyball etc etc. If you can't find anything to do, you must be passed out. * The nightlife is a little weak at Viva Maya. They have a couple bars and a night club, but they are better suited for the teens (16-20) or the older folks who just want to relax. For us, we went into downtown every night. Have a chat with Eden at the front bar, awesome guy. * The shows they put on at Viva Maya are a cheesy, but great for the kids. I didn't see many couples hanging out to watch the shows, we mainly watched for entertainment and laughter. That said, it was a nice touch and if we had kids would have been down there. One night when we stayed in the show kept us up, but otherwise it was not an issue. If you like going to bed at 9 PM, you will be kept awake by the show. Playa del Carmen... Downtown is very nice. It reminds us of Old Town in San Diego but much bigger. There are a million shops for the ladies to browse, restaurants, bars, nightclubs etc. We had an amazing time every night downtown. The best place we found was called Kartabar, which was located close to the Blue Parrot night club (there's a sign on 5th ave for Blue Parrot). Kartabar played nice hip hop, loungy and good people. We partied with many folks including the waitresses there. I think we went there 4 or 5 nights. Another nice place was on 5th avenue (can't remember the name) where they have swings as seats around the bar. Beers and shots are cheap and was a great place to kick the night off. The Blue Parrot was a little young, but the crowd was mixed and the music was good. We went there once or twice. Another nice place in that area was Om, which had a nice lounge and excellent music. Overall, the night life had a little bit of everything. All in all, this vacation was amazing. While our next trip will take us to Greece, Playacar is a place we will come back to many times in the future.", "Date": "April 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "clbalo", "ReviewID": "UR4973461", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from a short vacation at the Viva Wyndham Maya on April 12.

On our last day I decided to treat myself to a massage! It was well worth-it! The sound of the waves and the breeze couldn't be beat! There are also options to do parasailing, fishing, and renting wave runners, but these are at an extra cost. POOL The pool is huge and there are many beach chairs available, too, however, we got up each morning to sit in line for reservations to the specialty restaurants (you're read other reviews about how frustrating that part is) and put our towels down on our chairs around 7 am. The first day we didn't know to do that and there weren't any chairs left around the pool by 9 am. There is also a \"Relax Pool\" with it's own pool bar. There was no music or games or anything at this pool, so it is a little more relaxing This one always had beach chairs available. FOOD We weren't overly-impressed with the food. There's a snack bar by the main pool that had a great breakfast and wonderful french fries at lunch and dinner. They also had wood-fired pizzas, hot dogs, hamburgers, lots of fruit, chips and cheese and empaniadas. It was open until 6 PM. and then re-opened after 10 PM and was open all night! The buffet was OK. Lots of food to choose from but nothing spectacular. Our favorite restaurant was Portofino followed by La Scala at the sister hotel, Azteca. All of the waiters at all the restaurants were very friendly and helpful. BAR The swim-up bar at the main pool was by-far our favorite. We tipped the bartender on our first day and every time we were getting low on our drinks there was a fresh one waiting. We also tipped the guy who walks around the pool picking up empty glasses and plates and he brought us drinks by the pool and wherever we went on the beach. They don't expect tips and don't look for them, but I iknow they appreciate them! It's amazing what $5 will do! There was also a bar by the \"Relax Pool\" that made great smooties and another bar by the lobby that was a little more formal, although I did see people eating and drinking in bathing suits. ROOMS The rooms were small and the beds were hard, but we didn't mind. We weren't in there except to sleep anyway! We did have some problems with the housekeeping person not giving us water bottles. One day they didn't leave one so I called down to the front desk to request some and 2 1/2 hours later they finally came by with some! We also found out 3 days into our stay that some rooms had fully-stocked refrigerators. We would've enjoyed a cold water in the morning, so we called to see if that was an option. The guest services people said they'd bring one right up! But it wasn't there by the next day, so I called again......It still wasn't there by the time we left. We were a little bummed by that, although it didn't ruin our stay! ENTERTAINMENT As I mentioned before, the entertaiment team was amazing. They were a group of people that really wanted everyone to have fun! They would go around the pool and beach and ask people to get involved. The first day we just sat and relaxed by the pool, but when we decided to get involved, we had a blast! They teach you how to do the Salsa, Marange (I don't know how to spell it). There's stretching in the morning, then aerobics in the pool. Other activities were Beach volleyball, pool basketball, water polo, crazy beach olympics, bikini contest and more! Then at night, they'd put on some amazing shows! We saw an authentic Mayan/Mexican dance, a Michael Jackson show, Mulan Rouge, Caberet, and more. They were really good. We enjoyed watching them, and it was fun to see them on the beach the next day. KIDS CLUB There was a Kids club available from 9:30-5:30 every day. They would do an activity in the morning like potter painting and then come to the pool for swimming. Then they would go to lunch as a group around noon and have movie time at 1:30. My kids wanted to be in the pool, so they usually skipped the movie. Then after the movie they'd come back out by the pool for a tournament or game of some sort. They played water basketball, water polo, beach soccer, etc. At 9:15 PM, they would get the kids to go up on stage before the main entertainment and they'd annoiunce the winners of the kids activities and they'd get a medal and then they'd play a game like musical chairs or something and the winners would get a t-shirt. My kids are a little shy, but Michelle and Alyssa at the Kids Club were so warm and friendly to them that they just loved being around them! They went up on stage and had so much fun. They day we left we all cried to say goodby to these wonderful caring girls! OVERALL We would definatly stay Viva Maya again! It was so sad to leave. We've been to many other all-inclusive resorts in the past and this one ranked right up there with the best we've been. It's not a Sandles or luxery resort, but we felt we got our money's worth and came home with amazing memories that we'll never forget! Just remember to go in with the attitude of having fun and looking for the good instead of the bad! :-)", "Date": "April 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cNot a typical Wyndham\u201d", "Author": "Jazzman", "ReviewID": "UR4934830", "Content": "We went in Mid March and found that although this Hotel has the Wyndham name attached to it it really is a Viva Hotel If you are looking for a nice quiet place to relax and sit in the sun with no frill rooms or food it is perfect. If you want better then average you are in the wrong place. The Hotel is at least 90% European which in simple terms means that very little English is spoken or understood by staff of guests. We had lots of problems trying to communicate with the staff but once we made ourself understood they were very helpful The buffet was avcerage at best food never really hot and choices were limited. After the first day you pretty much knew where everything would be. We made all our dinner reservations on before we arrived with the Wyndham By Request people(sent them an e-mail)and when we arrived our reservations were waiting Had a major problem checking in as when we got to the desk we found out our reservations were cancelled even though they Were paid in full. Management of Hotel were not at all helpful getting it resolved but finally when they corrected the error(over an hour and a half latter) we went to our room in the new wing. The new wing (R00ms 3000-3350) are in what is called the quiet section and they have all the amenities the others do not have including a jaccuzi. It is at the other end of the Hotel furthest from the beach (only a 2-4 minute walk) but it has an adult only pooL, its own bar and most important plenty of shade where the beach has limited shade due to the fact the trees have not grown back yet. There is ample place for sitting by the pool and beach and the snack bar has food all day long. This is a Three star Hotel that caters to Europeans and the if you accept that and do not plan to spend to much time in rooms or expect great food it is perfect.

As college professors on spring break, we feared we would be surrounded by partying students -- we weren't, thankfully. We haven't stayed at all-inclusives previously, so I can't compare the Viva Maya to others. However, I can say that the scenery was gorgeous, we had no bug problems (and I really hate bugs), our room was VERY clean each day, and my 6- and 9-year old kids cried like crazy when it was time to leave. The food was OK -- I can see why others who have been spoiled by better food in other places would complain. But it was more than adequate for our needs. The drinks at the pool-side bar always tasted weird -- almost like they were mixed with salt water or something. But that was the only major taste complaint. I agree with someone's previous comment about bringing chocolate if you have a sweet tooth-- bring your own M&M's -- it is $2 for a little bag of them in the store across from the hotel. But there's always lots of fruit and salty snacks available. We went to Playa Del Carmen for over-priced Haagen Daaz when we wanted ice cream. The location of this hotel is very nice, in that it's a nice bike ride (and you just get a bike from the hotel for free, which is convenient) to Playa Del Carmen, which is a fun place to go shop for a few hours. We booked through Vacation Express, and many of the other hotels available were really out in the middle of nowhere, and I was glad to be where we were. One thing that was annoying to us was the reservation system for eating at the sit-down restaurants. I had to go wait in line at 7 am each day if we wanted to eat somewhere other than the buffet place (and after a week there, we were ready for eating elsewhere). And while some resorts have many restaurants to choose from, Viva Maya really has only 3 plus the buffet. And they fill up fast -- my being in line at 7 was no guarantee we'd get in. (I think this situation was particularly bad because it was a busy time of year). My kids loved the towel animals our housekeeper left us each day, and they enjoyed their time in Kids Club, although it was understaffed (sometimes only 1 worker for a dozen kids). The nightly shows began 15 minutes early for kid games on stage, with prizes for the winner -- my 9-year old loved that. The shows, themselves, were for the most part, not things I wanted my kids to see (a lot of bad lip syncing and [--] dancing -- Madonna, Moulin Rouge), so we left after the kids time. A notable exception is the Mexican Folklore night -- they brought in talented Ethnic dancers for that, and the show is very entertaining-- don't miss it. I really enjoyed being around people from all over the world -- you could sit on the beach and hear many languages spoken. Scuba Caribe is a company that runs parasailing, snorkeling, and scuba trips, and it's located right in the hotel, which is convenient. It's $70 total for 2 people to go parasailing, for example. If you are trying to decide on a hotel and are a \"down-to-earth\" sort of person, I can recommend this one. This isn't a place where there are waiters rushing to bring you drinks while you lounge on the beach -- you pretty much have to go get drinks yourself. But it's really a gorgeous place to be. The pool temp was just perfect. The view out onto the sea from our room was stunning.

There are definitely more extravagant resorts, but they also come with more extravagant prices, especially in the Mayan Riviera it seems. For the very average price, the Viva Maya was more than fine, so I'm giving it an above average rating. Check-in was a breeze, no long line-up. The rooms were minimal, but comfortable and clean. No fridge, no toiletries... but the A/C worked, the TV and remote worked, and we had a little balcony that looked towards the ocean. I'll take that over tiny shampoo bottles any day!! The safe also worked, which was great. About a dozen hangers. Our room was cleaned at the same time every day, by 10 or 11 a.m. And yes, it's true, the beds are very hard, but it was good for my back. Very basic rooms, but we found ours was all we needed, with no problems. The beach is very nice, with lots of beach chairs, so no problem there. Not as many chairs around the pool, but we preferred sitting at the beach. A little disappointed there were no palapas anymore... but there are enough palm trees to find shade if you need it. Activity staff was friendly, but never too pushy. We did water aerobics and stretching classes, which happened every day. Ask one of the activity staff for the schedule. I also had a massage in the beach hut one afternoon, which was just awesome. The best surprise was having breakfast and lunch served at the pool snack bar, so you didn't have to go to the buffet restaurant if you didn't feel like it. My favourite thing was going down for coffee at the snack bar in the morning, then finding our beach chairs for the day. The breakfast served there was great (although the eggs were often cold unless you got to them right away -- go for the made-to-order omelettes instead.) Lots of fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal, bacon, hashbrowns, juice at the bar. They even installed a cappuccino machine at the pool bar before we left, but it wasn't working yet. Lunch at the snack bar was also good, and they have fresh fruit and snacks out all afternoon: chips, fresh salsa and guacamole! The best. And more fries than you should eat in a week!! For dinner, the buffet gets boring, but there's lots to choose from, and it was much better than I expected (after reading some of the reviews here.) Believe me, you won't go hungry at the Viva Maya unless you choose to be a culinary snob. We had dinner at two of the a la carte restaurants, but not the ones at the Viva Maya. We went to La Scala at the Viva Azteca, which was very nice. And we also went to the Viva Cafe in downtown PDC, where you pay an extra $10 (it goes on your room bill.) It was excellent, and it is right across the street from the Blue Parrot, so a good place to go for a night on the town. Their chocolate mousse was amazing! Another pleasant Viva Maya surprise was the guitar player in the lobby bar, who played a couple nights that we were there. I'm coming up the walk one evening towards the lounge, and suddenly I hear this song... I'm like... \"Is that... Pink Floyd?!?\" The guy was playing Brain Damage!! Pretty good, too, for playing it solo. He did lots of rock covers and some Spanish stuff too. The lobby bar was fun to hang out in at night, if you don't feel like venturing downtown. We really didn't watch any of the hotel's shows... not our thing. They did have a Mexican fiesta one night, and a couple nights had vendor booths set up in the courtyard area, which made for convenient shopping! The hotel had bikes, kind of cool, old-style cruising bikes. I've seen worse bikes around the streets of Toronto. The ride to town is an easy 10 minutes on a fairly quiet road through Playacar. We also booked a couple very reasonably priced excursions through the hotel. One was a snorkel/catamaran trip; and the other was a half-day tour of Tulum. They were each about $45 US. We found no problem communicating with the hotel staff. But then, we didn't exactly expect the maids or the entire staff to speak perfect English. The service was excellent from everyone we encountered. I'm sure people run into the odd problem at this or any hotel, but in my opinion, people that complain about little things at the Viva Maya must be trying to have a lousy vacation. The only reason I might not go back is because I always try to go somewhere different, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.

We went on a girl\u2019s only vacation to get some sun, and we have both been to Mexico before. We originally booked in Cancun, only to find out that the beaches there were essentially non-existent! So Sunwing and selloffvacations.com moved us to the Mayan. We were very happy with the service we received from both selloffvacations.com, and Sunwing. I was a little concerned as I have always stayed in 5+ star resorts, however I was pleasantly surprised! The Viva Maya was beautiful. The beach was to die for. My husband and I stayed closer to Tulum last time, and I will always return to Playa Car now. The area is gated, so you feel pretty safe walking around. We walked into Playa Del Carmen quite a bit, as it was only a 15 minute walk. It was good to get some exercise, and we were very happy that everything was close by. I cannot emphasize how nice the beach was though. The weather was good too; it only rained on the last day. The service at this resort was amazing! I was astounded to read other reviews! Everyone bent over backwards to accommodate us. Maybe it was because we are female! David on the beach was our favourite. He was always looking out for us, and making sure we were okay. As for the language issue, I don't think I met anyone that did not speak English on the staff! I was actually really surprised. People should keep in mind that they are travelling to another country. Not everyone speaks ENGLISH!! You may just have to learn some Spanish! The entertainment was okay, as to be expected. However, the entertainers were great! We went out with them one night, and had a great time. We also went into Cancun one night, and it was really interesting! Definitely worth the trip if you are under thirty, or just looking for a good time! As for the food, it was okay. We usually ate at the pool bar. In the morning the pool bar made omelettes and at lunch they had fresh salsa and chips. Dinner was okay in the buffet, but nothing to rave about. The ala cartes are a definite must!! The Portofino restaurant was our favourite! The Mexican was also good. The rooms are okay. Unlike a lot of the reviewers, I go on vacation to see the sights and enjoy my surroundings. I do not go to spend time in the room. Therefore, as long as the room is clean and comfortable, I am happy! All in all, I would recommend this place to anyone, and I would return.

Rooms- First off, I didnt expect much when reading everybody's reviews on the rooms but I dont know if it was the specific room we recieved but I was very surprised. I have stayed at 5 star resorts and this room could compare. We were in the new building built after the hurricane on the 2nd floor with a view of the adult pool which was better then nothing. The bed was king size, there was a nice big jacuzzi, large bathroom with a large shower. Couch, table, fridge, balcony, T.V., safe, everything you needed. Note, we are not wyndham by request members. Food- To tell you the truth, I would have much rather stayed at the buffet the entire time then going to the a la carte restaurants because the food was not awful but not good. With the buffet you had enormous selection that had its staples everyday such as pizza and pasta but they did change a few things day to day. There was always chicken, beef and fish. The desserts were not good, I liked the cheesecake and ice cream but some of the cakes seemed soggy :S. There was ALWAYS food, I really never saw an empty tray and the times of the buffet are something like breakfast 7-11, lunch 12-4:30 and dinner from 6:30-10 so unless you eat 24/7 it is definitely sufficient. And just in case you do eat 24/7 the snack bar is open 24 hours and he will cook you up cheese burgers, nachos and cheese, hotdogs, icecream... whatever really. Beach/Pool- The beach was very beautiful and if you looked around there was always 2 chairs we could round up. Water was warm with very minimal rocks if any. We did some boogy boarding which was very fun. There are two pools, the one by the beach which was pretty crowded and the adult pool which was very peaceful. Bars- These people do no skimp on drinks, if you are all inclusive you are pretty much handed the drinks whether you order them or not. The bartenders could whip you up whatever you wanted, we never were told no. The drinks are pretty good too, didnt seem watered down. The red wine wasnt anything special but the white was good. Shopping- Go to Playa Del Carmen they have absolutely everything you would ever want, and some pretty trendy shops as well. You will get hassled by shop keepers (not the posh shops though) to come in to their store, dont ignore them, just say no thank you. They seem to get really angry if you ignore them. I never went into any shops where the vendors hassled me because chances are, you wont get out. Service- Overall, everyone was very friendly. Whether it was plus 35 celsius and they had a huge load of laundry in their hands or they were just walking by they always had a smile on their faces and say hello. Overall this experience has been absolutely awesome. I would also recommend the hot rock massages at the spa, THE BEST! Well worth the money. So what were the 2 problems? Well my honey tried to get them to put rose pedals and champagne in the room for me one night and guest services said no even though he was willing to pay anything. The other problem was that our flight got delayed overnight and the people at the front desk would not do anything for us but when a couple from another hotel in the same situation as us came to our hotel and got checked in because they had a \"reservation\" supposedly made by our tour operator, we had to demand to see if we had a reservation and sure enough we were supposed to have a room for the night. Seemed like they would have been content with us sitting out in the lobby for 8 hours until it was time to leave. Other than that it was awesome and I would reccomend it to anyone!

Upon check in there was a look of items missing from bathroom (Soap, Shampoo), we add to ask to get the situation rectified, there is also a mini fridge. Content of the fridge, only one beer, how cheap, if your going to put one beer in the fridge, don\u2019t put any. There is a mural air conditioner in the room that works very well, it\u2019s a bit noisy but dampened any outside noise and we slept comfortably each night. We add no problem getting hot water or water pressure in the shower, but the bath cap didn\u2019t work and we add to put a hand towel in the bath hole in order to use the bath. The also did some repair in the bathroom two days in a row and didn\u2019t clean their mess afterword, we add to call each time to get the maid to return and clean up all the dust. Restaurants/food \u2013 Very average, there is a main buffet area (La Terraza) that you will be using for most of your meals, at first the selection seem acceptable and the quality, and variety is acceptable, but the don\u2019t change the buffet is very similar from one meal to an other and it becomes very monotonous. Salad bar is always the same, pasta bar is always the same and the grill is very badly design and there is always a crowd in front of it waiting for the same repetitive food. The dessert have nothing spectacular, cakes you would by at any grocery store, ice cream on the other hand is wonderful but they should have more selection (only two), fruits are also good. Another tip, get to your meals at the Terraza early, because they run out of food fairly quickly and it takes a lot of time to refill the buffet and your selection decreases significantly when you get there later. You can only have breakfast at the Terraza from 6 am to 11. Dinner is served at the Terraza from 12h30 to 15, but you can also eat at the pool area from 11 am to around 6 pm. Pool area serves pizza, burger, hot dog, a small selection of hot meals and a salad bar. Note that the pizza is fairly good and the guacamole is awesome. For supper, you can eat at the Terraza or reserve to an A la carte restaurant, downtown to the Viva Caf\u00e9 or to an a la carte restaurant at the sister resort the Azteca. It is easy to make you\u2019re reservation to an a la carte restaurant upon arrival at the Maya resort of downtown, but for the sister resort the Azteca, you have to wait in line 48 hours prior at the guest service desk at 8 AM to ensure your reservation. We add excellent meals both at the Portofino and the Mexican restaurant, we were seated at the Bamboo restaurant at the Azteca resort ready to order supper when they add a power failure, so after a 30 minutes wait in the dark, we decided to return to the buffet to get something to eat, it was getting pretty late an we were all hungry, note that the menu was very complete if you like asian food and I would highly recommended. We add reservation at the Viva Caf\u00e9, but we decided to cancel it after talking to an other couple who got sick after their meal at the Caf\u00e9. I would recommend that you take all your supper meal at an a la carte restaurant, you won\u2019t miss any thing special at the Terraza, there is nothing special at night at the Terraza. If you expect to eat any seafood there you will be very disappointed, there is no sea food there, you won\u2019t even see a small shrimp. They should consider giving full access to sister resort the Azteca, it would greatly improve everybody vacation experience. Bars \u2013 Bar were also a small disappointment, the drink seems to be watered down, the choice of liqueur is also a bit limited compare to the previous hotel we visited. Beer at the resort is acceptable, but there not much of a selection. Vine is awful at the Terraza, but acceptable at the a la carte restaurants, waiters are cheap hoverer on refueling you glass unless you tip them regularly. Note that Carlos when out of is way to give us an awesome service at the pool bar. Eder and Julio are pretty friendly barmen as well. Some of the staff made up for other because the general attitude is; I will not go out of my way to do my job well unless you tip me, which is a bit disappointing. Grounds - The grounds are clean but the resort is too small to my liking, if you like walking you will soon be bored of the same scenery, we will look at a bigger resort next time 400 rooms is too small. Some pathways are covered so that you can stay dry if it rains, it give the resort a very exotic look. Beach/Pool \u2013 Big disappointment there, pool is way too small for the number of guest, there is not enough chair around the pool and people leave there towels on the chairs so you can\u2019t use them, the kids pool is also ridiculously small. Overall the pool is not inviting for children or adults so we stayed away from them for most part. The beach is average, the sand is perfect, but there is not enough room on the beach and all the chairs are one again each other. Air and Water temperature in January, was perfect and we didn\u2019t even have to use the air conditioner at night. We didn\u2019t make use of any of the equipment they add there so we can\u2019t comment on them. Activities - Although we did not participate in any of the organized activities. Our kids visited the Kids Club three day, we were hesitant at first to send them there, but they add a good time and wanted to return, the organizer were friendly and competent. We attended one evening show (Madonna) is was good and entertaining. Shopping \u2013 If you want to avoid the tourist trap, you should start your shopping at Walmart or at Chedraui (Mexican superstore) at Playa Del Carmen. Playa Del Carmen shopping area is a 20 minutes walk from the resort or a 5$ US. If you plan to shop on 5th Avenue (Visitor tourist area in Playa Del Carmen) you should start from the end of the 5th avenue, not from the beginning, it\u2019s more expensive. There is also a small mall across the street from the resort that has almost anything that you could want. Note that you will be approach all the time with time-share salesmen starting right from the airport. One thing we like when we travel is to visit grocery store and buy food items that you can find back home (spices, candy, vanilla, etc). Tours \u2013 Tour sold to any tourist are very expensive and should be avoided in our opinion. We took the Cab down to Tulum to visit the pyramid for 40$ US, the driver can give you very good information about is country and you can learn Spanish also. The entrance to the pyramid is 45 pesos (note they don\u2019t take US dollars), it\u2019s free for the children. There is also no need to take a guide, as every thing is very well explained on the site, don\u2019t forget to bring your bathing suits, we spent around 1 hour on the beautiful beach behind the pyramid. For the return, we used the Collectivo (local bus), it\u2019s a mini van and only cost 25 pesos (2.50$US) per adult, free for the children, you could use that service as well to go down there leaving from Playa Del Carmen. Overall \u2013 Note that if you are a By Request member, they will not honor it if you booked you trip with a tour operator, you will only get the advantages if you have book your stay directly with Wyndham. Our experience at that resort is definitely average and I would recommend that you spend a few extra hundred dollars to get a much better experience and stay elsewhere.", "Date": "February 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Regina, SK", "Title": "\u201cSome good; some bad\u201d", "Author": "Jasper7", "ReviewID": "UR4462696", "Content": "We stayed in the Viva Wyndham Maya from Feb 5-12, 2006. Check-in went smoothly however I had previously signed up to Wyndham ByRequest rewards and indicated my hotel preferences - none of which were filled during out stay. The hotel desk staff speak limited English but the staff at the a la carte booking desk spoke fantastic english and were very willing to help us translate. The room is so-so. Uncomfortable beds, no shampoos or soaps, no coffee maker, loud A/C but it worked very well. There is however use of a safe and iron with ironing board. Some of the rooms had a refridgerator and more TV Channels - our room had 12 but only 4 were English. Room was clean, no major problems, maids created new towel art on a daily basis. Make sure you put your Do Not Disturb sign on the door or the maids walk right in at all times of the day. The complex is nice. Constant improvements being made to the resort. It's small but has nice walkways, pool area (small) and beach. Good location, walking distance to Playa Del Carmen. Bikes leave something to be desired - old and rickety. Saw many come back with the chains fallen off. Food - in the buffet - mediocre at best. Did not change much from day to day - or even from lunch to dinner. Most items cooked in oil - salad was available but no variety there either. Most items are luke warm at best - no traditional mexican type dishes as I had expected. Food variety not much different from what I can eat here - that was a disappointment. A la carte restaurants were good. Three at the Maya (we tried two - Portofino's and the Mexican one - Portofino's had good food, small portions, Mexican restaurant better) and there's Italian and Asian a la carte's at the Viva Azteca that were available at no charge. They were by far THE BEST! Actually, the buffet meal at the Azteca seemed superior to the Viva Maya as well. Shows are average - if you like some dancing and lip syncing. Nothing spectacular. Lots of activities on the beach and pool area - however a bit annoying that the staff disrupts the guests by trying to constantly recruit people by yelling the activity over and over. Not always as relaxing as it could be. Watch out for the timeshare people - they are everywhere. They claim to have a \"welcome package\" but it's a trick to lure you in. Heard of people spending any where from 2 to 4 hours of their time with these people. The week we were there, good mixture of ages but predominantly Italian guests. We guess about 95% european when we were there - not much english being spoken in conversations so meeting other couples was a challenge. I found the staff very friendly and accomodating whenever possible however I think the hotel rating of 3.5 star is accurate.

The service at the hotel was awesome, the best that I've had in Mexico. The hotel itself is convenient and centrally located, about a 10-minute walk to the town of Playa Del Carmen or a $5 taxi ride. Eder, one of the bartenders made a 'mean' americano coffee and always had a smile. Although we had paid for a superior ocean view room, we didn't quite get a superior room. In fact, we saw a few rooms and none of them were 'superior' by any means. The rooms at the Wyndham are 'very average', and not maintained very well. The pool is rather small so we spent most of our time at the beach, which was beautiful and clean. We tried all 3 a la carte restaurants and found them to be 'very average'. We have been to a few all inclusive resorts in Peurto Vallarta and Manzanillo and were extremely pleased with the a la carte restaurants, but the Wyndham's were very average. The food was always the same at the buffet and the a la carte restaurants had similar foods as the buffet, so not much of a change. Lots of pasta...I suppose catering to all the Italian guests, so not much variety. Breakfast buffets were the 'best'. The spa is nice, we used the steam room and whirlpools often. Did go for a massage/pedicure/manicure, and they were 'average' for a lot of $$'s. All in all, I would rate the Wyndham Maya a \"3\" star resort.

Our room was perfect in the new block they have built next to a very quiet pool nobody seemed to know about. Had large room, 2 Large beds Great Bathroom with big Jacuzzi style bath (fantastic for relaxing after a day in the sun) Shower, Double basins and Toiletries, Towels were plenty always fluffy and new. Room had Safe, TV and Fridge, plenty of drawers and fitted wardrobes Air Con was very quiet, but we tended to use the ceiling fan at night. Maid was fantastic, though did come too early some mornings, our do not disturb sign went missing! Breakfast Lunch and Dinner in the main Dinning room was Great, lots to choose from and some awesome Deserts. Coke Lemonade and Beer on serve yourselve taps. Chef cooking Pasta all the time and another cooking meats. Salads were always very fresh. And if you didn't feel like a big meal, there was always tasty Pizza. The A La Carte Resturants were the best, not too much choice but great food, they will cook you something veggi or slightly different if you ask. And if you dont feel like bothering, the Snack Bar by the pool was just as good when you do get hungry Pool Bar and the Bar by reception were nice. Staff were always quick to serve you and would make any combination up for you. They have a large cocktail list too, so start from the top of the list. We never tried the disco, the day was too tiring as it was, boringly we were in bed by midnight most nights. The Shows weren't to my taste but we did watch a couple and everyone watching seemed to be enjoying them and the annimation teem did a very professional job, but dancing a mimming are not my thing. Pool and the grounds were always very clean tidy and relaxing, Left hand side of Sea was a little rocky as you got in, but if you went over to the right hand side of the beach, there were very few stones and only for the first yard or two. Sunbeds around the Pool were a little scarce. And durring our 2 weeks there was a lot of Empty beds with Towels saving them. I was tempted to remove them! and maybe the Hotel needs to do something about this! But then it happens worldwide, there were always plenty of beds on the beach anyhow. Didnt use any of the free water stuff as I am very happy just having a swim or jump in the waves, but many people were making use. The Tui trips were very expensive and we too were told that other trips did not have any insurance? Didn't quite get that, as surely our Holiday insurance would cover us, as long as we weren't jumping out of planes etc. Sorry Claire Recommend Tulum. do it by bus from Playa del Carmen 6 usd and the entrance was peanuts. Xcaret. 59 usd take a taxi 12 usd each way, there were plenty of Taxi's to bring you back after the show, which is fantastic, and don't forget there are 2 rivers to float down, depends on which route you take at the decision arrow. We liked it so much we went 2 times! A must is Chichen Itza, we got it for 45 usd inc lunch and a cenote stop. though the Journey is long!! Coba was great too and it has the only Temple(pyramid) that you can still climb as Chitchen Itza has now stopped climbers.

We flew in to the airport early evening and from there on it was pretty easy getting our bags and getting to the hotel. We didn't have any problems checking in and our room was neat and clean. The place was very well taken care of and always clean, one of the nicest places that we saw along the beach. We ran into a few problems: on Saturday when we went for our meeting with our Sunquest Rep the people at the desk sent us all over for this meeting, they didn't seem to know where we were to meet him at. We spent about 1/2 hour looking for Hector. There was an office that he had in the building as all reps are in the same office but it seemed that they didn't care about the people that booked through a travel agency, they just wanted to either sell time shares or have you book direct with them. It really wasn't worth meeting with him since he didn't have a whole lot to tell us, just wanted to book excursions. After that if we needed to see him it was pretty impossible since he was hardly ever there. We had also filled out a Wyndham By Request membership and got the run around for 3 days of them promissing us we were going to get it but in the end we did not qualify. Monday when we needed more water, we didn't know that you only get one bottle a day and the water out in the hall that we were supposed to use to refill was broken, for 2 days. I went to the desk and asked for more water and this was when they told me it was only one bottle per day per room. I explained that my husband was sick and needed more water, could not refill at the machine and the person behind the desk was not very happy about giving me another bottle. Some days we did not even get a fresh bottle of water in our room. One thing we did not know was that the beds were on cement pads, only a mattress on the cement. We could not figure out why our backs were so sore but after we lifted the blankets we found out that there was not even a boxspring on the cement, just the mattress. We had read reviews that the beds were hard but didn't figure that they would be this hard. Overall the food and facalities were good and clean. Other than the few problems mentioned we had a good vacation. The staff were fairly friendly and accomodating. Anyone going there expecting all the perks of a 4 star resort is going to be very dissapointed. It is a 3 star resort, would make 4 stars if they did not try to nickel and dime everything.

The Viva Wyndham Maya is in the Playacar area and we chose this being 3 women travelling together believing it to be very central. Check in went very smoothly. Our room was simple and clean. We had a safe in the room, but unfortunately no fridge. However we were given lots of bottled water. The bathrooms do not have soap or shampoo, so come prepared. The evening we arrived it had been raining steady for several hours and rained into the night. The buffet (I thought) was 1st rate. Lots of choice and very good service. I have been to 7 all inclusives so am experienced in this. We ate one night at the italian restaurant and found it very nice. The banana crepe flambe is not to be missed. Get your reservations early on as we booked on Tuesday and could only get reservations for Saturday. The beach is 100 % beautiful. We were not bothered by vendors (but they were there if you wanted something). Lots of watersports equipment. Never a problem getting three chairs together even in the afternoon. We never made it to any of the shows unfortunately too tired after a long day, but heard they were very entertaining. The family pool is very nice. The adults only pool is brand new and not very big, but certainly away from all the hub bub. On the grounds they have a capybara (or paca) habitat so there are lots of them running around and they are really cute to watch. I did wonder about the price of tours. We went on a couple and I can't recall the price however we did hear that the tour desk at the resort sold the tours cheaper than the Sunquest Rep. The reason we were told is that the Sunquest tours are insured. Not sure what that meant. We overheard one couple complaining about the resort on the second day. Quite funny really. The noise (at 9:00 pm for about 20 minutes), the buffet, the temperature of the ocean! All in all for the price its a wonderful resort.

The humidity initially caught us off guard but by day three we were well accustomed to it and it didn't bother us. Our hotel room was your average room. The cleaning staff provided us with decorative towel art and did a good job of keeping our room clean. We hardly spent any time in it. No matter where you went there was always a cheery 'Hola' to greet you. We soon found out that a Mexican minute could be anywhere from 1 minute to whenever. You had to be careful and pinpoint an exact time. We didn't book any excursions through the hotel but the staff at the desk was always prepared to attempt to assist you. We found the food in the buffet to be fantastic. We stayed for two weeks and there was always something new to try.

At breakfast we found an array fruits, cereals, eggs - any style, potatoes, mexican styled breakfasts and more. Lunch time usually found us snacking at the pool side buffet bar. Here they served up a variety of foods such as pizza, hot dogs, ribs, the best hamburgers you can find, pasta, fries, salad, sandwiches, fruit, mexican meatballs, rice, and the list goes on. We never encountered a 'bird diving' problem with the food. The supper hour generally found us going to the buffet where once again we were royally treated to an array of fish, beef, pork, chicken, steak, potatoes, cheese, salads, pizza, pasta - cooked to your liking,soup, rice,fruit, breads and dessert. We soon found a favorite waiter 'Vincente'. We requested a soy sauce but due to our chopped up Spanish (okay we didn't have any) we ended up getting a whipped up batch of what we called Vincente's World Famous Salsa. Each day Vincente would treat us to another version of his specialty - kicked up a notch. The waiters were constantly refilling our glasses with whatever beverage we wanted - including wine. I have to say the Christmas Eve Buffet was a sight to behold. The tables were beautifully set. As you approached the buffet your jaw dropped as you found each watermelon art decoration. Whole melons were carved into such things as the Virgin Mary, stars, a pig and flowers. It was amazing. We were treated to huge prawns, fish, chicken, turkey and gravy the usual array of mexican foods, fruit, breads, pasta, potatoes, etc. We definitely didn't leave hungry. We ate at the two signature restaurants the Portifino and the Mexican Restaurant which you needed reservations for. When we ate at the Mexican Restaurant, it was still outside by the pool as the new facility wasn't completed (it was completed a few days later though). We found we really couldn't enjoy our meal fully even though it was good because of the cooler temperature and breeze that evening. We ate at the Portifino twice. The first time it was really good. We found you had to take advantage of the appetizers as the main course portions were somewhat on the small side. Service was great. We booked our Christmas meal at the Portifino and found it to be a little disappointing only in that we were told that the menu was going to be a 'special' menu for that day. It was the same limited menu and I guess this sort of tainted our opinion of that meal - no turkey. Our biggest frustration was trying to book at the sister resourt Viva Wyndham Azteca. We were told that we had privileges over at that resort as well but when it came down to it, we really didn't have many at all. For four days straight we went to the reservation desk to book a spot in one of their restaurants and were told that there were none available. Our hotel was only given so many spots and they filled up quickly, yet we would constantly see their guests frequenting our hotel, buffet, restaurants, pool, bar and participating in our recreational activities. We asked a few people why they were at our facility and their response was that it was more fun at our hotel and they could access anything they wanted at ours. Doesn't seem right does it? We spent hours and hours on the beach. I can't say enough about the staff working at the Viva Maya. From 9 in the morning until 1:15 the next morning they are hustling around that place making sure that everyone was having a good time. There is so much to do, if you want to participate. Volleyball, scuba, snorkeling,kayak, windsurfing,water polo, bocce ball, areobics, dance lessons, bingo, ping pong, treasure hunts, olympics, etc. These guys and girls are remarkable. No matter where you turned, to name a few, you would find Eric, Diana, Alberto, Julia, Raphael, Stephania, Alicia, Vrena, Edorado at the pool, Edoardo at the windsurfing - oh did I mention Edoardo at the windsurfing? Yum. These guys never forget your name. They participate with you and make you feel at home. They sit and eat with you, talk with you and make you feel like you are old friends. I was especially taken with how they mixed with the kids. There are a lot of kids going through that place and they remember each of their names - unbelievable. The kids club is more than just a babysitting club as my kids found out. They thought that they were going to be stuck in a room drawing pictures or something if they had to go there and thus they really didn't want to go. We left them there for a few hours one day and when we came back they had discovered that there was so much more to the Club. There was no sitting in a room at all. They were at the climbing wall, in the pool, playing soccer, bocce ball, bingo, sandcastles and more. They made a lot of good friends there and wanted to join in as much as possible after that. I would suggest that you introduce your children to the kid's club - none of you will regret it. The fun didn't end there. At 9 each night the children were all invited onto the stage to participate in mini disco. There was dancing and games of elimination and prizes awarded. The nightly entertainment was fantastic. The same staff mingling with you on the beach for hours before that transformed themselves into a well rehearsed group of performers. Some of the shows we were treated to were Grease, Chicago, Moulin Rouge, Michael Jackson, Cinderella, and Aladdin. What a treat - the costumes, backdrops and performances were great. Oh, yes - they tried really hard to each all of us the Viva song and dance. Well they tried. From here the adults were invited to the disco where dancing to the tunes generated by the themes of the evening were on the agenda. We were so tuckered by that time that unfortunately we didn't make it there often. The last night we were there there was a party on the beach. It was beautiful and all age groups could attend. Participation was the key to having a good time. The kids were invited to be entertainment one night. They took the kids and rehearsed with them for a couple of hours one day and at night they put on a wonderful show, complete with great costumes. If you weren't able to snap enough pictures yourself, don't worry, there are resident photographers roaming the area ready to take the ones you missed. They even bring their own props - an iguana, parrots, monkey...You can request special pictures be taken and of, course, you are not obligated to buy any of them. We did, and I'm sure the photographers can buy new lenses for the amount of pictures we bought. Well what more can I say. It was an emotional time having to leave this resort. We said our farewells. My youngest son crying as he hugged some of his favorite playmates (Edoardo the lifeguard at the pool and Eric).

The Viva Maya is one of the resorts on the ocean side, there are several resorts in Playacar that do not have direct access to the beach. You can stroll the entire length of the beach to the south, we didn't try going north. This was our 3rd trip to the area around Playa del Carmen, the 1st two we stayed closer to town (Gran Porto Real and Hotel Lunata). I would have preferred to stay in Playa del Carmen in a small hotel rather than an all inclusive but Expedia found us a great deal on a package at the Viva Maya, which had been recently reopened after repairing damage from both Emily and Wilma, cheaper than just the airfare alone. Room-above average-since the hotel had been recently renovated, the rooms were very clean and no signs at all of age, very spacious, our room had two double beds. Amenities included an iron, an in room safe, a small refrigerator and complimentary water which you could refill in the hall with filtered water. We had a TV but it had a faulty cable connection (which we called them on but they didn't fix) so I'm not sure what kind of stations it was supposed to get. The rooms are all angled so that every room has some sort of ocean view. Bathroom-excellent-big fluffy towels, a hair dryer, terrific water pressure and plenty of hot water. My only complaint here was that after the first day, they didn't replenish the toiletries, you shouldn't have to ask to have that done. Restaurants-average-there are two reservation only restaurants-one Mediterrenean, the other Mexican. We only ate at Portofino, the Mediterrenean one, the service was great, the food good but not terrific. You could also eat at the restaurants at the Viva Azteca, two resorts down but we didn't. The other option is the buffet restaurant, I liked the breakfasts with the made to order omelets, pancakes, fruit, cereal and most everything else I would think to eat for breakfast. Lunch was only so-so, a couple of times I grabbed only a bite and then we went off to town to eat. Dinner was hit or miss but we never had anything truly great. Beach-above average-big enough for a volleyball net and 5 or 6 rows of beach chairs. No umbrellas or palapas and the shade from the palm trees were wiped out by the hurricanes so there was no shade on the beach, not good for a pasty faced Chicagoan like me! Pool and activities-average-there is one pool and regularly scheduled activities during the day, there is a gym with good equipment and an onsite spa that we did not visit. They had bicycles that you could use to ride into town but they were of poor quality and not many of them. Non motorized sports are available along with instruction-catamarans, wind surfers, kayaks-and this is an excellent place to use them from as there is no reef and you can go pretty far out. Service-okay-although the personnel was extremely friendly and personable, several times we had to get drinks fixed, either too weak or strong, tour desk didn't know much about the surrounding area, we never got a requested wake up call, toiletries were not replaced, our TV wasn't fixed, our restaurant reservation was never registered. If I could give 3.5* I would but I feel 4* is too much as this is not what I would expect at a 4* resort.

The previous post forgot to mention Simone (Italian guy) and Nicolas at guest services (another good Canadian) as great people who make the stay absolutely enjoyable. We stayed at the Azteca a couple of years ago and the Maya is much better, less stuck up and more outgoing! The beach is absolutely beautiful, seems a lot bigger then on some pics I\u2019ve seen from June. There is a band of small (and sometimes not so small) rocks about 10 feet into the water (basically, where waves breaks) that last for about 5 feet before you return to all smooth sand. Water shoes solve that problem, but not a must. The vegetation is very well on its way, just a few palm tree tops to go. Other than that, you would not know anything ever blew by there! Don\u2019t be alarmed by the vegetation near the airport, the farther south you go the better, near Tulum it is barely noticeable. We did go to Xel-Ha and it is in perfect condition! Back at the hotel, touch ups are almost done on seaside units (I believe they are all time-share anyways). Construction is still going on on the new section in front of the hotel (close to street), and on the new Viva restaurant (just behind Portofino). The new hotel section does have a pool going up. Looks like all will be done in 1 month max. Construction is a non-issue noise or view wise. Food at the resort is all right, often looks better then it taste. Beef is always tough anywhere in Mexico it seems. We are picky eaters, but even at that, there is always something to please the stomach! (We heard of nobody ever getting sick) Servers are always so nice, especially Vincent! Mexico beds are always hard but the Maya now uses eggshell on the beds and that makes them very comfortable!

Yes...the buffet is varied...BUT - birds constantly dive-bomb the food and there is no air-con in the main All Inclusive Restaurant.

However, the wine comes out of taps near the other drinks...you're not officially supposed to get it yourself, but no-one seemed to notice when (tired of being ignored by the staff) we went to fill our glasses ourselves! Opposite the hotel is a small arcade of shops; all pricey. Playa del Carmen is about a 20 minute bike ride. The hotel hires bikes but they don't have brakes - you have to pedal backwards to stop, which is a bit disconcerting at first! August is incredibly humid - about 85% every day. It rained about 5 times during our stay - each time the rain was just refreshing, a welcome respite from the sun. And I love the heat; just not the kind of heavy humidity you get in the Yucatan in August. Other times of the year are probably OK. The ancient sites are fantastic but very exposed to the sun.

You could go for a late night swim, as long as you weren't disturbing anyone. There was alot of security, and they just wanted to make sure everyone had a safe time.

It is rated as a 4 star, but in Mexico you should always knock a star off to get a realistic American - European rating. In this review I am going to try and provide a fair portrayal of this hotel so you can ignore all the idiotic people that cry over the fact the maid didn't speak English or the desk clerk was blunt when there was a line of 10 other guest waiting behind them. Firstly the hotel staff here are quite friendly. They often appeared to be a little rushed, but at times you could tell they were multi-tasking when the hotel got busy. From the people who collect the towels at the beach to the hotel management, I was very impressed with the team the hotel had put together. The hotel is set in a mini rainforest setting, with shaded wooden walk ways leading you from building to building. The \"green areas\" had a multitude of flora and fauna as well as the odd iguana sunning itself in a tree. All rather cute. The hotel has 3 internal restaurants and over 400 guests. One restaurant is a buffet whose theme changes every night. During the month of July the hotel has a lot of Italian, German and Dutch guests (July is when the majority of these countries take a summer vacation) and thus the buffet contained a lot of pasta, pizza and breaded meats to cater to these groups. There were a couple of Mexican dishes here or there, but remember Mexican food to Europeans is like Indian (curry) food to Americans, not popular. The buffet however had a huge array of dishes and okay desserts and the quality of the food on the whole was average to very good. There are two restaurants (Mexican and Mediterranean/Seafood) in the hotel that you have to have a booking for. You need to make your reservations as early as possible as they both fill up fast. You probably won't get a table for the first few days when you arrive and will have to stick to the buffet. We never got to eat at either restaurant as \"Hurricane Emily\" spoiled those plans - but people we met had good things to say. There is also an Italian restaurant (Cafe Viva) owned by the Wyndam on 5th Avenue (a shopping street that starts off as quite upscale and as you walk down becomes a little more touristy, but all good fun) only a $5 cab ride away. You need to pay the hotel an additional $10 per person to eat there, but it is well worth it. The food was absolutley excellent as was the ambience, but the house wine was dreadful...stick to the cocktails. The hotel drinks were very good. Mexicans tend to have their frozen drinks a little on the watery side, so tell them you want it FROZEN and you'll get the drink prepared the way you know and love. The Margaritas however are not made using the typical brand mix used in the US, so they take a while to get used to. There is a range of alcohol behind both bars. If you want top shelf then you have to ask for it. If you tip $1 for every 2 drinks the waiters quickly learn your brand and you have no problem getting served. Look out for Petro at the pool bar, he treated us like royalty! The rooms are very basic, the air conditioners are noisy and the beds are like slabs of concrete, but they are clean and are a good size. This was the only downside to our vacation. The beach was the largest of the all the hotels on the strip, it was beautifully cleaned each day and there were plenty of beds. Expect to get up at 6am though to put a towel on bed under a parasol. Europeans are very good at doing this, and many Americans lost out. There is also a water sports desk for fishing and jet skiing etc right on the beach. Europeans have yet to figure out that Speedos are not cool, and there was the odd topless bather on the beach..all rather amusing than upsetting. The pool didn't fill up as quickly as the beach, but was clean as was the large jacuzzi. there is also a swim up bar. Entertainment - the hotel employs a mixture of entertainment staff from all over the world. During the day they go out of the way to be friendly and invite you to participate in many different sporting events. In the evening they put on cheesy shows, were they dance (particularly well) and lip-sink to popular artists, movie soundtracks and theater productions. I was crying laughing at the Grease production, but Moulin Rouge was rather good. The same staff also entertain the kids from morning to mid-night and the little ones seemed to be having a blast every time we saw them. Really great people on the whole. As a travel agent my wife and I got an incredible deal on the hotel for an all inclusive so we can't complain. If you are spending around $200 a night per room then you should be happy, except in my opinion about the hard beds. Playa del Carmen is much more relaxed than Cancun, but 5th Avenue provides plenty of fun in the evenings. If you want to go and explore a little, Alltoursnative was an excellent company to take an excursion with, they have catalogs you can browse through for ideas of snorkeling/ruin trips. We had to evacuate out early because of the hurricane and managed to get a flight out of Cancun but I would like to add that at all times the hotel staff acted professionally and worked as a unit to accommodate guests during a particular nervous time for all parties involved!", "Date": "July 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels", "Title": "\u201csimply the best !!!\u201d", "Author": "defcon31", "ReviewID": "UR3690714", "Content": "this resort even deserves more than 5 stars from us.

All of the staff members were more than happy to help us with anything we needed. As far as the food goes, I would consider myself a picky eater, and I loved everything I ate! We, myself and two friends, all ate like pigs every night. The buffet for breakfast and lunch stayed the same daily, and it was good, but we never ate their for dinner. We made reservations at the restaurants in the hotel- and every single one was excellent. Make sure and make reservations as soon as you get there, because they fill up fast. We even ate at the Azteca one night and were not disappointed. We didn't get sick at all due to the food or water. We were given bottled water to brush our teeth with, and soda and beer to drink in the mini-fridge was refilled daily. We didn't have any trouble getting a chair by the pool or the beach, and there was plenty of white sandy beach left to play beach volleyball or just walk along the beach. Some mosquitoes at night, but nothing crazy. The taxi service was safe and all fares were consistent. We didn't have any problems with any other guests from other countries or natives on our trip.

I must say, this website is extremely helpful when your unsure of where you should go and stay so I'm happy to include my opinion of the Viva Wyndham Maya. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. We had no problems checking in or out and on our last day when we had to check out early but didn't leave until later that evening, they were very accomodating letting us shower in the spa and locking up our luggage. The rooms were always clean, the ONLY complaint I would have was how loud the air conditioner was. WOW! If I hadn't brought my earplugs, I would have never gotten any sleep. My boyfriend didn't seem to mind, but I'm a light sleeper so it was pretty annoying. The food was really good. We've been to a few different countries (in all inclusive resorts) and it was definately much better than Cuba or the Dominican Republic. It was too bad we only had two dinners allowed for the \"a la carte\" restaurants but we took advantage of both nights and even tried out the Viva Wyndam Azteca and it was good. The best was the Viva Cafe in Playa del Carmen. Now that was a great meal!!! The beach was o.k. (Cuba is better). Sure the sand is phenomenal and the water is crystal clear but if your not up at 6am to save a seat since there are tons and tons of people, you won't get a great spot. It's not really something to complain about I guess but I just thought I'd share that little tidbit. It's very very crowded that's for sure. Since it was just my boyfriend and I, it was nice that this resort wasn't full of rowdy teenagers. There were lots of families and older couples (all of which didn't speak English) and couples our age as well. There's lots to see and do (but excursions are VERY expensive) so I would definately recommend Playa del Carmen as a hot vacation spot. As for staying at the Viva Wyndam Maya.....well, after walking on the beach and checking out a few of the other resorts (to the RIGHT only...none of the resorts to the left of us had ANY beach) I'd check on them too (sorry I can't remember the names) but all in all, if you ended up staying there, you'd be happy.

Everyone in our group of 8 agreed that this resort more than exceeded our expectations! Friendly, helpful staff, immaculate resort, great food and a postcard perfect beach! Stayed in room 2136 (adjoining 2134) in the Tulum section. We had a ground floor, very large terrace facing the grounds of the RIU Palace next door. This location was very private and quiet and provided a partial ocean-view! Our friends stayed across the hall and therefore had their terrace on the much busier pool-side. Both had their ups and downs but we would not hesitate to stay in either of these rooms on future visits. The location was very close to the beach and was, in fact, more convenient to return to the privacy of your room than use the beach/pool facilities, which was nice! My husband, myself and 2 of our children ate all of our meals at the buffet restaurant. We prefer this to spending our time doing the 2 hour a la carte dining thing. The buffet was always excellent! Lots of selection, very tasty, hot food hot, cold food cold, etc. Spent a week in Cancun in Feb. and would have preferred to starve than eat the food provided at our hotel! On the other hand, would have easily gained 10 lbs. at the Viva had we had no restraint!!! The others in our party chose the a la carte route and rated the Asian Rest. at sister hotel as so-so to good, Portofino very good and the Viva Cafe in Playa del Carmen as excellent ( $10.00 surcharge includes all drinks and a 3 course meal). Lots to do (or not) including tennis, archery, rock climbing wall, trapeze/trampoline, dance lessons, cocktail mixing (sampling!), volleyball, etc. Water sports incl. catamarans, boogie boards, kayaks, wind surfing and more. Seemed to have a very good kid's club at the resort although our 8 yr. old preferred to spend (ALL!!) his time with us on the beach or swimming in the pool! Take the complimentary bicycles to Playa but don't forget to take along the bike locks, as 5th Ave. is for walking only! Ferry boat to Cozumel cost $45 for 2 adults and 1 child. Took a horse-drawn carriage ride for $25. This was money well spent as we got to see much more of Cozumel (schools, City Hall, old churches, real neighborhoods, etc.) than we ever would have on foot! Incredible entertainment back at the resort! Each night around 9:30 the staff puts on a show at the outdoor theatre. We saw Aladdin, Stars, Grease (the BEST!!), Moulin Rouge and a Mexican/Mayan show. We were all blown away by the first-rate costumes, sound, lighting, etc. No need to ever leave the resort for good times! There is also a disco which has the neatest outdoor area with huge beds, lots of pillows, candles, etc. Our kids, aged 16, 18 and 19 had a blast there until 2 a.m. every night!! My husband and I never saw past midnight despite all our good intentions for at least 1 night of a good party!! Nice shopping plaza right across the street with reasonable pricing. HINT - if you want to take home a great souvenir there is a cart located by the resort's pool where you can purchase pottery pieces to paint. We bought 2 Mexican sculptures for $10.00 each for 2 of the kids to paint. What we didn't know was that, when they are done, the lady who runs this stand takes their pieces home, touches (fixes!) them up, adds detailing and applies a glazing. We could not believe our eyes when we picked them up the next day! Store quality!! Grandparents have a new treasure!! Last of all, but in my humble opinion, the most important piece of advice of all! GET UP EARLY (6:30 a.m. at the LATEST) and secure a shade palapa, lounge chairs WITH cushions and a little side table!! I cannot stress enough the difference it will make for your long, hot (37 deg.) days spent on the beach!! Saw lots of sad, sunburnt souls!! Keep your blue beach towels in your room for the night, as you will need these to put on your chairs (the international sign of TAKEN)! You can exchange for fresh ones when towel shack opens at 8 a.m. Trust me on this one!! Have a glorious holiday at the Viva Maya!! We are counting the months until we can return!!

You also get the services of the Viva Vacation club staff who are extraordinary.

They hosted a beachside welcome party with upscale drinks and delicious hors-d'oeuvres. They saw us off after checking out, and were always there if we needed anything. The rooms are not luxurious but they are always very clean, and aside from sleeping, we're not in the room that much anyway! The food is very good, especially the breakfast buffett. There are 3 restaurant options, one of which is in downtown Playa. You can also use all of the restaurants at the Viva Azteca, which is close by. There is always a nice mix of guests from the U.S., Canada, Europe and South America. We like the proximity to Playa del Carmen as it is only a short 10 minute, $5 cab ride.

Remember to make your reservations at check in--we were able to get into all restaurants, with the exception of the Asian restaurant at the Viva Azteca. Rooms and buildings were incredibly clean and our view was spectacular of the beach. I strongly recommend becoming a Wyndham by Request member, which gives you some extra perks, such as a welcome snack and drink. There are plenty of activities to be enjoyed by all. We rented a car for the day and drove to Xel-Ha and the ruins at Telum...a worthwhile trip with fun tubing down the river through the jungle and snorkling in a large lagoon. Also, went on the snorkling trip from the hotel. This was very convenient, but a little crowded on the reef. Still enjoyable as we saw a wide variety of coral and fish. Staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. Two things we'd do differently if we return: probably rent a car for the week. We were reluctant to do so with this being our first trip, but realize that driving around would not be difficult and would provide us with a little more mobility. We think the cost would have been the same to rent a car for the week as it was to rent it for one day, and pay our transfer fees from the airport. Also, convert US dollars to pesos before arriving. We were told that everyone happily takes dollars, which is true, but they give about a 10% weaker exchange rate than they should for ease of figuring when making a purchase.

Before I get into the details of our trip, I would say we had a wonderful vacation. We are not picky people so we came back satisifed. I did want to give a very candidate review, however, so everyone knows what to expect. My impression before leaving was the Viva Maya would be wonderful. I also had the impression there were some people who wrote reviews that were just plan whiners. Upon return, I would say the Viva Maya was okay, and there are some people who are whiners. The ideal vacation for our family (my husband, myself, my son 16, and my daughter 14) is sun, water and relaxation and we got all that we could take. I am, however, surprised that people commented this is a great place for teenage kids. The week we were there (3/9 - 3/16) seemed to be mostly retired people. I would also say the majority of people did not speak English. Ironically, that made the vacation more relaxing for me. I did, however, get tired of topless sunbathers and men in Speedos, but that's just part of the experience. The staff: Wonderful! Everyone we encountered was very friendly. If you are considering staying here BECOME A WYNDHAM BY REQUEST MEMBER. It is worth the few minutes, it's free and you seem to get extra attention. The room: A room similar to an average hotel in the states. Nothing special, but clean. Also, by becoming a Wyndam By Request member, you get robes, slippers, and our refrigerator was always stocked with Corona and soda. The pool area: Very clean. My husband is an early bird so we were able to get chairs the days we chose to sit by the pool. There were always a lot of activities going on if you chose to participate. The good news is there is no pressure if you chose not to. We really liked the pool area. The beach: Don't expect what you see in the pictures. It still has beautiful sand and of course the water is unbelievable, but it is not as big and flat due to unusually hard and high waves they've been receiving in the last few months (which did make for great body surfing). I would say the area where you can lay out is very crowded. Walking south of the Viva Maya, the beach got nicer. Going north got much worse. I was thinking we could walk the beach to Playa Del Carmen, but you cannot. I'm not sure if that has always been the case or only now do to the erosion. The food: I was disappointed. I love to eat. The breakfast buffet was good. The lunch buffet was fine. I was really disappointed in the dinner buffet. We made reservations at the Portofino and the La Scalla. The Portofino was okay and the La Scalla was great. The snack bar was okay. It was nice the kids could get something to eat whenever they wanted. The one item that really lacked in my book was the desserts. My family lives off of sweets (We're a cheap date). I think we spent $100 buying candy bars in drug store in the Plaza Playcar. If you are a snacker, bring some of your own food. All in all, this is a nice place to stay. I know some people felt they got a lot for their money. I felt we paid a lot to stay here, mostly due to it being all inclusive. Since the food was sub par in my book, I did not feel I got a great deal.

We had a 2, 4 & 6 year old in our party. Overall the resort, people and food are very good. I have read many reviews on this website and they differ from person to person. If you are expecting the Ritz Carlton then look elsewhere. If you are looking for a fun, clean resort with average food then book Viva Maya. The following is the breakdown of the resort and my opinions: Rooms: Simple and clean. We had an ocean view room (Room 2311) that looked out at the pool and the ocean. Please note that none of the rooms are directly oceanfront. Our balcony had two chairs with a small table to hold drinks. The room had no dresser only shelves to hold our clothes and a closet. Therefore, make sure you bring some extra hangers. On the other hand my parents room had a full dresser and a armoire. The bathroom is your typical bathroom with a full tub. My opinion is that we didn't book this trip to live in our room so it was adequate for us. Food: As for any buffet eventually you will get bored of it. For breakfast they had omelets & eggs cooked to order, bacon, pancakes, french toast, cereal, home fries, fresh fruit, juices, yogurt, etc. Lunch can be had near the pool or at the same location as breakfast (La Terazza). The pool-side lunch consisted of pasta, pizza (slightly under cooked but good), nachos, chicken, salad bar, fresh fruit, ice cream, hot dogs and hamburgers. At La Terazza there were more selections including fish, beef of some kind, pasta, salad bar, deserts, etc. In my opinion walk over to La Terazza for more selections at lunch. Dinner we ate at the buffet and at the specialty restaurants. The buffet had pretty much the same things as for lunch but with more vegetables, meats, etc. The specialty restaurants by far are the way to go. We ate at Portofino, La Scala and Viva Cafe. All three restaurants were very good and would be considered 4-5 star restaurants. The dinner buffet was good, no shrimp or lobsters but you get what you pay for. Pool/Beach: The pool and beach were great. The pool was clean and warm with a pool bar. You need to get a chair early for both the pool and beach since they all get taken pretty early. The beach has eroded and you need to walk down a slight incline to get to the water. There were papalas (straw umbrellas) all over the beach which was great for us with the kids. The other resorts to the left of Viva Maya had almost no beach and the five star Royal Hideaway was building a retaining wall about ten feet high which you needed to walk down a ramp to get to the beach. The resorts to the right of Viva Maya had more sand but their beach umbrellas were about 100 feet away from the water. Therefore, I think we had the best beach especially for kids. We were able to lay under the umbrellas and the kids can be playing near the water only 10 feet away. Entertainment: The staff at Viva Maya worked hard at trying to make sure everyone was having a good time. They had beach volleyball, water polo, water aerobics, salsa lessons, spanish lessons, etc. If you wanted they could keep you busy all day long. Our 4 year old went to the kids club and had a blast, she didn't want to leave. At night time 9:45 PM they would do a show. Overall the show was your typical high school play, good but I fell asleep more than once. Typically we ended the night by walking over to the bar towards the front of the resort and had a cappuccino or espresso. We have stayed at many hotels in the past and taken several cruises all of which were four to five stars. I would rate the Viva Maya a strong 3 1/2 star to 4-star resort, and will go back, maybe even next year.

Rooms: We had a king bed with a view of the pool/ocean. There really aren't rooms that are right on the ocean as the resort is positioned vertically to the water. The room was clean and the bathroom was spacious and nice. The shower was great with perfect water pressure and the water was always hot. We did sign up for \"wyndham by request\" which is a must! But make sure you email the resort to have your \"wbr\" number added to your reservation. This entitled us to robes,slippers,shampoos, lotions, etc.. and bottled waters and Corona's were stocked in our fridge daily. I heard that alot of people thought the beds were hard at the Maya. We found the bed and pillows to be just fine and slept well every night. Our AC was brand new as well and kept our room COLD- sometimes having to turn if off to warm up. Food: We were kind of dissapointed with the food. I would make your dinner reservations for the week as soon as you get there as they book up very fast. The buffet was best for breakfast. Omelettes, hashbrowns, bacon, pancakes- that sort of thing. For lunch we would usually eat down at the pool where they served hamburgers/hot dogs/ gaucamole and chips/tacos/frenchfries and even had an icecream machine. We ate at Portofino and thought it to be less than average. Did not bother to eat there again. Mexican night the food was awesome!!!!! We also went to the Viva Cafe downtown which also was very good. Tried to get into Bamboo at the Azteca but couldn't get a reservation. Drinks: Drinks were average. Drank alot of pina colada's, hurricanes, and of course tequila. They do have top shelf liqours but more of selection was offered at the lobby bar. We did bring insulated mugs which was nice because ice melts in 2 seconds down there. Also convenient when laying ocean side- not as many trips to the bars. Although some days waiters were down there taking orders which was nice. Depending on who made the drinks they could be pretty weak. But all you have do ask for more! All the bartenders at the MAYA were so much fun and remember what you like! Beach: Even though the beach is eroded it's still awesome. The water is so beautiful. We never had a problem finding chairs and never made it down there until around 10am. Yes, people do put thier towels down to save chairs at the crack of dawn but we didn't find it neccessary. Just make sure if can to grab a cushion for your lounger. Much more comfortable. Pool: I thought the pool was pretty small but still pretty. TONS of kids in the hottub all day long which really grossed me out. So I never really went into the hot tub. Swim up bar was really fun too. The pool bar pretty much closed at 5 which kind of sucks if your having a good time. But they start to transform the pool area for the Mexican restaurant then. If you want a chair at the pool you will have to get up early to save those. It's annoying though because most of the chairs have towels on them but no people!!! Overall the Maya was a good time. Go into Playa at night because there's not much going on at the Maya after the show. There's a disco there but no one goes to it- so it's really lame. Playa is full on fun bars and only a $4 cab ride from the Maya.

The beach is absolutely beautiful and excellently maintained (although, due to changes in the current, the staff tells us the beach used to be larger). The water was gorgeous and clear, and only on one very windy/wavy day were there bits of seaweed here and there. The grounds also are beautiful and kept very clean. Our group never had any problems getting a chair, and we also got a palapa quite often, but we weren't on the beach for the shade. The rooms are clean and serviceable, but they are not as luxurious as you might expect from a 4 star hotel in the US. The beds are somewhat hard, the pillows aren't great, and even though we were Wyndham by Request members, we didn't get any soaps or extra amenities (having read tripadvisor beforehand, however, we were prepared with our own soaps and toiletries). That said, the rooms were kept very clean and well maintained, and we always had plenty of fresh towels (with different towel animals made for us by the great housekeeping staff). The food at the restaurants where you need reservations was very good. The food at the buffet was not very good, but there was an enormous variety of it, and the table drink service was excellent. We could usually find something decent to eat at the buffet, but it took some trial and error. But again, we didn't go to Mexico for the food, we came to soak the environment up and relax. (Also, as I'll note later, the food for our private wedding dinner was excellent.) The food at the snack bar by the beach was iffy - the burgers, hot dogs, and hush puppies were not so good, but there were also some really delicious roast chicken and flautas, and really delicous hot, salty french fries. The snack bar is probably a better bet for lunches than the buffet, if you choose your items wisely. The alcoholic drinks usually tasted watered down, but they were free, so if you wanted another, it was prompt in coming. Every so often, we got a really great margarita, and all was well in our world. The service everywhere we went was excellent, even though sometimes language difficulties made the interactions take longer than they might have otherwise. Everyone at the resort really tries to provide the guests with great service and a fabulous experience. When checking in, tired from our travels, we were given welcome fancy fruit drinks, and it definitely perked all of us up. Our wedding at the resort was wonderful (we chose Package #3, if you navigate to that section of the Viva Wyndham Maya website from the Wyndham homepage). Miguel, the wedding coordinator, does a fabulous job arranging all the flowers, decorations, dinner, music, legal documents, and other practicalities. We only had to spend about an hour when we first arrived going over the details and looking at the ceremony site, and then we only had to spend about 10 minutes at the doctor's office getting our blood tests taken care of. Everything for our wedding ceremony went very smoothly, and looked absolutely beautiful. Our private dinner after the ceremony was delicious, and the service was phenomenal. It was exactly what we wanted - something with extremely little fuss that was just a very happy and relaxed time for everyone. (Only FYI - although the area on the beach where we had our wedding was sectioned-off, some beachgoers got very close with their cameras - even one guy in a Speedo during the middle of our ceremony! However, most people were very respectful while watching. So long as you don't mind an audience - and the occasional clueless person who gets a little too close for politeness during the ceremony - a wedding on the beach is a beautiful experience.) We arranged for our group of 18 people to stay at the Viva Wyndham Maya through the Wyndham Group Sales department directly, which I highly recommend. We all got rooms near each other, and the process was relatively hassle free. Note, however, that you need to pre-pay for your entire stay about a month before you go if you work through the Group Sales office (I hadn't been aware of this before). All in all, my whole group really enjoyed our stay at the Maya, and my husband and I really loved our wedding. We chose the Maya for its location and reasonable prices, and we were very happy with our choice. If my husband and I were to go back to Playa del Carmen, we might stay somewhere else that's a little pricier in the hopes of encountering better food, but you really can't beat the beach or the service at the Maya. And for a no-fuss, all-inclusive, extremely chill beach wedding, I highly recommend the Maya.", "Date": "March 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "MA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Relaxing Spot!\u201d", "Author": "Italia46", "ReviewID": "UR3236977", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Viva for a week Feb. 20-Feb 27th.

We had two double beds, a good sized desk, a fridge, a big closet, and a good sized bathroom. The water pressure was amazing. The staff that cleaned our room did a great job. They even turned the bed down one night and left chocolates on the pillow. The beach was beautiful. I feel bad because the sand is washing away but the Viva was one of the best beaches in the area. We never had a problem finding a lounge and the towels were plentiful. There were many activities if you chose to partake in them. We just wanted to relax and were not pushed into doing anything else. We ate in all of the restaurants they have to offer. We suggest that you make reservations the first day. We only ate dinner at the buffet twice in a week. The buffet had a lot of different foods so we always found something. The desserts looked great but weren't very sweet. The shopping was good too. You could take a cab to town for 4 dollars or walk to the little shopping plaza across the street from the resort. We thought the Viva was great and would recommend it to anyone who asks. I do suggest for anyone staying there to take a minute and sign up for a Viva by Request Card on the website. It helps you to get a better room and they even put snacks and drinks in your room when you arrive.", "Date": "February 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "olympia, wa", "Title": "\u201cgreat but watch your credit card\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3232175", "Content": "We stayed at the Viva Maya from December13-26th. We booked online and became a wydham member for free. Upon arrival we were greeted by friendly hostesses, and then we were escorted to our room, which overlooked the ocean. In our room we had fruit and wine waiting for us compliments of being a wyndham member. Our ocean view room we were staying in was reserved specifically for wyndham members. So it does pay to be a wyndham member. We paid 173.00 per night, that with a gov't discount and 193.00 from December 24-26. Very reasonable price considering that was for 2 adults and 1 child who is 9 years old. The hotel was clean, the service was great, the food was great, really no complaints at all. I did a lot of research before going to Cancun and before booking at this hotel. I am surprised that noone has written about credit card fraud. We only used our credit card at the hotel; the spa, car rental and at checking out. Two months later we get a call from our bank saying that a $1900.00 USD purchase is trying to go through on our visa from Mexico. It was not surprising to me considering all receipts from Mexico contained all 16 digits of your credit card number plus your expiration date and name etc. Whoever was using our credit card in Mexico actually managed to make it into a plastic card. My sister, who also travelled with us and stayed at the Viva Maya, had the same incident happen to them. A $5000.00 purchase tried to go through on her Visa two after they returned home from Mexico.

After all we came back a second time...WE stayed at Viva Feb-3-10th 2005. It was our 2nd time here..also staying 3 yrs ago. One of the biggest changes that took place at this resort was the beach..it has eroded something terrible compared to 3 yrs ago.. But still the ocean was beautiful and pure sand..no coral or rocks to walk on. We thought it was really crowded where all the chairs are now..due to a good 30-40 feet of missing beach...this just completely shocked us..So now all the chairs are jammed packed together..and its hard to get around..Too many palapas too close together and some way to low to the ground..while we were there 3 of them had to be dug up and moved..due to the beach washing away..very sad...if they dont do something soon they will have no beach left at all. The food seemed to have gone downhill from last time we were there(the buffett) although I survived and always found enough to eat....I believe they cater too much to the Europeans(food choice wise)..who YES are rude people.. Definitely pay the $10. per person and go to town and eat at Viva Cafe..you can eat there as many times as you wish..$10..per time though..If you walk from the resort..it is fairly far..we walked to town many times..but then the cafe is quite a ways down..so be prepared for the walk..wear the right shoes..and go completely starving..as they feed you so much food..and its excellent food.. We also ate at the portofino restaurant which we enjoyed too.(eat here if you like to be waited on) One of the worst things we had to witness ..was Italians letting their child pee and poop right on the beach..she was old enough and potty trained..good grief..that disgusted us..pretty much got up and left..after I voiced my opinion about that in a very loud voice...unfortunaltely we were surrounded by foreigners..so I wasnt understood..:( hundreds of people walk the beach barefoot...yuck! obviously they do this at home?????? If you are wishing to socialize with Americans who speak English and make new friends..Dont stay here..I would say 80% Europeans.. Our room was wonderful..we even had bathrobes and slippers provided..no complaints on the room at all. I think it was a newer one..

If you dont want a maid coming to your room make sure you put the sign outside your door..as they come to your room more than once a day.. oh and if your a snacker ...bring your own..their snacks are way too expensive..re: candy..chips..

Aruba is a desert island, great for nightlife, St Lucia was the most beautiful, like a jungle; but you couldn't leave the resort. Antigua was my favorite until here. THIS WAS THE BEST OVERALL TRIP I HAVE BEEN ON!!! The food was excellent. People complain about the buffet???? We only ate there 2x. You just need to plan ahead and make reservations at the other restuarants. Portifino was excellent, as well as the restaurant downtown. You could even get something to eat at 2am! The beach was one of the best I have been to. The staff could not have more helpful. there are SO MANY activities to do; or if you like, just say \"no thank you\" and lounge around. Drinks were the same as any all-inclusive resort I have been to. HIGHLY recommend a trip to Xel-Ha. This is were they filmed the Blue Lagoon. Great for snorkeling and swimming. My wife and I went on an ocean \"walk\". She would never Scuba, but loved it!! In town there is a restuarant that is in a actual cave. Great place to have a drink. Also, Casa del Carmen downtown is a nice spot to meet some locals. day trip to cancun was fun also. We just ABSOLUTELY had the best trip. My wife used to be a travel agent, and has been all over.

We are a family of four (kids aged 11 & 12), who have never gone away on a family holiday in the winter before. We left -32 to go to +32. We stayed a week at the Viva (Jan. 6- 13). It was the best week of our lives. This resort is rated a ***+, so if you are expecting anything more than that, DON'T STAY THERE. The beach, pool and grounds were top notch. The beach is washed away a little but nothing major. Tons of chairs to be found on the beach, never had a problem getting a place to sit for the day. The pool area is great. Lots of activities around that area. Food and drinks couldn't have been any better. Remember when going to a resort, expect buffets. You will be sick of them when you go home, but you were fed well while there. The drinks maybe were a little weak, but do you really want a place full of falling down drunks? Just ask the guys at the bar to pour you triples, they will, if you ask. The rooms are very clean. You will need to bring your own toiletries, and there is not a fridge in every room. We didn't have one, and had no use for one. The resort staff is great, but the animation staff is fabulous (you know who you are, Elody, Simona, Alisia & Erick). Our kids were kept busy with tennis, bocce ball, bike riding, rock climbing, ping pong, water aerobics, performing on stage, etc. Yes, things are repeated in 3 or 4 different languages, but isn't that catering to your guests??? I won't go into details about Playa del Carmen or the excursions, as this is comments about the resort. My final comments are......if you are a family of four, this is a perfect place for you and your budget. Just remember you are going to Mexico, and to just be there in the dead of winter, makes everything worthwhile.

Upon arrival, there was some confusion with the rooms. I was given the key to occupied rooms twice and sent to a room that only had one bed when I specifically reserved a room with 2 beds for the 2 people (strangers) who would be occupying the room together. The 4th room turned out to be OK with a nice patio that overlooked the garden and pool area. It was good for a senior who couldn't walk too far, it was close to the food/bar area, tables and chairs with umbrellas, beach and the Portifino restaurant. Rm 2131. My room was good, it was clean, bright newly painted and smelled good. The small patio faced the next resort so it wasn't great to sit and look at anything but I don't do much of that anyway. I enjoy the beach etc. I also had easy access to the same amenities as the last room I described even though it was in the other building. Room 1137. The other senior in our party had an accessible room with a wider doorway, walk-in shower and a large patio. It was clean, no bad odour and not too far from the buffet restaurant and lobby.Rm 1157. None of our party had a room with any odour that I had read about in this forum. The AC is loud but not a problem for any of us. The food was good and no-one got sick. There was a good variety at the buffet and if you chose wisely you didn't have to repeat your meals at all. The Mexican restaurant is outside beside the bar and pool area and was cool at night. Take a sweater and long pants in case! Our Wedding Dinner was held there and the personalized service was great and made it a memorable Mexican Wedding! The Viva Cafe in Playa Del Carmen was excellent for food and atmosphere. The staff was great!!They made a real fuss over the bride and groom to be and made a big production when serving them \"shooters\". They even offered them to the 2 Mothers to try with the same production. The price has gone up to $10 each as a surcharge, but well worth the price and the $5 taxi from the resort. We received a bottle of water everyday and if you wanted more you could refill it at any bar and several of the hallways had water coolers in them to refill your own bottle. Also not a problem with anyone. The activation team is wonderful, very friendly but not pushey for you to participate in activities. They come around and tell you what is happening and you can decide if you wish to participate. The nightly shows are fantastic, the costumes spectacular and the dancing very good. The young people work very hard to put on a good show. The resort seemed to have a good kid's program as they also put on a show before the real entertainment and I was always surprised to see so many kids that I had not seen during the day. The drinks were good and plentiful. They seemed to be a little weak as I never felt \"tipsy\" after trying quite a few. You could ask for more strength if you wished. We never had a problem with finding a chaise at the beach . They were plentiful and both sun and shade was available. Lots of beach activities, water sports, boogie boards, kayaks, sail boats etc. I have read complaints about \"red flag \" days and no water sport available but that is hardly the fault of the resort, they are only being cautious and advising people that the water is rough and possibly dangerous. Day trips are available from the resort and the prices are comparable as far as I could see. Some of our party went to Chitchen Itza and found the drive very long, some went to Xel Ha and thoroughly enjoyed the day. Not such a long drive. I went swimming with dolphins at Puerto Adventuras and had a blast!! An awesome experience and only a couple of hours so still time to do other things that day. There is a small mall across the street for gift shopping and Playa Del Carmen is a half hour stroll or a $5 taxi ride away. Taxis are plentiful and punctual. Just ask the bellhop to get you one. In spite of the few room problems at the beginning, the staff tried to fix everything as soon as possible and upgraded my daughter and her fiance to the Presidential Suite after the first day. What an awesome perk!! My husband and I have been to a number of all inclusive resorts in Mexico, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, St Martaan and condos in Hawaii and we enjoyed this resort as much as any, if not better.

We have travelled to Cuba , Cozumel and have stayed at the Iberostar Tucan/Quetzel, before. We bought this vacation as a sell-off. If we had paid full price we would have been disappointed. We travelled from Jan.04 to 11th. The reason we would have been disappointed with the Viva is because of the actual property. It is very nice but it is a little small compared to the places we have stayed before. We were in a room closest to the lobby and furthest from then beach and it still just took 2 mins to get to the beach. BEACH:The beach was very nice and clean but beach lovers beware-a lot of the beach has been washed away and the hotels to the North of the Viva Maya, including the Viva Aztec basically have no beach. If I had been staying at one of these places I would have cried upon arrival because of the lack of beach. During the week that we were at the Viva there were Red Flags everyday, so no watersports. ROOM: We had a room that had a \"garden view\", which is no view at all, just of an alley. I would try to get a pool view room or ocean view. Rooms were very clean. We had a fridge in the room which was never filled with anything. We were onlygiven 1 bottle of water/day, which is not enough. FOOD: Food was great, we liked it better than the Iberostar. The Portofino was the best a la carte. The Japanese at the Aztec was very good as well. ENTERTAINMENT: The entertainment was the best that I have ever seen at a resort! All the performers were (seemed like) professional dancers. It was like going to see a show at a theatre or auditorium at home for which you would pay at least $50.00 to see. We were very impressed with the nightly entertainment. STAFF: The staff for the most part were very helpful. Upon arrival a bell-hop delivered our luggage to our room. He noticed our AC was pretty loud so he sent someone right away to come and fix it. Within 30mins a maintainance man came and replaced our AC. One of the guys (Cornelio)at the restaurant reservation desk was pretty rude all the time. He just did not seem to care about anything. It was my husbands birthday while we were there and I asked the front desk if they did anything special for birthdays, they referred me to Cornelio, who told me they did a little cake. He did not bother to ask me if I wanted the cake or not he just started chatting with his co-worker. It turns out for birthdays you can buy a tiny cake for $15USD or a $20 bottle of champagne. Don't expect anything else for birthdays. KIDS CLUB-looked great, if I had kids I would definitely go here with them. While we were at the Viva I would say there were mostly Europeans, so we did not get a chance to talk much to other people. We did take the Viva Jeep excursion which was very good and since we took the English tour we met others from the hotel who we could talk to.

Rooms: We had a great location with a large deck overlooking the ocean. While I did not see the inside of the \"Garden View\" rooms, I can tell you that they were entirely in the shade and as such looked to me as though they would be terribly dark and claustrophobic inside. Our room was clean and well kept, and the staff kept the fridge stocked for the most part. 2. Food: Mediocre overall. Maya claims to have 3 restaurants but I would add some caveats to that. There is the buffet, a real sit down restaurant called \"Portofino\" and the bar near the pool which is converted to a \"restaurant\" at dinner time. They also have a deal with a place in Playa del Carmen, but if you make the effort to go into town you would want to eat someplace better. The buffet ranged from good to poor with breakfast meals the best and dinner the worst. All the buffet food tastes the same after a few meals. Portofino was nice enough but they rush you in and out of there as if it were a speed-eating contest. Also worth noting - getting reservations (i.e., to eat anywhere other than the buffet) is difficult so best to call at least 2 days in advance. All in all, if you are expecting great cuisine you will be sorely disappointed. 3. Drinks: As expected plentiful. Good bartenders who use quality liquors. However, for whatever reason I found the mix drinks to be mediocre. Beer is \"XX\" and only available on tap. Its not great but its drinkable. All in all, bar service is pretty good. 4. Beach / Pool: Both were very good. Note that Viva Maya claims to have \"3\" pools but in reality it is one large pool that has 3 parts to it. As you might expect, there is a shortage of pool-chairs and despite signs to the contrary people are out at the crack of dawn to \"reserve\" chairs by leaving towels on them. The beach was great with plenty of chairs and a mix of sun/shade spots. 5. Activities / Facilities: Very good. Non-inclusive scuba on site with local diving (non-reef, however), included bikes, kayaks, sailing, etc. are all available and you can book pretty much any excursion imaginable (scuba trips to Cozumel, deep sea fishing, Myan ruins, etc) through the hotel. 6. Location - Good. If you want to venture off the property, the town of Playa del Carmen and the ferry to Cozumel are both within about a 30 minute walk or a $5 cab ride 7. Staff: Friendly and helpful although as you may expect there are certainly some challenges communicating as many of the staff speak little or no English (which is not a criticism incidentally - if you have a problem with Spanish don't go to Mexico!) Parting remarks: My first and probably last experience with an all-inclusive. Convenient if you have a big family and certainly if you have children, but I did not care for the \"summer camp\" atmosphere myself. If all-inclusive resorts are your thing, then you could do worse than the Wyndam Maya.", "Date": "January 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cHave a good time?

It was a great experience for our entire group, which included five adults and one 11-year old girl. We hope to go back next holiday season. Reservations: We booked directly through the Wyndham web site and got a very good rate (this web rate did require that we pay in advance). Make sure you join their free \"Wyndham by Request\" program (it has lots of benefits, as you'll see later). Ground transportation: As far as I could tell, the \"Green Line\" has a monopoly on ground transportation out of Cancun airport. Several people will try to sell you a transportation voucher, but I think they're all selling the same thing. I paid US$18.00 for a shared ride to the hotel and had to wait 45 minutes. My sister and her family purchased a voucher for a private taxi and still had to wait 30 minutes for a taxi to become available. Rooms: Being part of \"Wyndham by Request\" got me an upgraded room with a balcony, as well as a welcome basket (there is also a special check-in line for Wyndham by Request, which could come in quite handy if reception were busy). My room had a small refrigerator (the size of a dorm refrigerator) which they kept stocked with bottled water, soft drinks, and beer. Upon my arrival, the bathroom was well stocked with soap, shampoo, conditioner, shower cap, lotion, etc (though these were not regularly re-stocked). The bathroom was big and had a generous sized tub/shower (unlike the small showers I have had at many resorts in Mexico). My room was more than big enough for two full sized beds and a television - mostly spanish language stations, although CNN was in English as well as several movies on TNT, which had spanish sub-titles. \"ESPN Deportes\" carried Sunday/Monday night football. The maid service was fantastic, always keeping the room clean and stocked with fresh towels. The pillows in my room were great (maybe it was the upgradedroom). I should note that others who purchased their vacations through Apple Vacations or other consolidators had rooms that were not as nice: no complimentary soap/shampoos, no balcony, no small refrigerator, etc. If you are considering booking through a consolidator, make sure you are getting a much better rate than booking through the Wyndham web site. Resort: The resort is very compact, which is nice for getting around and also for staying in touch with family members. We had brought walkie-talkies along to keep in touch, but never used them. My room was a very short walk to the pool, which was just steps from the sand volleyball court, which was a frisbee toss to the ocean. Still, I never felt that it was over-crowded, even though we were there during peak season. The pool wasn't really that big, but it had several different areas for playing or wading and a large hot tub. The ocean was aqua blue and fairly warm. Many people spent long periods just playing in the waves. You could also take out a sail boat or a wind surfer for free. Snorkeling and motorized water sports were available for an additional charge. Internet access (US$2.00 for 20 minutes), tennis courts, and a workout area (weights and aerobic) were at the other end of the resort (a short walk from the pool, near reception). Every part of the resort was kept meticulously clean while we were there. Guests: The U.S., Europe, and Canada were all well represented the week we were there. Almost without exception, the people we met were gracious and fun. There were a lot of families (and extended families), which is what one would expect over X-Mas. Activities: There was always something going on at the resort. Sand volleyball (organized twice a day and ad hoc the rest of the time), stretching, water aerobics, bingo, spanish lessons, dance lessons (a different dance every day: merengue, salsa, etc), wind surfing lessons, beach games, tournaments, and water polo were all part of the daily routine. Of course, laying by the pool or on the beach were also popular activities. Make sure to try the swim up bar when you really want to cool down. Restaurants: We liked La Terraza (the main dining hall/buffet) for breakfast, where made to order omellettes were available every day. For lunch, we often ate the fast food available by the pool, although sometimes we went to the buffet for a better selection. For dinner, our group preferred one of the sit down restaurants. Portofino is the Italian/Meditaranean restaurant at Viva Maya and our favorite on the property. It is available for no extra charge, but you must book early. We had heard mixed reviews on the Mexican restaurant by the pool, but had a good experience the one night we ate there (again, no extra charge). Our favorite dinner was at the Viva Cafe in downtown Playa del Carmen, which is available for a surcharge (US$10.00/person as of our visit). The menu is Italian/Meditaranean and the food was excellent. You also have access to the restaurants at nearby Viva Azteca, although we never took advantage of this. Again, make sure you book any of the sit down restaurants ahead of time. Kids' Club: The youngest member of our party was 11-years old and too old for Club Vivita. Still, she had no trouble making friends her age or finding activites to participate in. Club Vivita had daily activities and the kids seemed to be having fun. Laundry: There is no self-service laundry available on the property. The resort offers a laundry service, although the prices were quite expensive (generally US$1.00-$2.50 per piece of clothing). I saw a few \"lavandarias\" in Playa del Carmen, but did not use their services. Viva Shop: There is a small store on-site for anything you might have forgotten. There is also some shopping across the street from the resort, if you don't feel like going into town. Playa del Carmen: I went to town three times during my stay. There is extensive shopping, although the stores tend to have the same items and the prices were not as good as I thought they would be. Still, walking up and down \"the avenida\" is fun and gives you a little local flavor. It is a long walk or a short taxi (US$4.00) to the downtown area . If you take a taxi, I suggest you ask to be dropped off near the avenida. I don't know anyone who took a bicycle (available at the resort free of charge) into town, but that would seem to be a viable option. Overall: Everyone in our group agreed this was the best holiday vacation we've ever had - much more fun than the carribean cruise we took the previous year. There have been some reviews critical of this resort lately, but EVERYONE we talked to was having the time of their lives. I'm not saying that Viva Maya is the Four Seasons - it's not. But if you are looking for a clean room at a nice resort with lots of activities, Viva Maya is your place. Again, if you are considering booking through a consolidator, look at the price offered by Wyndham on their web site. You will definitely get better treatment if you book direct and are a member of \"Wyndham by Request.\"", "Date": "January 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lansing, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay Over Christmas\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2998698", "Content": "Our family of 6 greatly enjoyed our stay at Viva Maya over the Christmas holiday. From grandparents to pre-teen, there were lots of fun things to do. Volleyball was our favorite, but we also participated in sailing, water polo, body surfing, tennis, dance lessons, morning stretch, pilates, bocce ball and more. On Christmas morning, all guests were encouraged to gather on the beach. Santa arrived spectacularly by parachute at a beach landing area - then passed out presents to all the children as pictures were taken. The Portofino restaurant offered elegant meals as did the Viva Cafe downtown which we took advantage of twice (Note: the appetizer alone was equivalent to a main course - you won't go away hungry. My second time there, I ordered an appetizer and asked that it be brought as my main course). We didn't go to La Scala at the Azteca - but other guests gave it high marks. We ate at the Mexican restaurant on site one evening and enjoyed the meal - although it gets cool in the evening this time of year and there aren't heaters to keep you warm. Our room was quite nice. Nothing fancy - maybe even a little spartan - but very clean with all the little niceties we have come to expect at a good hotel. Our room included robes, a full complement of bar soaps, shampoo, conditioner, hair blower, shower cap and refrig that was restocked daily. However, we did book one of the more expensive rooms (balcony/ocean view). Also, we spoke to other guests who didn't find the same \"extras\" (like shampoo and bar soap) we did. Evening entertainment was offered by staff who have daytime jobs too - the equivalent of good high school theatre. Mostly dance routines and lip sync. The Christmas eve show involved all the children who wanted to participate. Costumes were spectacular and the kids did a great job -- thanks to some skilled work by the staff in organizing the dance routines involving the children. We enjoyed this show best of all. We didn't do any tours offsite - but other guests who did gave positive reports. On the way home, all agreed we should do this again next Christmas. So, agree not to exchange presents, skip out on all the obligatory social events back home, avoid cooking - and, instead budget a trip to Viva Maya over Christmas.

We go on 1 or 2 all inclusive trips per year and really enjoyed the Viva Maya. Knowing the ropes for an all inclusive do really seem to help at this resort in particular. I took the advise of other peoples comments and signed up online for Wyndham by Request (my understanding is that if you did a package or were there on a time share this did not gain you anything extra). In fact we met friends there who were using their timeshare and when I said we got our room cleaned twice a day, candy and turndown service, beer, pop and water in our fridge as well as a bucket of ice in the room her comment was \"I don't know what hotel you're staying at but it's not the same on as us\". So there seemed to be some different levels of ammenities as we did get an alarm clock in our room and shampoo, conditioner and all that stuff. Now for comments on the resort itself! Beach - The beach was excellent, this was one of the main reasons we chose this resort and were not disappointed. Loved the fact that they had a waiter (David) for the beach who came down there and took drink orders. He was a very polite gentleman and made sure to tip him as he was always cleaning up cups and dishes and trying to get drinks for all those who wanted them! Food - Mainly ate lunch at the snack bar as it was most convenient to the beach and the pool and found the food there to be good. As we had joined Wyndham by request I had prebooked the a la carte restaurants in advance by emailing Areley Lopez the dates, times and restaurants of our choice. This was something I really liked as I tire of buffets very quickly and there was no limit on how many times you could eat at eat restaurant. Most resorts I've been to limit you to once or twice even some of the 5 star places do this! Our favorite was the Viva Cafe in Playa del Carmen ($5 per person extra plus taxi) and thanks to whoever suggested the Spegetti Carbonara and the chocolate mouse!!! We also enjoyed the Portofino especially the Mayan Coffee! Did also eat at La Scala and the Bamboo over at the Azteca which also were good. Activites - Spent some time over at the Azteca it is smaller and quieter more suited for couples than families due to the lack of activities. The activity people did a great job of getting people to participate and the evening shows they performed in we very entertaining. Shopping - There is a good shopping mall across the street from the Viva Maya and it has an ATM there. Only a 4 or 5 dollar taxi ride into Playa for more shopping or nightlife. Money exchange houses in Playa offered good exchange rate on the Canadian dollar. Was good to be so close! Rooms - The rooms were average which is what we expected. Nothing fancy but clean and adequate. If you got the ones to the back of the hotel there really is nothing for a view. Upon arrival we were taken by Nicholas from guest services to our room. When I told him it was not what we had requested via email he had us moved in less than 15 minutes which impressed me to no end as this is a first. As per some advise from this site I requested 3rd floor Coba building and had a good view and was close to the beach and pool! And again as we had joined the Wyndham by Request program there was cold Coronas (in bottles) in a bucket of ice, a hellium balloon, a chocolate bar and stocked fridge in our room when we arrived (nice touch considering there's no charge to join this program). Tours- Did book some tours through the hotel tour desk and they found tours the suited our group. They booked our group which ended up being over 20 people a couple of private snorkel trips that were great, especially the catamaran trip. Also did also just take a taxi and go the Xel ha (about $30 each way). Went on a Tuesday and were told this was the best day as only about 1/2 the number of people due to there being no cruise ships in port that day. Left the hotel at 8:30 am so were some of the first in the Lagoon. This was my 3rd time to Xel Ha and each time if just gets better and better. We never left the park till it closed and then there's a line of taxi's at the exit just waiting to take you back to your hotel. It's best to do the all inclusive as then you get towels, lockers, snorkel gear, life jackets, food, beaverages including alcohol and bottled water, ice cream and such! It's just an amazing place and we look forward to going back again and again. Also did Xcaret but no comparison to Xel Ha and in the end a lot more expensive. This resort is an excellent choice for a family vacation as it is small enough that you can relax and keep track of your family at all times. If have been to resorts that are of a higher star rating than the Viva Maya and not been as impressed as we were here! We would definetly go back. Work with the people at Guest Services and they will help make your stay even better, they are very helpful!

In any case, we couldn't use this coupon at the Iberostar so we chose the Viva.

The first big key that's an absolute must: Join the Wyndham By-Request program on the Wyndham website. It's free and unlike airline loyalty programs, you are rewarded instantly for signing up with this one. We got a great webrate -- $153 a night, all-inclusive, for my wife and me, thanks to ByRequest membership. It also got us an automatic upgrade when we got there. We paid for garden view and got beach view, very near the pool. We also got beer, soft drinks and water in our mini-fridge and a free hour of internet. We also got to make our dinner reservations for the full stay the day we arrived, which got us where we wanted, when we wanted. What a deal for nothing! We also got a different-colored wrist band than other guests. Not sure it did us any more good, but I did notice. The food at the buffet is best at breakfast, and we made this our primary daytime meal. Breakfast runs until 11:00, so we'd go about 10:00. I was into the custom-made omelets while my wife loved the French toast and pancakes. There's also scrambled eggs, bacon, fruit, hashbrowns, toast and other rolls every day. Lunch and dinner aren't the world's best, but we never left hungry. Plus, with the big breakfast, we often skipped the lunch buffet and just went to the snack bar by the pool, where there are decent burgers, fair pizza, hot dogs, french fries and soft-serve ice cream ... plus fruit. The big key here is to not do the dinner buffet all nights. (Our favorite thing when we did was the pasta cooked al dente, with good, light, homemade marinara sauce and grated parmesan.) Instead, make reservations at Portofino on-site and at the Viva Cafe in town. The Mexican restaurant at Viva Maya is only OK and isn't really a restaurant, per se, but rather is just the pool bar area set up for dinner. Portofino is air-conditioned and the food was great. Viva Cafe is absolutely fantastic. It costs $5 a person extra (about $4 for the cab ride into town, each way) and you get a choice of three courses. It's an Italian spot. We loved the spaghetti carbonara, the gnocchi, the mushroom risotto and the creme brulee. The red wine flowed freely and we even got tequila shots at the end of the meal. It was our wedding anniversary and the staff drizzled the words \"happy anniversary\" on our dessert plates in a strawberry sauce. There are two restaurants you can also reserve at the Viva Wyndham Azteca, which is three resorts down and about a 10-minute walk. We didn't try them but heard good things. The beach is beautiful and amazingly well-kempt. Each morning workers are out raking and picking up any vegetation that might have washed up. The pool is large and fun, with a swim-up beach bar that ends up being a great socializing spot in the afternoons. The bartenders are all nice and quickly learn what you want. For me, it was two beers at a time. (The glasses are sort of small!) Dos Equis (XX) lager on tap is the only beer choice, but I buy it in the U.S. and was happy with it. There is plenty of top-shelf alcohol, including Appleton rum and the best Bacardi Anejo rum. Jim Beam is the bourbon of choice. We really enjoyed the fact that there are so many nationalities represented. Most things are written in Spanish, English, German, Italian and French. And you see all sorts of folks. The Europeans wear skimpier bathing suits generally than Americans do, which can be good news or bad news depending on the person. Speedos on a large old man don't look so hot. But string bikinis on a young, in-shape woman aren't so shabby. There is a bit of topless action going on. We saw maybe 5-6 women a day without their top. Again, sometimes good news, sometime bad, depending on the age and fitness level of the woman in question. Playa del Carmen is a neat town ... plenty to do and see and much less touristy than Cancun or Cozumel. There are lots of excursions offered, and next time we might do some. This time, however, we were into vegging out, soaking up sun and food/drinks and being together. There is plenty for kids to do, though since we were there in October there weren't that many kids there. That was fine with us. We're sure it's pretty full of kids in summer. The rooms aren't super fancy, but very comfortable. Our AC worked like a champ, and there was CNN and the Spanish-language version of ESPN (which includes some U.S. programming -- we got baseball playoffs but no college football). The shower ran hot/cold some, but everything is clean and decent. The staff was very nice and make the stay pleasant. There is entertainment at night but we didn't go. Same with the disco. Internet access is fairly cheap (an hour free with ByRequest membership, as I said) and it was nice to check e-mail and get a bit of surfing in. One last thing -- there is some neat gardeny/jungly area with lots of wildlife. There are these guinea pig looking things that seem very tame and are neat to look at. We also saw a small iguana and some other lizards. (That iguana is not to be confused with the one that one guy hauls around and poses on the arm and/or head of guests while a photographer snaps digital shots that can be purchased that evening for $10 ... or not. Another guy's got a little spider monkey that he poses with guests. We bought the shot with my wife and thought it was worth it.)

I think is is rated 3+ or 4 with the travel agency I used. I had no major problems with this resort when I visited it in early Dec 2002. My friends were getting married there that week so perhaps we did get some special treatment. However it is true that you get treated the way you treat staff. I found the staff to be quite friendly and helpful. If you need someone who speaks English go to the front desk. We did have a long wait to check in - I think check-in was around 3pm and we arrived early. We didn't get our rooms til about 4pm though. One of the couples in our party didn't like their room, asked for a change, and got it within a couple hours. Food is plentiful and quite good. We had some picky eaters in our group and they all easily found something to eat. IN addition to the 2 a la carte restaurants on site, you can make a reservation at the Viva Azteca, just down the road. We did this one night, just for a change. I liked the drinks at Viva Maya. I persisted on the strawberry daquiris - ask for a banana in it, even better. And the pool was almost never full since there weren't alot of kids there that week. It's true this is known as a European resort, but we met some nice people from Maine at the pool bar and chatted it up. And it is also true that you need to \"reserve\" a good chair with your beach towel at around 7:30am. That didn't bother me because it made sure I didn't sleep through the lovely weather. The beach is shrinking due to hurricanes but that also didn't bother me since the water is just so warm. The color is also a nice turquoise, so it is nice to look at. There are boogie boards and kayaks on site that you can use for free. You can walk along the beach for quite a bit. Watch the cruise ships that stop at Cozumel fro your beach chair. Also, we booked a day trip on a catamaran (look for a girl named Buffy roaming the beach). I can't remember how much it was (I think 40 USD) but it includes drinks and food and a couple of stops, one at a private secluded beach to do some snorkeling (saw a stingray) and another to swim in a spot where the river meets the ocean (cold water at surface, warm water below). We also did a day trip to XCaret (that was a bit pricey but worth it, I think it was about 80USD). Float down the underground river, lie in the comfy hammocks, check out the animals, swim with the dolphins, lay on the wonderful beach, and definitely stay for the night show which displays a musical history of Mexico using costume and dance. And from the resort you can walk or take a cab (have pesos on hand for cabs, the ride is about 50 pesos, 5 USD) into town to hit 5th avenue. Apparently the farther you walk down the street the better the deals get, but I just stuck close to the entrance. I just wanted to get back into my beach chair. There are also tennis courts at the resort if you are so inclined. Oh and there is nightly entertainment and daily lessons in various types of dance (salsa, meringue).

We are in our early 30's/no kids. Overall, we had a nice time. ROOM We had an oceanview room with a king bed (which was rather comfortable - standard mattress/boxspring set up). We had read several reviews about hard beds, but that was not the case with us. We did talk to another couple later in the week who complained about their bed (they had a room with 2 beds). The room wasn't anything spectacular, but it was adequate. We had a refrigerator in our room. The balcony is small, but it is large enough for two to sit/stand comfortably. Overall, the room was clean and suited us fine during our stay. FOOD/DRINKS The buffet is okay. For the most part, we were always able to find something to eat. And, that says a lot because my husband is a somewhat picky eater. We did try several of the specialty restaurants - Bambu, Portofino, and Viva Cafe. We enjoyed all 3 of them. Viva Cafe is worth the $5 per person charge. The drinks were pretty good. We especially enjoyed the lobby bar. We were able to interact more with the bartenders there and had a great time. They make every effort to remember you and your drink preferences. BEACH The beach is very nice. Unfortunately, \"reserving chairs\" is still an issue. Most people were up before 7 AM to put towels on the chairs - which made finding a desirable place to sit/lie down difficult if you didn't participate in the early morning ritual. The worst part is that most of the chairs remain empty most of the day. There are plenty of chairs on the beach - if people would only reserve the chairs when they are actually ON THE BEACH and using them, then there would not be an issue. EXCURSIONS We did two excursions while there - ATV Explorer and a tour of the Ruins. Be prepared to get EXTREMELY DIRTY/DUSTY during the ATV Explorer excursion. It was quite an adventure though. Of course, the Ruins were nice. DOWNTOWN AREA We did venture downtown. Of course, the vendors try to encourage you to stop in their stores and shop. Overall, it was nice. On our way back one night, we did ask our taxi driver to take us by somewhere to get a taco. He took us to a small, somewhat out of the way place (don't remember the name) that was EXCELLENT. The (soft shell) taco was not the typical \"American\" taco. In fact, it was the best taco I've had. It was so good that I'm not even sure that it should be called a taco since it was nothing like the tacos here in the US. I think I've covered the main areas. Overall, this was a great trip, especially for the price. We didn't go in expecting a 5 star resort because we didn't pay 5 star prices, so a good time was had by all.

A personal thanks must go to the \"Animation\" team who put so much effort into all the activities and the live evening shows. Each show was professionally produced thanks to the seemingly constant rehearsals (even at midnight, ready for the next night's show). The hotel itself was very well equipped, although our only slight complaint was the standard of the rooms, which we felt needed a lick of paint. However, this is our only criticism and after all, we had no real reason to spend much time in the room , apart from to sleep! The restaurants were superb and they never seem to run out of food, no matter what time you arrive to eat. A particular favourite was the \"Bamboo\" restaurant in the Viva Azteca just down the road. Also, in the \"Portofino\", it was worth dining there just to watch the waiters pour the flaming liquors into the coffees! Our main recommendation would be to find out the cost of the excursions run by the hotel, before booking through your tour operator, as they use the same local firms, but cost approx $20 US each less! Either that or try and book on one run by our European neighbours, who all seem to pay far less for the same tours than the British. Nothing new there!

My wife and I did not really advance plan this trip, we simply wanted to get out of town for a couple of days to get away from the daily grind. 1. The bad (not much): The air conditioners in the room were having a hard time keeping the room really cool. They definately worked, but they probably could have been a little more powerful. We kept ours on high all 3 days, and the room never did get quite as cool as we wanted. At one time it started to make a noise (overheating maybe) abd they came and fixed it. They told us to not run it so long at high but we had to ignore that instruction. Also, the AC's in the restaurant (Portofino) were not turned down cool enough. I realize I am very hot natured, was a little sunburned, and maybe a spoiled AC loving Houstonian, but it was too warm for me. We received a call saying that since we were Wyndham club members we had a special gift waiting for us up front. This unfortunately, was a thinly disguised timeshare come on which I picked up on immediately. We spent the rest of the three days avoiding that desk. WHY DO THEY DO THIS GARBAGE!!! They did not enforce the \"no saving beach chairs rule.\" Most guests simply left their towels out for their entire stay regardless if they were using them or not, effectively blocking off certain desirable spots. 2.

First of all, I was never told that most of the resort is actually time share vacationers. When we first got to the resort, no one was even there to help us, answer questions, or show us around. This was out first trip here and we really received no welcome. I also wasn't told that the resort is mostly European, so we basically had no one to talk with for the week. We wanted to meet other couples who spoke English. This was a little disappointing. It seemed to me that our travel agent should have shared that. As a first timer to this resort and Mexico, that would be something to tell your customer. The other reviews are right- there are no palapas unless you literally get up and go out to reserve one at 6:30 AM. It's vacation. Who wants to get up that early and walk down to the beach and get a chair? And if you don't get a chair, you really won't get one all day. We saw chairs taken up with towels by people who never even showed up until well after noon! There are signs posted asking you to not reserve the chairs, but there all get reserved early in the morning. My husband and I were told to attend a hotel briefing to update us on the hotel (by our travel agent), but when we got there, we were only pressured to book a trip, which were all very expensive to say the least. We didn't have a lot of money (that's why we went all inclusive), but they couldn't find one trip for us that fit our budget. Instead, we went through the resort and found very good trips for reasonable money. So, definitely don't go to this meeting if you don't plan on booking a trip. We also felt very pressured to tip (by our travel agent again). We're not cheap people, but we came all inclusive for a reason. And that reason is because everything is included. We were told by our travel agent rep at the resort to tip, and we were offended by that. It made us feel cheap. We've been to other resorts that would not not tell their customers that nor accept tips. If others want to tip, that's their choice, but we didn't like feeling we had to tip all day. The food was ok. It does get old by the sixth night, but we always managed to find something. My husband didn't bring pants, but both of the nicer restaurants require pants. We went to the Mexican one anyway, and we noticed others weren't wearing pants either. Drinks weren't that great. Never found anything that tasted that great besides the beer. The beach is nice.

We booked directly with the Wyndam website and applied for the free Wyndam preferred membership. I\u2019m not sure exactly what the membership entitled us to, but we received different colored wrist bands, a very nice room, toiletries, I believe preferred reservations at restaraunts, daily newspaper, as well as wine and a fridge stocked with beverages in our room. As a Viva guest we had use of the facilities and restaraunts at both the Viva Maya and the Viva Azteca, a 5 minute walk down the beach (or via the street). Facilities: Grounds are nicely landscaped and maintained. The single pool is kept clean, but water can get quite warm. Public areas are nicely maintained \u2013 not lavish but quite adaquate. Other than specialty restaurants, gym, disco and a few offices, no public areas are air conditioned. Great beach \u2013 white sand and gentle slope with no rocks, coral or sea grass \u2013 and is well maintained. Cute cats roam the gardens but watch out; one of the children in our party received a nasty bite. There is a definite shortage of palapas on the beach and umbrellas by the pool. People get up early and put their towels on chairs to reserve them for the day \u2013 signs descourage this but if you want any shade during the day you have to play along. While we were there, the beach palapas are generally all claimed by 6:30 am and the pool umbrellas by 7:00 am. (Note to Wyndam management \u2013 relocate the volleyball and watersports huts and build 30-40 more palapas!) Rooms: Ours was a very nice 3rd. floor room (no elevator). We had a spacious room with a pool and ocean view. Large 4-drawer dresser, TV cabinet with drawer and cupboard plus a closet with built-in cupboard gave us plenty of storage. Amenities seem to very from room to room - our neighboring room did not have dresser or tv cabinet but had a series of shelves in the closet. Maids do a superior job of cleaning. Nice fluffy towels, extra pillows and comfortable beds. Plenty of hot water and good water pressure. More than adaquate room air conditioning. One caution \u2013 If you are an early sleeper, rooms by the pool can be loud until 10:45 due to the nightly shows, and later if beach disco night (though the AC drowned out most of the disco noise). Food: Our experience is that this is where the difference in price among resorts seems to most manefest itself. Viva is a \u201cpopular priced\u201d resort so do not expect so see shrimp, imported cheeses, tender beef, or much fresh seafood. While the specialty restaraunts were a nice break from the buffet, their food is not on par with \u201cwhite tablecloth\u201d restaurants. The main buffet (not air conditioned) offered good selection and quality. Always lots of fresh fruit and salads. Breakfast includes all of the regular items as well as cooked-to-order eggs and omelets. Good variety at lunch. Dinner selection is good and varied from day-to-day. Best was Mexican Night (freshly-made tortillas with stewed fish and chicken in a red sauce). Good selection of desserts presented nicely \u2013 most things very sweet. Best were the flans. Pool-side buffet open all afternoon \u2013 fruit, excellent fresh guacamole, salad, OK hamburgers and hotdogs and a few other items. After dinner no food is available except for some pre-made tuna and chicken salad sandwiches at the bar. Specialty restaraunts have nice ambiance, are mostly air conditioned and have very profesional service, but food generally no higher quality than buffet \u2013 though presented and garnished very nicely. Viva Caf\u00e9 (in town and $5 extra plus cab fare) had limited menu but was nice change from resort. Portofino (mediteranian) OK - flaming coffees provide nice tableside show. La Scala OK as well. These three restaraunts have very similar food with Italian/pasta emphasis. The best meal we had was at the Japanese restaurant. The spring rolls and beef salad appetizers were great, but spicy and some of our family members thought this food was too salty. We did not try the Mexican restaurant, which is the evening version of the non-air conditioned poolside bar. Coffee in all restaraunts was good. The resort has two bars and the drinks are quite good \u2013 they have good quality liquor if you specify brand when you order (examples: Stoli and Skyy vodka, Johhny Walker Red, Jim Beam.) I especially enjoyed some of the sipping rums \u2013 try the Bacardi Solara on the rocks\u2026yum. The lobby bartenders make very good espresso and cappacino and they also offer frozen espresso (frappacinos). Watersports: Scuba Caribe runs the scuba, snorkling, parasailing and banana boat rides for the resort. Snorkling gear available but there is nothing to see off the beach except a few scattered small fish. Snorkling trip ($30) was one hour of snorkling on a crowded reef . Our snorkling guide was very unprofessional \u2013 kept getting vertical in shallow areas to remove and clear his mask and we watched him destroy a lot of coral with his flippers\u2013 also would stop to feed the fish every couple of minutes\u2026tacky. Boogie boards available for the kids and kayaks and sailboats available for 30 minute loan. The scuba instructors/guides were experienced, professional and pleasant, but I can not recommend Scuba Caribe for anyone who looks to scuba as an important part of their vacation. Boats just OK \u2013 most offered limited or no cover, warm drinking water (if it is offered at all), and no rinse bucket or storage table. Scuba Caribe is very sales oriented. Before you even get to their shack you will be approached on the path to sign-up for activities (scuba packages, para-sailing, snorkling trips etc.) Once you get to the scuba shack, again you will be asked to commit to a multi-day scuba package. Even at the free scuba demo in the pool you will be pitched, several times, to sign up for scuba lessons. We were repeatedly asked, \"How long are you staying?\" Scuba Caribe is also VERY expensive. Dives are very rigid and sites not varied depending on interest or skill level of divers. No attempt made to separate groups or customize dives based on interest or experience. Boats are used for scheduled scuba and snorkling trips so timing is very rigid. If you plan to do more than 1or 2 dives, I highly recommend you contact another dive operator in the Playa Del Carmen area. Also, consider taking the ferry across to Cozumel for a day of spectacular diving with a Cozumel-based operator. Shows: Quite impressive \u2013 in an outdoor theater. The musical shows were lip-synched versions of mini-musicals. Dancing and costumes were extraordinary. The performers definitely give their all and are quite talented. The show highlighting traditional dances from around Mexico was the best. Did not get to see poolside water/fire show due to inadaquate seating. During the day, the performers have resort jobs \u2013kids found it cool that they could interact with the \u201cstars\u201d. Staff: Best aspect of the resort. Like our other experiences in the Maya Riviera, the people here are the most friendly, gracious people you will ever meet. The bellmen, bartenders, waiters, grounds crew, security and maids were all extremely nice and mostly multi-lingual. They are nice in a very gracious and genuine way, not in the subservient/\u201dtip-me\u201d sort of way you find at some resort locations. I encourage you to tip very frequently and generously since most of these people are supporting families on poverty wages and rely on tips. Due to Mexican labor laws and tax structure, they clear very little money other than tips. Teen programming: While planning our trip, I searched reviews for information on teen activities and programming at the resorts. I found very little. I have a very social 14 year old who dreaded going away from her friends for the week. She has now declared this the best vacation she has been on. Viva Maya has a Junior Club for 13+. They have a few scheduled sports activities during the day, and the kids are welcome to join other activities like dancing and exercising, etc. But at the show, all the teens sat together. After the show, they went to the disco, which begins at 11:30PM at night and has a full bar. I was quite hesitant about this, but found that the disco had 8-16 year olds there when they opened. After two nights, they did not allow anyone under 14 in, and by the end of the week they said you had to be 15 or older. Even on the nights the younger kids were there, they left around 12 midnight and the 14 year olds, by 12:30 PM. The music is popular American teen music - not the censored versions from the radio - so be cautioned. Also, there are mattresses outside the disco for seating. Until I was comfortable, I stayed at the door or outside, but the bar is just below the only steps to the disco, so we sat there and listened to music each night once we felt comfortable. Misc. One of the nice things about Viva Maya is its relativly small size. This was especially nice for the kids - they would constantly run into kids they had previously met at activities at the beach, pool or buffet. A big caution: In the pool/bar/theater area there are many drop-offs (20+ inches) where there are no markings or railings. There are no railings or lights to help find the stairs and the whole area is very poorly lit at night: This is a definite hazard to an older person or anyone with limited sight or agility. Also, there are no stairs into pool -only 2 laddders \u2013 so accesiblilty could be an issue. Overall: A very nice resortadn a very good value.

Some people complained that the balconies were too small, but all three of us could fit on ours with plenty of room, so it wasn\u2019t an issue. The food was decent; we really liked Portofino and the Mexican restaurant, but the food at the buffet was kinda random. The bartenders were also great (Emilio, Julio). When they saw us approaching the bar, they remembered our preferences and would have our drinks ready for us before we got to the counter, even if there was a long line!

Just request it and they will remember! The best part of the hotel is definitely the staff! They work so hard and for such long hours, but you would never guess it\u2026 they are all so very accommodating and enthusiastic, you can tell they really love their job! When we got down to the beach at 11am and all of the chairs were taken, several of the staff members carried chairs down from the pool area for us so we could be by the ocean - we didn\u2019t even have to ask! The beach/ocean was extremely clean and extremely beautiful! Much prettier than the beach we were on while riding horses in Playa del Carmen. I would recommend this hotel to both families and \"singles.\" Obviously we didn\u2019t have any kids with us (we are 21), but the staff did a great job entertaining the families that were there. The discotecha is pretty neat (meet Vicente- he is awesome), and some of the staff members organize trips to Cancun and downtown Playa del Carmen for the guests our age. Playacar is not nearly as sleazy as Cancun, but we were never bored, even when we chose to just stay at the hotel for the night. We also had a lot of fun making friends with the international guests\u2026 we met people our age from Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, etc. etc. We had so much fun at the Viva Wyndham Maya\u2026 I\u2019m embarrassed to admit that I cried when we had to leave! I hope everyone else enjoys their trip as much as we did!

We were greeted with a punch drink and noticed the cleanliness of the resort. Check in was quick and smooth. Our Bags were quickly brought down to our first floor room. We had packed Febreeze for odor control as we had heard that hotels in this area were musty or moldy. We were not to need it. Smoke odor in the room was not an issue either. We had requested a smoke free room and they were almost completely booked, so we weren\u2019t sure. But this room was very acceptable. We live in New Hampshire, so you can imagine that heat is an issue for us. They had the AC turned so high that we actually had to turn it down. It was a very refreshing relief to come back to our room during the heat of the day. The room was furnished with 2 queen sized beds, a desk, chair, TV iron board, iron, and hairdryer. All worked fine (but we never tried the iron or board!) Lighting left a little to be desired. My wife had trouble seeing in the mirror for her contacts, but was fine otherwise. A couple books were on the desk about the Mayan culture and the amenities available at the resort. I was to mine that book and we enjoyed just about everything they had to offer! The rooms were blocks of 4 stories with 5 or 6 rooms on each side of the hall. On the ground levels, all but one room on the ground level had the AC of the adjoining unit exhausting heat into the patio area. Ours was one such unit. Sitting on the patio would not happen here. It was too hot to begin with, then the AC exhaust, too! All upper level rooms had the exhaust not going into the patio of the adjoining room. This was only a first floor, I don\u2019t have to climb stairs trade off. The beds were hard, as spoken about in hotel reviews I had read. The mattress is placed on a raised concrete slab. And the mattress is hard also. If you can sleep in a sleeping bag with a roll out foam pad when you are camping, this will not be a problem, unless you choose to let it be a problem. We had no trouble sleeping. Of course, we availed ourselves of the many activities at the resort, which only helped us to sleep! Overall, this room provided a place to sleep, shower and cool off. All we need at such a resort. Each day, the towels are folded into a different shape, origami if you will. Puppies, swans; it made you anxious to come back to your room in the evening to see what surprise awaited you in the room. Bicycles are available, free of charge for 2 hours. They are one speed beach cruisers, fine for the hot, level area. Archery is available, tennis, Jacuzzis, snorkeling, sailing, windsurfing, boogie boards. And it is all inclusive. Reservations were required of the more popular diversions. The staff was friendly and helpful. You could not help but have a good time here. The night time shows were a true pleasure. Starting at 9:30 PM, the shows would run 1 \u00bd hours, performed by talented folks who truly enjoyed what they were doing. They had the total package, choreography, lighting, costumes, and most of all, enthusiasm! The drinks were typical of AI. I often ordered mine virgin. Food at the buffet restaurant was typical of AI buffet, and we never went hungry. A La Carte dining was available with reservation. Two places on property, and 2 at the sister Viva Wyndham Azteca. Portafina was to our liking and the served up flaming Mayan coffee with a show! The Mexican dining was less to our personal taste, but it was well done and served also. At the Azeteca, the Bambu was very good oriental cuisine, a very pleasant experience. The fried ice cream for dessert was to die for, as were the exotic fruits. La Scalla, at Azteca was a nice restaurant, but not what were used to. Service was good, with our glasses never empty at any of the A La Carte places. The food was well cooked and gently seasoned in each case, never overpowering. What we liked best was the diversion from our regular menu. The Viva Wyndham Maya fostered an atmosphere of fun and socializing, and new friendships are easily struck up. The activities offered provide much to share with your new found friends. Topless bathing is not accepted at the pool area, but it is accepted on the beach. Beach umbrellas are best reserved before 6:30 AM, if you want one. They request that you not leave your towels there to reserve them, but that is the only way you will ever get one. Mid way through the vacation, we did the same to be able to use an umbrella. Our friends shared ours one day. There are a lot of them, and they sit empty with a towel on them most of the day. I don\u2019t know how to keep them available for all and not upset a customer who has \u201creserved one\u201d for himself\u2026. All in all, I can not recommend this resort highly enough. The very few disparaging comments are all too easily outweighed by the many good things this place does right, and the memories they provide.

There were 8 of us. 4 adults and 4 kids. The kids ages are 4, 6, 7, and 9. They had a blast. They went to the kids club a few times at the beginning of the trip and loved the attention they received from Alessia, Joanne and Frankie who were the staff in charge of the Kids Club. They took the kids to the beach, played games at the pool, participated in archery, ping pong, tennis and even traveled to a nearby aviary. They chose to spend a few hrs. at the Kids Club and the rest of the time with us. I have to admit we missed them when they were there, but the break was nice too. The entire staff works extremely hard to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. The shows at night are great and the food is decent. A great place for families and a little relaxation. My husband spent a lot of time with the Scuba Caribe team as he was working on his open water certification and enjoyed working with Danielle and Lot who were his instructors. We enjoyed our stay so much that I chose to stay another 5 nights with just my two children while the other 5 had to go home to return to work. I have the month of July off so it worked out that I could stay. The kids and I had a great time. Make sure you try the Viva Cafe in downtown Playa Del Carmen.

We had a great time. If your looking for a hopping night spot, Viva Maya isn't it. It's geared more towards families and groups looking for a more relaxed environment, which we were. The resort is in a really nice and quiet community. The streets are cobble stone and lined with trees. There is a really nice golf course across the street and well kept private homes all around. It\u2019s more of a residential area than a tourist district (like Cancun). I felt really safe there. The kids (both 14) had plenty to do. Disco at night, playing with the other kids at the pool during the day and parasailing. The inclusive and extra fee activities kept us all busy. The wave runners were a bit pricy ($50 US for 30 minutes) but worth it. We took a sailing lesson one day then checked them out two other days on our own, very relaxing. The rooms were actually better then I had expected for Mexico. Very clean and well kept. The maid would make different animals out of the towels and place them on the beds each day. Each night the beds were turned down with mints on the pillows. Upon check in we found a bowl of fruit and drinks waiting. The mini refrigerator was filled each day with water, beer and sodas. If you plan to see the sights and want to save half over the activities desk at the resort I would recommend doing them on your own. We went to Tulum (ancient ruins) one day and Cancun another. One day we took a taxi ($5 Mexican one way) to the van station in Playa Del Carmen (the vans run up and down the highway taking the locals and tourists to their destination). Then we took the van to Tulum (an ancient ruin) which was about a 40 minute drive and cost each of us $2 Mexican one way. $16 bucks round trip for all of us, can't beat that. We got a guide at the ruins so we would know what we were looking at. That cost $45 Mexican. The whole days excursion cost $71 Mexican Pesos. The excursion desk wanted $35 Mexican Pesos each ($140 total). The second day we got the taxi to the bus station in Playa and paid $3 Mexican Pesos each one way to Cancun. Hind site tells me that this probably wasn't the cheapest thing to do. The amount for the bus was unbelievable but the taxi from the Cancun bus station to the beaches cost $16 Mexican Pesos. The math tells me that trip cost us $56 Mexican Pesos. I think a taxi from the resort to the beaches of Cancun would have been cheaper. Local transportation is really good. You can take a taxi, van or bus anywhere you want to do. The specialty restaurants were also better then I had expected. Make sure you book all of your reservations the first day you get there or you might not get in. You can book you reservation at either Wyndam resort, Viva Maya or Viva Azteca. You\u2019ll wonder why half of the tables are open at the restaurants. The reason is that they don\u2019t rush you out after your dinner. If you want to stay 3 hours they will accommodate you. Half of the seats are open so the next hours reservation will have a place to sit. If they filled them all up every hour then you would have to vacate at the end of the hour where you were finished or not to make room for the others. Or make the others wait. If you\u2019re looking for gourmet cooking then you\u2019ll need to look elsewhere. I thought the food was really good but then again I don\u2019t have really high expectations when visiting restaurants at these resorts. The buffet was a good alternative if you didn\u2019t want the specialty restaurants. There was plenty to choose from. This was the kids favorite place to eat. Make sure you wake up early and place your towels on the lounge chairs on the beach. The prime spots (under the umbrellas) fill up fast. Of course there were always lounge chairs available out in the open. The beaches were clean and picked up all throughout the day. The water was clear and warm. It was great just laying at the beach with a drink. Again very relaxing. The majority of the guests were European and as in Europe some women sunbathe topless. My son really liked it though.

I could have lived on the Guacamole it was great. I must agree with another person who said the Pasta cook was nice. I believe his name was Alejandro. The food was a mix of what everyone in the world eats because there is such and international crowd that they need to make everyone happy. The only thing I wish they had had was some cheesecake. All the people who work at the Viva Maya are top rate. I noticed that are pretty much \"Jack of all Trades\" They stop and talk to the guest during the day or maybe even sit with them during dinner. Which I liked because I got to learn a lot about the culture of Mexico from them. Our personal favorites were Honoro. Hugo, and Humberto and of couse the above mentioned Alejandro.

Boy were they all wrong! My girlfriend and I traveled to the Viva Wyndham Maya June 19-25 and enjoyed absolutely every aspect of our trip. We are both in our mid 20's so we were looking for a somewhat relaxing vacation with the option to have a few drinks and get a little crazy of an evening. We are not real big bar hoppers so we decided to stay away from Cancun. We booked our trip through Apple Vacations which turned out to be a smart choice. When we arrived at the Cancun airport we were greeted with an unbelievably long line to get through customs. Apparently a couple of planes landed at the same time so there were quite a few tourists ready to get to their resort. We had heard that customs would take forever but surprisingly we were through the long line in about 20 minutes. From here we had to go get our bags from an area that security had roped off in the airport. It looks a little overwhelming seeing all of the luggage there but dont sweat it just find your bags and show your airline issued baggage tags to the security guard and you will be on your way. We then found our Apple representative who showed us to our shuttle and we were on our way. The resort is about 45 mins to an hour from the airport depending on traffic and how fast your shuttle driver goes. The Viva Wyndham maya as well as a few other resorts is in a upscale residential area called Playacar Beach. I found this to be extremely nice due to the fact that there was no reason to worry about walking around outside our resort of an evening. Also this makes the beach even nicer because it is totally private from the beaches of Playa Del Carmen. The only people you will see on the beach will be from the handfull of resorts within this 2 mile strip. The resort is gated and no outsiders are let in except for taxis and shuttles. Across the street from our hotel is a really nice outdoor shopping mall where you can get all the sovenirs you need. Playa del carmen is in walking distance but you might as well take a taxi, it is only 4-5 usd each way. We arrived about 2 hours before the scheduled check in time but had no problem checking in early. We were greeted by a bell boy immediately upon arrival and given a rum punch welcome drink within seconds. We paid for a standard garden view room but were very surprised to see that our room was about 30 yards off of the beach and on the ground floor for easier access to the main bar. We even had a slight view of the turquoise water. Before traveling we were told that an all inclusive isnt worth the money because we would want to spend too much time away from our resort. Once again not true. Everything and I mean everything is included. There is absolutley no need to ever leave your resort unless you decide to eat at the Viva Cafe in downtown Playa Del Carmen. We did'nt spend a penny on anything until our third full day there. We did tip our bellboy as well as our room steward for their services but its only a few bucks here and there. The resort is wonderful in every way. The Viva Maya is right on the beach. The bar, the pool, the theatre, and most of the rooms are close enough to see the water. Our room was very clean. The beds were a little harder than my pillowtop mattress but c'mon its Mexico for goodness sake. We have heard people complaining about the air conditioning being too loud, we stayed in a Hilton the night before departure and the air conditioner was just as loud. We read reviews complaining that there were'nt enough outlets. How many outlets do some people need? We had one outlet in the bathroom and one in the main room behind the television. The night before departure my girlfriend had forgotten her hairdryer so we went and purchased one because we were'nt sure if they would have one in the room. They have one in the bathroom on the wall so ladies dont worry. We worried that there might not be an iron in our room so we took one with us, but there was an iron and ironing board in the closet. There is a safe in the room to put your valuables in, and trust me this is where your wallet will be the whole time. Gentlemen not to worry, you have a balcony to sit on and drink a cold beer while your ladies are doing their hair and makeup :) Fortunately we were just steps away from the main bar, so we could stay hydrated while getting ready for dinner of an evening. The rooms have a bottle of water for drinking, brushing your teeth, etc. and there are water coolers in the hallway to refill. The restaurants are all very good. The buffet was much more than expected with an unbelievable variety of food for breakfast lunch and dinner. Viva Cafe was absolutely our favorite of all the restaurants. It does cost 5 usd per person to eat there though as well as taxi fare into town but it is well worth it. This 5 dollars includes all food and all alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks. The Mexican restaurant is pretty neat because of an evening they set up tables in the main bar area by the pool to eat dinner. It is a nice classy meal with exceptional service. Portofino was probably our least favorite of all the restaurants, but not because of the quality of the food or service. We just liked the atmospheres of the other restaurants a little better. It is worth it to at least try it though. The food here is good just in smaller portions, but dont worry just ask for more. Every meal includes a starter, main course, and dessert, as well as some sort of welcome drink upon arrival. Of an evening we liked to hang out at the lobby bar, they usually have live music playing there to keep you entertained while you enjoy a cocktail or people watch. Try the peanuts of an evening at the lobby bar they are pretty unique in taste and go pretty well with a cold beer. As far as the drinks go the only beer they have is Dos Equis Lager on tap, but once again youre in Mexico you might as well enjoy some tastes of their culture. They have an excellent selection of liquors and wines, both local and international brands. Im not sure that I can put into words how well the staff does. They are phenominal at what they do. They are on the beach or by the pool all day long keeping guests happy and of an evening they put on shows that are very good. We are not the type of people that usually set down and watch broadway style shows but these were worth the time. There is always something going on to keep you entertained both day and night. Or you can just sleep on the beach all day long, its entirely up to you. The beach volleyball games get pretty heated sometimes if you like some friendly competition and my girlfriend says the pool aerobics are a great workout. Being Americans we felt a little like the minority but as long as you can smile and say hello, ola, etc. you will be fine. We spent alot of time wishing we could understand what alot of people were saying but it just made us realize that we should learn to speak another language and quit being so shallow. The beach was wonderful. The water was beautiful. All watersports are included in your package (kayaking, windsurfing, boogie boards, sail boats, snorkeling at your resort, etc). One thing we did realize is that you do need to get to the beach early to get a umbrella, but hey its vacation and your at the beach. Get out of bed, go get one and fall asleep on the beach listening to the ocean. Beach towels are included and you can return them at the end of the day and get new ones the next day. I recommend taking the snorkeling tour offered by a company on the Viva Wyndham Maya beach. They take you down the beach about 20 minutes to a protected reef to see some beautiful underwater scenery. After the shows of an evening take a trip to the disco. Don't be afraid that it might only be Latino music. The DJ played anything you can imagine. The staff are in the disco after the show to keep things hopping and they keep it fun. There is also a bar in the disco to keep you hydrated while you shake your booty. One night after the show the resort had a beach party with a DJ. They set up a bar, lights and the whole 9 yards. I have to say that the Viva Wyndham Maya is the place to be on Playacar beach. It is a mix of both relaxing and fun all together. You can do as little or as much as you want and not have to spend a dime doing it. The staff is great, the food is great and the beach is breathtaking. Of an evening we would walk down the beach and all of the other resorts would be dark and quiet with no atmosphere at all, while the Viva Maya was rocking all night long. When we were picking up other passengers to head back to the Cancun airport, they asked us what resort we stayed at and they all said that they wished they had stayed there because it looked like so much fun.

This was our third trip to Mexico. We loved the \"Viva\". The one and ONLY complaint I have is that I booked a King room and got a room with 2 double beds. I did nothing about it so I have myself to blame. There was nothing else wrong with the room. Some said the rooms were dark. Ours was bright. Some said no outlets. We had outlets. Some said crappy bathroom. Our bathroom was perfect. Folks, this is not the Four Seasons and we did not pay Four Seasons rates. You cannot expect the Four Seasons. This resort is as good as it gets for the price. The restaurants were great. The help was wonderful. The beach is absolutely incredible. The water is warm and clear and the sand white and soft. You can walk and walk and the beach is prettier and prettier. The other places we stayed at had very rocky and almost unswimmable beaches. The pool was clean and warm like bath water.Here are a few things that are noteworthy. Most people said reserve a palapa. Do not take that lightly. My husband went to the beach at 6 a.m. sharp and there were others already there to reserve. The signs say not to \"save\" a palapa but everyone does. There was NO soap, shampoo, lotion, or shower cap in the room. This was the first time I did not bring all those things and was stuck. There is liquid wash in a dispenser but no samples of anything. There was no fridge in our room. There is a palapa type roof over most of the walkways. In the event of rain you can get around and stay dry. Excellent! If you look like a first timer in Mexico, you will be swamped with \"Club\" salespeople. They will offer you the moon. Say no thank you to anyone who approaches you about anything.

Just got back a couple weeks ago. totally chilled when you want it to be, but there's always something to do. The staff always say hello and smile, they really have some great people working there. I'm not going to break down the vacation like everyone else did (too soon for that, will make me want to go back) just remember a couple things: DEFINITELY arrange transportation with the hotel before getting to the airport. the minute you make it through customs you will be hounded by every single person working at the airport. \"Take this taxi\" \"Come over here friend\" yadda yadda. It's so great to see your name on a sign to take you away from the madness. trust me, the airport sucks. And one more thing. Enjoy the hotel. Don't worry about seeing every ancient geological site within 60 miles of the place, sure do a few outings, but don't forget that you have the most amazing hotel at your disposal... we did do some really great things, but we also had a blast doing absolutely nothing but sleeping on a beach chair under a palapa.", "Date": "May 26, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, CO", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Incredible!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1979280", "Content": "Just returned back from an 11 day stay at the Viva Wyndham Maya, and it was absolutely incredible. I simply cannot think of one bad thing to say about the resort. The food was incredible. Let me say that again, the food was incrediible. The drinks were unbelievable as well. Let me give you some advice. First, you absolutely must join the Wyndham By Request Club. It is free at wyndham's website. This allows you to be a VIP duriing your stay, and again, it does not cost anythiing to join. The person at Guest Services to know is Arley Lopez. No matter what you need, she will make sure your stay is incredible, but being a By Request Memebr does allow you to get a little bit better service as well as room upgrades. If you do not join, you will still be taken care of, but it is free so you might as well take the five minutes necessary to join. I will rate the restaurants now, but before I do that, just know the grounds, tennis courts, pools, beach, etc. are all in impecable condition and the staff there is always cleaning, always.Restaurants: #1-La Scala (Azteca), #2-Viva Cafe Downtown Playa Del Carmen, #3-Portofino (Maya)/Japenese Restaurant (Azteca), #4-Mexican Restaurant at Maya, #5-La Tarraza Buffet at Maya whiich is incrediible for a buffet. You can use the restaurants at the Azteca even if you stay at the Maya.I read every single review on the Maya and the Azteca on TripAdvisor before going because I could not believe the price. Well, you will have the time of your lives, and save in the pocket book. Simply incredible, and remember to get to know Arley Lopez. Ths is very important. Awesome place!!!One other tip, book your airport transfers with Arley for around $42US roundtrip. When you get through imigration and the green light/red light test your next step is to head outside where you will find transportation people holding up signs with your name on them. Look here to find your transportatioin. If you get pass these guys without finding your transportation, you will be hounded by every taxi man in Mexico.Oh, and to all those people who complained about the hotel. What a bunch of complaining losers. Never saw a time share person the whole trip by the way. And lastly, if you are Americans like we are, please be courteous to others and don't get so drunk that you make asses out of yourselves. Only peple down there at the Maya that were rude were sadily to say Americans which made us pretty sad.Awesome place, you will love it!!!

One of our best vacations ever. Just returned from a 7 night stay with my wife and two boys (7&11), and we were all extremely impressed with the resort. STAFF: Excellent. Front desk was efficient and courteous. Themed restaurant staff was very attentive. Activities staff was the best. This international crew really made the vacation special. They were energetic, funny and very talented. Bar and maid staff was great, too, though they seemed to speak less English, but this was never really an issue. FOOD: Better than I expected. We hit the buffet restaurant the first 4 nights. Quality was great. If you\u2019re an adventurous eater, you\u2019ll find the selection and variety is ample. There were lots of dishes I never heard of, but I tried them all, and loved them. Of the 3 themed restaurants we tried, Portofinos is the best. At the end of your meal, try the flaming Mayan coffee\u2026excellent. The Mexican restaurant is set up near the pool bar every night, and we found this great, too. Tipping is supposed to be included, but we found the service so outstanding, that we tipped anyway. The last night we ate at the Italian restaurant at the Viva Azteca (sister resort) down the street. Food was very good (though not the typical pasta/lasagna Italian menu that most Americans might be used to). Thought the service here was a little slow. If you\u2019re only going to do a couple specialty restaurants, the Italian one might be the one to skip. The whole Azteca resort seemed a little too slow and laid back for us. I was glad I choose the more lively Viva Maya instead. BEACH: Very good and very well maintained. Spotless and no trash\u2026 though it\u2019s not in the league of Bermuda or Virgin Island beaches. The Viva Maya has a nice 100 yard strip of beach among a continuous mile or so of Playacar resort strip beach. It\u2019s all fully developed. You have to go about \u00bc mile south to hit undeveloped beach. If you walk a full mile south, you\u2019ll come to a small beach in a cove surrounded by rocks. Very picturesque and quiet. Not maintained though, so there\u2019s a little trash here and there. I\u2019ve heard this cove is a good place to snorkel along the rocks, but there was too much surf to snorkel the week we were there. Back to the Viva beach...what\u2019s nice and different from all the other area resort beaches, is that the pool is real close. You can just about sit at the top of the beach, and watch your kids in both the ocean and the pool at the same time. They say not to reserve the palapas in the morning\u2026 but if you want to sit under one\u2026 you\u2019ll have to flaunt the rule and get down there before 7am. POOL: kind of small, but very nice design, great location, and despite size, never seemed too crowded. Close proximity to beach, and you gotta love the poolside bar with submerged bar stools. My kids got a big kick out of drinking virgin frozen coladas while sitting in the pool. They have regularly scheduled water aerobics, dancing, and my favorite was the water polo. The polo was a blast, but if you play goal, beware of the ledges under the goal. I\u2019m still nursing a gash on my leg. BARS: Poolside bar was fabulous. Friendly bartenders, good service. Not top shelf liquor, but I didn\u2019t find the drinks watered down. Beer is limited to Dos Equis, but under the hot sun, that was good enough for me. They also have lots of self-serve non-alcoholic juices/drinks by the bar. The bar by the lobby is a bit spiffier. Good place for a drink before/after dinner. GUESTS: 75% European. I had no problems, and actually enjoyed the diverse crowd. Played a lot of volleyball, water polo and other activities with them and had a great time. I liked the exposure to this varied crowd. I found most to be very friendly and a very fun crowd. I thought it was good for my kids, too. Despite the language barrier, they were frequently playing with kids of all nationalities. SHOPPING: Time share hawkers everywhere, especially in town. Even in the airport! We actually sat through the vacation club pitch at the viva maya, and collected a pretty good free gift. But the pitch was VERY high pressure. I did the math, and found it only a fair deal\u2026and only if you plan to vacation regularly for the next 30 years. Shopping in town was ok, but you couldn\u2019t walk ten feet without being hustled to come into a shop. I found it too annoying. The little mall across the street may not have as good deals but it\u2019s much more pleasant place to shop. There\u2019s some hawkers on the beach, too. They\u2019ll generally go away with a polite no thanks. I did buy a blanket on the beach. Thought I got a good deal because I haggled from $60 down to $30, only to find it for sale at the airport duty free shop on the way home for $9. Oh well. EXCURSIONS: We bought a Tulum/Xel-ha tour. Mistake. I should have taken the advice I read in these reviews about taking a taxi and buying my own tickets. The tour was very expensive, and there were a lot of hassles associated with taking the initial van, then waiting for the big bus in town, and waiting through the return ride back. And Tulum is not good for small kids. With searing 90deg heat and sun, they had no patience to listen to the Mayan tour guide slowly walk us through the ruins. If I were to do it again (with kids), I\u2019d skip the ruins, buy my Xel-ha (or Xcaret) tickets in advance on the internet, bring my own snorkel gear (to avoid long equipment lines) and take taxis. Xel-ha itself is wonderful. My son and I loved the snorkeling. No coral reefs\u2026 but interesting limestone formations, and lots of fish. Recommend the ruins only if you don\u2019t have young kids. ROOMS: Spartan, but clean. You\u2019ll find you spend little time in the room, so it\u2019s not a big deal. English speaking cartoon network TV channel was good for the kids during siesta breaks. The rest was Spanish speaking channels. Sometimes a slight sewage whiff from the bathroom floor drain, which irked my wife a bit. Beds were hard as everyone has said, but we all slept great. My wife brought a camping mattress, but ended up not using it. SHOWS: Great, especially considering that they were performed by a staff aged 18-25?? These guys were pretty talented and entertaining. One complaint is they started a bit late (930pm) for young kids to enjoy the shows. Beware the \"talent show\". If you get sucked into this (like I did) the staff is real good at getting you sucked into some embarrassing skits. All in good fun though. KIDS CLUB: Didn\u2019t use, but the kids I saw in it seemed to be having a blast, did very cool activities, and the staff worked great with them. This was the same staff that performed in the night shows. The kids seemed to really bond with this crew, because even outside of kids club activities, they were always running up and socializing with the staff. I was very impressed. OVERALL VALUE: Excellent. If you\u2019re an outgoing person/family who will take advantage of the activities, and enjoy the international crowd, you\u2019ll love it. I\u2019d go again in a heartbeat.", "Date": "April 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value, Great People\u201d", "Author": "Nandoverman", "ReviewID": "UR1845186", "Content": "My extended family of 7 (me, my wife, 2 sons, parents-in-law, brother-in-law) stayed at the Viva Maya for 10 days in April. Just got back last night. I will start by saying I can still see the smiling faces of the hotel staff. Here are the highlights. I will try to write about things that have not been written before, to give a wider spectrum of experience. I had booked three rooms. I had been afraid our rooms would be dispersed throughout the hotel complex after reading some previous reviews. However, my fear disappeared when we arrived at the hotel to find a welcome greeting for my family at the bulletin board. We received keys for three rooms right next to each other, having great views of the ocean. Contrary to some other reviews, I found the rooms quite adequate. Definitely not first class, but has all the comforts you need. Firm beds, but not hard. Pillows were great (did they change them?). I found the room adequately lighted with five separate light sources - one at the entrance ceiling, one on the central ceiling, one each at each bed-side, one in the bathroom. Electrical outlets in the bathroom and behind the TV. Downside: 1) air conditioner was way loud, 2) bedroom and bathroom details needed much rework, 3) tile floors sometimes got damp from humidity. If you were expecting to stay most of the daytime outside by the beach, these shortcomings shouldn't bother you. I tipped my maid a dollar every day. She left us with more towels, and more drinks. Restaurants were good. The buffet menu changed daily. With all the variety, you are bound to find something you like. The staff is attentive and nice, even though it is obviously extremely hot behind the cooking stations. The pasta maker is the nicest of them all (I did not get his name). I tipped the waitors a couple dollars at every meal. They will remember you!!! This is especially because nobody else in the mostly European crowd tips them! I figure the focused service you get when you return for the next meal is more than worth . The a la carte restaurants were good. The best was La Scala at the Azteca. We ate there twice, and we figured out the menu doesn't change. Try Vitello Tonnato for appetizer and Risotto con Gamberi. For all restaurants, book the early seatings. The staff will be more rested and ready. The food is better at the early seatings. Portofino was definitely the most entertaining of the restaurants. Even if you choose not to drink it, order Irish coffee after dinner. The show is worth it. Food was not as good as La Scala (and I couldn\u2019t figure out what was so Mediterranean about the restaurant). Viva Mexico serves great drinks. Food is typical Mexican. We made reservations for Viva Caf\u00e9 and the Bambu, but never made it to the restaurants. We spent most of our time at the pool or at the beach, so we interacted most with the staff by the pool \u2013 bar staff, activity staff, pool caf\u00e9 staff. I made good friends with a couple of bartenders. Not by tipping (which admitted helps), but mostly by displaying your willingness/eagerness to learn Spanish. Even if you are terrible at it, your interest in their language opens up several doors. Instead of ordering a beer, order a cerveza. Instead of ordering a Coke with ice, order una Coca con hielo. This leads to better service and drinks. The next time you order a Tequila, you will get the good Centenario or Sauza instead of the cheap stuff. Hilario is a good man. If you connect with him, you will have a good time at the bar. The caf\u00e9 is very convenient when you are at the pool and too lazy to venture up to the buffet restaurant. The food does not change much, but the points are for convenience. Activity staff is just awesome. These are kids from all around the world (Mexico, Canada, Italy, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Denmark, Costa Rica, Spain, France, etc) who are energetic and outgoing. My hat\u2019s off to them. They are always eager to pull you into their activities. They also run the nightly shows. All the previous reviews on their shows are correct. These shows are both good and bad. It is bad in the sense that they are not your 42nd street quality shows. However, they are excellent in the sense that these kids work their butts off to prepare for these events every night. And it is indeed better because you can identify with the Michael Jackson imitator who taught you to dance the Merengue that afternoon, or the performer (Jugo) that taught you to sail the catamaran that afternoon, or the John Travolta singer (Jors) that ran your son\u2019s Kid\u2019s club that morning. Good, clean entertainment. Even better spirits! If you like to scuba dive, use the Scuba Caribe at the beach. It is convenient and they know what they are doing. Ana is the best instructor. Taught my 10-year-old to dive. She is one of the best teachers (diving or otherwise) I have ever seen. Coordinate your diving schedule with Stefan. He is very good at figuring out what you want to do. He suggested cave-diving, and I am glad he convinced me to try it. I find it difficult to put that experience into words! Stein is a good cave guide. You must visit Xel-ha and Tulum. We were too lazy to go elsewhere (which also leaves us things to do when we go back!). We used the tour service desk at the beach. And by the way, the previous review post that claims the beach desk is cheaper than the front-office desk is absolutely correct. The beach desk is about 15 to 20% cheaper. However, thinking back, if we were to do the tour again, I would just get a cab, or rent a car to go on tours. It would be both cheaper and more convenient. If you book a tour, a van will pick you up at the hotel at around 8:30. They herd you to a shopping mall at Playacar where you register (pay) for tours. You sit around in the heat for another 30 minutes or so waiting for the tour bus that originated from Cancun. You get packed into the already crowded bus. They drive you to Xel-ha and Tulum, but only after they stop at a local souvenir shop on the way, using use of bathrooms as an excuse (they get kickbacks from these shops). I figure I lost about 2 hours of valuable vacation time during transit and waiting. My tips: 1) Attempt to speak Spanish. 2) Bring $1 bills for tipping. 3) Bring lots of sunscreen. 4) Arrange for your own tours, not tour packages. 5) Bring walkie-talkies if you have them. 6) Whatever clothes you think you need, reduce it by half. You will not use them You will mostly be in your beach wear. 7) I hear Viva Caf\u00e9 is very good. I should have tried it. 8) Don\u2019t bring snacks. Food is everywhere. 9) If you need transportation to/from the airport, use the local taxi ($35). Hotel bus is expensive. I used the Green Line Service (Cancun 886-00-23). No reservation required in advance. 10) Arrive early when you depart. Security searches through everything. 11) If you want to snorkel at the beach, walk south on the beach for about half a mile. There are some rocks there. There are a lot of fish there. 12) Try the catamaran. It is easier than you think. 13) Ride the buggieboard if waves are big. You will have fun. 14) Try dancing the Merengue at least once. I won\u2019t do it again, but it\u2019s worth at least one attempt. 15) Bring your family. 16) Lastly, treat the staff as your friends. They are warm people. They will treat you like family. I have too much to write, with little time to do it.

(Last year we stayed at the Riu Yucatan, just down the beach from this resort.) Check the Viva website at : http://www.vivaresorts.com/homepage_en.html . What you see is what you get. Let me say that we were not overly happy with this resort before we even left, because our travel agent (I don\u2019t blame her \u2013 she was just the messenger) called us the week before we were to leave to tell us that the resort was downgrading our \u201cocean view superior room\u201d to a \u201cgarden view superior room\u201d. Note: there are only 2 types of rooms offered: ocean view superior and garden view superior. What made them \u201csuperior\u201d instead of \u201cstandard\u201d I\u2019m not sure... Every other property on this strip was booked solid, so we really had no choice, unless we went somewhere completely different. We flew Skyservice, out of Toronto. The only comment about the flight that I have is this: This was the first time that I was ever served a boxed lunch. On our return flight, the employees on the flight were willing to take your left over pesos to donate to Canadian Charities. That\u2019s a novel idea! There were mostly Italians and Germans, with few French, Canadians and Americans. I commend the animation team for having to speak 5 languages! Be prepared to get asked to join the \u201cVIP club\u201d at the Viva resorts. More than once, I, being super-not-interested-don\u2019t-bug-me-I\u2019m-on-vacation, had to be pretty clear that I was sooooo not interested. The resort itself is clean and gardens are well kept. The rooms were simply \u201cwhat is required\u201d. Ours was located on the third floor, overlooking the garden, which was really like a forest of trees. At least we didn\u2019t look at the next resort! The paths from the lobby area to our building were covered with clay-tiled roofs or thatched roofs. This became important when it rained two of the evenings that we were there. Our room had 2 queen size beds that seemed a little low, with no box spring, simply set on a concrete slab. The pillows were not flat. The maid always created a towel animal in our room, as well as tissue \u201cflowers\u201d. The room contained an electronic safe in the closet, and there are shelves beside it. Flipping through the channels on the \u201csatellite\u201d TV, produced a handful of channels, only two were English (CNN, I think, and a movie channel that had Spanish subtitles). IMPORTANT: the only receptacle in the entire room is in the washroom. The sink in the washroom seemed incredibly high, and occasionally there was the aroma of sewage. Our sink always dripped, unless you turned it off tightly. There is a hair dryer in the washroom and a bathtub with shower. I think every room had a super small balcony with one small table and two plastic chairs. The air conditioner was constantly on, and noisy. The buffet restaurant staff was usually friendly and efficient. The selection was about the same as any hotel on this strip. The restaurant at the pool bar made great hamburgers and French fries. There was an adequate selection of food, albeit the same every day. An ice cream machine is also at the pool bar. We also took advantage of the affiliated restaurant in Playa del Carmen, \u201cViva Caf\u00e9\u201d. A 50 peso cab ride got us there. The Viva Caf\u00e9 was outstanding! Great service, and presentation. All for 105 pesos. Two bars, to keep you happy at all times. Check out \u201cEder\u201d at the lobby bar. Tip him, and he\u2019ll remember your order every time, and have it waiting for you! \u201cAngel\u201d at the pool bar makes a superb Banana Daiquiri. We took our own insulated cups\u2014larger than the drink glasses, and kept your drink nice and cold. The animation team has activities all day, every day. They also were the entertainment at the evening show, which started around 9:30ish. One night, we lost power, so our rooms were dark, and only emergency lighting around the resort, and the animation team had to improvise. They did a great job. Tuesday evening, before the show, vendors came in to the theatre area to sell you jewellery, carvings and blankets. The beach was lovely! We felt quite safe walking the beach every morning. There are a few vendors on the beach, but not overly pushy, which I was grateful for. You can get a massage, manicure, pedicure, henna, or braids on the beach at a couple of the hotels on this beach. The pool is split into 3 sections, one for little kids, the deepest section allows for scuba lessons (free afternoon demo available), and the largest section for water games, aqua aerobics, pool bar, etc. If you want a lounge chair, you should get out there around 8:00 am and put something on it, like a towel, a book, your sandals, or you\u2019ll be out of luck. Very few topless on the beach, and almost non-existent by the pool. There is a sign by the showers that states, \u201cno topless\u201d.

Our five year old loved every minute of it. Here are the details: Reservations - made them directly thru Wyndham and got a web rate of USD 140/night (not per person). Most people that we talked to could not believe the rate we got. There are some other advantages to going thru Wyndham - you have a VIP checkin area, and you can reserve the restaurants by phone up to 3 days in advance. Room - After reading the reviews here we had a pleasant surprise - the rooms were spotless and the beds were great - so were the pillows. Either Wyndham has made updrades or I dont understand what people are talking about . We have travelled all over the world and I would rate the room quality a solid 3.5* to 4*. Food - The buffet provided the best choices for kids but La Scala (at the Viva Azteca) and Portofino proved excellent. We ate at a la carte restaurants 4 nights out of 6, but you need to reserve early. My wife is vegetarian, so choices on some days were limited esp. in the buffet. Staff - The most courteous, friendly staff I have ever seen. Really outstanding service. Kids and adults activities were always ongoing. Location - Very convenient being right across from the Playa shopping complex. Playa del Carmen is about a 15min walk or 40pesos by taxi. Beach is just awesome, powdery sand (we are pretty picky having lived in Florida for 17 years) Excursions - Best advice would be to get a car and do it on your own - we did and no problems. You can find cars on the web at $25/day if you have your own insurance. If you want to take a package tour, the PdelC tour operators are abou $15 cheaper per person than the Viva tour desk. Guests - about 20% american/canadian, rest italian, french, german, spanish. I thought this was the best part (unlike other reviewers who dont want to be in an English speaking \"minority\") - hey come on, broaden your horizons a little! Problems - The shows start at 9:30pm and can get a little loud if you are near the theater. As in most of mexico, hallways tend to be loud because they are not carpeted.

I went with my family and my friend and her parents at Christmas time from December 21-January 4, 2004. It was the best time I have ever had in my life so far. We all had the most amazing time and were SO sad to have to go home. The Animation Team Staff were the nicest people and always did whatever they could to make sure we were having the best time possible. We met SO many people from all over the world, lots of people from Alberta and Winnipeg that we still keep in contact with today! Each day we woke up around 8:00-9:00 and then had showers quick and went to go eat Breakfast. Sometimes when there are empty chairs at your table the Animation Team will come and ask if they can join you to eat because they need to eat with guests...Everybody of course always said yes, but you could say no too. After breakfast we would tan or go in the ocean or pool until Dancing came on at 12:15. This was VERY fun and we did it every single day for the 2 weeks. You could come with a partner or the Animation Team would partner you up with somebody. If you were lucky, you would get to be partners with staff. Then, right after Dancing, at 12:45 is Water Polo. Lots of teenagers and even adults play this and it was one of the most popular activities to do. Also, many people played Beach Volleyball. Other activities through-out the day include: Meringue Dancing, Salsa Dancing (These dance lessons change by what the evening show is, ex: Belly Dancing Show- Belly Dancing for the dance lessons during the day & Country show- country for the dance lessons, etc.), Spanish Lessons, Bingo (Very popular game there- includes if you don't really have a Bingo, the adults have to take a shot of tequila and the kids get thrown in the pool, also if Staff scews up they take shot of Tequila), Water Aerobics, Step Aerobics, Bocce Ball, Tennis...etc. SO many more...Also, each day there would be a different competition for kids and adults like water b-ball or water polo and then the winners would go up on stage at night before the show and the team would win Viva Shirts. The shows at night are SO exciting and good. The shows are like Grease, Chicago, Michael Jackson, Madonna...Excellent shows! After the shows, at night most of the teenagers and Animation Team go to the Disco. Also, certain nights there are competitions at the Disco where anybody can go in. I know that at this resort, everybody is a lot more involved in the activities, because I know a girl who went to another resort in Mexico and at that resort nobody did the activities during the day or went to the Disco at night. (They just lay on the beach all day) The staff there makes the resort way funner than you could imagine! They came and talked to us everyday and always offered to take us out at night to Playa Del Carmen. We stayed at the resort all days, except for 2 1/2 where our parents made us go one day on a Catamaran trip (It ended up to actually be really fun), shopping in Cancun (Not very good shopping for teenagers because there clothes are a lot different than ours) and one day we walked to Playa Del Carmen along the beach which was a really nice walk, but we ended up running back so we could make it back in time for the Dance Lessons. New Years was THE funnest time ever...HUGE party by the stage where everybody from the resort went to and everybody danced and drank all night. No matter how old you are, you will definitely have the best time ever at Viva Maya. There is a great Kids Club for the kids too. My parents had a really great time there also, and we are going back for Christmas 2005!!! Viva Maya is seriously the best place ever to go on vacation. The beach is beautiful with lots of things to go, like Para Sail (expensive and fun), Boogie Boarding, Banana Boat ($) sailing, snorkeling, everything! There are people from all over the world and everybody is so nice and friendly. So many good times I will never forget with the Animation Team and the people we met there.

Please bear with me...this is going to be kinda long. I want to touch on everything we experienced there. I took my 15 yr old daughter and my 6 yr old son. It had to be one of the best vacations we've had! The resort is fabulous! The animation staff is the best I have seen. The shows that they put on each night are incredible. Chicago and Alladin were spectacular. They are all very talented people. The kids club was perfect. My son loved the club. They took him to play tennis, archery, basketball,sand castle building,they went by bus to an aviary to see all the exotic birds. He had a marvelous time. There is always something going on during the day. They have darts, bingo, volleyball, salsa & meringue lessons, aerobics, water polo, bocci ball, beach games and all these activites were on a daily basis. The food was incredible. We never ate at the al a cartes because the buffet was always so good. They had so much selection that you couldn't try it all without being full before you finish. (And some would consider me a picky eater!). The rooms were NOT small. We had a poolside room on the bottom floor and it was perfect. The pools were great. The swim-up bar was fabulous. The beach was truly amazing! White powder sand and tourquoise waters. Absolute paradise. The staff...I can't say enough about the staff. They are amazing. They are so friendly and helpful. They work extremely hard to please their guests. The entire resort was scrubbed clean every single day and night. There is absolutely nothing I can complain about. The bartenders were fabulous. I brought canada hats for most of them and gifts for the chamber maids too. They were so incredibly friendly and made you feel like you never wanted to leave. We had absolutely no problem with anything at the resort during our stay. We tried to stay an extra week but unfortunately they were booked up for Easter so we had to come home. I miss it already. All the water sports are included (except the jet-skis) We took one of the sailboats out for an hour and it was a beautiful time. We went out on the kayaks and boogie boards and had fun in the waves. There were always enough lounge chairs to use. The palapas were usually taken by about 6:30 a.m., but as I am a sun person, this didn't bother me. I was usually on the beach by 8 anyway and we had the most beautiful weather you could ever imagine. It was sunny and hot every day we were there. We met wonderful people from both canada and usa. There are alot of europeans that don't speak much english but a smile goes a long way so we never had any problem with communication. We played alot of volleyball and met alot of people that way. Gestures work great! I really can't say enough about this resort. We will definately be going back to the Viva Maya. We took some of the staff's emails so we could keep in touch. They were awesome. We are planning a trip next year with a large group of friends and this resort is number one on the list. If you have any questions about this resort, feel free to email me and I will most definately email you back.

We stayed for 1 week, Feb 1 - Feb 8, 2004, 2 adults, and our two daughters, ages 7 and 11. The time share guys did not bother us, they approached us once, we said no thank you, and that was it. The beach is very nice, lots of lounge chairs, maybe too many, but can't complain about that. All the chairs gave the appearance of a crowded beach, but in fact it wasn't. Jesus took us on the hobie cat, he is awesome. All of the staff are very friendly. The rooms are slightly smaller than what you may be used to at home, as there is no sitting area, but the bathroom is big, and we only slept there, we were gone all day, from morning till night. We did not have a mini fridge in our room. We asked for one but was told none were available. In the end we really didn't miss it. Drinks are available all over the resort. Otherwise our room was fine, very clean and in good condition. Yes, the water in the bathroom is very hot, and yes, the pool area is very slippery. But, I just warned the kids the first day to be careful, and we never had a problem. Ok, if you're going on vacation for absolutely fabulous food, maybe this resort is not for you. (Personally, I was thankful I only gained 5 pounds that week. ) But the food is good, and lots of variety. I suggest you definitely try the a la carte restaurants. Portofinos, and the Italian at the sister hotel were good. My kids did not prefer the Mexican by the pool, but that was ok. Our reservation was early enough that after we were done we took them to the buffet to top up. We had no problem making a reservation, and no long line up. The bars were great. The coffee bar by the pool in the afternoon was excellent. My kids loved the ice cream machine open in the early afternoon for a couple of hours. Would be nice if both the coffee bar and ice cream machine could have been open a bit longer. We took the bikes to town. My husband took my 11 year old, no problems. One day I went by myself, a little nervous, a woman going to town alone, but no problems. The area seemed very safe. Bought some stuff, but didn't fine any real deals. Mall across the street from the hotel, very nice, and not more expensive than town. We had no problems with being sick. We brushed our teeth with the bottled water provided, none of us got sick at all. The evening shows could start a bit earlier. In summary, loved this resort.

My husband and I took our 16 year old twin girls and my 18 year old son and his 18 year old friend. We had a wonderful time. The staff couldn't have been friendlier and took a personal interest in the family. Several times a staff member came to where we were on the beach and offered to take the kids sailing and taught them to windsurf. They also taught them archery. The same staff members would meet us after the evening show and ask how we liked it and chat for a while. The grounds were immaculate with cleaning going on at all times. The beach was nice and deep and always clean. Staff came around and picked up cups and plates and would offer to get drinks. We were given rooms with an ocean view even though we paid for garden view. The rooms do need some updating. The lighting needs to be improved and ceilings repaired and painted. I believe this will happen now that Wyndham has joined the Viva, but will take time. There is only one outlet in the room- in the bathroom that is convenient for recharging batteries. The hair dryer provided worked well and we had mini refrigerators in our rooms. (We are Wyndham byRequest members so I don't know if everyone has these now). They did not put anything in them, but we were just steps from the beach bar so not a problem. We kept water bottles in them. They had an office type water cooler in the hall to refill bottles. We did not have a problem with the room as we looked at it as only a place to sleep, shower and change clothes. I liked the hard beds as they didn't move when someone turned over and were longer than normal beds. Showers were nice and hot with good water pressure. Tub didn't drain well but not a problem. The maid kept the room very clean and gave us towel art everyday. We had an elephant, dog, fan,dinosaur, armadillo, peacock, swans, and a beach bag towel art. The beach bar was convenient to beach and pool as was the snack bar. We ate at the snack bar at noon most days. Two days we went to the buffet for lunch. There was a large variety of food at the buffet each day. It changed for breakfast, lunch and dinner and each night there was a different theme. Of the ones I can remember were Asian, International, Mexican, tropical, and barbeque. I know I'm missing some. There was always pasta and chicken and beef. Plenty of fresh vegetables, fruit, salad, and desserts. The ala carte restaurants were great serving appetizers, soup, main course, and dessert. We were never hungry. We were allowed to sign up for the ala cartes for the week at the same time. There were choices for each course and we were given a drink before the meal. At the Mexican restaurant it was a blue margarita. The beach was fantastic white sand and large. Plenty of loungers. They were constantly pulling out broken ones and repairing them. The evening show was fun and well done. They immitated Michael Jackson, The show Grease, Cinderella, one night was game night, magician one night, and Mexican folk dancers. We were within walking distance of PDC, about 1/2 hour walk. Playacar plaza is just across the street from the entrance to the Viva Maya. Well worth the money for this resort. Not stuffy, but lots of fun with plenty of activities for all ages. Children were not a problem. They seemed to be at the pool most of the time.

There is also an iron and hairdryer. The beach was one of the best compared to others in the area with plenty of lounge chairs and thatched shade huts if you tag one early. People were snorkeling just off shore and seeing a variety of fish. If youre bored soaking up the sun, theres variety of things to do including, kayaking, sailing, volleyball, fitness and Latin dance classes. There are free bikes available for your trips to town. Although we didnt have children, we noticed the children and teens were having a great time enjoying special activities organized by the enthusiastic staff. The pool area was huge and well maintained and pool bar seemed to be busy from early AM to late night. The frosty, fruity drinks were great with Corona beer on tap. Good shows every night at the in house theatreSome people may have greater expectations than we do about the food and are just generally high maintenance folks but, for us, we found the meals to be good with a variety for all palates. We booked our specialty restaurant reservations the first morning we were there but after that a lot of people were complaining that they couldn't get reservations. We found this puzzling as we noticed several empty tables at each place we visited and it was obvious they could have accommodated more diners. \"Portofino\" was outstanding and we did try \"La Scala\" at the Viva Azteca, which was also great. The Mexican restaurant was good but we thought the others superior. The main dining room offered a lot of choices. The usual entr?es offered local fish, pork, chicken, turkey and beef (this was best if it was in a stew form.) Everyday there was a special Mexican dish along with the usual burritos, pizza, hot dogs, etc. Also, they make omelets and pasta to order. Because we had been so sick in Dom. Rep. we didn't try the fresh veggies & fruit until the last few days and what a treat...soooo good. AND more importantly we didn't get sick!Most tours sold by TNT as well as the hotel were pricing from $75 and were available only on specific days so we did a lot of traveling/touring on our own using public transportation. The public busses and vans were air-conditioned, VERY inexpensive, and maintained a regular schedule. The area is very safe so we walked from the hotel to Playa Del Carmen where we found many time-share condo vendors as well as travel agencies selling tours that offer the same venue as the hotels at much lower costs. It is not necessary to buy a time-share and/or visit the condo sites to take advantage of the tours but if you do wish to, the tours are free. TNT and Viva tours to Tulum were pricing from $75 and didnt offer us the time flexibility we wanted. So we took a taxi into Playa Del Carmen (3 mi) for $4, took a van (12 people) for $3 each (approx 45-50mi) to Tulum. From the bust stop off the main road we walked a short distant to the ruin site and paid an entrance fee $4 each (guides are available there. We leisurely toured the ruins, enjoyed our picnic lunch and the afternoon on the beautiful beach at the base of the cliffs below El Castillo. We paid $2 each to return on a bus to Play Del Car and a $4 cab back to the hotel...just $13 each for a very memorable and relaxing day. Chichen Itza and Coba are indirect routes located a greater distance from the Riviera Maya. Therefore, tours are more costly starting at $85 per person. For a few pesos you could take a van or bus to Tulum and make a connection to either place from there but we found a fair priced tour service at a (time-share) kiosk across the street from Carlos & Charlies (ask for Carlos Mendez). He arranged a van and guide to pick us up at our hotel for the trip to Chichen Itza (2 3/4-3hrs 1-way). We had another guide at the ruin site, a buffet lunch, entertainment/native dancers, a visit to a refreshing ceynote, stopped in the old city of (?) and returned to our hotel for $45 each for a 8:30A-8P day! Another day we shared a cab from the hotel to Coba (approx 2hrs 1-way for $38 each (the driver waited for us). There is a $4 entrance fee to the site. English speaking guides were available for group tours starting from $25. If you have a good map and with reference guide you can tour at your own pace. We recommend renting the bicycles available for 75 cents as the Coba ruins are spread our over a very large site, pack bottled water, and wear comfortable walking shoes, cool clothing and a hat for protection from the hot sun. Our driver was waiting to return us to the hotel by 3:30P. As for shopping- we didn't find any terrific bargains. All the shops had the same tourist souvenir stock and the better shops were as pricey as the US. If you get away from the resort area...the prices are less but still the same variety. The small mall near the hotel offered a good variety of shops. The telephone system is a hassle. None of our phone credit cards would work (prepaid or otherwise) except from the hotel for a $5 connection charge. We bought a TelMex phone card for $5 at a pharmacy. There are specific phone booths for the use of these cards which we found across the street from the hotel in the shopping center. We lost most of our prepaid phone card calling time trying to figure out how the card worked.Riviera Maya offers a great deal more to see and do so we look forward to returning.

Overall we had a great time after we got over our intial disappointment. As one of the reviewer suggested, first impression is very important and also a lasting one. When we first checked into our room, we were very disappointed that it was quite small for a family of 4. The lighting was very dim in the room and the bathroom was dark. The room decor requires updating. It did not look or feel like a hotel room, it looked like someone just painted everything with house paint on everything. On to the light fixture, night table, and the dresser table. Don't get me wrong, the room was clean so that is important. Both queen size beds were very hard. The matress layed on top of a slab of concrete, not a box spring underneath. It seems I wasn't the only one complaining about the bed as I heard another customer trying to switch room because of it. I too also tried switching room after the first night but was told that all the beds were the same and the room size were the same by the Front Desk. Therefore, I left it as it. Now on to the bathroom. The faucet's chromes were so worn down that the shine were no longer on it. Our bathtub had a 5 inch crack in it so we needed to watch that crack wasn't going to pinch the bottom of our feet. Quite a few of the towels needed to be replaced as they were fraying on the edges. There was only 1 electrical outlet in the whole hotel room and that was in the bathroom. So for anyone who needs to charge more than one item of these: camera, camcorder, shaver, curling iron, electric toothbrush, laptop, or whatever, then they will find it very annoying. Since the lighting in the bathroom was so dim, anyone needing to look in the mirror to put on contact lens or makeup will find it hard to see. After 2 days, we got over the intial disappointment and just adjusted to the room. Everything else about the resort was great. Definately the best beach front compare to the other hotels along the same beach. The size, the cleanliness, the maintenace of the whole beach area was super. I saw other beaches had a lot of cigarette butts, plastic drinking cups and straws lying in the sand. While at the Viva Maya, there's staff picking up all the drinking cups throughout the day. There's even staff coming on the beach to offer cold drinks and watermelon to the guests to quench our thirst from the hot sun. It was the best beach setup with lots of huts and palm trees providing shades while most other hotels left you to bake all day in the sun. Even the 5 star hotels didn't have the same well thought out layout of the beach front that the Viva Maya had. The pools could have been larger but then I guess most guests were happy swimming in the beach. There were plenty of beach chairs and towels available. Outdoor activities were provided and was going on all day. They were put on by the friendly and enthusiastic \"Activity\" staff. They truly looked happy at their job because they really enjoyed having fun with the guests. These same \"Activity Staff\" put on a great amatuer show nightly that was very entertaining...even to my teens. I found all the staff, ranging from the food & beverage staff, cleaning, secruity, landscaping, and the other hotel staff to be quite friendly. For most part, they were quite helpful. Although, it's expected that quite a few of the staff didn't speak any english or very limited amount. But as long as you took the time to speak slowly or somehow communicate your point, they were more than happy to help. The food was great compared to the other resorts that we've stayed in the Carribean. A large variety to choose from at the buffet for all 3 meals in the Terraza restaurant. Even the buffet spread down by the pool area was great. We had lunch and snacks there most of the time. My kids loved both areas of eating so much that they didn't even wanted us to reserve eating at one of the restarants which you could order off a menu. My husband and I both agree with the kids. It was way too much fun to choose, pick, and then sample all the different variety of food that was available. For a change, there was a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables offered at every meal. Where we've been to other resorts and they only served frozen vegetables. Excellent fresh pineapples! Mmm....and the large assortment that was available at the dessert cart! I would have to say the food just topped it off for us. Our family really felt we got good value for our money. Mind you it was a last minute booking so we did get a deal.

The Food is ok, 7 days at the buffet gets to you. The specialty restaurants are good, but difficult to get into (you need reservations).

We were on the ground floor in a garden view room and were very satisfied, though the little patios could be bigger. There is a nice pool area and the best beach of any of the hotels in the area. There is always something going on around the pool area. The young multi-national activities staff work incredibly hard to keep you entertained all day and evening. There is always something going on; boccia ball, volley ball, darts, games for the kids, water aerobics, dance classes, bingo etc. Don't get the idea that they are obtrusive, they're not. The staff walks the beach and announces what is coming up next. If you want to join inyou do, if not you relax on the super beach. There are two restaurants besides the main buffet restaurant. One at the pool, (good burgers, nachos, pizza, etc. for lunch), which serves Mexican dishes and another Mediterranean style. Both require advance reservations and both were excellant. I suggest you make your reservations for them on the day you arrive. They are a nice change of pace from the buffet. Speaking of the buffet, if you can not find soething you like there you are just way too picky an eater. All the food was of very good quality. As with all buffets there were occassional instances where they ran out of things, but the staff was very quick to refill, even without it being pointted out to them. We also ate at the Japenese themed restaurant at the Viva Azteca down the street. It too was great and there was no extra charge. By the way, the Viva Azteca seemed to be a much more sedate place than the Maya. On our visit there it did not seem like people were having much fun. We tried scuba diving, snorkeling and catamaran sailing. All except the scuba is included. The initial try out of scuba is free and then you pay for the type of course, (certification vs. resort dive packages), you want. The staff at the scuba shop is top notch and the dives and snorkelling trips are well worth it. The evening shows by the young Activities Staff were fun. A different show every night on the big stage by the pool. Mostly lip sinking and enthusiastic dancing to popular shows like Madonna, Chicago and Aladdin. It's not Las Vegas, but is certainly entertaining. I must mention that in the bar adjacent to the check in area a terrific guitar player entertained most every night and that and the adjacent open air courtyard were nice places to hang out if you did not want to go to the show. The one negative I can say about the resort is that the tiles around the pool get VERY slippery when wet. You have to be very careful walking there with bare feet. We spent most all our time on the beach though, so it was not a big issue. You really cannot go wrong with a vacation here. We would go back in a heartbeat.", "Date": "March 1, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Manitoba", "Title": "\u201cGreat Family Vacation Value\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1664872", "Content": "Just returned from 2 weeks at Viva Maya with my family (kids ages 12 and 9) and had a wonderful time. We found lots to do and pretty much tried everything there was to offer (tennis, archery, bocci, beach volleyball, ping-pong, catamaran sailing, boogie boarding, aerobics, bingo, Spanish lessons, scuba lessons in the pool, water polo, bike riding, kids club activities, not to mention numerous trips to the swim up bar) Staff were especially friendly and helpful. We can't say enough good things about them. If you play tennis, or even if you don't, Jesus gives great lessons with much patience and great sense of humour. He, as well as Jann and Joanne at archery/watersports, helped make our stay a lot of fun. Room accommodations are modest (perhaps due for some renovation soon) but were always clean, as was the entire complex. Food was pretty good, better than I was expecting as our last couple of trips had been cruises with fabulous food. Purified water is provided - we all had one day of feeling a bit queasy but other than that all went well. Our 9 year old spent some time with the kids club and enjoyed it. However, one gap in the resort's programming is the lack of organized activities for the pre-teen/teen group. The kids club activities were fine for those up to about 10 years of age and there were numerous adult tournaments but the 11-16 group is forgotten about. Jann was kind enough to go above and beyond the call of duty by taking a group of the boys out sailing for an hour and organizing an impromptu archery competition shortly after. Took one tour (Tulum and Xel-Ha combo). Pretty good but very expensive, as are all the tours. Better to arrange your own cab ride and pay the gate fees as we did when we went to Xcaret, which was very nice. Overall, great value for a family vacation and we would return in a minute.

Since I spent the week before in Cancun I needed a transfer from Playa del Carmen. I emailed the hotel in advance and they arranged for the transfer. I was pleasantly surprised when a car service showed up at the appointed hour and took me to Viva Maya. This was the start of a lovely vacation. Once at the Viva Maya, check in was very quick and the staff was very pleasant. There was even a welcome sign at the check-in desk welcoming me and other RCI timeshare guests. During check in they served welcome drinks. This hotel is great for everyone - families, couples, singles. The majority of the guests are European - mostly Italians, German and French and a few British - so there's some topless bathing. There are only a handful of Americans and some Canadians. However, there are many staff who speak the various languages so you won't have a problem communicating with the staff. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. The grounds of the hotel are attractive and well kept, with lots of greenery. The hotel has a long stretch of beach. The beach and sea are gorgeous. There are plenty of beach chairs. You can relax in peace reading a book or join in beach volley ball or other free water sports. There's only one pool (a few yards from the beach) but this seemed adequate since most people were on the beach. I stayed in a studio. Although it wasn't plush it was comfortable and very clean and I had a wonderful view of the ocean. It included a King Size bed, dining table with four chairs, fully-stocked kitchen, tv, iron/ironing board and safe and patio with a table and two chairs. On my first day there I received a wonderful surprise. One of the staff delivered a welcome package that included a bottle of wine, a fruit plate, sodas, beer and water. Thereafter, I noticed that the hotel restocked my fridge with these items as I used them. I guess this was part of the all inclusive package. The hotel has three main restaurants - 1) international that serves buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner and two speciality restaurants (mexican and mediterranean cuisine). You have to make reservations for the specialty restaurants. If you're interested in these as about the reservation process when you check in because they get booked quickly. I ate my meals at the international restaurant because they always had so much variety that there was always something that I could eat. While the food was not great, it was fine and I have no complaints. For New Year's they had an even bigger spread than normal and also served champagne. There's also a snack bar by the beach, if you don't want to walk up to the restaurants when you're at the beach. You can also eat at a couple of the restaurants of the Viva Maya's sister hotel, Viva Azteca. Reservations are required. You don't have to worry about drinking the water at the hotel. All of the water is distilled. The hotel also provides bottled water and you can fill up your empty bottles at the water coolers that they have on every floor and at the beach bar. The hotel does its best to entertain the guests. There are many activities going on during the day including the ever popular Salsa/Merengue dancing classes, various games in the pool, bingo, etc. The hotel staff seemed to do an especially good job with the children. Every evening the hotel would include two types of entertainment. During the happy/early dinner hour there would some kind of theme based entertainment (in the square just before the reception area) that they would engage guests in -- the Casbah with magicians doing magic tricks, rodeo theme with cowboys roping steer/other staff, 50's dancing. Every night the hotel would put on a show (staff were the entertainers) at around 9:30. I didn't see any of these but the guests who went seemed to like them. The Viva Maya is in a great location in Playacar. The Playacar shopping center is a few minutes walk down the street from the hotel. There you can buy all of your souvenirs, book tours and get cash from the cashpoint machine (I thin you get a better rate than exchanging money at the hotel desk). My recommendation is to book your trips at the travel agency in the Playacar shopping center rather than at the hotel. After talking to guests at other hotels, it seems that all of the hotels charge about 20% more than if you book at the travel agency. The travel agency is across the street from the hotel next to the cash point machine. If you want to go into town it's about a 10 minute taxi ride ($4 from the hotel). There's a mall in town that offers a variety of things to buy. There are also clubs, restaurants and bars in town if you want to get out of the hotel for the evening. Overall, I had a wonderful stay at the Viva Maya and would highly recommend it.

HOTEL-It is not as great as any other neighboring hotels such as RIU Palace. It looked as if any motel type with some Mexican flavor. FOOD - Food is great. We preferred Buffet because we can always find good foods for my children. VIVA Mexico is excellent! Portofino, the mediterinian restaurant is just average. ROOM - So so size and interior but with some quality. I think is is not bad room. ACTIVITY - This is great. I give 10/10 for this. The night show is is great. There are some people who understands quality show. Especially they are good at all kinds of dancing. Dancing mixed with music made great atmosphere. I believe they spent some money and time to prepare that. EXCURSION - we rented a car and drove to ChiChen-ITZA. It took 3 hours and we went there via Coba, Chemex, route 180, Valladolid, Kaua. As we did not use highway from Cancun, we have saved about 60$ for toll. We payed 137$/day for a minivan with full insurance. Xel-Ha is good but not for young children who cannot swim. For young kids less than 8, go to Xcaret. Xel-Ha is designed mainly for adults. TIPS - For dinner, you should book before. At 8:00 am, go to guest service desk and book your dinner for the week. Don't forget that the sister restaurants at Hotel Viva Azteca allows very limited guests from Viva Maya. So, make reservation 2 or 3 days before your scheduled date. The reservations are worthewhile. To save money at Xel-Ha, take your own snorkling gear. Food there is poor. Bring also your lunch with water. Buy only entrance fee then you can enjoy everything inside.

We chose the hotel because we were bringing our 2 year old and 5 year old with us and we wanted someplace where they would have fun. My opinion is that the Viva Maya deserves its 4 star reputation but it could have done a lot better with just a few changes. The rooms were small, which we knew about ahead of time. They were clean though and had plenty of hot water. A little better decorating and some more anemities would certainly help their rating. We could see the ocean from our balcony even though we didn't pay for a ocean view. The total layout of the hotel was nice with open hallways and covered paths to the restaurants. Our rooms were convenient to the beach and the pool and the restaurants. They also were very quiet. The buffet food was good and had a lot of variety. No shellfish though, except on New Year's Eve. You usually had to wait in line for the popular items but at least they were freshly cooked. The two restaurants were not worth the wait in line for reservations. The food was okay, but no better than the buffets and the service was not good. The snack bar near the pool was great. The bartenders were the hardest working people in the hotel and made excellent, strong drinks. Their blenders were constantly busy. The couldn't make a cosmopolitan, but they made excellent frozen drinks. The bar in the interior was better than the pool bar. Good coffee bar. The pool area was kept clean but was extremely slippery. I slipped once, and my children were constantly slipping. For some reason the jacuzzi is not heated. Basically it is a kiddy pool with bubbles. Heating it and keeping the kids away would have been a nice break for the adults in the evening hours. The poolside bathrooms were kept clean and dry. The beach was great. Plenty of lounge chairs. The surf on their beach seemed a little stronger than the hotels further East and the beach was flatter. Some of the hotels had very steep beaches. You could see the sandbags they used in the ocean for erosion purposes. Perhaps they were used for this reason? They obviously cleaned the beach every night. The shows were entertaining but started too late for my children. They tried to get my older child to go to the kid's club (one girl who worked their flirted and kissed my son every day) but since the kid's club seemed to not go swimming or go to the beach, he was not interested. We used a babysitter one day -$10 an hour. The children were happy with her. I read a lot about how friendly the staff were at the Viva. Some were extremely good, but a lot seemed to have attitudes.

I would have liked to have seen a bit more seafood, but alas... the menus had lots of variety, and the restaurants were scrupulously clean and well managed. The bar line ups were busier than they needed to be, thanks to smallish glasses, but, no big deal. Just order 2 drinks at a time. Most of the large, modern rooms have a very nice courtyard view, with a small handful of unlucky guests looking onto an adjacent hotel complex, still, not too bad. There can be some climbing of stairs involved, but with the good food available, there should be no problem of \"wasting away\". The pamphlet we saw said there was a mini-bar in the room. If it was there, we couldn't find it, but bottled water was provided, as well as a water cooler to refill bottles from, just one floor below us. The hotel is situated within a reasonable walking distance to town, with plenty to see and do along the way. It's amazing to see paths meandering around ruins, just steps off the roadway. The town and the weather left me with a fantasy of just chucking it all to tend bar there. How many bartenders do they need in Playa del Carmen, anyway? (sigh) A word of advice though...don't lose a hotel key when you're boogie boarding in the surf. From the price they charge for a lost key, I'm guessing that they're hand hewn from some sort of very exotic ore. You'll enjoy yourself at this resort!", "Date": "October 27, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, WI", "Title": "\u201cExceeded all expectations\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1397837", "Content": "My fiance and I stayed at Viva Maya from October 11-16, and were very impressed with the facilities at Viva Maya. After reading other reviews on tripadvisor.com, I was expecting a mediocre hotel, but wasn't too worried since we had plans to take several day trips away from the hotel. I couldn't have been more wrong. The hotel was fantastic! Granted, it's not the biggest one in Playacar, but it was just the right size for us. The rooms had 2 double beds and a balcony. The maid service folded our towels into decorative fans or animals everyday, and the kleenex and toilet paper were also folded into fans. The minibar is actually a bucket for ice and 2 bottles of water everyday, but the bar is a short walk away. The air conditioning worked great, and we had a nice view of the gardens from our second floor balcony. The beds were firm, but felt good on our tired backs. The staff were VERY friendly. We quickly made friends with the bar tenders who always remembered our favorite drinks, and the rest of the staff always said \"hola!\". The food was AMAZING!! The buffet was great. Sure, they have a lot of the same foods from day to day, but the variety is such that you can't possibly eat everything you want to in one sitting. Also, the foods that do change are always amazing. The barbacoa beef they served during their Mexican theme night was one of the best foods I've ever eaten. The Viva Mexico restaurant always had snacks around the pool during the day and turned into an ala carte restaurant for dinner. The dishes were delicious, and the margarita glasses were NEVER empty. Portofino was also fantastic. The seafood dishes were amazing. I had mahi-mahi and my fiance had a dish with fish and squid in a cream-based sauce. I also recommend the salmon and ricotta stuffed homeade ravioli in lobster sauce as an appetizer. YUM!! My fiance proposed to me at this restaurant! The staff were all in on it and took lots of pictures with our camera and gave us celebratory shots of tequilla. The attention to detail at this hotel by the staff was at a level I've never experienced. Actually, it is that way everywhere in Play del Carmen. Tourism is the only industry in that area, so everyone takes there jobs very seriously. The waiters brush the crumbs off the tables when you're done eating, and there is a person whose job is to go around sweeping leaves off the sidewalks. The beach at Viva Maya is clean and beautiful. There are always PLENTY of lounge chairs available either in or out of the shade. I also recommend taking day trips. We bought our Amstar tours through Apple vacations. The Coba trip with the visit to the Mayan village was fantastic! Our tour guide Sophie was very knowledgable and fun! I HIGHLY recommend this trip. We also took the Golden Cruise to Isla Majores to the Dolphin Discovery. It's a beautiful cruise (open bar and food included). The staff is A LOT of fun!! Dolphin Discovery was a lot of fun, too. You can swim with the dolphins, snorkel with manta rays, and snorkel outside of a shark tank. All the animals are in pens within the ocean, so they are in their natural environment. It's absolutely beautiful!! Chichen Itza was a great trip, too, but the ruins are far more commercialized than Coba. Coba still has a small village living near the ruins, whereas Chichen Itza has a flea market, museum, and gift shop. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend vacationing to this area and staying at Viva Maya. You can do everything by visiting Cozumel, Mayan ruins, etc., or you can do nothing and just enjoy the sun, the beach, and all the great food! Either way you will not be disappointed. Enjoy your trip!

The food at the buffet is obviously prepared with care and is well presented -- and it tastes fine (we often enjoy the customized pasta sauce as part of our evening meal). The rooms are adequate and clean (give the maid a buck a day for the extra effort of folding your towels into a diff. animal each day, some extra bottled water & just to be a nice tourist). The beach is cool soft white sand. Add sunshine, warm breezes and a view of Cozumel in the distance, dotted by the frequent cruise ships that stop there. Walking the long stretch of beach past other hotels and into an undeveloped area can be fun (occasional sightings of military-type guys with guns made us feel safe from any would-be robbers). We also observed that the beach at resort itself is patrolled by staff at night (sleep better). The fresh water pool is often in use (despite the natural ocean water being only 50 yards away) as is the adjacent outdoor hot tub. The pool and hot tub are clean, as is the beach and the entire resort for that matter (numerous staff are continually cleaning up after the guests). There's activities galore at the VM for those who want them, and some shady palapas for those who rest and read (but if you really want one, don't sleep in; or else wait until late afternoon when some become vacated). The bar service is good (no tip required, but they seem to appreciate a buck now and again). Different nightly shows range from O.K. to spectacular (cast is some of the same crew that run the daytime activities). Small shopping mall across the street provides a destination for an occasional evening walk. Playa del Carmen is either a good hike, easy bike ride or a $5 U.S. cab each way. It's lively and full of merchants/salespeople, so learn to smile and keep walking. Recommend buying a two-way ticket at the kiosk near the dock for the ferry to take you to Cozumel for a few hours. Dress is relaxed/casual, even topless on the beach for those who wish. All tolled, a carefree and relaxing vacation spot.", "Date": "October 17, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Viva Wyndham Maya", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d185330-Reviews-Viva_Wyndham_Maya-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$151 - $242*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Paseo Xaman-Ha, Mza.
