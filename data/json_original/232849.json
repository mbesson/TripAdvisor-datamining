There is no doubt that this is a hotel that is in many ways a stunning representation of history. The 500 year old Chapel in the hotel is stunningly beautiful and the large common lounge area is classic and elegant. Whilst my room was small, it was cosy, and was certainly enough for a weary traveller and the bed was comfortable. A big sash style window could be opened for fresh air and this was a real plus. The courtyard below my window was charming. However, with history comes age and this was evident in some of the 'cover up' refurbishment done in the rooms. The ceilings in my room had signs of mould and the bath needed replacing as did the clean but aged basin. I did not use the air conditioning because I felt the mould was probably through the filters there as well. Like many European hotels, there was no iron in the room and I had to share the iron and ironing board with the whole hotel. The staff had no idea where the iron was once it was borrowed. Whilst the staff were friendly enough, they were quite reserved and when I got caught in the tiny lift for over half an hour with 5 other people they refused to open up another entry with a stairwell for us to use because they said it was a security risk. To be fair, this was probably true, but this meant that the tiny lifts were overcrowded constantly and I lived in fear of another 'trapped' episode throughout my stay. The hotel is oddly converted into a maze of floors that did not seem to follow logic and one never quite knew where some of the rooms were - numbers that should have followed a logical sequence did not and I ended up completely lost looking for colleagues a number of times. Breakfast was reasonably good but the dinner we had provided for our group was poor to say the least. Staff were not always warm or welcoming in the breakfast room or dining room either. One plus is the position which is without a doubt fantastic and within walking distance of everything I needed. Would I stay there again? Possibly but would like to see some serious renovation work done in places.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stavanger, Norway", "Title": "\u201cNice place\u201d", "Author": "JanB000", "ReviewID": "UR120204407", "Content": "Nice and clean room with qute large bathroom.

I didn't actually review this hotel, or book it - I booked Hotel Saturnia instead, which overall is ranked a lot higher that Antico Palazzo Rospigliosi. However, after arriving at Hotel Saturnia it was so incredibly bad that we decided to give up the 388 Euros we prepaid and find something else (it was our honeymoon and my wife literally sat down on the bed and cried at Saturnia, and her last visit to Italy she stayed in hostels - what does that say!). About two blocks away we found Antico Palazzo Rospigliosi. We asked if they had a room available and they said yes, we asked if it had air conditioning - yes, toilet - yes, windows - yes, so already it was better than Saturnia. We asked if we could see it - yes. We were blown away! Now, I've stayed in much more upscale hotels around the world, but I've also stayed in far worse - but what surprised me was that this was basically the same price per night as Saturnia but it was 10 times better. Our room was one of the larger rooms we stayed in during our trip (stayed in 5 hotels, not including Saturnia), it was clean and given we overlooked the square with a busy road it was very quiet. Breakfast was decent, eggs (never had a problem getting any as one reviewer wrote, but I did find that sometime the warmer flame would be out so they wouldn't be that warm), cheese, meats, pastries, etc. The best part was that you could ask them to make you a latte or cappuccino. The clerks were very friendly and gave us great restaurant recommendations and directions (they did give us wrong information about their laundry service being open on Sunday, but it worked out even better for us as they ended up sending us to a place that did our laundry for a fraction of the price). I only can complain about one thing - we wanted fresh towels so we through them on the floor in the bathroom expecting they'd give us clean ones but they picked them up and put them back on the towel racks! If it weren't for that, and if the breakfast had been a little better I would have given it 5 stars. One note about the air conditioning and the lights, something I hadn't seen before but did see again in Venice and that is you have to have your room key card (although I was told by a friend later you can stick anything in that fits) in a slot to keep the lights and air conditioning on - and the air conditioning is set at 25C, which is a little warm but reasonable I think. Also, they have free parking (but limited spaces) around the corner. They will tell you that there is no security and to be honest I was a little worried. But we parked a BMW there for 3 nights over a weekend and had no problems. If anyone has stayed in this hotel and found a better hotel in ancient Rome in the same price range I'd love to hear from you.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cmixed feelings\u201d", "Author": "gameshow", "ReviewID": "UR116827508", "Content": "If there is one thing about this sight. it is that there are so many different reviews. I am glad that I didn't read them before I stayed here because I would have been very wary of this place. I can only tell you my feelings and as the title says they were mixed. To begin with, I was with a tour so I didn't pick this hotel. We all arrived in the morning and none of the rooms were ready. I had guessed that since it was morning and we all were arriving around 8AM that they would not be ready. OK, but the lobby (waiting room) was tiny and with the whole group along with all our luggage, well, that leaves very little room. Once we were settled (sometime in the afternoon) my room was on the first floor accessed by a very tiny elevator, then I could appreciate the hotel better. The room was small but adequate and the bath was decent except the shower was so small I could barely turn around and I am not a large person. Our room was overlooking an alley so there was really no noise from the main street which was only a few feet away. The hotel itself was charming and I was told was over 500 years old and belonged at one time to a Cardinal. It had a beautiful church in it and being this was a Catholic tour we had Mass every morning. Breakfast was disappointing as every morning when I arrived, there were no more eggs. I shouldn't have to be the first one there to be served. By the time more eggs were served it was time for the tour to leave. As I've stated, I liked many things about this hotel especially the location, but there were other issues which made for a stay which could have been superior, but left me wanting more.

We found them to be very helpful and friendly, our room was not ready when we arrived from the airport but they took charge of our luggage so we could start our Roman visits (2 days before starting our cruise). Our bags were in our room on return, but be aware the lift is narrow so egress can be fun when checking out. We had a family room (210) overlooking the square and found the hotel was just as advertised by our holiday advisor. It was clean, quiet and air-conditioned, just what was needed to rest after a busy day's activities in Rome. Large double bed for us and a good sized single for our daughter. The bathroom had been 'tarted up' and the shower now has a glass door with lots of hot water - all signs of age or mould has been sorted out so very acceptable for the price. The tour bus stopped just outside, perfect to 'do Rome' in a few hours, and Termini is 5/10 minute walk depending on how fit you are. We are fit but could'nt be bothered to walk early on a Sunday morning and got a taxi just outside. The church in the square is worth a look after a day touring Rome and before you sit down outside for your first beer. As previously mentioned, breakfast is a bit hit or miss, its Continental, so dont expect eggs 'over easy', just hot coffee and tea, croissants and scrambled eggs with some meat of unidentified origin!. Hey..when in Rome..! There is a small shop/store nearby where you can get water and drinks incl soda and wine/beer to take back to your room. On the first floor there is access to a lovely garden - the hotel does have an interesting history, which we were surprised to find mainly unused in the evening. We brought our store purchased drinks out there late in the cool evening to enjoy over a chat/cigar! The hotel does have a bar but as this is Rome there was nobody around to get you one so what the hell..our option was cheaper; the room has a mini bar we used to cool our drinks..and a safe. I can very highly recommend La Carbonnara and especially Antica Trattoria A Monti resturants (both on Via Panisperna 48 (google them) a pleasant 10 minute walk away from the tourist traps nearby..lovely food, very Italian, very popular, about 50 euro for 3 adult 3 course meals, soda, bottled water, bread, beer and a 1L carafe of house red..most acceptable, as is the walk back in the cool evening..window and people watching..across the narrow street from the Trattoria was a fascinating resturant/bar we would have loved to visit but didnt have the time..the whole place is covered in green foliage..great to sit and watch!

The breakfast area is small and the number of staff inadequate consequently the service available is not 4 star. The charge for WiFi usage is an absurd \u20ac25/day. The hotel opened as a 4 star plus in 2005 but the owners have shut the reception area and transferred reception to the original small group check-in area on the ground floor. The retaurant and bar were shut during our stay in May 2010. During the day there was one person on the front desk and a porter/waiter. The quality of the staff is good.

You had to take an elevator which was small and very slow. The staff was pretty nice but when we returned to Rome to stay the second time they downgraded our room from a quad to a triple due to the fact that \"we only had three people\" even though I paid for a quad room to ensure some extra space. They refused to refund a portion of the $300 a night rate to accommodate the downgrade and wouldn't move us to another room.

Second room not much better, third time lucky. We ended up with 301 which was opposite Santa Maria Maggiore church with lovely view. Nice size, but bathroom still a little shabby nowhere to put toiletries, slightly chipped bath and shower on cradle on bath taps. We settled here as best of rest. Breakfast was awful. Cold eggs and frankfurters, one style of bread roll, croissant (if you are lucky) and packet toast. Cheese in plastic and silver foil. However, if you don't mind a salami roll, standard tub of yogurt and coffee its adequate. Juice was squash. There is NO bar or restaurant even though in the room there is a sign which invites you to go the bar. At the back of the courtyard there is a restaurant that must have been sold off and is now nothing to do with the hotel.

We went out early morning and spent the day and evening out returning late for a relaxing bath and bed. For this reason the hotel was suitable. We did not want to waste money on a hotel that we were not spending much time in. If you get this hotel at a good price and dont want to spend time other than in your room, it is a good choice. Not really 4*. There is a nice looking restaurant on the corner (didnt have time to go there) and a really good restaurant with fantastic atmosphere on the Via Cavour ,sorry forgot name but specialised in chicken as well as usual Italian delights (fairy lights outside) the spit cooked chicken was excellent and the Italian Owner gave us a selection of Italian starters.

The driving in Italy was crazy and we were glad to return the car!!!! The train station is a short 7 minute walk. We purchased our tickets the day before and simply walked onto the express train in the morning of our flight. This was the way to do it! No fuss or car return problems. Avis was great as there is no fee for returning the car to another location. I found this a grand hotel. It is nicely decorated and we appreciated the free internet access. Breakfast was quite suitable. We were looking for a triple room (traveling with our 21 year old daughter) and this was a very good deal. Our room was on the courtyard and was very quiet. We had a \"stay for 3 and pay for 2\" deal, so it equalled out to about 130 Euros a night. This was a good deal for Rome in August. We ate at some lovely places within walking distance. The hotel staff was helpful and especially the staff on the main door.

This was lovely and very quite. We had friends that had 2 rooms looking out at the Basillica on the street and it was a little more noisy (but they sleep with the windows open). Room: Nice size. The beds very comfortable. We had a full length mirror but my kids did not (not a problem for us). We had a bathtub with a hand spray which I thought may be a problem, but we loved it. The spray was hot and strong. My kids had a shower. The bathrooms were a nice size and there were some shampoo ammeneties and a small bar of soap there (I also brought a bar for the shower). I bring my own shampoo everywhere too. There is a toilet and bidet (could not get the hang of this...I am too American I guess!). There is TV with CNN international and bbc world in english and my kids loved MTV which has Italian commentary but they do not dub over the stars comments and songs. There is a refrigerator with waters, soda (cans), juice and wine. We bought waters and sodas (plastic bottles) and stored some in the frig and it was not a problem so we were not charged for waters, etc. There is a hanging closet and a small draw. The storage was enough for me and half of hubbies (he kept extra stuff in the suitcase on the luggage tray). My kids kept stuff in their suitcases because there was not alot of storage room in the room and they tend to do this anyway at many hotels. They are teens, so I let them manage their own clothes. The rooms are not adjoining, but that was not a problem for us. The windows have shutters that close and keep it dark if you want to sleep a little late one day. Overall, very comfortalbe. Breakfast: nice continental breakfast. The friendly staff make you a cappuccino or expresso. There is regular coffee, hot tea, hot milk and cold milk, cereals, muffins, crackers, pastries, hot weiners, cheese and salami and ham, hard boiled eggs, fruit (pineapple or peaches) and yogurts each day. The rooms is cheery the table has linens and plates have charger plates underneath, so it is very lovely. Staff: Very friendly and helpful. Gave us directions when we wanted and always responded to my emails prior to my stay. Hotel: there is several sitting areas (including one off the lobby for meeting friends) and a library (very nice) and computer with internet connection for free. The hotel seems to attract a European crowd since it does not advertise in most USA internet sites I have used. It was family friendly and 3 blocks from the Termini. There is also a taxi stand across the street and many buses go by. The open bus stops there too. There is SMA (supermarket) across the piazza and a UPIM (department store) too. Make sure you stop by the coffee shop next door for an afternoon latte. Phillip was very friendly and said hello to us each day. My girls thought he was attractive too! Overall: We loved the stay!
