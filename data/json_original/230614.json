For those that don't know a residence in Italy is like a serviced apartment not a hotel - so you get a bedroom, sitting room and kitchen or kitchenette with maid service each day but don't expect a restaurant on site or pools and so forth - I think one or two of the negative reviews here reflect a lack of understanding as to what the place is... The rooms are clean and have nice views and the Penthouse especially has great views through 360 degrees, water is always hot, linen always clean and the decor might best be described as classic italian (a shabby chic) everything you need is in the rooms (I've stayed many times over the last 8 years and never found a room with no mirrors or places to put luggage as one reviewer suggested) and there are nice Bang Olufsen tv's etc and fast ethernet broadband in every room The staff are very helpful and will look after cases for you, arrange transport, even do laundry etc like a hotel. You get a room key and front door key so you can come and go as you please at all hours though there is a night porter on duty if needed. The hotel is also a modern art gallery with some interesting and diverting pieces around. Its situated close to all the touristy parts of Rome and there is a metro and a taxi rank opposite and a few doors up from the best coffee shop in Rome (Pepey's) The rooms are no the cheapest available but not expensive by Rome standards and what you get is a suite with kitchen and a double sofa bed in the lounge so you could sleep a whole family in the one room rather than just a couple. For a romantic stay then the penthouse with twin patios for private sunbathing is ideal. I've stayed in Rome many times including lovely hotels like the Westin and the Parco de Principei but this is the only place I always go back to now I've found it.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location , location\u201d", "Author": "forevercurious007", "ReviewID": "UR117001484", "Content": "The hotel is centrally located literally 2 minutes from the Barberini piazza.

There's no sign, only a brass logo beside the door and the numbers \"171\" to show the street address. It appears to have been a small apartment building at one time and they've converted each of the two suites per floor into a hotel room. I would guess there's no more than 12 rooms in the hotel. There is no restaurant and the lobby consists of a small desk, staffed by one person, and a sofa. There is a bellman during the day but at night, the entrance door is locked and you must get the attention of the night watchman to enter if you don't have a room key to open the outside door. My husband and I arrived on separate flights and even though I pointed out to the evening person and then the night attendant (at 11:30 pm) that he would be arriving just after midnight, he was not able to get in and was left standing on the street for 20 minutes until he was able to wake me via cell phone. I had to go downstairs to let him in and had to walk by the office in the lobby where I could hear the load snoring of the night watchman. A bomb could have gone off and he wouldn't have responded! My husband was dressed in a business suit, carrying a briefcase and felt very exposed at that time of night as the hookers and others spotted him banging on the door of his \"hotel\". The front desk staff were helpful and the rooms were very clean but many little things like no drinking glasses in the room one night, a wasp's nest on the ceiling of the main room, a running toilet, the cover for the toilet flusher fell off in my hand once, no blanket on the bed, only a sheet and a heavier sheet for a cover, no soap dish in the shower so you needed to hold the soap in your hand, the closet was in the middle of the hallway, no mirror in the bedroom.....all added up for a negative experience for us. I've read the other reviews and if you needed a small kitchen to feed a child and an extra room to spread out a lot of gear, this would work but as a middle-aged couple looking for a secure and comfortable place to stay, we were disappointed. We stayed three days and then returned for another night at the end of our trip.

So, in the event of a fire \u201cwhich you should not use the elevator anyway\u201d A) the boxes catch fire and your blocked in or contribute to the blaze or B) someone bumps into them as they are hurrying out they collapse and they impede the exit until you can clear a path thus slowing your Egress.

You have 2 private terraces [one at either end of the suite] which are worth the extra money. One terrace looks out to the back and you can see St Peters which is illuminated at night. The terrace to the front is the larger terrace which has the sun canopy over. There is a noisy extractor fan but we quickly realised that you just need to turn off the air conditioning to switch off this extractor while sitting outside. The suite felt spacious and had everything we needed... except a security deposit box which was a bit of a pain. I believe the other suites have one but for some reason they didn't put one in the penthouse suite. Location is just amazing. A short walk takes you to the Trevi fountain. I would agree with the other reviewer, probably about 7 minutes. The Barberini metro station is almost just across the road from the hotel and is highly recommended for getting around Rome. 1E will get you a 75 minute journey. The vatican is only 4 stops away and so is the Colloseum [change lines at Termini]. Very clean, cheap and efficient - nothing like the London Underground! Anyway, getting back to the hotel. I would recommend it to anyone planning a break in Rome. Decoration is mimalistic and walls are painted a fresh white. Very clean. The main living area has a kitchen corner which has a fridge [with small freezer compartment within], small hob, kettle and a small selection of crockery and cutlery. There is a little supermarket about 5 minutes away so you can stock up on things for breakfast etc. Also in the living area is a sofa bed, dining table with 2 chairs, TV, small unit which has the Sky box in it and a closet. The bedroom has a king size bed and a table either side. The bedroom has a huge window which overlooks the terrace to the back. The bathroom has sink, toilet, bidet and shower. The shower is roomy although not a huge amount of head height. That said my husband is 6'3\" and still managed to fit in! The door to the apartment is very secure. Downstairs there is a separate door for access which you have a key for which saves coming through reception, there is also an intercom for the suites here. There is a small lift. There are plenty of restaurants and shops in the area. The air conditioning is very efficient and was brilliant considering how hot it is outside in August! The daily cleaning service was brilliant. It appeared that the bedding was changed every day. There is some artwork in the hotel that wasn't really to my taste and some nudity in some pictures. This hotel is gay friendly. The staff were very helpful in arranging airport transfers by car, which will cost 70E. All in all if I was to return to Rome I would definitely stay here again and I would highly recommend it.

We stayed in Suite # 2 which was on the 2nd floor. The rooms were nice and clean which was important to me. The refrigerator in the small kitchen was perfect as it enabled us to store drinks and breakfast items. The kitchen was also very well equipped with plates and cutlery and even pots and pans if you are inclined to cook. The Barberini is actually more like an apartment hotel (apartelle) than a hotel. So if you are expecting a hotel then this place is not for you...They do not have a concierge like the big hotels and the front desk staff although very nice and very friendly could not cater to your needs like a concierge does. The Barberini does not have a large sign in front so it might be difficult to find it when you first arrive. We actually arranged for the hotel shuttle to pick us up from the airport and it cost Euro 65 for a family of four. If money is not an issue for you, I would definitely suggest this option as it was more relaxing to arrive in Rome knowing that the driver was not out to get us. Location was also an added bonus....You could walk to the Trevi Fountain and to the Spanish steps. It will take you about 10 minutes to walk to either location. As a matter of fact, we managed to walk to the Trevi Fountain on the night we arrived and managed to catch it while it was still light since it was so close by (We arrived at about 8:00 PM). If you read Angels and Demons and want to follow the the walk of Bernini's Rome (as described in DK Guidebook for Rome), the hotel is a good base to start from....

The Residence Barberini is definitely ideal for families with kids...", "Date": "June 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Choice\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3343662", "Content": "Stayed at the Residence Barberini in early April for 5 nights. Ended up staying in two different suites (#8 and #12). #12 is the penthouse so when it opened up, grabbed it for a couple of nights. We were in Rome the days leading up to and after the Pope's funeral so the City was very busy. I was staying there with myself, two teenagers and one toddler. Here are my impressions: Cleanliness: Excellent. Rooms: Excellent. The penthouse is probably best for 2 people as the sofa bed in the living area is not very comfortable. We did OK with it and really liked the views the two patios offered from the suite. However suite #8 worked out well for our family of four. The rooms also included small kitchens and that was welcomed by our whole family. Staff: Excellent. David was very helpful in trying to locate a Kodak battery charger that I couldn't seem to find on my own. He went out of his way to make my kids feel comfortable and meet our needs. The remaining staff was also very good. They had good restaurant, market and shopping recommendations. Hotel Location: Very central but a bit hard to find. Seems the property isn't well known yet so shuttle and cab drivers had a hard time finding. It's right off Barbarini Square (big fountain in the middle of traffic) and has a market, pharmacy and other conveniences close by. Ammenities: The hotel's satellite TV actually worked and the free internet access they had available in a small office off the lobby made my teenagers very happy. It also helped me stay in touch with my office after my Blackberry died. Overall: Would stay here again in a heart beat, especially if I could get the penthouse. The views of the City it offered are excellent and worth the extra money.", "Date": "April 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel for travelers with more than 2 ppl\u201d", "Author": "amiprice", "ReviewID": "UR2483000", "Content": "We stayed at the Residence Barberini in August 2004 and found it to be an excellent hotel. There were 4 adults and we wanted to find a hotel where we could split a room - this was excellent for that. The room was about the size of a standard 1 bedroom apartment in the US and had a pull-out sofa so that all 4 adults could sleep comfortably. We also had privacy due to the layout of the room. Another bonus is having a kitchen - because drinks are very expensive in Rome, we found a grocery store and stocked up on water and soda for the room - big plus for the hot days in Rome. The location is great, right by a Metro line, within walking distance from the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, and many other sites in Rome. Of course, Rome is a walking city, because their subway system is really inadequate, but you can also pick up many buses at Piazza Barberini. I would stay again.", "Date": "August 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cStylish apartments in great location\u201d", "Author": "OnThePoint", "ReviewID": "UR2302319", "Content": "Residence Barbarini on the Via Quattro Fontani, just a few metres from Piazza Barbarini was a wonderful base for our family during a week in Rome in January 2004. The location is terrific. A couple of hundred metres from the Spanish Steps in one direction, the Trevi fountain in another and the Via Veneto in another and with the Palazzo Barbarini art gallery just next door, we were delighted. The reception is small but ultra trendy with extremely friendly and helpful staff. This is an old building, but the apartments have been very well renovated with lots of marble and some quite unique artworks. The views from our apartment were limited but charming - up the Via Quattro Fontani, a quaint street with lots of activity. There are lots of restaurants about, a pharmacy right opposite and an internet cafe about 50m away. The kitchen was a little dingy (no natural light) but we ate out most of the time. The other rooms were fine and the bathroom very pleasant. This is classic boutique accomodation, with the sort of quirks that make you pleased you didn't book into an international hotel. We felt very much part of Rome. The only drawback is lack of facilities like pool & gym.", "Date": "July 16, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cMixed experience - but good for families\u201d", "Author": "RT", "ReviewID": "UR1384735", "Content": "Stayed here twice (at either end of a 2 week holiday).
