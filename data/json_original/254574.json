All of us were extremely pleased with what we got, especially due to the little money we had to pay.

Had I known what I was to experience, I would have never booked my stay there and I would have warned anyone considering the misfortune - which I am about to do now - of ever even entertaining the thought of staying there. While I admit that London is one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most expensive cities, and you would be hard pressed to find anything less expensive than around eighty Euro per person/night at a hotel - I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d honestly rather spend a little extra (and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a very frugal person) than ever stay in a place like this again. If I were forced to look at the hotel from the perspective of the glass being half full, then I would say that the bed was comfortable, there was soap provided, the shower was clean and there was a functioning TV. These are the most positive attributes I can adorn the sorry excuse for a hotel, and the management is lucky that I say as much as this in a kind light. Having not read the former lodgers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reviews online prior to my stay, I had no idea what I was about to encounter upon my arrival. I was only going to be in London for one day and night , and I had an important meeting the next morning at East Finchley Tube station, and needed to find a hotel that was in the vicinity to where my meeting point was to take place. I found only so many hotels online that were in proximity to East Finchley Tube, and one of them was 'King Solomon'. It was the most economical hotel, and seemed to be the only thing available - and now I know why. Upon arrival at 11 AM, I approached the entrance of the hotel with a bit of trepidation, noticing the area which I was in, was not the nicest. I also paid close attention to the fact that it was a Jewish establishment- catering primarily to Jewish patrons, which included the menu in the restaurant. To be fair, I did not pay attention to the name of the hotel - which may or may not have been a give away - but I think they could have made mention of the fact that it is geared mainly to Jewish clientele, as to not make other guests feel out of place. When I entered the hotel, I was stunned to see a completely different looking lobby area than what I had seen on the website. It was in utter chaos; The entrance was small and cramped, there was one small loveseat- like pleather sofa, one chair and desk. To the right was a door, and to the left, also a door. The woman behind the counter greeted me, but was not overly friendly. I smiled and said I had a reservation to which she cut me off and said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to check in.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, hoping that their would be actual customer service. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alright,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I continued, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153when is check-in?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not until 2 o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122clock.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said matter-of-factly, and with a look I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appreciate either. She looked away from me, and continued doing whatever it was she was doing behind the desk. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Alright. I need to go do some things, may I leave my bags here?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pleasantly enough, and proceeded to take me through door number one on the right. There was a very dark, narrow hallway and some cupboards on the left hand side. She opened the cupboard and told me to put my things in a fairly cramped space where some other guests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 baggage was already being stored. I felt a little bit under pressure, as I needed to get some things out of my suitcase to take with me, and there were people waiting to get through the hallway - but not enough room to pass me, as the hallway was so cramped. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if it was someone who worked there, or just a guest, but a man who had come through the same door as us a moment later, began flirting with me in a very uncomfortable fashion, to which the receptionist quipped, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother the customers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He made another flirtatious comment toward me, which I ignored, whilst taking the things I needed, as he pushed up against me to get by. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind, but I did. I grabbed a few of my items, and closed the locker. She asked, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Okay?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a friendly enough tone, and I reluctantly said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yeah.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She walked behind me as we left the unattended and unlocked locker. Wait - isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that an oxymoron? I asked her if they would be locking the locker, to which she responded very apathetically, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yeah, yeah, I will.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She, again, looked away from me as she said it, continuing to work on whatever she was working on behind her desk almost unhappy that I was there. I asked her politely if I could use the bathroom, to which she said again in friendly enough tones, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She then began explaining where the bathroom was, and I lost her, but tried to find it anyway. I did get lost - albeit I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not the best with directions, but even so it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be that difficult to find a lobby hotel bathroom, especially that tiny of a hotel - and I had to go back again to ask her. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She asked surprised and a little annoyed that she had to explain once again. She tried, and upon seeing that I was losing her again in the direction process, had to force herself to get away from behind the desk, and probably had to bite her tongue not to say what she was thinking, and showed me herself. The bathroom, I discovered, was through two different hallways, and in another section of the hotel altogether. I can scarcely begin to describe the magnitude of disgust and fear that came over me when I saw where I was going to be staying, and where the restaurant was in all this madness. The whole downstairs area seemed as though it were under construction, but then I came to the conclusion that this was just its normal state. Dirty, dusty, colorless and drab. The door to the left of the reception was where the madness begins. Out of that door, you proceed into a long, curvy, narrow hallway. Through the last door, it leads you outside. You walk to your right to get to the restaurant, and you walk straight on to get to the other section of the hotel where you can find the bathroom. After a few twists and turns back to the reception desk from the bathroom, I managed another smile and so did she, and I asked if I could come back much later that evening, as I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how long my day would be. She said that was fine, just as long as it was any time after 2 PM. I thanked her for her help, and then reminded her to lock the locker - which I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think is an unreasonable request - to which she replied, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the tone of a teenager responding to a mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s request to make sure she cleans her room. My day in London ended in the evening, and I was back at the hotel at approximately 7:30 PM. By the time I came back, new staff was at the front desk, a young man in his twenties from Romania. The girl that had helped me earlier was also in her twenties, with long dark hair, she seemed to be Israeli, but I could be mistaken. The man that was on duty now, was cordial enough, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know who I was, and I had to explain that the girl beforehand had left my luggage in the locker. Without even checking identification or giving me a number to match the luggage beforehand, he accepted my statement as fact, and took me into the back and let me collect the luggage myself. He found me on the computer with my reservation, checked me in, and proceeded to escort me to my room. He said the room was on the way from where the luggage was. I had my luggage in hand, and could see that there were rooms on that floor. However, my room was not. He led me through a long and winding hallway, which had a total of four doors (including the one that led from the receptionist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desk to the first hallway), a long and winding staircase (also narrow), and finally up to the floor where my \u00e2\u20ac\u0153room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd awaited me. At first, he did not want to help carry my luggage - actually refusing to do so - and after he saw that I was having difficulty keeping up and because he had made a mistake and led us up the wrong staircase at first - he finally picked the bags up and aggressively said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Here\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and led the way. When we did arrive inside the room, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m fairly certain my jaw actually touched my toe, for I was in shock with the size of the room. I felt very much lied to, and I was seriously starting to believe I had accidentally booked with the wrong hotel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh my gosh,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I thought to myself, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153did I remember the wrong website? Did I book with a different hotel, than the pictures I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d seen?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd No! This was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel. And more than anything, I was pissed off. Not because the room was so small. Not because the hallways were so narrow - certainly not because I could hear the neighbours all night and also the next morning, and also when they peed and flushed the toilet - no\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I was pissed off because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been lied to. This was not the room they showed on the internet. I was extremely tired from my trip and from my day, and the last thing I needed was to get into an argument with an eastern European downstairs, but this is what it had come to. It was not my fault. I trotted downstairs, trying to pay attention to where I was so that I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lose my way going back up. I needed to get something to eat anyway, so I thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d kill two birds with one stone. I go talk to the front desk and then also get a bite to eat in the restaurant. Not knowing of course, what was on the menu. I walked up to the desk and in a serious, but not altogether rude manner I asked to speak with the manager, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the problem?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He asked, as if he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The room I have, is not what I requested. A mouse couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t live in there. And I feel very deceived because of the pictures on the internet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He checked the reservation politely enough and said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yeah, you booked a single room - and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a single room.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the picture on the internet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take pictures of all the rooms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, so you only take pictures of the nice rooms, and then say that that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what they all look like? That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little deceptive, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you think?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He shrugged his shoulders. It really wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t his fault. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to speak to the manager, now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, the thing is,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he began, and I already didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe him. He looked down, and then back up at me, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s giving birth in these days, so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know when she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be in.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a phone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He shook his head \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, when will she be in again?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maybe tomorrow at around 9:30.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I thought ahead, I would have just enough time to ask for my money back, but then I would have to skedaddled for my meeting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Right, okay.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I thanked him and then asked him if the restaurant was still open. He politely told me where to turn and that yes, they were still open. The restaurant was very nice, I must say. Very tasteful, with nice lighting, nice music, a bar even\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6what I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize was that the menu was not up to par, to at least, my own standards. I looked over the menu, and the friendly waitress which gave me time to sit down and agreed to package whatever I ordered up so I could take it back up to my room, came and checked on me and helped me with the few questions I had. I tried to find the least expensive thing on the menu, but that sounded desirable, and I went with the ravioli. I asked her what kind of meat it came with, to which her friendly smile drooped to a horrified perplexity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t serve meet at this restaurant. Only fish. This is a kosher restaurant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And then gave me a look as though I should know this. I was more than disappointed with the meal, which was over 10 pounds, not a small amount of money, and ate a total of about five bites because it was inedible. I was very upset about that as well. That same night, when I went back to my room, I tried calling down to reception, but the phone did not go through. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a line. I had to go all the way back downstairs to ask the receptionist if he would please come upstairs to help me with the TV as it did not work. When he came up, he had to leave the front door open, as there was not enough room for the both of us to fit in the tiny room. The bathroom was an interesting adventure as well. To take a shower, you had to manoeuvre yourself very strategically in getting in. It was literally the tiniest bathroom I have ever encountered in my life. The next morning, when I approached the front desk once again with my bags in tow, ready to check out and try their free breakfast with stay, there was once again a new face behind the counter. Another man who tried dodging the fact that the manager was in fact in. I told him I had a complaint, and he wanted to know what it was regarding. I told him as well that I felt I had been deceived and I wanted to speak to the manager. He pointed her out to me, and when I finally managed to have a discussion with her, she was not rude but not friendly. She coolly told me that she would check my reservation while I had breakfast and she would see what she could do about a refund. I was pleased with the effort - or at least with the reported effort. I went into the restaurant once again, to find a buffet of food which, in my opinion, was inedible. All kosher once again, there were things like tuna fish with corn, burnt coffee which I took one sip of, and some other strange concoctions I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even stomach to look at early in the morning, let alone try to eat. I skipped breakfast and went back to the reception desk. To the receptionist of the night be fore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit, she was in fact pregnant. She informed me that she could not provide me with a refund because I had booked through a booking site, and not directly through their hotel. She offered - and albeit, qualified it first by saying that it may not be something that I would want to do, but - if I would like, she could offer me a free stay the next time I am in London, in one of their best rooms. I accepted, as this seemed to be the best she could do, but I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy with the alternative to a refund. She asked for my e-mail address.

We then had a look at our bathroom and as I opened the shower cubicle the glass door came away in my hand. Also if we had of decided to stay in this room there was one curtain hanging down the middle of a double window(did they expect us to choose which side of the window we wanted it to cover.)

After a wonderful week together in Brighton, we'd decided to stop in London for a night and go to see a show in the West End. We found this hotel online and it seemed to offer a decent price and good, basic facilities i .e. a bed, en-suite, tea/coffee, TV etc. However, my advice to to you is as follows. Unless it's scathing in its criticism, do not believe anything that you read about this establishment. For the owners to even call this a \"hotel\" would seem, to me, to be an offence under the trade descriptions act. It is nothing more than a filthy, dirty, unhygenic, worn-out, broken-down dump. To be frank, all the adjectives and words of criticism that the English language places at my disposal would not do this place justice. If you haven't heard enough yet, do read on. Firstly, when we arrived we were asked to pay upfront and provide details of our credit cards. This was, with hindsight, a bad sign. We were then given the keycard for our room and directions to find it. We navigated our way up a narrow, creaky staircase behind the reception desk and through a warren of similarly narrow and dingy corridors until we found our room. Ah, the room! The size of the room wasn't too small, but it wasn't particularly large. As it was a hot day and my wife and I had spent about an hour shedding bodyweight and sweat on the underground, we decided to have showers. The shower basin and walls were dirty with mould. Then, despite running the shower for around 20 minutes, I couldn't get any hot water. Then , suddenly, hot water came, but the dial on the shower didn't seem to actually control or alter the temperature of the water. I had a shower and so did my wife. In addition, there was no plug in the washbasin in the bathroom and the plughole was swathed in human hair, which certainly wasn't ours. Then we found the plug for the basin ... sat on top of the little striplight above the mirror. The plug was also covered in hair. Showered and increasingly sceptical, we decided to examine the rest of the room more closely. Firstly, the sheets on the bed, the eiderdown, and the pillows were all dirty. By dirty, I mean that the eiderdown and the sheets had suspicious-looking yellow stains on them - skidmarks? semen? - in a number of places. The pillows also had dirt on them. The carpet hadn't been vacuumed for sometime, it seemed. The tea/coffee facilities included a kettle, two dirty coffee cups, dirty teaspoons and some sachets of tea, coffee, sugar, and milk. All were covered in a layer of dust, as was the tray they sat in. The TV, mounted on a bracket high on the wall, was connected to the mains via an extension cable stretched halfway up the wall - to reach the TV's plug - and hanging free behind the \"desk\" in the room. Our wardrobe had a safe. Before we went out, I placed my camera in the safe. A good move, methinks. When we went downstairs, we mentioned the dust, the bathroom, the dirty sheets, pillows, eiderdown at reception and asked them to ensure that the room was cleaned in time for our return later that evening. To cut to the chase, that didn't quite happen. The same dirty sheets, pillows, eiderdown etc had simply been turned around, turned-over. No dusting had taken place either. We called reception and asked them to come and do it. A man came up to our room and duly changed the bedclothes. After he left, he checked them and, what do you know, the new bedclothes were also dirty and covered in dubious stains. We called reception asked them to change the bedclothes again. Lo and behold, one set of dirty bed linen was exchanged for another set of dirty bed linen. We gave up at this point and weht to bed without using the pillows, blanket or ediderdown. We were kept awake half the night by a bunch of men - who seemed to be friends of the owners - talking, laughing, shouting on the \"patio\" below our window into the early hours. Breakfast! What really, really annoyed me about breakfast was, firstly, the poor range or poorly prepared food and drinks on offer. No croissants, no orange juice, just a strange selection of things that, unless you're Jewish, you'd never dream of eating for breakfast. Secondly, and I still get into something of a rage about this when I think about it, the fact that we had to toast our own bread for breakfast. I don't mind doing that at home but, you know, one tends to assume that, at a hotel, when you've paid about \u00c2\u00a365 for a room and breakfast, the breakfast would be prepared by the staff. But, no. We had to toast our own bread, make our own coffee etc. So, to conclude, do not ever, ever, ever even contemplate staying at this \"hotel\". It is a dump. There's no other way of saying it. As other reviewers have commented, you'd be better off sleeping on a park bench or getting yourself arrested so that you could spend the night in a police cell. When we left, it felt like escaping.

Room very smelled, there was splitter bed with dirty covers, in the bathroom there was dirty basin and the water didn't flushed out and the walls was full of moulds. After this experience he decided to change the room. The new room was the same but the bigger window. I came back on the very next day because I didn't find another accommodation for that night, so I had to stay. My room was near to the reception and it was alike my colleague's room. It was also furnished with splitted bed with dirty covers, impossible smelled, dirty basin, water didn't flushed out & walls full of moulds. This room has 3 bonuses: TV didn't work, dirty glasses for tea/coffee maker, and the curtain was very dirty and full of hotes. On the very next morning we was happy that our stay here is about to finish, we packed up our stuffs and went for breakfast. We had egg and tuna. Disgusted from this hotel we finally went home.

If you've had this type of nightmares: enhance this dreary feeling of impending doom by a thousand, and you'll get the general impression this hotel left. If you haven't, let me give you some examples of how we liked the hotel. I say hotel, because as you pay to sleep there, it technically is a hotel. If the place were for free, the term 'City dump' or hellhole would be more aptly suited. The corridors, rooms, doorknobs, light switches, toilet, carpets, walls, ... were dirty. I'm talking about years of accumulated dead skin cells, greasy paws, sex fingers, ... not just some superficial grime. Breakfast... now... breakfast... started off well. We were given coffee cups with the Segafredo logo on them. So far so good. The coffee however, was served as granules, and you had to get your own luke warm water. One of the reviews for this hotel, dating back from last year, mentioned a tuna/sweetcorn salad and some other tripe: i think i ate the same actual tuna salad. There was no toast. Ye shalt not make Toast on the High Holy Day that is Saturday (the hotel has Tora scrolls at each doorpost... we know because we opened one, and then smoked the scroll). Unfortunately, on Sunday the breakfast was more of the same. No toast. Not because Sunday is a high holy day for those of the Jewish faith, but probably because the owner/manager is a lazy bugger who can't be arsed to keep up even infinitesimally small standards. Our room did have a radiator. It did not work. We did have a fan though. Our room had a skidmark on the wall. It was well hidden by the cobwebs, but after we cleaned those away, the skidmark was There. It was Always There. Like the Mona Lisa, it followed you through the room. Upon trying to escape the penetrative stare the skidmark, i moved the room's chair out of the way, to discover that it was lodged up against the wall to prevent the skirting boards from falling over. Our only light bulb gave of an eery fluorescent glow and was basically just two electricity wires sticking out of the ceiling, with a bulb attached to it. This was getting a bit too much, so we decided to brake the house rules, and have a siggy through the window. Our room had a view, we were actually looking at a concrete wall that was erected just a few feet from the window. Thank god the window\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were too dirty to see it. The top 15cm of the window could open, but this took considerable force, as birdpoo had sealed off the seams. The bathroom had - contrary to our bedroom - a window that could open. It obviously could, as it was open. It cannot be closed though. A generous spraying of polyurethane and some cheap foamy insulating material was used to avoid serious drafts in the bathroom. When sitting on the toilet, i could wash my hair in the shower and brush my teeth at the same time. Well, actually i couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, since the tap is was not working and the plug was stuck in the bathroom sink. I did try out the toilets in the bar/breakfast area, that serves as a meeting place for local Jewish people. I got out very fast: no toilet paper and the king of all turds trying to crawl out of the bowl. Conclusions? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d love to go back.

I struggled up to my floor with suitcase. Once I went into the room I realised why the price was so cheap. It was very small and just not up to scratch. The radiator didn't work and it was cold. The tv had no remote and it was difficult to change channels even manually. The sink had no plug. There was no toilet roll holder so you had to first find where they put the roll and then remember each time to get it first. There was a telephone but no instructions how to dial reception or how to dial out. They provided a kettle for tea and coffee but the plug was under the table and with a short lead I was boiling the kettle on the floor under the table.

No sign of a remote control. - As we arrived (at 2.30pm - two and a half hours after check-in time), the room was still being 'cleaned'. - Despite the room being cleaned, it still smelled and had sticky and dirty carpets and stained curtains. The walls above the bed was also filthy. - Actually, the whole hotel smelled badly. - Floor boards were creaky (and so were the floor boards above our room). - There was a light switch next to the bed (but surprise surprise - it didn't actually work) - At night, the room was as quiet as war, with people shouting in the corridor outside in the early hours of the morning.
