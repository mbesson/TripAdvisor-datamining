The motel is a dump. Noisy, carpet in the room is old and smells. Carpet outside on the deck is worn and torn in places. The room there wasn't even kleenex's. The continental breakfast consisted of cold ceral and coffee was cold. I booked through Hotelsone website and when I got there to check in they didn't even have my reservation. It took over an hour and 3 phone calls by me to get my reservation straightened out.

The location was perfect, a very short, no traffic drive to SDC. There is a McDonalds and a Pizza Hut right next door. The motel itself is dated, not new and flashy but seriously for $39.00 a night what on earth could you find to complain about? Rooms were clean, bathroom was clean and everything worked fine. TV reception was good with lots of channel choices. Is this a 5 star resort... of course not! Is it clean and comfortable, yes it is. Pillows were a bit on the flat side, take your own. Never tried the breakfast ...went to McDonalds and it was fine. I don't know what kind of breakfast people expect when the room cost is less than $50 in a tourist trap like Branson.....I don't know how they can even meet expenses at this price. If you want a clean room for a good price then stay here!! We NEVER had a traffic problem until we got into Branson on 76, the location of this Inn makes it a lot easier to get around the mobs!!", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eudora", "Title": "\u201cThink twice\u201d", "Author": "BradleyEudora", "ReviewID": "UR118277095", "Content": "We stayed two nights.

This is the fifth year that we have stayed there. It is a great bargain for the price. The room is very bare bones - two beds, a 19 inch tv, a small table and a dresser. They do not give out any toiletries except a very small bar of soap. However, the room is very clean. The pool is very clean. It sits a few miles from Silver Dollar City. It sits right next to a dollar general store as well as a small grocery store. It is about two miles from a super Walmart. It does take about 20 minutes to drive into Branson but it is a beautiful view. It sits behind a pizza hut and a mcdonalds so you can walk to get some food. You have access to a coin operated washer and dryer but it costs 2 dollars per load for both the washer and dryer. There is a laundry almost across the street if you want to save money. The people who run the Inn are very helpful and friendly. They do provide a breakfast in the morning - biscuits and gravy, toaster waffles, toast and cereal as well as juice and coffee. Can be a cost saver it you have a large family. Overall I have been very pleased with the place. Paid 50 dollars a night but expedia usually has a deal in July where you can either get one night free with two paid nights or a 50 dollar gas card with three paid nights. You can't beat the value.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cDISGUSTING\u201d", "Author": "johns0687", "ReviewID": "UR68695376", "Content": "I wasn't expecting much for $53/night but this hotel was the grossest place I had ever stayed. The day my sister and I stayed there it was almost 100 degrees and our air conditioner hadn't been turned on prior to our arrival. It took until we checked out for the room to actually get cold. The door had 3 locks on it if that tells you anything. The desk man didn't ask for ID for me or my sister when we checked in. For all he knew, he could have been giving a room to teenagers. He refereed to us as \"the last of his children to get in for the night ...\" creepy!! The room had a terrible smell and the comforter was disgusting.

We had a very unpleasant experience in Eureka Springs but arriving @ Lakeview was much better!!! Shawn was more than helpful with information about town, breakfast, anything we needed. The refrigerator wasn't working and after a few hours almost the time for him to leave he was able to locate another one and replace ours. The breakfast was ok, nothing special. A mix for the gravy and waffles that look like they are bought in bulk. Would have preferred a muffin or english muffin, bagel or something besides bread. The rooms were cleaned and restocked daily. The only problem I had was someone had cleaned the room while we were gone and it smelled of cigarettes!! Yuck!! Didn't like the location of the pool. The people above us was always up @ the butt crack of dawn and you could every time they would walk!!! But really all in all it wasn't a bad stay and we would stay there again. It's convient to food, laundry, a store (family dollar) has internet, good location, away from 76 where you can catch you breath!! The only bad thing I would say is the pillows are pancake thin!!!

At first glance the room appeared clean. It wasn't until later that we discovered the cock roaches in the bathroom. We also found their crushed remains on the side of the box springs. The beds were very uncomfortable. I can only relate it to sleeping on boards laid across a concrete slab. The first morning I woke up and even my elbows ached. The shower was also a problem. It would not keep a consistent temperature. We were treated to very hot to very cold over and over again. A great way to start the day. The continental breakfast is a joke and isn't worth advertising. On top of all this the location is terrible unless all you plan to do is Silver Dollar City. The strip where most of the shows are located is a long drive. This is especially true with Branson traffic. Please do yourself a favor and avoid the Lakeview Inn. Their motto is it's the best kept secret in Branson. It should stay that way.", "Date": "July 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cYuck!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3533856", "Content": "This Hotel was in one word disgusting.
