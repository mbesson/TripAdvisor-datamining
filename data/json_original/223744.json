Initially she evidenced an attitude that seemed to indicate she thought I just didn't know how to turn on a TV. Once she ascertained that the TV was indeed broken, her attitude changed and she became friendly and helpful. The third room was clean and fine for our needs with a working TV. Sadly this hotel has paper thin walls. I was awakened around 1:00 am and again around 3:00 am by people coming and going in the halls. Breakfast was adequate. No fresh fruit and no yogurt--toast, cereal & waffles. OK but nothing to write home about.

Was reasonably close to the Memphis area. Seemed to be in an undesirable neighborhood. I was worried about leaving my vehicle in the parking lot because there were plenty of people loitering in the surrounding property at midnight when I went to the next door gas station for a drink. Room wasn't that bad. Had a hard time working the AC, but it got the job done. Internet was good. Room was semi clean, stains on carpets - but what hotel doesnt have that. Toilet was broken, and had to be adjusted after every flush to prevent it from running loudly all night - something they obviously encounter every time they clean the room, but never bother to fix. I was on the top floor to avoid any family noise/disturbance. This didn't seem to work. There were older kids going through the hallways at all hours. At one point around 10pm one of them actually knocked at my door only to say \"whoops wrong room\" and walk away when I answered. Breakfast was lousy. Standard continental breakfast with a waffle maker. Waffles were gross, tasted sour, like the batter had gone bad. Breakfast was also supposed to start at 6am, but when I went down to the area it was still being set up by the front desk worker and it wasn't ready til about 6:20. I also found out that my checkout receipt showed a double charge for the room. I had to speak with the manager to get the issue corrected and verified that my account would not be overcharged. Because of the hassles, I probably wouldn't stay here again. When I am business traveling I just want to relax and not worry about little things. It was a pain having to fix the toilet after every flush and play with the thermostat every 30 minutes to keep the room comfortable. I usually like to be out the door by 7am, so waiting for breakfast to be set up was also inconvenient. I also shouldn't have to worry about my credit card getting double charged or my vehicle being stolen/broken in to.

The attractions are located mostly in downtown Memphis. If you do not mind the the drive from the East Memphis ( where the hotel is) to downtown, then its okay. But, if you do, I would recommend booking a hotel either in downtown Memphis (if you don't mind paying, but everything is only a walk away) or stay in West Memphis which is only 15 min drive from downtown. The room was average and dirty. Our very first night, we found a huge yellow stain on the bedspread and well, we never used the blanket it ended up in the corner for the whole time that we were there. The shower curtain had stains on them, and showerhead was not appealing either. The floor was dirty, the room size was decent but if you had lots of luggage, you didn't have enough room to move around. Our door would not shut properly, so everytime you opened the door or closed it , you would have to double checked making sure it was completely closed and locked. The only thing that I found nice about this hotel was the sink. It was actually nice had you had lots of counter space. Everything in the hotel needs work or at least some updating.

The staff is friendly and helpful. The breakfast is good for a continental breakfast complete with juice, coffee, muffins, different types of breads and cereals, bagels, hard boiled eggs and yogurt. The exercise room is nice with a treadmill, stairmaster, exercise bike and TV. If you are allergic to pets or cigarette smoke, be sure to check your room before you rent as they allow both. Avoid the third floor especially if you are allergic to smoke. There is a nice Cracker Barrel across the street and several restaurants within blocks of the hotel. I've never tried the outdoor pool. The Internet connection can be a pain as it is sometimes slow and goes down. For the most part, this is a good hotel to stay at in the area. It is within 20 minutes of the downtown, seems a safer area, has a good staff, is mostly clean (they need to vacuum under the beds more), and good for the money. I've tried several other hotels in this area. The Drury in is really nice across the street but costs $89+ a night and above what I want to pay even if you get a hot breakfast and drinks and snacks in the evening. The Ramada Inn has issues. I tried to rent a room there once because I had a coupon and figured since it was a chain hotel it would be nice but after looking at four rooms (three of which smelled terrible and one where the lock was broken because it looked like someone forced the door with a crowbar) I decided to stay at the Baymont instead.", "Date": "June 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "FRESNO, CA", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Hotel!

There were taco bell wrappers and drinks in the room, the ironing board was out, and the bed wasn't made properly. There was also visible mold growing in the bathroom. We talked to the girl at the desk and she immediately put us in a suite which was a lot bigger. She said we'd get compensated as well. This room was clean. The floors had stains on them and the toilet made noise every 15 min like water was flushing down it. It served it's purpose though since we were only there to sleep for two nights. When we checked out, we got one night free and was charged for the regular rate, not the rate for the suite. I thought that made up for everything.
