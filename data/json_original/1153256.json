This is basically a businessman's hotel with underground parking. They have small suites with a fully equipped kitchen, clothes washer, dish washer and flat screen TV (no English stations). The wifi is very fast and the breakfast buffet is above average. There is absolutely NO english language information in the hotel (when are the Europeans ever going to smarten up and realize tourists patronize places where they feel even a little at ease).

Arrived in Madrid at 10pm and had to wait 50 mins for the shuttle bus. Rang the hotel only to be told it was nearly there - but it wasn't. Arrived at hotel eventually and queued to check in. The surly receptionist asked to see my daughters passport and told us that as she was 13 (it was her bithday the day before) we would have to pay for her to be in our room. When we booked we were not told this so refused to pay. After much messing around she reluctantly agreed to waiver the charge but was obviously not happy. By this time there was a large queue behind us so it was all a bit embarissing to say the least. Eventually got to the 'suite' and it was horrid. Basic with paper thin walls, it just looked awful. The kitchen didnt have a single plate, cup, or glass - whats the point in having a kitchen ! Bedroom was small with a teeny window and the most vile bed I have slept on in a while. Limp and lumply pillow which didnt smell very clean and the bedding consisted of a sheet and a horrid manky looking blanket with a thin and unattractive cover on top. My daughters bed was shoved up a corner in the lounge and was equally horrrid. Would have complained but by this time we only had about 5 hours to get some sleep so decided to get on with it. However next doors TV could be heard through the walls and ny husband and I were constanly itching - maybe the blankets?? Ended up hardly sleeping. I am not a constant complainer, if you look at my other reviews you will see that but I would say only go to this hotel if there are no other options, we hated it and it spoilt the end of our holiday. Only paid 60 euro but dont think it was even worth that.

I arrived at MAD at 11pm but checked in at 1am. Painful waiting with other frustrating travelers for hotel shuttle. Forget taxi drivers. They will not take you in their car, unless you are going to far away places. Later we found out why we had to wait that long for the bus. Apparently, they have only one shuttle bus and the hotel is good 15 minutes away driving time from the airport. I have nothing against the shuttle driver. He was probably the nicest person that I have dealt at this hotel. As I have mentioned it above, I arrived at the hotel at 1am. My first impression of this hotel was; \u201cconverted offices into a hotel\u201d. Check in was very fast and I asked for 3am wake up call. Yeap, I was planning on being at this hotel until 4am since I had flight to catch at 6am. The check in clerk put me down on the shuttle bus list for 4am departure. I went to my room, which was on the third floor. My room looked like typical European two bedroom apartment. Nothing special but better than average. My bedroom was very cold and even setting the thermostat to high temperature it remained cold until my check out. Room with the TV and sofa was very hot so I stayed there for some time before I went to my bedroom. I did not like the fact that there was no TV set in the bedroom. However, on the other side, TV in the sofa room had only about eight channels and all of them were in Spanish. I was very tired (16 hours on the road), but because of the cold room I could not sleep. I spent rest of the time in this hotel flipping thorough Spanish channels and staying warm in the sofa room. When I got my wake up call, I went to the bathroom to take the shower. To my disappointment, there was no hot water, not even warm water. Immediately I went downstairs, explained my situation and asked for room replacement so I could take shower. My request was denied! I was told that I should open the water and wait few minutes for it to warm up. After running water for 30 minutes, I gave up, took my stuff and went downstairs to catch my shuttle bus. There was no traffic at that hour so I got to my terminal in 10 minutes. I will not stay in this hotel again for sure.
