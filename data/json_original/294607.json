After all that flying time I do not want to deal with a taxi. We had a written comformation from the hotel and we were provided with a detailed map as to where the driver would be. We were also instructed to look for a person holding up an i pad. We were not happy that non of this happened. We followed the instructions and found no driver, so we went back and forth looking for him. Finally a young women not professionaly dressed told us to follow her she would take us to the hotel car. I honestly was apprehensive but we did and the car was waiting. The driver was not very gracious but the car was perfect. Once we arrived at the Intercontinental we were well recieved and the staff all greeted us by name. That is something that does not go unnoticed. Check-in went smoothly.We were taken to our room on the 17th floor which is the business level. The room was very warm, and they sent for someone to adjust the a.c he was not successful so we opened the window The bathtub was not very clean there was a film in the tub . We were offered the option of selecting another room for the following day. The concierge was notified earlier that it was my husband's birthday and we found a birthday card on the desk in our room. The concierge service was not that impressive it was erratic, when asked to reconfirm our flight schedule he did not want to do it,my husband basically talked him into it. The business center staff was so-so. When asked to extrend our stay they claimed the hotel was full .We had to go to guest services and we were able to extend our stay. That first evening we opted to eat in their restaurant on the top floor the food was good, no complaints about their service, and the view was exceptional. They surprised us with a birthday cake and they even sang Happy Birthday and other guests joined in. That makes for great memories. I thank them so much for this. Not only is it a good choice for dinner but for cocktails as well. The breakfast buffet is quite good, but the business level breakfast does not offer as many choices. Location is very convenient and the historical sites are just a reasonable taxi ride away the pedestrian shopping district is close by. The area offers many restaurants and shops and the subway stations is close by as well. Best of all the bed was very comfortable and we slept very well. Lots of bottled water was provided. The business lounge has a 6:00pm happy hour, which we chose not to miss. I enjoyed their local white wine.

They had at least 3-5 staff members in the club at all times which was mostly empty. I suggest buying club level if you stay at this hotel not only for the free food and booze but the great service. Only thing I think they can improve on is to communicate that they will open the gym if you request. I read from another poster that it was closed and was upset. Then read from a different one that all you have to do is ask. I asked at 5:30am and they promptly opened it for me. Overall great stay and if I return will book here again.

A perfectly placed hotel with easy access to just about everywhere in the city. Staff offer exceptional service without being over the top and they all seem genuinley pleased to be working here. The bars offer many choices and for stunning views alone just aim for the roof (Floor N), OK so you pay a premium for drinks up there but what do you expect? As for eating, I have a perfectly adequate breakfast in the Club Lounge and a few drinks in the evening all inclusive on my tariff. From the hotel you need walk less than 50mtrs to find more than enough choices of restaurants, so if the hotel seems a little pricey there are some excelent options. As for getting about, the metro is easy, cheap and on the doorstep, bus tours 100mtrs up the road in the main square and masses of shops (branded) and small bazzars again only a few meters away. I was apprehensive with reading all the stories of taxi drivers and hassle from shop vendors and can say that I had absolutely no problems,this appeared a very safe and comfortable city to walk around at all times and exeptionaly litter free. So, the Intercontinental, well it is a comfortable top rate hotel, I consider Intercontinental to be a statement for quality in standards and service and in my opinion you get what you pay for and in my case as the title says I can't find anything bad to say about my stay either in this hotel or the city.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria", "Title": "\u201clittle to much used\u201d", "Author": "markus20er", "ReviewID": "UR124868729", "Content": "the hotel is rated as 5 star hotel but in the rooms , especially in bath room it is to much used , i mean it is clean but it look like very much used , the tab is not working well ,all the fittings for the shower are loose,it look that nobody cares about , the room is modern and nice but the bed is not so good it makes to much noise when you move in it ,one thing is really special , it is the room service menue , all prices in there are in euro and not in turkish lira , so you must be care full what you choose!! also the mini bar prices are in euro! but when you check out you have to pay in turkish lira !! and the exchange rate is terrible !!! i know they dont care ! because the main customers are coming from the arabic area so they have a lot of money to spend , and the hotel will help them to do it , also in the reception the stuff is not friendly , you always feel that as person you are not welcome only your money is welcome", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leuven, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cclose to Taksim square but to far from the old city\u201d", "Author": "Ineke_Belgium", "ReviewID": "UR124792531", "Content": "When you enter the hotel you have to pass through a metal detector and then you enter in a large lobby which has a luxurious colonial/ottoman feeling to it. The rooms are a descent size, have a minibar and coffee making facilities. In the bathroom I even had a scale! From your room you also have a nice view at the city but the traffic noise you can still hear a bit (even though I was at the 7th floor). If you really want to enjoy the view you have to go to the top floor where there is a bar and restaurant. The breakfast buffet has a good variety of hot and cold dishes with also a variety of Turkish items. If you want you can sit and relax in comfortable sofas in the bar nex to the lobby and have a very expensive drink (8 euro for a soft drink). The meeting room are well equipped although you constantly hear the airco which is rather annoying and the chairs are not very comfortbale to sit on all day. Five star service: staff welcomes you when you enter; helpfull to carry your bags; when you return in the evening the curtains will be closed, bathrobe and slippers being placed on your bed and a card with the next day temperature will be available; when you order a coffee in the bar you will receive some cookies with it; restaurant personnel is very friendly and helpfull. Reasons for not being a five star service: front desk personnel could be more friendly (like the restaurant personnel); drinks in the bar (and also the minbar in the room) starts at 8 euros for only a soft drink which is too expensive; the food at the buffet is a bit to much Turkish influence; to much background airco noise in the meeting room.

I stayed for five nights for a conference. I prefer hotels like a Marriot Courtyard as the rooms are just as nice, but without the high price frills that come with a place like the Intercon. On arrival, even though I only had one bag, the doormen practically mugged me for my it. I prefer to carry my own bags, but lost this battle, meaning I was forced to tip the baggage handler who brought the bag to my room. I had to wait for this guy to arrive with my suitcase, and all in all I considered it a waste of my time. You receive a few minutes of free Wi-Fi a day, or can buy a contract for a better deal, though still pricey. Internet is censored. Each night, room service would come down to my room and turn down the bed, and put out a bathrobe and slippers (I usually don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use either). At night I like to either relax or get some work done, and found the evening interruptions to be distracting and even annoying. I asked the Front Desk to stop with this service, but it continued. The gym is good, but the spa is expensive. If you go to the top floor of the hotel there is a really nice lounge with a good view of the city, but a local beer costs $12.00 US. One great tip: In the hotel lobby there is a small bakery on the opposite side of the entrance. At about 6 PM, all the remaining sweets, breads, etc, are reduced by 50% in pricing. These deserts were awesome if you have a sweet tooth, and you could not beat the price. The food and service was good. Our conference provided breakfast and lunch, and both were suburb. I never ordered al a carte. You cannot, by the way, drink the tap water in the hotel, but they provide free bottled water. Most nights I went out for dinner. Stay away from really close restaurants as they will really rip you off with high prices. I found the wait staff at one nearby restaurant had padded the bill. The nearby shopping district has many restaurants catering to locals and side street outdoor restaurants for tourists, staffed by aggressive staff members trying to drag you into their restaurant; seek out places for locals and not the places geared towards separating tourists from their money. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m somewhat old fashioned and like to send post cards to friends. Get your stamps in the hotel. I ended up paying a 200% mark up on stamps at a local ship, and when I realized I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been had, I went back for a refund and received a long and emotional dissertation about how there were special prices for foreigners. I was only out about $10.00 US, but after living overseas for so many years, I still felt sheepish for letting the merchant/bandit slip this by me. While we were waiting in line to get tea from a cart vendor, I noticed the prices locals were paying. When I went to pay for my tea, the merchant tried to demand double. Istanbul is a very European city (traffic is a nightmare!) and it has lots of old world charm; just be wary of the tourist traps and what seemed to be a penchant for fleecing visitors.

It is located within walking distance to Taksim Square, which is the heart of the modern part of the city, and there are many public transportation options which take you to Sultanhamet, where are the historical attractions are located. However, if you're short on time and want to hit the historic highlights, consider staying in Sultanhamet. The hotel itself is nice, but more attention is paid to its lobby and rooftop bar than the rooms, which were only mediocre. My only complaint is about the single, twin-sized bed. What luxury line does that any more? My room had a wonderful view of the river. And the complimentary bottled water, electric kettle, tea and coffee were a nice touch to the room. I agree with other reviewers about the internet policy -- this day and age, people expect wifi in their rooms, and for it to be included in the price of the room. Luckily, there's a business center that seemed to be open 24/7, and computer terminals were available free of charge. Also, the drycleaning charges were outrageously expensive. Though they did a thorough job, and returned my suit jacket quickly, the $19USD charge was a little tough to swallow. The lobby stores are outrageously expensive. You'll do better in the markets. There was one store tucked away in the back that never seemed to be open, even though its lights were on during business hours. I managed to finally flag someone down to find the store owner so that I could inquire about the prices. They were asking 75 euros for a pair of earrings with bits of semi-precious stones; I found the same quality and styles available in the Grand Baazar for a fraction of the price. On a positive note, the belt-busting breakfast buffet choices were incredibly generous, and you cannot possibly think of anything else to want! The sheer quantity of options were overwhelming. As was the case throughout the hotel, if you wanted any service, though, you had to flag someone down.

It would require taxi journeys to the Blue Mosque and the Topkapi Palace. Entering the hotel one is stunned by the apparent grandeur with a swirling staircase. Spacious lobby, marble and plush furniture extend into a \"Palm Court\" and a highly polished English Bar (didn't see anyone use it). Reception was always busy, usually three or four members of staff eager to respond to need. Checking in at 10 a.m. I was surprised and pleased to know the room was available immediately. A pleasant, reasonably spacious room with a good bathroom. As someone who suffers from vertigo I was a little stunned when I saw the floor to ceiling, wall wide window at the end of the room (8th floor). One must say it was a splendid view, but I had to hold on to something whenever I went close. We dined out. The hotel has at least two restaurants, but they are pricey. In fact such prices annoy me. We found a very modest restaurant within two hundred metres used by locals and tourist and had a reasonably priced and satisfying meal. At breakfast in the hotel the English are not forgotten - scrambled eggs and bacon are available - but Turkish fare dominated. I certainly enjoyed a mixture though the egg was cold. Service was good and the restaurant comfortable.

Cabs cost around 18-25 tl depending on the traffic and it can be quite frustrating if u get stuck in the mad traffic. So I recommend taking the excellent trams to the city. The funicular station at taksim is only abt 5mins walk and will take you down to kabatas which is the nearest tram station. From kabatas the tram goes straight into sultanahmet.

The doormen who hail the taxis provide you with a slip of paper on which the license of the taxi is written on one side and the other a list of estimated fares for many of the more common attractions. The room was comfortable, the bed provided a great sleep, and I had a great view of the Bosphorus that was easy on the eyes. I never tired of it. The concierge was extremely helpful in arranging a couple of day trips: one to Efes and another to Princess Islands. As a woman traveling alone I was comforted by the fact the tour companies were ones which the hotel frequently did business. As a woman traveling alone I found this hotel extremely comfortable! On my birthday a floral arrangement appeared in my room. Also at dinner the staff of the Grille brought me a birthday cheesecake with sparklers and sang \"happy birthday\" to me. What a great memory.

If you're looking for some old style Ottoman experience, perhaps you should stay in Sultanahmet. There are plenty of small family hotels in that historic area , charming and clean, close to the main tourist attractions, but you'll never get the standards that Ceylan offers although you are probably paying the same amount or more.

This was the biggest upside and downside of this Bosphorus hotel. Easy access to bars and restaurants, great views, but an exhausting hike for tram users and mentioning the Intercontinental makes you an easy mark for Istanbul's less than trustworthy taxi drivers. Taksim Park is not recommended for tourists after dark and judging from the touting and being approached by random \"friends\" offering to take one to bars, Taksim Sq after dark made this hotel location uncomfortable for me. We booked a Club room and had an unobstructed view of the Bosphorus, with even a very distant view of the Aya Sofya and Blue Mosque. At AU$560 per night, it was one of the most expensive Club rooms I have stayed in, considering the room was pretty standard in size. The Club on the 16th floor had lobby-like seating with a separate meeting room and dining rooms (inaccessible outside of breakfast and \"happy hour\" times). Breakfast was sparse with adequate continental selection and 3 small bain-maries of warm food. Only Turkish wines were on offer and even those were low end on the scale of the widely varied standard of local wines available. The spa and gym facilities were great and the local hamami (bath house) was a beautifully sanitised version of the grungy experiences we had elsewhere The service was of a high standard, although the farcical \"security\" measures seemed quite pointless. I walked through the scanner with backpacks and set it off everyday, with no further requests to screen being made. Overall, a beautiful view, nicely appointed, great service.

Its location is quite excellent: Basically, Istanbul can be divided in three parts: the Asian part, which isn't of much interest to the traveller, the ex-Byzantium part, which is were all the touristical attractions are to be found, and the Northern district of Galata, where modern five-star accomodation, shopping streets, trendy restaurats etc. crowd. The Ceylan is within Galata which means that you need to use the dependable public transport (0.75 EUR, ca. 25 mins) to go to the historical centre, but which also means that you have a direct airport bus to your hotel, a breathtaking Bosphorus view (there are, of course, no highrises in the historical centre!) and the fancy restaurants for your evening meal nearby. As regards me, I couldn't think of a better location. The hotel itself is what you would expect from a steel-glass construction high-rise property; everything is as it should be (nice lobby with live music, efficient elevators, excellent security). What makes the Ceylan outstanding is the PC status recognition: In case you have the Royal Ambassador status, this is the place to be. We had free access to the excellent club lounge (which I would recommend anyone to book, not only for the food, but also for the relaxing check-in/out atmosphere) and got upgraded to a spectacular Executive Suite. There aren't many obvious downsides to this excellent hotel. I did not appreciate the way the window glass was coated which resulted in unnecessary reflexions (which is sad, given the breath-taking view across the Bosphorus and the almost daily fireworks), and while sound-proofing within the hotel was excellent (we never heard neighbours), a festival of the Communist party of Turkey who invited their Cuban comrades for a concert (no kidding!) was able to penetrate the sound protection.

Being an Intercontinental, of course it was clean, nice, etc etc. We made use of the concierge who helped make forward reservations for a couple of day trip outside the city. This was above and beyond the call of duty and was greatly appreciated. The hotel's swimmig pool was nice, although we only used it once. We thought we might come back every day in the early afternoon to swim and refresh, but there was so much to see in the few days we had we just kept pushing onward. If it had been open later than 8pm, we might have used it more. Yes, we saw a Hollywood movie star in the lobby. I won't say which, but a pretty big one. He was just sitting and talking to the director about the next days filming. I mention this only because I had read that the Intercontinental is where celebrities stay when in Istanbul and I dismissed it as useless and irrevelent information, but now I can confirm that the useless and irrelevent information is true. The location is good, at Tacsim Square, and a fun, but long walk down the busy pedestrian shopping street and across the river to the main historic sights, but you can't do it more than a couple of times before you just start taking taxis. Fortunately taxis are easy because everyone knew the hotel so we didn't need to give directions. Turkey is an widely varied culture. It was fun for us to sit in the lobby and watch the local couples arrive dressed to the nines for dinner or various receptions. Very stylish. Great breakfast buffet. Lots of variety, nicely laid out. Nice service. Good way to start each day. My one complaint about the Intercontinental world-wide, not just in Istanbul, is that they nickel and dime you to death. Once inside, everything is overpriced. The minibar prices are crazy 5X the prices around the corner . The hotel suggested tours are double or triple normal. The restaurants are at least twice for similar outside. So we use it as incentive to get out and about, but boy if you come back to the hotel at night and are too tired to go out to eat it is going to cost you. $10 a day for internet--come on... I just don't get it because the ill-will they generate on the mini-bar and internet must surely out-do the extra $20 a day they get from you. If you are on business.

You get fantastic views from practically all rooms on the higher floors (we were on the 11th), either looking out to the Bosphorus bridge or the historic Sultanahmet peninsula. the hotel is very well run, with incredibly efficient staff who deliver fast and polite service. The lobby is spacious and elegant and, despite the fact that the hotel was at capacity when we visited, it never felt overly busy. If you are looking for a quiet and comfortable place to retreat to from the sensory explosion that is Istanbul, then the Intercontinental is certainly a good choice. The location is ideal for a visit to the city that wants to go beyond the typical tourist traps, and you are still close enough to the main sites: Dolmabahce palace is a 5 minute stroll down the road, the famous Istiklal pedestrian street begins almost at the back of the hotel, leading you down to the Galata tower (20 minutes steady walk), and then across to the Sultanahment peninsula on the other side of the Golden Horn. The posh Nisantasi neighborhood is again only 10-15 minutes walk away, with brilliant restaurants, the expected line-up of boutiques and cool galleries. I would also recommend catching a cab over to the Asian side and heading for Caddebostan, an upmarket residential area that is wonderful to walk around and has a bustling shopping streer (Bagdat street). The hotel itself ticks all the boxes, but does not deliver a truly outstanding experience. The rooms are comfortable, clean and roomy, but do not really stand out. I would have hoped for a better bathroom, as this felt rather cramped and a tad bit outdated. A separate roomy shower would have been nice. However, the views from the floor-to-ceiling windows make up for what the room lacks in wow factor. The hotel has one of the better spas/hammams in the city, although I personally felt the treatments were overprices with hour-long massages starting at about 150 Euros. The hotel has a rooftop Ottoman restaurant (Safran) where we spent New Year's Eve. The views from here are even more spectacular, but the food fell well short of expectations.

The price quoted was $480.00 for two nights which I thought was very reasonable for a 5 star establishment at New Year. We arrived at noon and were informed that our room was ready. We asked to change it to a smoking room for which there was a 45 minute wait. We were still early so no problem there, the bellboy checked our bags and we had a coffee and beer in the beautiful foyer. An hour later we were given the keys to our room. The room was very nicely appointed with beautiful furnishings and great view of the city. However the bags in the room weren't ours and there were someone elses belongings all over the room - put quite simply, they gave us someone elses room keys. Fortunately for them the person was not in the room. They might have been surprised had we walked in on them in the shower. Returned to reception to explain this to the front desk and they could not understand why they had given us the keys to someone elses room - the reason they gave was that they had someone else of the same name in the hotel and that's where the mistake was made - fair enough - I'm just glad it wasn't my room, I could have been doing anything!. On arrival to our room our bags were already there and the room was just as gorgeous and well appointed and nice fresh smell - no hint of it being a smoking room as the ventilation and windows are excellent. After a sleep in the very comfortable beds and linens we went to City Lights Bar for a drink and the best views of the Bosphorus and the city - amazing. Enjoyed a bottle of wine for $80.00 Booked the restaurant next door for a really nice Turkish meal - note - exact same bottle of wine $190.00 on wine list. This was common for all drinks. If a drink cost $15 in the room service menu it would be $30 in the bar and $40 in the restaurant for exact same. Room service breakfast the next day was sumptuous although a 2 oz glass of juice and enough hot water for only 2 small cups of coffee is not good value for money on a $50.00 breakfast. I could understand a little less something else but juice and water, c'mon guys this is miserly for the buck especially if you are thirsty and getting charged $20 for a bottle of water from the minibar. The front doorman was very good, he greets you with a smile and looks after you. The room price was great, the other prices could and should be justified a bit more.

Although they have all the accomodations and the facade of a five star hotel, you get better attitude at a Motel. We had a group of over 35 people stay at the hotel, and at the end of the stay, we all agreed on 4 things: 1. Not one person smiled ONCE during our stay. Extremely unfriendly staff (with the exception of the bar tender. nice guy). 2. Transferring their problems to the customer. A few of our guests had issues with their credit card upon check-in. Instead of trying to help out the customers, they basically told them to figure it out on their own, while charging them 7 Euros / minute for the call. At the end the issue was with the way they are booking the transaction. This was explained to them, and yet they still repeated this issue with others in our team. 3. Nickle and Dime you to death Everything is an add-on. Internet access, 25 EUR / Day. Coffee $10, etc... 4. Ridiculous Prices I wish i had taken a menu for laughs. just some items I recall: - Beer: ~15 EUR - Coffee: ~5 EUR (12 YTL) - Mix Drink: ~30 YTL ($25 USD) At the end, the thing that bothered all of us the most, was the real unfriendly environment. This started from the Reception, Waiters, etc... On the positive side, the rooms are clean and the comforters very nice. Also, the hotel has beautifl view of the bosphores (not sure if this is the case for all rooms). As for location, this is debatable I guess. The hotel is located close to Taksim square. Which seems to be a transportaion hub. So getting to the more touristy areas (Sultan Ahmed)is not a problem at all. But it does require taking the Tram.
