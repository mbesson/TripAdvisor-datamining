I had a minor problem with the power in my room which was fixed instantly. All the staff I met were friendly and obliging. The buffet breakfast was very good and had a wide range of options (most of them Western). There are lots of coffee shops around so if you don't get a room including breakfast, it's not a problem. I'd stay here again if I could get a good deal. I left my bags here for the day after check out and this was not a problem.

I got a 3-night stay package from Agoda in this hotel at US165/night. For Singapore, it was cheap. There were other hotels that were cheaper at that time but the location of this one was a big factor since it was near an MRT station. I booked and paid for this hotel two months before my trip. How to get there: MRT or taxi. Since I brought huge boxes with me for my business trip, I had to pay for an airport transfer that uses large car due to my baggages. I paid S$60, a fixed rate fee which gave me a car that could accommodate my luggages and boxes from the airport to the hotel\u2019s doorstep (good thing my boss is paying for the airport transfer). I got this car through the ground transportation desk (left side corner after you exit immigration). Another option is to take the airport shuttle at S$9 but I could not use this because of the luggages I had. Taxi from the meter stand is another option which would have cost me around S$23 based on my research at the internet. I arrived at the hotel around 12:30. Although they processed my checking-in papers, they informed me that the room is not yet ready for the next twenty minutes. I decided to leave my stuff with them while I explore the neighborhood. I came back three hours later and my room was already ready. The room size was better than expected. Certainly better than most hotels in Hong Kong. The bathroom though was on the small side and if you are a large (sideways) person, taking shower might get a little claustrophobic since you need to take your shower in a little corner enclosed with a glass door. If you do not close the glass door, expect the water to flood the whole bathroom. But its bearable. The bathroom was clean and hot water was available so I\u2019m okay with it. Bring your own toiletries though coz the shampoo they had was a little harsh on hair. No toothbrush set so don\u2019t forget yours. The bed, I read from other reviews, was a little hard but it was actually okay for me. The pillows (which were of hotel quality) more than made up for the firm mattress. I was suffering back aches when I arrived there but I had good three night sleep when I was there. The TV, although flat screen, was a very small TV. I think it was the size of a computer monitor. TV channels were limited but if you don\u2019t plan on watching TV in your stay there, I guess its okay. Internet, wired and wi-fi was free! Awesome. And it was fast. I had my Ipad and had no problem using the internet. If you need to print something, you can use the computer at the lobby. It was also complimentary to hotel guests although I found the speed of internet there a little bit slower compared to the internet reception I got from the room. One of the best part of the room is that its not carpeted . Instead, the floor was made up of laminated floor type material(I don\u2019t know what its called). This is okay with me compared to hotels that have old carpet. This one screamed \u201cNEW and CLEAN\u201d for me. Bring bedroom sleepers if you don\u2019t want to walk around barefoot although you can actually do that also. The Bugis MRT station is two streets away from the back of the hotel. You have to walk thru Bugis Street building in order to cross the street (Queen\u2019s road) that will bring you to Bugis Junction building which houses the MRT station. You can\u2019t miss Bugis Street since it\u2019s a red building and had a \u201cbest street shopping in Singapore\u201d sign in its awning complete with tacky lights. FROM THE AIRPORT OR OTHER MRT STATION: When you alight from the MRT, you take Exit C. As you exit from that, you will see the Bugis Street building in front of you. You will have to go thru the building and you will exit in another side street full of people selling a lot of stuff. Just walk straight. You will see another street across you with the name Burlington. Do not cross the street as this would mean you are already in Bencoolen. Just turn left and you will see Ibis hotel entrance after 7-11. There are two 7-11 in that corner building. The bigger 7-11 is the one nearest Ibis. Another option, if you want to avoid Bugis Street (as it is very busy as soon as it opens around 11am) is to take the side street on the left side which actually brings you to Bencoolen Link street. Instead of going thru the Bugis Street building, turn left and use the side street. You will actually see a \u201cbencoolen\u201d street sign signage. Use that road and you will walk straight to the back of the hotel. You won\u2019t miss the hotel (left side) because it has a circular driveway plus there\u2019s a signage. HOW TO GET TO AIRPORT FROM IBIS. You can take the MRT. Just avoid the rush hour as much as possible. It depends on you or your budget. I took the taxi because I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t want to stress out on airport transportation. The taxi fare was S$14.22 from Ibis to airport (Terminal 2). The best part of the location of the hotel is that there are a lot of stores within the neighborhood. Street hawkers are in the corner of the hotel (turn right when you exit hotel from the Bencoolen side). You can go to Bugis Street or Bugis Junction if you want to eat or shop from low to mid-high prices. Since Singapore is not a cheap destination, any savings in food cost will come a long way.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore, India", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location and a very good hotel\u201d", "Author": "nishidk", "ReviewID": "UR128039216", "Content": "It is the first time that I have stayed in an Ibis hotel and I was very satisfied with the overall experience.

My first impression was of apprehension as I was not the one who made our booking. Lobby was small but the staff were very courteous and helpful. When they noticed that I was just standing around waiting for my companions to check in they asked if I had any questions and how they can help me and they already pointed out the places of interest around the hotel. The rooms are small, beds are small but surprisingly quite comfortable. They seem to have thoughtfully designed the room to create more space like hanging the flat screen tv and instead of a full closet you get a small corner closet with a bar and some shelves. You do get a desk and also a corner seating area which got quite some use from us. Breakfast selection is not too good, it would be better to just grab breakfast at the hawker center behind the hotel which serves a better selection of local food at a very low price. On the 2nd day I just walked to the Bugis Junction about 10 minutes and got a kaya toast set from Ya Kun Kaya Toast which I enjoyed tremendously. Given another option I would not choose this hotel to stay in.

Previously I have stayed elsewhere in Singapore. Both in areas more up such as Orchard Road as well as more down at heel, such as in Little India. If you\u2019re looking for a budget hotel in the Republic of Singapore, I doubt you\u2019ll find a better place than this IBIS. The Pros of the hotel in my humble opinion are: * Efficient use of space in the guest room * Clean and functional bathroom * Free wifi in rooms * Nice size cupboard * LCD TV (screening Channel News Asia and Al Al Jazeera but sadly not Fox News or BBC) * Coin op laundry $4 per wash and $4 per drying (change available at reception) * Mini b/fast is served from 0400-0600 * Buffet b/fast is served from 0600-1000 cost SGD 18 + tax if booked and paid for at the hotel but only SGD 13 + tax if booked with the room * Internet kiosk in lobby By taxi the hotel is SGD 6 in the middle of the day from the hustle and bustle of Little India. Should you decide to travel by taxi at other times, then beware of: midnight surcharges\u2019, \u2018peak hour surcharges\u2019, \u2018city area surcharges\u2019 \u2018Changi Airport surcharges\u2019 and \u2018Marina Bay Sands Casino\u2019 surcharge. An MRT (Mass Rapid Transit, the public subway) stop is Bras Basah 7 min walk, best made from the REAR entrance to the hotel. There is a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf caf\u00e9 at that MRT (on street level). And I noticed that most of its food is kosher, for those interested. Being pernickety, I confirmed that only THIS Coffee Bean in Singapore sells Kosher food and beverages. On the subject of beverages (not food), this Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf is certified Halal. Several doors up from the Coffee Bean is a 130 year old synagogue in what seems like \u201cBritish colonial style\u201d architecture. Simple yet elegant. There is another MRT at Bugis, a 7 minute walk from the hotel in another direction. Cons of the hotel Only one: when I returned to Australia and before I received my credit card statement, my bank called me about a SGD 100 charge by IBIS. I did not understand why I was charged. The room was prepaid and so called \u201cholds\u201d by hotels on cards (at least in my experience) are limited to DEBIT cards. Mine was a Visa CREDIT card. Anyway, I complained to the hotel which replied they place such holds on CREDIT cards and \u201cit should be released in 2-3 weeks but if not, please contact us\u201d. That's correct. I must chase IBIS up to if their charge is not reversed in 2-3 weeks! This is an outrage. Say I stayed at 7 IBIS hotels in Singapore/Malaysia/Thailand in a period of one month, as I plan. Am I to expect up to $700 to be \u201con hold\u201d until IBIS (or its agents) see fit to release the funds? In short, I liked the hotel. It was good value, regrettably marred by the funds \u201con hold\u201d matter. Best money saving tip: in one direction at least, forget shlepping to the MRT or scouting for a surcharge laden cab when you want to visit the beautiful Marina Bay Sands Casino. Instead, catch the bus #857 from just outside the hotel. Ask to alight opposite the Ritz Carlton. It's a 12 min walk to the Casino. And speaking as someone who has not been to Vegas, I doubt Vegas has anything remotely opulent as this magnificent complex. And do not forget a hat (it's a WARM 12 min walk under a blazing sun) and bring your passport to gain entry into the casino. As a foreigner there is no entry charge for the casino. If you're a Singaporean or a permanent resident there you'll have to pony up SGD 100 to enter. In summary: I\u2019d give the hotel a solid 8 out of 10.

I did not take breakfast at the hotel, but there is a local food court at the back of the hotel where you can savour the famous Singaporean local street food. Yummy and cheap.

It has a great location, pretty much in the middle of Singapore. It is close to the temple; its right next to it. During the evening, there are many small shops on the square right next to it (and to the temple) its almost like a night market. Bugis Junction is very close by for all the shopping and dining. Hotel is close to Sim Lim Square which sells electronic stuff. It has a 7-11 right outside of the hotel; if you walk out of the Bencoolen door, its right on your Right-side. The small shopping plaza to the south of it also has many small shops and eateries. It also has money exchange there. There are KTV and clubs just few blocks away, you can walk there in 10 minutes. The taxi drop-off area is on the back side, not on Bencoolen street, so sometimes taxi drivers dont know, but you have to tell them. Sometimes you have to wait for the taxi for a while. I never took subway so I cannot comment there. But there is a bus stop right outside on Bencoolen, but I dont know what it is. I paid USD185 per night including breakfast and 1 other meal, but I never had lunch or dinner there. Internet is free. Room is definitely on the smaller side so I dont recommend it for family of 3 or more. I wanted a large bed but they just put 2 twin bed together. That wasnt a big deal. TV was also kinda small. There was no complimentry tooth brush nor paste. Bathroom is on the small side. Again, this hotel is for either budget business travel (which was me) or single/double travellers who will go out and do things, instead of staying in hotel all the time.

What's outstanding about this particular Ibis is the staff, always ready to help quickly. When I fell going into the nearby 7-11, someone went over to the hotel to tell them. The hotel sent over 2 security guards and someone from the front desk with a wheelchair and they took me back to my room and got me comfortable. Later when I went down to the dining room to have dinner, the man from the desk was there and he got me some additional ice and helped me back to my room. This was definitely service above and beyond their usual duties and was very much appreciated. The meal I had in the restaurant was very good, although, for me, the portions were rather small.

I personally find their rooms to be bland, but they do provide good value in some expensive cities (i.e Singapore and Kuwait). Check-in was friendly and efficient, though there was a delay in attending to me due to it being a busy period, but no matter. I found all staff to be above average in their customer service skills, so kudos should go to them. Room were small (but normal for Singapore), immaculately clean and functional. The bed was firm, but I wouldn't term it as hard. Two people staying here might find things tight, but being on my own, there was no shortage of room. The bathroom was also smaller than normal, but not uncomfortably so. The in-room safe was probably the smallest I have seen and it was difficult to even place a limited amount of items in it (1 DSLR + 1 Wide Angle Lens + 1 Netbook = Full). This does cause problems because if too much is inside it will prevent the door from opening. Staff obliged in opening the safe for me, but commented that this is a common problem, so it appears that I'm not the only one who found the safe too small. The area near the hotel is one of my favourite in Singapore. If you head onto the main Bencoolen Street and turn right, Little India is within a ten minute walk with plenty of great eating options, and even closer is Sim Lim Square, an excellent place for those who love to spend their money on electronic items such as computers and cameras. The prices here are very competitive when compared to alternatives elsewhere. My stay was excellent value for money as I obtained an extremely good rate due to a 50% off sale with Singapore Airlines Stopover Holidays - the price was only 75 SGD - an absolute bargain! Even without the discount, if one flies Singapore Airlines, I'd recommend using their Stopover deal as it still a good price and includes transfers from and to the airport. If I had to pay the rack rate, I would probably stay elsewhere since there are better options around for that price.

As the rooms have hardwood floors, cleanliness is easily achieved by the housekeeping staff. The bathroom features a walk-in shower, wall mounted hair dryer, and adequate counter space for two. The location of the hotel is wonderful. Bencoolen Street is my favorite location as a base camp in Singapore. It's about two blocks to the Bugis MRT station.On the way there, you can stroll through the exciting stalls of Bugis Village, as well as the indoor shopping available at Bugis Junction. Walk one block west to Bras Basah to dine at the Kopitiam, an air condtioned hawker center featuring economical yet tasty food. Walk two short blocks to the north to Selegie Road for the Starbuck's. There is a bus stop directly in front of the hotel, which can get you almost anywhere. I recommend that you get a SMRT card and load it with $20 so as to take advantage of Singapore's comprehensive public transportation system. It looks as though the new MRT line under construction will have a stop at Bugis station. For those who desire a taxi, there is a cabstand at the hotel, which generally has a cab or two standing by. This made our early morning departure for the airport trouble free. I thought I was going to have to carry the laundry up to the laundromat on Selegie Road, as I have done in the past. I was happy to discover that the hotel has a laundry room with 4 coin operated washers and dryers. Each requires $4 to operate. Bring some individual packets of your favorite detergent, as laundry soap is not available in the laundry room, but 2 irons and ironing boards are. The dryer is good enough that only one cycle is required to dry your laundry. The breakfast at the Hotel Ibis is located in the first floor restaurant. It features the best overall selection of the three hotels I have stayed at in Singapore. Even after seven days, I was not becoming fatigued at the choices, which were excellently prepared, and constantly replenished. The restaurant also offers discounts to guests for lunch and dinner. My Singaporean wife enjoyed the local dishes available, and I enjoyed the cheeseburger with seasoned meat accompanied with the local Tiger beer. Previously, we have stayed at the Bayview Hotel, also on Bencoolen Street. Current MRT construction forced us to find a different hotel. The only thing that the Hotel Ibis does not have is a rooftop pool. All other facets of this hotel are superior to the Bayview. After this trip, we have decided to make the Hotel Ibis our new headquarters for subsequent Singapore visits. Not only did this hotel save us money, it also saved our trip!", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cA Very Nice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "rynelbrt", "ReviewID": "UR124602809", "Content": "I went to Singapore Last October 2011.

I've stayed at many Ibis locations in several countries and I can say that this location is as good as or better than any other Ibis. We chose this hotel based on location, price, and good reviews.

If you haven't stayed at an Ibis before, you should know that Ibis rooms are usually small by western standards, but they do not lack for features and amenities. We were provided with all of the toiletries, refrigerator, satellite TV, and excellent wi-fi. I was able to stream video from home using the hotel's wi-fi which was included in our rate. One thing that was really nice was that our flight landed at 7 AM. The hotel allowed us to check into our rooms at 8:30 AM when we arrived at the hotel and did not charge extra for this service. When we checked out we had a late check out... the hotel was very accommodating regarding these times. The location is excellent. The huge Albert Center food hawker area is withing walking distance, only one block. The big market at Bugis Junction is only two blocks away. The bus depot to go to Malaysia is only four blocks from the hotel. All are within walking distance. There are many restaurants and shops, and also a 7-11 on the ground floor of the Ibis. You can get everything you might need at the 7-11. We had short taxi rides to many areas of Singapore. The hotel has a taxi stand and taxis were always coming and going, we never had to wait more than 3 minutes for a taxi. Taxi rates are very reasonable in Singapore (compared to the US, UK, or Europe). There is little traffic and you can get around quickly. The taxi ride to the airport takes about 25 minutes and was about 25 SGD. Easy access to Clark Quay and the Geylang District.

On reflection, it just a case of you get what you pay. Don't expect 5 star service from a 3&half star hotel. Upon going into the room it's a whole difference impression. Although small (only abt 28sqm it's very well laid out and presented. Does not feel claustrophobic at all. Very functional and surprisingly extremely comfortable. The hotel is well located and with good accesses to local flavored food and shopping. The Bugis Shopping mall and Underground transit (MRT) station is only about 10-15 minutes walk away.

Check-in was very efficient with some very polite and cheerful staff members. I had actually made a mistake when entering my credit card details whilst booking online, and when I informed the receptionist of this mistake I was told that it wouldn't matter as the card system is used just a reservation and payment wouldn't be taken until I checked out anyway. Upon receiving your keycard, you activate the elevator to get up to your room by swiping it against a detector on the elevator wall and press the button corresponding to which floor number you need. The elevators are fairly fast and plentiful. Although I did not use the bar or restaurant (they were closed for some reason), both looked very nice and contained a lot of seating areas adjacent to the lobby. Ibis on Bencoolen, however, does not have great rooms. Apparently, all rooms in the hotel are of the same design and standard with no choice to upgrade or pay extra for any increased comfort or amenities. Firstly, there is no carpet on the floor of your room. For some people, this may not be a problem, but this is a 3* hotel for which I paid over \u00a3100 for a room for just one night, so cold, wooden panelled floors are not acceptable, especially not in Singapore, where plenty of other hotels of the same class, not only offer carpet in their rooms, but also offer other services such as room service, which Ibis on Bencoolen does not. Aside from the lack of carpet, Ibis on Bencoolen also has issues with its Internet service. The service is free, and it is WIFI, but it is very awkward to connect to this Internet and requires not only a code to be found on paperwork in the room itself, but also requests you to change your homepage and some other settings on your system before it can connect. I find this unacceptable and totally unnecessary. The WIFI speed was adequate, but nothing special. I have stayed in Ibis hotels in Seoul and Jakarta, and both had faster WIFI service than this hotel. It must be said also that my laptop appeared slow and suspiciously out of kilter to what I had been used to, even once disconnecting from the Internet upon checking out the following morning. That said, my experience was not all bad. I found the room to have very good artificial light which was good for reading and staying up to watch the television. Additionally, there was a fairly good selection of programming available from around the world. The picture quality was clear and consistent. What I liked about it, was a detailed panphlet informing me of what type of programs were on each channel. There were tea-making facilities in the room too, including a kettle, 2 mugs, and some Nescafe-branded coffee. An in-room safe is also provided, as well as coat hangers, and some extra blankets. In the bathroom, there were complimentary soaps and bodywash available. However, to end on a bad note, my room had a rather annoying infestation of ants. I realise Singapore is in the tropics and that ants are attracted to food, but this is a hotel room and I had only just arrived. Yet my bin in the room was filled with at least a dozen ants, despite the bin being empty. I also had ants crawl over my desk whilst I was online, which was rather annoying. Ibis are a great hotel brand. For their budget prices, you could effectively travel all over Asia and stay at their hotels. Properties in Bangkok, Phuket, Koh Samui, Shanghai, Seoul, Jakarta, Surabaya, Yogyakarta are among the best value in their regions. Of course, it is not a luxury brand, and usually you get what you pay for (that being, if you pay a value price for a room, you get less than if you pay a high price for the room). Yet this is where management let themselves down with Ibis on Bencoolen. This is Singapore, it can never be cheap, but regardless of this economic fact, Ibis must strive to offer good value for money, as they do with sister hotels worldwide. So for \u00a3100 per night (at the time of my stay in October), management need to offer more than hotels that charge less, and this simply doesn't happen at Ibis on Bencoolen. So just make sure you know what you paying for when booking here. Unless special cheaper rates apply, then it may be worth your time and effort looking at another hotel in the same price range, even another Accor Group hotel such as the Grand Mercure Roxy Hotel, which has standard rates almost identical to Ibis on Bencoolen - and it has carpet in the rooms, and it offers 24hr room service!

The hotel is located just a few minutes walk from Bugis Junction, several shopping malls and centers, Little India, the Arab Quarter, and within 15 minutes walk of the National Museum, Raffles Hotel, and Fort Canning Park. The Bugis MRT Station is about a 7 minute walk from the hotel and is one of the few MRT stations with a ticket office (10AM-9PM) where you can purchase a Singapore Pass or Multi-Day Transit Pass. I reserved a standard room and made a request for a room on a higher floor. My request was granted without problem by the friendly and helpful front office person. The room was a standard Ibis room; small, utilitarian, but clean and tidy and included a safe for valuables. The bed was comfortable and not too firm as is often the case at hotels in many Asian cities. I don\u2019t recall if there was Internet access in the room, either via a hard wire connection or WiFi, however, three Internet connected terminals were available in the lobby for guests to use at no charge. The room had a nice flat screen TV with a nice selection of viewing options, many in English. There were no amenities in the bathroom except a small bar of soap. Soap for the shower was dispensed from a container mounted on the wall. I did not use any of the dining or bar options at the hotel as there were so many options outside of the hotel and very close by. Overall, given the high price of lodging in Singapore, the Ibis on Bencoolen is a good option at a reasonable price if you don\u2019t plan to spend much time in the hotel. The air conditioning worked well and was not noisy. Although the room, overall, was clean I noticed a few things that needed some attention. The sheets on the bed had a few stains that appeared to possibly be from cigarette burns or possibly grease or burn marks from the laundering process (see photo). Had the housekeeper noticed this it would have been nice to use another set of sheets. In the bathroom I noticed mildew stains on the grout around several areas of the shower stall (see photo). This problem could be easily corrected with some cleaning solution. Other than these minor issues, I recommend the Ibis on Bencoolen as a good, moderately priced, lodging option when visiting Singapore. GETTING THERE From Changi Airport, unless someone will be picking you up or you have pre-arranged transportation, your options are a taxi (S$17-30 depending on the time of day, distance traveled, and traffic conditions), shuttle bus (S$9) which will take you directly to your hotel but may make several stops first based upon the number of passengers on the shuttle van, or by MRT (subway) for S$2. The MRT option requires one change of trains (same platform) and about a 7-10 minute walk to the hotel. This is only an option if you don\u2019t have too much luggage. I utilized the shuttle bus which was reasonably fast (45 minutes \u2013 I was the third person dropped off), cheap, and efficient. On my return to the airport, however, my only option was a taxi given the early hour of my departure. The shuttle usually does not run during the late evening / early morning hours and the MRT does not start running until about 5:30AM. Taxis charge an \u201coff-hour\u201d surcharge. The total fare to the airport at 4:30AM was S$28 (inclusive of the surcharge). To reserve the shuttle, you must call approximately two hours before you need to be transported.

The location is hard to beat - very close to an unimaginably diverse range of shops and food outlets. Like the whole of Singapore the area is very clean and very safe. You can have a perfectly acceptable dinner for $2.50 (Singapore dollars) at the unfashionable but tasty food courts or pay ten times that (or more) at the trendy restaurants with waitress service. Besides the public transport that others have mentioned, the taxi services in Singapore are very low cost but can be slow at peak times due to congestion. It's not problem to get a taxi from the hotel foyer (British English for lobby) day or night. The rooms are pretty basic and neither especially cramped or large. They all have air conditioning that you can't really control (there is a thermostat but it doesn't actually do anything so the only control is fan speed). That makes the rooms a little cooler than I would like but a welcome relief from the heat outdoors. There is space to hang your clothes and some shelves, but no cupboards as such, so you get the impression that most guests are here for just one or two nights. The rooms are well lit and there is a good desk for laptop work - broadband wireless is free for guests. Everything is very functional and there is no real elegance to this place, so there are big mirrors but no pictures, a medium-size TV but no movies, wipe clean wood effect surfaces, but no trees were sacrificed to make any of the furniture. There are sockets galore and these use the UK-style three-pin square plugs and some appear to cater for multiple plugs but get an adaptor that suits UK sockets if you're not sure. There are USB power outlets on the walls too - which is a sign of the times I guess. The floor is well, you guessed it, functional: bare wood-effect plastic. The rooms have a kettle and a couple of Nescafe sachets and tea bags. You can get milk at the 7-11 if you don't like the powder creamer (and who exactly does like that stuff?) Honestly as this is French chain, you'd think they'd know better. The bathrooms have showers but no baths and, like everything else, are spotless and functional and well lit. Bring your own shampoo if you don't want to use the dispenser on the wall - no freebies here. If I were to change one thing about the rooms I'd be including a small fridge in each one as there is no way to cool anything or keep cool items fresh. If there are any ice machines in this hotel then I've managed to miss them all. You can get ice at the 7-11 next door but it's very expensive ($1 for a cupful $15 for a bag full). I'm not sure if all the rooms have the door-to-the-next-room feature that mine has. Acoustically terrible: next door had a rotton cough that kept us both awake during the night so do ask about that if you're bothered - the air conditioning system does make some useful masking noise though. Also note that you need to use your room key (or a credit card) to keep the power going in the room, so when you enter there are no lights, the room may be quite warm and there is a musty sort of smell. No problem after a few minutes but do expect this and don't worry about it... unless of course you're counting on that power to recharge your laptop, phone, ipod etc. The hotel breakfast, like everything else, is functional and business like. Not especially good but not too bad either, if relatively expensive. The staff are very friendly and attentive. Like every other service provider in Singapore (including taxi drivers) they seem not to expect any kind of tip but will happily unload your bags from the taxi of direct you to the nearest xyz.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location for Stopover\u201d", "Author": "JYem143", "ReviewID": "UR121290551", "Content": "We stayed in Singapore as a Stopover option (like most) and it was a great choice!

We needed a place to crash for 3 nights in Singapore en route from Japan to Kathmandu, and this fit the bill nicely. The location was handy for its super-convenient access to a hawker centre, where we ate pretty well for $2-3 USD/meal. We mostly ran errands, buying silk from nearby Arab street and finding a good tailor in the upper floor of the hawker centre. Lots of shopping malls and low-end shopping centers nearby, and it's a short walk to Bugis MRT. This is not the modern/glitzy side of Singapore, so if you're after tall buildings and modernity, probably best to pick a different neighborhood. For us, the location worked out well. Singapore hotels, at least for our weekend, were uniformly expensive, which led us to Priceline. We ended up paying $110 USD, which was only a slight discount, and feels expensive in retrospect, but other hotels were charging much more. We wouldn't go out of our way to return, but our stay was perfectly pleasant and fine: no problem with Internet speed that I can recall, and we could print a few pages in the lobby free of charge. Room was a fine size: our high floor room had a huge bed and the flatscreen TV was plenty big (though we didn't watch it). The in-room tea was nice, just basic black and green I believe. Bathroom fine, nothing noteworthy. Everything was clean and tidy, and we were quite content, as we weren't expecting anything fancy from the Ibis. Basically, if you're not expecting luxury, I think you'll be perfectly satisfied, but unless the Bencoolen/Bugis location is your main goal, or unless you get a particularly good deal on the rate (e.g. priceline), it's not an obvious \"must stay\" hotel to me.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExpensive\u201d", "Author": "GJG3", "ReviewID": "UR120001220", "Content": "I have stayed couple of nights in this hotel while I was in Singapore. its the best location to stay as it is very close to the shopping area but I felt i have paid too much to stayed in a serviced apartment. should have stayed near Orchard road and paid similar amount.

Anyone who has been to Singapore during this time knows that hotels get crazy expensive. The Ibis was good value and one of the cheapest (good quality) hotels around. Location: The hotel is in a brilliant location, littlerally smack in the middle between some of Singapore's greatest locations. Little India / Arab Street / Bugis / Orchard - all within a walk of the hotel. As is the Bugis MRT which then puts you in easy reach of the whole island. If you are staying during the F1 it is possible (and even sometimes quicker) to walk to the City Hall entry gate, we did this one day when we didn't want to take the MRT. Check-In: We arrived reasonably late (around 9:00pm) so didn't have any trouble with check-in, being an AClub member helped as well. Our room was on the 13th floor (bad luck I know), and we were at the very far end of the hallway - so no noise at all. Rooms: The great thing about the Ibis is that they have a drink machine on each floor, I love that, because sometimes you can't be bothered walking downstairs. Our room was an Ibis Standard, no they are not massive but honestly what are you doing spending time in your room for in this city. We were travelling with 2 large suitcases and 2 carry on cases, and with a bit of planning there is plenty of room. Bathroom: Quite a large shower area and the bathroom is big enough to be functional. They don't provide much in the way of toiletries, however there is a 7/11 and a Chemist downstairs so whatever you need you can buy quite easily. Food: We ate at the hotel for the breakfast on our first morning, reasonable price at about SGD$20 per person, however there are so many other options nearby for your meals (check out my review of Kopitiam) that you are doing yourself a disservice eating at the hotel. Overall: This is a great hotel, and I think now our Singapore standard hotel for future stays, its just so well located.

Compared to other Asian city hotels, Singapore hotels rates are high so it made sense to stay in a clean, moderately priced room in a great location. We had single beds as being tall people it gave us a little extra room without colliding with each other in one of the small queens. All the linens and towels were in good condition and the beds comfy. The shower is small but adequate for our needs, a little sink with just a small glass shelve above on the side. The rest of the room was conservative with space and had a table, chair, a small lounge type seat, small flat screen TV and tea/coffee making in one cabinet. Next to that and near the window is a small side cabinet and you needed to stretch sideways to hang things up. Our room was quiet, no corridor or lift noise and overlooked a local temple and it was interesting to see people coming and going. Didn't dine at the hotel and went over to Bugis Junction for a bite at the eateries here. There is a Starbucks,more cafes,many smaller shops and a department store.

In fact, I have to commend the management team for how helpful and upbeat the staff are. I arrived late, required express drycleaning after the cut off time and Jonathan the duty manager made some inquiries and made it happen. Of course, it came with a surcharge but this is normal. The only downside is I got a call at 7am to ask what time I needed it! I do, however, object to late check out charges and how they are calculated. I required a 6pm check out time and was charged a full half day. Given hotels(the Ibis) allow you check in at 2pm and check out at 12 shouldn't I be allowed to stay 11hours after the 12:00pm check out deadline if I am paying a \"half day\". I am actually only staying an extra 6 hours!!! I was also told that if I stayed past the 6pm deadline that I may be subject to \"more charges\" meaning a full day........this is just unacceptable in my view and a complete scam, but that is my opinion and I am not the accountant sitting in the back rooms coming up with these policies. The Ibis will check some person after me and charge full a full day so effectively they will charge a day and half for one full day...nice little scheme! \"Cha Ching\" Also, the selling point of \"free wifi\" is a bit of a stretch given across Asian hotels wifi is just accepted as a norm. Now past my gripes on the half day charges, the staff were helpful, attentive, very polite and very well groomed. The breakfast was good with a wide selection of good food and the amenities are functional.

Room was also not really soundproof. Bathroom was small, there was almost no space from the shower to the WC and to the sink, but it was clean. Very limited TV Channels; if you're a TV Crazy like me you must be really disappointed. I got the 2 single beds, but it could easily arrange by pushing it towards each other to be a king bed.

My tip do not take the breakfast, there's a lot of dining place close to the hotel that open in the morning or some of them even open for 24 hours. I recommend this hotel for those who travels alone without a family since the room is small. Another tip from me, book this hotel like 2-3 weeks before you travel because you will get a really cheaper price than when you just walk in like me.

Overall, the room was clean, but the shower tiles below knee level had mid-dew. Noted a few black bugs started climbing up the shower wall when using the shower the 1st night. Killed some of them with hot water using water from shower head, but others managed to escape and climbed to the ceiling and just stayed there. Therefore, tried to finish the shower asap as I was afraid the bugs might jump to my hair. The shower water was weak, probably due to weak water pressure. Also noted stains on the cover and underside of the Duvit. Called Housekeeping to resolve the both problems. A Supervisor came to assess the bug issue, and immediately opened the cover of the drain and put the shower head into the drain so as to run hot water into the drainage. I told him that his method not only dirtied the shower head but also won't be effective to solve the problem. So he came back with insecticide which I advised against as the poisonous smell would remain in the bathroom and even the room given the closed environment and poor ventilation. So I advised to put Clorox into the drain which he did. Noted that the Supervisor was also very diligent in vacuuming the remaining bugs off the ceiling, and cleaning the Shower Head subsequently. Have not slept well because the bed was a bit hard and not good for back circulation. The next morning, saw 1 new bug on the ceiling and decided I had to change room. I was changed to a room on 16/F. probably because of the high floor, this room didn't have the problems of the previous room except that the drain was very slow in the wash basin. Anyway, hygiene-wise was satisfactory. Unfortunately, the 2nd day came down with an acute medical condition that called for a need to see a doctor. The Customer Service was very helpful to see if I could go to Raffles Hospital to get help. The Duty Manager was also very considerate to extend the Check-out time so that I have enough time to get medical treatment. So overall service was good, but just a pity that they have hygiene issues with the drains. Hope they can resolve the bug problem permanently which might be a challenge given that the hotel is located next to a hawker/food center which inevitably causes hygiene problems in the surrounding drainage system.

There are SO many other options for breakfast in Singapore and I would probably save my money. The nearest MRT station is Bras Basah and is about a 5 minute walk away. The transport network in Singapore is first class and you are never a stone's throw away from an MRT/Bus/Taxi to get you where you want to go. Handy tip: Buy an EZ travel card - we found it saved us money (even more than the $5 cost of the card) even though we were only there for 4 days in total. It was handy to have instead of messing around with single trip tickets or other methods and saw us back and forth to Changi Airport. You can even use the EZ card in some taxis.

It is located right at the back of the Goddess of Mercy Temple which you will find readily on every Singapore map. It is very accessible via the bus which stops right in front of the hotel, or via the Bugis MTR station. There are two ways where you can reach Ibis via MTR: one is through Victoria Street where you walk along the streets of Rochor and Waterloo... while the other, which i find more convenient, is passing through the Bugis Junction Mall right through the Bugis Village. Rooms are large enough to accommodate 2 people. the toilet though is quite small. Service is quite fast. They even posted a \"15-minute service guarantee\" so i guess they are living up to that motto. The staff are friendly and they give good suggestions on where to go and what transport to take.

The Ibis on Bencoolen was quite clean. I had no complaints as far as cleanliness. However, if you are a late riser and like to sleep a lot in the mornings, it is not possible. Each morning around 8 or 9 a.m. and on, the sound of people chatting in the halls, mostly the cleaning staff I believe, was very loud. The accoustics of that hallway aren't very good and you can hear everything. Also the rooms are tiny. The bed was fine, everything was nice and clean but cramped. The bathroom especially is quite small. Also the toiletries provided are very limited - shampoo and soap. No lotion (bring your own) and no conditioner. They have a hair dryer but you have to keep your finger pressed down on the on button the entire time. When you have a lot of long hair, like myself, your thumb can get a cramp. The button is in a very uncomfortable place. Also the only electric plug available in the bathroom is only meant for a men's shaver. So if you want to straight iron your hair or use a curling iron, you have to go by the window and do it. They do provide a tiny refrigerator in the room, good for maybe 2 cans of soda or beer, and the floor is hardwood. Air conditioning worked very well. As with many places in Singapore, it can take a long time to get a taxi. In Singapore it's not easy to get a taxi by hailing one off the street. In most cases they aren't supposed to stop b/c it is dangerous or it blocks traffic. Very different from most big cities. Ibis has a taxi stand and it can take up to 15 min. to get a taxi some times but it can take a really long time as there are long queues in many popular areas of the city (such as Orchard Rd. or tourist attractions). Ibis has some cheap eateries nearby for local food and is not far from little India. The neighborhood is fine, I felt completely safe. Checking in and checking out did not take a long time. The room we chose did not have a good view. If we had to do it over again and in hindsight, I think we might've chosen to stay at a slightly nicer place while paying more per night, although overall Singapore hotel prices are very expensive.

The bathroom amenities are minimal and the towel very small and of poor quality. On the first stay even though it was specified in my booking, they could not provide a queen size bed. I suspect that as I had arrived quite late, about 10pm, that they had given them all to others. I was not impressed as I am over 180cm tall and a fairly big frame. A tiny standard single bed was not good for sleeping. A queen bed was available for my second stay. The breakfast buffet was very busy but had a good selection and light evening snacks were available in the bar. There is a seven eleven store next door for water and snacks etc. if you need them.

But the staff made sure that the earliest available room was given to us. To our surprise we had a room by 10am.

Breakfast buffet is also available at the hotel and it looked good too but we were in the mood for some street food adventure. Super Clean Rooms: The room was small but was sufficient for the two of us. No complaints here as I believe, this is the standard size at all Ibis Hotels. Moreover, I had researched online about the size of the rooms and was ok with it so no bad surprises there. The rooms had all the basic amenities that you would need. However, make sure you carry your own toothpaste, toothbrush and shaving kit as they dont provide any. Rooms, I have to add were super clean and cozy. Excellent air conditioning. There are vending machines on all floors and there are coin operated washers and dryers that you can use which should take care of the laundry needs. Additional Notes: There is a 7-Eleven right next door just in case you need anything. Cons: The rooms could be a little bigger. Though its nothing to complain about. Laundry charges are SGD4 for the wash and SGD4 for the dryer, which I felt was a little too expensive.

Strategically located, this hotel is 5 to 10 mins away (by cab) at the important Marina Bay Financial Center,Orchard Street and Little India (hence Indian food not far away). Recommended for both, business and Leisure travelers, the Ibis on Bencoolen provides all basic requirements. It has a bus stop and a cab stand right outside the hotel. Bedrooms and bathrooms are compact, but not uncomfortable at all. I got everything I asked for.

I found it bland, over priced and not very personal. In all honesty a bit like Singapore itself. But I will keep my review focused on the hotel and not the city. We stayed on the fifth floor with a room that was supposedly big enough for a Queen sized bed. The bed certainly wasn't Queen sized, by my standards. And given the room size itself, an official Queen sized bed couldn't have fitted in it. There was limited storage, an open plan locker type wardrobe affair, fitted into the walls, built with cheaply coated MDF, which incidentally couldn't house a 75 litre backpack, stood up. So, you would certainly struggle with anything bigger than a handbag. There was a safe and a fridge, but the fridge struggled to house a can of coke and it certainly didn't chill anything left in it. There was a LAN connection which repeatedly needed refreshing by the ISP IT help desk. And there was wifi also available. However, this too suffered from constant lock downs and failures. The TV selection was OK, but the signal kept jumping and skipping, I don't think there was a movie channel, but at least you had Discovery to keep you entertained and a few news channels. The bathroom was pokey to say the least and not big enough to swing a cat in. All fittings were moulded into the walls, it almost felt like a porta-loo. There were signs everywhere crowing on about saving the planet, keeping your shower to a maximum of four minutes etc. They came across as bogus and hinted at me, that the hotel wanted to save money by not providing clean linens daily, suggesting that they planted a tree every time someone uses a towel over two days. I'd like to see proof of this Accor Hotels... Housekeeping had to be asked to clean our room on day one, they simply missed us out? There were no comp bottles of water, albeit the tap water was apparently safe to drink. And the restaurant prices were exuberant to say the least. They also served us the wrong dish on our first night. Granted they deducted the bill by 25%, but I later discovered that this was offered to all guests. We never got an apology and were almost made to feel like we were wrong about the mistake made. How does one get confused over the difference between beef and prawns? There was a vending machine at the end of our landing, and to be honest it was fairly priced, given the prices the 7/11 charged next door. But it was cans of soda only This simply felt like the McDonalds of hotels, cheap looking, cheap feeling, cheap everything, except for the nightly price. Another thing as well, it may be best to walk in and book rather than prebook, their rates differ daily, based on occupancy. So, you may get a good deal if you are walking by.

Had frequent dinners at the restaurant although I've always found it strange that such a big international hotel is always quiet for dinners at its restaurant. But recently the hotel, for even stranger reasons, put a LIVE band made up of two kids in, of all strange places, the restaurant. It looks and feels awkward. To make things worse, this supposedly LIVE Band - sing HORRIBLY. The singing is unbearable and pain to the ears. My business members feel the same and it is embarrasing for me to recommend them to dine at the restaurant. It is so loud that it is affecting our hearing and losing our appetite. The female singer is out of tune and screeches most of the time. This is simply noise pollution and the worse LIVE music ambience we have ever experienced. What is the point of putting a band in an awkward place that can't even sing well, and put your guests to such torture? I wondered whoever was the hotel restaurant staff felt good putting the band there, had he or she done their research homework? Was this restaurant staff kidding the Hotel Management or kidding wise, internationally-travelled customers? When we were there, we requested to sit right at the back away from the band - the noise pollution. Then we saw a few other more guests also doing the same, they were asking the restaurant staff to sit them right at the back too. You notice those sitting in front were only the few caucasian beer-drinkers at the TV. This doesn't look very sightly and healthy. Looks more like a cheesy and tacky bar. And because of that, sometimes more horrible things happen - we saw a few girls from outside seeming to talk to these male guests. Does the Hotel Management monitor all these? It looks differently (bad) now. Certainly not what an international hotel should carry itself. I like the Ibis Singapore and I am sure the hotel done a great job in bringing customers to the hotel seeing how busy check-ins can be, but then why would they suddenly do guests a big disfavour by putting a band there in its restaurant? Surely I did not pay to stay at Ibis Hotel to put myself to cheesy band noise pollution. The hotel should accept the fact this is a decent, Ibis restaurant where putting a band there is like forcing a duck to sing. I hope the hotel would look into these issues and improve. The hotel may be filled with customers, but no point for all that success if the hotel doesn't stop to think and care for customers experience. Maybe the Hotel Management needs experienced and intelligent restaurant management. It is very strange that this international hotel is quiet for restaurant covers, but noisy for an unneccessary band. Bring back the peaceful ambience please.

The hotel has a 7-11 & Guardian pharmacy on the premises, which is extremely convenient when you need to pick up odds & ends. The restaurant at the hotel is fairly good (meals are as low as SGD 15), but I would reccomend you go to the food centre at Fortune Centre (right next door) or cross the street and eat at the coffee shop that's right opposite ( i think it's called Al-Jilani). The rooms are basic - comfy bed, flatscreen TV with around 20 channels, desk, free wi fi, safe & tiny fridge. The bathroom is basic as well - don't expect any toiletries.

Overall, it was just okay. Nothing spectacular and nothing flagrant to write home about. I will say that I would not stay here again during future trips to Singapore. Although the hotel is clean and modern, the size of the rooms were extremely small even by Asian hotel standards. You could hardly walk once you and your travel companion and suitcases are inside the room. I had to literally climb over my travel companion\u2019s bed to get to the restroom, because her suitcase was in the pathway because she couldn\u2019t move it anywhere else because there was no more room. The bathroom toiletries consisted of one little soap (I\u2019m assuming this was handsoap that \u201cdoubles\u201d as bath soap), one sanitary trash bag, and shampoo. The vanity could hold, at the most, one toiletry bag (we had to stack ours atop each other\u2019s). As for the beds, they were made for slender and petite people. I\u2019m on the petite side, and when I\u2019d turn over during the night, I\u2019d find that my elbow or knee would be hanging over the side of the bed. It was that narrow. So if you move in your sleep and are of an average or above average size, don\u2019t be surprised if during the night, you find that a limb or two is hanging off the bed. We ate dinner at the hotel once. I guess they were closing for the night, because the wait staff pressured us to place our order ASAP ( I mean literally, as soon as we sat down). The price was quite expensive for the quality and quantity of food we got. I suggest you eat outside the hotel. Next time I go to Singapore, I will pay the extra dollars to upgrade to a hotel with a better location (e.g. Orchard, Clark Quay, etc) and more standard sized rooms.

Two blocks from Kopi Tiam for all your favourite local foods and $5 beers, walking distance to Bugiss Junction shopping, Little India, Orchard Rd, two MRT stops within a five min walk, and a short taxi ride to Clark Quay, Chinatown and 15 min to sentosa.", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cRoom too Small\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR91890273", "Content": "room too small .No porter .Cek in with children and Baby too late. no welcome dring and waiting room", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Egham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood pit stop\u201d", "Author": "iljc82", "ReviewID": "UR91776949", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel back in March 2009 and booked three rooms when it first opened.

Bathrooms (with standing shower area only) were tiny with no amenities except a dispenser for shampoo/bath foam. Still, the hotel probably provides one of the best values in an expensive city like Singapore. It is located just about 250m from the Bugis Junction/MRT area, and in the future will have another link via the new downtown MRT line. Right outside the hotel, there are also a couple of bus stops, from which you can take buses 147 to Clarke Quay/Chinatown, 857 to Raffles Hotel/Suntec City/Helix Bridge and 65 to Orchard Road/Harbour Front/Sentosa.

We're traveling around the world and have stayed at dozens and dozens of hotels from North America, Europe and Asia and this place was not a good memory for us at all. The normal rack rate for the Ibis is S$248 and up ($190 USD) for a tiny 2 twin bed room with no closet, no bathtub, no fridge, no desk, no chair, no view, no luggage rack, no space in general, uncomfortable beds and 1 pillow. Oh btw the hotel has no pool or gym, and a really poor restaurant and offers NO room service. Breakfast is also extra for S$18 a person! I paid online for a special at $135 US for a 7 night stay, thinking this would be a great deal on a nice room for our first trip to Singapore. Upon checking in the clerk was shocked to find out we were staying 7 days, she had no idea why. I guess people only stay here for a day or two, given the cramped quarters I can see why! I cannot imagine paying full price for this hotel, every room is the same too there are no nicer rooms. They are all cheap business traveler rooms, but why they have no desk I don't know. The bathroom was pretty small too for such a pricey room. My husband and I have an internet business and spent a lot of time in our room in between meals working online. We basically had to lay on the bed and work with our stuff pilled up all around us because there was no where to put any of it. We could barely even fit our 2 medium sized luggages on the \"bench\" they have and there's only little cubby holes in a bookshelf like unit to stuff a few belongings. The \"fridge\" is the worst joke I've ever seen. An electric cooler which only fits 2 bottles of water, so forget about having food in the fridge to keep for later. Some of our fruit rotted in the room because we weren't able to put it in the fridge, same with our salad greens. I thought at least for the price we could enjoy something else about the hotel, maybe a pool, or a gym, or a bite to eat. Not possible. I fail to see what is so special about this hotel which offers no amenities or comfort. The restaurant had absolutely no vegetarian food on the menu, which was very strange considering there were 7 vegetarian restaurants in the building next door, and Singapore in general is very vegetarian friendly. So needless to say we could not eat at the hotel restaurant at all. The menu is not really a menu either, you just pick 3 things for a tiny entree meal off of their list and that's what you get. There isn't a full menu to pick a proper meal and they don't even have garden salads on the menu either, strange. The maid service here frustrated us to no end. They would walk into our rooms immediately after knocking between 9 and 10am and we'd scream and then they'd say oh sorry and go away. So we started going to bed with the do not disturb sign on the door. When we would leave before lunch time we'd put the make up room sign on the door and come back 3 - 4 hours later to find out the room had not been made at all! They did not come back to clean our room until almost 4 pm every day! WHAT? When they finally came in I went downstairs to use the restaurant washroom and came back and the beds were made and we had new towels. Obviously it takes them 5-10 minutes to service a room, so having to wait until 4 pm every day to get cleaned is ridiculous, that or having it cleaned at 9 am when you're still sleeping. Neither works well. So as we needed to use the room the majority of the afternoon this was very frustrating for us because the garbages needed to be taken out and we needed new towels and it was not comfortable. The only good thing about our stay at the Ibis was the fact that it is in a good location for getting some fresh juice, vegetarian foods, and checking out the local area where you can find pretty much anything else you need in Singapore to shop for.

Ibis Bencoolen is a new hotel, unfortunately the staff they hired are appaulingly rude. I've had two stays in this hotel within the last month for 3-4 days each stay. Both make me question why I bother booking through Advantage Plus. On the more recent stay, we'd asked for a Queen bed room, which was aavailable when we booked it on the Advantage Plus website, but they'd allocated that room to a walk in instead of locking it out (the point of paying for it via the Advantage Plus website). When confronted, the staff said that they would just give us a twin share room (the two single beds pushed together). This really isn't a big deal, but for a young, active couple, it is. Secondly, we booked the queen bed. Why was it given to a walk in? The attitude of the staff the next day when we requested to speak with the Front Office Manager was basically well the staff told you they'd just give you the twin share room. Seriously? A manager gives you that response? I know what they said, but why did it happen when the booking clearly said (that they had a copy of) we'd booked and paid for a queen bed. Both stays have left a stain on us as service is important, more than the room quality. If the management of this Ibis would put as much effort into look and feel of the hotel as they did for the selection of the staff, this would be a great place. The rudeness and arrogance of most of the staff is big let down for this hotel. The rooms are great though, well laid out and everything you need feature wise (including free internet). As long as the end to end reservation is fine, and you don't need to deal with the staff, it's a great place to stay. Due to the service and the price (very expensive for Ibis), you'd be better off paying a few dollars extra to stay at Novotel, which is what we will be doing on our next stay.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFANTASTIC\u201d", "Author": "Lionel W", "ReviewID": "UR88590550", "Content": "I always try to find that sweet spot where the value you get for the money you spend leaves you satisfied. Singapore was hard as hotels here are more expensive than other Asian destinations. Last time in Singapore we were with out two adult children and stayed at the Grand Cairnhill with a two bedroom apartment. This time however it was just the wife and I. I booked through \"OTEL.COM\" and the cost was a bit under $150 Australian. The deal worked in my favor as they deal in Euros and the Australian dollar was so strong. The hotel was busy, very busy, but the staff were fast and efficient. We were there a couple of hours early and I was ready to have to put our bags aside and wander off for the couple of hours. However the room was ready and within 2 to 3 minutes we were in our room. Not sure if they have a porter but we took our own bags to our room. When we wanted to go on a tour we simply asked the reception staff and they arranged them. If they couldn't do it at the time because there are minimum numbers needed for tours they would follow it up and leave a message in your room or phone you when it was done. The room itself is small with wood look laminate floors and the bathroom is very small and can only take one person at a time. The water was hot and strong. The fridge is a baby which can only hold about 6 cans and there is only a small space to hang clothes. Now you might think that I am going negative about this but the room is clean, neat and modern. The wife and I both loved it. The mattress had the usual hardness that they have in hotels but although I have a bad back and neck I slept quite well, in fact as well as I have slept anywhere in the numerous Asian destinations that I have visited. We also liked the location and you can even walk to the Raffles but I would recommend an \"as the crow flies\" route as you then go through shopping complexes which keeps you cool. Little India and Bugis Street and very short walks away, as is the the SIM complex (electronics). There are two SIMS buildings, the closest one is much bigger and the one I refer to. The room also had internet which came in very handy due to a sick animal at home and getting updates etc. The breakfast was a very good selection and the eating area was clean and modern. In the photos I was worried that it looked a bit like a cheap cafe. I was wrong as the area is perfectly done with a modern look. We chose to eat breakfast outside the main breakfast area as we sat by the window watching the \"world go by\". We also ate in this area in the evening and the food was wonderful. Whilst you can try food in Little India or Bugis Street the quality of the food at the Hotel was vastly superior and although more expensive they were better size servings. I don't believe that the hotel has a poll but in all the hotels I have been to I have only been in the pool once which was in Thailand. My overall thought about this hotel.........FANTASTIC. We still have things to tick off our Singapore list of \"things to do\" and will definately stay at this hotel again. If this is the standard you get with IBIS then I will also look at them in other destinations.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai", "Title": "\u201cgood business hotel in singapore\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR88551780", "Content": "good budget business hotel in singapore with convenient location", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel To Stay For (\"Short Business Trip -Purpose Only\")\u201d", "Author": "SridharV", "ReviewID": "UR88396150", "Content": "IBIS Hotel: Benibis Singapore on Bencoolen- Good Budget Hotel To Stay For Short Business Purpose Date: 15-17 November 2010 Our Company has booked for all our collegues coming for various countries for 3 days stay .

I e-mailed them and surprisingly someone responded and help me out. Salut to Ms Geraldine! Checking in was amazingly efficient even compare to Sofitel. The hotel itself nearer to city centre. You can take subway by walking around 10-15 mins to Bugis MRT Station thru Prince Albert park, a street market I forget its name, and Bugis Junction shopping mall. The hotel locates in Bencoolen Link about 15-20 minutes drive to Changi Airport and to Orchard Road.

About the room, I think it is 5x6 metres with ensuite bathroom, in-room safe, 21 inch lcd television, a cooler, and wardrobe without doors. Well, you can find less variety on their TV channels and breakfast menus. God, you can imagine if you stay here for a week like what i had last year. Avoid breakfast since you easily find food stalls, restaurants, and fast food restaurants walk away from Ibis.

The room we were in wasn't huge but was more than big enough for our needs. The shower has a sliding glass door that kept the rest of the bathroom dry, there is a handy shelf over the sink however some of the towels were a bit thin and could do with being replaced. The bed was very hard, not just firm and could be a bit uncomfortable for some. There is tea and coffee making gear in the room. There is a room safe and the fridge is tiny (big enough for for cans of Tiger and a small container of milk). The bar staff were great, there was a good selection of beer, wine and spirits on hand and happy hour runs from 3 to 8 pm and is a 2 for 1 offer. The only thing I would like would be more lounge chairs around the bar so you can sit more comfortably and relax a bit more. The restaurant starts at the end of the bar and has a good selection of both snack and full meals. Service was quick although some of the food could have been hotter (heat not spice). It also has an asian \"tapas\" type meal selection of local foods. Breakfast has a good selection including fresh fruit, breads, pastries, cereals, bacon and eggs and noodles etc and was restocked often. There is a 7/11 at one end of the hotel ground floor and a chemist at the other end.

It had a flat screen tv, a desk and of course a bed which was functional and comfortable as well. The bathroom had a shower and was compact, but did its purpose nonetheless. There are no bathtubs here, but at least, the shower area had a glass partition between it and the toilet to prevent the entire bathroom from being wet. Initially, I had difficulty dealing with the faucet because only hot water was coming out. I had to call the maintenance and they came in after about 15 minutes. Funny, but all he had to do was switch the sticker from lef to right since the blue color which indicates \"cold water\" was positioned wrongly (it was on the side of the hot water). He was also kind enough to tell me how to use the faucet. My room came with free buffet breakfast and unlimited wifi, which incidentally was my main reason for choosing this hotel, apart from it being close to my area of business. The breakfast was okay, there was enough selection for anyone, although it can get tiring after the 2nd day, since they pretty much serve the same thing. I looove their coffee. The unlimited use of the internet was great and the speed was just right. Getting a cab from this area is easy, my longest wait was 5 minutes. Chinatown and bugis market is just a few blocks away, very good for those who want to get good bargains. There are a couple of sights to see nearby, like a Chinese temple and a museum. Check out took about 15 minutes. I paid in cash and while they mentioned that they will cancel the reservation they made with my credit card provider at the start of my stay, to this day, they still haven't. which reminds me, I need to call them again.

I booked this place partly because it was about the cheapest Hotel available in Singapore for this period and it had pretty good reviews on Trip Advisor. Check In: The main entrance to the hotel is from the back lane which is pretty funny, but because Bencoolen Street is out front this makes more sense. The check-in was quite efficient and no hassles, we were in a room on the 15th floor had a view across Bencoolen Street. Location: This hotel is in a great location, within a couple of minute walk to Bugis Street Markets and also Bugis Street MRT it is really handy. Also it is only about a 10minute walk to City Hall from here, sometimes we didn't bother with the MRT and just walked. If you are coming for the F1 this is a great hotel as its far enough out of the marina area to be a bit cheaper but still really really close to the action. Room: Hotel IBIS are not exactly known for huge rooms but honestly it was more than sufficient for 2 people and all our Luggage. The bed was firm which is to be expected from most asian hotels, there was a writing desk which had a great view and was actually quite nice to sit at and use the laptop. The hotel provide free wifi, its not super fast but its enough for browsing the net and sending emails etc. The Bar Fridge is tiny - like 4 cans of drink tiny! Thankfully the 7/11 Downstairs is right next door so you can just pop down and buy supplies as needed, and most floors have a vending machine which is handy. Noise wasn't a real problem, occasionally you could hear loud people walking and talking the corridors at night but not so much that it annoyed me. The cleaning service was quite good and they were very efficient. Breakfast: The breakfast is a buffet style and is about $18SGD so really good value, can't complain it had all the main things that you come to expect, had a kind of youth hostel vibe to the restaurant, but thats cool. Overall: Quite a comfortable hotel, nothing to really complain about - can't even think of anything that was annoying or troublesome.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Location & Great Service\u201d", "Author": "Peachey_007", "ReviewID": "UR82134756", "Content": "We travelled to Singapore for the Formula 1 and a spot of shopping and R&R.

Being a smoker, I appreciate that they have smoking rooms. The room was a tad smaller than the one in Phuket and naturally doesn't have a balcony. I like the modern decor, bed is to my liking and flatscreen TV is a plus. Toilet has no bathtub, which is no problem... since I take showers. Used the express laundry service with no problems at all. Being a professional trader, the free wireless internet connection is a definite clincher. All-in-all...

We chose this hotel because of the great reviews on Tripadvisor. We were expecting the room to be small as mentioned in some of the reviews but I guess it depends on what you are used to. We found the room to be perfect. There was plenty of room for the both of us to move around and there was ample room for our luggage. The bathroom was good and our room was cleaned every day. The housekeeping service was very good and very prompt. We arrived late at night (about 4am) but I had let the hotel know about that when I booked so they were expecting us. I had asked for a room on one of the lower floors when I booked and I was told that they couldn't guarantee that until the day of check-in. When we did arrive, we were able to get a room on the 5th floor which was to our full satisfaction. I booked through the Internet so I was able to get the double room with no breakfast for approximately $137 (Australian) back in April 2010. As my Tripadvisor fellow travellers had suggested, there was no need to pay for breakfast because the hotel was so close to so many cheap food places anyway. It was with great satisfaction that we noted the Ibis's advertised daily rate outside the hotel while we were there as $258 (Singaporean) per night which would convert to approximately $232 (Australian)!! The location was excellent. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel and the Bugis St Juntion for the underground train is a very short walk away as well. The visitors' information centre is also on your way to the train station. It is also close to department stores, shopping centres and the markets. I will certainly go back to the Ibis on Bencoolen and thank you Tripadvisor for all the information.

Room servicing missed a few items on different days (tea and coffee on one day and face washers on another), but calls to housekeeping proved that the Ibis \"15 minute guarantee\" for fixing problems works. We included breakfast with our stay and thought that the breakfast range was much wider than in many other Ibis hotels - in addition to cereal, pastries, toast and fruit, on the 4 mornings we stayed the hot selection comprise bacon, hash browns, chicken sausages, scrambled eggs plus a couple of Asian breakfast offerings which varied from day to day. Some great positives: * The Ibis on Bencoolen is in a great location and within walking distance (if it's not raining) of many of Singapore's tourist attractions. * If it is raining, the hotel is very well serviced with taxis - we never bothered to book a taxi and the longest wait we had was 5 minutes. There is a bus stop outside the door, and the Bugis MRT station is only a 5 minute walk away. * There are 3 free internet terminals in the lobby for guests to use. A few minor quibbles/cautions/advices: * the minute fridge was not very efficient and was definitely not cold enough to keep milk in for your coffee/tea * The 4 lifts serve all 16 floors, so at busy times there can be a small wait for a lift. I thought it would have been better if at least one lift was dedicated as an express lift to the upper floor, * Only two irons and ironing boards are provided for the whole hotel (in the laundry on the 3rd floor), but the irons didn't work very well, and * Suggest getting cold drinks from the dispensing machines on each floor than from the bar (they are a quarter of the price).

No options for vegetarians in anycase. 6. Super tiny cooler. Couldn't even fit an Orange Juice tetrapack. 7. Terrible TV quality. The LCD TV itself is small.

We loved the city and distant harbour view from our window and the location of the hotel was ideal, mere steps from the Bugis shopping area, temples and MRT station. I knew this was a budget hotel and therefore wasn't expecting much, so I was surprised that we were able to check in at 10:30 am and extend our check-out the following day until 1 pm. The reception staff was extremely helpful and efficient and the concierge went out of his way to help us secure bookings on a harbour cruise and to arrange our city tour for the following day. I was afraid noise would be an issue as we heard our neighbors talking in the room next door, and this seems to be a very busy hotel, but we were so tired it wasn't a problem. Our room had fantastic AC (always important to me!) . There was very little space for luggage, but this wasn't a problem for us as we'd left our luggage at the airport and were traveling with small bags. We found the lightswitch on the wall outside the bathroom an awkward arrangement, but other than that and the tiny room size, no complaints. We took advantage of the hotel's Happy Hour (from 3-8 pm), and we had dinner in the hotel's restaurant, Taste.

It seemed like a good deal. It was. The hotel advertises as being a budget hotel, but it's a step up. It's not exactly budget price but it's close enough and there's great advantages to paying a little extra. First off, the bed really is kinda hard. But don't let that fool you, because it actually wasn't a bad bed to sleep on. That surprised me. The hotel itself is exceptionally clean. The rooms were clean also. It's still a fairly new hotel. Checking in and out was nearly effortless. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful anytime I needed them. There is no alarm clock in the room, but the wake up call was easy to get and was timely. They also had a taxi waiting for me at 3:30am when I needed to get to the airport for an early flight. I didn't try the restaurant downstairs, but the bar was well run and had tvs usually playing Premiership football when I passed by. The drinks were good and surprisingly cheaper than expected. The location is really good, right on Bencoolen and next to multiple bus stops, but it is a slight walk to the MRT. I was using Dhoby Gaut for the first few days but I feel Bugis was probably closer. It was about 10 minutes to Bugis, maybe 15 to Dhoby. They are on two different lines, so that could make a difference to you as well. You have to have the room key to get to the room floors and to run anything in the room including the A/C. Coming back from all day outside, it can be pretty warm in the room, but it cools down fairly quickly. I had no problems with the bathroom/shower. I didn't get the bathroom all wet from the strange shower door and floor arrangement. I would have had to leave the door wide open or turn the shower head a certain way to have done that. The bay window and office desk area was nice. The tv was efficient. The only thing I'd say negative, the refrigerator is way too small. It holds three cans of drink or three small bottles of water.

The hotel is a work of beautiful smallness and efficiency, suggesting we habitually consume more than we should. The Ibis provided just enough and no more. There was a safe, coffee maker, and a refrigerator which would be called \"imut-imut\" in the Indonesian language (translates as cute-because-it's-small). It would hold only a few items, but we would rather the hotel save electricity with a cold small refrigerator than with a cool normal-sized one. We had a room on the 8th floor overlooking the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts' courtyard, which was fine for the price. The room was clean and of adequate size for us. The TV was good with reasonable selection of channels. The bed was hard--just right for my wife who needs strong back support, but I felt a backache that disappeared 5 minutes after I started moving around. There was no noise of footsteps from above, but some neighbors slammed their doors and chatted in the halls. I think it is hard to fault a hotel for its guests whose parents never taught them to consider their unseen neighbors. It was easy to regulate the room temperature, so we didn't wake up in a sweat under the heavy blanket. One of the best features in the Ibis was the free wi-fi in the room with a strong signal and an easy password. There are also two free computer stations in the lobby. The location near Bugis MRT station is very good, and there are convenience and other stores nearby. With prepaid booking on the website, the room cost us $118 without breakfast--a good deal in Singapore. They promote the current room rate on a sign by the sidewalk. The staff were not only friendly and helpful, they were very competent. They froze our ice packs in a freezer near reception and kept our suitcases for 5 hours in a locked storage room, also by reception. They let us check out at 1 p.m., an hour later than usual. We had coffee and cakes at the hotel's Taste Restaurant. The surroundings were large and tasteful (one has the feeling it was designed for tour group breakfasts), it was uncrowded when we were there, and the food was good but higher priced than at nearby places. As hotel tariffs in Singapore remain high, we have tried to cope by trying out less expensive hotels outside of the Orchard Road area. The Ibis Bencoolen has excellent facilities and location for our needs, near the Queen Street durian stalls and near Bugis Street where items for tourists are still cheap and there is an MRT station (which is fortuitously on the MRT East-West line that goes directly to Changi airport).

I chose this hotel based on price that I booked through the hotels website for around $85. That is cheap in Singapore! Since most of the write ups here are about the hotel facilities, let me give you instead tips on what was not mentioned. TIP #1: If you plan to ride the bus and MRT (Metro Rail Transit), purchase an EZ-Link Card (much like the Octopus Card of Hong Kong) at the Airport MRT. Purchase at the counter of the MRT near the gantries. By the way, in Singapore, if you take the bus and MRT, infants and small children ride for free! Learn how to use EZ-Link card at http://www.transitlink.com.sg/images/bus/ezLink-eng10.pdf Note: If you take the bus to most of the tourist destinations using EZ Link, your card credit would most likely be deducted by SG$ 0.69 only, meaning, that is how small of what you pay. I was able to reach the hotel from the airport for only SG$ 1.70! How? Well I simply took the MRT (and yes, along with a luggage), costing me around SG$ 1.70 only (compared to SG$ 25-35 if you take a taxi). By taking the MRT, I avoided traffic and reached Bugis MRT for only 20 minutes. MRT in Singapore is clean and not that crowded in my experience. Here is how I did, from the Airport (Terminal 2) MRT, I alighted at Bugis MRT. After exiting MRT, I simply walked to the hotel and it felt like I simply walked for around 300 meters (for me, that\u2019s really not a long distance) and got to the hotel without any fuss if you avoid the night market by passing along Rochor Road until you reach Waterloo St., turn left and when you reach Bencoolen Link Street, turn right and after a few meters, your there at the back entrance of the hotel. All that walk felt like around 8-12 minutes of leisure walk. Try looking at your walk path through google maps. In front of the hotel, I was surprised to see two bus stops which I found rare for a hotel in Singapore. Each bus stop has different destinations. Taking a bus in Singapore is really convenient, and inexpensive. Bus drivers here, in my experience, are considerate and waits until everybody is seated or in proper place. TIP#2: If you prefer to get around by MRT from Ibis Hotel with less walk: In front of Ibis hotel is bus stop: called: Opposite Burlington Square, Ride bus no. 65 and on the 3rd bus stop, alight at Dhoby Ghaut Station bus stop. Walk a few and your there at Douby Ghaut MRT Station. Otherwise, you could simply walk to Bugis MRT which is the nearest MRT that is not conveniently accessible by bus from the bus stop in front of Ibis. Let me share the bus routes I discovered: Bus and walk path to Chinatown Heritage Center: Wait at front of Ibis hotel bus stop called Fortune Center Bus Stop (take note, there are two bus stops in front of the hotel, the other is called Opposite Burlington Square bus stop). Ride bus # 147. On the 8th bus stop, alight at New Bridge Center bus stop. Walk back crossing Smith St. Walk further and turn right at Temple St. Turn left at Trengganu St. Find CHC there. Bus to Suntec City Convention Center (if you plan to purchase your tickets for the Singapore Flyer and/or Duck Tour): At bus stop: Fortune Center ride bus no. 857. On the 5th bus stop, alight at Suntec Convention Center bus stop. By the way, below Suntec is the City Link Mall which you may leisurely walk through going to Esplanade. From here, if you purchase your Singapore Flyer, they offer free bus ride, take it as it is quite a walk! Bus and MRT to Singapore Zoo: If you prefer not to walk to Bugis MRT, in front of Ibis hotel, at bus stop: Opposite Burlington Square, Ride bus no. 65 and on the 3rd bus stop, alight at Dhoby Ghaut Station bus stop. Ride the Dhoby Ghaut MRT to ANG MO KIO MRT. Upon reaching Ang Mo Kio MRT Station, head towards the right after you have passed through the ticket gantries. There is an underground tunnel link (to Ang Mo Kio Bus Interchange / AMK Hub). Enter it via the escalator. Head to Bus Berth 1, which is all the way to the other end, where bus # 138 is located. Available are overhead notices to direct you along. Ride Bus #138 to the zoo. The zoo is the last destination of the bus. TIP#3: To avoid the long line to purchase your Zoo entrance tickets. Purchase your tickets ahead at the Ibis Concierge and he even gives you a discount. He also gives discount to other tickets to many attractions as well. Bus and MRT to SINGAPORE SCIENCE CENTER: Ride the MRT to JURONG EAST MRT Station. Then transfer to bus no. 335 located just outside the MRT or walk to Science Centre Singapore as it is just an 8-minute walk from the Jurong East MRT Station. BUS TO ORCHARD ROAD: In front of IBIS hotel, at bus stop: Opposite Burlington Square, ride bus no. 65. On the 7th bus stop, alight at bus stop: Opposite Orchard Station (at Orchard Blvd). Walk forward until the pedestrian lane, cross the road and walk towards WISMA ATRIA SHOPPING CENTER. Enter the mall to reach Orchard Road which is on the other end of the mall. To Sentosa: Ride the MRT to HARBOURFRONT MRT Station. Once you alight you are actually at the Vivo City Mall. There, you have 4 choices to reach Sentosa Island. You may take the cable car (which was not operational when we were there), Express Tram, Bus or you could simply walk. I preferred the tram; it\u2019s more exciting than bus. Ok enough with bus routes. Now about the hotel. There is no bell boy. You can use the hotel's many carts (much like the ones in the airport) to bring your luggages to your room yourself. The hotel does not give newspaper in the morning. I happen to have the habit of knowing what\u2019s happening around when I am sitting on the toilet. On time, my wife and daughter was out for shopping, I simply opened the bathroom door to watch CNN on TV which is situated in front of you when sitting on the toilet, hahahaha.........what a way to know the news!!!! (and yes, I can use the TV remote in that distance and change to BBC, STAR Sports, HBO and others) There are many Catholic Churches, temples and mosques near Ibis, simply ask the concierge on the location and mass schedules. If you want to eat and savour the local dishes of Singapore, the hotel has a restaurant: TANG which I tried and found relatively expensive and the serving is too small for the price, SG$ 15 for 3 very small dishes. Believe me, for a better tasting food and one that will save you a lot, head to KOPITIAM Food Court which is 2 blocks away at the corner of Bras Basah Road and Bencoolen St. If you do not want to walk 2 blocks, eat at SIM LIM Food Court. Otherwise, if you are adventurous and want to try out how the locals do, head to Albert Court Food Court which is located a few meters when exiting at the back entrance of Ibis. Eating venues are aplenty and actually in very close proximity! Burger King is located at the opposite building of Ibis (near SIM LIM). Another Burger King is at the end of the Bugis Night Market corner Victoria St. McDonald\u2019s is located at the corner of Queens St. and Rochor Road. KFC is located at the corner of Victoria St. and Rochor Road. 7-11 convenience store is beside the entrance of IBIS and at the other end of the hotel is The Guardian, a drug store. Bugis Junction Mall is just across the Bugis MRT. When you are in Singapore, you\u2019ve got to try the Hainesse Chicken, Kopi (local coffee), Roti Prata with Curry Sauce and the Red Bean with ice dessert. And by the way, if you want to take out what you order, never use the line: \u201ctake home\u201d or \u201cto go\u201d or \u201ctake out\u201d, always use \u201ctake away\u201d :) Your option for other hotels near Ibis is Bayview, Hotel 81 on Bencoolen, Somerset. If your flight is late in the evening. The hotel offers half rate (of the posted Hotel rate) if you prefer to extend until 6 PM. I requested until 7 PM and they agreed. Otherwise, head to Changi airport (I think it is at Terminal 2) where inside there is a hotel by the name of Ambassador Transit Hotel. In this airport hotel, they offer a wide selection of inexpensive services. You can get a room for 3 hours or you may simply take a bath or even use the swimming pool at a very inexpensive rate. Otherwise, you may kill time as Changi airport has a mall inside it.", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dundalk, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cIf you want to sleep - don't stay at this hotel\u201d", "Author": "Chozz", "ReviewID": "UR52811125", "Content": "We had originally booked for 5 nights but checked out after the first.

The hotel was overbooked and I had no alternative other than checking out and finding another hotel and paying all over again. I had already paid too much in UK and their local rates were so much less. Breakfast was hopeless. It was advertised as an international hotel but there was no vegetarian options at all. I had to go to next door restaurent. On one evening I wanted to go out and no taxi was in the taxi rank, so I asked for them to either call a taxi for me or give me a phone number.

A couple of Koffitiam food courts within a few hundred yards, the one opposite the Rendevous hotel was our favourite where you can get a noodle or curry dish for $3-$4. The Sim lim electrical bazaar is 7 floors of electrical heaven (according to my husband!) and the Bugis market is great for bargain souvenirs and kept me busy for hours :) Both were close by as was Little India although there was some construction going on and at times was difficult for our wheelchair user going up and down the pavements. We used the hop on hop off bus with the Singapore Airlines discount which was definately worth the $6 to get an overview and we visited the zoo and botanical gardens - both recommended.

Conclusion: Alot of hassle for a few extra bucks but enough to annoy 2 pretty easy-going travelers. For SGD 175 a night, we would have stayed at another hotel in singapore.

Singapore was less expensive then - it was back in 2002 but the memory was still fresh enough to quickly realize that it had absolutely nothing to do with the Ibis. The Ibis is a budget hotel, and it shows everywhere from the long corridors, the room and even the toilet paper. There is a positive side to that as well as many things are free or inexpensive. Staying at the Ibis is very much like eating at Burger King when traveling in a foreign country \u2013 it gives a sense of familiarity, looks clean and has nothing to do with where you are. Seems like the concept is working well and the hotel was quite busy. Location is good, although it looked quite deserted at first glance. The Bugis street market is a couple of minutes away and Bugis Junction is right behind it. MRT connection is not that great though if you need to go to the office in the morning, and I used taxis most of the time. I stayed here twice, and would recommend a lower floor for anyone who prefers to spend time in his room rather than in the elevator. Something not quite tuned properly there. The best thing going for the Ibis is that it's new, so obviously the rooms are new as well. Beware the unbelievably hard bed! This alone would make me think twice before I decide to stay here again. The wireless connection is free, and there are vending machines on every floor. Breakfast was ok, but not included in my room rate, so after the first day I looked for other options. Here's a $5.35 alternative to the $17+ hotel breakfast: Get a can of orange juice from the vending machine ($1.10) and take it with you to the Burger King across the street for breakfast ($4.25).

The tiny flaw about the hotel is that not all the staffs are very knowledgeable. Once, we were served by a staff named Mel.

We also had a hard time trying to understand her when she tried to explain about our bills as we only wanted to know whether it\u2019s possible to separate room and miscellaneous charges. It was so much easier to understand the girl who had checked us in. A very petite Philippine girl (I think she is one as she looks the same as those Philippines girls as we had just came from there) who exude the confidence of how a service staff should be when she professionally checked us in and explained the different taxes incurred. I must also praise the Concierge boys as they had gave us very good recommendation of places to visit and was very prompt in anticipating our needs.

From the airport, it\u2019s less than 20SGD to get to the hotel or if you travel on a budget, you can take the MRT from Changi Airport, with a convenient connection at Tanah Merah interchange to Bugis. The hotel is about a 5 minute stroll away. For many travellers to Singapore, the city is reduced to the area around Orchard Road which really only shows you the up market shopping that one can do. While Singaporeans enjoy a stroll along Orchard Road, their shopping, eating and leisure takes place elsewhere. The area around Bugis is therefore a much better representation of the true Singapore. Great location for walking to any of the following: Sim Lim for your tech needs, Bugis MRT station which is one stop away from City Hall interchange, SMU (Singapore Management University), 15 minutes to Chimes and Raffles City Mall, 10 minutes to Raffles Hospital, Bugis Junction and Iluma Mall are a couple of blocks away. The hotel is right next to Albert St. Pedestrian Mall and the Bugis Night Market. The location of the hotel allowed us to walk everywhere and all around there are street stalls, food halls and a 7/11 just next door; and even a Burger King across the road. We love hawker food and so stuck with the street stalls which are infamous in Singapore. To Orchard Road you\u2019d have to take the MRT and go via City Hall interchange or else take a taxi, but nothing is too far away. To the Esplanade Mall/ Concert Hall it\u2019s about a 10 minute taxi ride also. Remember that this is an Ibis so it just covers all your basics. There is no swimming pool or gym but the breakfast was vast, the rooms clean and the hotel has free wireless and wired internet. They also have self laundering facilities on the 3rd floor with the charge being 4SGD for a load of wash and 4SGD for load in the dryer (the machines only accept 1SGD coins). Whenever we go to Singapore, we normally stay near Orchard Road and take the MRT to Bugis, but when we found that the Ibis opened in Bugis we were keen to try it and with the rate that they were offering (118SGD June 11-15 2009) it made our decision even easier.

I aimed was to find one with cheap price, nice-looking interior, convenient location, preferable new, and preferable without much hotel factilities (e.g pools, gym). This ibis hotel fits all my requirements. The price is among the lowest in hotels in Singapore! It's kind of no-frills hotel without any facilities except for the restaurant (I won't need a pool or gym or business center in my solo leisure trip anyway) and hence the lower price. The hotel is still very new and the lobby decoration is decent. The check-in is very fast; I waited for 2 minutes, and then took 3-4 minutes before I start moving my lugguage to the room at 8/F. The room simple yet very nice. Everything is still very new. Size of room is okay for 2 person (hence very spacious for one), with plenty of space for placing lugguage and plenty of desk space for placing belongings during the stay. Since there are no tall buildings near the hotel, the room is very well lit during daytime even without any lights on. Toilet size is, again, OK for a 'budget' hotel, enough room to stand 3-4 person. Water pressure for both basin and shower is strong and the temperature of the water is manageable (i.e. not those 'either-very-hot-or-very-cold type). Toilet flush button is so big that a man without fingers can push them. No conditioner nor toothpaste/toothbrush is provided though. The shower is big enough for two person (didn't try - too bad) and the floor tiles has edges a bit too sharp. The bed is comfortable. The pillow is a bit soft - I asked if there are less soft pillows but the staff told me there is one type of pillow for the hotel. (Too bad, but acceptable for budget hotel.) The surroundings: MANY restaurant/eating places! There are three shopping center with big food courts filled with chain restaurants (e.g. pizza hut, KFC, etc) within 5 minutes walk; two food courts with local food a street away; some budget food in the Fortune Center just next to the hotel; a street with bar and nice (expensive) restaurant also a street away; and also a few nice-looking restaurant in this and nearby hotels. Finding food is not a problem. There is even a 24-hour local restaurant across the street. Besides food, there are shopping malls, busy market street, convenient stores and hawkers - good if you like to stay near a busy area. It is still busy by 9pm, but become very quiet by 11pm. To conclude, it's a very decent hotel (if you're only need a nice room). Location is convinent, close to MRT, food and shoppings. Room is cosy and NEW. Complimentary wireless internet gives me enough reason to stay; most hotel in singapore need $$$$$ for the internet. I didn't talk much to the staff during the stay, but for those limited occassions (checkin, checkout and asking for harder pillow) they are very responsive and kind. A longer opening hour of the hotel restaurant would be nice though - it closes at 10pm - it's closed when I return to hotel after seeing shows. Also, it'd be nice if I could choose double bed or twin bed on the online booking service - I can only ask for availability of double bed room upon arrival.", "Date": "May 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hardwar", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Nikiashu", "ReviewID": "UR30017385", "Content": "Excellent Location with Most Economical Prices for the quality accomodation in singapore is something made me stay at this property.

That wasn't available when I booked, but at S$138 I thought it was pretty good value, as in past years $200 wouldn't guarantee you all that much, and with the Aussie dollar down the drain I wanted something reasonable. I stayed 4 nights and my simple conclusion was that this was Singapore's best value hotel. Having often stayed down in Clarke Quay, I was surprised how good the Bencoolen Street location was. For work I was able to walk down to Raffles Place in less than 20 minutes, much less if I took the train. But what really clinched the location was night-time activities and shopping. Just behind the hotel is an incredible all-day and all-night market selling everything from fresh fruit to crafts, clothes and incense. The incense is needed because there are two temples there - Hindu and Chinese temples, dating back to the 19th century. Then you have more shops and markets leading all the way to Bugis Street and Bugis Village (5 minutes away). Across the road from the Ibis is Sim Lim Square, where I bought two DS games that were loaded with over 50 games and could be connected to the internet for more games (I was sceptical about all of this, but fortunately they worked when I got home or my children would have murdered me). But I really love the old Singaporean shop-houses and within five minutes walk you could take in Albert Court and the remarkable Little India, where the food is amazingly authentic (and cheap). On the subject of food, the Ibis' TASTE restaurant is remarkable. The menu features 20 of Singapore's best-known dishes - put together by a fellow called Seetoh, who is - or so I was told - Singapore's \"Food Ambassador\", whatever that means. Food is great, nicely presented and three tapas dishes cost $15. For an Ibis, this hotel is quite swish. Rooms are typically compact, but very comfortable with all the typical room inclusions. But what really got me was the FREE WIFI - if a cheapie hotel like Ibis can do it, why are all the 5-star Sing hotels ripping us off?

I know it is a small point, but it is one of the reasons I stayed there. Also on the downside, the property is between two subway stops, and that means at least 15 minute walk to the MRT transport. This was a problem in the heat and the downpours. The Bencoolen area is dicey and there is really no nice decent places to eat around the hotel. There are places, but they seemed dirty and low end.

A friend recommended me to their online contest to publicize the hotel called Pay What You Want. Since I was coming to Singapore on vacation with family, I booked 3 nights using this scheme at very low rates [S$25~$35]. This was a steal. The location is great - very close to shopping and decent eating joints. It is also centrally located to Bugis and City Hall metros. The room with a queen size bed was decent as was the bathroom. The in-room fridge is very small - can't hold a 1 litre water bottle. The safe didn't work as per the instructions and they couldn't get it fixed. The regular rate of S$148 is also pretty good. I would recommend it to others.", "Date": "February 28, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1229624-Reviews-Ibis_Singapore_on_Bencoolen-Singapore.html", "Price": "$132 - $207*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "1229624", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/b1/c3/34/clean-comfortable-standard.jpg"}}
