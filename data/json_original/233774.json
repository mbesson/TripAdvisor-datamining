Well except for the banner on the wall, it is not a four star. Let's say a 3. The reception makes you feel as you were in a 'near to the railway station' hotel although everything' s clean and the personnel is helpful. The scary elevator brings you to your floor where you reach your room through a very small aisle. The (superior) room as such is very small but ok. In the morning you can take your breakfast in the basement.

The view on the balconies of the beautiful parisien architecture...just magic. The breakfast was a little bit disappointing, because I always had good experiences in Paris with food...but not this time. There was not a lot of choice, the staff...well...there were no waitresses at all! So you couldn't order anything. Another minus for this hotel is definitely the position...let's say 15minutes from the metro, so after walking all the day along Paris...you almost die until coming to the hotel.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Precy sur Oise, France", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel for Paris, despite what other reviewers may have said\u201d", "Author": "hilandwil", "ReviewID": "UR116062470", "Content": "I reserved this hotel through Hotwire and was worried after I found out the name of the hotel and read other guests' comments. However, once we got to the hotel and checked in, I can say that there was nothing to worry about. The size of the hotel room (#03) was certainly acceptable, and the decoration was recent and nice. We had necessary amenities in the room, including a flat-screen television, coffee/tea making necessities, a mini bar and a fully equipped bathroom. Of course, this hotel is in Paris, and the size of the room has to be judged accordingly. The \"down\" side was the hotel's distance from the nearest metro station (10 minute walk to \"Rome\"), but the stop for bus line 53 is a 2 minute walk. We did not try the 15 euro breakfast and chose to go to a brasserie nearby instead.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cHotwire Customers Beware - Not a 4 Star Hotel !\u201d", "Author": "FreqBizTraveller68", "ReviewID": "UR115400816", "Content": "I booked this hotel through Hotwire.

I have stayed at numerous hotels all over Paris and this is a good 3 star hotel AT BEST. If you are a Hotwire customer, they only give you the smallest rooms in the \"04\" series which face into a outdoor shaft meaning that the room is very dark.

BUT: The car park is some distance away in the basement of a seperate building, the spaces were tiny. if your car is any bigger than a Fiat 500 then you might have difficulty. to get in and out of this car park is another puzzle, you need to borrow a card from the Hotel, but you have to take this back there afterwards, there is nowhere to park outside the hotel so we caused trafic chaos whilst returning this card to the reception. The breakfast at 14 EUROS is poor, there a plenty of cafes nearby accross the railway bridge, I would reccoment going there for breakfast, as 14 EUR is a disgrace for a coffee and a croissant. The staff were very helpful and couldn't be faulted. the room was small but comfortable. the one amusing thing was that some previous guest had drunk all the spirits in the minibar and refilled the bottles with water. . . .
