{"Reviews": [{"Content": "6-Star Spa If you're looking for a superior class spa in Lovina, this is the place. The hotel is in the $30-$80 range, like a lot of others on Lovina Beach, but the spa is far better than most 5-star hotels. They can accommodate couples, or even larger groups. The staff are well-trained and friendly. And the selection of treatments includes a large variety, including packages if you have time available. We also ate lunch at the restaurant, which was a mixture of Balinese and Chinese - adequate and a good price. The hotel is renovating some rooms, so expect some construction noise. We didn't stay overnight, so I can't vouch for the rooms, but go here for a fantastic spa.", "Date": "Apr 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR533095496", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ObservantGuest"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297699-d1048931-r15156007-Banyualit_Spa_n_Resort-Singaraja_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1048931", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
