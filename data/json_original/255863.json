Hotel Stellar was on my list of 'available' hotels and it's combination of great location, very nice room and pleasant staff means we'll look to stay here when we're paying for a visit to Sydney, not on the company tab. The corporate price I paid was a bargain. From the outside it doesn't look like much and the tiny enclosed reception desk gives no indication of the standard of the rooms. I believe I'm actually in a deluxe so my my review is based on this room but it is a perfect city base, with one exception - the tv. Our last Sydney hotel had a similar issue - wrong aspect being broadcast to the rooms. Television has been broadcast in Australia in widescreen for many years now. When will hotels stop treating their customers like chumps and provide in room tvs with the correct aspect. I'm watching Sky news at the moment and the reporters are all short and fat and half of the information on the screen is off the edges. Can it really be that hard? Back to the room though. Looks like it was renovated last week. Very modern. Comfy bed, kitchenette with microwave, jug, toaster, fridge etc. Sofa, lots of cupboard space, big bathroom with decent products. Decent priced minibar. Silly chair at the desk though. It needs to be higher or the desk lower. The hotel offers a buffet continental breakfast in the 'underground' bar or you can get a cooked brekkie in the cafe that leads off the hotel lobby. Oddly you can't charge back from there. They also offer room service for dinner/late night (that I didn't try) and the bar in the lobby (staffed by the hotel receptionist as required) offers a two for one happy hour each evening from 5pm to 6pm.

Let me up front give the positives: - Location next to Hyde Park is fantastic, and its a short walk down to the train station to get to the airport. Much more economical than a cab. The amazing Longrain Thai restaurant is just down the street as well. - The rooms are pretty spacious and the bed was comfortable. Noticed a mouse trap next to the fridge but didn't see any problems. I didn't encounter any of the noise problems others have complained about here. - There's a small coffee shop in the lobby. While it isn't open a lot of the time, the coffee is good and its nice to be able to get one right there (though the Starbucks across Hyde Park offers a good view of the park). Now the negatives. - Front Desk: I should have known something would go wrong when my wife and I arrived at 7am fresh from a 22 hour trek from New York to Sydney, and we were made to wait for a good 15 minutes while the girl behind the front desk argued with the guy checking out. Obviously she has to attend to that customer, but we weren't even acknowledged. After he left, we were told it would be 1 hour before we could check-in since housekeeping was cleaning the room right then. We walked across Hyde Park to Starbucks and waited. When we came back, the girl said the room was ready but that she had to go upstairs to check first before we could check in. we went to sit in the lounge... and waited and waited. I came back 30 minutes later, and it emerged she had forgotten about us even though she had nothing to do. My wife had to flag another staff member, who went upstairs and we were finally allowed to check in. On departure, we had no problems, but opted to store our luggage in the small closet in the lobby. When we returned to the hotel, they simply gave us the key and told us to fetch the luggage ourselves. That's fine - we werent staying in the Four Seasons - but at the same time I'm not sure I'd leave my luggage there again if they simply give the key to anyone and they can take what they want. - Internet: Off the lobby there are several computers for internet surfing. I forget the rates, but they were reasonable. The computers on the other hand are about as old as the country of Australia itself. It would take literally 5 minutes for any webpage to load. We bought 30 minutes of internet time in order to book some hotels for our trip to New Zealand, and we hardly were able to visit more than two sites. - Elevator: Its as bad as advertised.

You can take the train from the airport straight to Museum Station and walk for about 5 minutes to the hotel. Breakfast was good, altough the \"Green Lounge\" is outdated. I think that the big problem with this hotel is the uncompleted renovation. For example: they placed new windows in the rooms, but kept the old curtain rails. Because of this the curtains hit the windows and the curtain rails were loose. This looks shabby. There is also a very old elevator in the hotel that makes a lot of noise that you can hear in your room. The room was big enough and clean. Our first impression was not very good. An employee had promised us a room via e-mail on the highest floor. This was impossible according to the reception. Luckily I saved a printout of the mail so I was able to prove it. But anyhow, the room was gone so we had to stay on a lower floor. When we entered the room the auto-closing system was broken so the door was stuck halfway. The door of the bathroom was also very stuck. I reported this to the reception and they promised to tell the maintenance man. Next day I met the maintenance man in the corridor and asked him about it. He said they didn't report it and the maintenance book was empty. But he would fix it right away and he did like promised. On the last day we had to go to the airport very early. The girl from the breakfast \"lounge\" made a wonderful breakfast basket. So thumbs up for some of the staff and thumbs down for reception.

In the lobby area was a number of internet PCs available for a small daily fee, as well as a sitting area with couches, TV, books and magazines etc. The staff were fantastic and quick to assist with any request. On our anniversary night it was pouring with rain and the taxi we had called for to take us to the theatre had not arrived. Without hestitaiton the receptionist grabbed an umbrella and went out into the rain to the main cross road and brought back a taxi. Unknown to us, our daughter had contacted the hotel and asked for champagne and Swiss chocolates to be delivered to our room on our anniversary, which they arranged for a delightful surprise. We found the hotel was a reasonable walk from many of the places we wanted to visit in the central part of Sydney, and close to the train for everywhere else. In fact, we arrived and left on the train from the nearby Museum station. We didn't have any qualms walking around at night, admittedly this was mid-week so perhaps the clubbers were at home. Again perhaps due to being mid-week, the night club in the hotel posed no problems for us. One of us is a VERY light sleeper, and had no issues with noise. The only thing that did disappoint was the paucity of room service meals. Due to the rain we decided to stay in for dinner one evening and could not get a meal delivered so we tried room service. Unfortunately they did not have an in-house kitchen so our choices were a lavash wrap sandwich or a microwaved lasagne. The evening receptionist was very apologetic and said this situation was being reviewed so it may have changed by now. We felt the Stellar was indeed stellar and would have no hesitation in staying there should we visit Sydney again.", "Date": "November 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cGreat deal\u201d", "Author": "marshymellow", "ReviewID": "UR20015888", "Content": "Fantastic rooms, great location, very helpful staff and overall a great deal for rooms in the Sydney CBD.", "Date": "September 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cNot too bad\u201d", "Author": "oldpuggler", "ReviewID": "UR19562422", "Content": "We booked a two night stay over the weekend at Hotel Stellar.

We stayed ther 5 nights, and the one helpful girl finally gave us a map of Sydney and told us where the nearest train staion was after we were there a couple of days. I went across the street to the Y Hotel to ask their staff for information, use the internet, etc. Would have stayed there instead had they not been booked. Still, the Hotel Stellar rooms are nice.", "Date": "September 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value, good design\u201d", "Author": "gayChicagotrvlr", "ReviewID": "UR5616357", "Content": "My partner and I stayed at the Hotel Stellar for a week in late July, visiting from Chicago. It has great value (we booked on the web and had a rate half the price of similar hotels in Sydney), features large spacious rooms with minimalist, modern design and lighting, is exceptionally clearn, and a good location. (You might do better location-wise as a tourist staying nearer Circular Quay, which is nevertheless an easy subway, bus, or 20-25-minute walk through beatiful Hyde Park. Location would be excellent for business travellers on a budget, and perfect for gay and lesbian Mardi Gras, right at the beginning of Oxford Street. Museum subway stop is 1.5 blocks away; Central a quick cab ride.) The hotel staff is competent and friendly. There's no concierge and they don't have a terrific amount of info on Sydney; the lobby is basically ambience-free, but it's tremendous value for the price anyway. Our room had a kitchenette, and there's a coin laundry. Looks like the hotel caters mostly to tourists -- all ages, lots of nationalities (Germans, Americans, Canadians, Brits, Australians, New Zealanders...), gay and straight, families, groups of friends. Two very minor surprises: little flexibility on check-out time (but they happily stow luggage) and the in-room safes are a small, added daily fee. Well above average, and highly recommended if you're not looking for high-end frills.", "Date": "August 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Victoria, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat All-rounder!\u201d", "Author": "Europeanhoneymoon", "ReviewID": "UR4460979", "Content": "Reasonably quiet, close to everything especially transport, very friendly staff; especially the cleaners and the maintenance man (ask him for directions, he's awesome!).
