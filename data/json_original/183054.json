The airport bus drops/picks up right at the front, costs about \u20ac26 euro return. The outside of the hotel is not that attractive, but on entering the lobby it is clean bright and welcoming. The rooms were great, we booked one with a double and 2 twins which was quite spacious, and the price for such a central hotel was very reasonable. Nice views from the upper floors, it is an 18 floor hotel with 2 lifts. There is not that many rooms on each floor so isn't much traffic passing your door, and had no trouble with noise from other rooms. The rooms were cleaned every day, with fresh towels and the beds were very comfortable. There is free internet usage in the lobby, two computers for use by clients. Only thing that annoyed us, was that the staff did not bother to inform us of the availability of breakfast downstairs, or about the 2nd floor gym. Instead we had to locate breakfast in various cafes in the area each morning. I assumed when it was not mentioned to us, that it was not available, but I see recent reviewers have mentioned it. This would have saved us a bit of hassle trying to find nice places to eat! Other than that this is a brilliant hotel. Based on other negative reviewers I was a little dubious about booking as we stayed for 5 nights. But I am delighted to say this hotel was in a fantastic location, very clean and comfortable, and was a contributing factor to ensuring that our visit to Toronto was amazing!

You'll need your room card for elevator, except to get down to Lobby level. What I liked: - good price - downtown location, convenient to shopping, subway, theatres - remodelled rooms, white bedding - well designed bathroom with newish tub - sheers and blackout drapes on wall to wall window, with a window that opens - mini fridge, something I wasn't expecting - iron and board, coffeemaker, hairdryer - ice and drink machines on every 3 floors - noon checkout, even though back of door indicates 11am - 2nd floor gym was better than I was expecting, although closes at 10pm. LifeFitness equipment includes eliptical, bike, 2 treadmills, a multifunction. Also, there were mats, an exercise ball, free weights, a washroom, water cooler, flat panel wall TVs, handtowels Didn't like - room is very compact; mine had two twin beds. - heat/air conditioner immediately next to the one bed - narrow shelf desk with cheap chair - the 'make room up' on the back of 'do not disturb' signs. I had housekeeping knocking, likely because someone passing by chose to flip it around - flat panel TV takes a while to switch between stations - sliding bathroom door rattled terribly; bathroom lights really slow to come on; cheap towels - the only free internet is if you use one of the 2 computers in the extended lobby - no plastic bag to line the room ice bucket - no swimming pool/hot tub/sauna - closed restaurant; although there's continental in the basement until 9:30am.

The AC kept turning on and off randomly for 1-2 mins every 45mins or so. Even when i set the AC unit and the thermal stat unit to \"OFF\" mode. Dropping the \"SET\" temperature did not help either. Another problem was how thin the wall was. You could hear everything that goes on outside your room. That includes people talking in the hallway and opening and closing their room doors. There is no pressure spring for the hotel door so the door will slam hard every time somebody enter a room. The bathroom is a sliding door with no lock so if you have friends traveling with you; you would want to let them know. Turning on the shower head with hot water set all the way will stop it from working. You had to turn on the shower head with cold water and slowly adjust it to hot. kind of annoying but nothing serious. These was problems located in my room. your stay could be different.

Our TV came on at volume 29 and the remotes did not work very well. We even had them replace them, both were taped together. So if you didn't think to check on the TV itself to turn the volumne down or change channels it remained high. Bistro - DELUXE breakfast included, not what you think.. orange juice, bagel, coffee or tea. You could get cheese and something else on the bagel. I had mine toasted with butter and this was very good. Bistro only open 7am until 2 in the afternoon so no onsite restaurant for dinner or later and no room service.

Although small as mentioned in many other reviews, they were Clean and overall smartly designed. we had two single beds and there was a coffeemaker. The bathroom 'door' was my least favourite feature as it 'slides' along the outside of the opening. Needless to say, it does not provide full privacy whilst in the bathroom as it does not full cover the door opening. Wasn't a huge deal to us, but word of advice may be to bring along some air freshener and prepare to do some 'courtesy flushing'. Location cannot be beat for the price.

Unfortunately, some of its cool looks impair basic function, which prevents me from recommending it to anyone who isn't traveling alone. Most of the problems are connected to the bathroom. First of all, there is no curtain or door to enclose the shower - instead, a solid glass wall blocks off the half of the shower closest to the faucet. There are two problems with this. First, you will inevitably splatter a lot of water onto the bathroom floor. Second, if you happen to turn on the shower at too high of a temperature, there will be no way for you to turn it off without scalding yourself. (We didn't do this, but I imagine other people have.) The other problem was the door to the bathroom - a semi-opaque glass sliding door that is offset from the bathroom wall by a couple of inches. This means, first, that you can see into the shower from the room. I suppose that might be titillating if you're traveling with the right person, but if you're with a child or friend it might just be awkward. Secondly, the door does absolutely nothing to muffle noises coming from the bathroom - and that's awkward for just about anybody. A couple more warnings - this hotel has rooms with two single beds. Beware of that when booking through services that allow you to name your own price - we ended up paying $15 per night to upgrade to a queen size bed. The hotel website also mentions a \"nominal\" charge for internet access - $40 per week is the cost (proportionally more if you pay by the day). And it isn't very fast, at least in our room - my Flickr uploads kept timing out. So, that's the bad. The good - well, it's clean and modern, as I said. The staff was friendly.

I'll start off with the good. The location couldn't be any better. You are a 3 minute walk from the doors of the Eaton Centre, minutes from the Subway and street cars, and only a $12 dollar cab ride from downtown attractions like the CN Tower and Air Canada Centre. The room was small, but *mostly* clean (more on that later). Our plane got in around 12, so we checked in early with no problems and the people at the front desk seemed pleasant. You need to insert your room key to use the elevator which is a nice safety feature. The room was nicely renovated and the bed was comfortable and surprisingly enough, we had no problem sleeping at night because there was no noise coming from Dundas square. The bad: The lobby stinks like burnt coffee at all times, the restaurant/cafe thing that is in the lobby is overpriced for the quality of the food. The ugly: This made me cringe. We brought our suitcases up to our room and left them there as we went to explore Kensington market (which is a 5 minute ride away) and came back to have a nap before dinner. I pulled down the sheets and what did I find? Yellow stains in multiple spots all over my side of the bed. Disgusting. My fiance went to go downstairs to complain and there was a cleaning lady in the hallway so he just got a new sheet from her and told her what was wrong. She apologized and offered to put the sheet on for us but we just did it ourselves. The hotel needs a pool, that is the only improvement I would suggest. It is a great stay for the price and the location can't be beat. I would stay here again for sure, I would just make sure the sheets were clean before I got into bed.

Our first stay was ok. The room was outdated, and the hallways stunk horribly but other than that, I had no complaints. Our second stay was a complete nightmare. Our daughter had an MRI scheduled for 7 30 am the next day, so we had to wake up at 6 am. The night before, we asked for extra towels, soap and shampoo so we could bathe our daughter, and then shower ourselves. 20 minutes later, a service man smelling like motor oil came to our door and shoved at me a tiny bottle of shampoo. I explained that we had ordered three shampoos, three soaps and three extra towels. He was running away from our door and into the elevator before I finished the word shampoo. We waited for an hour and a half, and guess what? No one came too bring towels or soap, or other shampoos. (Not saying that I would have used towels that someone obviously covered in some sort of oil anyways) Also, to top it off, our telephone in the room did not work so we had to go downstairs to ask for the extras to begin with. So 7 30pm rolls in, and our daughter hasn't eaten dinner, and no one has returned with towels, or to fix the phone, so we go down again to the front desk. I told them we were stepping outside so my partner and I could have a cigarette, and would prefer if they didn't send anyone in our room while we were not in it (as we have expensive jewelery in our bags) When we got back to our room, two towels were placed on our bathroom sink... with black smears on them. Luckily, none of our personal items were taken that I can think of. However it is now pushing 8 pm, and we still have not been able to go out and get dinner since we were waiting on towels to begin with... and we can't order food as the phone does not work. A few minutes later, another \"service worker\" brought us a new phone... we tried to order a pizza to the room, but the phone died in the middle of our order. We then take our daughter in her pajamas, go to the front desk to tell them how incompetent this hotel is, and have to walk down Young st to grab a slice of pizza for dinner, it is now pushing 9 pm in the evening! Needless to say, it was 10 30 before we were back at the hotel, done eating and washing up, and in bed. And our daughter had to wait till 9pm to eat. Now, here's the real kicker. I cannot sleep cause I am constantly itching in bed! Feels like little bugs all over my body. Found the telltale signs of bedbugs (little black dried blood balls) in the sheets. Also found a spider near my daughters bed the next morning. After the MRI we go to catch the elevator to check out. And a housekeeper immediately presses the \"door close\" button when the elevator opened on our front door right in my 9 year old daughters face! We check out and the young lady at the front desk informs us that we have four telephone calls that we have to pay for! After trying to explain that the phone did not work, she just kept repeating that we would have to pay. I asked to speak to the manager. I told him this exact story. He covered the $1.46 phone charges, and nothing else. Horrible customer service! That night should have been free considering the hardships. I would much rather sleep on a urine covered cardboard box than stay at the Bond Place again. At least the homeless people will have better manners, and I would have saved $180.

The room does have A/C however the unit is on the floor directly next to one of the beds so unless you want to wake up with icicles forming on your nose you cant sleep with it on- real shame due to the heat. The room was on the small side as I believe everyone else has mentioned howerver you have to bear in mind you are slap bang in the centre of a city so we had no problems with the room or the amminties in it- A/C, large flat screen TV, coffee making unit, and clean towels every day. The maid service was very good; the room on our return at the end of the day was cleaned, beds made and bathroom cleaned and bins emptied. We had no view of Dundas Sq and did ring down to reception to ask for a change of room however the hotel was fully booked until the last 3 nights. The hotel where more than happy to move us then- we decided that as we where only in the room for a short period of time the view was not that important. There is no 'eatery' as such in the hotel but there is a nice coffee lounge and of course you are only meters away from the Eaton Centre with its numerous fast food units and the PATH system that is a labyrinth of shops and food courts. Eating out can be expensive plus when you are on a 'budget' you have to factor in the tax being added on to the ticket price. We like many others found the food court in Dundas & Younge subway station a real life saver- there is a fab bagel shop on the lower floor that do cheap bagels and tea/coffee for about $4-5 each. Would recommend 'Eggspection' on Younge Street for lunch/brunch, 'The SenatorDiner'- Victoria Street(a lovely old fashioned diner with booths) just around the corner from the hotel for a good fried breakfast, and for a really cheap and delicious dinner head back to Younge street to Paramount restaurant (authentic Lebanese food and bakery) or The Asian Bowl' - super for price and quality of food! There is loads to do and see while in Toronto. The yellow tour bus is good value as the ticket runs for a week so we used it as our means to get around town. It included a boat cruise around the Toronto Islands (which you have to go over and visit and only $6 return). The CN Tower of course is a must and the museum of Ontario (ROM) is really good also. WE really enjoyed our trip to Toronto and would definitely return to The Bond Place Hotel as we thought the location was fab- slap bang in the middle of a bustling friendly, safe city. Enjoy your trip, am sure you will!", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saginaw, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cNice rooms, everything else bad...\u201d", "Author": "DUtrainertom", "ReviewID": "UR115056668", "Content": "The hotel was arranged for a large wedding that I was attending, and thus I was able to get others experiences as well. The hotel was finishing its' major renovations. The front of the building had no sign, and literally had vinyl sheeting peeling off of the front. It looks like subsidized housing. I drove by the hotel multiple times over an hour trying to find the place, always wary of going into the building that ended up being the hotel. The management really needs to put at least a temporary sign on the front until construction is done; having your clients drive around for an hour trying to find the place does not make for a return visit. The rooms are nicely appointed, however there are no towel racks at all. Your towels have to sit on the toilet while you shower. The parking garage is across the street, and underneath a rather decrepit building. It is very tight, but is at least very well secured. Unfortunately, the garage does not take credit cards, but is cash only. They do not tell you this until you are leaving the garage. Luckily you can put the parking charges on your hotel bill, but only if you re-park your car and go back into the hotel and ask for a voucher. It costs $15 CDN per day, with unlimited in-out privelages. Now we get to the really bad. The staff is horrible. They either do not care, or are not interested in helping you. Regardless, rather than finding solutions to simple problems, they are condescending. I simply will not stay at this hotel again soley based on the staff. There are many other chain hotels near by the location that are similarly priced and I know do not have this problem. Botique hotels such as this have to cut a niche in order to make it. Unfortunately, this hotels niche is in a polished interior with a rotten exterior and rotten staff.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta GA", "Title": "\u201cComfortable, Attractive, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "KimberlyAtlantaGA", "ReviewID": "UR114885097", "Content": "Many other reviewers have complained that the rooms are small. It is true they are small, but they are cleverly designed so that they are comfortable and have everything you need. I was very happy with the room and recommend staying at this hotel. We stayed in a twin room on the 5th floor for three days. We found the room attractive, clean, and easy to use. There was a coffee kit (we didn't use it), a small fridge (we used it every day), a small standing wardrobe, and a folding luggage stand. There was no dresser, but we didn't miss it. The desk was a built-in shelf that ran the width of the room under the windows, and was convenient for our laptop and as an extended night table. The floors are laminate, which I expected to be noisy, but they weren't. The windows ran the width of the room, letting in lots of light, and had both sheers and block-out drapes. The AC unit was new, with a digital thermostat on the wall. The bed linens were new and comfortable, though the mattresses are quite hard. There were several electrical outlets around the room, giving us plenty of options for charging our gadgets. I hate paying for Internet at a hotel, but we did buy 48 hours of service at the Bond. It was easy to connect to and we could use it on multiple devices at once, so I can't complain. For those who only want a quick check of email or maps, there are a couple computers in the lobby to use. The bathroom was also small, but newly refurbished and stylish. Because of the narrow vanity space, they built a shelf/cabinet at one side of the sink, which offered a lot more space. The shower had good water pressure and plenty of hot water. The toilet flushed very loudly. The fan failed to remove any steam from the air. The door was a sliding door, which was excellent for making the small space more useable, but as others have commented, this allowed more bathroom noise to be heard in the room. It didn't bother us, and I didn't find the bathroom noise any worse than any other hotel I've been in. The towels were a little rough and they were stingy with the supply: one washcloth, one hand towel, and two bath towels per day. We were supplied with small bar soaps, shampoo and hand cream, which were good quality and pleasantly scented. Housekeeping honored our Do Not Disturb card, but still serviced the room every day even though we didn't leave til noon each day. Besides making the beds and cleaning the bath, our things were straightened up and our luggage was not disturbed. Street noise was an issue for me, though it didn't bother my husband. Yonge-Dundas Square is only a block away, and the bars and restaurants around it are open until 11pm. The pubs serve until 2am, including the Imperial just across the street. Traffic noises--trucks and street cars--continued until about midnight, and drunken revelers laughed and sang til well after 2am. It was not that bad, though, and simple ear plugs would have solved the problem. I usually travel with some, but forgot them this time. The neighborhood is typically urban. Yonge-Dundas Square and its surrounding shops a block away are bright and new. We ate in the YD food court most mornings and caught the subway there, too. Neighboring streets are a little shabbier, but I never felt unsafe or afraid. We went to a convenience store most nights around 11 or 12 to buy sodas and had no troubles, other than the ubiquitous panhandlers. I wasn't impressed with the front desk staff, but they were adequate. Our first night we arrived after 11pm, and we were starving. The front desk directed us to the late-night Subway or Pizza Pizza shops nearby. We had Pizza Pizza, which was very disappointing. I wish we'd been told there were two all-night breakfast diners nearby. They would have been much better choices. On our second day we asked for more towels and pillows in our room as we left for the day. We never got them. On our last day we asked them to hold our luggage several hours until we caught the airport shuttle in the afternoon. They did so happily, giving us a claim check. The hotel has a little cafe/coffeeshop in the lobby that we didn't try. After visiting the food court, I can say the cafe's prices were decent. The hallways are a little dim and claustrophobic. I could see they had been updated to the new d\u00c3\u00a9cor, but the carpets on our floor were already stained and dirty. The room doors had been painted, but were obviously old. The insides of the rooms are much nicer than the hallways make you expect. Overall, very pleased. The price was a bit high for my budget, but was very good for the heart of downtown. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find anything else even close to the same price in that neighborhood that was anywhere near the same quality. You can certainly stay cheaper in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcburbs or near the airport, but for downtown, it was great.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cGood experience, good location.

We ended up on 17 and had lovely city views and a totally acceptable noise level. Yes, the rooms are a little small, but that didn't bother any of us. After all, you're in the middle of a city. They're clean, modern, interestingly designed, have cool lighting, and still offer classic amenities like a fridge, coffee maker, hair dryer, flat-screen TV, etc. I appreciated the wood floors, as carpet always seems so dirty. Another reviewer said this hotel is in a bad area. This is not at all true. Not only is it close to streetcars and the Dundas subway stop, the neighborhood is actually very touristy with a lot of activity. It's close to Eaton Centre, the Financial District, a big H&M, an AMC movie theatre, etc. Wireless isn't free, but the espresso bar in the lobby turned out great coffee. One minor complaint is that there is nowhere to hang towels. Not even one hook, and the showers don't have shower curtain rods, so you can't drape them over that, either. Seems a strange oversight for bathroom design. Certainly not a reason to avoid this hotel, more a note to management in case they happen to be reading! We got a great deal using the early bird online special, which gave us a lower rate but you pay immediately and it's totally non-refundable, which was no problem in our case.

The hotel is located on Dundas Square (Toronto's mini-Times Square), which is within walking distance of all the major attractions. Dundas Square subway station is almost just across the street, as is the bus station. There are also tramway lines stopping nearby. My room was spotlessly clean, on the 16th floor, with great views of the city skyline. The hotel is undergoing an extensive refurbishment, but I didn't hear any noise. My floor (and room) had been completely renovated and the room had a clean, modern look. The walk-in glass shower was great, and I generally had an excellent, comfortable stay. Lots of TV channels to choose from, as well as a large selection of movies (for a fee). The staff were friendly and helpful. My only concern was the lack of free wifi, which would be a plus. At the moment you have to pay 8$ for a 24-hour access period. I'd be happy paying a nominal fee (like 2-3$ per day), but 8$ is a bit steep.

I called down and was told again they would send someone to stop the work. One hour later, at 10 am, the noise starts again. That was the end of it. I asked for the duty manager, and was told I could come down to the lobby to see her (not even able to come to the room!). I got dressed, went to the lobby, and proceeded to see if there was another room available, or any way to fix the problem. there were no other rooms, and I was promised the work would not continue, however, my colleague was in the room while I was in the lobby, and she told me the noise had resumed. I then proceeded to ask for a refund, as my night's sleep was ruined. the manager said she could not. When asked if it was because she did not have that authority, she would not answer. I was booked for a second night there, but cancelled and booked a room at the delta chelsea instead. It was only once I had booked the other hotel that all of a sudden they had other rooms, and tried to offer me another room. Too little, too late. It was a saturday, and the general manager was not there, so after much protest on my part, I paid, and got the manager's name and number. I called the manager 3 times in the week after that, also left numerous messages with the director of sales, and have not got a call back yet. Totally unacceptable way to run a hotel. I understand there might be work to do, but telling customners the noise will stop, only to have it start again 3 more times, is misleading and dishonest. not to mention there was no indication before hand that there was work being done there. When I asked if there would be no work on the sunday morning, they said \"I dont think so\"... not very reassuring. the manager on saturday was of no help to me, no effort to make things right, just a blank stare back at my protesting. I really dont think I should have had to pay for a night (I work late, and the point of getting a hotel is to get a good night's sleep) that was interupted 3 times, and that I was flat out lied to.

We typically use Priceline to book our hotels, and The Bond Place was the \"winner\" this year. The hotel's location is very close to Eaton Center and Dundas Square, which is great, but the neighborhood borders on questionable, especially after dark. Contrary to other reviews, the hotel is not located directly in Dundas Square; rather it is about a block away, near the corner of Dundas and Victoria. It is exceptionally close to the TTC Dundas subway station and streetcars, which is great. If you're into going out at night to any clubs on Adelaide, a $10 cab ride is necessary to get back to the hotel late at night. We checked in around 3 p.m. and got right into our room. We had single beds in a tiny room, but it was clean and the beds were comfortable. The flat-screen television on the wall was a nice touch and there was adequate drawer space and hangers for clothes and other belongings. The \"concierge\" at the hotel seemed little more than a tour salesperson. Throughout our stay, she tried to sell us tours to Niagara and other places around the area. If I need information, I prefer to ask for it, not be heckled with it. The hotel charges $10 for internet access. That alone is the reason I didn't give the hotel a higher rating. In this day and age, there is no excuse for any hotel to charge for internet access. When low-end hotels offer it as a free amenity, it is worth noting and rebuking hotels that continue to charge for access to the web. Parking is $15 a day, in an underground, secured parking ramp. You must prepay with cash in order to park in the hotel's parking area. The hotel lobby has a great coffee bar that offers breakfast sandwiches and good coffee at a reasonable price. Overall, we had a nice stay at The Bond Place.

Right next to you is a Hard Rock Cafe (many tasty meals were eaten here) the Toronto Eaton Centre (A HUGE shopping mall that runs under the city, to save you walking in the elements in the Winter season) and the subway! You are also very close to the historical district, which has some of the oldest Cathedrals in Toronto. The hotels lobby was under construction during our stay, but we didn't really know any of it was happening, as they only worked during hours while we were out. The staff were very helpful and they even have a tourist service which can book trips to Niagra Falls for you, which my boyfriend and I gladly took the opportunity of going on! The room was very clean, not terribly spacious, but enough room for the amount of time we were staying there. I enjoyed the fact they had wooden flooring, which were always sparkling! They even had extra pillows, incase you needed them, the beds were very comfortable. There isn't much in the ways of a restaurant/breakfast bar in the lobby, but that didn't bother us as we easily sorted out renting a fridge ($10 per night) to store milk and bought our own breakfast from the many convenience stores around.

I arrived at the hotel at about 8pm on a Saturday night, after catching the Airport Express coach from Pearson, which stops right outside the door. Very convenient and, at $32.95 return, cheaper than a taxi. Check in was quick, thankfully, after a long flight from London, and I was given a room on the 8th floor overlooking Dundas Street. The room was a good size for me, with twin beds, a desk, two chairs, a coffee machine (which I did not try, as I'm a coffee snob!) and a full sized ironing board and iron. The rooms have recently been renovated with hard wood floors and big flat screen TV's. The bathrooms don't appear to have been touched and, whilst clean, are a little on the dated side. Not luxury by any means but a great base for exploring this wonderful city. The hotel is literally steps away from Yonge/Dundas Square (I could see the North East corner from my room) and no more than a 3 minute walk across the Square to the Eaton Centre, with plenty of shops and a couple of food courts. There is also an AMC cinema in the Square, in a complex that includes more shops and food options. On the Saturday and Sunday nights, the (free) NXNE festival was happening in Yonge/Dundas Square (I believe Iggy Pop and De La Soul were headlining on respective nights) and the music was LOUD. This is in no way the fault of the hotel, however. This is a fairly busy area (Toronto's equivalent of Times Square, only not as tacky) therefore there is a lot of street noise at times but this did not bother me, as it is part and parcel of city vacations. Some people have mentioned that the beds are uncomfortable. I would describe them as being a little like a pin cushion - very hard base with little padding on top. I did wake up with back ache a couple of times, however, I would much prefer this bed than a soft mattress with no support whatsoever. My room was on the whole really clean, however, I did drop a pair of black shorts on the floor and they were a little bit dusty when I picked them up. I would have liked a full length mirror - there are waist-level ones in the bathroom and above the drawer unit, but a girl needs a head-to-toe view! There was also no towel rail in my bathroom (but marks where one had been) so I had to hang my wet towels over the clothes rail. An in-room safe would have been useful too. I didn't hear much noise from other guests, other than the odd toilet flush or shower. The maid tried to service my room one morning at 8.30 but as I had locked the door, she couldn't get in and came back later. The Hop On/Hop Off buses stop at Yonge/Dundas and there are bus, streetcar (tram) and metro/tube stops in or around the Square. It is about a 15-20 minute walk down Yonge St to the harbour front and attractions such as the CN Tower. As a woman travelling alone, I felt perfectly safe in Toronto, and at this hotel. I loved my trip to Toronto and recommend a side visit to Niagara Falls - truly stunning!

The hotel is in a fab location right on Dundas Square and straight across the road from the Eaton Centre and Dundas subway station. The airport express bus stops directly outside the door. They are currently renovating the hotel so some of the foyer and restaurant are closed. The rooms are clean and newly decorated with a huge flatscreen tv, comfy beds and wooden floors. They are of average size, not huge but not tiny. The bathroom is disappointing as the tiles are stained and the grout looks grubby. They really need to renovate the bathrooms in line with the new rooms. It is cleaned thoroughly daily. There is wireless internet available at 8.95 for 24 hours which is not expensive compared to other hotels I've stayed in. It is important to remember this is a BUDGET hotel and bearing that in mind I think it is great value for the location and service.

After that mess, when we entered the room, we saw why they would have made us purchase another room; this room was very cramped. Our luggage would not even fit through the space between the far wall and the uneven and uncomfortable single beds. The room was also without any sort of refrigeration unit, which you would expect from a supposed 3-4 star hotel. The hair dryer was also broken, though the staff insured that it wasn't. I also like my things how I leave them, so when I did not wish for the staff to organize and clean the room, they became very nosy and suspicious, to the point where when I requested more towels, the manager himself attempted to convince me to let them come in and clean right then. I was not impressed. The walls are also paper thin, and all night I could only hear a man and a woman arguing in some Asian dialect.

We had a been on a 3 week trip of the USA and had booked a leg in Canada. Our travel agent organised the room at Bond Place Hotel. We arrived to the hotel at check in time and our room was not ready. The \"robotic\" staff behind the counter told us to take a seat in the lobby - only problem was there were no seats as a youth group of around 40 or so people were hanging around there also. It's fine that we had to wait - what's not fine is that rather than the desk clerks looking after us and checking back with us on the status of our room, we seemed to be forgotten and only the nice gentleman who took up the bag who kept checking back with us and asked us why we were still sitting there - I believe it was actaully him that got us our room otherwise we probably would have been sitting there all night. My travel agent had pre ordered me a Mini bar fridge for medical purposes (my life threatening medication needs to be kept in a refridgerator at all times when not in use). I then double checked with my travel agent in regards to this and she assured me a request had been made (as was on my paperwork also). When we checked in finally I reminded the receptionist of the fridge and she said it would be sent up right away. Once we got to our room (which I found to be neat and nicely newly renovated - nice big tv, hard wood floors, comfy beds and a fabulous heating system - bathroom was satisfactory but could do with a makeover also), we fell asleep due to being on an overnight flight. I thought I'd be awoken to the person bringing up the fridge but I was not - I then rang front desk and was informed quite bluntly that there were now no fridges available as a client had extended their hire. I proceeded to tell reception that I was a diabetic and my insulin had to be kept in the fridge at all times - and of course that I had pre ordered and confirmed the fridge prior to (not to mention at check in was told it was availible). I believe under the circumstances they should have tried to rectify the situation - it wasn't for alcoholic beveradges or snacks after all. I was then told they could bring me up a bucket of ice. If this was the best they could do, I would have to accept it. An hour passed and no one came up - by this stage I was quite irate. I'm not the type of person to ring up and abuse or demand at hotels - but this was the final straw. When I rang to ask where the bucket of ice was I was told rudely that I could go get it myself from another floor!! If I had known I could get it all along I would have - well after all this I went to get it myself and low and behold the ice machine didnt work! Luckily I ran into a more helpful staff member there and he brought a bucket up to my room. It seemed the service staff (except reception) were the helpful people in the place. This may seem like a stupid situation for some people - but when my health could possibly be affected by poor service from a hotel - I was genuinely distressed and upset. This situation tarnished what could have been a pleasant stay at this hotel.

This was the worst experience that I have ever had with a hotel in Toronto. The staff was rude. Our washroom was nasty. We didn't get the room we booked.

All thanks, of course, the the centrality and convenience our hotel. We stayed at the Bond Place hotel, and certainly were not disappointed! We were extremely nervous about staying downtown, but there was 24-security in the reception area, which made 2 solo girls feel very safe in and around the building. Sure, on first impression it felt like the neighborhood was rather shady, but the opposite is true. The room was IMMACULATE; extremely clean, pristine sheets, newly renovated flooring and storage space, and a beautiful view of downtown. We did not try the in-house restaurant, but walked instead to the Toronto Eaton Centre, which hosts a food court. There is also the Hard Rock Cafe, Milestones, Jack Astor's, etc. right nearby. Also within short walking distance is a gas station, several convenience stores and a delivery pizza place (can't remember what it was called). If you are looking for a large, luxurious room with all the amenities (such as a pool or fitness centre), perhaps the Bond is not for you. Besides, in downtown Toronto, why would you want to spend your time in the pool when there's so much else to do right next door? If all you need is a comfortable, safe place to sleep for less that $100 per night in downtown Toronto, you cannot go wrong! The rooms are quiet, despite the contrary when you are out in the halls. The front desk is open 24-hours, but if you reserve online they like you to let them know if you'll be checking in late, if you require a refrigerator, etc. Very close to TTC (Toronto's Subway system), and of course, easy to catch a cab.

I was quoted the rate of $117/night. I requested for a 3-bedded room on a high floor and asked for a confirmation by email, but received none. It was touted to have a good location at the junction of Yonge and Dundas Streets, with easy access to many attractions of Toronto. Not mentioned was that the hotel is located on the street junction of Yonge and Dundas East (where the seediness begins). The hotel is far from the Promenade of Lake Ontario, CN Towers, Rogers Centre and Entertainment District. Checked into the hotel late 28th August after a tiring flight from Vancouver. Felt immediately that it was a wrong choice. The Front Desk personnel quoted the rate of $159/night and retained my Visa Card. I objected the rate and asked if we could stay only for 1 night. Was told that I'd still have to pay for all 4 nights. Was given a 3-single bedded room on the 5th floor. I requested again for a higher room. The lady at the Front Desk appeared irritated and told me none were to be had. I asked for my card, but she said she had to make a copy of it. The very small room was not carpeted, the large aircon by one of the beds took up precious space, the table lamp wasn't working and the TV remote control wasn't working properly and jumped channels on its own. Both windows of the room faced a building construction site reaching up to the 8th storey and was so near that the workers could easily look into the room. As I had 2 teenage daughters with me, we'd to close the windows and draw the curtains owing to the noise and visibility. The bathroom was passable although the wall had mould stains. With our luggages on the floor, there was barely enough space to trip around. As we were very tired, we decided to take the room and make the best of it. The noise from garbage trucks woke us every morning at about 4.30am. Followed by the traffic and from Monday, the construction work. We spent as much time as possible out of the hotel and paid for all our undertakings with cash. So I did not miss my Visa card. Each evening when we had to return, I'd knots in my guts just thinking of the room which felt like an isolation cell. After sleepless nights to Tuesday morning, I decided not to stick it out anymore and complained to the Day Manager. He apologised and said that they had a couple of rooms on each floor with 3-single beds! He offered us a another much bigger room on the 11th floor with the windows facing the town and a discount on the rate of the first 3 nights. We went to Niagara Falls that whole day looking forward to returning to a better rest that night. We got to know the room better after dinner when we showered. There was no hairdryer, so I'd to go with wet hair to bed. The toilet leaked when flushed - a pool of water of unknown quality gathered on the floor, which we used the floor mat to soak up - yeeks! On Wednesday, we'd only 3/4 day to flight home. I went down in the morning to checkout and sign the bill. Knowing their checkout time to be 11am, I asked if we could hold the room till 3pm as our flight was at 7pm. The Front Desk personnel said that there would be a charge of $20. The presented bill showed full charges for all 4 nights. I asked what happened to the discount on the rate of the first 3 nights offered by the Day Manager and he replied he knew nothing of it. When I wanted to sign the bill he took it back, said that it was not necessary to be signed and that it will be booked against my card. I noted the total of the bill was Cn$741, but there was no copy given to me. They did not mention that they still had my card nor attempted to return it to me. After a short trip to town and lunch I returned to the hotel to get ready for trip to airport. I asked the concierge to book us a Taxi. There was an official flat rate of $50 to the airport. The Taxi charged me $55, the extra $5 being for the hotel, which made the booking. Upon arrival home, I noticed my card had not been returned and stopped it.

I was here for a week on business and most of the uni is within a couple of blocks. My room was fairly small and the furniture was well worn although reasonably clean. The aircon was ancient and incredibly noisy so best turned off at night. The bathroom complemented the room - ready for renovation but plenty of hot water and clean towels. No complaints because it's what you expect in this price bracket. A better than average flat screen TV had a good choice of channels including BBC World. Wi-fi was expensive for short stays but almost reasonable on the weekly plan. The restaurant was disappointing. Breakfast was a total shambles with only one effective member of staff struggling to keep her head above water. On my second day the whole sequence took over an hour and I decided to look elsewhere next day. The restaurant was almost deserted in the evening and had a really depressing atmosphere. Service was grim with one unsmiling waiter who delivered food wordlessly. So, I didn't go back in the evening either! As an alternative try Senator Restaurant (www.thesenator.com) which is just round the corner, 2 minutes walk. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner - and everything about it is the opposite of Bond Place. Great food, friendly service, chatty staff, top background music! There's also a diner just down the street from Bond Place (on Dundas - just across the parking lot) but I didn't try it. Like other writers, I also found the hotel noisy from time to time. Worst was a massive party of kids (I think there were about 300 of them but perhaps it just seemed that way!) who took over the lobby and the lifts one evening. They weren't any trouble, just over excited and under supervised. The immediate vicinity isn't too attractive: there's a major building project underway right next door so lots of dust, sidewalks closed, construction traffic...... Many of the shops sell either trashy souvenirs or cheap fashion. There's a couple of food outlets in the cinema complex (AMT) and of course, loads of food court options in the Eaton Mall which is 5 minutes away.

South on Yong is the way down to the financial district/CN Tower/HHOF/ACC/Skydome, etc--about a 20 min walk. 2. You dont pay for what you dont need. I came up for a hockey game and didnt need to spend $150-$300 a night for a huge hotel with all types of amentities. All I needed was a clean basic room with a bed and shower. Room service and shower were fine. There was a small restaurant downstairs which was perfect for breakfast. The Imperial Pub right across the street will fill you needs for a bar and snack food. 3. Staff was great. I didnt use the concierge, but he was there. All people behind the counter were very friendly and helpful. Can't ask for better than that. 4.

However, I would say that location is one of the only plus' in this hotel. First of all, they try to charge you for almost anything. There is an extra charge to use internet. There is an extra charge to park your car. I understand the parking fee, but still maybe a little discount for its guests for parking? $15.00 a day for parking is a little bit too much. In an age where free WiFi internet is almost everywhere, they have to charge $3.00 an hour for it. It should be free for its guests. I stayed for 4 nights and I am not lying, 3 of the 4 nights, I woke up in the middle of the night because of disturbance. 2 of the 4 nights, I woke up to some worker drilling the wall at the hotel and 1 of the 4 nights, I woke up to a false fire alarm at 4 in the morning. I do not know if this is how it usually is there, but that was my experience. Again, the rooms and stuff itself is not that bad. I liked it. I just hated the fact that they try to charge for almost anything. Parking, internet, movies, etc.. Oh I booked a room and I requested 2 double beds instead of 2 twin beds, they said that I would have to pay $30 EXTRA per night if I wanted a 2 double bed room rather than a 2 twin bed room. To me, that was ridicules. And yes, while I was staying there, I am sure no one was using the 2 double bed room they had, but oh well, who cares about the guests. Once they pay and check it, too bad.

It wasn't the worst hotel in the world but it wasn't incredibly comfortable either. We were on the 8th floor in a double room. The room itself was clean and a decent size. The weather was hot and humid while we were there and the 'Air Conditioning' was rubbish. It just blew slighly cold air out and didn't make the room any more comfortable. Opening the window was a bit pointless as there was no breeze outside so we just sweated a lot! The location of the hotel is excellent. Right by Dundas Square with a street car that stops outside, which runs up and down Dundas. We found this the best way to get around although if you prefer the underground, the station is only a stones throw away. The Eaton Centre is right over the road as well as a shed loads of other shops and a new cinema. We got the feeling that Dundas Square, which is right next to the hotel, is trying to be Toronto's answer to Times Square. While we were there there was a Regae festival and a Turkish festival going on in the square so it was really busy around the area but we didn't notice much noise at night. In fact there was more noise coming from the pub opposite although it never kept us awake or anything. The staff were mostly really nice. They had their dim moments but when we needed help they were really helpful. Didn't eat at the restaurant because, well, it looked rubbish and with the amount of other restaurants around (Spring Rolls on Dundas was well nice) there is so much choice. I don't think I'd stay here again, especially not in summer! We didn't spend loads of time in our room anyway but it is nice to have somewhere to chill out after a hard days sightseeing and I just always wanted to get out of the room as soon as I could!

I tried to ring housekeeping and got no answer so my husband went to the front desk to ask for another towel and was told that housekeeping comes on at 8.30a.m. After he explained (in no uncertain terms) that we were actually having a shower now and not at 8.30 we were eventually given another towel.

It was a Mom and Daughter weekend...so we asked for a non smoking room with two single beds and also requested a room with a view. We got everything we asked for. The room was on the 16th floor and overlooked Dundas Square and the giant tv screens in the square. It was only a 5 minute walk from the subway, the Cannon Theatre and Eatons Centre. We thought the location was fantastic. The rooms are small but spotlessly clean with nice new bedding. Very comfy. We never ate in the restuarant but it looked plain, clean and nice. There is a small bar in the basement that was also nice and it serves free snacks for an hour in the evening. The staff were pleasant and welcoming. We asked for late checkout and it was instantly provided. They will also store your luggage for you if you are leaving late. There is an airport bus that stops right outside the hotel...you can buy your tickets in the hotel or on the bus. (Leave early because the bus stops at a lot of other downtown hotels) There is also a scruffy little restaurant directly across the street...it only has three tables..that sit two people to each table. Go there for breakfast. Its cheap and very good. Just like Mom's home cooking. There is also a pub across the street. Not the nicest looking...but a good place to sit down and have a drink after a long day shopping.

It was my first trip to Canada and the Hotel was booked through United Vacations. I have read some bad reviews about staff and reservation problems, but I didn't experience any. I found the staff could have been a little friendlier, but i guess it wasn't too bad. The location of the Hotel is excellent, especially with one of my favorite sandwich places, Subway, right across the street. :) The room was suitably sized for me, not too big but not too small either. Standard Cable in the room and all usual stuff. The bathroom was well looked after with the best shower I've ever used. The pressure was excellent, in fact, too sore to use at full pressure. Excellent. The view from the window wasn't great as it faced away from downtown, but you don't really pay for a view, do you? There were a few dodgy people hanging around outside in the neighbourhood at night and we witness suspect people sneaking into the hotel and being removed by the manager which made me worry about security but we used a safety deposit box at reception and the door had a safety chian which helped. The only place to get drinks when we stayed was from a vending machine on the floor below reception which was a long trek and at night reception was deserted and it felt a little creepy, but that may just have been me. :) The Hotel also had a day trip rep that set up in the Lobby in the Mornings and we get a great deal on a day trip to Niagara Falls from them. We were picked up from right outside the hotel and the rep was kind enough to let us know when the bus arrived to save us waiting around in the snow. Great trip and they offered quite a few good deals. Worth checking out if it still happens. To sum up, for the price, the hotel was great. Being just a block away from the Eaton Centre, right next to a Hard Rock Cafe and Subway and having to walk just a block or two to get downtown made the stay worth while. Staff could have been a little cheerier, but they did offer free storage of our bags between checkout and heading to the airport, which is a bonus. if I visited Toronto again, I think I might pick a different place, but that's through no fault of the Bond Place, would just like to try out a different hotel.", "Date": "August 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "lngkparr", "ReviewID": "UR3736919", "Content": "We spent 4 nights at the Bond Place in April and thoroughly enjoyed it.

We're newlyweds, and without being too risque, we preferred to share a bed. Phoning down to the front desk did us no good, as we were informed that there were no rooms to switch us with. What annoyed me was the receptionist asking us for smoking or non, which indicates that there are in fact other rooms to be had. There were a lot of people complaining at the front desk later on that night about wanting rooms with double beds as that is what they had booked. So we weren't the only ones sleeping like we were in 1952. Despite the staff being friendly and helpful at all times, we came home with bites of some sort.
