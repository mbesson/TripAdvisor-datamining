I love Hyatts and have enjoyed the new brands, so I didn't think twice about it. Despite very the very cheery and polite front desk staff of Shelby and Grace, I won't be back. Problems: -Our room wasn't made up after the first morning of our stay. We got back to the room at 4pm and it was too late as housekeeping left for the day. -Of the 5 machines in the gym, only 1 worked properly. They don't maintain the equipment (no service plan) so it's no shock. It was quite amusing to see the manager try to make the treadmill belt move by pushing it thinking it would all of a sudden get working. He definitely wasn't the friendliest person I've met in a hotel. -They have flat screen TVs in all rooms, but with a very oversplit analog cable service, it looks like the cable in my fraternity house 20 years ago - fuzzy at best, and definitely not fitting the HDTVs. -Two of the lights in my bathroom were out - housekeeping didn't tell maintenance to fix. -They did a nice job with the carpeting and floor in the living room/kitchen, but for some reason the rubber strip that connects the two had gaps in it. -Rusty exhaust vent covers in the bathroom. -Very noisy a/c in the room. -Very dirty windows (not that there's a view of anything worth looking at). -$12/day for parking. Seriously? That's just plain greedy for a business hotel like this. -Horrible bandwidth. It's provisioned down to 0.5MB. After 30 minutes on the phone with tech support on Saturday morning at 7:30am, he took the filters off my MAC address and got me 3MB. 0.5MB is so 1999 and won't support modern VPN connections. -The cabinets in the bathroom and kitchen used to be some sort of wood grain, but instead of replacing or refacing them, they merely painted them some sort of dull brown color which is a stark contrast to the stainless steel appliance (in the kitchen). One of the cabinet doors in the kitchen was pretty crooked too, making it look worse. The only other positive was the bed. Thankfully they have the wonderful Hyatt beds so at least we slept.

We reserved 4 hotel suites for the Women of Faith Conference at the American Airlines Center back in May 2011. The conference was in August 2011, and we called the week before to confirm everything about our rooms. When we got there the lobby was crowded with women from around the US trying to get checked into their rooms. When it was our group leader's turn, the front desk manager informed her that they had doubled booked our rooms, and the other guests had already arrived. We found out that this had happened to several other women too. The hotel ended up booking us another hotel and they paid for it which was nice, and they really had no choice because our group leader was furious! We ended up 30 minutes from where we needed to be with no restaurants near us within walking distance. We had to depend on the shuttle service from the hotel that messed up the reservations instead of the one they took us to. It really made it hard getting back and forth to where we needed to be all weekend. The hotel General Manager, Jeff Jones gave us each a gift certificate for a two day stay at another time for up to a year. We have to call and book the room and mention the gift certificate and give the voucher number when we make the reservation. The certificate isn't good for holidays or black out days, standard policy, no problem; right! I call for the weekend of September 10th-11th to use my two days for my daughter and her husband for my daughter's 25th birthday. I tell the front desk who I am, and the lady says that I have to talk to Mr. Jones myself. She puts me through, and I get his voice mail. I leave a message and five hours later the front desk lady that I talked to earlier calls me back. She states that the GM is busy and asked her to relay a message to me that they are all booked up and that weekend is a \"blackout\" date. I asked her about another weekend, and she says that they are booked for the next few weeks. They have one night available on September 24th. I told her that wasn't a good weekend for us. She said that I could call back in October and try to book another date and time. But I would have to call and see when the black out dates are because they change every month. She stated that they are really busy during the holidays and that I would need to call as soon as possible in order to see if I can use my certificate then. Needless to say, I was upset again, some hotel this is turning out to be! I looked up the hotel reservation line's number and called. I told the lady that I was looking for a suite for this weekend, the 10th - 11th. She said no problem we have several different suites to choose from. She asked if I had a preference, and I told her no. I also asked her that I had some friends that were looking for rooms as well, and that I would need to book four more rooms. She said that isn't a problem, but they might not be side by side. I said that was fine, and asked her again that you have several rooms available, and she said yes. Then I told the lady that I had called the hotel itself and asked about making a reservation, and that I was told the hotel was completely sold out. The lady said well, I don't understand, there must have been a cancellation since you called. I told her that I would get back to her about the reservation and hung up. It makes me wonder if I will ever use this voucher, and I wonder why the GM was lying to me. He didn't even have the courtesy to call me himself. I don't know why I would even want to stay here, much less recommend it to a friend or family member.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "La Vernia Texas", "Title": "\u201cSay here you won't be dissapointed\u201d", "Author": "Lostpiper", "ReviewID": "UR117321930", "Content": "This hotel is easy to get to from Interstate 35 North .

The hotel was remodeled and given a much-needed facelift in 2006. All of the rooms have a kitchenette with basic cooking utensils, full-size fridge, microwave but no oven, and two-burner stove. Many of the rooms have a separate bedroom (don't know what they call that) with a little dressing room area separate from the bathroom. The regular rooms have a bedroom separated from the living room by a divider/storage shelf unit with drawers and housing a flat-screen TV (DVD players included, no BluRay). The rooms facing west onto Harry Hines can get really hot in the summer, so I leave the drapes closed. Those are also the noisiest rooms, and the traffic noise even late at night can awaken a light sleeper. There is breakfast every day starting at 6 a.m. (7 on Sat.-Sun.) with Starbuck's coffee, fruit, cereal, those horrible fake homogenized eggs (Guys, there are 10 million chickens within 100 miles of Dallas; can you not do some REAL EGGS?), usually limp bacon or near-ham, potatoes or waffles, it's all edible if not exactly awe-inspiring. There is also a \"social hour\" from 5:30-7 pm Mon.-Thurs., with beer, wine, fruit, salad, cheese, cold cuts, soup, and usually a choice of hot bar items such as hot wings, pizza, nachos, and that horrible salty spinach-asparagus cheese dip (who eats that stuff?). Again, some nights you can make a meal, other nights are worth skipping. But the beds are super-comfortable, and the cleanliness is OK if not great (I can't stand to go barefoot in the room, always socks or flip-flops), and having a kitchen in the room makes my long business stays tolerable. There is a decent Kroger over on Cedar Springs in the gay neighborhood, or for more upscale you can go to Whole Foods on Lemmon. Lots of restaurants in the area worth trying, too many to name, but my faves are Herrera's for Mexican, on Maple, Truluck's, pricy on McKinney, and the cozy La Madeleine on Lemmon for an occasional French breakfast or crepe. One other gripe, however. Despite being a Diamond Platinum Hyatt member, the turnover at this hotel is so high that nobody knows my name.

I had never stayed at a Hyatt Summerfield before, and was pretty impressed by the quality of the rooms. I stayed in a King Studio Suite which meant everything but the bathroom and closet were in one space, but the layout of the room did a good job separating the living room, kitchen and bedroom areas. The living room had a flat screen television and a DVD/CD player, a nice spacious desk and a comfortable couch. The kitchenette was a good size for a hotel room. Not large, but certainly not cramped. The only thing it was missing was an oven, which I might miss if I was staying here for an extended period, but for a quick weekend the 2 burner stove, microwave, dishwasher, sink, and full fridge and freezer were more than enough for my needs. I never had to use it, but I noticed the hotel had dishwashing liquid beneath the sink, and the drawers and cupboards were equipped with a small selection of pretty much everything one would need for the kitchen. There was even a wine corkscrew and a pasta strainer. The bathroom was a little small, but not too bad. The provided toiletries are of good quality and I was very impressed with the water pressure in the shower. It's better than I have at home! My only complaint about the comfort of the room is that the mattress is a bit harder than I care for. It wasn't terrible, but I felt a bit stiff in the morning. The bedding was high quality though, plenty of pillows and blankets that are better than your average hotel's. The facilities here were very nice as well. I didn't stay long enough to make use of the pool (wasn't really warm enough anyway), business center, or the fitness area, but the free wi-fi was really easy to access and was pretty fast. I was also comforted by the security of the hotel's parking garage. I was traveling by myself so safety is a concern, but the small parking garage was gated and required room key access, was well lit, and you could park on the same floor as your room, with the doors from the parking garage opening straight into the hotel's hallway so there wasn't a long walk from your car to the lobby and then up to your room. The door between the garage and the hotel required your room key again so there was a second level of security. This made things feel safe as well as convenient. I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Everything was nice and clean and the staff were very helpful and friendly. I'm not sure if I would return to this particular hotel as I tend to get hopelessly lost when forced to drive around downtown Dallas (I got lost on the way back to the hotel both nights of my stay), but I will definitely check out other locations for this chain in the future.

I think most of the clientelle is business travellers who are there for more than a few days, but they rent out their extra units on a nightly basis for a very very affordable rate. The units are exceptionally clean, have a full kitchen, and the parking situation is outstanding. Basically, there is a parking garage next to the hotel, with an keyed-entry on every floor so you can basically park right on your floor. It's very convenient if you have groceries or large luggage. You can come as you go as you please, and parking is free. There is no restaurant, but there is a little market where you can buy stuff to keep in your refrigerator or cook on your cooktop. There also is a better-than-I-expected buffet breakfast. The key advantage to this place is if you're going to events at American Airlines arean. The arena is a 6 minute walk if you take the short cut, and a 7 minute walk if you don't. In other words, it's very close. Several of the people staying there seemed to be folks from far away places in Texas that came for games (the mavericks and the stars play at AA) and didn't want to do the back and forth drive in one day. The price was unbelievable -- we got an AAA deal that was less than a third of the price of the fancy W hotel which is also right near the arena. It's a little hard to find from the highway, so the front desk staff seemed a bit overwhelmed at times having to be on the phone to give directions. But they were otherwise very friendly and helpful. Given the nature of the extended stay accomodations and the fact that each room has a big kitchen and stuff, housekeeping takes a while, so I got the sense that early check ins and late check outs are rare. If you're looking for a full comprehensive Dallas vacation hotel, this is probably not the place location wise.

I return the front desk on Tuesday morning and let them know that this is the 3rd time that I asked for my tub to be cleaned, they assured me that they would have housekeeping clean it. Upon my return on Tuesday evening, I find that my bed has been made, fresh towls put out and dishes done, but my TUB IS STILL DIRTY!!!!!!! I call down to the front desk, and let them know that my tub was still dirty and someone needs to come up and clean it while I am here. He said that the cleaning crew was gone and he would come up and clean it himself as soon as he gets a chance. 10:30pm he came up to clean the tub himselft and said that he is not housekeeping and would do the best he can. I will not stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "November 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burleson", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for the price\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5011834", "Content": "We stayed the weekend for a concert at the Magnolia Theater and loved it.

We didn't partake of the continental breakfast, so I have no opinion on that. Also didn't use the pool & hot tub, but it looked clean and well-kept. The only negative was that none of the maids on our floor spoke English, so just getting towels & pillows instead of full housekeeping service was a challenge. Eventually told the maids to NOT clean the room and went downstairs to the front desk for my towels.

Worth more than that if you had no other \"discounted options\" for sure. Positives: Great location just on the edge of downtown, a 10 minute walk from American Airlines Center. Free covered parking. Comfortable bed, quiet, good HVAC, very clean and has a small kitchen to boot. No complaints at all about the room. So-So: The continental breakfast was pretty mediocre. The usual cereal, juice, coffee and a couple of dreary hot selections (think HS Cafeteria). Their coffee cake is right out of the supermarket bakery, little taste. Only a handful of tables to eat, so not exactly a \"welcoming\" area if you get down there and all the tables are taken. Could be much better if a bit more attention was given. Unfortunately, the hotel insists on using Air Freshener everyday throughout each hallway. After the first day, it just became more and more annoying. We're not talking about a \"spritz\" here and there, I actually saw the maid walking down the hallway blasting it the WHOLE length of each corridor. Sort of like having to walk thru a Roach Motel before you get to your room (didn't affect the smell in the room). They do have two computers to use for free, with free printing, but they must cater to some local college students because it was difficult to find them open to use...no matter what time of day. But, hey, free is free! Average: Although the maid service was very good, the Front Desk was \"OK\", but not too friendly. The kind of folks that would answer your questions, but wouldn't exactly give you a warm welcome when you approached the desk. Not bad, just not impressed. Overall: I would absolutely stay there again, esp at the rate I got. I'd probably be willing to pay up to $70 per night if I had to.

(Guests who stayed at the pricier Hotel Lawrence had all kinds of complaints about their accommodations.) Our studio suite was very spacious, comfortable, and clean; it had separate living/dining and sleeping areas, a large bathroom, a good amount of closet/storage space, and a well-equipped kitchen. A table and chairs served as the dining/work area, and the living area had a comfortable sofa and recliner facing a TV with free expanded cable and HBO, as well as a VCR and movies-on-demand. The kitchen included a refrigerator, microwave, stove burners, toaster, coffeemaker, dishwasher, glasses, dishes, pots, and utensils. The hotel provided a \"First Nighter\" move-in package with coffee, microwave popcorn, a couple of NutriGrain bars, a bottle of water, etc. (It was a very welcome touch, since we arrived at the hotel after 11pm and had a serious case of the munchies.) The bed was comfortable, the towels and linens were clean and in good shape, and mini soaps and shampoo were provided (which isn't always the case with extended-stay hotels). We had a special wedding guest rate of $69/night (AAA members can get the same discount rate). The rate included free secured parking, free local calls, and a pretty decent free continental breakfast. Guests staying less than seven days pay a per-night rate instead of the more economical weekly rate, so daily \"freshen-up\" housekeeping service was also included in our rate. The hotel also offers a pool, spa, fitness center, and business center with high-speed Internet access.
