Comfortable bed, great breakfast layout, very helpful and friendly front desk who confirmed a tour booking for us with a big smile and asked upon our return how it was! Great central location and wonderful restaurants and shops nearby too. Would have liked having an English tv channel though such as BBC to catch the weather and news back in the states.

I am used to single rooms not being the premium rooms but this room was dismal. No place for my luggage and the \"window\" looked onto an interior piping shaft for the building. It was covered with drapes to give a window effect but the room was without any natural light. The interior lighting was poor as there was no ceiling light, just one over the bed and lights on one wall. As a solo traveller assistance from hotel staff re: restaurants, tours, safety, etc. is important. The day of arrival I asked reception for a restaurant recommendation and was told \"go right or left\". Another tourist in the lobby gave me some advice. A request for brochures was met with a shrug. I went to the main hotel and was told he was part-time staff. There was some little improvement in reception staff but not much. In the morning I asked if the bedspread could be changed as it stunk of cigarette smoke. This request seemed to irritate the new (and as I had bveen told, better) man and indeed was not done until I spoke to the cleaning lady, who was extremely accommodating.The bathroom was clean and appeared to have been recently renovated. The walls were thin and movement and talking could be heard from adjacent rooms. The water pump malfunctioned one night and as it was right outside my \"window\" it kept me awake all night.

When I requested some form of compensation I was told I should have complained earlier and they would have moved me. Pardon my consideration. I was told I had already been put in a double room and when I pointed out the deficiencies it became a \"one and a half\" room. A half??? A half of what???

If you are assigned to Room 329, please be aware that the toilet in the room next door is adjacent to the headboard of your bed! When it flushes, it is extremely loud. Needless to say, we were a bit annoyed by the lack of sleep. However, the free use of the hotel computers and Wi-Fi are great, the breakfast is plentiful, and the location is very good.

First off, the location is excellent as it is 3 blocks from the Stazione Termini which is the ending (and beginning) terminal for trains, subways and buses which made it very convenient for transportation. Be sure to buy the Roma Pass. Getting to the Vatican and other sites was very easy and quick. However, Rome is also a very walkable city. From the Sonya, we walked to the Coliseum, the Forum and then to lunch, ending at the Spanish Steps. Be aware, however, that this is a lot of walking althought it is mostly flat and I had little problem, even while awaiting a second hip replacement, except for the distance.. The hotel itself is very Italian, with marble entries, attentive staff and an old fashioned elevator with wire gates. The rooms were basic but spacious, well maintained and had windows that actually opened across from the Opera House so one can listen to the City sounds day or night. We often found cleaning staff in the hallways diligently working. The only complaint I had about the room was one had to turn sideways to enter the shower. Also, to get ice for cold drinks after a long day sightseeing, you have to go to the front desk . The breakfasts were typically Italian but good and hearty, with cold eggs, ham, fruit and rolls. Although it was self serve, the wait staff were very friendly,humorous and competent with bringing us divine capuccinos; we usually had at least 2 each, sometimes more. The front desk staff was very helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations.

Then he forgot to give us the usernam password for wireless. In the room the toilet paper roll was empty not replaced. The room was so tiny I barely fit in the shower stall. There was no way to contact the reception, I had to go down to ask the same person at the desk how to dial the reception. Everything seemed so old- the furniture, th beds, the blinds. Oh and there is no housekeeping late in the night to help you with something. Example: we wanted an extra towel I had to go down to the reception to ask for ne and I was tol they dont have one, I asked him to check inside and guess what they had one, the person was too lazy to go check. The safe in th room was not digital... Out of 10 hotels we stayed in this was the only one. I didn't feel safe putting my valuables in safe with a key not knowing who else might have a duplicate. Te reason I booked is hotel is that, they were offering a promotion of 2 free tickets forbth open bus tour. When I asked them for it they said that the \"green line tour \" was not operating in June 2nd for national day, w asked around and that tour was on strike. When I asked for the other tour tickets they refused, I felt really cheated. The hotel is in a building with other residents who have their home there, something that really put me off.

Upon our arrival, we were told that a room was available in the hotel's recently renovated annex. A staff member promptly escorted us to the annex, located half a block to the north on Via Firenze. Bear in mind that comments in this review concerning the room and amenities pertain only to the Hotel Sonya's annex, not to the main portion the hotel. We chose the Sonya primarily for its location, about a quarter of a mile northwest of the main Termini train station in central Rome. It takes about 10 minutes to walk from the hotel to the station entrance, plus another 5 to 10 minutes to reach the platforms (15 for the airport train platform). In other words, the hotel is close enough to the station to be convenient, but just far enough removed to provide some distance from the noise and congestion. The neighborhood in which the hotel is located is relatively modern (mid to late 19th century). It's not among the most atmospheric parts of Rome, but it is very convenient for accessing most parts of central Rome on foot or via public transit. It takes about 25 to 30 minutes to walk west to the Trevi Fountain or north to the Villa Borghese. If you don't want to walk, you can take one of several bus routes into the center on nearby Via Nazionale. Also within easy walkding distance is the Repubblica metro stop, from which you can access the Vatican or the Colosseum. Our room in the annex was comfortably furnished and included a small flat panel television mounted above the desk. A large wardrobe unit contained ample storage space as well as a safe for valuables. Another nice feature was the balcony, which provided plenty of fresh air and made us feel like we were part of the neighborhood, even though the view (across the street to the side of the opera house) was less than spectacular. We experienced little traffic noise, as Via Firenze is not a major thoroughfare. The windows are well-insulated and do a good job of keeping out what noise there is when they are closed. We only used the ceiling-mounted air conditioning unit briefly, but it was quiet and capable of cooling the room quickly when needed. The bathroom was relatively large by Roman standards. At first glance, it looked a bit retro with lots of vintage marble on the walls, but the fixtures and the plumbing had been updated. There was even a jacuzzi tub, although the on/off switch was inconveniently located inside the bedroom. Everything in both the room and bathroom was clean and tidy. A complimentary continental breakfast buffet was served on the ground floor of the Hotel Sonya's annex. It provided a good selection of cold foods, including a vegetable tart, hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, indivdually wrapped portions of proscuito and salami, some fresh fruits, and various baked goods, plus coffee prepared to order. The staff members we encountered in the breakfast room and at the front desk were consistently friendly and helpful. When booking our room online, we took advantage of the 5 percent discount if payment is made in cash upon departure. The cash discount saved us 30 euros off the price of the room, which helped to offset the fact that the euro had appreciated against the dollar between the time we planned our trip and the time of our depature. With the cash discount, we paid just under 150 euros per night for our room, which we felt was reasonable considering the central location and the quality of the accommodations. We also appreciated not be charged for the bottled water we consumed from the mini bar. The Hotel Sonya annex met all of our expectations.

It is very easy to get to Vatican City on the underground from the hotel as well, the stop is about 5 min walk from the hotel and is 1 euro for the 5 min subway ride which stops about 6-7 blocks from the Vatican (the hotel can advise the name of the stops).

We were amazed at the proximity of the hotel to all the major attractions, we reached everywhere by walking - apart from the Vatican, which we used the metro from Republica station a few minutes walk away. When the staff realised we were celebrating a 40th birthday, they knocked the door with a bottle of wine and a letter to say 'happy birthday' which we thought was a really lovely touch. The breakfasts were great - we particularly enjoyed the pizza rustica! Warm croissants, ham, cheese, cereals and yoghurts were more than enough. The staff were so friendly and nothing was too much trouble, service was excellent and someone was always on hand with information and advice. The free wifi was a godsend too for being able to email all our photos home! We didn't use the mini bar but it was lovely to have a fridge in the room.

Luckily, it opened a short time later, but check with the airport before you get there to see the hours for each airport shuttle desk, they vary depending on the terminal you arrive in. You may have to go to a different terminal for an open kiosk. The service at the hotel was pretty lame. The people working the front desk were less than friendly and didn't go out of their way to make you feel welcome. They also weren't very knowledgeable about the surrounding local attractions or restaurants to go to. We pretty much did our own research. Our room was actual very nice and pretty spacious for Rome and really modern. It was very clean as was the bathroom. No complaints in that department!

When I could not get the tv to work, he came up to fix it and when I could not get the aircon to work, he came up to show me. In other words, service was quick and with a smile. Ivan also recommended a very good restaurant around the corner. Since I had only two days i n Rome, I wanted to see the sites that I missed on our first two trips to Rome. Ivan helped me with planning my itinerary. It helps a lot too that the hotel is vey close to the Metro station. This is an added bonus when you are travelling on your own in Europe. The waiter during breakfast- Jorre (I hope I am spelling his name correctly; if not, mi dispiace), was very courteous and attentive. Breakfast is free and quite good- esp. the cappucino.

Hotel Sonya pleasantly surprised me, and I'd stay there again in a future visit. Our room was lovely and I felt safe walking around the vicinity with my family although we were clearly tourists. The continental breakfast was the most enjoyable part of our stay. There was much more variety than we expected so everyone had something they wanted to eat. Since we woke up early in the morning, we were able to eat in the room adjacent to the reception desk. The employees helping out with breakfast were especially friendly.

Though small by American standards the room was spotless and accommodated our needs very well. We found the bed and pillows too firm (hard!), a small complaint. The room was cleaned and fresh towels provided daily. All amenities claimed were provided, including AC which worked well. The lift is old, quaint and great fun actually. Breakfast was quite good with a variety of pastries, including cereal with low fat milk if desired and adequate Americano coffee. It suited our needs. We selected Hotel Sonya based on this site\u2019s reviews and its location, an easy walk to Rome Termini where all forms of transportation is available. We used the Green Line open deck bus primarily. Around the corner at Via Nappoli 4 is Antian Boheme, great menu, fairly priced and excellent service. Ask for a jug of the house red wine. 8 Euro worth serves four nicely, a good value. Straight out of the hotel entrance walk a long block on Via Firenze to Via Nazionale where Byron\u2019s is located. It is very casual, inexpensive, adequate menu and offers an excellent house Chianti. The hotel location proved to be safe and quiet enough though I will admit the general pace of life and traffic in Rome drove me crazy (getting too old perhaps). All said, we would stay again and booked friends in for a short pre-cruise stay. They would agree with the above.", "Date": "October 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "waterford, ireland", "Title": "\u201can ideal base for visit to Rome, friendly staff, clean and comfortable room\u201d", "Author": "joandun", "ReviewID": "UR47088520", "Content": "Hotel Sonya is ideally placed if you want to see rome on foot.

It occupies a part of a usual apartment house in the centre of Rome, on each ladder platform of each floor 3 sound wooden doors: directly opposite to an exit from the lift an input in a hotel corridor from which there are doors to numbers, and to the right and on the left doors of apartments in which there live the Roman citizens (see the photo). The system of electronic keys Everywhere works-at an input from a ladder, at an input in number. Advantages, important for me: 1. An excellent arrangement: in 200 metres from via Nazionale (used buses much) and in 500 metres from Termini (was going to go for one day to Florence). 2. Pure silent number (5 floor) in which there is a table, a minibar, a case, the TV, the safe, a teapot and tea-coffee-sugar, the conditioner (which I periodically included on heating). The window left directly on opera theatre-beauty. A bathroom with a per capita cabin which in the sizes is quite convenient, a dryer for towels and with all necessary [--] which worked. Towels changed every day. 3. Good sound insulation if only neighbours did not rustle in a corridor about my door. And when all were in numbers-silences. Only, sometimes someone silently played music behind a wall, probably, the neighbour-Roman. It was very lovely! 4. A breakfast: flakes of 2 kinds, yoghurt (tasty), sausage , cheese (triangles in a foil), oil (it was not pleasant to me, has bought and ate the). Batches - my favourite pie with spinach (the dough as for a pizza) - super! Any fruitcakes and pies (2-3 kinds), croissants, simple rolls (1 kind), all fresh, warm. Fruit-oranges, apples, bananas. Juice. And at last, the waiter brings coffee - by request. Cappuchino it is very good, once tried chocolate, too it is tasty. 5. In a hall always in an easy approach 3 computers with Internet connection. 6. Since I do not know English, and I speak in French a little, for me it was important, that one of employees on reception spoke in French. 7. The kind personnel though no problems at me existing and to check up them in a stressful situation it was not necessary, and thank God! 8. Presence shuttle the airport-hotel and hotel-airport at the price of 14 euros (in one party). Lacks, for me not having special value: 1. A room and a bathroom small on the area. 2. A floor everywhere stone, that is good, probably, in a heat. And when the temperature and reaches in the evening to-1 it is cold at night.

We were a group of 7 and we had booked this hotel a few months in advance. When we arrived in Rome, and then at the hotel, they had no record of us. They said our reservation was at a hotel down the street and not at Sonya Suites as they did not have the rooms to accomodate us. We were very disappointed and realized that this huge building (featured in the photo of the hotel) is not actually the hotel. They are a little grotto in that building with only a few rooms. We went to this other hotel and were horrified at what we saw. The rooms were seedy to say the least and the floors were shared with people actually living there. Cigarette butts on the stairwell. We were so creeped out. You know the kind of room that you think you might catch something from. You know those hotels that you walk past that are just a doorway on the street, and they look so nasty even from the sidewalk. Well, this is where we were sent. We were hungry and sick of fighting with the front desk, and ate at a bistro that was next to the Mondial (Best Western) and my sister went in to that hotel and asked about rooms. They had rooms so she booked them and after lunch we went back to the other hotel and left. They were not happy as they wanted to charge us but we said that if they push this then we will call the police as we had been deceived by Sonya Suites. This hotel had also said that they had a good rating from Tripadvisor. That was so hard to believe. We left this hotel and never looked back. The Mondial was such an improvement even though my son and I had the misfortune to hear the next room fornicating. Way too much information for a mother and son. The walls there were paper thin, but such a step up from the other place. When I find out what the hotel name was that we thought was Sonya Suites, I will update this review. Be very careful when booking at the Sonya Suites and don't be decieved by the photo that is featured in their ad.

And we discovered that the Metro station is also in the Termini, a nice bonus and very convienent. The breakfast there was the best of all the breakfasts we enjoyed on our 18 day trip. Large selection of breads, pastries, cereal, fruit, juices, coffee, etc. Like most things in Rome, it was an old building, but has been updated, everything except for the elevator. It could only carry 2 people and their bags and was totally open. Very neat feature. We also enjoyed the free internet in the lobby. The front desk was very helpful with check in, holding our bags on our check out day, giving directions and offering great suggestions such as directing us to a local market that was only open on Sunday. We paid $140E per night, which you may find a bit cheaper somewhere else, but it did provide the service and met the standards that we would expect from that price range which is always nice. When we originally looked around to book a room we found Rome to be our most expensive venue, but wanted peace of mind transiting to and from the Termini and this fit our desires perfectly. There are other hotels nearby, so you may find a litte less expensive, but if you are not sure and want a sure bet then I recommend Hotel Sonya. I can easily see us staying there again. I strongly do not recommend eating at the nearby restaurants, they get the distinction of serving our 2 worst meals of our entire trip. (How can you screw up pasta?)

In addition, its an easy, and safe, walk from the Termini station, which is very convenient if arriving by air. The hotel itself is very matter-of-fact looking - in fact, like so many Roman buildings, the hotel shares floors with other businesses and apartments. Its actually very interesting to see this mixture, when, all over the world I have usually seen hotels in their own exclusive buildings. This was never a problem though, since I heard very little of anyone else in the 10 days I stayed there. My room was tiny - be prepared for this - and faced out over the opera building (the front of the building, where you enter. Perhaps they have other larger rooms - I don't know. However, it was very nicely done in marble and had a TV with CNN in English. There were no other English channels - something the management should look at improving, I think, given its popularity on Tripadvisor. The room was spotlessly cleaned every day. My only other suggestion with the room, is make sure you have a electric outlet adaptor (or 2, if you have more than one device!). Since the adaptor point is Italian system. The staff could not have been more helpful. I appreciated the fact that when I came down for breakfast, I was offered TWO cappucinos/coffe with milk/juices etc. Breakfast wasn't skimped at all. It was not varied however, in any way, and consisted of rolls, cake, hard boiled eggst, fruit, cereal, and croissants. They will heat anything you ask them to, and do it cheerfully.

Decent breakfast, good coffee, but the breakfast room is tiny. Free internet access at three terminals during the day. There is a supermarket across the street, convenient for quick snacks. There is a mini bar fridge in the room, but it didn\u2019t actually appear to be cold, so don\u2019t count on it for food storage. They advertise an airport shuttle, but I saw at least two people who ended up calling a taxi because the shuttle was a no-show (or extremely late). It is easy to catch the 9 euro shuttle train from Termini to Da Vinci airport, but it is quite a hike to the train platform, so don\u2019t bother if you have a lot of luggage.", "Date": "May 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lawrenceburg, TN", "Title": "\u201cNice, smaller hotel\u201d", "Author": "jmelong", "ReviewID": "UR5224259", "Content": "Nice, very clean, comfortable and quiet hotel situated near Metro and Termini stations.

Our stay was from April 1 to April 8, 2006. The location was perfect for either walking in Rome or hopping a bus to travel throughout Rome. We enjoyed the Farmers/Vendors Market each morning from 7 AM - 1 PM around the corner. The gelato shop, liquor store, and phone calling shop (Teatro dell' Opera) all within a block were all great places. We got to know each of the owners during our stay and they became friends we looked forward to seeing every day. The phone shop (Teatro dell' Opera across the street) offered super deals on long distance calls back to the states for 10 cents per minute; we had been paying $1.00 per minute before we found them. Another plus was having access super market across the street, with good deals. Back to the Hotel Sonya\u2026. The staff and owners were very friendly, we enjoyed the daily breakfast of rolls, fruit, cappuccino and juice. The room was small, functional and very clean and included a shower stall. The wireless internet was a real plus because I could use my laptop in my room. The hotel also offered 3 computers for their guests to use in the lobby. Finally, the price was very fair and the shuttle service was only 12 euro per person to and from the airport, my brother and his son stayed in a nearby hotel and took a taxi for 48 euro.

The previous review mentions that they thought the \"Opera House\" was a picture of the hotel but if you read the previous reviews and look at other travellers pictures - it clearly says a picture of the view from our room! As for rubbish I saw no flies or rubbish outside the hotel. I found the hotel staff very helpful and attentive. With regards to the rooms I can see that there has been previous issues so I will state that we stayed in a room on the 1st floor. Our view was of a side street which was fine as it was quieter than being on the front. The room was quite big - in fact bigger than some 4 star hotels I've stayed at. The bathroom was also fine and my 6ft 4 husband had no problem using the shower. The most important thing to me was that it was clean, the bathroom was spotless. The curtains and bedding were a little tired but again its no different to many 4 star hotels, and this hotel was very reasonably priced in a superb location. Minutes walk from the metro, bus station and main train terminal. There are ample restuarants and bars around the area and you can also walk to many of the sights from here. Breakfast is continental style, with fresh crossiants and cake! Yum! Yes the room is small but its a family run hotel and we found it fine, plus there is a picture of it on the hotel website and its no different. The hotel lobby/reception has two computers in it, where you can access the internet for free. We found this very useful for planning our days out and keeping in touch with home. Check out is at 11am but the hotel staff were happy to look after our luggage so we could maximise our time in room before our flight left. I would recommend this hotel to a friend as it was reasonably priced, clean and in a good location. One thing I think could be improved is that whilst the room is equipped with a kettle there were no tea, coffee, sugar or milk sachets so if you are staying I'm sure you can pick some up on the way!

We didnt leave as it was late at night and we were only there a few nights, so we put up with it. The room was the smallest I have ever stayed and the bathroom was like one you would expect to see in a caravan. The breakfast was poor, in a cramped room with orange squash and not fresh juice.

The breakfast selction and quality was below that of other Italian hotels in the same class and the staff was rude. While the hotel's proximity to the train station is supposed to be a major selling point, it's a good 5 block walk and I think it would be difficult if you had more than a small suitcase. The surrounding neighborhood is filled with restaurants that cater solely to tourists and so the food is mediocre compared to the rest of Rome and the whole area lacks any sense of atmosphere which is so prevalent in the rest of the city. That said, one big positive aspect of the hotel is the shuttle service to the airport. The hotel booked me a a direct shuttle to Fiumicino for only 12 euros.
