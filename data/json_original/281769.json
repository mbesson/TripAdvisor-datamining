Give me a room with a decent bed and i am okay. I guess there is always a first. Shower has no hot water. son found bugs in his bed, Got up in middle of night to use bathroom and a roach ran across the wall. Beds areas comfortable as a roll away and the room smells. Said it was remodeled must have been on outside because rooms have not been touched. We asked if the offered a AAA discount and they were rude and said that our card was charged when we reserved so no. They will tell you what do you expect they are a 2 star and they shouldn't be even that. If you are looking for something a little cheaper find a hotel that offers shuttle to Universal and pay the extra couple dollars. I couldnt wait to leave and I was suppose to be having fun. Right at the bottom of the Universal park they have a parking lot where you can park and take the Universal shuttle to the top. that is my recommendation not to stay at this hotel. Terrible service and Terrible rooms. I felt I had bugs climbing on me all night.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cOnly as a last resort should you stay...\u201d", "Author": "zombielova", "ReviewID": "UR68223929", "Content": "Only as a last resort should you stay here.

Even though I arrived late at night (thanks to flight delays), the front desk staff were there and very helpful. The room facilities were basic, but they were clean and they worked. There was no landline phone in my room, but there was free wifi. So if you're coming from overseas and not bringing your laptop (which you can use to communicate via email, Skype etc.) with you), you need to be prepared for that. But for such an amazingly low room cost, it's hardly something and not really something you can complain about. The walls are quite thin and I could hear normal activity in the room next to me, though it didn't give me any problem sleeping when I needed to sleep. Car parking was plentiful and secure. If you need them, there are strip malls where you can buy stuff to eat and drink within 2-3 blocks. The Google map is a bit deceptive. The distance to the 'touristy' bits of Hollywood is a little bit further than it looks. It took me 17 minutes on foot to the Egyptian Theatre (on the corner of Hollywood and Las Palmas), and I'm a reasonably fast walker, used to travelling on foot within English cities. If you're visiting to see the tourist side of Hollywood and don't mind a bit of exercise, you can leave your car at the motel and explore on foot, but be prepared for a fair bit of walking. Unless you're a very slow walker, Hollywood and Vine subway station to this motel will take you no more than 25 minutes, and from there, a lot of other places in LA are available without needing to rent a car. The only thing I was not impressed with was that on my last day, I asked if I could stay in my room for a couple of hours after the 1100 check-out deadline. My flight was late afternoon. No way, I was told - out by 11 or pay for another night. The impression I got was that there wasn't exactly an influx of new guests waiting to move in, and that this was pure inflexibility. But this is such a great location for the price that this is a very minor complaint.", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "scotland", "Title": "\u201cgood value\u201d", "Author": "grimbo77", "ReviewID": "UR43085749", "Content": "great location being only 2 blocks from hollywood boulevard and on pick up route for tour bus. 2 repairs reported and fixed quickly. friendly staff. only downside was no phone in room.", "Date": "September 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWierd room smelled funny but good location, kind of.\u201d", "Author": "Tactic13", "ReviewID": "UR32126483", "Content": "Rolling onto the Sunset strip at 11:00 pm was a bit overwhelming.

The fellow working the desk was strange, not friendly, but not offensive. The price was good so we took the room. The good sized room was clean except for some hair in the bath tub. It smelled a bit funny but we quickly got used to it. The comforters looked like they came from another era, but they were new, wierd! The steel grate on the window made me feel safe.

The manager was rude, and obviously was the cause of of the hotels decline. At one point in time someone had made the attempt to remodel the hotel, but had never bothered to follow up with cleaning the rooms afterwards. The carpet was matted down and black with dirt and sticky to walk on (your feet or socks were black within minutes). The sheets were not changed during our stay, and we suspected they may not have been before we moved in. The towels were thin, and we received no hand towels, just facecloths and bath towels. The room wasn't serviced until almost 6pm. The parking lot is cramped and has fewer spaces than rooms, we just parked and walked everywhere. We booked through Expedia and I'm not quite sure why they rated it a 2 Star hotel. I think someone cooked the books on this one.
