There seemed to be mixed reactions. I felt it was nice enough for the type of hotel that it is - namely, a youth hostel type. I found out about it on the youth hostel website. I did think the rates listed were slightly misleading - it listed its cheapest rate as 25 pounds, when I got there they said the only room available was one for three people which cost 48 pounds. Plus there was a 1 pound plus charge for using my checkcard. It was on the 5th floor or a tiny row-house type building so I had to walk up 4 flights of steps. Neverthless it looked nice enough. It apparently is under new management and has been renovated recently - looked like it had a new paint job. For my purposes I think I am just as happy to walk up since I can do it and I feel more secure that way. They had a bathroom on each floor and there were three small rooms on my floor. The other two rooms filled up - I think one of them may have had their own bathroom. The people I saw seemed very nice. The bathroom was small but adequate. However when I took a shower the water was only lukewarm. The great advantage to this is its location - it is on the next block from Victoria Coach Station and a couple of blocks from Victoria Rail Station. As I understand that London is very pricey I suppose it is a good buy considering. All I wanted was a place to spend the night as I was leaving early next morning and for that purpose it was adequate. They did not include breakfast but Victoria Coach station has lots of fast-food type places inside the station-I especially recommend the ham and cheese pasty for 1pound35. Also there is a small grocery store beside the station. If I go to London again I probably will try something else but it is good to keep in mind in case I need an inexpensive place to stay next to the station.", "Date": "August 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cNot a good choice.\u201d", "Author": "OingoBoingo", "ReviewID": "UR8182593", "Content": "This house is now being managed, along with several other houses on Ebury Street, under Belgravia rooms.

I found the room to be super cute.. thebreakfast was filling and in a super cute dining room. What was the biggest highlight I suppose.. was the man and woman who ran the place. They were the sweetest people ever.. helping us with everything we came to them with.. and we came to them with quite a few things.. asking if we could change our reservation from one night to the next.. asking for an alarm clock.. asking him to keep a lookout for my luggage that would be arriving from the airport the next day as it didnt make my connecting flight. So many things we asked.. and they were friendly and accomodating.. very lovely people. I loved the location.. there were two cute places to eat a block away.. the travelers tavern and the Belgravia.

The breakfast was good, they'll substitute and are willing to accomadate your tastes. One tip though: if you are over 100 lbs. and you are staying in a room with a private bathroom or water closet, you will have trouble fitting into the bathroom. It is literally about 4ft. x 4ft., when you sit on the toilet your face will be up against the door. Everytime you turn around, you will knock something over.

I booked the B&B via internet, but also phoned them, and had a chat with the person in charge. She was very kind, and we looked forward to our stay. Upon arriving we had to wait 10 min. till our room was ready, but we where perhaps a bit early, so it was ok. The staff was very kind and normal, Im writing normal, because I have read many times in this forum, that sometimes people who work at hotels, seem strange and unwilling, and unable to understand anything :-) Our room was up quite a lot of steps, that was a bit narrow. But thats how most b&bs are in London, so that was expected. It can be difficult to drag all your luggage up, so its not for the less able. Though there also is a room on the ground floor. Anyway the room was nice and clean. The bedding a bit on the old side, which I mainly gathered from the colours of them, that was fashionable a long time ago. But it was all very clean. And so was the rest of the B&B by the way, the hall and the breakfast room. We got fresh towels every day, and a cleaning of the room. The bathroom in our room, was very small. It had zink, toilet and shower. It was all contained in one big plastic room, that had been fitted into the room. Difficult to explain. It was small, but clean and it worked fine. The room had a small tv on the wall, and view out to the street, which was very quiet, even though there is only aprox. 5 min. walk to the Victoria Station. A very safe neighborhood. They will hold your luggage for a few pounds. In the breakfast room there was 5-6 tables. All very clean, and quick service. The breakfast was cerials and eggs, beans, toast, juice, coffee and tea. You could basically get all what you could eat. It was no problem to order extra toast :-) We payed 75 pounds a night for a twin ensuite. But know that you can get it for 65 pounds in the Feb.

One of the bunk beds was so bad that all the spare pillows in the room had to be placed on the mattress in order that it was possible to sleep. They did put blankets under the sheets to protect us from the springs on the other two beds. Sleeping on top of the comfortor was an improvement. The wardrobe had one door missing. The night table had a drawer missing and one of the remaining ones front was falling off making it hazardous. When we pointed this out, they did nail it back on. The headboard on the double bed was disgusting--with holes and tears in it--it had been nougahide at one time--a long time ago. The shower door was an accordian type that was coming apart in several places. The toilet roll holder was on by one nail, which kept falling out all the time. We were also not thrilled with the breakfast. Although their ad says eggs plural fried or scrambled. We were only offered one fried egg along with tinned beans, a tinned stewed tomato, tinned mushrooms and a frozen potato something or other that went in the toaster. I notice they mention hot chocolate, but that was never offered either. There was juice, coffee, tea and toast. We did let the management know that we were very disappointed and they did reduce our rate from 95 pounds to 85 per night. The location is great. We did not want to spend our holiday moving around, so stayed on. We did try a b & b one block further on and found they had lovely accommodation for 70 pounds and a full english breakfast.
