I was greeted by the main guy that seems to work there 24/7 (wish i had remembered his name) he got me my keys and off I went. The room was large, warm and clean. Had a view of the street which was fine by me since its located in the old town. The beds were comfortable, and the rooms well equiped with amenities. The bathroom was large with what seemed to be a new jet tub. Heres the only thing that kind of bothered me, the tub has a shower head outlet that you pull out and hold onto it while showering yourself, no big deal Ive used these before, the thing is there was no shower curtain surrounding the tub! I had to lean over the tub to wash my hair. That being said, everything else was great especially the service. The location of this hotel is magnificent, literally a 2 minute walk to the blue mosque and hagia sofia and the under ground basilica (i recommend you see all three). The main street is filled with shops of all kinds. A 15 minute walk in the other direction and you're at the ferry to cross over to the Asian continent. All in all i would highly recommend this hotel, as I stated before the service was exceptional, I had missed my flight leaving Turkey and the next flight was the following day, I returned to the Hotel and the Turkish fellow was able to get me into a room immediately. Great service, great country to visit! A couple of things Id recommend to do in Turkey is eat at as many different restaurants or corner stands as possible, the food is amazing. Get a turkish bath at the oldest turkish bath house in the world, I forgot the name but google it and you'll find it. Also visit the largest indoor market and take advanage of the cheap prices. And last but not least, buy some Turkish Delight!", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reston, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel!
