The original room charges are frankly not exhorbitant at all, so I'd have to say I got a steal. The villa is located smack in the middle of Seminyak, home of the best restaurants in Bali (Ku De Ta, la Lucciola, Oberoi, Warung Made etc). It is not big, with I'd say about 30 villas in total. Quaint on the outside, luxurious on the inside. The reception staff you first meet are very friendly and helpful, speaking good English and have a good sense of humour. The kitchen and other service staff are also nice, and equally helpful.The rooms come with everything you'd want (which is expected for a Villa, duh) - Plasma / LDC TV with a big range of cable TV channels, microwave oven, kitchen, big refrigerator, sofa... Then there's the small attached pool (which for me was underutilised), beach chairs, dining table, large comfy bed... bathtub, and indoor and outdoor (!) shower heads. You can also enjoy yourself at the small spa room there. You'd have to book an appointment beforehand - and these ladies are most likely contracted from elsewhere. Nothing special, but still okay. During my stay, the staff was always helpful, assisting with (free) transport arrangements to Jimabaran and also with booking of restaurants, helping to hire private drivers and assisting to plan our itenarary.In summary, the rooms and facilities were definitely up to standard and the service un-faultable, for a very reasonable price. All you could ever ask for a relaxing trip to Bali.", "Date": "Mar 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR753881221", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Northern_Rock"}, {"Content": "Our Experience 2007 After being put into the wrong room to begin our holiday at Aston Sun Island and having the staff try to fudge off our room for the delux which we paid for we were the next day moved the right room.The staff from this point on were very helpful, apologetic and friendly, always greeting you with a smile :)The motel grounds are beautifully landscaped and manicured. The rooms were beautiful, romantic and clean. The villa pools are perfect for that after noon or morning dip. The main pool and sun cafe are gorgeous. The spa is also amazing.The american breakfasts are delicious. The motel is so central! fab shopping on the main road, 10min walk to the beach(if you dont get distracted by shops) and you can walk on the main road straight into Kuta (30mins) and to 'ground zero' (bomming site)Not many staff or balanese speak english very well and many a time only 'pretend' to understand you. So when making a specific request for something make yourself very clear and make sure the staff understand. ie we waited 30mins for our bags in our room to be picked up as we had arranged with the staff that afternoon before our departure and no one turned up so we lugged all our stuff up to reception, were late to airport and were not very happy. Just a word of warning, if you intend to hire a scooter DO NOT hire it from the guys accross the road, they are absolute [--] scammers, they will try to rip you off. If you do intend on hiring one here are some tips:1- Check fuel level before hire2-ONLY USE INTERNATIONAL LICENCE, your australian one is no good NO MATTER WHAT they say...they just want your money!3- Insist on change up front if you dont have the exact amt, not later. If problems occur mention police or raise your voice, it will work just fine.", "Date": "Nov 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR485764019", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "shortie77sp"}, {"Content": "Relaxation at the Aston My partner  I recently stayed at the Aston Sun Villas in Seminyak and it was absoluately fantastic.

We stayed for 9 nights and really loved it. We split our trip in two and stayed at the Aston Resort and Spa in Nusa Dua/ Tanjong Benoa first for 7 nights then stayed at the villa's for 9 nights. Would not recommend the Aston Resort and Spa but totally endorse the Aston Sun island Villa's.Location was great, lots of great places to eat close by. Food at the Villa's also great. Service was exceptionally good from the moment we checked in to the time we checked out.The main pool was cool as it played funky music during the day and was a nice place to grab a really good cup of coffee...they a have a really good coffee machine! Was a great place to chill while house keeping cleaned the villa. Breakfast was also good and made fresh to order. It was a welcomed change to boring buffet's. Was also great to get a decent cup of coffee in the morning. The accomodation was excellent. It is only really new, so everything is modern. The bed and pool loungers very comfy.I really enjoyed the experience of staying in a villa. But I did miss being on the beach and having a view of the ocean. I am a big fan of sunset cocktail sessions on my balcony. So I felt that was the only thing lacking from this holiday. The day spa was also bliss.", "Date": "Oct 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR750238497", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mrorganic"}, {"Content": "Absolutly Ideal       The main pool area", "Date": "Oct 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR174272680", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "MrParker001"}, {"Content": "In the vicinity of everything important I had a great stay in Aston Sun Island.
