The staff all spoke excellent English and were very welcoming and helpful. The room was very clean and, although small, quite comfortable. Free wifi was a little weak but generally not a problem. The location, of course, is impossible to beat. We loved our view and it was so convenient to the RER station that goes directly to the airport! A couple tips: - You must climb a long flight of stairs to enter the hotel. If you have a lot of luggage or have difficulty with steps, consider staying elsewhere. The lift from the lobby to the rooms was broken for one day as well, and since there's only one elevator, stairs were the only option. - If you like to stand up in your bathroom and/or not knock your head against the ceiling regularly, don't ask for a room on the sixth floor. We LOVED our room on the sixth floor, but had to figure out how to shower without a stand-up shower (the ceiling is sloped in the bathroom) or shower curtain, which my husband (kind of a big guy) found problematic. Other floors will likely have a similar view but no sloped ceilings. - That said, our room was AMAZING. There was a little loft you accessed with a wooden staircase inside the room, with a skylight in the ceiling that we opened to gaze out onto Notre Dame and the river. It was truly delightful, if a little cramped.

The location is amazing, the staff is friendly and helpful and the hotel itself is cute and charming. When we arrived at the hotel at 9am, the room was ready and we were allowed to check in early which was awesome considering we had just endured a 12 hour direct flight. However we waited for an hour because I requested to be moved to a room with a better view of the Notre Dame Cathedral and that room wasn't quite ready yet. It wasn't a big deal, we just waited in the lobby and had breakfast while they prepared the room for us. About the breakfast...it's 9 euros per person for a baguette, two croissants, coffee and orange juice. At first I thought this was pretty steep for bread, coffee and o.j. so the following day we went out to have breakfast elsewhere and it turns out breakfast is the same in all of Paris. Bread, coffee and oj. This was a little hard for us big American breakfast eaters, but we adapted! After realizing the breakfast situation, we ordered breakfast in our room every morning and ate while we got ready to go out and venture the city. Plus it was a delight having breakfast with the curtains open and admiring the beautiful view of the cathedral and the city from our room. The receptionist during the day was so awesome and helpful. She helped us book dinner and show reservations. She also had a lot of recommendations which were greatly appreciated. The hotel itself is nice. If you're expecting the Ritz Carlton, this isn't the hotel for you. However if you want a feel of what real Paris feels like and want a great central location, stay here. Behind the hotel there's a ton of cute little sidewalk cafes, shops and bars. It was fun just walking around and absorbing the scenery. Make sure to get a room with a view. It's a little extra than a room without a view but so worth it! The view makes this hotel worth the price. The room is small, which is expected from Paris, so having the view definitely helped us from getting claustrophobic. Overall we had a great time! I mean it's Paris for Gods sake!

It is located conveniently on the Seine River just across from Notre Dame Cathedral. The cost is worth the view alone, but be sure to ask for a room with a view on a high floor. You will have to carry your suitcases up one flight of stairs to the reception area. The hotel is situated above stores that are on the street level of a bustling intersection. I think the cafe across the street stays open all night long. My room was small, but had two windows, so it seemed larger when the curtains and windows were open. The tile shower was large. The furnishings in my room were becoming a bit dilapidated...could use some updating and refurbishing. The bed was very comfortable. With the windows closed, the street noise was not too much of a problem. (The location is at a very busy intersection with motorcycles, emergency vehicle sirens, police whistles, etc.) The walls between the rooms are not well insulated, so I heard everything going on in the room next door (Ooo la la!). Guests might also be disturbed by the vacuum cleaner noise and cleaning, which began quite early in the morning. The housekeeper left cleaning equipment and trash in the narrow hallway.

Let's start with something as simple as the safe - it is so low to the floor that you need to get on your knees to read the instructions.

AR there is no door on the shower, and an awkwardly aimed shower head (ours rotated freely and couldn't be tightened in any position) allows the entire bathroom floor to become wet. No soap dish in the shower. A single towel rack (over the toilet) so that there is no place to hang a wet towel. A sink that has a spigot that is far too long, spilling water too close to the front edge, and that is set into a wooden top that is already showing signs of breakage and rot, although the renovation is less than a year old. Not a single place to open even one suitcase. A useless desk, with no hotel info and no TV channel listing. The new flat screens did not appear to be giving an HD picture, at least in our room (#22, which like 32 and 42 has the corner view, to the Seine and bookstalls to the North and an unobstructed view of the Notre Dame to the East.

Right opposite Notre Dame and a short stroll from the Louvre and Bld Saint Germaine. Thats why it can charge 200 Euros for the night. Its about location not the luxury or ambience of the hotel. The hotel, designed by Christian Lacroix is bijoux (small - all of it including your room) and up a set of stairs next to a bar. And on a main road so the traffic noise is deafening at times with the windows open. Or closed. |Revellers enjoyed themselves to the very late early hours of the morning below in the bar and street. But that adds to the ambience and feeling of being in the heart of Paris! That said, it was OK. Shower no bath, and nowhere to put your soap or shampoo when there. A major oversight on behalf of Monsieur Lacroix - but we were told thats how he had designed all the rooms. Minor but irritating - along with the towels gettign wet when you were in the shower as the are stored on the back of the wall in there. The roooms were small. The lounge area was OK, great views were its saving point alongside the hotel was very clean and tidy. The lady on reception was pleasant but we commented probably a little tired of working on reception in the hotel. Responses were pleasant but a bit automated and dismissive - one had to probe to find things out rather than information volunteered- If you dont ask the right question - you will probably miss out on important - or informative - information. Also you HAD to give your key to her if you went out. Very stern about that! On a good point - as I feel I should say something is that when we asked about parking Madame did point out a road where we could park for free. We later found out that all parking is free during August - inthe legitmiate parking spaces that is. Worth knowing! Generally nice clientele. Hotel never busy which was nice. But as we discovered on our second night we could have a fantastic hotel for 70 euro more (August is cheap so book direct with the hotels to get the discount) We booked Notre Dame through Mr and Mrs Smith but L'hotel direct. And instead of it being 400 euro (as on Mr and MRs Smith web) we paid 270 Euro. Go there instead. Its lovely. Brilliant location, decor, service and its quiet and in the heart of things.

The staff was pleasant and spoke English well enough to communicate anything that was necessary. The elevator was tiny and there was only enough room for one person and baggage at a time. The hallways and the room were also very small. However, after traveling through Europe I have come to expect that places are not marked well and rooms are tiny. The room had a great view of the river and Notre Dame. It is directly over a very busy intersection but surprisingly it was pretty quiet with the window closed. However, there ambulance sirens in Europe are very obnoxious and that sound will definitely penetrate even the thickest walls. Fortunately, I'm not a light sleeper so I did not notice any noise. The bed was not the most luxurious but I now realize that is standard in Europe too. The hotel and room were decorated nicely and it was generally a comfortable stay. The location was excellent for our needs because of the proximity to Notre Dame and the Metro station is directly across the street. The Metro was a little intimidating but with a little help and a map from the front desk it was the easiest way to get around Paris and see all the sights. The hotel breakfast was light but substantial enough to get the day jumpstarted right. The hotel also sold bottled water that I could take with me on the town. It probably cost a little more than I could have paid elsewhere but the convenience was more important to me.

We stayed for three nights in the corner room, which was large, with a view of Notre Dame and a bathtub. We liked our stay so much that upon our return from Normandy we booked another room. This room didn't have a bathtub (other rooms with bathtubs were booked), so the room was smaller, but we could lay in bed and view the Cathedral. I didn't give five stars for value considering the current USD to Euro. At the time it was $1.51 per Euro, which meant we were shelling out 50% more to stay here. If you want to spend a little more in order to stay here, I recommend spending the extra for a bathtub and view of Notre Dame. These two insure you are given a larger room. Otherwise, I don't think this hotel would be worth the price. Taking a bath in a very clean room over looking Notre Dame with a glass of wine is about as good as it gets. I think.

I understand that the building is old, but therefore carpets are definitely not an interior decoration material in the present case.

We didn't really know what to expect as neither of us has stayed here previously, nor had any of our friends. Consequently, we had to rely mainly on the location and the reviews here on TripAdvisor. We found the hotel through tablet.com, though, which has a pretty great track-record with me. Regardless, the place was wonderful. There were a few small issues, but I can be kind of picky, and these small complaints were more just my own pet-peeves. The location is unbeatable for Parisian sights. Our room, 31, had an unfettered view of the cathedral and the picturesque traffic intersection below. At night, the lights are beautiful. Plus, it's literally across the street from the RER and Metropolitain station. Or, if you're a walker like I am, there's lots of restaurants and bars (gay and gay-friendly, though) just north, across the Isle de Cite near Hotel de Ville. Or just hop the trains and head to other areas of the city. The building itself if typical of Parisian architectural charm, which I think lends to some of the small complaints I had. The rooms are on the small side, so if you're traveling for an extended period of time with large suitcases, it'd be best to avoid this hotel. Also, there's no elevator from the street level to the lobby. And the elevator from the 1st floor and up is kind of tiny. The rooms are funky and oddly decorated, but in a really great way. For instance, our room has carpet that looks like hardwood flooring. The Renaissance tapestry that is our bed's headboard is quirky - and the bed is VERY comfortable. I can guess most/all of the rooms are likewise kitschy. But it gives a really upbeat and modern feel. However you want to describe it, they pull it off well. The bathroom is small, but very well appointed and functional. If you've ever been to Japan, then you should be fine with this. In the shower, however, the hotel has decided to use a glass partition to keep water in the shower \"area\" instead of doors or a shower curtain. I'm sure this is a space-saving feature. However, the partition is probably 10-15 cm too short, and there was a fair amount of water on the floor after the shower. Not a lot, mind you, but enough that about 1/4 of the bathmat was completely soaked. There was also not a lot of ventilation in the bathroom itself, so steam could be an issue. Finally, and I'm sure these are due to the age of the building, but water pressure was iffy and the temperature was highly susceptible to the toilet-flushings and shower usage of other guests. Neither was a huge problem, but I did get a few jolts of cool water during my shower. But in all, not a huge deal by any means. The location is great, but presents its own set of concerns. The intersection and the view of Notre-Dame are great, but the intersection itself is apparently a hotbed of activity until about 2 am. Thin walls (I presume) and tall windows mean that we could hear a few shouts of good-natured revelry really early in the morning, every morning, as well as sirens from an ambulance/police car or two. Our room came with breakfast and WiFi included. The breakfast is continental and includes pain de chocolate, a baguette, and a croissant for each person. Coffee and orange juice are pretty much automatic. The food was great and the service was quick. Both of us really appreciate the free WiFi, which is so uncommon in American hotels (many of which tout themselves as having 4 or 5 stars) that it's almost ridiculous. Overall, great place.

I would not have picked it out on my own, but now recommend this to others. It appears recently redecorated or something as everything was nice and clean and new looking. It is small feeling especially for someone from USA. Try to bring small sized luggage so it is easy to carry up the stairs to 2nd level where reception is. There is a small elevator from there to all other floors. There is a small breakfast and bar area but we did not try this out due to our one night stay. Our room was on 6th floor facing the canal and had plenty of room but was an interesting loft arrangement where the sleeping area was up a fairly steep and narrow stair case. I think only the 6th floor rooms were like this. These stairs were no problem unless you tried to go to the restroom during the night in the dark. It is a noisy area of town with lots of activity and busy streets...but with the windows shut we had no problems sleeping. Excellent view out the window to see Notre Dame and the canal. Very close to RER B rail stop with elevator access to below street level where train stop is. What I would call the alley behind the building is packed with shops, bars, cafe's, and on the evening we were there had lots of people. I highly recommend the crepes made there in front of you at the end of the alley...can't remember the store name. We were there the day before the various worker strikes at the time really started to take effect so that was the only negative part of our travel was the time it took to travel by train from there to CDG airport (1.5 hours for us)...and the train was packed until we reached the Nord Station and had to switch over...then not so bad. There are plenty of places to eat, gift shop, and the canal tour starting points are within 5-10min walk (at Pont Neuf).

We had a corner room (41), which has a stunning view of Notre Dame and a good part of the Seine. The location is excellent from the standpoint of being close to transportation, restaurants, and sights, not so good from the standpoint of LOUD street noise (horns, sirens, discos) and a gauntlet of tacky souvenir shops occupying most of the sidewalk between it and the RER and metro stations. However, Rue de la Huchette, behind the building, is surprisingly quiet and contains dozens of restaurants with good food, and reasonable prices in many cases. Like other reviewers, we were not happy to be greeted by a narrow and fairly long set of stairs that we had to climb with our luggage. The desk clerk was friendly and efficient, but disappointingly could not provide two (punch card) room keys (when multiple keys are available even in Thimpu, Bhutan!). She did offer the option of a dummy key that would turn on the lights, however. The elevator is good for a maximum of two people, or one person plus luggage. Still, fitting a lift at all into this ancient building must have been a trial. The room had been modernized to the maximum possible extent to provide modern conveniences without destroying the character of the ancient building. The bed was comfortable and featured the best pillows I've found in any hotel. For antiquarians, the view straight up while lying supine on the bed is a trip into the middle ages. Don\u2019t be put off by the uneven floor under the new carpet; it\u2019s been there for hundreds of years and isn\u2019t going to break under you. The completely modernized includes large, fluffy towels and two terrycloth robes. However, the shower has perhaps the worst thought-out design I've ever encountered. There is no ledge or dish for soap, shampoo, etc. -- nowhere to put the stuff except on the shower floor (not a good place!). The door runs only half the length of the shower (usual for Europe). This would not be such a problem, except that the bottom lip of the shower stall is only about 2.5 cm high, so that water runs freely over it and onto the floor. Both problems could and should be fixed easily. The breakfast was not a bad buy, in that it included fresh-squeezed orange juice and excellent breads, but it would have benefited from the addition of a little protein, like cheese or yogurt. Bottom line, this is a good hotel, but next trip to Paris I would be far likelier to stay at another hotel, primarily because of the wide, busy boulevard itself and the tourist junk shops intruding into the sidewalk \u2013 annoyances that did not exist when the building was new.", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "Halkis", "ReviewID": "UR84260437", "Content": "The location is great.

Well, I have to admit, Hotel Notre Dame exceeded my expectations in a good way. We initially booked 1 city view and 1 court view room. Upon arrival, we found the court view room being virtually a dark closet with beds and shower. The staff was glad to show over available rooms. As I stayed there a few years ago I recalled the interesting 2-level room I had up at the top. Those are called duplexes and cost more. We checked them out and selected #63 with the bed upstairs and large open area below. #61 was also good, but another one with the bed on the level below and useless empty lot upstairs didn't look appealing. Overall, the staff had great English, was very friendly; the hotel was clean, quiet (inside); we enjoyed the breakfast there one morning. The downside (somewhat) was the noise on the street. Our other room was on the 2nd floor and it felt there like being in the middle of the all-day/night street party (which our children enjoyed!). The real, critical for some, downside were the steep stairs and tiny elevator. On the evening of the La F\u00eate de la Musique, on the way out my children got stuck in there. None of the alarm/call buttons worked. My daughter had to call us from he cell (which she luckily had with her). The lone hotel staff person said it would take up to 1 hr for someone to show up. That didn't appear possible with the streets around blocked off with the festival's crowd. If you stepped into that elevator you'd get a heart attack from just a thought of being stuck there for longer than 30 sec. My wife made quite an emotional appeal and firefighters were called in, broke the door and got the children out. You'd think the hotel did anything to acknowledge the situation? Nope. The next morning the manager said it was not allowed for children to ride the elevator alone. Yea - 24 y.o.! But, again, the bill was correct and the spirit of being at the heart of Paris - money can't buy. Speaking of money, I agree with others here that the hotel is overpriced. But it is very reliable, and as long as you're lucky to get a good room and stay away from the elevator: you'll simply love it.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cOur new favourite in Paris\u201d", "Author": "2travellingkiwis", "ReviewID": "UR67026778", "Content": "This place is just great! OK, yes you have to walk up 20 steps to get to the reception from the road. It's worth every step!! From check in to check out we had a fantastic 4 days here! We were room 52 (the best room in the hotel, it's the one on the website showing Notre Dame http://www.hotelnotredameparis.com/pages/rooms.html ) Great views of Notre Dame and the Seine river. It's on the 5th Floor, so much less traffic noise than you would get at road level. Fantastic views. Funky decor. Yes it's a cozy room...it's Paris! The shower did go from warm to hot and a step would stop the water going onto the mat...but it wasn't that bad, they serviced the room very well every day and changed the damp mat...problem solved! The staff are so great, especially Julie who organised a Moulin Rouge show for us (I wouldn't reccommend that, but I'm sure there are plenty out there who would!). We had champagne in the lounge (they serve Veuve, not the cheap stuff). It was a great place, great location to main attractions and so many restaurants, very trendy hotel, great price, great staff, and a fantastic way to end our tour of Europe.

They were very helpful at recommending activities and restaurants. The bed was very comfortable and we actually did have a view of Notre Dame from our bed! Despite being on a very busy street, in shouting distance from their high level courthouse, where trials went on most of the day, it was relatively quiet and yet so very close to many attractions. For Europe, the room was large, with ample space to store our giant suitcase. The in-room safe, writing desk, and amenities were a nice touch, as was the organic fragrance used throughout the building. There is no minibar in room, but hotel does provide a bar with limited, somewhat expensive drinks. However, there are many cafes nearby to grab a pastry and coffee.

First of all, I can't think of a better location for someone discovering or visiting Paris. A stone's throw from Notre-Dame and the Seine, a few minutes walk from Saint Germain des Pr\u00e9s and the \"quartier latin\", with its bustling activity and tons of restaurants, bars and theaters, the hotel is located in a small and very quiet street. A big plus! The area is perfectly safe and the train station to the airports is only about 500 metres away.(totally manageable with a rollig suitcase) The hotel is well kept and my room was spotless. There is a big flat screen TV Now the downside: My room (n\u00b0 34) was ridiculously small, even by Parisian standards. I couldn't even walk around the bed. The bathroom, though aiming at modern and sober, with its whirlpool bathtub and integrated changing lighting, was unpractical to say the least. There is not a single hook or railing to hang used towels. The smallish shelf over the wash basin was not designed to accomodate more than a toothbrush and a couple of glasses. There is no curtain on the bathtub, so taking a shower will invariably flood the whole bathroom, including, with some skill, your toilet paper. The matress was excessively firm and there is a plastic sheet under the regular sheet (presumably to protect the matress from any unwanted damages). Quite unpleasant. Price wise, I found my room to be anything but cheap at 170 euros a night. A rate of about 140 euros a night would be more appropriate.

I choose the hotel based on some of the reviews I saw on Tripadvisor, and was not disappointed. Beware the similarly named hotels in Paris - this one is bang opposite Notre Dame cathedral and has tremendous views of it and over the Seine (Petit Pont bridge). We had a standard room, which had some pretty unique decoration - best see the hotel website, one entire wall had some kind of mural on it, but it was nice, a countryside scene, I think. The room wasn't huge, but the facilities were good and clean. Good shower and ensuite facilities, nice flatscreen TV and clock/radio/iDock, which would have come in handy if I had taken my iPod!! The view was fantastic - the room had three windows, on two sides, looking straight out at Notre Dame cathedral. We loved the location, it was right on the river, very easily within a stones throw....and consequently really easy to walk to lots of major attractions like Saint Chapelle, La Conciergie, The Louvre etc. I would say as a result of the great location, it is very busy. Lots of people and traffic right outside the windows, up until late on. However, with double-glazed windows shut and aircon on (it was 26C when we were there) we had no trouble sleeping right through (pounding the streets all day helps too!). However, we did hear other guests in the hotel at times, some with young children. Great atmosphere around the hotel area, lots of young people (students) enjoying the banks of the Seine, chatting, drinking, playing instruments, right through the evening only a short walk from the hotel. We loved this, it was all really, really nice, not noisy/threatening/irritating in any way at all. Amazingly, there was NO litter left anywhere the following morning - the Parisian refuse collection system is to be congratulated as well as the people themselves! The service was great. The front desk (both lady and gent) were very helpful, recommending local restaurants, calling taxis if required, offering room service, and best of all, no problem at all storing our luggage on the day we checked out for as long as we liked. Oh, and also a plus for location, the RER/St. Michel Notre-Dame metro station has an exit across the road, which means if you travel in from CDG airport with cases, you only have to wheel it about 20m across the street! Very handy! The desk was manned at all times, with a secure exit in/out of the hotel. Slightly tricky to find, it is accessed via a small glass door at the RH side of the brasserie below, and is from first floor upwards. We returned around 2am one night and were immediately let back in with no delay. Breakfast was fine, breads, croissants and jam, tea and coffee at 9 euros each. Great cafe across the street also serves bacon, eggs etc., and our breakfast there was a little more at around 12 euros pp. The hotel has a sauna, but we didn't have time to use that...too busy!!
