This hotel had come recommended as second on a list from a friend. The first hotel was fully booked, we checked it out two days before and they couldn't show us a room then. We decided that at 210 euros, we should just take it. Overall, it was ok, but it was still really hot in Venice in the middle of September and the aircon in the room would not go below 20 degrees celcius, which is not cooling at all. We asked reception to look at it during the day we checked in. They did, and left a note in the room saying they were sorry, but it wouldn't go any lower. That evening we asked the reception desk again and they said, why didnt you ask during the day when the maintenance person is here. I said that we had. At 10pm I called the front desk to tell them that it was unbearably hot, and did they have a fan or a ventilator that we could use. The front desk man said that the Italian Government had declared that since it was September, it was no longer summer and that they were not allowed to lower the airconditioning temperature. I had never heard such rubbish in my life, but how do you argue that at 10pm at night over the phone. So we had to sleep with wet towels over our bodies all night, which only helped a little. After a bad night sleep, we awoke to find we had been bitten by mosquitos. Front desk claimed that they could have offered us an anti-mosquito coil, but we already had plugged one in the room. Problem was that we couldn't use it all night coz there was only one working plug socket in the room which we needed to charge our camera battery with. But breakfast was nice and the place was generally very clean. Had good internet connection which we paid for separately for each device. In the morning we discovered that we only needed to pay for the 6 hour internet access as it lasted as long as the 12 hour access code. Oh well, it was on a couple of euros.

My room was very large for one person and it came with some nice extras - including a free minibar and complimentary slippers! I absolutely loved the location - just steps away from the Accademia bridge and vaporetto stop. The neighborhood is very cute and very quiet but it took no time at all to get to Piazza San Marco, where all the action is. There is a nice pizza cafe just down the block and other cute restaurants and gelato places nearby. The only criticism I would have is that the walls are very thin so you need to be careful about having your TV too loud, etc. But that is very normal for a european hotel. On my last day in Venice, I was catching the night train to Paris at 8pm.

The hotel is located about one hundred yards from the Accademia bridge in the Dorsoduro district. ( It actually faces the side wall of the museum.) This gives you the best of both worlds. The Dorsoduro is directly across the Grand Canal from San Marco and is less \"touristy\" than San Marco. However, the Accademia bridge allows direct access to the sights (and crowds) across the Grand Canal. The hotel itself was fairly typical of small European hotels with rooms of varying sizes and shapes. The interior was clean, but could use some \"freshening\".

Our room was on the first floor overlooking the street, but was quiet at night. The room was rather small, but comfortable. The included Breakfast was a bit mean: 1 roll, 1 croissant and coffee: for the price they could maybe be a bit more generous, but then Venice is an expensive place to stay. Hence the neutral/average rating, but really this is an OK place. The airport vaporetto drops you at Zattere, just at the bottom of the street, and in the other direction you have the Accademia vaporetto stop, so getting round is easy.

What follows is pretty much a stream of consciousness brain-dump...I'm making no attempt to organize my thoughts :) The hotel includes a restaurant, \"bar\", and two \"lounge\" areas (One right off the restaurant which I think doubles as the bar, and one on the 2nd floor which acts more as a library). Common areas were small, but well maintained -- as was our room, #118. This room faced out onto a small courtyard and had an unexceptional view. From what I read elsewhere, all rooms are about the same size and of the same quality except for #119, which is extremely dark and should be avoided. Service at the hotel was good -- the staff was friendly and most spoke some English. During our stay my wife managed to catch a 48-hour stomach flu of some sort, and the front desk was able to get a doctor for us on short notice. Also, on our last day, we encountered Venice's well-known \"Aqua Alta\": Water was up to right below the knee on the streets, and the hotel's lobby and restaurant had 3-4 inches of water in them. The hotel served everyone breakfast in their rooms and lent us Wellies so we could (try to) stay dry while getting our bags out to a waiting water taxi. In my opinion, the Alboretti's location and relatively low price (for Venice anyway -- 130 Euros/night), were its main selling points. While a stone's throw away from the Accademia, the area around the hotel didn't seem overrun by tourists like us. There were two relatively inexpensive trattorias nearby and an Internet cafe just over the Accademia Bridge in Campo San Stefano. You'll find a Vaparetto stop right in front of the Accademia for the days you don't feel like walking to where you need to go. You can walk 5 minutes west, and you'll find yourself in what appeared to be as much of a \"local\" area of town as you can get, populated by students. So to sum things up -- Room - Average: Small, but clean. Service - Good: Helpful, if not a touch disorganized...but what do you expect in Italia?
