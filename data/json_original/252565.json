It is important to keep in mind that the Palazzo Priuli is a small hotel and the rooms differ in size and comfort. We had booked a \"superior room\", we were travelling \"out-of season\" and we were very pleased with the accommodation we had. Persons booking a standard room or a room at the Casa Priuli might not benefit from the same level of comfort. The location of the Palazzo Priuli suited us perfectly.

It puts you close to everything you want to see while at the same time avoiding the masses. This made for a quiet night after a full day of walking all over Venezia. Once you head up the stairs to your room, it is clear how much history the Palazzo Priuli has. The Stairs and stone floors are uneven with frequent slopes in elevation. This adds to the authenticity of the Palace. The ceiling displays the wood beam construction method used in the period. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor also gives the impression that you have stepped back in time 600 years and you are staying as a guest with the Priuli family in their Palace. There is a strange smell everywhere in the building, perhaps from the age. It was not offensive, just strange. We stayed in the first suite right up the stairs that is listed as a Quad. When we checked in, they had two other beds made up in front of the fire place. The bed felt as though it came out of the 16th century. It was as hard as stone. The lobby staff was pleasant but they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put much effort into going beyond pleasant. The breakfast staff and bell hop put much more effort into ensuring absolute satisfaction. If you are looking for a Quad room in Venice, the Palazzo Priuli will do the job. It is hard to find Quad rooms in Venice so if I needed a Quad room, I might book it again.

The weather was perfect and the crowds (it was bank holiday weekend) as expected. On a sunny day, the whole place shimmers with a special quality unique to its watery surroundings. The only negative is the locals, especially those running the restaurants, they all seem so miserable and uninterested. Plus, the younger gondaliers are ruining the traditional gondola image with cigarettes in hand and mobile phones glued to their ears. To me, it all suggests complacency - why bother if the conveyor belt bringing tourists never seems to end. My recommendation is visit some of the other islands by waterbus, they are quieter and you get a more friendly welcome.

There was a small hallway with large closet that connected to the bathroom which was new and very clean with a window that overlooked a courtyard. We had a dresser of 4 drawers in our room plus the closet so clothing space was fine. One thing... they could really use a shelving unit or something in the bathroom- there's absolutely nowhere to put toiletries, which was quite annoying. Other features: well stocked fairly cheap mini bar, small television with cable, queensize heavy wooden bed and lovely furnishings. Breakfast was standard euro breakfast fare. It was fine. Mostly we just drank cappuchinos and had some bread and headed out to sightsee in Venice. The location is amazing. Our friends from Treviso recommended the area around Priuli specifically. They said it was the \"grandparents\" area, which was very quiet but close to the excitement. It was totally true. It was perfect and we are a couple of thirtysomethings. It wasn't hard to find for us at all- it's quite easy, just look at the map.

We spent four nights here celebrating our Silver Wedding anniversary last September. Although it took us a while to find the hotel initially, we were very pleased when we did, it looks stunning and is down a quiet backwater away from the tourist areas. The reception staff were very efficient and spoke perfect English. We had a ground floor room just off reception which we thought at first may be noisy, but it wasn't. Our window looked out onto the front canal and in the mornings with the windows opened we could hear the excited chatter of Italian children walking to school opposite, a taste of the real Italy. Breakfast was served on the first floor, up a marble staircase which has slightly shifted over the years and has a quirky slope at the top - it just made everything very authentic. The food was freshly laid out and there was a good selection for a continental breakfast. Although the hotel is situatied a few minutes from St Marks square, to us this was preferable to being on the over populated tourist streets which seemed very loud at all hours, especially with the shops being open until late into the evening. On our actual anniversary we had a gondolier take us from the hotel to our restaurant on the edge of the lagoon, he serenaded us along the way and it was just a magical experience - apart from when he hummed what seemed to be the Crazy Frog, which was quite amusing! We booked our stay through airmiles, and everything went without a hitch. We would definitely stay here again. The weather in September was warm but not too hot, and we didn't have any rain or flooding which sometimes happens in St Mark's square in the winter months.

I had researched comments made, on tripadvisor, for all 4* hotels within easy reach of St Marc's Square and found a few that had excellent overall reviews. I was also looking at price so the Priuli came out on all top. We were dropped at the end of the canal and only found the hotel by chance as I nearly tripped over the door mat. Many buildings are difficult to find as they don't have any outside signage. The hotel is an historical Venetian buildings with original fittings and lovely chandeliers. The room we had, 106 was exactly like the photos, as small double room. As it was on the side canal, which in narrow, the opposite buildings were quite near which made the room quite dark. This was not a problem as were not in the room much and the evening were dark. In the summer it would probably be a bonus and be cool. It had good storage, lots of hangers. Clean crisp bedding (bed was very hard). Beautiful bathroom with clean linen and adequate toiletries. Take a kettle if you want to make a drink, there is a mini bar fridge. The staff speak excellent English and were very helpful in everything we aked them. Breakfast was excellent, fresh and lots of choice. Although don't expect a full English. The hotel is 3 minutes from the water bus stop, 5 minutes from St Marc's Square and from there it is easy to get anywhere. Be prepared for lots of walking. The only thing I would like to point out is that don't expect usual 4* hotel. There is a small area that has newspapers and 2 comfy sofas but is is not really like the lounge are expected. There is no bar or outside area. However it is beautyfully kept with all the history icludedand not the price of the Bauer etc. On arrival we took a water taxi from the airport (100 Euros) as recommended by friends who had been before, who stayed near Rialto Bridge. Although it was quick, unless you can find someone to share the cost (ask at the landing stage, lots of people were waiting for the water bus and may have shared the cost of the taxi as it holds about 12 people), I wouldn't bother again as The Priuli is situated before you get to St Marc's Square and the Grand Canal so you don't get to see the sights. You could ask the taxi driver to take you on a round trip before dropping you at the hotel .
