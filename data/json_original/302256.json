The reason I stay here is that it is a good all rounder. The location is great in the heart of Wanchai, its opposite some good pubs/bars so if nightlife is your thing you couldn't stay in a better location. Despite this I have never been disturbed by noise from the street apart from when the rugby 7s is on which unless you are there for the rugby I advise you to avoid Hong Kong at this time. There are numerous convenience stores within a 2 minute walk also kebab, pizza, Thai and subway takeaways again less than 2 minutes walk away. At the end of the street (50 meters) there is a \"pacific coffee\" which is a starbucks style coffee shop which is great for morning coffee and croissant.Dont be put off by wanchais reputation as a red light district its hardly noticeable unless you go looking for it and very tame (look out for ladyboys outside 7/11 after midnight ) The rooms as in most of Hong Kong are quite small but functional on my last stay we were on the 17th floor and seemed like the room had been renovated it was in good condition and clean but I cannot vouch for all floors as I have had rooms in the past with stained carpets but possibly the whole hotel has been renovated. We are a family of three and there is space in a double room for an extra bed which the hotel will happily provide . Didn't get charged for the extra bed on my last visit but have in the past in fact as we were checking out there were some Irish ladies complaining about the fee for the extra bed so a bit hit and miss. Getting to the hotel is simple from the airport. Catch the airport express from the airport to hong Kong station in 25minutes cost HK$100. Catch a taxi from station to the hotel in less than 10 minutes and cost less than HK$30. The MTR station is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel great for getting around Hong Kong. If fashion shopping is your thing then Wanchai doesn't have much to offer but does have a decent street market which is worth a visit and the wanchai computer center above the mtr station and 24hr mcdonalds is great for geeks(sorry) My only negatives about the wharney are that the room service menu is very limited to Asian dishes and expensive but as mentioned there plenty of places to eat on your doorstep from traditional pub grub to delicious thai restaurants. Also the tv choice for english speakers is limited to Sky news,cnn and national geographic channel. recommend this hotel and can be had at a good price most of the year through BA.com", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Asia", "Title": "\u201cconvenient location but thin walls\u201d", "Author": "pte-traveller", "ReviewID": "UR137046349", "Content": "Convenient location with lots of eateries, popular wanton noodle shop, egg tarts shop and convenience stores just minutes away.

However, as this hotel caters mainly to tourist with kids, we were frequently disturbed by the hotel guest shouting at each other across the rooms.

We go back from time to time to visit friends. We like to stay in the Wanchai area because that was our old stomping ground and we know the area well. This year we stayed at the Wharney for several reasons: 1. Good location. 2. Most reasonably priced mid-range hotel for the dates we would be in town. 3. We had stayed there before and found it very nice. We were not disappointed this year. Our stay was from August 7th to 9th (2 nights). We were in room 1821. We paid for a \"standard\" room but were assigned a room on an executive floor. We requested and received a non-smoking room. One bed, also as requested. There had been some comments regarding free Internet. Our reservation through ORBITZ clearly indicated free internet. This was honored by the hotel. WIFI speed in our room was excellent. The room size is relatively large for Hong Kong. Bed, desk, lounge chair left sufficient room for our luggage. Closet space is acceptable for a short stay for a couple. In room safe nice to have. Mini-fridge (very mini). We took out the soft drinks and other items and were able to put in 3 oranges and 3 pears. That was about it. They supply two bottles of water (380 ml) per day of our stay. Nice touch. (Be careful-the water bottles in the mini-fridge are chargeable. The ones on the night table are free.) Bathroom is small. The wall to the room is glass (see through) but there is a curtain that comes down from the inside for privacy. Toiletries including toothbrush, razor, soap, etc. are supplied. Nice touch. Flat screen TV. Limited English language choices. Many restaurants, fast food, 7-11 stores, banks, etc. in the area. Short walk to MTR (subway) station. There are lots of \"girly\" bars in the area but that does not bother my wife or myself. Just \"walk on by\" if you are not interested. Pool and gym available. We did not use so I cannot comment. Front desk staff very friendly. We took the AIRPORT EXPRESS bus from the airport to Central. Then took the A1 free shuttle from the train station. It stops right in front of the hotel. Did the reverse returning to the airport. Shuttle bus runs every 20 minutes (or so) most of the day. Check schedule if your flight is very late or very early. Overall we would highly recommend this hotel.

The location is fantastic: in the middle of Wanchai, walking distance to the next subway stations, major business areas are not too far away and in the heart of the nightlife district. The reception team is doing their job quick and efficiently despite a small lack of hospitality attitude. During my stay the daily room rates changed due to the hotel\u00b4s revenue management policies. I paid between HKD 900 and 1400 per night. The concierge/bell service was perfect: helpful and prompt. I stayed in room 1319 which was good and quiet. The rooms in Hong Kong hotels are generally speaking much smaller than in mainland China but it was fine. The housekeeping did their job well. Wireless internet was for free and the connection was fast. Breakfast was not included in my room rate. There is an option to have it for HKD 98 per person. The buffet is nice but not outstanding in terms of quality and quantity. The hotel has an outdoor pool and gym which are situated in the neighbouring building and are nice but not top of the range. I can recommend this hotel to all travellers who want to stay a bit away from the classic American and European hotel brands but still have some expectations.

It is also close to wanchai subway station and close to central. The room themselves are okay, bed are a little hard even by Hong Kong standard but room are large and always clean. This is one of the few Hotel in Hong Kong where I never had one word to say against cleanliness. The problem with this hotel is that its price varies alot and sometimes it just get to pricy for what you get. This is a nice clean hotel, but still as mentioned beds are hard, decoration is dated a little so over USD 125 per night I wouldn't go for it. My last visit was a deception since I had book the executive suite and when I went there I was told they only had two single beds. I asked if I could get large bed in deluxe room and get some kind of refund and was told no. I asked if I could cancel booking and was told no. I understand sometimes you can get only twin bed in a regular room, but seriously if you book an executive suite you expect to get a large bed.

I was on the fifth floor, and there was some street noise audible from there, but that kind of thing doesn't bother me - though you may wish to request a higher floor if you're a light sleeper - they did give me the option. Service at the hotel was generally pretty unfriendly otherwise though. The rooms themselves are pretty sparse in terms of features, but look like they have been recently refurbished. Mostly only channels of Asian interest on the TV as well - a reflection that this hotel seems to generally cater to an Asian clientele. Pretty much never turned the TV on again after having an initial glance. Bathroom was a little old, but fine. One thing of note - the beds are very hard, especially for Western tastes. They were actually pretty ok to sleep on, but not the sort of bed you could just throw yourself on to and relax. Again, very good value for money, but the kind of hotel that doesn't really make you want to spend any more time in it than you have to.

The room was clean but being that it was actually cold a heater would have been nice! They claim to have heating in all rooms but believe me that heating system would not have melted ice. I ended up having to buy hot water bottles as it was sooo cold. The shower was almost impossible to regualate too. A 5 minutes shower would take 30 mins just to get the water right. Infact it was so hard to regulate that it was a little dangerous to shower as scolding was a regular occurance. The water pressure however is quite good and the towel are a good size. My room was on the 18th floor on the opposite side to Lockhart Road. Let me tell you I think it was louder on that side than the room I had last time which was on a lower floor and on the street. Maybe I wasn't as tired this trip so noticed the loud music playing and noice so much more. I would lay in bed and hear the breaking of bottles and music playing a 4am....... There is a great Irish bar in the basement called the Cannyman Bar. There is a great little 2 man band playing on Friday nights, which ends up being an open mic night (karaoke).

The room itself was of decent size and had a kingsize bed. The interior looks perhaps a little dated, but you have everything you need there.

The area may look bland during daytime, but after dark it comes alive and can be quite intimidating for first time visitors to Hong Kong. The area is full of friendly bars, some of them with even more friendly female clientele. Although there are many places to go for a beer without getting accosted by the ladies of the night, I wouldn't recommend for anyone on a family break to stay in Wan Chai. Pay a bit more and stay in Central, or stay in Kowloon. If you're looking for something fairly cheap and cheerful, and don't mind staying in a lively area, then The Wharney is an ok choice.

I find Wanchai centrally located in between the business districts of Admiralty/Central and the perpetually overcrowded Causeway Bay shopping district. In short, Wharney Hotel is in very conveniently located for business or pleasure travellers, though it is tucked amidst seedy night clubs. If you've impressionable kids travelling with you, then Wharney Hotel may not be suitable. Our room (#1207) was tiny but kept spotlessly clean and well equipped with hairdryer, kettle, bar fridge (empty for you to stock your own refreshments), with towels, coffee/tea and locally bottled drinking water replenished daily. The beds are a little hard but it is not so bad that you can't adjust to it after a night or two. Sleep quality depends on the room you're assigned. We didn't have any problem with street noise in bustling Wanchai, though we could faintly discern a pub brawl going on in the wee hours of Friday night/Saturday morning. What I like best is the blast from the rain shower in the really tiny bathroom. The tub is clean but somewhat redundant because bath salts and foam bath are not supplied. There is a wall-mounted, multi-purpose liquid soap dispenser, so be prepared to bring or buy your own toiletries if you're fussy. Ditto for razor/shaver. If you need to do your own ironing, be prepared to wait for the equipment to be sent up to your room. Wharney Hotel is easily accessible from/to airport via the affordable Cityflyer (double decker airbus) at HKD40 for a one-way trip, vis-a-vis HKD100 for the Airport Express. Except during rush hours on weekdays, the Airport Express train is not much faster than the Cityflyer because one needs to transfer to a shuttle service from the express train terminus in Central District to reach Wharney Hotel in Wanchai. MTR and the cheap but slow tram are just steps away, as is the bus stop; it is easy to flag down a metered taxi too. In short, you've plenty of transport options; likewise for F&B options. There are plenty of affordable eateries and pubs around the hotel so you're literally spoilt for choice. There is a casual al fresco Chinese eatery 'Hays' just across the street from the hotel which operates 24/7 which serves excellent roast duck, crackling pork and barbequed pork with al dente egg noodles which are perfect anytime one feels peckish. In sum, I would recommend the Wharney Hotel on Hong Kong Island, which is affordably priced when there are no trade events at the Wanchai Convention Centre in its vicinity. In other words, you can get a good rate if you're not visiting Hong Kong in April, Sept, Oct and during the Rugby Sevens (last weekend in March). The Hotel runs a weekend shuttle to Causeway Bay; there is an on-site registration counter and a shuttle to the Wanchai Convention Centre when there are trade shows going on.

Didn't have hot water on arrival, reported it to the desk and was up and running by the time I had got back in the room after a night out. I did pay for breakfast but next time I wouldn't bother as there are a lot of bars and a couple of 7 elevens across the road and around the corner form the hotel also with a McDonalds 100 metres away. Staff in the hotel are very effecient so no complaints. Yes there are lots of bars around this location with girls who dance or whatever they do sitting outside and they do keep asking you to go in but a polite no does the job. Tip when you arrive at HKG airport is get a return ticket on the airport express train which is located inside the terminal just a short walk away from the arrivals area. You buy your ticket to Hong Kong Central just after you collect your cases at HKG$180 which includes free return bus shuttle from the station, which runs about every twenty mins, and drops you off right outside the hotel.

I stayed in an upgraded room giving me access to a lounge area on the 19th Floor with continental breakfast. First off, the rooms are comfortable having king size beds and a nice size for Hong Kong. They did not feel small which can be a problem in HK. The room had Internet (for a fee $120 HK/day) that worked well. The advertised lounge on the 19th floor was a joke. It was a small room 4 tables, a computer to use internet and some small food items left out. The 'lounge' looked like an afterthought in that they had an extra hotel room or storage room and they modified to serve as a lounge. Not worth the upgrade for th lounge. Do the upgrade for the room but not for the lounge access.

The staff were helpful and concerned and it was eventually discovered behind the bar where one of the bar staff had deposited it for safe keeping. This bar was generally very good - excellent staff and good food. The downside was that it could get very noisy especially on Friday nights with the biggest culprits being British expats trying to prove how brilliant they are - but, apart from that it was a good place to unwind.

Always asked after us everyday we saw him. Some guests complained that staff was unfriendly, but we never found that, but its a 2-way thing - if your friendly they're friendly. One girl didnt understand English but she promptly asked her colleague to serve us who did. Rooms are like good 3* or low 4* european hotels. Smelt musty on first day but after that - no more smells. Beds were so hard when we first sat on them but when you sleep on them they were actually really comfortable. Really clean as I am quite sensitive and can feel bed mites - but no probs. Could see carpet stained where someone spilt a drink but you get disposable slippers so no probs. One funny thing was that my 6ft fiance didnt fit into the bath and when he stood up for the shower, had to bend his neck to wash his head. Good facilities, they even give you free toothbrushes, so one less thing to bring. Brilliant location, 2 mins from MTR, 5 mins from trams, 10 mins from ferry. Close to Wellcome supermarket for your bits. Only problem is that the bars on that road pump up the music on Thurs-Sat and even tho we were on the 19th floor we heard the music and screaming. Guess doesnt help that its rugby week - so not much sleep those few days! So joined in next day instead. Some reviews stated that the red night district bothered them, but we thought it was great, brilliant atmosphere not sleazy like France. Wouldn't feel intimidated if i walked there on my own more intimidated by the drunk tourists! Bad experience at American Peking restaurant. We walked in when closing but they asked us to go in, then many dishes we wanted werent avail. cos take too long to cook, so ordered other stuff. Then while we ate a waiter stood over us constantly looking at his watch, then the bill came and was extortionate! So got ripped off on an unpleasant meal! Not happy! Loved the Hay Hay restaurant tho, highly recommend the deep fried pigeon. So nice we went back on our last nite for that. If you're screamish ask them to leave the head out. Its detached but on the plate for deco. I know some ppl find that off putting. Also liked the garlic Gai Lan (greens), fruit punch, sweet and sour garoupa (fish).

One staff member consistently went out of his way to help us (getting taxis, asking how we were, etc) & definately added so much to the hotel. We also left for 5 days to go to Thailand and were able to leave some luggage in the hotel free of charge. Throughout our stay the staff were incredibly helpful & when we arrived back from Thailand the hotel was full & we were put in a smaller room without a safe. I called to ask to change rooms & they said the next day when another was available they would do this for us. We arrived back the next night to a much bigger room! Our friend had a pretty horrible room on his return, but did not complain or ask to change, so I wouldn't put this as a negative as when we asked they were polite & apologetic. A few people on here have commented on the bad views, but as the previous reviewer said, you have to expect that in HK (unless you book a luxiourious hotel). Personally I loved looking out our window onto the bustle of Lockhart Road. Nearby is the MTR, buses, loads of restaraunts, bars, Wan Chai market, outlet shops. The bar downstairs \"the Canny Man\" is really relaxed and friendly (a Whiskey Bar my father used to frequent!) & you get a 10% discount if you are in the hotel - a nice getaway in the middle of WanChai. The area itself is great to walk around to get a nice mix of different aspects of HK (pick up a tourist map at the airport - so handy - we always had them at home, a free A-Z! The Wharney is also on there) No breakfast was included in our deal, but if you fancy a big English/American breakfast the building next door, 3rd floor, is a 24 hour (cheap) place called \"the flying pan\". Definately recommend. The American Restaurant (is actually Chinese food)(come out of the hotel & turn right- across the road) is famous for it's Peking Duck. We didn't use the swimming pool, but saw it & it looked very nice with outdoor jacuzzi! (Possibly not the most family friendly hotel due to the location as someone mentioned on here - right in the centre of Wan Chai which is known for strip bars - however when I was a child in HK I never really noticed them, so maybe through innocent eyes it doesn't actually matter!

Having read a couple of the reviews here before making my journey to HK, I didn't want to expect big things from this hotel (for starters, the name of the hotel doesn't make it sound like its a great hotel). We were initially planning to stay at the Novotel nearby, but it was fully booked so this was a cheaper option we took up, and on the map it's got really good location so we decided to make a reservation at the Wharney. I always think that how the hotel lobby looks would roughly give you an idea of how the room will be like. (although, I have been fooled on occasions). Walking into the lobby at Wharney Hotel, it was clean, well-lit, not too overly decorated, and well managed. Already I had a good impression. The rooms were small, (but every hotel in HK has really small rooms). They were clean, tidy. Bed was a bit hard, but it was alright. After a long day of shopping, you'd be so exhausted that the last thing you'd notice is the hard bed. They provide you with TV with satellite channels, and there's also wireless internet connection if you decide to bring your laptop along. The greatest thing about this hotel however, is the fantastic location. Only a stone's throw away from the Wanchai MTR station, you're only minutes away from the main shopping areas. The night life around the hotel is good too, with many pubs, and food stalls you can go to even at late hours of the night. One downside to this is there are quite a bit of prostitutes and strip bars around the area, and if you're a single man they do tend to bother you while you walk past them. Having said that, they don't post that much disturbance for it to be an inconvenience to you. If you're in a group, or with your girlfriend/wife, then chances are they'll leave you alone.

The MTR is a few minutes walk away, as is a branch of the China Travel Service should you need a Chinese Visa in a hurry. The taxi to both Star Ferry terminals (at Wanchai and Central) is around HK$15, and the Wanchai terminal can be walked to above ground. Taxi to Peak tram was around HK$20. We requested non-smoking rooms, which we had on both stays. Well done! Regarding eating, once again the hotel has excellent local facilities. Having read the reviews we did not eat at the hotel, but rather took our chance locally. There are two excellent restaurants nearby: Jo Jo\u2019s Mess (Indian) located above the Bottoms Up bar, and our favourite, the Chili Club. Pacific Place is also good, and there are plenty of good local places as well. The hotel has three 7-11 stores within 100 yards, which is great for that soft drink and quick snack. Also there is Starbucks around the corner for that caffeine fix! During our second stay we were positioned on the 15th floor, where the refurbished rooms were better than the 12th. Rooms were typically HK: small yet functional. Rooms had a mini-bar and coffee making facilities, and whilst the towels were a bit \u2018thin\u2019 they were clean. Room were cleaned daily and the bell hops were very attentive. The staff at reception tried their hardest at English, and as is usual in this part of the world, a smile and a gentle request is better received than a raised voice. We had a couple of hours by the pool which was adequate, but slightly strange being surrounded by 20+ storey buildings! On the downside, the hotel\u2019s surroundings can be noisy (open bars playing late night music), although being on the 12 and 15 floors, this did not bother us. Breakfast was not expensive at HK$99, but there are plenty of places around the hotel where you will pay up to HK$25 for something reasonable. And finally, the nightmare that was \u2018waiting for lifts\u2019! Three lifts: not funny. It was not unusual to wait for 5 minutes for an empty lift, at any time of the day (or night). The hotel needs to get this sorted. In summary, given what we paid (we booked through BA), I have no complaints and would stay again at the Wharney.

I would imagine some of the front facing rooms could be noisy was well, as the road is very busy with traffic and clubs/bars. The basement bar was like a British pub with TV screens which was handy during the football World Cup. The pool was adequate but quite cold (this was in June) and only worth a quick dip. The spa pool was even colder! The location is great if you like the pubs and clubs and dont mind being grabbed by hookers as soon as you walk out the hotel. Some people would describe the location as seedy but I had my family with me and it didnt bother us. There are loads of bars/clubs,shops and restaurants in the immediate vicinity set amongst the \"ladies\" bars -each of which has several Filipino women hanging outside trying to tempt you in.

Some clarification needed though because I wouldn't recommend it for a family stay but for singles, younger couples and especially guys, its pretty hard to beat for value and location. Yes, some of the rooms need a refurb but they're getting round to doing them and if your not happy with what they give you they'll normally change without much fuss. Breakfast is good, but now there's a breakfast club next door (3rd floor) serving 24hr breakfasts so no need to rush down to the hotel restaurant! I've not patronised the Canny Man, but with so many good bars in and around the hotel there's not much point drinking in a downstairs hotel bar when you can sit and watch the world go by in a heap of other bars. Hostess clubs next to the hotel are a bit off putting at first but once they realise that you either a 'goer' or a 'no-goer' they'll either leave you alone or be your best friend. All pretty harmless really and nothing much to see, unless you like looking at curtains! Great bars close by, too many to mention and lots of good, inexpensive eating places. You can spend a fortune on food in HK, but plenty of good value eateries in Wanchai. Also, hotel is ideally located for MTR, buses, trams, convention centre, ferries, etc. Great shopping too...discount clothes shops, electrical discount centres, mobiles, everything close at hand. Pacific Place (shopping, eating, cinema) is only a short walk away too.", "Date": "May 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cis this the worst 4* (worst hotel?) in Asia ?\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5149244", "Content": "Damp sheets, bad air conditioning, noisy (as if you are sitting in the middle of a football match), smelly room.

As described in other reviews, the rooms aren't huge, and could certainly do with an update. However, they are clean and look like most other hotel rooms the world over. We got a deal through STA Travel for the double room for 4 nights for \u00a3200, so as far as value goes the Wharney has to score quite highly. We didn't use any other facilities, we planned to use the pool, but it's closed for 5 months over winter (not mentioned anywhere before booking). Again, this has been covered before, but do be aware that you're staying in Wan Chai, and that the hotel is in the heart of the hostess club district. This isn't at all noticable when you're in the room, but as soon as you're outside it's pretty in-your-face. It's a shame as there are a good few bars on Lockhart Rd too, but if you sit outside for too long the seedier side of Wan Chai begins to surface. It's not as intimidating as other cities perhaps, but just do be aware. Overall, the hotel is good value, is located centrally on Hong Kong island, and the staff are pretty helpful. Don't expect any glitz and glamour, or much space in your room, but the hotel does what it says on the tin!", "Date": "February 15, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Wharney Guang Dong Hotel Hong Kong", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d302256-Reviews-The_Wharney_Guang_Dong_Hotel_Hong_Kong-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$119 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.57-73 Lockhart Road, Wanchai Bay</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "302256", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/28/31/55/wharney-guang-dong-hotel.jpg"}}
