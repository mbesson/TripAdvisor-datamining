{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Perfect Hotel This hotel was great. The location couldn't be better, walking distance from all the sites, and in Florence that's a super bonus. You can see the Duomo from the bedroom window! The hotel was clean, lots of towels and supplies, a fridge and the AC worked just fine. The staff is very friendly, and always willing to help. We have teenage children and they didn't have any complaints, for the amount of time you spend in your room it's not worth paying the price of a 5 star. We would surely return to this hotel in the the future.", "Date": "Sep 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR373454571", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Bartolillos"}, {"Content": "Enjoyed the Costatini I knew from the beginning that this was a simple and basic hotel, and that is accurate in every respect. However, we spend so little time in our room that paying for 4-star luxury would be a waste of money. If you expect luxury, then this is not for you. But if very clean, well-maintained, friendly staff/owners, and comfortable are high on your list, then Costantini serves very well. The bed was comfortable. I saw no threadbare linens as in earlier reviews. The bathroom was large and modern with a hairdryer and fluffy, plush terrycloth bath towels (a rarity in Italy at the 2 or 3 star category). And the location at any price cannot be beat--literally steps from the Duomo at the heart of Florence. Breakfast in their frescoed breakfast room was just enough, but nothing to get excited about (typical for Italy, though). FYI--I am a travel agent and I chose this for myself based on location and budget, but I would not hesitate to place clients here who know what to expect and don't need or want an Americanized experience.", "Date": "Jun 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR107119460", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "buddyrdh"}, {"Content": "Loved this little hotel in Florence! We spent 3 nights at this wonderful 2-star hotel in Florence, Italy. We stayed in one of the rooms in the back and it was great.

Not romantic. Clean, safe, convenient The elevator does work-ust pull the little door open after you push the button and wait. Don't climb the stairs with 2 heavy bags like we did because it is more than 2 floors, technically speaking. When we first walked into our room, the simplicity took a bit of getting used to but overall we had a fine stay. I don't recommend the room for a honeymoon or romantic inspiration. The room is simple, not a picture on the wall but the room was clean. Our AC worked as long as we had the windows closed. This is the only hotel during our 12 day tour of Italy that had free internet on a new computer!!! Our bathroom had definitely been recently remodeled and it had a working hairdryer. We had a pretty painted ceiling. The bedding was a plain green bedspread. Everything worked. We had a cute view of the streets and the terrace below us. We felt safe. The staff understood most of what we said and they were helpful and kind. The breakfast is basic but has cereal, great yogurt, fresh coffee, some bread and juice. You really can't beat the location, close to it all. The price is great too. (It's less than the nasty Hotel Martelli (see my other review) .) Ponte Vecchio bridge is about a 10 minute walk to the right. Duomo is at your door. Straw markets are about 10-14 minute walk. Festival Gelato right near by. We told the morning man about how we thought the cab driver overcharged us and he was honestly upset for us  wanted to file a report and everything, very protective. Go to il Pizzauolo for the best pizza I've ever had in my life. Still want it. In summary, the hotel is basic. It's clean. It's simple, very simple but safe and we sure enough wished we were there instead of the rotten Hotel Martelli on our last night.", "Date": "Jun 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR582694060", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "HonestlyNC"}, {"Content": "Very basic hotel in excellent location This hotel is barely a one-star.

Great bed, hot water, great breakfast but only drawback was that the bell tower gave me a wake up call at 7am each morning and since I had been travelling fairly extensively I was exhausted and just wanted to a have a sleep in.

Our balcony had a drop-dead gorgeous view of the Duomo's facade. This hotel is in the middle of everything Florence has to offer; not more than a 15 minute walk from every attraction. I stayed in Florence a few years ago, near Piazza San Marino, which is about a 20 minute walk from the center and Duomo, and having stayed in the very center, I think it's a much better decision. You're in the middle of things; lots of people; tons of restaurants; a joyous atmosphere. The hotel is located in an 11th century building! The proprietor speaks fluent English. Nice breakfast -- coffee is brewed to order! We paid about Euro100 per night, which is a great deal.Con#1: very very loud, especially on Friday-Saturday nights. I keep the window open, and the noise from the outside (people, street cleaning, etc) was deafening. I had to wear ear plugs. For people who don't mind sleeping with the closed window, it's not that big of a problem.Con#2: the rooms are tiny. Basically, two people cannot pass each other.
