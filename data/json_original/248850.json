Location, well depends on where you need to be in the city really. From Schoenefeld Airport, it takes ages to get to (nearest S-Bahn Station would be Savignyplatz) Nearest U-Bahn Stations are a 10 min walk away (Adenauerplatz U7 or Uhlandstrasse U1) and hotel is off the Kurfurstendamn. For those coming from Tegel Airport, Bus 109 stops nearby. Handy for the Western half of the city, Zoologischer Garten, Kadewe, Kurfurstendamn, Nollendorf Platz, but a trek for anything else east of this. Citadines itself is a hybrid of hotel and serviced apartment.Was allocated a room on the 7th floor which was of a reasonable size at least 30 square metres with a seperate kitchen area. Everything is provided in the kitchen, even down to the number of bin liners, so stock up the fridge and away you go. Bathroom is only equiped with shower gel and soap for the 1st night, as you will need to buy these and towels are only changed once a week if staying that length of time as the whole apartment is cleaned once a week. The room had a sofa bed which according to the other reviews on here created no end of issues. Personally speaking, I found it comfortable to sleep on and had no problem what so ever, the mattress was firm and so were the pillows. Room has free internet access but alas no free wi-fi which is only available in the lobby area from a free 24 hour ticket. One suggestion would be to extend this very valuable facility to the whole of the building. You also need to empty your own rubbish (unless it is a cleaning day) and the rubbish chute is located in the basement along with the parking lot and the laundrette. Staff are friendly and in all was quite happy to stay here and would return, especially If I managed to obtain the same fantastic rate.

We requested a quiet room high up and were allocated Room 702 and it was ideal. It was on the top floor and overlooking the park and had a good view. I would reccomend this side of the building as the other side overlooks a faily busy street and the room outlooks are into other buildings. The location is not particularly close to the main tourist attractions, ie Reichstag, Jewish Memorial, TV Tower etc. but the transport links are excellent - the bus stop is about 100 metres away with a 5 minute ride to the Zoo railway station then a 5 or 10 minute rail trip to the main tourist sites. There is a small supermarket just across the road for stocking up with milk, cornflakes etc. Again we have been pleased with the Citadines experience and would reccomend their Berlin accommodation. ps Higlight of our Berlin tour was a 'Fat Tire Bike Tour' - a good leisurely city tour seeing the main attracitons of comfy bikes.", "Date": "June 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw", "Title": "\u201cExcellent spot in the very heart of (West)Berlin\u201d", "Author": "Vannegen", "ReviewID": "UR65416817", "Content": "We stayed in this special unusual hotel for 3 nights and this was probably the best hotel we have had so far in Berlin (being there quite frequently).
