Calling the desk accomplished nothing, and after the 3rd call, I went to the front desk to discuss the issues and they seems bothered that I asked them to do something. Ridiculous... The food on the breakfast buffet was very bad and true staff there was clearly frustrated that they were forced to field the many complaints from the guests. With the decent location of this property, they would have to turn people away if they fired their existing food and beverage staff and upgraded the talent at the front desk.

The staff were not bending over backwards in the slightest and reluctant at times avoiding eye contact. We were ill advised by the staff even though as a lady with an elderly wheelchair bound and two young children, they should have taken more care. They ruined the trip for me by arranging a tour with a company who took a whole days money and ran off after 3 hours, together with not knowing that the Old City is impossile to navigate with a wheelchair let alone a broken one provided by them.

At the time of the booking I realized wrong rooms were booked and I contacted British airways to get correct rooms. They said to contact the hotel direct. I emailed and phoned hotels number of times and told them the rooms need to change ie...they booked 2 doubles but we had 2 adults and 5 children so we needed triples and extra beds. I was told by the reception that we will give you larger rooms if they are available. i asked them that to check the system now and take money from my card and change the rooms (ie....to check the availabilities now). i am a holier myself and know that this can be done. They said that at the time of check in just say that you want a different room. I told them that you may be full house on the day of check in. In any event I made all the logs of the call and made copied of the emails correspondences. On the day of arrival the reception staff said that there are too many people and you need to book another room and and demanding euro for extra room. I told them that 2 months before I was trying to sort this out but no one was listening. Any event I asked for the manager and a stone faced lady arrived without any warm or welcoming gestures and simply said what is the problem. I explained everything but she said same thing that you need to pay 200 euro for the night per room. Than I pulled out all my records of emails and phone call logs and they realised that they had cocked it up. To my surprise instead of apologizing and saying that \"yes\" you did tell us in advance they were embarrassed and said okay we will change the rooms and give you extra folding beds. I than kindly requested if they can keep the phone line in the rooms turned off and to empty the mini bar in the rooms as we had very young children aged 3, 4, 5 etc...and told them we do not want any alchole near the young children. At this time the manager and reception staff became very rude and said that this is not hostel or cheap hotel we are 5 start international hotel etc....you want extra beds, you want mini bar empty, you want this and that etc..... I was shocked and just said okay leave it and i will just pay. Oh my God,...... now further problems, I did not want to pay by my card and had a lot of cash with me. They said that we only accept euro and will charge you for the exchange rate for converting the money into Turkish Currency. I said that i already have Turkish currency so you can take it direct. They said that we will take Turkish currency and converted it into euro and than convert it back into Turkish etc.....this is stupid. They just wanted to make extra money and was embarrassed and you can see from there faces of what they were asking for was illogical. So now I had UK pounds and Turkish currency. I had to change UK Pounds into euro s and than into Turkish Currency and pay for all the exchange rates and fees, where as I already had lots of Turkish currency. In general the food and rooms were nice and the hotel is good. But staff will get 1 out of 10. The manager was very rude.

This is not ideal if you have just got off a long flight and have several suitcases. To be fair, when the bell staff spotted us they were out quickly to help. We booked a double room with an extra rollaway bed. When we got to the room the extra bed was not present and it took 2 hours and several calls for it to be brought up. On the last day we asked for some extra tea bags and were told that there would be an extra charge! This is the first time this has happened to me in hundreds of hotel stays! Finally, also on the last day we asked for a late checkout which was agreed with the front desk. Just after the normal checkout time our key cards stopped working (not a complete shock but it would have been nice if they had mentioned we would need to bring the cards to reception to allow access after 12 noon). I don't want this review to come across as a spoilt brat moan (as some reviews do!) so I will say that on the positive side the room was a decent size and comfortable and close to a number of attractions including the Grand Bazaar.

The breakfast buffet is extensive and includes Turkish dishes as well as more Western food. We have an IPad and were able to get that to work with the hotel's wireless connection (free).

From the airport the taxi ride costs about $30 Lira. There are many stories about the taxi's ripping you off, we ended up booking an airport transfer to and from the hotel, which costs about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac70. Very expensive in my opinion. While there are trains from the airport to the Sirkeci train station, it is not close to the hotel. I would recommend taking a taxi to the airport. The hotel was fantastic. The interior has the elegance and charm of what you would expect from Turkey. The rooms were quite nice. A nice flat screen TV and all mod con's. The rooms were a bit smaller than we were used too. The only thing that was a bit disappointing was the bathrooms were rather small, even for a petite person like myself, it was hard to move around in there. The rooms also had no bathtub, only a shower which was very nice and spacious. Our room didn't really have a view, but was not loud so you could get a good night's sleep after all that walking! We also had breakfast included in our package. It was excellent. The selection of foods you are presented with allows everyone to be satisfied. The food is all halal, so it was good. Foods range from Turkish teas, a variety of breads, pastries, eggs, sausages, fruit, cheeses, yoghurt, olives, cold cuts, etc. The food was also very good. A definite plus! The staff at the restaurant were also very good and helpful. The hotel is well situated. It's on a small street that turns into a main road. The main road is filled with shops and the tram stop is right in front of the hotel. If you like to walk you can enjoy all of the shops, restaurants and small kebap shops. The Grand Bazaar is about 10 minutes walking from the hotel. You can also walk to many of the main attractions from the hotel. The Haiga Sophia and the Blue Mosque and Topkapi Palace are all within walking distance from the hotel. Istanbul is definitely one of those cities where you have to walk around to really appreciate the city. You can get lost and find new little back street ally's, bazaar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The walk back to the hotel at night is also very safe; since it's a busy street we didn't feel unsafe at any time. There is also a lot of security at the hotel so it's very safe. We also tried out the swimming pool, sauna and stream room. All three were fantastic. The hotel also offers Turkish Bath services, but we did ours at the Cemberlitas Bath, which you can also walk to from the hotel. I didn't find the concierge very helpful. When we asked questions, we were provided with some quick answers, so I didn't bother asking any other questions. Also if you try to book a transfer from the hotel to the airport it will cost around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac40. I really enjoyed staying at this hotel.

I consider the location, hotel rooms and overall \"feeling\" of the hotel to be good, with a couple caveats. I would stay here again. Location: It's about 200 m to the tram stop, which is only 4 stops (5 min) from the heart of the Old Town. (You can also walk it in 15+ minutes, a straight shot down a major road.) There are plenty of smaller hotels closer to the heart of the Old City, so if this \"commute\" is not ideal for you, consider looking a little harder for one of those boutique / smaller places. The immediate neighborhood is busy and seems geared to locals shopping for clothes and goods, not really to tourists. Set-up: the hotel was originally a block of four apartment buildings (the most modern in the city at the time) and they've done a very nice job joining them under an atrium. During the summer it can be very hot in the common area downstairs; it doesn't seem like the AC is strong enough for the large area. In winter I assume this won't be an issue. The hotel is very attractive. Room selection: I STRONGLY recommend telling reception you do NOT want a Room in \"Block 2\". Most of the rooms in Block 2 open onto the dining area for breakfast, and it can be loud and there isn't much privacy. I've seen 3 - 4 other rooms in other blocks and the set-up is different for each. If you're not happy with the assigned room, consider asking to see another. The staff was accommodating on this front. Breakfast / restaurants: Not very good. I stopped eating the breakfast even though it was free. Concierge: I have stayed in 5 - 6 other hotels in Istanbul and found the level of knowledge and creativity to be lower than most. They seemed to focus on group tours and had a small number of options / distributors. I found most of the useful info online and with the concierge of a hotel I'd stayed in previously. The CP staff was helpful for restaurant reservations however. Meetings: Acceptable, though I'd suggest you confirm that AC will be adequate for the group.

Maybe it was just a mistake, not cheating, but it felt a bit awkward. The room price should have included both breakfast and some afternoon snacks but the staff claimed they had never heard about that kind of offers (even though we booked the room from hotel's official website). The worst thing was when we were leaving and they told us we had some 900 euros bill to their restaurant even though we hadn't even visited there during our stay.

Istanbul is a beautiful city with thousands of years of history, and the Crowne Plaza is a good location to use as a jumping-off point. It's less than a 10-minute walk to the Grand Bazaar, and only about another 10 minutes to the Blue Mosque, Haghia Sophia, Topkapi Palace and the Byzantine Cisterns, which are all located in Sultanahmet. The only downside is that you might not want to walk back at night, and taxis in Sultanahmet will charge you 2-3x the going rate. The hotel itself is actually four separate buildings connected by a glass-ceilinged courtyard that functions as the lobby, which is really quite breathtaking....the pics here on TripAdvisor really don't do it justice. The only problem is that the equivalent of two full flights of stairs awaits you in the walk from the curb to the front desk....you'd better hope the bellhops aren't busy when you arrive, or you'll be hoofing your luggage up five small (3-7 steps) sets of stairs just to check in. Once you've got your room key, you'll need to make sure that the front desk tells you which elevator to use. There are eight total, two for each building...but the buildings only connect on the ground floor, so unless you take the right one you'll be wandering the halls of one of the blocks of rooms searching for a room that isn't there. More frustration may await if your room happens to be on the 4th floor, since the elevators only go to the 3rd floor. The top floor is accessible only by small spiral staircases....make sure hotel personnel carry your heavier luggage up these. When we booked our rooms (for a local convention), the only ones left were suites. My wife and I were the first of our party to arrive, and were assigned rooms on the top floor....our suite literally looked like the attic in an old farmhouse. Low, vaulted ceilings required us to be careful not to hit our heads when walking in the corners of the room, and our only windows were small circular portholes....artificial light was the only way to adequately light the room. More annoying was the musty, mildewy smell that permeated the entire room....surprising, since the hotel claims it has been refurbished bottom-to-top within the last year. You never know if the hotel room you've booked (no matter how bad it is) is actually the best room in the house or not, so I kept my mouth shut until the rest of our party arrived and I saw the two suites they were assigned (on lower floors). They were easily twice the size, had large bay windows and had zero offending odor. We immediately asked for another room, and were disappointed to be given another 4th floor location. However, this room had no smell. Good enough. We didn't take advantage of the fitness center or the pool, but we did eat breakfast each day at the buffet. The quality of the food seemed to vary from day-to-day, but overall we were rather disappointed. That said, the coffee was incredible....possibly the best I've ever had. In the future I think we'll probably stay in the Sultanahmet area, since there are so many cafes and restaurants nearby...there are also quite a bit more hotel options, from large chains to small boutique properties.

When checking in, I got a very spacious corner room which was very nice as the size was almost suite-class. The downside was a lot of noise from the busy street, but as I have no problems sleeping it didn't really matter to me. The WLAN was too poor to work in the room, and when I complained they blamed the weather (??), but gave me an ethernet cable, which worked fine for me.

If Taksim area's hotels are too pricy, I would suggest find something in the Sultanahmet area (near Blue Mosque and Haggia Sofia) instead. This Crowne Plaza hotel did not posess good management style, deserving for a 5-stars hotel ranking. It appeared to me they did not give great service once they knew we booked through internet services. Truly, if it was their orders to mis-treat internet-booking guests then the hotel management ought not allow for internet bookings - Period. On our 1st day, when we arrived to front desk, the 1st attendant asked for my name, she checked her hotel record, then passed me to another male attendant. He gave us a room on 4th floor. It was a room in the attic with low ceiling and cut-off windows. Their hotel elevators only went up to 3rd floor and we had to walk another flight of stairs to 4th floor. We asked to switch to another room and they said the hotel was all booked. Secondly, It was written at their website that a complimentary bottle of wine were given as promotional offer for any hotel booking. It took me 4 times asking front desk for this complimentary bottle of wine ! First they denied the promotional offer and after seeing their bad service and treatment, I felt that I should insist to have it. Finally after 2 days and 4 times of asking, they gave me a tiny (1 glass size) bottle of red wine. On 1st night, I asked front desk for a wake up call and never received it in the morning. When I inquired about this on the next day, instead of apologize properly to any guest, they just denied, said they did call. When we checked out, they never gave us an invoice. When we asked for invoice they were reluctant to provide. I find this to be quite absurd.

Even the tour guide recommended not walking around there after 9 or 10 pm. We also ran into a couple of honeymooners from Spain at the hotel and the wife shared with us her same fear. Need I mention further, she was with her husband and she still felt similar scare. Besides the bad hotel choice... if you visit Istanbul, do take the 1 day sight-seeing Bosphorus cruise and see the Sultan's Summer palace. Very nice architecture and grand tour of the palace. Do try the Turkish bath (called Hamam) at certain reputable location only. The location we were recommended, was called \"Cemberlitas Hamami\", sited in a historical building, at Cembelitas metro stop. There are various price packages. I took the top package for 105 Euro and received a full body scrub by a female attendant, facial mask and 1/2 hour full body massage. Certainly, it was an interesting experience indeed.", "Date": "November 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "emsworth", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "dartmeet", "ReviewID": "UR48246424", "Content": "Huge hotel in prime location just off main road, near tram stop and good eateriesand 4 tram stops from main sights.

The hotels gym was not too bad considering it only had 3 cardio machines but it had a good rande of dumbells and a indoor pool with sauna and spa . We didnt eat at the hotel but had drinks in the lobby/bar area and found it pleasant enough . The hotel is located near the tram stop Lalalei University and it costs 1.50 lira to use . Bear in mind you need to buy a Jeton which is a token first but these are easy to buy from shops located near/next to the tram stops. We caught the metro and then the tram in from the airport ,not only was it easy but also cheaper the the vultures posing as taxi drivers . Take the metro from the lower ground floor making sure you buy at least 2 Jetons each and get off 6 stops later at Zeythinburu , transfer to the tram that heads to Kabatas and get off at Lalelei University and walk 2 blocks down the road and turn right into Fetherby and the hotel is 25m on the right. The hotel was within walking distance of the grand bazzar and also the blue mosque and Sophia Hagia.
