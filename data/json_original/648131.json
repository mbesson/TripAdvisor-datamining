We sent clothing to the dry cleaner's, and they deliver nothing else to the fourth day, than a cap, they say than the other one they will give it tomorrow, if I get to know it before.

Every member of staff from the outstanding Directrice to the Trainee waitress who took a delight in serving us daily, and was almost in tears when we left, knew his/her job perfectly and took a professional pride in making our stay as pleasant as possible. The stay was more than pleasant - it was superb and we left with the full intention of returning there next year and renewing, despite a terribly long air trip to reach Bali.We were on half board. The hotel provides an excellent breakfast and we alternated between lunch and dinner in the hotel and discovering local eateries in the vicinity for the other meal. Opposite the hotel's entrance there is an excellent car hire shop and their driver, who speaks some English is very good. I can thoroughly recommend him. An excellent trip is to Lovina Beach on the North coast, but if you go there do not eat at the Rice Terraces restaurant, where we had the only poor meal in Bali.There are lots of good eating places in the close vicinity of the hotel - I hesitate to endorse any because One man's meat..... but I don't think you'd be too disappointed with any.I would go back there any time.", "Date": "Aug 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR829351703", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "berwicker"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel       After 2 hours", "Date": "Jun 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR617765551", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "MicandTez"}, {"Content": "Great family hotel       lower floors outside", "Date": "May 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR310762192", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "denpete52"}, {"Content": "Could have been a lot better The location of the hotel was great, it was right in the midst of all the shopping and restaurants. The hotel rooms were clean but shabby, Management could think about renovating. The food was pretty good. The pool was very small and very average although it had a very nice swim up bar. The staff weren't all that friendly and when we finally checked out, our pool towel tickets had mysteriously(and i use the term loosely) disappeared from our table in our room and they tried to charge us a phenominal amount of money to pay them for the terrible pool towels that we didn't have! then they demanded an apology letter for us losing the pool towel tickets??

Helpful staff. But basic Stayed recently at the Adhi Dharma hotel (although the Adhi dharma cottage seemed more tempting). The rooms are very basic and a bit old in appearance. Its time to upgrade. The bed linens were also not very clean.Also the AC kept on dripping continiuously.The staff is very friendly and the service is with a smile. Location wise, no room for complain. Its close to kuta and legian beaches yet a step away from the noisy kuta. The swimming pool is alsonice, though on the smaller side.
