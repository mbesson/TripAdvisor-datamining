As it was my wifes birthday the receptionist arranged for a card and cake to be sent up to our room within minutes of us checking in which we thought was a nice touch. The suite itself ws superb- spacious and well furnished. On our first night and to celebrate my wifes birthday, we ate in the `First Floor` restaurant-what an experience ! The food and service was magnificent and made for a very memorable night. The breakfast served in the hotel was also extremely good. There was a good choice of both hot and cold food. The food was distinguised by its freshness and the staff were helpful and friendly.We were able to walk into the restaurant without having to queue which is not always the case even in five star hotels. We visited the leisure centre on a number of occasions which was very enjoyable. The only problem with the centre was that the jacuzzi is actually part of the pool which means it is filled with pool water at pool temperature. It is usually better if the jacuzzi is seperately heated. That being said, the centre was of a high standard and well worth visiting. The hotel is well positioned in Berlin. It is close to both U-bahn and S-bahn stations and there is a bus stop virtually outside the hotel. This made getting around berlin very easy. All in all this was a first class hotel in a first class location. The staff were friendly and helpful. We were made to feel welcome which is very important in any hotel.

It's a well-run, clean hotel with a sumptuous breakfast buffet and excellent conference support. But the place is under a floor-by-floor renovation, and I stayed in a not-yet-renovated room. It was certainly clean, and big enough. But the furnishings are, in fact, in need of a good upgrade -- I would not be surprised if the decor was in place before the Wall fell. And to get to my floor, I had to take one elevator, hike one km, then take another to my floor, then another good walk. So for a spoiled American, it was a bit of a steeplechase to get to my room each time. Internet connectivity is expensive, at EUR 20 per day, but reliable. But the Hotel Palace makes up for this inconvenience (they use a third-party provider and can't control the cost) with a voluptuous breakfast buffet that includes more than six kinds of cheese, six kinds of sausage, lovely soft-scrambled eggs, and the usual mix of sweet and savory choices that Germans (and others) love to consume before starting the day.

The hotel is clearly extremely well managed and staffed, with everyone very friendly and helpful. You never had to wait more than a few seconds for a lift. Common areas were good - the lobby with deep sofas and scattered books was welcoming and a great place to relax and meet up. I enjoyed the calm of the bar, and the great pianist, after walking through the war-zone that is Berlin on NYE. There were always sweets or fruit or doughnuts (berliners?) at reception, and the receptionist and concierge were very helpful with suggestions and advice. You certainly feel special here, as a guest. The breakfast buffet, included in the room price, was truly awesome, and I'd recommend it to non-guests too, since the breakfast room has a lovely view over the zoo. I didn't try out the pool/spa but staff pointed it out to me in case I wanted to use it. I had a single room which was disappointing in two ways: the woodwork (especially the desk area) was chipped and looked cheap, and there were hardly any electric sockets, particularly by the desk. I had to shift the heavy desk and unplug the TV to plug in my laptop, and there was no sensible place to plug in the room kettle apart from putting it on the floor which didn't seem particularly safe. That, and the high cost of internet access (17 euros a day for leisure use, higher for business) led me to believe that the hotel needs a redesign to cater properly for the digital age. Apart from that the room was great - comfortable, clean, well-equipped - and I slept well. I would happily stay again, certainly for the price we paid which was a steal for NYE (booked a couple of months in advance). I would, however, try to have a better plan for data access. My mobile wifi provider had let me down, and I refused to pay 17 euros for in-room internet access, so I felt a bit isolated from the digital world. If your company is paying, fine.

The most attractive features of this hotel are its superb location and the excellent breakfast. Besides these, unfortunately, nothing is perfect, which at the end made us very disappointed and ranked this hotel into the not recommended category. The hotel is located very close to the Zoologischer Garten which is a perfect starting point to discover Berlin. The hotel building is neither nice nor impressive from outside because it is a big concrete building. Our standard room was relatively big but not huge with oldish furnitures, several of them showing wears and tears. The view from our room was somewhat depressing as we saw the wall of another building. In general the room was comfortable, although the bed was made of two mattresses with a notable gap between them. The bathroom was quite big, it had both a shower and a tub. However, we experienced several problems with the bathroom, which should not occur in a hotel, which tries to sell itself as a five star hotel. First, the ventilation in the bathroom was either not working or was very ineffective. Although I asked the reception to do something with it, they did not do anything. Second, the water was continuously flowing in the toilet at a slow but steady rate. Finally, the door of the shower was not closing properly, so if the shower was oriented in the wrong direction, all the water was ending up on the floor of the bathroom. The staff was generally nice and helpful, but there was one guy at the reception, who was just rude. The breakfast buffet is great, a huge selection of high quality food is offered, we really liked it. However, we sometimes experienced that the staff is simply not numerous enough in the busiest hours to remove used plates and clean tables quickly. We were very surprised about the prices of additional services at this hotel: the minibar prices are sort of expensive, movies for 16 Euros are overpriced, but the fact that they try to charge 22 Euros per day or 88 Euros per week for internet is simply arrogant! I think the managers of this hotel did not recognize that if they charge a lot of money for some service, it does not mean automatically that it will be exclusive or outstanding. In our opinion this hotel is very far from being a five star hotel, we have already stayed in much nicer four star hotels in Germany. If you are looking for a hotel in Berlin, I would suggest to either go for a decent four star hotel in the neighborhood (there are many!) or go for a real (!) five star hotel, which is also available in the direct neighborhood of this hotel. Thus, we do not recommend this hotel!", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "washington, dc", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing, good location for shopping, but not 5 star\u201d", "Author": "suzannedc", "ReviewID": "UR112928662", "Content": "This hotel is in a very good location for shopping. Some of the staff were very nice and helpful, especially in the lobby bar and housekeeping. The breakfast is a really fantastic buffet with enormous variety in a very large room upstairs. The problem is that this hotel describes itself as 5 star, and it will be seriously disappointing for many people. The best way to describe the problem with this hotel: for every good thing you want to say, there is unfortunately something very unpleasant that you also need to say. It is not near the quality of the 5 star hotels in Berlin, several of which are legendary, and most of which are plush and treat their guests with a care and style that makes the experience distinct and special. In the immediate area, there are three 4-star hotels which are more impressive and easier to recommend. To describe this hotel: it is in a rather unattractive concrete building, but the lobby has a pretty bar and a lovely living room area. There is a whiff of kitsch or strange taste here and there, and some of the front desk staff can be a bit rough, and heard speaking to guests in a way you might not expect from even a very modest hotel. It is a shame as some of the other staff are pleasant and helpful, and some younger staff at the desk are eager to please, if not fully comfortable in their jobs. In general there is a lack of polish and professionalism you would expect from a hotel of several stars. My room was very large, but had pronounced stains on the carpet and also on the upholstery. But there was a very thorough cleaning crew each day, and also a supervising housekeeper who came to check that all was properly cleaned. I thought the bathroom was very clean, and the amenities were good. Although breakfast was a very impressive buffet, it is not an elegant experience, but more like a chaotic lunchroom with wait staff rushing to get coffee and maintain the tables. Staff start taking the buffet away bang on time, and if guests arrive ten minutes late you can watch them reaching for food at the same time that the staff are removing it essentially from their grasp. We wondered if during the holidays they employ untrained temp staff? We also saw a chef throwing food away into a bin, in full view of late-arriving guests (a few minutes late) who were told the meal was finished so they would have to see what they might be able to grab. I suppose many luxury hotels would have staff that graciously apologize and maybe intercede to try to help the guest put some food on a plate, especially if there are many other guests still eating, and the arrival is just a few minutes past the finish of the food service. The concierge staff were unavailable to make restaurant suggestions and reservations (the telephone was usually busy and they were not always present at the desk or contactable) and tickets for events were a bit misunderstood. The spa looked nice, though I believe there were fees to use much of it. In sum I think you could say this is a 4-star hotel in a good position for shopping, and with an indoor spa pool and very clean rooms, a very good lobby bar and living area, but uneven staff and rooms, and a strange atmosphere, all of which could make your stay a little unpleasant, unfortunately. It is probably not necessary to stay at this hotel, as there are several very impressive and well-reviewed 4 star hotels which will provide a much nicer and more polished experience. Just in case it is important, internet was not free, and rather extremely expensive-- it may have been 20 euros or more per day. In all fairness many luxury hotels charge for internet, but here the price was especially steep.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in good location\u201d", "Author": "RunningCanuck", "ReviewID": "UR112287268", "Content": "My husband, five year old daughter and I stayed at the Hotel Palace from June 6th to 8th, 2011.

The Business Suite is essentially equal to the InterConti Club rooms (in size). The 5 star rating is well deserved in every aspect. The staff is pleasant and friendly. Service is very good. The Palace definitely has won me over. A couple of minor issues: the TV in the business suite is way to far away from the bed.

As the hotel claims 5 star status and charges the corresponding steep rates one would expect a perfect stay. Unfortunately, they do not live up to this status. On arrival at the hotel our room was not ready yet. The front desk staff offered us a complimentary drink in the lobby bar while they arranged a room assignment. Unfortunately, the drinks -- two mineral waters and a red wine -- were charged to the room, and no-one seemed to remember the fact that drinks were offered complimentary. Upon entering our assigned room, a nice newly renovated room, I was under the impression that their was a length issue with the bed. I realized later on that we had probably been mistaking, but at the time we were convinced that the room did not have a 200cm bed, but a 190cm version. Being almost 2m long, that is a real issue. We talked about the issue with the front desk staff and were assigned a different room. I was disappointed with the smoke odor in the second room which was also present in the sheets and mattrass and is the main reason for me to rate the overall hotel experience as negative. The rest of the hotel is nice and clean. The lobby is quiet nice, the spa has a small pool and connected whirlpool area as well as a gym.

I booked one night through Hotels.com (even so, not inexpensive) and they put me in the worst room in the house. Not only was it miniscule and cramped in every way, but it stank of stale cigarrete smoke, dingy, tired and peeling wallpaper - no view, no air. It was gross. I called the front desk and asked to see a different room - and they showed me an out-dated junior-ish suite. At least it was a clean, non-smoking room with some space. Later, my mother-in-law explained to me that they keep rooms like the first one they showed in many European hotels for the hired help - a chauffeur or nanny who may be travelling with a wealthy family. She hypothosized that because I was a single woman, travelling alone and that I had booked online, they assumed that I would be docile or something, and take the first room that I was offered. That said, the swimming pool really was beautiful (though a bit small) - with wonderful scenes painted around it - and the upgraded room a relief - sheets were clean and the room was good enough. Overall, the people were kind, the lobby is fun to sit in, and the experience was ultimately worth the price that I paid for it.

The temperature of the sauna was \"\u00e0 point\" and the herbs they use gave a pleasant smell. The only minus is that you need to pay an additional 7\u20ac to use the sauna (but not the swimming pool, which is for free) Our room was perfectly cleaned up every day. They send in a \"controller\" to check the work of the cleaning staff. Again, the staff is very friendly Our room was very large and spacious, I enjoyed it For me an internet connection is important. They offer wireless and LAN internet...the quality was \"broadband\" as well the price...I don't see why one has to pay 88\u20ac for a week., I don't need to put coins in the shower even to get it working :( I was very pleased with the overall and outstanding quality of this hotel.", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fredensborg", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel service but with few flaws\u201d", "Author": "DahlFamily", "ReviewID": "UR14427982", "Content": "My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Palace Hotel in Berlin.

Half of Palace Hotel has been renovated recently and consists of contemporary landings and bedrooms/suites. The other block (directly above the main entrance) is still trapped in the 1970's time warp that's been mentioned by previous contributors. Unfortunately I ended up in the latter half! Whilst the room was indeed large, clean and functional it lacked the finishing touches that one expects from 5-star accommodation. The service at the hotel was reasonable, though I did find the concierge to be particularly unhelpful. However one of the redeeming features of the Palace Hotel is its location. The hotel can be reached from Tegel Airport by catching the X9 or slower 109 bus and getting off at the last stop (Zoologischer S+U Bahn). Close to the hotel are the 100 and 200 bus routes which pass all the major tourist sites - a far better option than taking a tourist bus. The hotel is situated in the only area of the city that has not seen major redevelopment in the past 20 years. However it is in close proximity to the major shopping street (Ku\u2019damm) and other tourist attractions (e.g. the Zoo, Aquarium, Kaiser Wilhelm Church, the Ka-De-We Dept Store). If you are going to be making use of the fantastic public transport across Berlin, then this hotel is an ideal (though slightly expensive) base from which to explore this amazing city. The Restaurants in the hotel are okay, though if not eating in the hotel I would advise you to look further a field as the restaurants/caf\u00e9\u2019s close by are not particularly good. The exception is the 7th floor restaurant at the Ka-De-We. The health facilities in the hotel are good, though the swimming pool was a bit short for my liking. However the staff is helpful and provide you with towels, dressing gown and sandals (to avoid you slipping on the floor). The spa facilities are also nice but cost an extra \u20ac7 per day. For those looking for things to do whilst in Berlin, I would highly recommend the walking tours offered by Original Berlin Walks (Discover Berlin) and Sandemans New Berlin (Red Berlin Tour and the Free Tour).

We tried it a couple of times but it was expensive - however the service was excellent. Our room on the 6th floor was enormous. The decor was a little dated. The bathroom had a bath and separate shower. There were two twin beds connected together to make a double - this was not very comfortable and let the room down, somewhat. The room can get a little noisy if you leave the windows open - but not with the traffic noise, the animals in the famous Zoo, that is close by, get a little boisterous it seems! The Zoo S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations are very close and ideal for central Berlin and for excursions to Wannsee (pronounced Vannzee) and Potsdam (Sans Souci is a World Heritage Site and worth spending at least a day there, but make sure you also visit the \"Forbidden City\" where the KGB had their German headquarters). You can walk from the hotel to the very pleasant Tiergarten, although take a one-stop trip on the S-Bahn if you like. Buy a day ticket that covers all travel on the S-Bahn and U-Bahn - although check which areas it covers. You can get week tickets but they end on a Sunday so not of any use to us. The S-Bahn and U-Bahn are excellent. The local area has lost much of its charm since the Wall (and the government handouts) stopped.

There are so many places to see in Berlin and a long weekend is certainly not long enough-you could spend two days at the shops alone!!Great bargains to be had at this time of year as all the shops have sales-some with 50% reductions. One thing I would avoid is the hop on,hop off city tour.At 20 euros each this was an absolute rip off.Yes you can hop on and off,but if you want to go back to say stop number 2 after you get off at stop number 5,you have to get back on the next bus that comes along to stop number 5 and go all the way round again as the tours only go in one direction which can take nearly 2 hours.It is much easier (and cheaper) to buy a day ticket for 6 euros and jump off and on the number 100 or 200 buses which pass all the sight anyway.

We stayed for the weekend at the Palace Hotel Berlin. We chose this hotel because of the location (near shopping) and because it is a member of Leading Hotels of the World (LHW). Having stayed at other LHW properties (including the Adlon in Berlin), I'm not sure how the Palace made it into their membership list. If you are looking for a basic business hotel (a la Radisson or Sheraton), then this is probably a good choice. As other reviewers have posted, the rooms are large by European standards, clean and nice, and it is a plus that the bathtub and shower are separate. Convenient transportation is close by, as is shopping. However, this is definitely not a luxury hotel. The amenities (hand soap, mouthwash, shampoo, and body wash were all) are hotel brand, and sickly-sweet smelling to top it off -- not what I'm used to from LHW. We were looking forward to room service our first night, and while it was nicely presented, we were disappointed at the few main course choices on the menu, and they forgot to bring napkins, so we had to use kleenex. We had booked a King Deluxe through the hotel, and our room had two 90x200 beds pushed together to make a king size...not what we expected. To make matters worse, the rooms were very hot, and the air con apparently is turned off for the winter. We couldn't open the window because our window was right next to some equipment (too noisy). Worst of all, the mattress was covered with a plastic liner (for hygenic reasons, we were told), so we sweat all night. Fortunately, the front desk was able to move us to a different room with a regular king bed on a higher floor the second night; sleeping with the window open was a bit more comfortable. Going to Potsdamer Platz one evening, I asked at the front desk (there was no concierge present) for nearby dining suggestions, such as a nice German restaurant. The front desk clerk (who'd been there all weekend), informed me that there were lots of restaurants, but her only suggestion was the chain steakhouse Maredo...not very helpful. She also directed us to the bus stop, but failed to inform us we'd need coins to pay, so we missed the bus while we returned to the hotel for coins.

There was an area set aside for smokers at the back of the room so the rest of us were OK. But the breakfast room is where I found fault. One day a lady was allowed to bring her dog into the breakfast room and more seriously there were no guards over the food to protect against coughs and sneezes.

The zoo and garden opposite the hotel is a must if you have children, it's nice. Also sightseeing tours is a must also to take you around the main landmarks in Berlin. Don't expect to find bargains in the shops, but the food and drinks is cheaper than England.

If you've booked to stay there, then you've made the best choice.", "Date": "July 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location and Service\u201d", "Author": "jomito", "ReviewID": "UR5497824", "Content": "Recently stayed at the Palace Hotel for two days in July. The service was excellent in every respect. The location cannot be beat. As I had children in tow being located across the street from the Berlin Zoo entrance was extra appealing. As most of Europe was suffering from an oppressive heat wave, we were able to cool off in the superb indoor pool. Only steps away from the KaDeWe department store, a 10 euro cab ride to Check Point Charlie and 15-20 minutes by cab yto Tegal airport. Every staff member in th hotel went out of the way to be accommodating. 5 stars!!!", "Date": "July 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Syracuse", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4997322", "Content": "Good Location - Beautiful Hotel - Excellent Room and Great Breakfast Very Good Service and Welcoming Staff", "Date": "April 23, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Palace Berlin", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d199395-Reviews-Hotel_Palace_Berlin-Berlin.html", "Price": "$125 - $305*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Budapesterstrasse 45</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10787</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "199395", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/28/49/71/hotel-palace-berlin.jpg"}}
