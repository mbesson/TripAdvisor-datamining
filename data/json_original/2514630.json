It's one of those narrow hotels with only 8 or so rooms to a floor, to fit into the Manhattahan neighborhood. The staff is usually attentive and nice. The rooms are usually maintained in good shape. It's an industrial style, so heavy metal desk and side tables are the norm, but they look good. The rooms are not that large at all, but that's to be expected for this type of hotel of hotel in Manhattan, and they're big enough to do the job. Room rates can range quite a bit, from around $170 to over $450, so the value for price paid can vary a lot as well. We tend to do point redemptions for this hotel, as it's only 10,000 Starwood points per night, plus you can get the 5th night free, so 5 nights for 40,000 points is a good target. The hotel restaurant, Las Chicas Locas, spills outdoors into a seating area. It looks like folks are having fun there in the evening due to the ambiance. We tend to only use the restaurant for an occasional breakfast, but I would think people are going there to have fun more than they are the food. We did have one experience where we got a ticket while parked in the loading zone at the front of the hotel, since we didn't leave one person in the car who could verify to the police office that we were indeed 'loading' at the hotel. We did submit documentation and get the ticket revoked, so that was OK in the end. The hotel has some little placards you can throw in your window, so if you're by yourself, go in and grab one right away and put it in ther window while you check in. The official parking garage for the hotel is a little ways, over at 8th Ave and 26th st, so you can either roll your luggage one long and one short block, or check in first and then go park. It's convenient to FIT, and subways access is handy at 23rd and 28th streets.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cReliable, but a few concerns\u201d", "Author": "SeattleMan", "ReviewID": "UR127253366", "Content": "This is a standard, clean hotel in a great location if you want Chelsea - near the Village, numerous Chelsea art galleries, colleges, etc. Ours was a mixed experience. I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights with my daughter. Room services were very good \u2013 the room was spotless each day, and the one time we made a special request it was addressed quickly and there was a follow-up call from the front desk to make sure it had happened. The front desk was similarly and cheerfully responsive to a number of small requests \u2013 a dinner reservation, info about getting a cab, etc. The rooms are small, but not by NYC standards. Sadly, after 2 nights on an uncomfortable bed my daughter decided to sleep in her dorm room instead of the hotel. The blinds hang 2 inches away from the windows, so it was essentially impossible to make the room dark at night without putting a blanket up over the windows - which takes considerable effort! My last night \u2013 before getting up at 5am to catch a taxi to JFK \u2013 I was wakened by garbage collection right in front of the hotel.

Check-in was easy, and since we arrived early, they held our bags in storage until our room was ready. The location is great for wandering around Manhattan. And the street is pretty quiet, which makes for sound sleeping. If you go on a weekend, there are two awesome flea markets just down the street on Sundays. The rooms vary in size -- two of us shared a smaller room that was more cramped, and the other two had a larger room with more space. Although the rooms were clean, the furniture is pretty banged up. There was also no luggage rack, which annoyed me, but I don't know where it would've gone anyway. The beds were comfortable with fluffy pillows, but the sheets rustled really loudly. I was worried I was going to wake my friend up every time I turned over. The bathroom was clean, partially new and partially old, but very clean. Great water pressure in the shower and the usual comically small towels you find at most budget-priced chains. About the wi-fi: we were given a password, but when we tried to connect, none of our smartphones could get on the network. If we were staying for longer, I probably would've mentioned it to someone. But for one night, we just didn't care enough. Some of the employees were perfectly nice, but a few were less than friendly, like they would rather be doing anything instead of working there. Not even a smile. Is your life really that bad that you can't even smile at your guests? One other thing to note: there are only two elevators, and they're tiny. Just something to keep in mind. Oh, and don't expect to get the right drink out of the vending machine. My friend went to get a Coke Zero and ended up with an orange Fanta instead. She did get her money back, though.

We were on the 4th floor and never heard the bar/nightclub below as some complain about. The bar is actually small so whoever called it a nightclub must live in a shoe. It is a nice bar though with decent bartenders. I believe it is a tequilla bar. We never heard crazy loud music pumping at all and noone was dancing. It was a holiday weekend, so I think guests had other places they'd rather be, however. The rooms are not bad in terms of size, compared to other places. They are very clean, smell nice and have an updated decor. There is a small closet and a shelf above the desk to store other items. The bathroom has no place to put makeup bags. It was easier to blowdry hair out in the bedroom area with the full length mirror. It is walking distance to the garden/penn station. One woman at the front desk helped us with transportation options, as we had to go to a wedding on New Yr's Eve on Park Ave. I forgot her name...she was Asian-- very nice girl. We ended up taking limo service because cabs were scarce and it would have been the same price with the amount of traffic that night any way. The parking was $55 for valet and they end up just billing the credit card on file. We had a large truck so I think it was 45 or 50 for a smaller car.

The room itself was very clean and comfortable. The size was pretty good, too. I had a room with two double beds, and there was still room to put out my suitcase, etc. The bathroom was pretty small, but got the job done. It was clean, which (for me) is more important than size anyways. My only complaints about the bathroom were that every time I took a shower, the floor would get soaked (the shower curtain didn't do it's job very well), and the tub drained slowly. Call me crazy, but I don't like taking a shower and standing in a couple inches of soapy water. I never called them to take care of the drain though, as I think it's a common problem for a lot of hotels. The toilet also had a \"magic flush\" that took some getting used to. The view was awesome. I had a room on the 16th floor facing south (1602). I actually think this is not one of their \"city view\" rooms, but I had a great view of the under-construction One World Trade Center. Very cool to wake up to and go to bed to. The room had an operable window that I used quite a bit to get some fresh air into the room (ok, \"fresh\" is debatable, but some outdoor air). The HVAC didn't seem to work very well, but I can't really comment on it because I bypassed it for the window most of the time. There was a lot of noise at night though - sounded like a rooftop bar was around somewhere (people yelling and screaming and just having a good time). It didn't bother me, but for some people, it may not have been the best situation. The hotel is in a decent location - it's definitely not out of the loop by any means, but it's far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the city to be quiet and comfortable. A couple subway stops are pretty close - I mostly used the 1 on 23rd and 7th or the F on 23rd and 6th. Both were literally a five minute walk and could get you almost anywhere you would want to go. Speaking of 23rd - it's one of the busier crosstown streets and is only two blocks south of the hotel. My only major complaint was the terrible WiFi. It was easy to connect, but the speed was so incredibly slow, I was better off using my cell phone for most things I needed. All in all, I would say this was a great stay.

However, hotel management has a different definition on the meaning of a view. They gave us a room that faced a inner area, towards a brick wall. When we brought this to their attention, instead of apologizing, they were visably annoyed that we were persistant in requesting them change our room. Finally, they gave us a room that was slightly above the roof of nearby building but I would hardly call this a 'VIEW'. We were not nasty to them so I think it is extremely poor customer service for hotel management to have attitude towards guests who expect what they paid for. We were willing to stay in an inferior room but they should somehow adjust the price accordingly. In the end, the room we got was spacious enough but starting to look a little worn out which is suprising since it is a relatively a new hotel. The bathroom was very small and hardly any room on the vanity for toiletries. So women beware if you come with a suitcase of makeup! LOL. Sink in bathroom leaked, towels were thin, worn out, had holes and/or slight tears. Will find and post the pics to prove this. Beds were horrible unless you love beds in which you sink in and need to climb out of the hole. To me, a bed should be firm but comfortable.

I called down and confirmed that breakfast was served until 11:00 AM and so we arrived at the restaurant (a small place in the back of the building) at 10:20 AM, only to find out that the chef decided to \"leave early\" and that they therefore couldn't seat us. The rooms and hotel are very mediocre. I found the room to be lacking on the finishings and there were plenty of scuffs, chips, etc. that made it feel a bit more run down since the last time I stayed there. The size is okay--typical of NYC rooms. I'm extremely glad that I used Starwood points for the stay rather than paying the $400/night that they were asking. For that price, there are plenty of other nicer hotels in the city. Overall, I really liked the location and it was extremely convenient for what we needed to do for the weekend.

We arrived a little before three and our room was ready. The front desk was very friendly and gave us our complimentary (and tasty) cupcake. As Starwood guests, we were on the 19th floor. We choose this hotel based on price and location. We've always had good experiences with Sheraton properties. Also, we were visiting friends and attending a social event and the location of this resort was key to doing both. Pros: Our room was a decent size (we are used to the small rooms you find in NYC and did not think this one was that bad in comparison). The king-sized bed was extremely comfortable. Upon arrival, we called for more pillows and towels and within five minutes, they arrived. Front desk was very friendly and gave us the late check out we had requested upon booking the hotel. The room includes a coffee maker and a bottle of water. Our view was great, overlooking the Empire State Building. The location was great and we had no problems getting cabs. The restaurant was hopping both nights we were there. Saturday night was a Halloween party and we had a hard time finding a seat for a drink. We did share a quesadilla earlier in the day and it was delicious. (My DH thought it was one of the best steak quesadillas he has ever had) We were disappointed it was only open for dinner. Cons: Not many but here they are. Only one bottle of water, one robe, and one cupcake at check-in while there were two of us staying there. Really, they couldn't supply two to accomadate the two guests staying there? The water pressure in the shower flucuated often (yet, the temperature stayed the same). Only one side of the bed had a night stand and it would have been nice to have one on both sides.

To begin with, New York hotels are expensive all year around even for a single room especially during the summer months. So when I found out this hotel offers a special rate of $140 a night for a nice double room in the middle of Manhattan with free internet included, I had to jump on the deal even it is 3 months ahead! Location of the hotel is simply unbeatable - in the heart of Chelsea between 6th & 7th. Hotel premise is on the quiet W. 25th street, totally tucked away from the busy traffic. So many shops and restaurants around and easy walking distance to subway stations with multiple metro lines (E line at 8th/23rd St. takes you directly to JFK). Definitely a good base for NYC trips. It is a not a new hotel but 4 Points did a good job of maintaining the interior/decor updated. My room was definitely roomy (considering this is NYC and you will pay a premium for space) and nicely decorated with two twin-beds, work station, LCD tv and an OK bathroom. Couldn't be happier with the space. . Hotel does come with a nice bar and a restaurant with outdoor seating which I did not use as NYC is filled with great eateries in every neighborhood so it's best to explore the dining options outside. Internet as mentioned, is included in the rate but there are two free computer downstairs in the lobby for guest use if you don't have a laptop. Many reviews here complained about the front desk staff and service but I did not encounter such problem during my entire stay. In fact, I considered them pretty ok, I guess it all depends on who you ran into. Maid service, on the other hand, could have been a bit better but it did not bother me too much. In all, this is an above average hotel from the amenities point of view. However for the room space you get - if you find a good rate, I must say this hotel provides some very good value. I have stayed in a number of other NYC hotels with smaller rooms, older facilities, mediocre service and significantly higher price before, all I can say is this 4 Point Sheraton certainly beats all of them.

Check-in by Lauren was very pleasant, personable and efficient. Upon check we were given a fresh baked cupcake from Billy\u2019s Bakery.

The beds were three quarter size but very comfortable with nice lines and duvets. The room was cleaned exceptionally well and fresh towels and facecloths were provided each day. Bottled water and Starbucks Coffee were supplied and replenished each day. Additionally, bottled water was available and complimentary at the front desk. The location was great for our needs. We walked about 7 short blocks each morning to Penn Station to catch the Long Island Railroad to the National Tennis Center. Along the way we stopped for bagels at the Bagel Maven Caf\u00e9 and Hot and Crusty inside Penn Station, both tasty and inexpensive. We also took the 1 Train to and from Times Square; very easy, very quick. Although we did not, you can transfer to the 7 train at the Times Square Station and travel to the National Tennis Center via subway. Check out was pleasant and efficient.

It's not in bad condition, but there are clear signs of wear in a variety of places and there are some maintenance issues. The door to the bathroom in our room dragged on the threshold and had to be forced closed, which made it quite noisy to open again. There is virtually no counter space for toiletries in the bathroom. Other concerns included two maddeningly slow elevators and thin walls that made a nearby baby sound as though it was in the same room with us. The A/C in our room died shortly after we checked in and we called the front desk and were informed that someone would be up to check it. We left and returned later in the evening and it was still not working. We called the front desk again and were advised that the maintenance person had told them that it wouldn't be working again any time soon and so they were waiting to see what we wanted to do (we thought this an odd response, as we certainly weren't going to stay in that room). Some sort of note or message about this would've been more proactive and helpful. We asked for a new room, and after two callbacks, we were eventually relocated to one with a working A/C. The TV channel selection is rather limited. The in-house restaurant has a very limited menu, most of which consists of tiny appetizer plates, although the menu does not explain this. The quality of the food was mediocre. The front desk staff was a mixed bag; some individuals were quite pleasant and outgoing, while others bordered on robotic. On the plus side, we paid about $145/night for a room in the heart of Chelsea and within a block of subway access. The beds are very comfortable.

Arrived late morning and was able to leave my bag was not able to check in --- ok because it was just past 10:30 which is understandable.. Lobby was small and bustling. Returned to check in around 7 pm that evening and had to wait around 15 minutes because there was only 1 person working the front desk at that time. Lobby was still active. Received my room key and retrieved my bag and headed up to the 17th floor. Room was diagonal from the elevator which turned out to be okay --- i did not hear 1 elevator all night. Walking into the room, I was slightly underwhelmed. The bathroom is immediately inside the door and is small with a small shelf and shower only. Bathroom was clean but some of the floor tiles were chipped and the towels could use some serious upgrading. The room itself is best described as efficient but there is not a lot of warmth. Everything was in good working order however the ottoman had a big rip right in the center, the dresser was nicked from too many run ins with luggage, and the thermostat is oddly placed over the desk. Actually, I could never tell whether the thermostat controlled the hvac unit or not. My room stayed the same temperature during my entire stay despite my adjusting the thermostat. I did like the big windows and could see the top of the Empire State building easily. I also liked that there was an extra chair for relaxing. Pros: location, comfortable bed, quiet on the 17th floor -- never heard anyone else on the floor even though the hotel was sold out, free internet (although it is wired-only in the rooms -- meh), and windows open slightly to let some air in. Cons: tired room, service seemed impersonal, could hear a lot of street noise even on the 17th floor, the reading lamps were too high over the bed, and just a generally cold vibe.

The hotel has a great location on 25th/7th. There are subway stops on 28th and 23rd Streets on the 1 line so convenient \u2013 I prefer the 23rd street stop as this is where there are a number of take a way food stores a Starbucks and a Whole Food Market it so handy for getting a drink / snack. There are stops a few minutes walk away for the C/E line at 23rd/8th and the F/M lines at 23rd/6th. There is a PATH stop at 23rd/6th too. But 34th Street for Penn Station and Macys is only a 10 minute walk away. I recommend buying a weekly fun pass ($29) I recommend the Malibu Dinner just to the left on 23rd/7th for a good honest breakfast. I arrived on a Thursday evening and left the following Wednesday. I received a warm welcome but the whole check-in process was too rushed and I had to continually ask for a piece of information to be repeated. I appreciate that check-in should be quick but going too fast makes it slower. I was told that two parcels I had been expecting had arrived so I collected them when I returned after a short trip out. I was required to sign for these parcels (don\u2019t recall having done this last year) but the process was variable (see later). At 10.00 PM I received a phone call stating that they had found two more parcels. Whilst informative I did think that this was too late a time to phone a room for something that was not urgent. Luckily I was not asleep but I did have a friend with me. I collected them the next morning. On the Monday I asked if a further parcel had been received and this was handed over without my having to sign for. However what was irritating was that this parcel has actually arrived (and had been signed for on delivery) the previous Friday yet I had not been notified. The whole signing for a parcel process is a good policy but it needs to be applied all the time. My King room on the 21st floor to the rear was a tad small (was enough for me travelling on my own and I had a larger front room last year so noticed the difference) but clean and kept clean by the friendly house keeping staff. However the view downtown was truly amazing. I left a note the first morning asking for extra coffee and towels and these were left for me every day of my stay. I also asked for a bathrobe but when this had not appeared when I returned that afternoon I asked again at the front desk only to find later on that it had been left in the wardrobe rather than the bathroom. All through my stay the bathrobe was left (folded) on either the chair or the bed but never on the hook on the bathroom door! Now what follows might seam to be a rant but these are really minor irritations that once the hotel addresses should not re-occur and improve the guest experience. At check-in I was informed that the Wall Street Journal would be delivered every day (other than Sunday) and would I like the New York Times too (as a benefit of SPG Gold). These duly arrived on the Friday and Saturday but on the Monday to Wednesday the entire floor were delivered USA Today. The WSJ and NYT were available in the lobby so no major issue but if you promise a particular service then you need to deliver it. The batteries in the safe needed replacing and despite reporting this to the front desk they were never replaced during my stay. The coffee machine etc is on a tray that is left on the shelf above the desk. However the nearest plug is on the desk itself so why not leave the tray (it is quite small) on the desk? The cord on the machine is too short to reach to the plug on the desk lamp. The free internet access is a great perk and one that many other hotels charge for but it would be good if there could be a connection on the bed side table as well as the desk for those of us who like to surf in bed. The muzak in the exterior area \u2013 WHY? It is far too loud and I would have hated to have a low floor, front room having to listen to it. Ditto the muzak in the bar / restaurant \u2013 it put me off going in for an evening drink. Light leaks \u2013 there were blinds but no black-our curtains so there was always some light leaking into the room and I do find this irritating. I also had to put a towel against the bottom of the door for the same reason. The hall lights appeared to be the same intensity 24/7 when they could be turned down during the night. The hotel booklet is very out of date and is a mix of the usual hotel info as well as tourist information yet this is all mixed up. The booklet states there are ice machines on the even floors up to twelve but then on the odd floors yet there are NO ice machines on any of the odd floors. The trip down to the 12th is not excessive but surely the booklet should be accurate? Apart from the minor irritations I enjoyed my stay and have recommended it to a number of friends.

The flat screen TV was a good touch, although I didn\u2019t spend much time watching it. I have to agree with others that the shades do not fully block the light. I was facing the street and the room was bright beginning at 7am. I found that with the windows closed I couldn\u2019t hear the usual city noises so I have no complaints about the noise. I also never heard the bar or club that others speak of\u2026 maybe because I was on the 11th floor. My room was directly outside the ice machine and I didn\u2019t hear that either.

I'm a SPG platinum member and I've stayed at this hotel dozens of times and the regular staff recognize me by face. There is no such thing as an \"upgraded\" room at this hotel cause all the rooms are basically the same. Some have old tube TV's and the newer/upgraded rooms have a flat panel. Other than that there is no difference in rooms. Many times I've checked in with a confirmed king bed reservation and all they have are double beds. As a platinum guest I should ALWAYS get my confirmed reservations regardless of capacity. I always request high floors because the windows aren't that well insulated. If you happen to get a non-street facing room, especially on a low floor, you will be bombarded by noise coming from a bar on 24th street. This bar has an outdoor back patio and the noise carries all the way to the top floor. If you happen to get a room next to an Ice Machine...then goodbye sleep. Another MISS are the pull down shades. While they look modern and trendy they don't block out any light. Good luck trying to sleep in. Once I did have a room with curtains and pull down shades and this was a slight improvement in blocking out the light. When I was there last they were upgrading/fixing the elevators. They did an upgrade to the elevators a few years earlier which resulted in a really bad wood stain on the panels and burlap type of material on the rest of the cab. Unfortunately the stain was very poor and the fabric material is worn and doesn't hold up to the daily wear and tear. Hopefully this has been fixed. Four Points provides free high speed internet, but there is no WiFi in the rooms so you have to be connected via ethernet cord. Years and years ago there used to be wifi, but they've disconnected that service. Now you do get free internet via ethernet, but I wouldn't call it High Speed. Now I don't want to be totally negative. The staff has always been friendly to me upon check-in since I'm a regular hotel guest. The location is a HIT, with close proximity to public transportation, MSG, and cool neighborhoods. The rooms are faily clean and they've \"modernized\" the bed linens to a more contemporary/clean look. This is a HUGE improvement over the previous bedding. I booked another stay for early November and I will do another posting to see if things improved. It had such bad experiences during my last stays (double bed instead of king, low floor which was noisy, voicemail light that blinked constantly even though there was no voicemail, etc) that I've been staying at the W Times Square usually at rates only $50-75 more a night which is well worth it.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Loch Sheldrake, New York", "Title": "\u201cok, far from great...\u201d", "Author": "omguru", "ReviewID": "UR80428502", "Content": "stayed for 3 nites, rooms are ultra small, basic, but beds are superior......wont stay again, since so many other choices in NYC are available.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jupiter, Fla", "Title": "\u201cVery nice\u201d", "Author": "JupiterJeff", "ReviewID": "UR79346288", "Content": "Stayed here while visiting my kids.

The bedding is comfortable and my room and bathroom were clean. Staff are VERY courteous and friendly. The staff remembered my name and greeted me each time upon seeing me. I travel frequently and that level of staff attention is hard to find, even at the luxury hotels. The down sides? The rooms are small, but I hear that's typical for NYC. There's no fridge or microwave in the rooms. If they added a fridge and microwave to the rooms, then I'd give this place five stars. Note: If you're coming from Washington DC and taking the Bolt Bus, the bus drops you off at 33rd near Madison Square.

The helpful and friendly staff other reviewers mention, I didn't really notice. Nothing wrong with them either. As a SPG Platinum member, I didn't receive really anything extra. No room upgrade, and only 250 points as amenity, despite 500 was promised during check-in. Had water and two pieces of chocolate as the gift in the room. The most annoying thing was that after the stay the usual survey came to my mailbox. Answered honestly and gave average scores. After around 30 minutes some manager from the hotel called me and wanted to know why I had not given better scores. Some could consider it a nice touch, I felt a bit pressured by him. He said he would correct my points and send me an email about discounts for future stays but I haven't seen either of them. It's not a bad hotel, I could stay there again.

I've stayed here at least four, five times already. It's in a very good location for me. Very close to Whole foods so I can pick up whatever I need there. It's next to 8th avenue so easy to grab cab to go up to Midtown for shows or shopping. I'm a SPG member so I always stayed at the higher floors. The rate is always very reasonable. Which is one of the main reason I stay at this hotel. But because it's reasonable for NYC, it also means you have to put up a few things. The hotel only has two elevators so sometimes you can be waiting for awhile for the elevator to get to you. The doors while seems substantial doesn't seem to block off sounds much. If your neighbor is talking in the hallway, you can definitely hear them. Also when they close their door, you'll definitely hear a fairly loud bang. So in a way it's kinda draw of the luck. Sometimes when I stay there, it's fairly quiet. The other times, it can be a bit loud especially if your neighbor came back from clubbing 3 o'clock in the morning. The room is nicely furnished. Some of the furniture show some sign of wear. Last time I was there, the glass shelf in the bathroom actually fell off when I put my vanity bag on top of it and I didn't even have that much stuff in the bag. But that only happened to me once from all the times I stayed here in the past so I just shrugged my shoulder and moved on. I never used their concierge service so not sure how that is. I never ate at their restaurant so again, not sure how it is. I used to live in NYC so I just need a place to park and this place is clean, reasonable and convenient so to me it's perfect.

First thing in the morning, we reported the problems and were assured all would be taken care of. We came back at about 5p and all was still the same. We called again, and the evening shift engineer arrived immediately to see what was up. He disappeared for a few minutes and popped back in with a new thermostat, new lamp and new remote. Turns out it the problem with the TV was more complicated than a bad remote; he was able to fix the TV and we were back in business. The engineer was very thankful that we reported the problems. He said the only way they know to fix these kinds of things is if ppl report the issues. He said that most ppl live with the broken/malfunctioning stuff, and end up with a less than satisfactory stay. The hotel is located between Chelsea and Flat Iron. Close by are Whole Foods (note-no fridge in room) and ClearView Cinema. Subway isn't far. For a tourist visit, the area isn't the best choice, but it suited our needs. The hotel has an affiliation with Central Parking on 26th St between 6th and Broadway. With hotel validation of the parking receipt, the cost was $25/24hrs. Our hotel experience was a 5, but location is 3- and location is very important to most visitors to NYC. So overall, I would give this hotel a 4, but only if you can get a good room rate.", "Date": "August 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "link\u00f6ping", "Title": "\u201cgreat\u201d", "Author": "billeLink_ping", "ReviewID": "UR37136557", "Content": "the best beds i have ever sleept in at a hotel. best location.", "Date": "August 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, SP", "Title": "\u201cMy 10 days at this Sheraton hotel\u201d", "Author": "Cillas", "ReviewID": "UR36759794", "Content": "This Sheraton hotel is located in the neighborhood of Chelsea on the West Side of Manhattan.

You can do better in the area. The hotel was overbooked on the night I arrived, and so they sent me to a comped room at the Hilton Garden Inn New York/Chelsea. This gave me a chance to compare the hotels, and I preferred the Hilton on every count: more professional staff, newer room with better amenities (everything from the bed linens to the bathroom toiletries), and a nice view. I could write more about the problems with this Sheraton, but let the following suffice: The reception desk was really amateurly staffed. The hallway on my floor was claustrophobic and dingy, with a ratty-looking ice machine just outside my door. The room itself was cramped and not well cleaned, the furniture was beginning to look worn, and the window (and this was a high floor) offered an ugly view onto the rear of other buildings. The worst aspect of my stay was that unfortunately the hotel did not honor the rate I booked. It had to do with the fact that, again, they overbooked my first night and had to bump me to a competitor\u2014their fault, not mine. They then were unwilling to honor the Pay 2 Nights, Stay 3 Nights promotion that I had booked. The rate and total I was charged at check-out was correct, and then\u2014unbelievably\u2014they re-adjusted my bill upward and billed a surcharge to my credit card over a week after I checked out. Of course I had never signed for the charge. I contested it afterward, but what a pain. The hotel\u2019s accountant defended the overbilling, and I decided this was one battle too many. Apparently squeezing a customer, creating ill will and bad word of mouth, was more important than providing a good customer experience.

From the moment of check-in, the desk staff were extremely helpful, asked what kind of room i would like, what floor, if we needed directions, dinner help, and even called us once we got to the room to make sure we liked it. Even later they helped us navigate the subway system and even told us what deli to go to. Room: The rooms was really small, kinda typical for NYC i guess, but we had a double on the 20th floor facing the Empire State building. The view was nice but thats about it. The beds/covers were very aged, sheets looked like they were at least 20 years old. The beds were ok, but not what you'd expect for a Sheraton. The first thing we noticed was the 19\" console TV that had no picture. About 5 minutes after calling the front desk, a maintanence guy replaced the cable, which speaks again to their excellent service. The bathroom was also \"ok\" Nice shower and very low pressure sink. Now the big negatives, the walls of the room are nearly transperant. You can hear every door close, person talk, or elevator \"ding.\" We even tried to use the exhaust fan in the bathroom to drown out the sound but had no such luck.

Even if using priceline, this hotel isn\u2019t a bargain by any means. If I had to sum up the feel of this hotel in one word it would be \u201cclaustrophobic.\u201d Location: This hotel is on a very dead side street on the border of what is supposedly Chelsea. It\u2019s a few blocks to the subway station, but it is desolate at night and quite uncomfortable to walk some of those blocks. There is nothing happening around the hotel at night and very little in the daytime. On the plus side, this means it\u2019s a quiet hotel which may suit some people. Lobby, rooms and beds: The tiny lobby in this hotel leads to immediate feelings of claustrophobia which are vastly magnified when more than five people stand in the space. The downstairs bar is also cramped. The rooms are very very small, even by NYC standards, and the tiny hallways leading to them are even more claustrophobic. Once a tray is placed outside a room, it is hard to walk around, as the hotel is so small that only a few rooms exist on each floor. Oddly, only parts of the rooms have been renovated in recent years, which means while you may be treated to a newer bed, or carpet, the furniture is bound to be of the dinged-up-cheapo-particle board variety from the 70s. This was really dismaying and gave the rooms a pretty awful aged look. Both the rooms we had were a definite mixture of old and new : Terribly old run-down duvet with many lint balls permanently attached across the surface, but relatively new sheets and mattress; Horrible marked up ancient (and ugly) furniture, but new carpet. Small ancient TVs (but at least they functioned, which is more than I can say about many a NYC hotel room). The windows in both rooms were so filthy, it was difficult to see out of the grime. On the plus side, the windows are some of the best in the city in terms of noise reduction ability. The dark d\u00e9cor in the rooms makes one feel even more imprisoned. Bathrooms: Of our two rooms, both had full renovations in tiling and sink area, but only one had a renovated shower. This was quite a contrast, as the older shower was one of those ancient sliding glass door varieties where the door doesn\u2019t quiet sit right. For those who like a bit of space around their sink area and can\u2019t deal with mini-sinks made for tiny hotel rooms, be prepared. While I quite liked the new renovated sink area and adequate toiletries, I could easily see that anyone in need of space wouldn\u2019t be able to handle these tiny bathrooms, especially the miniscule sink. Temperature control: Amazingly, they use ancient window units. Staff: The desk folks were always very friendly and helpful. Housekeeping really did a great job cleaning the rooms (not so much clearing the hallways, which were always cluttered). However, the permanent aging and staining that already existed in the rooms made it hard to get past the \u201crundown\u201d impression upon entering the room, even if it was cleaned well each day. Internet: There are free terminals and printers in a business center on the first floor, literally in the coffee bar/caf\u00e9 area of the hotel. This is a great plus if you can get on one.", "Date": "November 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Fe", "Title": "\u201cNice Stay\u201d", "Author": "birdsong", "ReviewID": "UR22065166", "Content": "My 3yr old daughter and I stayed for 2 nights at the Four Points Chelsea and had a good stay.

They had the lobby decorated for Halloween with candy bowls, etc. The lobby was not confusing at all, although the sliding doors between the vestibule and the outside are slightly offcenter, so you have to kind of walk through them diagonally. Anyway, very fast check-in, and just two blocks from the 1 and 9 redline subway at 23rd St and 7th Ave, which made getting uptown or downtown very easy. Our room was on the 9th floor I believe and was one of only a handful. Rooms are def a bit dark and modern but were very clean and we did not feel cramped at all. Bed was very comfortable and we slept well, except for the first night where we accidentally left the window cracked and the street noise could be heard. Once we shut that, it was quite noise proof. No wireless internet in the room, but they did have free wired access, so just a matter of plugging an ethernet cable into the back of the laptop. A little less convenient to be tethered to the desk, but otherwise no problem. Honestly I don't understand the problems others had with this hotel. How much time do you really spend in your room anyway when you're in NYC? The protesters have long gone, so that was not a worry either. I ran the marathon on Sunday and got a very good night's sleep on Saturday night in the comfortable bed. Shower is a bit modern in that it is only separated from the rest of the bathroom floor by the curtain. Again, not a major inconvenience, more a modern style detail. Bathroom was clean, as was the rest of the room. Very little waiting for elevators which is a nice aspect in smaller boutique hotels like this one. Would definitely stay here again for the proximity to the subway and cleanliness and friendly staff. There is a Whole Foods Market around the corner on 7th which was open late on Sunday night with a plethora of great food. We ate at a fantastic Barbeque joint called Righteous Urban Barbeque on 23rd, also just a short walk. Great brisket sandwhich and empanadas. There was also a great affordable Mexican Restaurant and a 24 hour Chelsea Diner on 23rd with awesome burgers. Also worth checking out on 23rd is Trailer Park.

I just have a thing about sleeping in questionable sheets so this is my habit whenever I travel. It gives me a peaceful night's sleep. The room itself was small, but we expected this for NYC. I thought they did a nice job of giving you storage though. We unpacked and each had 1 drawer (3 total). We also hung up some clothes in the closet and used the shelf above the desk and the desk for additional storage. It worked just fine. I thought the hotel was clean and the beds were comfy. The bathroom was decent size and the shower had good hot water & water pressure. We always had plenty of towels and our room was cleaned well and in a timely manner daily.

We all chose the full breakfast which included 2 eggs, toast, 3 pieces of bacon and hash browns and drinks (fill yourself - juice, coffee, water, milk, etc.).

The only sign of any protesting was 2 banners hung on the building across from our window that said something about Four Points not following Federal Labor Laws. I thought the hotel was relatively quiet. The only noises we really heard were the nightly garbage trucks and our noisy neighbors who came in 1 night drunk at 4am.

The room could have been cleaner. The carpet wasn't well vaccumed either of the days I was there. I tested this by leaving the crumbs I found in the spot they were found in. Still there after I checked out. The sheets on one of the beds had some funky stains on them. The room was dusty too. For the love I can't understand why the bathroom did not have a soap dish. It was very strange. The bathroom itself was a pretty good size and the shower was fine. There was room for a soap dish, but alas... I called the front desk around midnight for new pillows - ones that weren't down. I couldn't reach anyone in housekeeping and after about 10 rings the front desk the woman hurriedly answered and asked if she could call me back in a minute. I said sure. After 45 minutes I got tired of waiting and called her back to ask for some non-down pillows that I wouldn't be allergic to. She apologized for not calling me back and someone came up right away.

As it was kind of our honeymoon trip, they gave a breakfast for free which was a nice gesture. Picketing was still ongoing, but the picketers were cramped behind a fence a little aside, still being very loud and having a video camera set up filming the entrance and a giant rat (about 4 meters high) with them which is quite an odd look to have in front of a hotel. We have not been insulted, but being yelled at very loudly when entering or leaving the hotel which we simply ignored. The whole thing is about employee health insurance which - according to the picketers - is not being paid for by the hotel as others do. The hotel says the picketers are not liable for the hotel staff which anyway would have no complaints. The truth - as always - seems to be somewhere in the middle. Expect the picketing in the morning and in the late afternoon. Definitely ask for a room on the backside of the hotel. So, besides that annoying little fact, what can be said about the Four Points? Well, expect a Starwood hotel, but don't expect it to be like other Starwood places. You can sure earn as well as redeem Starpoints which we did, but that's pretty much it. The crew at the front desk is kind of unwilling and surprised me with some astonishing helplessness. We ordered broadway tickets and needed some help - not that much helpfull. Ordering a limousine to the airport (53 dollars + toll) with from a different agency than they cooparate with (75 dollars + toll)? Not possible, not willing, whatever\u2026 No bathrobe or slippers are provided and don't expect to be upgraded even if you are SPG Platinum. The rooms \"all have pretty much the same size\" and only very few higher class.

I was very organized with my group and provided a spreadsheet with confirmation numbers and the room reservation name it should be under to make this process quick and simple.

He just randomly placed people in rooms! So wrong charges were incurred on credit cards and wrong rates, wrong reservation name, etc. etc. During our stay we had a pretty unpleasant stay.

She gave up on all the moving, and dealing with everything else; we wanted to enjoy our stay in the city because it was such a short trip to begin with!

The guy at the desk did NOTHING! I saw him go to the window, look, and then go back to whatever he was doing. We were horrified because we could have been seriously injured by this.

My loved one said it wasn't a big deal until I asked her to go into the room, close the door, and I then pushed the button for ice.

They wanted $3 for a simple coffee. I told the guy I was only going to have half a cup anyway, so he let it go, \"Just this one time\" he scolded. Seriously, for rooms starting at $225 a night, they can't have complementary coffee in the lobby or restaurant? Summary, go there, it's nice, clean, relatively cheap for NYC, no pool, gym, good service and nice staff.

Not knowing NYC, I wasn't about to stroll about in the dead of night. SInce there was no mini bar, I really was out of luck.

The location couldnt be beat, it seemed it only cost around $6 in a taxi to anywhere we wanted to go and all of the trains and buses also go right near by. The lobby was well air conditioned much to our immediate relief as it was muggy and sticky outside. The staff was extremely well trained. We checked in and were told that there were no more king rooms left due to the Pride festival going on that week. I replied, firm yet polite, that our rate was for a king room that was confirmed over a month ago and if they wanted to give us a double room they should adjust the price downward because on the internet these rooms were less expensive. After some chatting with co-workers about the situation both there in front of us and on the walkie talkie we were given a suite on the top floor! I was so pleased, I tried to tip Lisa Lew (the front desk person) but she would not accept it. :) We saw the bar but did not drink there, but it was lit up like something in Sex and the City or Queer as Folk. Very chic. The staff always asked if there was anything they could do for us when they saw us in the lobby, as if it were part of their greeting. The room was great! There was a balcony overlooking the empire state building! The balcony was shared by the suite next door, but we never saw them or heard them. It would be fun to get the two suites and have a nice party! Nothing over the top mind you, just a nice party and fun in the city. There was a leather love seat that folded out to a bed, a chair for the desk and another comfy chair and a tv in the living room. In the Bedroom was a luxurious king bed with it seemed like hundreds of pillows and another view of the empire state building. There was a 40 inch flat screen plazma tv on an extension bracket that brought the tv almost right over the bed! Excellent to wind down at night with. It looked exactly like the pictures of the suite on their website, but we did not pay the suite price at all! The place was spotlessly clean (even my mother would have liked it!) and the bathroom was huge by NYC standards. We have travelled the world and this suite was holding its own in comparison. The walls were so thick between rooms that when I was out in the hallway I could hear the people in the next suite being very loud, but in our room at all. Let me tell you, the fun we had on the pier was extended to the suite aftward. No one from the hotel ever bothered us or intruded on our privacy. I could not hear the cleaning service at all in the morning and that one thing is a personal pet peeve of mine because I cannot stand the sound of a vacuum in the morning time. I am a pretty picky traveller and I was pleased 100%. Ice was on every other floor and easy to get to. The front desk offered a mini fridge but we didnt really need it. I personally never heard a sound from outside of our suite, but I wouldnt want the room next to the ice machine. There were vending machines somewhere but we had the city to get our snacks from!

The rooms we very stylishly appointed with dark cooper-brown wallpaper and black & white photos of machines. (A mechanical motif runs throughout the hotel.) The rooms had a cool, dark relaxing atmosphere, which was greatly appreciated at the end of a hot New York day. The furniture placement made good use of limited space. There was a desk, dresser and wardrobe with ample room for clothes. But it was the beds (2 doubles) that won me over -- comfortable, inviting and loaded with pillows. It rivaled some of the beds in higher-end hotels. Maybe a little of the heavenliness of the Uncle Westin\u2019s Heavenly Beds have been incorporated into the Four Points product line. I don't know for certain, but I found them to be just as heavenly. The bath, surprisingly, had a full size shower with the shower head mounted at good six feet or more on the wall. Ask any tall person and they'll tell you how that little attention to detail makes a big difference. The bath was also stocked with unique herbal-based product -- no cheesy French milled soap or brand name sample shampoo. The room and bath were both immaculate! A little aromatherapy really added to the boutique feel, but it was little overpowering at times. If you\u2019re sensitive to those type things, you might want to warn them before check-in. Add to all of this a courteous and efficient staff, and you have a nice \"neighborhood\u201d hotel \u2013 away from the hustle and bustle of Time Square, but close enough to everything. Now we get to the matter of price. The Four Points is one of the many mid-range hotels that have been popping up in Manhattan as lower price alternatives to the big name luxury hotels. However, some of these hotels can still pack a punch on your wallet, so shop around. If you can get rates below $250 at the Four Points, you're doing well, and you will be pleasantly surprised.

The staff was quite helpful and friendly. We were a bit dissappointed however as we are SPG Gold members and although we were upgraded to a higher floor, we were given the smallest room on the floor. If you are given the --07 room, there is a cut-out for the service closet and the ice machine. The room was so small, we were unable to open the door or armoir without hitting another piece of furniture. I'm also convinced it was a queen rather than king bed that was advertised. When we asked one individual, we were told they were all exactly the same size and he was unwilling to switch us. If you look on room chart however, it was obvious this was a smaller space. That was the only person who was unwilling to do all that he could for us the whole weekend. We found the place to be clean but the furniture was worn and chipped (probably from having to sidestep your way round the bed). The beds were very comfortable and the shower pressure was good. The bathroom layout offered no counterspace so no place to place, electric razors, blowdryers or makeup without fearing they would fall into the sink or toilet. We had to ask that the cleaning staff not chat in the hallway near the service closet since the sound through the doors defintitely carried but it never happened again.

The staff was very quick and always had a good morning or good evening for us. They were frioendly and helpful with all that we needed and there always were lots of people working. The asian style restuarant and bar was a nice touch as well. We had drinks at the bar and visited with Benny the bartender who gave us some shopping and sightseeing tips. I recommend that you try out a New York Deli called \"TOASTIES\" on 7th ave between 23 and 24th streets. They make amazing sandwiches and huge salads, everything was fresh and tasted great. If you are looking for a close restaurant for a nice dinner try \"Orchid\" &/or \"Rogue\" located on 6th Ave between 25th & 26th street. They seemd to be operated by the same people and the menus are both similar but the service was good and the atmosphere was great at both of them (Orchid was a bit more trendy and personal while Rogue more sporty). The hotel is within walking distance to most tourist areas with the exception of Ground Zero, Financial District, Fish Market, and Statue of Liberty/Statton Island Ferry. Taxis only cost about $7-10 to all of these areas from the hotel. If you want to do the tourist thing be sure to get a 48 hour hop on hop off double decker bus pass from Grayline.
