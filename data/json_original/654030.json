Being a Starwood Rewards member we booked a room at the Westin San Francisco Market Street for the night. Also being a Hilton Honors Diamond member I was expecting a less than ordinary welcome and possibly something special considering I had informed them of the nature of our stay. We got nothing! Not that I was expecting much, but even a piece of chocolate and a \"Happy Birthday\" message would have been appreciated. We were given a $15 drink credit at the bar, which pretty much afforded us one glass of \"cheap\" wine. All in all, this hotel is okay if you need a quick place to stay in San Francisco.

The hotel itself has a very luxurious feel. The lobby is well decorated and rooms are well appointed. The room was spacious, full of light, and had all of the amenities you would expect at hotel of this class. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable, something that I find very important and often supbar, even at luxury hotels. I did not have time to see the gym, so I can't comment on that, but they had rental excercise gear from new balance, which I thought was a good idea. The location is excellent and was right in the middle of everything. I was there for 4 nights for a conference at Moscone, which was literally a 2 minute walk. I did have a day to explore the city, so being in the middle of everything and next to the T (subway) was helpful. As far as food, I didn't eat at the hotel bar/restaurant. However, the caliber of restaurants within walking distance was impressive. The best part was the service. I was first greated by Rocelyn (I think that was her name) who was very curteous and helpfull. Everyone I talked to had a smile on, which was nice. One day it was really pouring (big surprise in SF), and I was surpirsed that as I was leaving in my suit they offered me a loaner umbrella to take with me. Never had that happen at a hotel before!

My one disappointment is that because of a change in plans, I needed to cancl my last night and at check-in, asked if the reservation could be changed to the Westin at SFO. Although there was no penalty to do so, she said that \"the systems were not linked\" and I would have to make the change myself. As a consolation, she said, airport hotels are usually much cheaper. Unfortunately, after many tries to get through to the Westin SFO, the rate rate was actually about $100 MORE than I was paying ($379 vs $279).

Staff: was excellent; requested a high floor, which I didn't necessarily get (17 of 30something), but it was high enough. Requested a king away from the elevator, which I did get. Used the concierge a couple times, who were very helpful. Needed a 6 passenger cab for transport to the airport, which was easily arranged with the doorman (though plan ahead). Cleaning staff were all friendly. Room: considering the price, $311/night, I've stayed in nicer rooms at that price. Bathroom was pretty small. Had a large king bed, which was extremely comfortable. Full sized desk as well as another chair next to the bed. Large flat screen TV was nice, but due to the shape of the room, was kind of in an awkward position to watch from bed. Room had plenty of plugs for cell/laptop/iPad chargers. Closet was a little small, as well as the storage for clothes (for those of us who like to unpack). Not a huge fan of the Westin brand toiletries--but that's the same at all their hotels (W stuff is much better). The room I had was a pretty nice location; very end of the hall, almost a corner-type room, with a view of the bay. It was right next to the ice machine, but I NEVER heard it. Food: didn't eat in the hotel a single time, though friends who did use the restaurant said it was very good. Misc: The gym is average. Not very large. At one time, there were 10+ people there, and it was way too crowded. I did see signs about Westin clients being able to use the gym at the Four Seasons, but I didn't investigate this. It should be noted, the elevators were extremely fast. The hotel was crowded, there are tons of rooms, yet I never felt I had to wait for an elevator. Overall, the place was clean, staff was awesome and accommodating, and the Westin bed is very nice to sleep in when spending such a long time in a hotel room.

Check in was prompt and efficient and I was given an upgrade to an available suite, which was great. The room was clean and quiet and had really nice views of San Francisco. There were large flat panel televisions in both the sitting room and the bedroom. Westin has recently changed to a new television interface that is nice, but a little laggy.

Previously the gym was adequate, but nothing special. Not sure if it has changed or not this time around. The doorman was friendly and efficient, and I did use their car service back to the airport.

No problem if you are waiting for towels, but if you need serious help, (security or health) they will NOT answer if they are taking service requests. You don't ring-through, or even connect to voice mail. Women traveling alone looking for a good hotel need to consider what happened to me. My first night I woke at 11:30 to clicking noises at my door then knocking. I went to the peephole, the person was gone. Second incident same thing, nobody visible. 3rd time I realize a disturbed person was knocking on my adjoinging door that attaches to his room. He periodically knocked, then started whistling through the crack in our door. I called express service,, rang off the hook. (FYI,,, I was told by the staff dialing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153O\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd uses the same phone line.) To be 100% accurate, after the fact, they said my only other choice was to dial 7005 the front desk. Try to imagine yourself as a new guest knowing this # at midnight in the dark I dressed to go to the lobby, gave the phone another try, got right through. A second-string guy arrived in room service attire, said the security guy was handling another matter. (interesting!) I was told CALL IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN. I told him he didn't get it,,, the guy was repeatedly knocking on my adjoining door, not my hall door. The creep knocked again while the room service guy was there, now my credibility can't be questioned. The room service guy knocked on the this guys door for over a minute, no success. I had to personally call this fella on my phone and demand he come out and get this resolved. The low-life opened, denied doing anything till I told him the room service guy was my witness. He admitted it all. My real issue is the next day. The guy wasn't moved, I was told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don't worry he can't get in\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Go back to sleep with that thought ladies. I am a guy, I was prepared to handle a repeat incident Jersey Style (joke) but my daughter and wife who travel alone on business will never stay here with this policy.

COMMON SENSE tells anyone a follow-up call to me was warranted with his findings and corrective action taken. I was there 3 additional days, plenty of time to find me. All 3 days I was politely told I could talk to him \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if you want\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Decide for yourself if this type of attitude brought change. The point Mr -- doesn't get is that by turning his cowardly head, word has gotten out to people similar to my neighbor, that this behavior at this particular Westin is tolerated, they need their business. If guests don't take charge they will look the other way. The staff are fine, but Mr -- trained employees to say he is available \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if you want\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

There was a problem with the fridge (it was very loud and there was a lot of water in it). I could go on, but let's just say it didn't seem like a four-star hotel. My brother stayed in a different room for a night and said that his was pretty run-down too. What irritated me most was the internet service. It is outrageously expensive. I travel a lot and I don't believe I have paid so much for internet for at least five years. Also, it took at a few hours to get the internet working. I ended up on the phone to a call center somewhere because no one at the hotel can deal with internet. I couldn't use my laptop on the bed. I had to sit at the desk because the cable doesn't stretch far and there were ZERO power outlets anywhere in the room except right at the desk. It is hard to get hold of staff members. Check-in took forever and the lines were so long for the concierge that we gave up. We couldn't get through to the hotel at all by phone before checking in and we tried for several hours. The general atmosphere is of a crash-pad for corporate types. My guess is that these people are on company expense accounts and probably don't care so much about the overall quality of the experience. There are other four-star-ish hotels close by and I have stayed at a couple of them in the past. My advice is to look elsewhere.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monterrey, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cExcellent in every way!\u201d", "Author": "nellymty", "ReviewID": "UR123502939", "Content": "We have previously visit San Francisco and this time we decided to stay in a hotel closer to MArket st so I read a few reviews and decided for this one.

United Airlines delayed the flight from LA to San Francisco for 4 hours. We're hungry and stuck in Ontario airport where the entire food court smelled of rotton cheese, which they apparently put on their burritos. \"Jane\" the UA flight person reminded me of the character from \"Meet the Parents\", that Ben Stiller's character encounters in the airport. Although there are no other passengers around, she insists on using the speaker phone, telling him to please step back, as she calls out non-existant customers to come forward and present their ticket, as Stiller waits, frustrated and mystified. I started laughing a little bit hysterically when I reminded my husband of the scene from the movie. He pretended that he didn't know me. The United Airlines (flight 6350, January 20) plane smells like vomit, c'mon United Airlines, heard of air freshner or even better, cleaning? By the time we landed, my husband and I both agreed to drive from now on, in our comfortable Range Rover. It wouldn't have taken any longer. And we wouldn't have been subjected to the indignities of over-zealous TSA agents. We arrived at the Westin, to face a long line at the front desk. When we finally got to the counter, we asked if it would be possible to extend our trip by a day. The man behind the desk said, \"Yes, there is availablity but I don't know what your rate will be, can I help you with anything else?\" Clearly, he wanted us to move along. Odd, one would think that if a hotel has availablity and people wanting to stay there, they would be helpful in making these arrangements. On our way to the elevator, the bellman moved around us and pushed onto the elevator with a full trolley of suitcases. No one had offered to help us with ours. I pointedly said to him, \"You go on ahead, we'll get the next one.\" Customer service NOT! When we got to our room, the keys didn't work so we schlepped back down and faced an even longer line at the front desk. The same guy told us that the keys did work, we just didn't do it properly. Nevertheless, he re-keyed them and they worked the second time around. I was hoping to find lotion in the room for my bath, it's such a hassle to pack nowadays. No lotion or shampoo. Just bath gel. Our room on the 10th floor is right beside the ice machine, which crashes a load of ice every now and then during the night, waking my husband up. I'm a heavy sleeper. The heating and air-conditioning are not quiet either, whooshing on and off during the night. Because it was raining we decided to go to the Ducca bar for happy hour and were hoping to stay in for dinner. The only free table had bright spot lights trained in our eyes. I wanted a nice glass of red wine. The waiter said the wine being served for happy hour was so-so Merlot. (Begging the question, why serve it?) This is wine country, we expect more. We ordered a lemon drop and appletini. They were the worst cocktails we'd ever drunk. I complained (my husband is too nice to complain) and they actually took my drink off the final bill. We ordered 2 of the specialty drinks and they were very good -- Pomology (a pomogranite mojito) and Acai apple crisp. We decided to order brushetta, and I told our waiter we would decide whether or not to eat at the restuarant based on whether we liked the brushetta. The brushetta was delicious although the bread it came on was nearly hard enough to break your teeth. We ordered some crab cakes and an onion tart. They were okay, but not worth a trip to the restaurant we decided so we saved some calories and went to bed, deciding to go out to one of our favorite SF restaurants the following night. Because there was no coffee service in the room, I headed over to Starbucks the next morning. When I returned to the hotel, I called to make a reservation for the night. The price shot up more than $100, but the room & view are also beautiful on the 31st floor. The beds are divinely comfortable and the rooms are clean and tastefully decorated. And rooms on the 31st floor do have coffee service. I spent the day shopping while my husband was in meetings. Got a little turned around thanks to directions given by well-meaning but incorrect strangers, including a motor-cycle cop. When I attempted to call the hotel on 411, it turns out not to be listed. Spent a frustrating hour and a half, trying to find it. The other Westin on Powell street was not very helpful when I called for information, yelling at me for entering the number in my phone as they gave it to me, because it made too much noise and hurt their ears. By the time I finally got back to the hotel I wasn't happy. I went to the reception desk, where the same guy was who had checked us in was working. I told him it wasn't possible to get the Westin on Market Street through 411. He mumbled something about that not being correct. So I put my phone on speaker and dialed 411, so that I could prove that I was right. He just stared at me and didn't say anything. So I came upstairs and called the hotel manager and told her what had happened. She sent up a complimentary tray with lovely cheese and the same so so wine they were serving last night at happy hour. Tonight my husband and I are grumpy. United Airlines called to say our afternoon flight has been cancelled so we have to leave in the morning at 7:15 a.m. I wish I hadn't come on this trip. I want a little pampering when I'm away from home. We were hoping for a nice time. When customer service isn't good, it's a reflection on the management. Maybe they aren't paying their employees well enough or perhaps they aren't nice to their employees.

It's quite a ways off to things like Alcatraz and the Golden Gate bridge, but you can make them out way off in the distance, which is cool -- assuming it's not foggy! Having the fog roll in an actually be below the level of the windows, between you and the buildings even across the street was actually kind of neat as well. The neiighborhood is OK, with lots of shopping, including both regular stores along Market Street and other roads, shopping malls, plus Union Square (including Karakter, which has Tintin merchandise!). There are both upscale places to eat, some connected to the malls, plus regular places like a Quiznos right next door, a 24-hour Subway restaurant and a California Pizza Kitchen right across the street, etc. There's a cable car turnaround a short walk down Market Street, or you can also grab the F-trolley even closer, which will take you right down to Fisherman's Wharf, etc. Hotel staff was nice, and helpful.

Unfortunately, this stay has been no better than previous ones. When I came through San Francisco recently, I stayed at a hotel in China town (SW Hotel) that is marketed as fairly affordable. I should have gone back there! It was much cleaner, better-staffed, and the internet was much more reliable than at the Westin. On the plus side, the location is great and the bed is extremely comfortable. I stayed here because I had an online meeting with colleagues overseas and when I made the booking from overseas, I chose a hotel that I knew had internet. I specified during booking that I would need a working internet connection. When I arrived at my room, the connection didn't work (this has happened on all but one of the previous four stays I've had at the Westin). Also, it costs a considerable amount. There is no one at the hotel who can deal with internet issues, so I had to call an outside company. They couldn't fix the problem and didn't call back. Finally I was transferred to a different room. The internet did work, but the room was dirty. There were nasty stains on the wall in the bathroom, on the carpet, on the curtains. The bathroom floor hadn't been cleaned. The furniture was quite run down. These are issues I have noticed on previous stays at this hotel. I called in advance to confirm my booking (a lesson learned from previous stays at this hotel) and no one picked up the phone for two days. Sure enough, there was no record of my booking. The bottom line is that this is a hotel that skimps on staff. Overall, it took about four hours to deal with the internet and booking problems. Add another half hour to check out because reception is understaffed. The rooms are just not up to the kind of standard that one would expect for this kind of hotel.

Again, the passenger seat which should not have been occupied had been moved and there was women's hair in the vehicle. To our knowledge there were no women on the valet staff. We decided to look over the car and we discovered that our bumper had been SIGNIFICANTLY DAMAGED. Many DEEP SCRATCHES, GOUGES, AND MISSING PAINT. We notified the Valet Manager and he pulled out this claim ticket with the outline of a vehicle pointing out that someone had marked scratches on the bumper.

I had called the hotel to see about early check in and they managed to get us a room even arriving at the hotel at 10:30am. I was impressed. When we got up to the room, the safe was locked from the previous guest. I phoned down and they said they were going to send someone up right away. 40 minutes later and two more calls and we had our safe open. We went down and used the Concierge where a very rude woman gave us a rushed set of directions that turned out to be false. We went out about our day and came back around 4pm. We quickly realized why this room was available. Every so often we would hear a loud bang right next to the room. Turns out the service elevators were right beside our room and the carts would bang loudly when coming on and off the elevator. While we were in the room, a couple moved into the room on the other side of us. There was a common door between the rooms and not only could I hear her talking on the phone, I could hear the person talking to her on the phone. I was not impressed. I complained and the hotel staff upgraded our room and gave me a free breakfast. Strange to give one breakfast when there was two of us but I was back to impressed. The upgraded room had a much better view. The old room had one floor to ceiling window but the new room had two floor to ceiling windows that were facing more of the Bay. Bed was very comfortable but the rest of the room was not up to expectations. The bath room had a dual showerhead but only one of them would stay in place. The other was too loose and could not be directed. The seat and ottoman in the room had stains on them. When checking out, I went to the business centre to print off our boarding passes. You can do that for free which was great. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t print however. I called the tech support number and they said I needed to talk to the Concierge. When I called the lobby, they also told me I needed to get the Concierge to print off the passes because the hotel actually doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t own the business centre and they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allowed to touch them.

I shouldn't have as the check in process was smooth and upgrade was offered without having to request it. Hotel is close to SFO airport.

Beds were amazing and very comfortable to sleep in. There is a gym, which has all the necessary equipment, but it's nothing to write home about. However, Westin partnered up with Four Seasons to provide daily gym passes ($27/day). FS gym description looked awesome. There were several small annoyances, but the management fixed them all (some sooner, some later). 1) TV. Sound worked fine, but there was no video. We complained several times, and hotel promised to send an engineer to fix the problem, but he never showed up. Manager was apologetic about the problem and offered 2500 SPG points as compensation. 2) Internet fee ($15/day). Is it really necessary to charge $15/day internet fee in this day and age? I complained and the charge disappeared from the final bill. YMMV. 3) Aggressive maids. I think they started banging on the door each morning at 8am. As I mentioned before, all the issues were solved (I wonder if Gold SPG status mattered?) and I received several emails from different managers making sure everything was OK.

Let me start by saying the first lady we encountered at the front desk was extremely friendly and did her best to make us feel as welcome as possible. She even gave us 2 vouchers for breakfast the next morning. It basically goes downhill from there. The first night we were in a corner room. Extremely small room shaped like a V, with an even smaller bathroom. Although be view was ok, definitely not worth it on the lower floors. The next day they moved us to a Starwood preferred guest floor with a king size bed. The room was a little roomier, with a desk, and 42\" LCD TV. The bathroom was a normal size, but no big by any stretch. The room seemed very dated, like it hasn't been renovated in about 15years. The bathroom much the same, not what I expect from a Westin charging upwards of over $300. The sad part is they only gave 2 towels, and 1 piece of soap, again not what I expect for $300 a night. The other things that I find sad is that such an expensive hotel really rapes you when it comes to parking and internet. Internet is about $15/day, and parking is nearly $50 a day, more expensive than the rental car itself. If you are smart, you will park in the parking garage across the street where the parking is $21/day. Using the 1 complimentary breakfast voucher we got, I did enjoy the breakfast buffet at Ducca. The buffet is huge with a large assortment of food and drinks. The other nice thing about the hotel is it is center to all the downtown activities. Moscone center is only 2 blocks away. There is a great breakfast place call The Grove, across the street. There are a multitude of restaurants in the surrounding area. Overall, will likely not stay here again when in SF. If it was $100-150, it would be acceptable.

A week before arriving, I contacted Westin Market Street's reservation coordinator and confirmed a king room for my wife and I. The reservation coordinator was very friendly in the emails, and I assumed everything would be fine. Upon arrival, we were checked in and assured it was a king room, and we left our bags in the room without inspecting it as we were in a rush. That evening, I realised that it was a handicapped-access room with a single queen bed. I called up front desk, and they said, yes, we were checked into a single queen room, and no king rooms were available for us. So, fine, we squeezed for one night. We requested to shift to a king room the second night, but only by quoting the name of the reservation coordinator was front desk willing to shift us to a king room. No apology was made as to the mistake with the reservation, nor any service recovery attempted. While I do understand mistakes happen, and hotels do get overbooked, the least I expect is an explanation, smile and apology. None of that was recieved. On a side note, the toilet in the king room was tiny. The door barely misses the water closet on closing. The bed was great, though. Also, the concierge came across as arrogant as well when asked for commuting advice. Expensive wifi and parking charges is another minus. The hotel was otherwise great, with nicely furnished rooms in a good location, but the poor service and snobbish attitude of the frontline staff was unacceptable. A huge pity, as it could have been an excellent stay otherwise. I booked my stay through travelocity, and I suspect thats why we received such poor treatment.

This Westin is in a great location of San Francisco, near the cable car turnaround and a short walk to Chinatown and North Beach.

Guest room styling is accurately represented on the hotel's website, though some room features were a bit worn (oye, why equip hotel rooms with white-fabric armchairs unless you can commit to keeping them clean?) and the iPod docking station had a broken button. If a room with a view is important to you, you'll appreciate that this hotel building is triangle-shaped, so nearly every room faces out to a part of the city. (Many rooms at even the nicer San Francisco hotels face inward toward other rooms or a secondary roof with duct work, for example.) Front-desk staff were friendly and efficient; when a longer check-in line formed, a manager noticed and offered us water while we waited the few extra minutes. Bar staff were disinterested and did the minimum. When staying in San Francisco, this Yerba Buena Gardens/slightly South of Market area is one of the two best areas in which to be based (the other is Union Square/Nob Hill)... but note that several outstanding hotels exist on the same turf.

We stayed there for seven nights, which proved to be long enough. the good points: The beds are VERY comfortable. That is one of the big reasons we stayed there, we knew we would be there for a week and did not want to get stuck sleeping on a crappy bed. We have a tempurpedic mattress at home and the \"Heavenly\" bed at the Westin was excellent. It is in a very location if you want to see San Francisco. it is on a Third St., a stones throw from Market St., the buses and streetcars, and a short walk from the BART and the Powell and Hyde cable car turn around. It is a short walk to the other attractions in that area, Chinatown and Union Square, the MOMA and many others. The Staff was over all very helpful and professional. We called guest services to request a refrigerator for our room, and it was delivered to our room in less then ten minutes. The room was very clean and we found there to be plenty of room for two people for a week. The floor to ceiling window did give a very cool view out into the city. Now the not so good: It is in the heart of the city, good if you want to have easy access to things, not so good if you need some quiet. The room is not sound proofed so you can hear the street and it's busy all night. We could not get the internet to work. It worked everywhere else in the city, just not in the hotel. The WIFI would not let us connect and the hardline network cable would not either. Their internet and entertainment is managed by Lodgenet (they are used widely in the Hotel industry) and we called their help desk to try to resolve this issue. The person we spoke to could not help, so our ticket was escalated to a tier 2 representative and we were told that we would receive a call back shortly.....it never came. We waited for two days and our call was never returned. We called back and got no where. I went to the front desk and tried to get someone who could help and they told me that the IT person is not in the weekend. So I got nowhere with this problem. All this and they charge you 15 dollars a day for the service. (we did not connect, so we did not have to pay) It would seem that like a minor problem if it were not for three factors: My wife and I were going to be stranded there for five days due to Hurricane Irene having disrupted so many flights including ours to Boston, and my wife needed to work remotely the following week. I had an online class that I had to attend on the following Monday. The Westin is a business hotel, they should not have these kind of issues.

It is in a pretty good location to the downtown amenities and to the transportation system. Unfortunately that is really the only thing I really liked about the hotel. I found the staff to be very rude and not willing to help. The concierge didn't give proper directions (which in turn sent us on a bit of a wild goose chase to our destination), and did not really want to look up the answers to some other questions I had. The valet and greeting staff were gruff and brushed us off when we asked for a recommendation for a quick bite to eat in the area. They never said good morning or went out of their way to be friendly. From staying at other Westins I know this isn't usually the case. As well, the men at the baggage counter were rude to my mom when she asked a quick question about the Giants. Granted they may not be Giants fans but hey, at least be a little more polite to your customers. The staff in Ducca were no better. It took 15 minutes for us to be asked what we would like to drink on our first night at the lounge. Against our better judgement, we went back to the restaurant for breakfast a few mornings later. The service was terrible, we ended up pouring our own coffee refills because we weren't given a carafe like the other tables (not sure why when they also ordered the same things we did) and the server never came to check on us. The carafe finally came when we were ready to pay our bill. The breakfast in Ducca was extremely disappointing. We chose the buffet and a lot of the food was cold, a day old or just not good (the eggs were powdered). As well, the appetizer plate we ordered at the bar was not complete (it only had about 3/4 of the items on it that were indicated on the menu). Internet cost $14.95 a day. We bought it one day, but the connection was horrible; we kept getting kicked off the system. We were also told that we could print our boarding passes for free in the business center. When we tried to however, the computer didn't recognize our airline so we had to pay to print them. When we mentioned it to the concierge, she nonchalantly told us she could have done it for us, but too bad we didn't ask. Our room was ok, but not what I expect from the Westin. There were lots of hand prints on the window, an odd big blue spot on the ceiling (it looked like shower gel or something had exploded) and a blood spot on one of the bed skirts. It was tidy but not overly clean. You could tell the floor hadn't been vacuumed under the beds or in the corners in a while. Unfortunately I wouldn't stay here again, especially for the price.

We arrived late morning and our room was not ready, but we did not expect it to be. We booked our trip through Expedia and paid for the lowest double queen we could get which meant we would be on the lower floors. When our room was still not ready at 2 pm, they offered us a room on a higher floor so we didn't have to continue waiting. We were on the 12 th floor which still gave us a nice view out the back of the hotel. We chose this hotel because of some of the hotel's features and it's location. We were not disappointed. The room was spacious enough for 2 adults and 2 teenagers. The bathroom was small, but we managed just fine. The beds were very comfortable and we really like the floor to ceiling window. Our daughter used the fitness center and said each machine had it's own tv which she really liked. There is a refrigerator in the room, but you can't really use it because it is filled with the hotel beverages that they want you to buy. If you move them, the sensor will make you pay for something you don't want, so we were not able to keep our own drinks or food cold. You do not need a car to do anything within the city from this location. You can walk to shopping, restaurants, Chinatown, AT&T ballpark. We took the cable car to The Fisherman's Wharf area, and the bus system to Golden Gate Park. We did rent a car for 3 days...also within walking distance of the hotel. We used the car to go to areas outside of the city...Sonata/Napa, Carmel, and a soccer game in Santa Clara. At night we parked the car at an indoor lot across the street from the hotel which cost a max of $23/day. It is very easy and secure, so unless you are coming for a business trip where your company is paying for parking, or you just insist that you need valet parking, I would suggest you do not park at the hotel for $48...it really is a waste of your money. The concierge service was wonderful. They not only had maps and brochures for various tours, but they took the time to map things out for us, explain the transportation system, and answer any questions we had. The hotel secured our luggage for us when we had to check out before leaving for our flight home. They also made sure we got a cab to the airport. Cabs are very easy to get outside the hotel, and the rates are very good. For four people, we actually found it cheaper to take a cab places than using the cable car system! Many of the streets in the city are one way (including the street the hotel is located on)...just keep that in mind if you plan to drive yourself around the city. We never used the hotel Internet service because we didn't want to pay extra for it, but there are many restaurants near the hotel that have free Internet access, including a Starbuck on the corner, and Mel's Diner, a couple blocks await. It is a shame that the hotel doesn't have free Internet, but we were aware of that when we booked the trip.

As with most Starwood properties, service is excellent from the front desk to housekeeping. The Ducca restaurant off the lobby serves good food with friendly, efficient service. The same can be said of the lobby bar, though the prices seem a bit high for their drinks. Just outside the bar is a terrific garden area with tables and seating and trees and shrubs. It's a rarity to be able to take your drinks/food outside to a quiet, relaxing urban garden in this part of the city. All in all, this is a comfortable and clean hotel. The location is excellent. Just a block to BART, and a short walk to Union Square, etc. As with all downtown SF hotels, parking space is at a premium and the hotel charges a stiff fee for overnight parking.

The room itself was a great size, with good views across the city. The bed was really comfortable and large. On the flip side, the bathroom was really small and did not compare to facilities available in other starwood hotels, i.e. toilet right next to the bath and the shower being over the bath. Whilst overall the room and bathroom were very clean there were some minor points in the bathroom, like long hair on the floor and a towel and a toenail clipping on the bathroom floor. There were a couple of other minor points which took the shine off the hotel, only having two starbucks teabags and one portion of coffee in the room together with the water bottles in the room being complimentary only on the first day. Add in the lack of free wi-fi or free/cheap internet in business centre and you feel a bit cheated for a hotel of this star rating. Like another reviewer, we were also almost charged for a bottle of wine in the mini-bar which we did not consume. This charge was taken off the account with little fuss by staff. Some other reviewers have commented on the noise, which is a little surprising. This is a hotel in the centre of the city on a busy street. We also heard siren noise, but not general traffic noise. Noise level is as I would expect. There was a good happy hour in the downstairs bar and a nice patio area which appeared to be frequented by both locals and guests.

Our tub was also clogged (yuck!) the plug in the tub was stuck, called the lobby and they sent someone up to fix it right away. What maintenance basically did was popped it open with a flat head screw driver and just lefted it as is....um what if the next guest wanted to take a bath??

We ate in the hotel's restaurant one night, good food and service but nothing remarkable for the price. The ambience wasn't great somehow. The adjacent bar area was much more popular, we should have eaten there instead. The room (a Grand Deluxe) was perfectly nice. Heavenly Beds are always great. The replenishment of amenities each day varied though (as another poster commented recently). We had mouthwash on the first day only. Body wash not always replenished. Bottled water also only on the first day, not replenished after that. Heavenly towels some days, but not others. The cleaning standards were just fine. I'm sure if it had been an issue they would have dealt with it. We had to swap rooms as the first one had a fault with the air system that kept waking us up. The desk staff dealt with this quickly and the replacement room we moved to was fine. There were errors on our account on checkout because of this room change; these too were quickly rectified. The hotel does seem to be keen to resolve any issues before they become problems. Like other travellers, I feel that being charged extra for internet access these days is a dinosaur from the past. That said, it worked just fine and was a reasonable speed. We used the business centre, which was fine too. Just a little thing, we noticed that they pipe their signature scent (same as the bathroom toiletries) through the lobby. It did seem a bit overpowering at times, something to note if you are sensitive to such things.

I booked 5 nights here in the beginning of October for a stay during Christmas time. Through the Westin website I found a great rate that required prepayment along with no cancellation or modification. Just fyi, the rate on the Westin site was better than Orbitz, Travelocity, Hotels.com, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so it's worth the time and effort to double check the hotel's website before booking. Well the day before we are to leave for San Francisco, my partner injures his back throwing some kids around on the bed. At first it seemed as if it was just a strained muscle but as the night wore one it was clear he was not going to be able to travel, he could barely get out of bed to walk around! I cancelled all of our reservations (air, car, restaurant) but when I got ready to call the Westin I recalled my reservation was not able to be cancelled or changed. But I thought perhaps I could just move the reservation a few nights\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 possibly if my partner's back felt better we would still make it for part of the trip and extend out a few more days\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 maybe someone would be in a kind mood as it was the holiday season. I ended up speaking with three different people before I talked to Justin the front desk manager. First, the 800 number customer service agent\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 she tried to adjust the reservation but was unable. Very nice and advised I call the hotel directly. I then spoke with someone from the hotel's reservations desk and she also attempted to change my booking with no luck. She suggested talking to the front desk directly. When I reached the front desk they passed me over to the manager. He couldn't have been more pleasant. I told him I was aware that my reservation was pretty much carved in stone, but that perhaps they could just modify it somewhat so I wouldn't be stuck with a large bill for a hotel stay that never took place. Justin went beyond that and offered me a full refund. Not once did he nor anyone I spoke with from Westin ever say my reservation absolutely could not be changed. No one had a \"too bad\" attitude, in fact just the opposite, everyone made a sincere effort to help even though it was quite clear from my reservation that I wasn't allowed to cancel or change it. To be honest I was not expecting this at all. I'm not sure they would have been so helpful had I booked through a third party site, as I've heard many stories citing that hotel staff is unable or unwilling to make certain changes when reservations are booked through alternative sites so I'm glad I booked through Westin.com.

California Pizza Kitchen is directly opposite, Chevys is 2 blocks down, a liquer store next door & CVS round the corner. Two down sides - 1. Car parking is extremely expensive. For the full-size SUV we had wouldve cost us $45 a night. I knew this prior to travelling to SF so dis a bit of homework on parking lots on the area.

The hotel generally was OK, the rooms were nice typical Westin rooms and the location was very good. The entrance area and lobby was pretty dull, it seems as if they spent more space and time designing the bar area (which is hidden from the lobby by an imposing wall) which left the entrance area unfortunately barren and cramped. The staff for the most part were more cordial than congenial compared to most places that we have stayed, although there were some nice exceptions through the stay with morning greetings and a doorman opening the door, but these were well received anomalies for our stay. Also, we only approached the concierge once, early in the trip, and was so put off by the interaction that we chose not to visit again. We were the only ones there, there were two attendants available, and our questions were pretty basic, primarily regarding the Muni system. That was very disappointing. All the above were minor detractions for us, and when Geraldine at the front desk provided assistance by obtaining a different room for our last night we were most appreciative. In fact, it was one of many highlights of our overall trip. You always hear about 'one bad apple' ruining things, but one good apple can help obscure those things mentioned above. Very nice. If you are planning on staying here, here are some specific tips: Try to get a room on the highest floor possible if you enjoy great views. We stayed on a lower one, then the higher one and the difference is amazing. Many Muni connections are less than a block away, including the retro F-line streetcars that cruise up and down Market Street, and take you directly to the Wharf. Bart is a couple of blocks, depending on where you exit the station. (The Montgomery station itself is a couple of blocks long!) Having a good game plan here will save lots of walking with luggage. The hotel isn't on Market itself, it's about an 1/2 block off, down 3rd street. We found the location to be excellent. There is a nearby Starbucks, and a little French Cafe just around the corner to get you going in the morning. Also, directly across the street is much more affordable parking. Be aware though, there are 2 garages across the street. One offers 24 hour parking for $20 while the other one claims to be $21. The $21 rate ends at 6am(regardless of when you enter) and begins again to charge at a rate of $5 per 20 mins. You may think you're getting a deal, but...... I forget the names, but the better one is the one with the large \"P\" sign that you actually park your own car, keep your keys and pay the attendant on the street level before you return to your car. Parking in SF is expensive, we only rented a car for our day trips to the coast and Napa and used Muni for everything else. It's very easy and convenient. One final tip....if you do rent a car, either rent a car with a navigation system or bring yours from home. You will greatly appreciate it as SF is pretty difficult to navigate on our own.

We arrived late and left our car - which is a big downside of the hotel, $54/night parking, which I have to say, is probably about right for hotel parking in the city, but still ridiculous. I forgot to turn in the public parking lot which is just around the corner and will probably charge you half as much. Although check in took a little while, the guy came back telling us he was upgrading us to a suite. We have a lot of Starwood points, and were using them this time, so often we get upgrades, but we were thrilled nonetheless, especially since we hadn't gotten a suite upgrade in the past. The room was actually a handicap accessible suite so there were certain differences, but nothing that bothered us. There wasn't a tub but that wasn't a problem for us. There was a large sitting area with double couches, TV, desk, etc, then a good size bathroom and a separate bedroom. The beds are always good - i think we'll buy the heavenly bed for our house when we finally move.

We made arrangements to stay at the Westin on Market & 3rd. From the valet staff to the housekeepers, all were courteous and friendly. However, there was one person who made all the difference throughout my stay, thanks to Justin Seeto, we had one of the best times in San Francisco. Upon arrival, our room wasn't ready so we decided to go for a late lunch. Justin asked for my phone number so he can contact us when our room was done. I was very, very impressed with the follow through! Having worked in hospitality, I'm always skeptical with the level of service. However, Justin made me feel at ease. Our room was a corner room at the 34th floor. The view was breath taking...it's stunning. We didn't want to leave just because we loved the view so much. The room was very clean, the bed was very comfortable, and the amenities were vey nice. We had to leave for the theater, but I was excited to return to the hotel that evening. When we returned to the room, there was a chilled bottle of champagne waiting for us. It was such a beautiful surprise! Needless to say, champagne and the view made for an amazing end to the evening. Overall, I would not only recommend this hotel to travelers (it's close to public transportation and shopping), but I would definitely go back.

Location, service, and room were all wonderful. We arrived late on Thursday and were immediately upgraded to a room on the 32nd floor - checkin was effortless and took just minutes.

I called the hotel directly and was quoted a rate of $199. When I asked if they would match the Expedia rate, I was quoted an \"internet rate\" of $142. The reservation rep told me I could make our reservation at the $199 rate, and as long as I prepaid it 48 hours before arrival, I would still get the $142 rate. When I called the hotel two weeks before arrival, I was given every excuse for them not to honor what the clerk had quoted me. They told me they would \"check the tape\" on the conversation, which took three days. When they did call me back, I received nothing but a huge run around and a bunch of lies about what the conversation was between myself and the reservation clerk. I asked them to play the conversation so we could both hear it -- and was told very conveniently that was not possible. Very disappointing, because it was too late to find another hotel at a good rate. What was most irritating was they lied. I wish they had just told me outright they would not honor what the clerk told me. Regardless, once I got past that, we had a good stay.

Our bag never made it to the room, we waited and finaly after about an hour I called the \"service express line\" and asked when my luggage would be brought up and was transfered to the bell desk with out anything said (rude), the bell desk then asks me what my bags look like!?! They advertise 24 hour room service on their web site but it is not 24 hour room service. Breakfast 6 to 10:30 am, NO lunch service, and Dinner from 4:00 PM to 10:30 PM. I called at 10:00 PM to order desert and was told they had only ice cream for desert, even though their menu had 6 desert items listed. Thje mini bar in the room is automated so if you touch a softdrink or candy bar you are billed immediatly. Problem is they don't make that clear. I had to ask Housekeeping to come to our room to verify we had not taken anything from the mini bar after we got the bill the night before check out that had billed us 100.00 worth of mini bar items we did not consume but moved so we could put soft drinks we bought at 7-11 into the ice box. The service express was not helpful in getting this straighten out. On check out day when we returned to our room, before check out time our key was turned off and would not unlock the door. We had to wait 20 min. security to come and let us in after checking our ID's. Valet Parking was 54.00 per day.

Cleanliness: During our stay the room was cleaned daily and we were provided fresh linens and replacement soaps in a consistent and timely manner. The hallways and lobby also appeared well kept. The windows overlooking the promenade could use a good Windex by housekeeping. Location: I was in-town for a conference and this was one of the recommended hotels. The hotel is located in the financial district. During the week the streets were very busy and the hotel was within convenient walking distance to buses and other ground transportation. We also stayed through the weekend and the area became very quiet. The hotel is in a good location if you have business in the area but the hotel would not be my first choice if I was visiting San Fran on holiday. There are a lot of comparable hotels in closer vicinity to the attractions. Rooms: We stayed in a Gold Starwood Preferred Guest suite. The room was what we expected for a Westin Hotel room. Service: Front desk was very friendly and professional. Management could revisit the concierge desk. The gentleman that assisted us with our weekend excursions was not friendly, at all, and gave us the impression we were bothering him. Either he was clearly in the wrong job or he was having a bad day. Value: I used Starwood Points for the week which I believe was 10,000 points a night. The weekend rate was $129.00 which was a terrific rate against comparable hotels. The discounted weekend rate is likely because of its location in the financial district which becomes very quiet on the weekends. Sleep Quality: Bed was very comfortable and thermostat worked fine. Overall: I would \"consider\" staying at this Westin San Francisco Market Street again but I am not completely sold. I think I read somebody's review, prior to staying there, to put an additional set of eyes on the bill before checking out. I was also warned by the front desk person to double check the statement and sure enough there were multiple charges made to my room from the restaurant, parking garage and Internet service. It was a bit ridiculous. The front desk person removed the charges but I was still charged for parking later on. I did not even rent a car.

I travel to SF 1 - 2 x's a year, staying 5-7 days for business. This will be by 3rd year in row to stay at this Westin--but I will not be returning after this. Normally I book through the hotel direct, but recently my company set a mandate to use Expedia Corporate for bookings. At check-in I was told I would be on the 6th floor. The hotel has 35 floors so I requested a high floor for views--where I normally stay. It was explained that since I booked with Expedia, that I would have to have a lower floor. Being a Starwood preferred guests; I mentioned I should have a complimentary upgrade. The a lady at check in said the best she could do would be a handicap room on a higher floor but it has a queen bed instead of my King reservation. I reluctantly took the handicap room. Upon entry I was disappointed in the hospital/urine smell, no bath tub, and very limited counter space (not even enough for my toiletry bag). However at this point, I was so tired and the desk worker was not in a helpful mood, I decided to move my room tomorrow. The next morning I noticed the room did not have an ironing board. I requested one and it took almost 30 minutes to have it delivered, making me nearly late for my meeting. After lunch my client decided to stop by the hotel lobby for an informal work session. The wi-fi fee is $15 a day--since I had already signed up, I asked the front desk for the promo code for free wi-fi for my client. I was told non-guests were not allowed use of the wi-fi. So I said, \"Okay let's try this again...let's say my husband needs Wi-Fi and I have already purchased it, how do we get him a code?\" The desk worker said \"your husband' would have to buy another wi-fi access. She further explained the fee is per person, not per room. \"So let me get this straight, in addition to the $500 for the room, the $100 for parking, and the $75 I have already paid for Wi-Fi, you want me to give you even more?\" I thanked the lady for not being helpful and walked away. I was baffled by the lack of customer service that I was not use to at a Westin. After 8 hrs of meetings, I came back very tired thinking a nice bath would be nice--but oh yeah--my room doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have one. So I requested a room change again. Again, I was told I would have to move to the lowest floor since I booked \"with Expedia\". It was like I had been blacklisted--every time they looked my up and saw I booked through Expedia, suddenly I became someone they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to help.

In my case that was going from a room on 15 or higher to something like 25 or higher on the Mission St. side of the building instead of one of the city views. The garden view is Yerba Buena which is 1/2 a block of grass. My first room was on 27, a connecting room with a loud ventilation fan in the bathroom that didn't turn off with the lights. I asked to be switched and was again given the best room spiel and given the same type of room on 33. It seems that the bathroom ventilation fans never turn off so you'll have to remember to shut the door if you are sensitive to it as I am. This was a different but still connecting room which I try to avoid. Funny how I had two connecting rooms in a row while a previous poster couldn't get one even after requesting in advance! Everything else was nominal. Location is great whether for a tourist or conventioneer. Bathroom is small, you can't sit without your leg against the tub if you know what I mean. Housekeeping was fine, everything worked as indicated.

After some dificulties with the manager to understand we had special needs (he wanted to give us rooms in different floors at that first night), the recepcionist gave us an upgrade to the highest floor (wonderfull view) for both rooms and we could get a room in front of the other. The bellman was very friendly (Jamal), and so all the others at the bellman desk. Unfortunately, I can\u00c2\u00b4t say the same for the concierge desk, all them are very arrogant. They make you feel unconfortable to ask informations, usually they directed us to the computer at the buseness center to get what we need - information about hertz openning hour at the SFO, f.e. Hotel lobby area is very croweded, with lots of business people and those attending meets there, at the conference center. The worst part of it is the restaurant Ducca. We ate there twice at dinner and once for breakfast. The oriental guy supposed to put water on our glasses, many times fulled the glass more than possible, sreading water at the table. The same with the olive oil, he spread oil at the table too, not because he fulled it but because his movements were too terrible. One day we got breakfast there. When we\u00c2\u00b4ve just seated, the waitress asked our order, so we said we would like to see the menu for options, and she looked at her watch for a long time and said breakfast time was about to finish. My husband asked her what was breakfast hours (we had already confirmed it at the reception desk before entering the restaurant), and told her we still had twenty minutes and it would not take longer. After she brought the juices, coffee and bread basket we ordered, she asked if we would charge to the room, and gave us the check. It can\u00c2\u00b4t happen in a hotel like this. Staff must be more polite, she could have said the same (that we didn\u00c2\u00b4t have long time for breakfast ) in an elegant way. Now, the grand finale: The day after, we were having dinner at the restaurant and I saw a mouse!!! It appeared, took something at the floor and desappeared. I was so astonish... I told the waiter very quietly and he was not surprised, he said he would ask someone to take care of it.

From the 22nd floor (which is not the highest, 36 is), you can still get some stunning views of San Francisco from one huge floor-to-ceiling window.

Was happy to see there is a safe in the room, I can leave my laptop there. And the bathroom had plenty of towels. It's a nice hotel. I wonder if some employees at this hotel were ever affected by the recession. When I asked what was the cheapest way to get from the hotel to the airport, the concierge told me after discount, I can take the town car for $45. After the financial crisis and recession, the economy may be improving but that does not mean people have money to throw away. If I can take Bart to SFO for $8 and arrive exactly where I want, without any more walking, why would I be interested in paying $45?

We arrived at SFO from LA around 8am and used the BART to get into the city centre. It took around 30 minutes and you can either get off at the Powell or Montgomery Street stations. The Westin is about half way between both stations and is about a 5 minute walk. I would recommend the BART as an alternative to a shuttle or taxi. Not only is it fun and adds to the adventure but its also easy to use and follow and is totally safe. Because it was early morning when we arrived at the hotel we were originally hoping to have our bags placed in storage until we could check in. To our surprise the very friendly staff member allowed us to check in early as well as provide us with a 2pm check out time. We were on the 24th floor which provided us with superb views of the city and alcatraz. The room itself was great and very spacious. One thing I would advise is be careful of the mini bar fridge. Don't bump or remove any of the items because there is no time delay on the products and you end up getting charged. Once again the friendly staff member at the front counter was only too obliging to remove the charge from our account. There is a gym on the 4th floor which is complementary. It is well equipped with weight machines and cardio equipment. We didn't eat at the Restaurant or use room service. The Westin is right in the heart of the city centre and is only a 5-10 minute walk to the trams and shopping centre. The F line tram which takes you to Fishermans Wharf is less than a 2 minute walk. We have nothing but good things to say about the Westin and its staff, accomodation and location. We highly recommend it to others. The only negative I have which does not involve the Westin or SF is United Airlines. We flew with UAL from LA to SF. All I can say is this airline sux.

The conference facilities were great, but as for our room, on the whole I'd have to say it was just vanilla...The beds were comfortable but not over the top, the bathroom was CRAZY small. We called to ask for a fridge for our room to keep some wine chilled and it took a few calls before we got it. Would have been easier if we could have just temporarily moved the stuff in the minibar fridge out but they have one of those sensors that charges you when something gets moved, so we didn't try it. Our room was on the 23rd floor, which provided some interest for my young kids....watching fire trucks approach the area from 10 blocks away, watching the fog roll across the city, etc. As for location, it is tough to beat. My husband and kids joined me for the trip even though I was attending conferences for most of the time, and they had the cable car terminus, union square, and the Yerba Buena park all within a 5 min walk. A BART station is also right nearby. We also took the F cable car down to the market at Embarcadero. The food stands there are amazing -- just too bad it isn't open for longer hours. For anyone going to a convention at the Moscone center, it is 1 block away. We ate twice at restaurants that were within walking distance of the hotel and had been recommended by the concierge. I thought both were uninspiring. We had thought about eating at the restaurant downstairs but the menu was rather pricey and their prix fixe menu (one night a week) only had 2 choices for entrees, both red meat which I don't eat. Best meal the whole trip was our burrito run into the Mission!! Two separate notes...our conference \"rate\" offered by the organizer was about $150/night higher than the rate I booked the room for online. At the rate I got, I think it's an OK value, but no one should pay >$200 for a room here. It's just not that nice and I'm sure you could find better easily. On a final up note, we had a late flight home and the front desk was very accommodating about holding our bags until our departure to the airport at 6pm. We had asked that they have a cab waiting to take us to the airport when we returned from sightseeing shortly before 6. Instead of a cab, they had the hotel \"driver\" take us for the same cost as a cab.

Both were promptly refreshed upon request. 2. we experience a bit of problem getting our keys to work, a problem that the desk clerk told us on checkout was probably related to a low battery in the lock mechanism.

We stay at Westins often, so it would have been interesting to have ended up someplace else.) The room was on a corner and had amazing views.

Yes, we booked with Priceline, found out that it was actually cheaper to book directly with the hotel (California residents get an extra 10% off) and when we called Priceline about the price discrepancy...we actually got a refund for the difference.

Also public transport is nearby if you need to get around...we took Bart from SFO and it was a breeze. Although I wouldn't recommend from OAK, we did that once and it was painful.

Not even sure the bed was king size. The bathroom door cleared the toilet by about a quarter inch, and for the \"floor-to-ceiling\" windows, they don't tell you that the ceiling above the bed is only about maybe 7 feet high to start with, then there's some sort of built in overhang that lowers the ceiling over the window to about 6 feet. On the plus side: The bed was super comfortable, very soft sheets, and the in-room coffee and tea were awesome. Plus, we requested a fridge, bathrobes, and slippers for no extra charge. Awesome TV. Also, the front desk was really nice and gave us a 2pm checkout b/c we overslept. Minuses: A prom and some other sort of young event downstairs, so lots of teens in the lobby, a few standing around drinking out of red plastic cups. Second, the \"sweeping view\" in our deluxe room on the 9th floor was the office building across the street. Then there's the small size of the rooms (ours was maybe 8' x 10' + small closet and bathroom) and also the fact that although there was an advertised $109 rate, I had to call the 800 number to get it b/c it wasn't available online.

I compared it with MANY hotels and decided it was the best deal in a very safe location. It couldn't compare with the Westin St. Francis which promises to make your children feel welcome (wecome pkg, etc.). There is not a speck of personal service or attention here. I have always thought of the Westin as a nice hotel and this trip changed my mind. It falls under the Marriott. I will admit that I stayed in a Hampton Inn overnight on a road trip, once, and the room & service was as nice or nicer than this. Our children are the quietest, most well-behaved children (per others) and they said they didn't feel welcome there and actually complained when we pulled into the Westin SF Airport on our last night. Luckily, we spent most of our time out of our room, because it was nothing special and not as nice as our home. The floors were also pretty dirty. The \"large\" windows were not as large as most hotels where I've stayed and the view was bad...and I am a Starwood member; which obviously means nothing. We also had 2 charges that were not ours but they took them off without question and very nicely...they were so obviously not our charges. Room service breakfast was also speedy and friendly. You also have to ask for toiletries. Typically, one would find a shower cap and body soap, but the rooms are only stocked with shampoo and hand soap - nothing more. The recession has hit the hotels! Our room did NOT have the heavenly beds either. They were not great actually; we know heavenly beds, and did have them following our stay when we went to the airport Westin, and the difference is discernable. I can't imagine we just got a bad room. Do not take restaurant recommendations from the concierge; do your own homework! We had a restaurant picked out and the concierge told us she knew of a better one. We should have been clued in when she gave us a post it to give the owner with his name and her full name on it. It wasn't very good and was filled with tourists. Not a single ethnic person in a Chinatown restaurant!?! It was not good and she was obviously getting a kickback from them. (I believe in the form of chinese takeout!) We were unhappy. All in all, if you can get a cheap room and do not want anyone to talk to you from the hotel, stay here.

All but this one were fantastic. This one was a disappointment. We arrived from New York on Dec 29 after a delayed flight and were so tired that we did not check the room(869). As I tried to get to sleep I kept hearing a noise that I put down to the cable cars outside on Powell Street. At 2am I realised that the noise was not the cable car but the elevator and our room was directly behind the elevator shaft!! On thinking back to the checkin I remembered the woman behind the desk grimacing when she saw what room she was giving us and a slight look of panic as she handed us the room keys. At 6am, after getting no sleep I rang down to the front lobby to get a change of room as we were staying 4 nights and the room was too noisy. The clerk on the front desk asked what room I was in. I told him and he said he understood perfectly. He told me we could go to 874 and I should come down to reception to get the keys. After packing our bags and moving them to outside 874 (at the other end of the hotel) I went down to the lobby to drop off the old keys and pick up the new ones. I asked the clerk if 874 was next to an ice machine, stairs, elevator etc and he said \"I wouldn't do that to you, brother. I'll just make sure\". He opened a drawer and consulted a sheet of paper which I guess contained all the Priceline rooms. It took him 15 minutes of consulting the computer and the sheet of paper before giving me the keys to room 867 (two rooms from the first room, 869). So I went back up to the 8th floor, told my partner that we had to move the bags back to the other end of the hotel. I wondered what was wrong with 874. So, after carrying our bags all the way back to the other end of the hotel, I opened the door to 867 to find the new room was a lot smaller than the first one and we had been downgraded from a king-size bed to a queen. I rang the front desk again and was told that I was given a standard room with a queen bed and the only standard rooms with a king size bed were next to the elevator shaft. I am 6'6\" tall and am used to sleeping in a king sized bed but having had no sleep that night I resigned ourselves to this room. The room did not appear that clean- it looked like it had not been vacuumed in quite a while (there was visible dust and the bath looked like it had not been cleaned with a creme cleanser in a while). Little did I know this was just the start of our hygiene problems. On New Years Eve, the 8th floor rooms started filling up with what appeared to be frat aged guests. The hotel was hosting a New Years party and the atmosphere became quite lively which I enjoyed. In the early morning we stepped out of our room to go on a tour to find a pool of vomit just outside our neighbor's door. A few more yards along another pool of vomit and then another one just outside the elevator. I thought I should mention this to the front desk as it would be hours before the housemaids would be coming around. With the smell still in my nostrils I mentioned this to the woman behind the front desk. She did not look surprised and asked if we would like another room. I said no as I had already been moved and I was just mentioning this as it should be cleaned up as soon as possible. I told her where the vomit was. She consulted her computer. After a few seconds she said \"Priceline\" to herself out loud without looking at me and opened a drawer. She removed a couple of complementary coffee coupons from the drawer and asked if could she offer me them in apology. I said no thank you but felt quite insulted by her manner. First of all, a coffee costs 20c to produce and secondly, she categorized me by the fact I was a Priceline customer. When we returned to the room that evening the \"solid\" bits of the vomit had been cleaned up but the smell and stains were still there. I rang the \"Express Service\" number and mentioned it to them. Two hours later, after no action, I asked one of the housemaids cleaning a room next door (late checkout) to address it. The stain outside my room was shampoo'ed but not the others. Is \"Express Service\" an oxymoron at Westin?? In our travels around the U.S we used a mix of Priceline, Hotwire and hotel chain websites to get good value rates. In comparison to to other hotel chains where I received excellent service and value for money I don't think I can recommend Westin either for this hotel or their approach to service. On the plus side, the hotel is the oldest hotel in San Francisco and oozes history. Have a look in the ballrooms get get a feel of the old San Francisco. The location is perfect in Union Square. You can walk from the Market Street BART station (3 blocks slightly uphill) straight from the airport. Only $4.35 each. P.S I lodged the above comments via their website and got a response email offering me 5.000 (sic) points Starwood Guest Points. In the response they called me by another surname 3 times and my surname is the 15th most common surname in the English language.

Hell, I had an actual work desk, a 32-inch (or maybe it was larger) LCD TV, two very comfy lounging chairs, a full mini-bar, a full closet, and, a king size heavenly bed. The room even had a small ante-room leading to the main bedroom! (The fact that I paid considerably less per night for the Westin compared to the Hotel Mela sweetened the deal considerably.) I should also mention that the room was very clean. I quite liked the lobby and the hallways. Further, the location was very convenient to the SF MOMA, the Moscone Convention Center, Yerba Buena Gardens, and shopping (Westfield San Francisco Center. Virgin Mega Store, Apple Store, ROSS, and Old Navy, to name a few.) Some stuff to note, however: (a) the bathroom was plain jane. Nothing distinguishing about it at all. (b) some of the extras I was hoping for were AWOL. No complimentary bottled water. No slippers. No shower gel. No toothbrush kit. No sewing kit. No shower cap. None of that mattered (well, except maybe for the complimentary bottled water) to me though since I had the necessary toiletries with me. (c) I got charged for mini-bar consumption despite my not having actually consumed anything from the mini-bar. Apparently, as explained to me by the front desk, the fridge has an electronic sensor such that, the minute you move anything in the fridge, you're automatically charged for consumption. As such, when I moved stuff around to accomodate perishables I'd bought, I got charged. (I'm not sure I actually believe the front desk's explanation by the way. The electronic fridge system, if it actually exists, just seems like a great way for the hotel to get into unncessary arguments with guests.) In any case, the hotel reversed the charges without giving me a tough time about it. So, I'm not complaining. (d) I came back one day to find a cleaning rag left behind by housekeeping on top of a cabinet. No biggie for me, I just placed the rag along with my used towels, but I can envision how such an episode could irritate other less sanguine guests. (e) The lifts had a key card security system to control access to the guest floor. However, the system was apparently not yet up and running during my stay. Lastly, I should mention that I was able to book my room for about USD180 (including tax) a night directly through the SPG website.

I am fairly local (just over an hour away) and I have to say that this hotel is an outstanding value for anyplace in the Bay Area, let alone San Francisco, and let alone Union Square! You can not go wrong. I booked the hotel directly with the hotel website. If you compare all the sites and prices, you will find that the hotel's own prices are the most reasonable, so I recommend booking directly. I was a little worried when I read some of these traveler reviews, but it is as if the negative posts stayed someplace else. Every detail was beyond satisfactory. I'll start at the beginning. We parked across the street at the Hearst Parking Garage. 24 hour parking cost only $20--um excuse me, actually this is cheap!! It is safe and secure and literally across the street. Just map everything before you go and you will find it alright. When we checked in, the clerk read my special comments and without asking, she upgraded us from a Grand Deluxe King room to a Premier King at no extra charge. We were on the 29th floor. The floor to ceiling windows make for a breathtaking view of Yerba Buena Gardens, the Metreon, Zeum carousel, the bay (even AT & T park if you know what to look for) and the hills of San Francisco. Imagine that at night time, with the lights. Just fantastic. I highly recommend asking for a room that faces Yerba Buena Gardens. Some of the complaints here were that the view of 3rd Street did not impress and I would agree, that if we had a room facing 3rd, it would NOT be the same experience. But remember, you get what you pay for. The Grand Deluxe rooms clearly state, \"High Floor.\" The bed looks exactly like the online photos and is extremely clean. That is precisely what I look for in a hotel, is cleanliness. The bathrooms are large, spacious, fully stocked with a hair dryer, bath robe in the closet, etc. The large screen tv, well stocked mini bar all says chic, elegant, modern. That is what you will get from the minute you walk into this hotel: modern elegance. From the huge white orchids in the lobby to the hotel lounge with the urban vibe, it delivers upscale taste at an extremely reasonable price. I can tell you that the price for a standard room here compares to that of a far inferior room in the wharf area (such as a Best Western.) As to other hotels in the Market Street area, you are looking at THE best priced hotel for the value in the area. This place can't be beat! Quality and affordability. You are getting upscale, quality service for a bargain rate. The concierge was helpful. Cabs come straight up to the door and took us to the Curran theatre, which was a $5 cab ride away. Everything is in walking distance. If you leave the hotel, go left to Market and left again and walk to Union Square. Go right out of the hotel and you are steps away from the SF Museum of Modern Art, the Metreon, St Patrick's Cathedral, Jewish Museum of Art, Yerba Buena Gardens (beauiful), Zeum, and the Children's Carousel. This location puts the value of the hotel far beyond the price they are charging. From the time we walked up to the front desk clerk, who upgraded our room in celebration of my husband's birthday, and offered him a glass of wine to boot, to the convenient parking across the street to the LOCATION beyond belief, to the cleanliness of the room and the comfort of the beds: I highly recommend this hotel! Note: if you are looking for a \"historic\" looking hotel, then you want to stay at the Westin St Francis or the Sir Francis Drake. That is an entirely different type of experience.

Overall, we thought we 'shop' around in terms of hotels: we stayed at the Mandarin Oriental (by far the best hotel with impeccable service and amazing views from the rooms), the Fairmont (grande dame of hotels in San Fran, but really no longer up to scratch with its facilities) and the Westin. First of all, I rang the hotel to confirm that we would get a king size room on the upper floors as set out in our booking. However, upon our arrival (which was at 20.45pm - the hotel was aware of that) we were told that this was impossible and also never confirmed. When I saw the room we got (next to the lifts), I went back down to the lobby and requested a change (which we eventually got after much debate). By 21.30, we unpacked and went to the receptionist (who had been exceptionally rude upon check-in) and asked whether there would be any good restaurants in the area that would still be open (it was a Tuesday night after all). The answer: he did not know (he was the receptionist and concierge at the time!), but there would be a 7/11. Tired of arguing with hotel staff that clearly did not like their job, we went out and around the corner to the Four Seasons where I explained the situation (sorry, should have stayed at your hotel, we are stuck with the Westin now and an incompetent concierge) and their (friendly) concierge pointed out three closeby restaurants which were open and the one we chose was a real hit! I am not going into any further detail of what else happened when we stayed at the Westin (wrong final bill - when I pointed it out, they acted as if it was MY fault that the bill was wrong and they generally could not care less), but it was one of the most irritating hotel stays I have ever had (and I travel around the world a lot as part of my job). As a general rule (by now): when hotels start giving their mattresses or showers special names (heavenly bed or heavenly shower), just stay away from it.

Our breakast server was very good and attentive to our needs. We arrived back late one night right about closing time for the restaurant and we wanted to order dessert. They allowed us to which was very nice and the desserts themsleves were just OK. I really only had 2 issues with the hotel, we stayed in room 405 and for the entire stay we never had a trash can in the bathroom, only under the desk which is unusual. Also, every night we stayed the room attendant short sheeted the bed by 2 inches.

Hope this is of help to someone! We thought our (10 day) stay at the Westin Market street location was fair for the price. We found a special on Expedia, and the value was good- I believe that it worked out to be around 150$ Canadian, per night, taxes included. I think we likely had the least expensive type of room. The highlights were an EXTREMELY comfortable bed, a great location, and the outdoor terrace located beside the restaurant. The terrace provided a small, quiet haven in the middle of a bustling city and you could order drinks, food, or even bring your own items and enjoy the atmosphere. There is a gym in the hotel and it has enough equipment to provide you with a fair workout while away. We ate at the hotel's restaurant \"Ducca\" one night and also quite enjoyed that. To elaborate more on the location, we found it very convenient. It's right downtown, with endless great restaurants and the major shopping section just around the corner. Chinatown is also a very short walk away. A short cab ride will take you to the wharf, telegraph hill, Mission Delores, etc.. We are big walkers so we walked to these sites- but they are around a 45 minute walk and more in some cases so not for the weary! Cable cars (as well as other modes of transport) are all around and probably a more fun way of travelling to your chosen site. The only drawback of being in such a central location would be the noise level. Market and 3rd streets are busy - the traffic & the frequent sound of sirens were well heard within our 7th floor room- which faced the street. Maybe a room which doesn't directly face the street might help somewhat. We got used to the noise, and the really comfortable beds do help to encourage restful sleep for the most part. Also- the rooms are not huge but we found them fair enough for our purposes. Lastly, for those looking to vacation in San Fran like we did - I want to mention that we really enjoyed the Alcatraz tour (great audio guide available), a wine tour through Tower Tours (67$ pp 3 wineries & tastings incl), renting a car through Budget car rental (5 minutes walk away on Howard) and driving down the scenic HWY 1 (not to be missed if you have the time), as well as dinner at the Cliff House restaurant overlooking the Pacific.

You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got buses, streetcars and trams within a few minutes walk that service the majority of the City, and public transport is pretty decent (and relatively cheap) in San Fran so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no reason not to use it.

Amenities / Rooms: We had a standard Queen-bed room on the lower floors, but asking politely at the front desk got us moved up to a higher floor, corner room with nice City views \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a good start! Room was well equipped, good TV with plenty of channels, nice bathroom and a very comfy bed. Soap / Shampoo etc all good quality and a free daily USA Today.

As I said the only problem was getting proper mugs instead of paper cups \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which did take a few calls to different people before they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d help us! Lastly the Concierge was very pleasant and helpful with the couple of queries we had. General San Fran: Hit the major tourist spots (Alcatraz, Haight Ashbury, Fishermans Wharf, Chinatown etc) as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all worth seeing, but book Alcatraz in advance as it sells out often! Nob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hill is great for some views down the very steep streets.

The chowder was really really good. Plus it's about a 15minute walk to Ghirardelli Square and an awesome chocolate sundae. All in all, I loved this hotel and city.

Second: After a unhelpful and slow service provided by the Conciege, I finally got my room key, my baggages still unattended, I decide to unload my baggages from the trolley and carry to my room myself.

It seemed a tad less touristy than the one in Union Square although I was a little skeptical since Westin had just bought the old Argent hotel and they were still fixing it up a little. The hotel's location on Market Street is great. Just a few blocks south of Union Square and within easy walking distance. The BART is two blocks away and there are tons of bus stops on Market so transportation is easy to come by. Walgreens is across the street from the hotel on Market and there's a Starbucks AND a Peet's on Third (the hotel is at the corner of Market and Third) so you can take your pick in the morning! (You can make complimentary tea or Starbucks coffee in your room via your coffee machine - they even provide the to-go paper cups and lids - but for fancier drinks you can visit the coffee house.) The SFMOMA and Moscone Center is also 2 blocks away on Third. The room itself was nice and offered the typical Westin amenities - heavenly bed, bath, etc. It wasn't huge, but not too cramped, either. There was a nice wide flat-screen tv, working desk, and mini bar. They've redecorated, but I could still see bits of the former hotel lingering (the sign on the fridge still says, \"Argent\"). I had one small issue with the hotel, but it was cleared up with no problems. Westin provides a few snack bar items in a metal basket that they place on top of the dresser. I moved them to make room for my stuff. Unfortunately, each item had a weight sensor so of course I was charged for everything in the basket. I explained and Ken at the front desk was super nice and had all charges removed ASAP.

I was hoping this Westin would fare better than the one in Los Angeles, and thankfully it did! Personally I did not have any complaints! The rooms were spacious with great views. Flat screen t.v.'s were in every room as promised, unlike the L.A. Westin. The hotel staff was very nice and accomodating. When we removed items from the mini bar to store our food in we simply called down when we were checking out and told them to please remove the items from the bill that we had put everything back, and it was done, no questions asked! I think the only small complaint might be that my friends parents rooms smelled like smoke even when the requested a no smoking room. But other than that things were great! The concierege was extremely helpful as well arranging a car service for my friend and printing her boarding pass for her! We also tried the restaurat, Decca??, I think. The food was amazing! A bit overpriced but very good. They have fancy names for everything but if you ask the waiter they will put it in lamens terms for you. I had the burger which was delish! Especially the special fries that come with it! There were a couple of complaints that the service was a bit slow but I personally didn't experience any of that. When I blistered my feet from walking around all day I left a message for the concierege asking for band-aids and within 20 min. there was a knock on my door with a man holding band-aids for me on the other side. The same thing happened when my friend forgot her toothbrush! They brought up a toothbrush and toothpaste within minutes! And even if they didn't have a certain item they didn't tell you where you could get it, they went out and got it for you! My friend's mom asked for something they didn't carry (I can't remember what exactly it was) but they said they would run down to the local Walgreens and pick it up for her and asked if there was anything else she needed...(she asked them to get her a green tea since they were over there).

Easy access to BART from SFO- and 10 minute slow stroll (not up steep incline) to the hotel from Montgomery BART station. (Best to have exact fare for the BART ticket machines-limited change given) The rooms with two queen beds were spacious. The room with one king bed was tiny and cramped. Book a two-bed room-its the same price. Obviously, there are noisy, windy rooms but our rooms were very clean and quiet, despite the wind. Rooms were located away from the elevators, midway down the hall, not in an alcove. No view except for the rooms on the 7th floor. The hotel is not pet-free. Members of our group have allergies and we were lucky that no one reacted to any dander that may have been left behind. We asked for non-feather bedding. Did not eat in hotel. Used gym daily-great facility. Front desk personnel varied greatly in friendliness and helpfulness. Used public transport daily. Best bargain was the $10 (monthly) seniors' pass-bought at Walgreens on Market Street (about 1 block from hotel) and 3-day adult pass-bought at visitor's center on Powell St. (or any station). Lots of bus stops on Third street or Market street (1/2 block away). Catch the F-line antique street cars on Market St. to Ferry Bldg/Fisherman's wharf or stroll 10 minutes to the Powell street cable car. #71 bus (stops on Market Street) goes directly to Haight-Ashbury and Golden Gate Park. Food: Teens liked the BBQ chicken pizza at California Pizza across street from hotel. Try the upscale food court at Westfield Centre on Powell and Market. Mistral Rotisserie Provencale (check their website) at the Ferry Bldg serves well-seasoned lamb, duck , beef and pork dishes for under $12.00 for combo plate. We got there just before closing so seating for 8 was not a problem, and got huge portions. Chinatown tips-for a traditional experience, avoid restaurants that have a greeter. Look for a place with a lot of locals. After souvenir shopping on Grant Ave, go along Stockton Ave. Excellent egg custard tarts at Cafe Honolulu (between Post and Clay) and directly across the street, tiny You's Dim Sum serves OK dim sum-their $1 congee was OK too. Red Blossom tea house on Grant was fun (buy their tea). Scoma's on Pier 47-mediocre /expensive food but big portions. crab cakes were good (share your meal)-no seating problem at 5 pm. Had to have chocolate ice cream sundaes at Ghirardelli square. Lunch at Trattoria Pinocchio in North Beach-homemade pasta/sauces and desserts-20 minute walk from hotel along Kearney to Columbus(easy walk for the 82 year old).

We particularly wanted to be as high as possible (within our budget) and overlooking the city skyline. We arrived around 8pm and upon checking in asked to be put as high up as possible. The receptionist told us he had a room on the 32nd floor as someone hadnt turned up and it was now available. We were delighted, he tapped away on the computer and gave us our keys.... for a room on the 14th! I challenged this and asked about the room he had just mentioned on floor 32 and he said he couldnt give us that as it was allocated to another guest and assured us that he had given us one of the best rooms in the hotel. Too tired to argue, we accepted. The room on floor 14 overlooked the Yerba Buena gardens and a ground level building site which is immediately behind the hotel. Beds were fine, but the shower curtain was hanging off the rail and the water level in the toilet bowl was so high that you almost got wet when you sat on the loo! there was only one bathrobe supplied and the towels were a bit on the sparse side. We stayed there for the night and tried again at reception the following morning. We were told to leave our packed cases in the room and they would be moved to an alternative room by the time we came back from sightseeing in the afternoon. You guessed it, we came back around 4pm, asked at the desk and clearly nothing had been done. We were found a room on floor 26 but had to move our own luggage which I thought was a bit much given that the foyer is swarming with door staff, cocierges and bell boys! Overall the reception staff were a bit aloof... not the sort of service i was expecting really. The new room was identical to the other one, just higher up. The bathroom was in a better condition but still only one robe was supplied and again the number of towels seemed rather mean. We never got our city skyline views, bit the view from the back of the hotel over the Yerba Buena gardens, Moscone Centre and the bay in the distance was nice. We experienced the creaking of the hotel later in the week when the wind was really high (mentioned by another reviewer) but it wasnt an issue at all and not loud enough to disturb. We also experienced the fire alarm but were allowed to stay in our room until the hotel had checked it out and we were told it was a false alarm due to a problem in the garage. All of this was done over a PA system in the room.. very efficient and we were pleased not to have to walk down 26 flights. We didnt use the restaurent, way too expensive for anyone not on a business expense account! Breakfast items were individually priced and franky outrageous. There is a starbucks, a pizza restaurent, a Subway and a well stocked deli immediately outside the hotel so getting supplies to use in the room room isnt a problem. The mini bar is overpriced as is usually the case with hotels. The day before we left, i asked the guy who looked after the door how much time to allow for a cab to get to the airport during rush hour. He asked when we were leaving and said he would be on the door and would arrange for us to use the hotel limo as it was free. I took this to mean it was complimentary but when we arrived at the airport we were told the fare was 40 dollars! Thats more than a cab and I felt we had been misled somewhat. Beware if you are offered this service. It was nice to travel in style but you'll pay extra for it. So, positives: Great location Comfortable beds - and you can have a change of bedlinen every day if you want it. Fire alarm handled well.

I went ahead and booked a Deluxe King Corner Room thinking that sounded pretty nice and a definite upgrade on the standard Kings..boy was I wrong. Let me back up though. Indeed the Westin is very well positioned just off Market Street on 5th. It's a great spot not only to head out shopping for the day but also is a little less scary then a few blocks north up towards the Tenderloin (where a number of big chain hotels are.) The building itself is modern and the lobby is clean and functional. We were checked in and recognised as Gold Members and everything seemed to be fine.

I immediately went down to the front desk to only be told that I not only was in an upgraded room, but this room was an upgrade on the one I'd booked! After many discussions and the usual 'we're booked solid so can't move you' routine, we let it go. TIP: Be sure to triple check the room type you want/book..it is very easy to be fooled into thinking you're getting more then you are!

We were on the 9th floor, so we didn't hear too much noise anyway. Our room was spacious, nicely furnished, and the mattress was very comfortable. The bed linens were of good quality and there was a down comforter. The room had the usual amenities (coffee maker, iron and ironing board, hair dryer) and the towels were thick. My only complaint is that the bathroom (the room that contains the toilet and bathtub--the sink was in an alcove outside the bathroom) was extremely tiny. I literally had to move my body sideways to get the door open from the inside or there would have been no room to open the door without smashing it in my face.

I enjoyed my stay immensely and will try to use this as my hotel of choice in San Francisco. ADVANTAGES: 1) Great location one block off of Market Street at the Kearny/3rd St and Market intersection. Union Square is an easy walk going North across Market St., and Moscone Center/SFMOMA one block in the other direction. BART is two blocks away, making access to the Westin easy to from SFO. 2) Spacious rooms (mine was 3603--top floor with a view looking South) with all the appropriate accessories including HD screen and fantastically comfortable Heavenly Bed. 3) Very well equipped 24 hour fitness center with five treadmills, three ellipticals, three cycles, and various weight equipment. All have built-in video monitors and headphones are provided. Fitness center is complimentary, which is a distinct difference from the Westin St. Francis where there is a fairly steep daily charge. 4) Excellent service--my HD display wasn't working the day I arrived, and a call to \"service express\" brought an engineer within 5 minutes. He tightened a connection and ran through with me how to navigate the screen menu. Very helpful and friendly! 5) DUCCA Restaurant in the hotel is fabulous!

Cocktails that must be double-sized: My Bombay Sapphire martini was enormous! DISADVANTAGES: 1) Bathroom is rather small (but the glass-enclosed shower is cool!),. 2) Wireless internet access (somewhat slow) is $15/day. 3) Minibar and items in the open all mounted on a sensing platform that automatically charges your account if you so much as pick up an item.

There was only small concern, I rented a car as I took a day trip to Carmel. Parking is a nightmare in downtown SFO. The hotel charged $40.00 per night. The valet was kind enough to advise a city parking garage next door to the hotel that charged only $28 dollars per day. It was my own fault, since a car is not a necessity in San Francisco.

My mother and I stayed here for her birthday trip and (other than the aforementioned acknowledgement) were very pleased with this hotel. The location is great for those planning on visiting the Union Square area, shopping on Market Street, and reaching Fisherman's Wharf within a ten-fifteen minute cab ride. China Town and North Beach are also a short commute away. However, the name of this hotel is misleading: the building (and entrance) is located on THIRD STREET less than half a block off of Market. On account of my mom's birthday we were upgraded to a thirty-second floor bay-view room which was very comfortable. The posh beds, plasma TV, and easy-to-use coffee maker with Starbucks coffee were all impressive, not to mention the view. Unfortunately the tub did not drain properly and one had to shower standing in two inches of water; so I do not rate this hotel as excellent. We tried the restaurant, Ducca, once for a breakfast buffet; at $22.50 per person I suggest either ordering a la carte or simply going elsewhere as the buffet is overpriced for the food selection (limited hot selection and fruit). There are plenty of cafes and restaurants within walking distance, including several Starbucks stores.

The concierge refused to reduce the charge to one $15 delivery fee which is bad enough. In addition, they charged me for $29 in minibar charges when I had exactly $0 worth of items. Worst, they charged me twice on the same day for Internet access and refused to deduct one of the two charges. The Heavenly Shower is not bad but an overengineered gimmick.

My beef was that there is a typical thermostat in the room but it seemed that it is set with a very narrow range that the guest can change. I am ALWAYS cold, yet I could not turn down the thermostat enough to feel comfortably cool. I can't imagine how a hot blooded person would feel. Finally I turned it down 60 and still felt hot.

We are Gold Starwood Preferred Guests and this hotel was not able to extend a late check-out nor was it able to upgrade our room category upon arrival. Although I understand that this hotel caters generally to business travelers, for leisure travelers, I would not pay more than $200 for a Standard Room, even during peak-times in San Francisco. We booked this room initially for over $300 per night but two days before arrival the rate lowered to $199, as went as low as $159 several hours before check-in. For business travelers that will have their expenses reimbursed, then I guess it would not matter what rate you are paying. When calling the hotel directly, it takes the hotel operator sometimes in excess of 10 rings to answer a call. I am not sure if this hotel offers its guests' Concierge services but I would be sure to inquire about it before making plans to stay here if you are going to require the assistance of a Concierge. We made no use of the fitness/spa or restaurant faculties so I will not comment on those aspects of the hotel. For your information, valet parking at this hotel is $42 per night plus taxes. Hotel accommodation taxes is 14%. You can park your car across the street in a public parking garage or turn into the Four Seasons alley way and find the Jesse public parking garage where you will pay $20 max/ per day. Be advised that the Jesse parking garage closes at 10 or 11 and DOES NOT open until the next morning. Your car WILL BE stuck until the next morning so if you will be needing your car throughout the night, do not park here. Check-in at this hotel is consistent with any other convention hotel. It was busy and the check-in staff did not honor their priority check-in line for Gold/Platinum Starwood Guest members. The Standard Room we were given was on the lower floors of this 36 floor hotel and our view was of another rooftop's A/C unit. We were looking down the alley way of the Four Seasons where their guests bring their cars to valet park. It was really a small room. Generally I prefer to stay at hotels where rooms start out at 400-500 sq ft in the Standard Room category but this hotel's standard guest room was half that size. There was a king bed, a desk/chair, a dresser with a flat screen television, and a bath with shower/tub combination. It was not very well ventilated, even with the air conditioning set at 65 degrees throughout the entire during of the stay. The toiletries are of the Westin brand variety (not really good) and all the sheets and towels are available for sale and made exclusively for the Westin hotel chain. If you are a tall individual you may feel that your head may hit the ceilings as they are set really low. We left the DND sign on our door and housekeeping honored the sign so I can't comment on that aspect of the hotel's service. You have an option of whether you want your sheets changed daily or left alone for the entire duration of your stay. We did order room service: three drinks, an entree and one order of an appetizer came up to around $80 dollars. A significant portion of our bill went to taxes, fees, and gratuities. The food was average but it did come up in half an hour. The bell-desk is ALWAYS busy. The valet brought up our car in less than five minutes. We were left waiting for a housekeeping attendant to bring down something we left in our room, granted it was our fault, but it took 10-15 minutes from when we made the call for someone to be sent down. I thought it was an excessive amount of time but maybe it should be expected. Check-out, like check-in took a fair amount of time of waiting as well even though there were 3 front desk agents and 3 guests in front of us. We waited probably 10-15 minutes to check-out. Again, they did not honor their priority check-in/out line for Gold/Platinum guests. The bill they sent up to our room before check-out was correct so there was no need to dispute anything about the bill. The location is excellent and I it would be a fair assessment to say that this hotel is able to get the job done when all you need is a clean and comfortable place to stay while in San Francisco; however, if you want a more personable hotel, this is not the place to stay. And like I mentioned above, for leisure travelers do NOT pay more than $200 for a Standard Room, I assure you unless you are upgraded to a better room, you will regret it as the price is not consistent with the value that you may expect.

Of course, this is San Francisco and there are great food options very close so keep that in mind in picking your rate. The gym was nice and expansive for a hotel gym.

Two chairs, a short, shallow sofa, huge wooden coffee table, work desk and chair, and a dresser with TV make up in the living room. The bedroom had a king size bed, a chair, another dresser with a TV on it. Both the living area and bedroom had flat screen TVs. The closet in the bedroom is miniscule and the closet in the living area was locked. No clock in the living area, only on the clock radio in the bedroom. My 16th floor suite had nice floor to ceiling windows on two sides, but looked over numerous ugly rooftops. The bed wasn't as soft as I remember, and that was my reason for choosing the hotel. There is a beautiful work desk in the living area though, lots of plugs if you are a business person with many electronics! I brought my laptop and the WiFi worked great (extra charge, of course!) There is a mini bar with sodas and drinks in the corner of the living area. Coffee maker with coffee and a CD player. My room wasn't ready when I first arrived, so I left my bags and went out for awhile (the lobby is, indeed, very dark). When I returned, I found out the restaurant didn't open until 5:30 for dinner. I had been walking for a couple of hours and was very hungry by about 4:30. The nice doorman pointed me towards Thirsty Bear, a Spanish restaurant just a block or so away. Delicious food there. I loved the showers at the Westin. They have two shower heads. Since I travel solo...always plenty of towels! The bathroom was fine with soap, shampoo, conditioner, makeup mirror, hairdryer. Nice marble counter and floor, which makes for a cold floor...but...did you know standing on a cold floor in bare feet, if you have a leg cramp makes it feel better? That is a helpful tip when you are walking up and down hills in San Francisco! Another reviewer said that you had to weave your way through numerous cars that are parked in front of the Westin's entrance. Correct. Later in the evening, when I came back from the theater about 10pm, I could barely get from the sidewalk to the door, there were so many cars. However, I did find the front desk, room service, and everyone who assisted me in person or on the phone to be very polite and helpful. A late checkout was graciously handled for me. They have WiFi (charge) and in room movies (you'll pay more for one than if you went to the theater yourself). I had room service twice, both for a late snack and breakfast. The food was fine and the service was friendly. The hotel is nice enough, I found it quiet except for sirens from the street at all hours. Close to everything and the room was exceptionally clean. All things being equal, I think if I came back, I'd try another hotel. Nothing against the Westin, really.

The location cannot be beaten; four minutes walk from the South Side of Union Square and just round the corner from the Four Seasons and opposite the Fantastic San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, with the new and unmissable Olafur Eliasson light show. Wired web connection was easy to access, swift and affordable ($15.99) though if you just need to check emails, pop over Market Street to the Apple store where you can get online for a few minutes free. Two tips; if you are renting a car, get a Hybrid (Prius) as they charge half price ($22/night) for these environmentally friendly cars vs. $42 for a regular vehicle. Second: if you go to Macy's take your room key and out of state ID to Customer Services for an 11% discount.

As other reviewers suggested. This hotel has a nice , new gym at 4th floor, no swimming pool tho (Very common in norcal).

I explained my predicament to the manager, whose staff was mostly on break in anticipation of the lunch rush. He sat me at the bar, went to the kitchen himself, rustled up a snack and a cup of coffee for me and brought it to me within minutes.

Right in the middle of shops as well as the Westfield shopping arcade just ten minute away. Office Depot is right opposite and there is a Starbuck just round the corner. Reception has a nice ambience and scent and hotel generally nicely decorated. Quite clean except I noticed a bit of wrapping left lying on a slightly dusty table in the elevator lobby throughout my 4-night stay. Check-in staff was efficient but did sense a cold tone when she mentioned Priceline. Hotel has a well equiped fitness room but small and a bit cramped. Strange thing is that there didn't seem to be a restaurant within the hotel, I could be wrong though. Conciege was very helpful when we tried to arrange transport to the airport. Valet parking was $40 plus + tax (ouch) but only used them for one night as rental car was to be returned the next day. I couldn't be bothered looking for a cheaper parking for that reason but did notice cheaper garages close by. Unless absolutely necessary, I would avoid driving in SF - a lot of roads are one-way.. Beside, public transport is the way to go to get around - cheap and easy to use and many options - just get a muni/bart pass. Front of hotel could get a bit chaotic as 1) small and 2) cars waiting to be parked are left everywhere, even onto the pavement. As the hotel was completely full, we couldn't get a king bed so settled with two queens. I stayed on 26/F so noise wasn't a problem but being on a very busy road, I can imagine lower floors can experience some noise from the traffic. My room was 2616 and I noticed all the other rooms are 'Starwood Preferred Guest' rooms (say so on the doors). Maybe that's why the room was relatively more spacious. Again simply and nicely decorated and clean. Room overlooking main roads. Being on a high floor, I was glad to see the tops of most surrounding buildings.. Bathroom was reasonably sized with towels and toiletteries refilled/replaced daily. Shower wasn't that powerful though. Small wardrobe with a safe and just big enough for our two cases.

The staff seemed overwhelmed during check-in - which was about 6:30 PM on a Friday night. We had 4 bags (2 large and 2 carry-ons) and were at no time offered assistance or bellmen. When we asked about it - we were told that the wait was 35 to 40 minutes so we took our own bags up to the room. The room itself was fine. We were on the 26th floor and had a nice view of the city. The Westin is one hotel that charges a premium for internet service and it is not wireless- making it less than desirable for someone trying to transact business while staying there. In fact, we had to connect two separate times at a double price of $14.95/day. They still have not credited the first bill although they told us that they would take care of it. The hotel --although refurbished is showing signs of wear and tear. The carpet was frayed and bald in areas- and the furniture marred and chipped. There were several large groups staying at the hotel. On Saturday night- one of the took over the entire lobby area, monopolized the elevators and the lobby absolutely reeked of marijuana. No one at the hotel seemed to care or take any steps to do anything about it. There was a large pool of vomit in one of the elevators that was left there for at least an hour because my husband encountered it a second time when he went down to the lobby to print boarding passes. Speaking of boarding passes- one of the consierges tried to charge my husband $20 to print two boarding passes (something that EVERY hotel does as a courtesy) and sent him to an Instant Print place around the corner because they charged less. Another consierge heard him and agreed to do it for no charge. My husband was wondering just how many people agreed to pay the exorbitant charge just to do this simple task. Checking out- once again - no bell men. They also did not take my Priority Club card stating that they had no record of it when I had the card in hand. All-in-all, although the hotel was a bargain and the room adequate, the treatment from the staff was nothing short of rude and the other guests in the hotel (drunk, obnoxious, and out of control) made the visit less than enjoyable. At a minimum, when I go to a hotel that is rated a 4 star, I would expect good service at check in and check out and a safe., clean environment in common areas.

The location, just on the corner of Market and Third, is convenient to Union Square, the Embarcadero, SF MOMA, and PacBell. If you're interested in such things, Starbucks is directly across the street to the left. The rooms were clean and comfortable and had, of course, been given the full \"Westin treatment\" with the heavenly bed, typical desk, and so forth. While the bathrooms in some Westins have both the walk-in shower and separate tub, ours did not, though they were clearly working with the old Argent layout. Still, the bathroom was spotless and the shower/tub was newly tiled with marble. Service, both at the desk and by phone, was friendly and courteous, there is a good-sized gym (with a lot of cardio equipment) on the fourth floor (at least I think I'm remembering that right). The new northern Italian restaurant off the lobby is good, but with so many other options in the city, I would look further afield. At least during our stay, they did not yet serve brunch. Parking at any SF hotel is pricey and the Westin is no different.at $42 plus tax. That said, there is a garage across the street where you can self-park for roughly half the cost. The only downside? The minibar fridge was one of the new ones without any space for your own items and the \"you move it, you pay\" setup. Material in the room, though, said that the property had a limited number of mini-fridges available free of charge, if needed. When we asked for one, it was delivered and set up in minutes. Unfortunately, it didn't work. Not sure if it was the outlet or the fridge itself, but we didn't bother to request a replacement. Perhaps we just got a lemon.

Upon arrival I was given the room rate of $336 for a one night stay. My confirmation (which I printed from their website) noted $189. They handled the issue in a professional manner. 2. Room: Clean and cozy. The glass on the work station needed to be wiped down. The furniture and bedding were upscale in appearance. The TV was freakishly small. It must have been an 18\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TV. I have a 52\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at home, so I felt like I was a teenager in my childhood bedroom. I reserved a Deluxe room with king bed.

It needed a featherbed as you could feel the springs thru the padding. The sheets were standard, say 210 thread count. The pillows were down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c big bonus. If I had to rate on a scale of 1-10, the bed was a 6. A simple featherbed liner and higher thread count sheets would make a huge difference. 4. Bathroom: Nothing special. Standard tub. The water took about 10 minutes to go from cold to hot. 5. Hallway noise: The ice machine was located across the hall. Every hour or so, the ice machine would dispense a load of ice, which made a crashing sound. I woke up a few times during the night due to the noise. Try avoiding rooms next to the ice machine. 6. Location: Great location! Shopping 1 block away. Starbucks directly across the street. Liquor and munchies store nearly connected to the hotel. 24 hour 7-11 around the corner. Seriously, the location was the best. 7. Workout room: Nothing special. 3 treadmills, a few ellipticals, a recumbent bike, some weight machines. I would say this hotel is more like a 3.5 star hotel.

We had taken a 10 hour flight from Heathrow to San Francisco so were feeling very tired and weary when we arrived. We made the fatal mistake of leaving behind a bag in the taxi that dropped us off at the hotel from the airport. We didn't realise this until we walked into the hotel to check-in. The concierge were fantastic! They played back the CCTV footage, retrieved the cab number and registration plate, and managed to track down the cab driver. Thankfully, we managed to get our bag back, complete with contents, so in our eyes the concierge are our heros!! It took us a while to get checked in - even though there were only 2 people in front of us in the queue. Each time we walked through the reception area/lobby we always found lots of people waiting to check in/out. Once we got checked in we found that they had upgraded us to a deluxe room given it was our honeymoon. The room was spacious, had amazing views with floor to ceiling windows and a well stocked mini-bar. If we were to be picky, the only down side was the bathroom which, in our opinion, is in need of some modernisation. The bath wasn't particulary comfortable which is a necessity when you've been on your feet sightseeing for 8 hours each day! All in all, this was a lovely hotel and in a great location. We fell in love with San Francisco and it's people. Everyone went out of their way to make us feel welcome.

When i explained that we just flew in and needed to go right away to a conference session at Moscone, we had no problems checking in earlier than the normal check-in time. For \"discount\" Internet hotel reservations customers ---------------------------------------------------- After winning the bid for $125 per night at Priceline, i read numerous travelers' reviews of Argent. Since it seemed that, even with a discount, we might still be able to a nice room at a higher floor (which according to other reviews should be somewhere above 12th to 15th). We then took an early flight (from NY to SF) to avoid a late arrival, late check-in, and an unsatisfactory room assignment. A very nice, soft-spoken lady named Kathy greeted me at the registration front desk. While she was looking my name up, i asked her if it was possible for my husband and i to get something at a floor higher up. She asked whether we preferred a King or two Doubles, i picked a King, and without any problems she put us on the 15th floor! So my suggestion is, try your best to avoid late check-ins. Size of the room ---------------- Some travelers were saying that, when they lie in bed, they could literally reach the television with their toes :-) So we were anxious to find out what our room looked like. When we opened the door with the card, we were both WOWing! It was a corner room, and it was NOT small at all!! The first thing that caught my attention was the floor-to-ceiling glass window (as advertised on Argenthotel), and the view, while not looking at neither Bay Bridge nor Golden Bridge, was quite amazing as well. There were some highrise buildings a few blocks away (in most directions), and i am pretty sure higher floors could get better views of maybe the bridges, but overall the 15th floor is already not blocked by adajacent or across-the-street buildings. For the room itself and its layout, please see the pictures attached. (But i thought the pictures still do not show that the size of the room is great.) From my limited sense of direction in a city where i had never been, Room 1524 is very likely facing northeast. Also, through opened doors, i could see that other rooms on 15th floor are more like square layouts. They (e.g., Rm 1507) seem to be larger than the corner room(s), and they seem to have double beds. Internet access --------------- Some previous reviews were complaining that Argent charged $13 or so per day for Internet access. Interesting enough, a friend of mine who was staying at a nearby hotel told us that she was able to pick up some signals from the street, and we did! In Rm 1524 for instance, the signal was on and off in bed, yet remained rather stable on the desk by the window. The concierge ------------- The concierge at Argent now provides complimentary boarding pass printing (or e check-in). i did not know about this until i made a phone call to the front desk inquiring whether there was any charged document-printing service. What is lacking --------------- A swimming pool, since Argent is said to have a 4-star rating! And, one funny thing is, the hotel does not provide shower caps. They probably a hairdryer will do after people wash their faces :-) Transportations --------------- i believe most people do their homework before going to San Francisco Bay area, yet i still highly recommend paying $11 at the ticket station (Powell @ Market Street) for the one-day pass, which allows traveling on buses and cable cars.

He was able to procure reservations for us at prime times at two highly desirable restaurants. We had tried on our own to get into one of the spots, only to be told that the waiting list to eat there was \"months long.\" He definitely went the extra mile to make our stay unforgettable!

After much research we settled on the Argent for its location to the BART station, proximity to Union Square and Chinatown, and some good reviews here on Trip Advisor. We were really questioning why we decided to try something else from the moment we walked in the door. Nobody offered to help us with our bags which seemed odd but whatever. We then made our way over to the check-in counter. There were two people in front of that were waiting in line. They did not appear to be together and both looked quite puzzled. After waiting 10 minutes with nobody at the front counter to help us, I fear that we had the same puzzled looks on our faces. I finally asked them how long they had been waiting... 1 said about 10 more minutes than we had and the other simply said too long. My boyfriend then took a tour of the rather small lobby area to see if anyone was working that evening after no offer on the bags and a empty counter at check in. He found someone who must have made a call because only then did someone come out of the little office adjacent to the check in counter. He looked as if we had woke him up from a nap. We finally were helped after a 30 minute wait and the gentleman that checked us in was quite nice but still looked a little groggy. On to the room! We thought... THIS HAS TO GET BETTER. Well, not so much it turns out. The room was very small and very outdated. We were in 3224 which did offer a decent view but that is the only plus to this room. I completely agree with the other reviewer that said it was possible to change the channel with your toes from bed as it was that small. It is worth noting that we were in what was considered to be an \"upgrade\" room which is the deluxe. They have three categories standard, superior, and deluxe before getting into the suite category. So the deluxe was the best of the standard so to speak. I would have hated to see the other rooms. In closing, the only pleasant experience we had was with the doorman on our way out on the town two times. He was very nice. Who knows where he was the night we came in. There are far better hotels in SF for the price of this one. We will NOT be returning to the Argent.
