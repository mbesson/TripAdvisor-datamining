The first night we were on the 3rd floor. The room was very small but nice and clean but we asked to be moved because there was no lift. Breakfast is an experience! It was basic but actually lovely. The fresh ham was stunning. The second night we were put on the second floor down a wing. The rooms were much much bigger and the bathroom nicer. The hallway outside out room was so pretty. Fantastic base for being close to most things. They don't have tea facilities in room. We purchased a small travel kettle which was a life saver:) no bar as such but you've got loads nearby. Found Venice very beautiful - the grand canal but on a gondola ride smaller canals show done of the worst of Venice and a but smelly to be honest. You gave to do it to say youve done it though. Getting to the hotel from airport wasn't too bad. We went to the customer services desk and purchased a return ticket on the public ferry which took us to the pier at Rialto bridge and hotel about 10 min walk. If u find the opera fenice, turn right passed the church then first left - dead easy when you finally find it.

We thought we knew how to find it (we had a map) but were lost and wandering for almost an hour with heavy suitcases in stifling heat going up and down bridges and a maze of laneways. You really do need to ask someone for directions to the \"Teatro La Fenice.\" (La Fenice Opera) This is one of two opera houses in Venice and the Hotel Ateneo is right nearby. Many locals can't tell you where the hotel is but they all seem to know where the Teatro La Fenice is. You CAN get a water \"taxi\" from the airport which is much more expensive but will take you practically to the door. There's no elevator so not ideal for elderly guests or for carting luggage up and down stairways. You have to lug your own suitcases. Our room was a family room for four which consisted of a double bed, a single, and a sofa bed that would be a couch if there were only three guests in the room. Not much room left for luggage. The bathroom door didn't shut completely. (We'd read a review before we booked and we obviously got that same room) Quite funny. It wasn't really a major drama for us. We had a view right over a canal which was sensational. We'd read reviews to say the rooms were not much more than cupboards and we did indeed see an example down one of the hallways - it really was just a single bed in there and nothing else, a window with no view at all, and no space for a person to stand, let alone a place for a suitcase. At least we did have room to move in ours. A buffet breakfast was included in our price which was quite okay but nothing brilliant and not a wide variety of choice - mainly cereals and breads. It is a very small and tight dining room which only caters to a few guests at a time. The girl on the front desk was lovely, helpful and friendly. The cleaning staff/dining staff (same people) didn't go out of their way to be nice to most guests but when they found out we were from Australia, you couldn't find lovelier ladies. The Hotel is really close to lots of restaurants and once you know where you are, it's an ideal location for wandering around, shopping, eating out and discovering what Venice has on offer.

When we got to Ateneo we were told that there are no rooms at the hotel but they have another building 10 minutes away. Ten minutes turned out to be 30 minutes and another building turned out to be another hotel Belle Arti which is located on different island. The reason we booked that hotel is because it is located right in the center of the city close to all attractions and everything else. Now we have to stay 30 minutes away from everything on another end of the town. We called ateneo and demanded to go back to Ateneo or another hotel near by . They said there was nothing available but tomorrow they will try to find something for us. Next morning we left the room and went for a walk, when we came back to Belle arti we were told that that our room is no longer available and it was given to somebody else. All of our stuff was thrown in the bags and moved to another hotel on another end of town.we never gave anyone any permission to come to our room and touch our personal stuff some of which was missing and most of which was damaged and the hotel staff felt like there was nothing wrong with that. we did not want to move again and waist another two hours of our vacation so we requested another room at that belle arti hotel but of course there were no more rooms available. there was one room at another hotel across the street named Domus Cavanis which they said is the same category hotel, but if you look at their website it said that its 1 star hotel. Fine, we just wanted it to be over. Next day i spoke to the owner but he felt no remorse and tried to blame it on another hotel.

My travelling companion and I paid 90 euro for a double room. Given that we were backpacking for six weeks, when we finally arrived at the hotel at around midnight (we got a little lost but the very helpful and rather attractive police helped us with directions) we were delighted to find that the hotel was clean, warm and secure, housed in a charming old building down a calle near La Fenice. No issues with the booking or the service even though we probably weren't the hotel's usual clientele with our dirty backpacks, greasy hair and general air of grottiness, given that the room we stayed in was usually priced at something like 800 euro a night (no joke!!!). The location is absolutely unbeatable, five minutes' walk off St Mark's Square so you can go out and enjoy all that the San Marco area has to offer and hop on a water bus to the other islands. People who don't like stairs or find it hard to climb stairs may not want to stay here as there is no lift but we were used to hauling around our 25kg backpacks everywhere so a couple of flights was nothing for us. The room itself was on the small side but we had no trouble moving around. Bathroom was great, excellent water pressure, hot water that never ran out, bidet (if you like that sort of thing), and a BATH - heaven. There was a wardrobe, tv, room service, minibar, dry cleaning/laundry etc. but all we really used was the bottled water from the minibar. A massive buffet breakfast was provided by the hotel and included in the charge of the room and kept us full until the afternoon. Rooms were cleaned every day. All in all I had a great time at this cozy little hotel and would recommend it - if you can get it at the right price.", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Newton, PA", "Title": "\u201cSmallest room ever...but great location\u201d", "Author": "CoconutMatilda", "ReviewID": "UR34502897", "Content": "Our room at Hotel Ateneo was smaller than many closets.

Be aware that this hotel is part of a chain and they do frequently send guests to different hotels to the one booked originally...read my review for Hotel San Moise for more info on this! Now down to the hotel. The room we were provided, as you can see from the pictures was gorgeous. We booked a standard room, but I get the feeling to keep us happy (read other review) they upgraded us to a more deluxe room...either way. Lovely. And spacious. Lovely furnshings. Hotel is in a good location. A bit hard to find, so i would phone ahead for exact directions, but this is normally the case with any venice hotel in the maze of alleys and side streets! Nice couple of resturants on your door step. Okay prices. One is more expensive than the other, but serves the best spinach and ricotta ravioli I have ever tasted! About 8 minutes or so walk to the main square of San Marco. Freidnly and helpful staff. Happy to keep your luggage after check out. They even tried to provide us with an adaptor when we asked where we could buy one. (Unfortuntely they didn't have one which converted from Aussie to Italian) Tip for female travellers. They provide a hair drier, but if you have hair which is thick or longer than shoulder length bring your own. It is very small and not very powerful or hot. It took me about 35 minutes to dry my hair when it normally takes 10... I know it seems like niggles to the males reading this, but ladies will understand! Breakfast is good and plentiful. Your usual continental. Crossiants, fruits, cheeses, hams etc: Nice. Stock up before your trip out to venice to save on funding! TIPS FOR VENICE: There are people who will try to sell you \"geniunine\" gucci bags on the street. It is tempting to buy yourself a real looking knock off, but if the authorities catch you buying one (there are also people undercover doing this) you will be fined 10,000EUROS. The gondola rides are VERY expensive. 80 EUROS for half hour, 100 EUROS for 45 minutes. The boats hold 6, so its best to go in as a group rather than as a couple. There are many city tours in venice, some include gondola rides at good prices. The hotel has loads of leaflets in reception to help you out with these type of activites. There are guys in and around the square who will try to sell you roses. Ladies if they hold it out to you, no matter how forcefully they push it in your hand, do not take it. Once you have hold of it they will not take it back and they will hassle you or your partner for payment for it.

I wanted to do a lot of thinking and not write bad things out of emotion. So now I'm calm. And I still feel the same. Neither my friend nor I have EVER been treated so poorly by any hotel. We booked a room online. I don't know what happened, but when we got there they said the reservation was for 1 person, not two. I didn't know what to say. We thought we had a place to stay & this was upsetting. So, I just said \"Well, do you not have room for two of us? Because if not we need to go find another place to stay.\" Thing is, rather than being courteous, the man at the front desk, Massimo, seemed IRATE that we were inconveniencing him with two of us. He begrudgingly said he did have room, so we went on our way up to it. The room was fine. But it had 3 beds. I knew something was up since there were only two of us (we can only sleep in one bed at a time, we obviously didn't need the third). Sure enough, when we went to check out he tried charging us twice what we had been expecting. I said it was ridiculous. He kept saying, \"You book room for ONE! I cannot charge you for one!\" I said that I never expected him to, but that what he was charging was FAR more than what a double should cost. Especially since when we checked in we said we would be fine with two twins or one king. Finally, he screamed for us to \"SHATTAAPPPPAAAA!\" and kept going on about how when people like me make mistakes the hotel always suffers. I told him I wasn't trying to rip anyone off, and he turned and snipped, \"I am trying to WORK. DO YOU NOT WANT ME TO WORK? STOPPA TALKING.\" At this point, a crowd of older people had gathered in the lobby and was frozen with fear around us. I started to get REALLY angry because his attitude was NASTY, but my friend calmed me down. She asked who the owner was. He said \"Massimo.\" Then we asked where Massimo was & he said \"I AM MASSIMO.\" We looked at eachother and rolled our eyes. In the end, Massimo ended up acting like a pathetic, angry martyr and giving us the single room rate, which we didn't even ask for or ever expect. So it was good we spent less than we were expecting, but we ended up spending the extra money on wine to calm ourselves down. We were REALLY offended & upset (not how you want to spend your vacation time). I'd rather have just paid more and been treated with kindness and respect by the staff. Moral of the story... do not stay there. If you have to, tell Massimo we said hello. Preferably with the back of your hand held up in the air. Seriously, I've never felt so offended by a hotel's staff... and i\"ve been to 23 countries in my life. I stay at hotels all the time. This guy Massimo is an angry, angry, bitter man.
