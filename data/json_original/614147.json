The only downside is they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vacuum clean your room every day. Location depends on your needs and interests in Istanbul, but with a walking distance to nearest tube / metro station and reasonable taxi prices in Istanbul you can get to anywhere you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like. Although, Residence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location is very central. Nisantasi, Taksim, Sisli, Levent, Besiktas and Bosphorus is in one or two tube stations away. But, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a historical sightseeing in Istanbul, you would better choose a hotel in historical peninsula. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still close enough to visit those attractions though. The residence is on a one-way, small but busy street. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shortcut between two big roads, so expect some continuous traffic flow. As an extra, there is a building construction across the street and causes some noise pollution. So you better get a room facing courtyard, not street. The breakfast was simple but sufficient. The breakfast staff were polite and very obliging. The breakfast room was pleasant and hygienic with decent views. Rooms are modern, spacious and clean. You get what you see on their website. No funny business about it. The only flaw for me was air conditioning unit in rooms. It's not individually controlled system and you get what the central heating system gives you. I really would prefer an individual air conditioner in rooms, in terms of what I am paying for per night. Staff & Service is perfect. They are very professional, kind, practical and quick.

As I was staying here for 10 days, it felt like my apartment. The decor is clean and neat and modern. The drawbacks in the room are a few. The tv is very small, and perched up at a height where you can't see it from the bed. Even from the sofa, it is far too small. The cable system was also a little complicated.
