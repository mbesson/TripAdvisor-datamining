Booking was easy- we made an enquiry about availability on the website www.cafelice.com and had a prompt reply. Hugo, the owner asked for 100 euro electronic payment or credit card details as a deposit. We gave credit card details but paid the full balance when we arrived. Hugo gave us his mobile number and we agreed to meet at 11:00am on the Rialto bridge. We phoned him when we got there and he said he was just finishing the washing up at his b&b. He was with us in 2 minutes. He showed us the way to the apartment The apartment is a very short walk from Rialto on an alleyway just off the main Rialto-St Marks route. First impressions were good, it was very clean, spotless in fact (the cleaner was just finishing off as we were there a little early). The one down side is the lack of light. There are 2 big windows in the living room and the bathroom and bedroom have big windows. The bathroom and bedroom windows overlook a narrow canal and the living room overlooks the alleyway, our apartment was on the 1st floor, the buildings around are 3 or 4 storeys high so it was difficult to see the sky. This would be a great bonus on the height of summer as it would be nice and cool. However, with heavy rain forecast for the entire time we constantly felt it was dull outside and lights were on most of the time. As it turns out, it rained only half a day, but it meant us sticking our head out of the window to check. The bathroom is nicely tiled with quality fittings. The shower and wc and bidet are seperated from the basin area by a sliding door which in turn has a sliding door to the living room and to the bedroom. This makes the apartment very flexible if there more than 2 people using the apartment (the sofa in the living room converts into a sofa) as both rooms have independent access to the bathroom. Overall we think the apartment would be on the smaller side for 4 adults. The kitchen is in a cupboard. There is a full size fridge with freezer compartment, two electric cooking rings, and a sink with draining board. Washed up dishes can be left to drain in the cupboard above the sink. There is also a small microwave. My wife suggests it would be difficult to cook more than a basic pasta meal with these facilities (which we did once but enjoyed eating out at the other times. Our overall impression is that this apartment is perfectly located, it was great each morning to emerge out of our quiet alleyway on to a busy thoroughfare with busy venetians rushing to work mingling with tourists making their way between the sites. The apartment was perfect for our needs and would stop here again. The artwork in the living room is Hugos own work. It is worth visiting the apartments just to see the picture of Hugos wifes face created using dominoes!!", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Residenza Ca Felice", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d1654145-Reviews-Residenza_Ca_Felice-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$132 - $224*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">CASTELLO 5668</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30122</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1654145", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/2d/cd/d5/cappuccino.jpg"}}
