It is very small, quiet and felt like staying in someone's house rather than an hotel. Our room was bright and cheerful, the bathtub in the middle of the room. Definitely for couples only!!! We ordered breakfast up to our room every morning and the coffee, fruits and croissants were delicious as was the presentation of all silver service pieces. It was fun to walk around the area, go to the Portobello Road antique market, look in to all the lovely shops, and some cozy and delicious restaurants. We could walk to Kensington Palace, and the bus stops to everywhere were a block away, and taxis bountiful. I highly recommend to people who want to avoid the hustle and bustle of being in heart of London, and want to hear birds chirping in the morning and flowers blooming everywhere.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cAll that glitters is not...............\u201d", "Author": "ac4941", "ReviewID": "UR118960511", "Content": "I had been invited to a very special friend's birthday party. One of those '0' ones so i knew it would be a late do, so sensible to stay over I thought. Checking around I came across the Portobello, which just happens to be in the next street to where I was going, Have a look on their web-site, I did, it looks great. About 3 weeks before the event I rang to book a room, now I should point out that they aren't cheap \u00a3145 (ex VAT) for a single up to \u00a3315 (ex VAT) for the best. The cheapest double works out at \u00a3234 inc Vat, but the 20% offer mentioned on the website apparently only applies to bookings made on the day, a novel way of pricing thought I! I found another bookings site which actually showed the number of rooms available and tracked that so I did book on the morning of the day I was staying and got the room for \u00a3200 inc. You have to look for it in Stanley Gardens, but the ubiquitous 2 Bay Trees gave it away so I pulled up on the yellow lines outside (it was a Sunday) and went in to check in. The young lady on reception was having a blazing row with some other guests who seemed to be having a row themselves, but that's life, so when she gave me that look which sort of implies that I had no right to be on the same planet as her I put it down to her recent experience. How wrong can you be! The welcome is neither warm or polite, but check in I did and then asked (because it wasn't offered) if someone could help me in with my bags. Someone was (after a very audible tut) summoned. I went up to the room! Small didn't come into it, how 2 people manage I'd love to know, then I looked at the bathroom! Tired would be polite. It had a toilet, facing the shower room with a washbasin in between, not so much a room, more a corridor! Having driven for 2 hours I made use of the facility, but I could not get the flush to work. I knew I had to move my car so I went down to reception and explained about the problem with the flush, only to be told that 'I had to push hard' Not sure she was happy when I said that for \u00a3200 per night I didn't push hard on anything, but she said she'd get someone to look at it whilst I sorted my car out. On my return I was assured that someone had been up to the room and was again advised to 'push hard' On the plus side this Hotel does have complimentary wifi and that was easy enough to get connected too. Early October this year was unseasonably warm, the hotel doesn't suffer from air conditioning and my little room was getting hotter so I thought I'd have a shower. That was a challenge. Firstly you have to climb into it, secondly to get to the tap you have to close the door, thirdly the cubicle is so small you can't avoid the water, end result you either get very cold water or very hot! Not bad for over \u00a3200 eh! It's impossible to dry yourself off in the bathroom so back into my now even hotter pen where I changed into my party outfit, sweating profusely and I set off for the party. On the way through reception I mentioned the heat and without a smile I was told that they could put an air-conditioner in my room and, fair enough it was there when I got back. These portable units could not be described as quiet and to use it you have to open the window and doing that lets in the loud traffic noise from Kensington Park Road, a bus route and hilly at that point too. So the choice was sleep cool, but be woken by the noise, or sleep warm, I opted for warm, although as they haven't yet found double glazing the noise element is still very much there. I watched some tv, marveling at the way the wiring to the wall mounted set had been done in black with no effort made to conceal it, sent down for a glass of wine which was served by the same guy as sorted out my luggage so I assume they run the place on 2 people with some chambermaids in the morning. Continental Breakfast is included in the rate and you can have it served in your room, but as there was nowhere to sit and not being a breakfast fan I skipped it, maneuvering round the shower was challenge enough! There is a mini-bar, they charge for water which is not stored in the fridge. Wardrobe space is at a premium, if you are staying more than one night and there are 2 of you, you'll struggle They do use duvets on the beds though which I thoroughly approve of. Would I go back? No Would I recommend this hotel, no unless you really do want to be in that particular part of Notting Hill and your stay is short.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cReasonable choice\u201d", "Author": "owenh_60", "ReviewID": "UR118862489", "Content": "It's a few minutes walk from nearest tube quite nice entrance.

We explained that we had contacted the hotel and they had our card details and that it was our wedding night (I was wearing the dress - we clearly had NOTHING no bags) so everything had been taken to the room already. The receptionist made me stand there while my husband ran up to the room and rooted round to find the right bag and find the card. He then didn't even take payment, he just swipped it! Possibly the least romantic start to a wedding night possible. I understand places have processes but when we had already provided the card details and 2 people had been to drop off our bags, and they KNEW it was our wedding night, you might have expected slicker service. You might think that it being our wedding night there would be a nice bottle of bubbly waiting in the room, not a chance! The room was nice, all the rooms in this hotel are. We had pre-ordered a champagne breakfast and been set an expectation that this came with a full bottle of champagne. It didn't, just a half bottle. It wasn't cheap either and quite mediocre. Oh, and they overcharged us, we had to rush off so then have been trying to sort out retrospectively. I would absolutely warn against booking this hotel if service is important to you.

So here is the GOOD the BAD and the UGLY on the Portobello Hotel. The GOOD: This hotel is in a fantastic location. Notting Hill is beautiful with great shops and charming streets and one of the cities oldest pubs. The Saturday street market is not to be missed. The market is one of the best things to do on a Saturday morning in Central London. Thousands of people with great bargins to be found. Lots of fantastic food. Walk the street while drinking your coffee and end at the other end of the market drinking in the pubs. PEOPLE watching galore! The hotel is small and fairly charming. Its sits on a quiet beautiful street. The garden in the back is private to the neighbors. Nice to look out on. We were there during Guy Faux Eve and the kids stayed up til 3 am shooting off firewoks in the garden...not very quiet that night but very civilized for a neighborhood. The bed was great. We stayed in the four poster bed room. It had a nice amount of space compared to most London standards. The tub was extra long but nothing special to look at. The room had a coffee maker with tea and cookies...nothing special. The unit was dirty and outdated. The BAD: The rooms are way over priced. For close to 600.00 we could have stayed in many nice hotels in London with service to boot. The service here was TERRIBLE! The small staff acted as if you were not there in front of them. If you politely aked them a question they ignored you or said they couldnt help you out. It seemed like they were bored and were there waiting for movie stars to cater to. Even the simplest of questions they could not answer. They were uninformed about the neighborhood and frankly most of London. The breakfast was pretty dull. How can you mess up toast? If you order organic tea they charge you several extra dollars which is billed to your room. Even though tea is supposed to be included in the breakfast??? This puzzles me because if this is such a hip hotel why arn't all the teas organic? The price of an egg was insane and the breakfast room was lack luster with uncomfortable chairs. We opted out the second morning and found several charming brunch and breakfast places in the near vicinity of the hotel. The hallways can be noisey as other readers have said. Be prepared for anything. Getting a cab was difficult. It seemed like the communication system for this hotel was terrible. The UGLY: The bathroom was so tiny only one person could stand in it at one time. The door to the plastic shower moved in such an awkward way that you had to stand almost outside the bathroom to get in it. Water splashed everywhere soaking the entire tiny floor. The sink was so tiny water splashed out constantly. The floors were moldy! Lets put it this way, the entire bathroom needed a face lift. The tub sat outside the bathroom and as I mentioned earlier was nice and long but also very cheaply constructed. The two closets for clothing were in this area of the bathroom and were filthy and tiny. The t.v. reception barely came in. Good night! Go visit Notting Hill for the market, the shops and the pubs but not this hotel.

I picked the Royal Four Poster room, room 13. This room costs \u00c2\u00a3295 per night with continental breakfast. When booking the hotel i had lovely service over the telephone, but when we got there it was another story. We arrived at the hotel and there were other people already in the small reception area. We waited for around six minutes while 2 staff members ignored us...finally on checking in they dissmissivly (is that a word??) said \"there's the lift or the stairs\". No offer to help with our heavy bags up the stairs. The hotel is a little tatty around the edges but i feel it adds to its charm. We got to our room which was lovely with lovely views. The widescreen tv that was promised was positioned at the side of the bed so that it was almost impossible to view anyway!!

This continued for most of the night and to rub salt into the wound, my jealousy was piqued even more the next morning when we bumped into them on that self same corridor and discovered that they were not, as we had imagined, in the first flush of energetic youth, but rather were somewhat older than our good selves ( early middle age !! ) So beware...the Portobello DOES have a surprising effect on some people, although I do imagine that it depends greatly on your choice of room-mate !!!", "Date": "April 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, UK", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "campbell88", "ReviewID": "UR7414362", "Content": "We stayed for two nights in one of the Moroccan rooms on the top floor.

Breakfast was great - continental and delivered to your room although I agree with some of the other comments on this site it is really pushing it to charge \u00c2\u00a315 extra for a full English and seems 'cheap' when you have spent a couple of hundred on a room for the night. The location swung it for us. We had not been to this area of London before and loved walking around the leafy avenues.

Having previously stayed in the wonderful 'Covent Garden Hotel' the previous year, we were all sorely disappointed with the Portobello. I imagine that some of the rooms must be of adequate size and decorated to a good standard, but our 2 rooms were the shabbiest of chic that could be imagined. The carpets were filfthy. The units were falling apart and the mini-bar fridge looked like a student digs reject. The room just about fit the very springy (not in a good way) bed and the bathroom was so small that when I opened the door and walked in with my arm out-stretched to find the light switch, I hit the opposite wall. To make matters worse, when I checked in I was sent to the top of the stairs unassisted and told that our rooms were on the left. I opened the door and knocked a workman off his ladder who was fixing the lift. The carpets had been pulled back and I couldn't get the door fully open to even get to our room. Why didn't they think to tell me? Just as I had finished unpacking and was onto worrying about what everyone else would think when they arrived, I was asked to move to another room. It just went on really. When I spoke to front desk about the rooms and asked if there were any others that we could swap to - even pay extra money for, as it was a special occasion and that the photos they publicise are misleading - I was told that they had not had complaints before and had nothing else available. They also said they were unable to offer any sort of compensation. The saving grace was our wonderful meal at 'Julie's' (owned by the same people as the Hotel) and the actual area itself. If you are considering paying this sort of money and are looking for something special, I would recommend looking at availabilty for 'The Covent Garden Hotel' first and then getting a cab to 'Julie's'.", "Date": "October 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Luxury\u201d", "Author": "World_barbarian", "ReviewID": "UR5802474", "Content": "Stayed at the Portobello during September 2006 and it was a fantastic stay.
