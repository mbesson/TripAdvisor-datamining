Upon entering the lobby, you immediately feel like you're somewhere tropical. The rooms are small, but nice and clean. We ate lunch at the outdoor restaurant, which was good and convienent. The pool is definitely the selling point of this hotel. We hung out at the pool, enjoying cocktails and the steel drum music all day. Staff was courteous, and free parking is a plus. The ONLY downside is the location. It is on a main highway, and while mapquest says only a couple miles to Duval, cabs are expensive. The hotel always called a cab for us which, was nice, but we would have preferred to be near Duval.

Was it a seasonal issue, any other reason - no ideas. Anyway for 350 usd a night for a standard room I wold expect a lot more. THE GOOD They do have a large pool, free parking area, breakfast is available at their restaurant, actually they do have everything you need - a shelter (room), meal, pool. THE BAD The place is situated faraway from the attraction sites and you won't be able to get there by feet. More than 3 miles, part of the way with no sidewalk while being on the main way - traffic is heavy. You do not want to walk there in the evening. We had a car and went to the main city walking area and parked there easy. As already noted by somebody it is really hard to drive out even if you turn right. My main concern was it was noisy there. In the night. Early morning they star to pick up the garbage or whatever - wake up call, Sir! Although you did not request it. The chicken.. OH, the chicken...They do have chicken everywhere. Especially at your window at the time the sunrise is to come. And they work hard. I mean they do sound good. Noway you miss your early breakfast. Part of the roms face the ocean - mean it the main road, the rest face the pool area and the back yard. We stayed on the back. The room is so small you hardly walk along the bed to reach the bathroom. The building is a 2-floor one with visible aging signs. No wireless internet available in the rooms (is it XXI century?). No meal available in the evening. Breakfast excluded from the price. The reception staff did not appear really nice and accomodating although gave short reply to my every question. Still I felt like disturbing them from talking to each other. So all in all I was not comfortable there and still wonder why did I choose to stay there and what did I pay for?

Most of the rooms are situated in back so you don't have the traffic sounds and it is nicely secluded with many palms! The pool area was outstanding as was the outdoor bar with wonderful drinks! The employees were very helpful and considerate. The air-conditioner was rather loud and a service tech came within minutes of our call to clean it out and add another filter, really didn't help lower the sound however. Our in-room coffee pot didn't work and was immediately replaced along with extra coffee. We were fine with the location being 3 miles from Duval St. as we had rented a car and had known this. The concern I would have is that the Inn is positioned on a curve and was very hard to get out to the main street. There was a roll-over accident coming back one evening, much caution needs to be used. We did investigate the road in back of the Inn and it took us to one of the main intersection with lights....a definite plus. The hotel personnel should mention this! Room cleaning service does need improvement only in the area of it happening sooner. We stayed 4 nights and 3 of those they came around 4:00 when we were coming back and wanting to get ready for the evening. Now for the UGLY.....we didn't realize \"Spring Break\" started in the beginning of March. There was some pounding on the Inn's doors and yelling when some of the kids returned from the bars at 4:15 in the morning. We did report this and a security person came immediately. This, I'm sure, happened at many other places as well.

It was a nice hotel - not new - but clean and good size rooms. The lobby is nice and has a small business center/computer area. We had a two-bed unit on the second floor, unfortunately away from the pool. The hotel is on a busy road, and the sidewalk is across the street. The pool was great, better than the pictures show. Very tropical, plenty of pool side chairs, a cabana area, and a tiki bar. Tim, the bartender, was really friendly and gave us lots of Key West tips. We made sure to stop back the following evening when we knew Tim was working again. There was a small workout room in the hotel, which I had practically to myself both days. The poolside restaurant had good breakfast food. First day our food came quickly; the second day, not so much. Too bad the breakfast wasn't included in the overnight stay. What the others mentioned about the resident parking lot rooster is true--he starts out early in the morning, until everyone is out of bed. The hotel is about 1 1/2 miles from Duval Street. We took a taxi downtown both evenings for less than $15 each way. Both times the taxi picked us up within 5 minutes. Downtown parking is spotty and the parking meters run 24/7and aren't cheap, so we felt the taxi was well worth it.

Go online and get the schedules, they come every 20 minutes or so. Perfect for taking down to Duval when you want to go. The buses stop relatively early, so grab a cab home. Costs $15 with tip.

We reserved a \"Premier Queen Room, (2 queens in the main building), and requested the pool side on the second floor as we were wary of highway noise on the other side. (We originally considered this side for the Ocean View, until we realized that THE main road in Key West, HWY 1, is right there! On the day of our arrival, we called about halfway down the keys to confirm our reservation and request. We were told that there was one \"Premier Queen\" room available on the poolside, second floor, but they didn't \"reserve rooms\". When we arrived the only available rooms were on the Highway side. He said they had three available on the second floor, so not knowing anything about the rooms, I asked him to choose the one he thought was best. When we went up to the room we realized that there was NO VIEW, because of large palm trees directly in front of the balcony! So we got all the highway noise and none of the view. Not happy, I went back down to see about changing to one of the others. The first guy was busy with someone else and the other guys initial response was \"we don't guarantee a view\". He finally gave me a different room, but it to had the same problem! The third room, available when we first checked in was taken by someone else while we were going back and forth, and it had a view! So, I asked the desk clerks opinion and paid for it!! We were told we could check into switching the next day as we were staying two nights. We did that first thing the next morning and were told that are things would be moved for us during the day while were out. When we returned that night, after being gone all day seeing Key West for the first time, we discovered that NOTHING had happened. When I asked about it, another new person at the desk professed to know nothing about it, and said they had nothing available. We stayed again in the same room. I was very disappointed and frustrated, (didn't throw a fit though), and sensing that she called up to us a half hour later and said she had adjusted our bill down to compensate. I appreciated that, but would have rather stayed on the other side for the original price. She is the ONLY front desk person that did anything positive for us. (I don't consider an unfulfilled promise, positive). In short, the poolside is worth the price in the main building, but I the highway side is definitely NOT, in my opinion.

The bedspread had blood stains, including streaks of blood on it. I left a note for housecleaning, but it was still not changed. I had to call down and request a replacement. I didn't see any indications of bed bugs, but the streaks of blood were disconcerting. The TV was broken when we got to the room, but the staff promptly fixed it. The toilet broke, but the staff promptly fixed it (kudos to a young Latin gentleman who singlehandedly took apart the toilet and brought it back to working order in a matter or minutes). The staff was as helpful as they could, but the property could use some work to bring up to 3.5 star quality that would merit paying $200/night. It is in New Town Key West, a short drive from old town.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201c5 star pool\u201d", "Author": "healsea", "ReviewID": "UR123567309", "Content": "I guess I echo most of the reviews here.

I've been to Key West before and near Duval can be rather noisy, so being ten min away from this area was okay by me but then again my husband doesn't drink, so that is always a plus to have a DD! The food was really good, breakfast excellent. The male Concierge (Bill, Bob, ?) was so helpful! He arranged our cameraman and snorkel excursion but it got cancelled due to high winds, he immediately ensured we would not be charged. He also recommend my most favorite and romantic night out - dinner at the Hot Tin Roof, we loved it! Thanks to him for that wonderful recommendation as it was our favorite night on the town. Another plus: We loved the secluded little whirlpool off to the side surrounded with a sandy beach-like atmosphere, very secluded with big lush green foliage and flowers.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Timetraveller49", "ReviewID": "UR121152521", "Content": "We stayed for the days at The Inn at Key West in late October and thoroughly enjoyed our time there.

We stayed during the final week of Fantasy Fest. The lobby of the hotel is beautiful. It makes you feel like your at an upscale beach resort from the moment you walk through the door. The hotel staff at the front desk were very helpful and quick, probably took us all of 5 minutes to check in. The pool area is wonderful and has a very tropical feel to it. There are random roosters walking around the property which kinda gives it a personality. They were never obtrusive during out time there. Our room was wonderful. They were quite spacious and the beds were not stuck to the ground so you could move them more towards the walls if you needed to for whatever reason. The bathroom was very nice as well. Only thing I didn't like was the fact that the doors couldn't be locked but this really wasn't a problem for us. They had a huge LCD TV in the room to go along with a mini-fridge in terms of amenities. Ladies leave your hair dryers at home, the room comes equip with one and a good one at that, not those crappy stuck to the wall ones some hotels offer. We were given room 148 which seemed to be perfect at first. First floor allowed us to unpack everything from the car rather quickly and the vending machines/ice machine is literally around the corner. Now the reason I gave this hotel 4 stars instead of 5. This room was located RIGHT NEXT TO the hotel staff's laundry room. We didn't hear any noise from the laundry room itself rather every morning we were awaken to the noise of countless of Maid carts making their way to and from this room. It was quite annoying but nothing that made our stay horrible in any way. We didn't even complain about it. As stated earlier the staff was very helpful. When we needed extra towels they didn't hesitate. When we needed to call a cab, the front desk handled it. We couldn't of asked for more from their part. Location wise this hotel is towards the beginning of the island, a $10-15 cab ride from Duval street. ($4.50pp if more than 4 ppl in the cab). There was a Publix, Mcdonalds, and IHop (basically on the property) all really nearby. All in all we would not hesitate in returning to this hotel if the price is right.

The thing we were most amazed with was that the website photos really are true to the hotel. Its exactly as you see it. The rooms are great. The beds are so comfortable! We saw some of the other hotels on the island that we had also considered booking and this hotel blows them away! It really is the best! It is located on the more luxurious and quieter side of the island. Great for romantic getaways. If you do want the hustle and bustle of the bars and bachelor parties then you are a $10-$15 taxi ride away from Duval St it's also a very nice bike ride. You can rent bikes for $10 for 9 hours and it's really great fun to tour the island. It's an easy ride. One thing we love about the hotel is that you feel like you are in a tropical rainforest with the amount of palm trees. They are so beautiful and frame the pool perfectly. Overall... this place is wonderful. On a side note, we did notice that one couple was so rude and displeased because of something so minor and the staff did everything they could to accommodate them but there is just no pleasing some people.

It is a great escape away from the crazy of Duval street. We stayed in a Deluxe King with a balcony over looking the pool and the room is very well appointed with lovely furniture and a nice bathroom. The only issue I can bring up is the air conditioning. We were there in August, and it is hot in the keys, We had to wait to check in to our room as it was being cleaned, so there was someone in prior so it is not like they turned the air off to conserve energy when the room was not being used. When we got into our room, the temp was set at 80 degrees and it was much warmer than that with the sun coming into the room. The rooms only have a small window type airconditioner you would see in a home, so it took over 1/2 our stay for the room to cool down. It was cooler with the door open to the hall way. It was hard to sleep the first night we were there. I am not sure if it is a directive by management to the cleaning staff to save energy or just a mistake, but need to make sure the temp is adjusted for guests checking in. Besides this, everything else was great...the pool is fabulous, they have a nice outdoor tikibar, that serves up great frozen drinks. We did not find the location an issue. We were there starting on a Sunday, so had not problem finding parking downtown. Also the free parking at the hotel was great.

Unacceptable and more than unwelcome. This is not service...this is downright insulting. Later we spotted a new man on reception who was James, from France, and we told him our tale.

Given the market, there is good value here though I still feel over charged. The only other major negative is its distance from downtown Key West. While it could be walked, it would be a very long walk. You will likely have to drive or arrange other transportation.

The hotel itself is about a 5 minute drive from the downtown core but it was nice to be away from it all. After a night of being on Duval coming back to this quiet retreat was a nice experience and allowed for a great nights sleep. The pool area (like most people say) is quite beautiful with great bar staff and a nice water feature that adds to the tranquility of it all. The drinks are worth every penny and the breakfast is quite nice. Of course there are other restaurants I encourage you to try but if you're looking for a quick bite to start your day off it's perfect. The rooms were well appointed with a flat screen tv, clean, and recently updated with new furniture. A few people mentioned a bad view of looking at the back of an iHop but i'm not quite sure how this is possible. The property is surrounded by greenery so it covers up the somewhat close restaurant. The gym is nice and has updated equipment and great for a quick workout before heading to the pool for some sun and swim. The lobby has computers for internet use but we found bringing your own personal computer to the pool or lobby was great since you could use their wifi. Just be warned using wireless net in the rooms can be a bit challenging as they use concrete to hurricane proof the rooms so getting a signal can be tricky. My only complaint was seeing garbage on our stairs outside of our room for consecutive days in a row. It had looked like someone spilled candy down our steps and it remained there for close to 3 days. There was also a used plastic up outside of our room on the railing for a couple of days. Our room was cleaned but always seemed to get a little later each day, one day being close to 3:00PM for a clean room. If that's that only thing I could find to complain about than this place was a big hit and I would highly suggest this hotel for your next stay in the Keys.

One occurs when you first drive up and get to see the property with your own eyes, not the retouched and pretty brochure photo version. The next occurs when you walk in to the lobby and get a sense of the hotel itself. The third is when you are greeted at the front desk (or not) and your room is ready upon your arrival (or not) ... Up to that point, things were good. And the front desk clerk did try to be helpful, although we now wish that we had just shown up later and gotten another room. Our room was at the back of the property, kind of a motel style with cars driving by, and we had the misfortune of being immediately next to the area where housekeeping staff and people using the laundry room take their breaks. This area stayed loud nearly all hours, day and night. Not to mention smoke coming into the room when the door was opened, and cigarette butts strewn everywhere. Very tacky. I suspect that the reason the air conditioning unit in the room is so loud (it sounds like a generator is running day and night) is to try to drown out the cackling and howling of the people on permanent break in the smoking area and noise in the parking lot. Unfortunately, it is just more noise that makes the notion of a quiet getaway an illusion. And of course, we were told at the front desk that they were sold out so we could not switch rooms. On our first full day in the room, we came back to the room in the mid-afternoon to rest up for an evening event, and housekeeping had not even touched the room. Eventually, around 4:30 pm or so someone came by to clean things up. With all the chairs at the pool taken up, and no towels available, it was slim pickings trying to enjoy the setting. To the credit of the hotel, it is a beautiful pool and overall the hotel has a nice, well-kept appearance. It is far away from anything and everything on Key West, with the exception of the IHOP which is next door. Speaking of doors, when we came back on Sunday evening the lock on our door (which looks like it has been forced open and is nearly off its hinges) was not working, apparently the result of a dead battery in the device. It took nearly an hour to get that sorted out, on a night that we needed to get to bed for an early trip back home. It wasn't anything that they hotel did wrong, it was just the icing on the cake. When we checked out, it was clear that the front desk clerk really could care less about our impressions of the property, or even whether we had a nice stay.

It's also about a 10-minute drive away from \"the action\" downtown and on Duvall Street, which is probably a plus (away from the hustle and bustle, probably cheaper) and a minus (a lot of \"commuting\" time to get downtown). We had asked for a room with two queens, and I confirmed the night before we got in that we'd have two queens. At check-in, were told that they had switched us to a king room with a fold-out sofa because it had an ocean view, which was an upgrade. We reluctantly agreed to it. The ocean view is really a view across U.S. 1 at a not-terribly-picturesque part of the oceanfront. And the noise from U.S. 1 (the main drag around the island) was a problem, with noisy traffic all night long--earplugs are a must. We probably should have insisted on the two-queen room, even without a \"view,\" but we stuck it out. On the plus side, the room that we received (Room 201) was about the largest room on the property, so it had PLENTY of room, and it was clean. The pool is terrific--the biggest on the island that we saw on any of the websites that we visited. Sometimes a bit tight on poolside chairs, but we were always able to get some for our family. The service at this place is not up to snuff. Not really rude, but \"diffident\" and \"unconcerned\" are probably the words to use, and we saw it from just about everyone--except for the staff at the cafe for breakfast, almost all of whom were quite nice. Nobody seems terribly interested in doing anything to help. An example: when my wife told the front desk that they were out of cups at the water dispenser in the lobby (5 feet from the front desk), the woman at the front desk told my wife where the plastic cups were located, rather than going to retrieve them. And when the cups weren't where they were supposed to be, the woman paged someone else at the hotel staff to go get them, rather than offering to find them herself.

The hotel was very nice. It looks just like the pictures, except for the lobby maybe. It didn't make me go \"ooo\" like the picture did. But upon closer look it was all the same...must have been the lighting. The check in process went fast. We asked about getting a king size bed, but I guess they aren't the type of hotel to do that for free when they aren't busy...so that was a bust. The workers all seemed very nice and polite. We didn't have one single problem so we never really had to talk to them. The room was really nice. There is a fridge, but it's kind of small so don't go crazy at the liquor store. Which are all over the place by the way. The beds are very very comfortable. The bathroom and sink area were nice. Absolutely every thing has been redone from the flood in 2005 (I think they said). Housekeeping came right at 11am every day to clean the room, and would come right back as soon as you left if you were still there. New towels were always left even though we hung ours back up. Not sure if they changed the sheets. Hopefully you aren't that dirty. There is a makeup mirror wich is always a plus. I'm not a huge fan of the little shampoos and stuff but they seemed to be of pretty good quality. The pool is amazing. It's huge with palm trees all over and even a little sandy beach area. There was a guy singing island sounding music during the day on Sat. and Sun. We used the hot tub twice and one time it was so hot I couldn't put my feet in. They do have beach towels at the pool. I had one frozen drink at the pool and it was really good. There is a small dining area next to the pool, but we didn't eat there. We glanced at the breakfast menu and it was $15 for the buffet. There are too many cool places closer to the main strip to eat at in my opinion. Now for going outside of the hotel. It is away from the downtown party area, but it is 10 min max and that's just because the speed limit does not go over 35 any where. I highly recomend renting scooters to go around. You can go to the lady in the lobby and she will set it up. They come pick you up from the hotel and drop you back off when your done..for just a tip. The company they used was $45 for 24hr and an extra $25 for extra days. Those prices are for the singles scooters. It was worth every penny. You can't help but smile on those things. Most every one is on bikes and scooters any way. We only took the car in to downtown twice and it was a pain to find parking where you didn't have to pay. Every thing on Duval is pretty expensive but if you go on the side streets it gets cheaper. We had great food and great drinks the whole time. They do not water any thing down that's for sure. They like to get their drink on so the bars and restaurants open pretty early and some of them had happy hours in the morning, noon, and night. All of the locals were extremely nice and wanted to know where you were from and told you about places to try. Being 28 and 31 we were some of the youngest people there. The beach and water is absolutely beautiful. It was just like Mexico, but without the waves. The hotel is for sure one of the top 5 on the island. There are a lot of house/inn type places. I guess you just have to know about those from experience. It was a great hotel and a great place to be. We will be back for sure. Probably try to make it to fantasy fest next year.

When my wife and I were in Tokyo this year, we stayed at a 5-star hotel designated as \"Expedia's Insiders' Select\", and we were very happy with it. It was the best hotel we have stayed in Tokyo, and we have been to Tokyo many times. So when I saw this hotel's reasonable price and the \"Insider's Select\" designation, I went for it, and we were not disappointed. The hotel is not near Duval street. It's about a 5-min drive, near the entrance to the US-1, which means it's really easy to find coming off the highway. The best part of this hotel is the pool. It is clean, surrounded by palm trees, and full of lounge chairs. There is a bar by the pool, though not a swim-up one. We stayed here for 3 nights and has enjoyed the pool a couple of times. (To hotel management: why don't you provide pool towels there as well? It will be great if you do) Near the pool is a small fitness room. I was impressed with how comfortable a little fitness room could feel. There are only four cardio machines, a weight bench with weights, and some medicine balls in the room. But all the cardio machines are brand new, with working TV screens. The room is very chilled and has a water cooler, towels, headsets, and another large flatscreen TV. The best part is, no one uses it. The room, while not big, is decorated with tasteful tropical, dark wood, furniture. There is a 42-inch flat screen TV hung nicely on the wall. The a/c works extremely well and the bathroom is nice. Our room faces the parking lot, which is good and bad. Good is that it's kind of secluded. I noticed that certain pool facing rooms are along the walkway to the pool and the breakfast rooms so there could be a lot of foot traffic. Bad is that we hear the roosters in the morning.

What previous reviewers accurately conveyed was true. A cab ride or a car is the quickest way to get down to Duval St. but we didn't have a car and didn't pay for a taxi. We bought a 7 day bus pass for $8.00 even though we only stayed there for 5 days. You will save tons of money but there is the bus schedule to seriously take into consideration. With my wife and I, time wasn't a big deal so we rode the bus all over. We take public transportation wherever we go because in addition to the cheap fare we also get the local flavor of the residents. The Hotel was absolutely gorgeous. For those who have been to a caribbean resort, you would appreciate the layout and scenery. We were given a an early checkin which was great but that same night after getting back to the room we found that the air conditioner wasn't working properly. We called the front desk and they had someone show up within 5 minutes which was great. He tried a couple of things with no success so he called the front desk and they moved us to an upgraded room in the main building which was a pleasant surprise. The larger room had a larger bathroom, an in room safe and the rain shower. To be honest I believe all rooms should have in room safes. The bed was very comfortable. High speed internet in room was spotty as was cell phone reception (carrier is verizon) Both signals were stronger in first room (#234). We didn't eat any meals at the cafe so I can't comment on the price, taste or selection. We walked over to the Publix and bought some food and walked down each morning to the McDonalds for breakfast. Also next to the hotel is a Wendys, Subway and I-Hop. They also have a movie theatre next to the Publix. Dinners were down on Duval. They also have a fitness center which was more than adequate. They have at least 5 cardio machines and a free weight stand with a bench. They also offer washer and dryers for the cost of $2.00 a load which was huge as we didn't have to check any bags in at the airport and pay those hefty bag fees. We each had a carry on and did our laundry the day before we flew out. Our ride from the hotel to airport was about 1.5 miles from the hotel and the cab ride was $6.50 p.p.

However, after settling in this didn't matter, the pool and bar area was so beautiful that we had no reason to stay in the room for any length of time. It was a fantastic place to chill out and the adjoining cafe/eatery was convenient along with the friendly bar staff. The location of the hotel was not ideal though as it felt it was plonked in the middle of nowhere, nothing much around for tourists apart from a few malls containing the regular chain stores and supermarkets. We knew nothing about the geography of Key West before we went and it was only by the knowledge of a friendly local whilst on the bus that we found out about Mallory Square and Duval St; after this we spend every night getting the bus to Duval St as that's where everything is, in the night anyway. In spite of this, the bus was very cheap and as long as you pick up a timetable you can plan nights out easily, I will add that the buses finish rather earlier than any party-goers may like. Beaches are mainly on the south west side of the island and were great, we had use of the sunbeds, shade, kayaks and pedalos included. This made for a great day at the beach. Overall I would have to thorougly recommend this hotel as it was such a stunning place to stay, the pool area was fantastic and although I have commented on the location it really did not spoil our trip in the slightest as the island is so compact and easy to travel it wasn't much of an issue, I just feel that I should mention it. The rooms were comfortable and cleaned regularly. A great place to stay!

The place is awesome. It doesn't matter if it's not in the middle of the hustle and Bustle of Duval, Its driving distance from Duval and Mallory Square, but it's worth it. We planned on taking a cab but we decided against it. We got our car and went and we found a parking lot close to The Key West Winery that only charged us $15.00 for the entire day until 4 am. We enjoyed the pool every day. the pool was clean so was the Jacuzzi. The ambient was quiet and very family oriented. It was funny while I was in the pool, I see my daughter running over to the bar by the pool and when I go see why, she says \"look Mommy, they are putting Shrek!\" I liked that. They realized there were lots of children in the area and put in a movie. The rooms are spectacular. Marble bathrooms, plasma tv's, DVD, refrigerators, very clean. the staff was amazing. The only complain I have is that our refrigerator was broken and we called twice to have them fix it, but no one came. I didn't worry too much about it since I had nothing that needed refrigeration, otherwise I would have really complained and would have had the problem solved. Overall, I loved it and loved the fact that the pool is open until very late. So when we arrived from a long day of walking, we just changed into our swimsuits and ran to the pool.

When we went through some different websites to find a nice place to stay in town, we stumbled across the Inn at Key West. While not a big name resort, they satisfied us very nicely. We aren't a huge snorkling/boating/fishing group, mainly we wanted to stay somewhere away from home that we could sit at a pool and worry about nothing. This was the perfect place for it. When people complain about how \"far\" it is from downtown, one needs to realize that from tip to tip, Key West is about 5 miles long and 5 miles wide. It's a 10 minute drive to Duval St., and we found a parking spot at Mallory Square in 5 minutes...though parking is retarded expensive. You are within a 10 minute drive of everything in Key West...Ft. Zachary Taylor, the southernmost point, Duval St....it's all right around the corner. The concierge was helpful in telling us the best beach to go...though if you are going for beaches, you're going to the wrong place. The beaches in the Keys are notoriously rocky and meant for sitting, not surfing. She also recommended a nice pasta place and had a coupon to go along with it. The pool was great. Nice and large with a ton of seats, as well as the Tiki Bar (not really a Tiki bar...you need a thatch hut for that). Decent prices on booze and food for a hotel, too...plus a happy hour that offers $1 off from 4-7. It really is a tropical pool...tons of palm trees, a sand \"beach\" by the spa. Very, very nice. My only gripe is the bed was a little stiff for me, but I have a bad back anyway. So take that with a grain of salt. The room was nice, the fridge was a bonus and the TV was big enough to keep the kids engrossed from their bed across the room.

It's always hard to understand the proximity of your hotel to where the \"action\" is in the area you are traveling, until you get there. The Inn at Key West is a few miles to Duvall Street, which is the only fun/touristy area in Key West. It is by no means walking distance and parking can run you $10 for all day or $4 per hour, depending on which of the VERY FEW parking lots are available in the Duvall Street area. The hotel PROS: Lovely lobby with delish water with lime, lemon and orange slices all day. Comfortable bed Fridge and coffee maker Nice pool - although it's never refreshing as you will see all the pools are heated by the sun VERY FAST! Like bath water. Tiki bar next to pool IHOP next door Publix grocery store and KMart just down the street James at the front desk... great guy Hotel CONS: The air conditioner is SUPER LOUD!!! The balcony is so small I have no idea how they got 2 chairs on it. Once the chairs on on it... there's no room for you. The pool towels are rarely available as there is no towel person You can only hear the music when you are near the speakers by the pool and they ONLY play raggae or Jimmy Buffet... which is fun but after 2-3 days... you want something else. The breakfast buffet is outsid eand it is honestly so hot there that it is difficult to eat at the buffet. Also, they had cream cheese that was not on ice or chilled, even though the package said \"needs refrigeration\" right on it. Did I mention it was blazing hot with un-refrigerated cream cheese? The concierge scheduled a sunset snorkle and a dinner at Lattitudes (a restaurant on Sunset Key) at the same time on the same day... which is physically impossible to do. So we were given the worst seat left at Lattitudes when we arrived. Lattitudes is a very expensive restaurant.. which is contrary to what the concierge told us. My husband and I spent $141 between the 2 of us. That included 1 appetizer, 1 coke, 1 martini and 1 entree each. No dessert. $141!! And she told us it wasn't very expensive all while messing up our reservation. We were not happy. When we returned to the hotel to tell them what had happened, the night gal working the front desk was sitting on the counter on the phone talking to a guest. She didn't make eye contact with us and was sitting there all slouched over, picking at her nails. I would have at least stood up when I knew a guest could see me and make eye contact. At the very least. When we told her what happened she said \"Ohhhh, geesh. Sorry.\" Yup... glad to see she wanted a manager to know. Not. We told James the next day who immediatly told the concierge who then denied any responsibility. Of course. Overall... I would have stayed at a different hotel. I would have stayed at the Southermnost Hotel or Westin. Without a doubt. By the way... the adverstisement \"the largest pool in Key West\"... make sure you understand that it very well may be the largest in Key West but it is by no means large. Or refreshing.

The Pool - a really big plus point here in terms of it's size, the shelter that the palm trees offer from the intensity of the mid day sun, and the fairly efficient service from the pool side bar. The Rooms - very clean and comfortable, although a tad 'traditional' for our tastes. Local amenities - if you didn't fancy trekking down into town, there are a few other hotels, bars, shops, ATM's etc all right next to the hotel. Views - apart from the main road at the front of the hotel, which can be busy during during the day, the sunset views were 1st class. Food - Not bad at all, typical US size portions, so you never went hungry! Negatives: The surly staff - from our immediate arrival through to our departure, the typical US good nature was seriously lacking. Pool toys - personally I want to be able to swim in a pool, not have to dodge around lots of people floating on it. Poolside music - I love Bob Marley most of the time, but seriously I don't want to listen to his music or tacky Calypso 24/7! Lack of lifts (elevators for my US friends!) - if you've been travelling for 5+ hours to get somewhere, it'd be nice if you could use a lift to get to your heavy suitcases up to your 2nd floor room, or at least have your bags delivered for you. Room - small balcony which was fairly unusable due to hot air being blown out from AC unit. AC unit was also way to loud in the room just when you needed it most. Overall, this hotel was ideal for our 5 days on Key West but any longer and I think the negatives would become irksome. Having throughly researched other options, I think that the Inn at Key West is probably the best value for the rate you pay. If you want better, you will have to pay a lot more!", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cgreat deal , great pool area\u201d", "Author": "BruceHToronto", "ReviewID": "UR66378814", "Content": "Grabbed the deal with Expedia and it was worth every penny.

We felt a little uneasy being on the first floor of a hotel where someone could easily walk up to and break into our room so we asked to be switched to a 2nd floor room. We were switched quickly and without issue but the internet in the 2nd room didn't work so we they switched us to a room facing the pool that had \"miraculously\" just opened up (yeah right). Rooms seemed clean enough until I went to the bathroom of our last room which had the remnants of a jumbo roach squashed on the wall next to the shower. I guess the prior guest had killed it and housekeeping didn't think that was their job to get what was left of it off the wall. I also had the pleasure of killing about six baby roaches in the bathroom area during my stay in the first day alone. I was only staying for 2 nights and it was a non-refundable rooom so I just zipped up all my bags before going to sleep and shook out all bags that couldn't completely close before leaving the hotel for good. Good looking hotel with good service but the roach issue would make me hesitate to stay again. I guess I should be thankful I didn't see a bunch of roaches scatter in the morning like a guest did at the Wicket Guesthouse which we were also considering for our stay. It's pretty far away from the action. We're New Yorkers so a little bit of a walk doesn't scare us so when we saw one reviewer say that it was a 30 minute walk to the center of town we were hopeful of doing just that but it's just too damn hot to walk that far.

We made reservations about a week out as this was kind of a spontaneous trip. We werent informed at time of reservation that the biggest part of the hotel was being renovated. Not a huge deal but this ate up the majority of the rooms that view the water on the opposite side of the pool. We were given what they called an upgrade due to the inconvienence but I suspect they just gave us whatever they had open because it wasnt anything special. The room we ended up with wasnt bad at all. It was very clean and although we had originally wanted one king we got two queens. I know this sounds like a terrible experience so far but while it was an inconvienence a bit everyone was very friendly while handling it and I think they were just a bit handcuffed by what they could offer due to the renovations and lack of available rooms. Maybe I am just a bit more understanding than most. Anyway, the room was very clean and the beds were comfortable and clean as well. We didnt spend much time in the room as Duval was just too inviting. The pool here is spectacular. Great, large pool, with awesome thick and comfortable floats that even hold your drink. The pool redeemed everything else about this place for us. They even have a hot tub back in the cut that is kind of hidden behind some palms and down a sand path. It was nice to be able to escape back here and enjoy some drinks in the evening. For the price we paid to stay here I would say that the value was pretty good compared to other places in the area. I think we did end up getting a discount due to the problems we had which made it even better. We both slept great in the beds. Whether it was due to the beds or the drinks Im not sure but regardless. The lady at the pool bar was a local who had lived in the area for quite some time and had some great \"off the beaten path\" suggestions. They also had a tv at the pool bar so we could keep an eye on the football scores. I enjoyed the location of the place. It was close enough to Duval to not be a bad drive or taxi ride and far enough away to not be overwhelmed by the cruise people. Also if you are staying here for an extended amount of time there is a Publix and a few other shopping options in the plaza next door about 100 yards away. All in all we had a good time here and would love to give it another shot under full opertaing circumstances. I would reccommend it to anyone with kids because the pool is so good.

We decided to save a few bucks by flying into Miami and driving down to Key West. After arriving in Miami, we drove to Key Largo(about an hour ride) and spent the night at the Holiday Inn to break up the travel time. (We later realized that the drive to Key West wasn't as bad as we expected and would recommend to knock out the drive in one day.) While in Key Largo we stopped at the local liquor store to stock up on liquor.. and to Kmart to get a cheap cooler, beach chairs and plastic cups (we knew drinks in Key West would be pricey and chair rental at Smather's beach was $10/day). While in Key Largo we ate at The Fish House for our first round of Mahi-Mahi (very tasty but overloaded with salsa). Early the next day we checked out and headed to Key West. The 2 hour drive seemed much shorter than it was- before we knew it we were in Key West! The Inn at Key West looks exactly how pictures on TripAdvisor show it-except the poolside view room didn't have much a view. Here is my breakdown of the hotel and Key West in general... Rooms- I'm not sure what the options are for this hotel but we paid for a King Suite Poolside. Our first room was 222. The room itself was a decent size, modern looking with a king bed w/ a down comforter and feather pillows. The bathroom's counter had minimal space but that's nothing to really complain about. The room had a nice flat screen tv on the wall. The balcony, however, was very disappointing. It was a very small balcony that barely fit 2 chairs on it-one of which was in front of the air conditioner so it blasted 100degree heat on you (however, we did see rooms that had larger balconies, so I'm not sure what kind of rooms they were). While our \"poolside\" room was on the same side as the pool, it overlooked foliage-no pool. The next day we requested a new room, and with no problem, we switched to room 213. This room had the view we were looking for! (although we had the same problem w/ the balcony). From what we saw- many of the \"oceanview\" rooms had the same type of foliage blocking the balcony so I'm not sure which balconies actually had a view of the water (keep in mind-the oceanview rooms are also facing the parking lot and a busy street). While the water is across the street, it is not a beach, so don't get too excited... Pool- The pool wasn't as big as we expected, but it was still gorgeous. The maintainence crew was out every day either testing the water, cleaning the rocks, or doing other things to keep this area up to par. There were always lounge chairs available, however, there were chair hogs that placed towels on beach chairs for large parties who never seemed to be there. Regardless-whether you wanted sun or shade, you had a place to sit! The hotel offered \"poolside service\" but we really didn't notice much of this going on (then again, we didn't splurge on the $8 poolside drinks). We did eat at the pool cafe and it was great! I had a bacon burger and my husband had a chicken sandwich that he raved about! mmmm! The downside to the poolside cafe was that it was only open until 3pm. Restaurant- One day we were up early and had breakfast at The Inn. Continental breakfast was $9.99 and Continental with eggs was around $13.99. Overall the meal was fresh and tasty (but expensive). IHOP is located next door-however we didn't really like it there. Staff- We found the staff to be helpful and friendly, even when we requested a room change. Beaches- We have traveled to the Bahamas, Barbados, Antigua and Jamaica and were expecting the beaches in Key West to compare.. they don't. If you are looking to book a \"beachy\" trip, Key West is not for you. Smather's beach made it on Florida's top 10 beaches as #3, but we were not impressed. It's only about 1/2 mile long and has lots of seaweed and cloudy water. We also visited Higg's Beach and found it to be the same- not the crystal clear blue water you'd expect. We spent most of our days at the pool. Smather's did have chair rentals for $10/day and various water sports available. Duval Street- If you like to party, book the hotel closer to Duval Street! Duval Street is filled with action, bars, shops and restaurants. We went down to Duval for lunch- dress casual- it's hot! .. and there are lots of beach goers nearby so everyone is pretty much in beach attire. Nightlife duval is very packed! Lots of drunk people (which was a little annoying for us). We didn't make it to any bars, but we walked down there on a couple nights and it was definitely an experience. There's a couple \"couple friendly\" strip clubs and a couple drag shows along the way. Garden of Eden is also on Duval- a clothing optional bar. Dry Tortugas/Fort Jefferson Sunny Days boat tour- we made reservations online and paid the day of the trip ($300 for 2). It was a great tour. It was a 2 hour ride to Fort Jefferson, lunch onboard (sandwiches, potato salad, etc) a tour of the fort and snorkeling (snorkel on the backside of the fort, there weren't many fish in other places- but be careful! We saw 3 baracudas swimming while we were out of the water!) Bring lots of sunblock- we wore SPF 30 (after getting a base tan of 3 days) and still got sun burn! Restaurants- We checked out a couple places while in Key West. We spent about $1300 in food for the week (and that's not eating 3 meals a day, or overdoing it on alcohol) 915 on Duval street was a decent restaurant if you like seafood. It's not good for red meat. I had the special- halibut over clams with roasted potatoes and veggies which was very tasty, but my husband ordered filet mignon. It was served with french fries. After 1 bottle of the cheapest wine we spent over $140. My husband was not happy about eating fries w/ his $100-something dinner. Hog's breath Saloon- we checked out Hog's Breath for lunch. We both had chicken sandwiches w/ fries and 1 drink each- it came to about $50. They had a band playing and the bar was pretty packed. I guess it's good for the experience, but the food wasn't anything to brag about. The Commadore Restaurant- Now this is a restaurant! It's located near Mallory Square right on the harbor. We both had filet mignon (with baked potatoes and veggies), side salad, and a side of asparagus and mushrooms. The bill was high (nearly $200 after a bottle of wine) but it was well worth it! We visited the restaurant at 830p, so the crowds were gone and we had excellent service. We had a great time in Key West, but probably wouldn't go back.. For the same price we could have went to an all-inclusive resort on an island with the white sand and crystal clear water we're used to.", "Date": "May 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Palm Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "Mhicks_10", "ReviewID": "UR64920220", "Content": "We came down to Key West to get married on the beach and stayed at the Inn.

My husband and I decided to take a nice long vacation to get away from it all and reconnect with each other. After many places we could have gone, we decided on Key West because of the beauty, history and just overall fun of it! I did alot of research on this website to see which place was for us. We have been together for 12 years and really wanted to be able to hang out by ourselves if we wanted to and a bed and breakfast was just not for us, but I didn't want to get stuck in a hotel for 9 days if I hated it too! After much deliberation and research (I use this term to its FULL capacity lol), we decided we wanted to stay here. The kid in me couldn't wait to dive in that pool and face it, the plants, palm trees and having the Gulf of Mexico just across the street just makes it an oasis! To my surprise, when I went to book the room - it was actually about $50 cheaper PER night! I was thrilled - we had an extra $500.00 to spend when we went on vacation (that we really needed lol) I do have to mention that once you make your reservation, they DO NOT charge it! That really threw me off when we went to check out and they needed our money! The room itself was beautiful - we got two double beds, huge flat screen tv, desk and chair, dresser with DVD player, refridgerator, coffee machine, hair dryer, safe, iron and the bathroom had a tub/shower combination. Two towels apiece (bath, hand and washcloth) and even though they have a sign for participating in the water reserving program, they changed our towels every day and cleaned our room spotless around noon or 1pm. The bed covers were great - nice clean white sheet, feather comforter(!), and a sheet over the comforter. I know this is weird information, but I've never been to a hotel that had such comfortable sheets and comforters! It wasn't like a hotel bed at all - more like my bed at home! We loved it - big pillows ranging from soft to firm and since we had two beds, we had tons of pillows! We had a nice A/C unit that kept our room super comfy - but it was a little loud. Honestly nothing I would complain about though - every AC makes a little noise and I found it relaxing when we would drift to sleep. The outside is just a beautiful place to be! Around all the rooms and the pool, there is just this quaint cobblestone paths that you can see a few lizards hop about here and there - not to mention the lush greenery! If you are big on plants and greenery, this is your hotel! It's not only surrounding the pool, but the cafe and the parking lot too! I loved that aspect about the parking the most. It really was nice and secure - made you feel like you were very safe and in a tropical paradise! The pool is as amazing as it looks - actually way better. It is heated, has a waterfall, steps, free pool floats - geez, we spent about every day (and night!) in the pool! The best part was it never seemed to close either - no matter what time we wanted to swim, it was always open if someone was out and about! The jacuzzi was nice and warm too - back behind the greenery, like another world! Nice tiki bar and the bartenders were very nice and really told you about Key West and what to do while you were there. The blended drinks were great (and strong!) and the best part for me was they let me watch my Cubbies play on the big screens they had in the tiki bar. (they have four total!) Happy hour was always a hit and can you believe they have pool side service! Yep, that's right - pull up your lay out chair and Mike will come and take your order! We didn't do much but drink - so I can't compliment on the food, but I did look and see that the portions were HUGE for the $$$ By the way, the fitness room really is great and I really wanted to go there every day, but from all the walking and swimming - I never did get to work out! We stepped in to see it - really a nice place if you can stick to your exercise regimen! I also wanted to fill you in on having the Gulf across the street. It is beautiful to look at, but please note - there is NO BEACH, only pavement to walk up and down (which is a great morning/evening walk!) if you can get across US1. This highway is really busy, so if you don't like road noise, request to be by the pool. (PS - awesome beach just down the street - about 3 minute drive) You know I did see alot of posts about how \"far\" this hotel was away from Duval. Seriously, after the second night of partying on that street I was ready for a vacation away from my vacation! This hotel is far away from town, but not so far that you can't get there - the whole island is only 2 miles by 4 miles lol And it is kinda nice to get away from all the hustle and bustle (not to mention the drunks and music!) We rented a car when we landed in Ft Lauderdale and drove through the entire Keys - something I would recommend if you don't mind driving and taking in the sites. By doing this, we had the car the whole time and the drive for us (from the hotel) was about 5 minutes away from Old Town. There is also a bus that runs daily and the cost is super cheap (like $2)! If you have any questions, or you want to do stuff while you're there in Key West, just ask the concierge! Yep, they have one that just sits there all day telling you what you can do and how much it costs! I loved this part of the experience because Millie really knew what was fun to do and we got discounts from the hotel! The staff was very accomidating and really worked hard. All the people I had direct contact with were always nice and had a smile on their faces. They did have to work on the parking lot while we were there, so we were asked to move our car to another lot. Not a big deal at all in my opinion - we had to walk maybe 10 more steps! I have tons of pictures because I really wanted to let you know the awesome experience I had here, so maybe if you are looking for a hotel you will give the Inn a try! We stayed in room 133 poolside which was on the bottom floor, so we neither had a balcony or a porch like some of the other rooms, but our room was a stone's throw from the pool and that is something I loved waking up to every morning! We had internet access in the room, but didn't bring our laptop. We would go into the lobby and do our emails there nightly. I'm not sure if it was just our room, but our phones had a hard time. I could rarely make a phone call from my cell phone in our room and I have AT&T as a provider. If you just feel like pizza or some fast food - this hotel is very close to that as well - not to mention a movie theater and bank right next door. This was the best hotel for our vacation - truly a vacation I will remember because of staying here! Here are some other things I think that are worth mentioning (to me anyway!) - They have washer and dryers so if you are there for awhile you can wash your clothes - The pop machines are expensive $2 per bottle. Better off going next door to gas station - The cafe is only open til 3pm or so - The bathrooms are really updated and clean! - There are lizards playing about, but nothing to get riled up over. I literally only saw maybe 5 of them the whole time I was there (9 nights) and most of the time we saw them when we were in the parking lot. - The hotel has a little room with candy bars, soda, sandwiches, medicine, hats, etc. I didn't see this until our last day and believe me - I would have loved to know that when I wanted that candy bar the second night lol - There is always someone at the front desk - even super late! - There is a fresh water shower and roomy bathroom right next to the pool I 100% recommend this hotel and can't wait to go back again!", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anchorage, Alaska", "Title": "\u201cnice pool\u201d", "Author": "putchka63", "ReviewID": "UR62963320", "Content": "Beautiful hotel.

I checked and read everything I could find on their website to make sure I was doing the best thing for my family. Finally, in January I booked an early bird type deal and saved a few bucks. About a week before we were to arrive I got an email from the hotel asking if I would like to upgrade to the \"Generous King\" for an additional $30 a night which I agreed to. I am brilliant!! What a beautiful, huge hotel room. The furnishings were exquisite and service we received from the staff and service people was more than anything I could ask for.

My only complaint is the darn chickens!!! Though no fault of the hotel's, these freaking free range chickens of Key West woke me up every day at 4AM! I am an insomniac and don't always fall asleep that easily so I was often aggravated by their rowdiness. Thank goodness for the sun-proof curtains that gave me a couple extra hours of shut-eye after the chickens decided to shut up lol. One complaint though. Our room was situated directly beside the supply room where the staff meet every morning. They were VERY loud and had full conversations, waking me up and ensuring that I didn't fall back asleep.

We had a room on first floor with a patio towards the pool and it was very nice. If what you see out the window is no big deal then book the regular rooms which may look into the parking lot. The beds were really comfortable and the room was clean. I never heard noise in the hallway or from the neighbors through the walls. Yes, I did see a couple ants by the bathroom sink, but in that warm climate it was not a shock. Guess what, I get them in my house sometimes too! The pool area is wonderful and they also offer drink service from your lounge chair. There were a few \"spring breakers\" around the pool and they were actually pretty tame. Maybe they were recooperating from the night before? Anyway, the food from the bar service was decent and the drinks were made by friendly bartenders. You are a ways from Duval Street, but we knew that when we booked. It is about a fifteen to twenty dollar taxi ride one way including tip.

Replenishment of supplies and towels was inconsistent. (No bath mat one day, bath soap not replenished when down to a sliver, one waste basket emptied, but another, with an orange peel and other garbage, left untouched. The carafe for the in-room coffee maker was missing when we arrived; maintainence only brought a replacement after three calls to the front desk. No spare toilet roll supplied. Ice bucket not cleaned.) -While our room (234) was an attractive blend of modern with period touches, to some extent form won out over function. (In the attractive closet unit, which provides good shelf space, the hanging rod is too low to accommodate slacks on a pants hanger. The room had a clean, modern look in part maintained by concealing the coffee maker and small refrigerator inside cabinetry; unfortunately this makes the coffee maker difficult to use, and the unvented cabinet causes the refrigerator run hot. Notes left to housekeepers requesting the refrigerator cabinet door be left open were ignored . The attractive coffee table in front of the sofa has an upholstered surface, making it useless for coffee or drinks. The bathroom has a clean, modern look, with attractive marble tiled floor and tub surround, but no hand rails in the tub/shower. The bathroom is lit with one bulb; when the bulb fails, the room will be pitch-black. Light fixtures are attractive, but lighting is uneven, with little illumination over the refrigerator and coffee-maker.) -No index to guest services or operating instructions are provided. -This two-story facility has no elevators. -Because the property is not associated with a chain, there are few discounts from the rack rate available, and no \"points\" are earned for future stays or upgrades; these can be significant at chain-affilated properties. -Limited meal service and no room service. -At this level most properties (Hampton Inn, Holiday Inn Express, Hilton Garden Inn,) today include all-day lobby coffee service and in-room microwaves; The Inn has neither. This property has some pluses that should be mentioned. +Towels and linens are equal to, if not better than, a well-run mid-range motor hotel. +The room contains a very large, good-quality wall-mounted flat-screen TV, well-placed for watching from bed or sofa. +The bed and mattress are very comfortable. +Our room was very quiet; despite the pool and traffic outside, little or no noise penetrated. +Unlike several near-by establishments, parking is free. (One nearby property charges $17/day for parking!) +The free broadband internet, wired in-room, wireless in pool and lobby areas, was fast and worked consistently well.

The only complaints are that we couldn't work out how to open the safe, and the front desk didn't answer the first time I called. Then I forgot about it, since we found another way to secure our valuables. And the knob on the front door that the latch goes over was broken, again not a big deal. The roosters also woke us up at 4am each morning, but that's an issue for the whole island, not just the hotel. The location is quite a way from Duval St, but still close enough that we were able to ride our bicycles everywhere we wanted to go.

First off I dont know how anyone can complain about this place, dont believe the negative comments. We rented a car in Miami and drove down, it took about 3 1/2 hrs or so, it was a nice ride and beautiful scenery. The towns along the way were quaint and some a little backwoods, but still it was nice. We checked in and stayed in rm 119, it was clean and had nice furniture, the design was very nice and classic tropical. The bath room was beautiful and the shower was very nice with huge rainshower head. The service was great, they have free internet so you have to wait sometimes from other guests \"hogging it\", that is really my only complaint and that isnt the hotels fault. There is an Ihop next door , it is not a nice Ihop, it was a little in need of a new ceiling, but the prices are good. We ate next door to the hotel at the breakfast buffet and that was nice. It is kind of hidden in the back by the hotel. My husband decided to go fishing so I went along, early in the morning. He went through Local Peter Haydon, he was very nice and for $350 for half day, it was totally worth it for my husband, he caught alot of Tarpon and had the fight of his life and I had it all on video and the fish was spalshing and jumping and my husband was reeling it in and laughing, and then got the fish in. I set the video camera down for a second to take a picture of my husband and the fish he caught and the boat tipped to the side and when it did, the video camera slid off and into the ocean never to be seen again. I was so upset and mad all at the same time, but my husband handled it well and felt so bad for me. Even with that happening we had the best time and totally recommend him, so look him up he will show you real fishing. All in all we liked this hotel alot and have no complaints. The hotel is about 7 minutes away from like Duval street and downtown, but there is parking. We found parking downtown by the Truman Annex by Caroline street the best and one block from Duval st, the cost is $1.50 for an hour they dont take cash so have quarters ready.

We chose this hotel based on research online and were happy with our choice. The hotel is about 15 minutes away from Old Town and Duval street. If you are going to Key West for the action, this hotel is not for you as you will need to drive or take a cab to downtown as the hotel does not offer a free shuttle (Which they should for their guests). The grounds of the hotel are well maintained. The pool and surrounding landscape are very nice. The pool is very large and there is a hot tub as well. There is a cafe and tiki bar for food and drinks by the pool area. Grocery and liquor stores are in walking distance; if you have a fridge in your room...go there for some supplies. We stayed in a superior room with a king size bed and balcony. The room was very nice, with a view of the pool from our balcony. The pictures on their website were accurate. The only negative about the room was on a few occasions housekeeping did not get to it until after 4pm, but they likely had many check outs on those days. Vanessa at the front desk was very helpful. Millie at the conceirge desk was friendly, helpful and full of knowledge about the island. Bozena in the cafe was a wonderful waitress. I think the people that complained about this hotel, would complain no matter where they were staying. If this is your first time to Key West, take the Conch Train tour. It is well worth the $29 per person and they provide a shuttle to Mallory Square and back to the Welcome Center by the Holiday Inn which is right down the street from The Inn at Key West. You can take the tour and shop Duval street then take the shuttle back. If you go to Higgs Beach be sure to see Fran for a chair or kayak rental. He is extremely friendly and helpful. Don't miss the sunset celebration in Mallory Square! Bring small bills to tip the street performers! Take a cab from the hotel...it is worth the money.

For those of you who have never been, let me tell you this: The Inn at Key West is just too far away from downtown Key West to be worth the money. That is not to say that the hotel is awful--in fact, this hotel is quite nice and has a beautiful pool. However, as they say in real estate: location, location, location. Unfortunately, this is not something The Inn at Key West has working for it. We ended up driving into town each day (approximately 15 minutes to get into town) and paying $10 for parking. The problem with this is that we wanted to be able to go back to the hotel and swim or shower or whatever....this was NOT convenient because of the hotel's location. You could walk or bike to downtown but that's taking more time out of your precious vacation. We met a couple who walked downtown (45 minute walk) and ended up taking a cab back because they couldn't imagine having to walk that distance again. My suggestion is to book a hotel closer to Duval street so that you can truly experience the Key West spirit. The front desk staff was awful, particularly Vanessa. On three separate occassions (even after I was fully checked in), she told me that she could not find me in the system nor any of my reservation information. She could not remember even having spoken to me previously that same day (an hour earlier!). The pool-side cafe only serves food during specific hours which was not convenient to our schedule. One perk is that the bar and pool stays open until 10:00 pm. The pool is beautiful and large. The hot tub was hot but the jets were not working on either of the nights we were there. There are no beaches within walking distance to this hotel. The rooms were nice. Our king-sized bed was very comfortable and our room was quite clean. The hotel provided quality shampoo/conditioner samples (Bath and Body Works) which was a nice perk. In essence, I would recommend this hotel if you are staying in Key West only for the weather and for relaxation. If you want to be in the action or if this is your first visit, I would go elsewhere. You can get another hotel closer to the action for a similar price (although the pool will probably not be as large).", "Date": "April 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "julymalta", "ReviewID": "UR27415508", "Content": "I was on vacation with three more friends in the USA, we did a road trip though Florida and booked this hotel through the internet, just reading the advices from people who had stayed there.

The hotel is located quite a way out of the main centre of Key West. Rather than being close to Mallory Square and Duval Street, it's along a main road with some other hotels, fast food restaurants and strip malls. It is right next to the sea (no beach) but, like the rest of Key West, they don't make the most of it. The hotel has parking but you'd need to drive/get a taxi to the Mallory Square area and pay to park there. Reception is large and quite impressive. There's no lift so you have to carry your cases upstairs. Check in was efficient enough but we weren't made to feel at all welcome. The room was pleasant, with two double beds. We had a little balcony (just enough room for two chairs) which looked out over the main road to the sea. The room had a fridge which we stocked with drinks etc from the nearby Publix supermarket. (Go here to change travellers cheques, the bank won't do it unless you have an account). Wifi was available in the hotel but didn't work in our room. It also only seemed to work with windows so was no good for our mobile phones. There were two PCs near reception which you could use. The pool area was attractive and had plenty of sun loungers. You could borrow towels although they were a little thin. The pool was heated which was a pleasant surprise. There was an outdoor bar which served a good range of drinks (including some horrid American beer). They also offered food; I had a chicken sandwich which came with homemade coleslaw and was very tasty. If you want to go to the beach, I would recommend going to the Fort Zachary Taylor Historic Park in the west of the island.", "Date": "April 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cLovely Rooms, Great Staff, Nice Pool\u201d", "Author": "ice_harvester", "ReviewID": "UR27056091", "Content": "Spent three nights with a pool view.

It was not the free drinks as much as the principal of the thing. There is a I-HOP next door for breakfast or you can eat at the hotel for about 15 per head.

The pool was amazing, with plenty of sun loungers. The pool could possibly do with a few less palm tree's as there were not many spots which were in the sun all day. The only draw back is the distance to old town (where all the bars are). We walked it a couple of times and it takes about an hour. We also tried the local bus service, but waited over half hour! It was also easy enough to get a taxi, but it costs about $15 each way. Although the plus side of the location is that it is relatively quiet and you get a lot more for your money then you would in Old Town.

Definitely the nicest hotel pool on the island, which was clean, and not overcrowded. A full service tiki bar, with a server who will refresh your drinks while you relax, and charge them to your room. The cafe has the BEST cheeseburgers, and waitstaff was sooo nice and friendly. But they don't serve dinner. Our room was larger than I anticipated, with a granite countertop sink and marble floors in the bathroom. And yes, the A/C worked just fine, despite everyone complaining about it. Not a noisy hotel at all. My only complaint might be about the coffee/ housekeeping. I even left them notes, with decent tips, requesting more regular coffee packets, and to skip on the decaf. They would bring us all decaf!! The soaps/shampoo are Bath & Body Works~ very nice. Some days they would give us 2 bathmats, and not enough towels. Weird. But the front desk was very accomadating about these tiny concerns. Oh, and you don't get a fridge in your room, unless you want to pay the extra fee. But hey, this is Key West. Go out and eat!! . It is on the far side of the island, away from the Duval Street madness, but if you are looking for the best of both worlds like us, this is it. The front desk had no problems calling us a Taxi, which was there within 5 minutes, every day. And it's a 10 minute ride to party central. They have a concierge who will arrange for Scooter delivery right to the hotel, which is honestly the best, and most fun way of getting around the island. But if you hang locally, there is an IHOP right next door, a small neighborhood bar who's always grilling food outside, a liquor store, and full size grocery store all within walking distance. Despite the signs prohibiting it, we even made drinks in our room, and carried them down to the pool, where no one bothered us about it. For me, it was my 2nd trip to Key West, and the better one. It was nice to have friendly hotel staff. (Last time I stayed at the defunct Atlantic Shores, where they seemed annoyed by our patronage) Unless, I can find a better deal, I'm staying here again, but probably opting for a refridgerator, and taking my own coffee.", "Date": "September 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "myrtle beach", "Title": "\u201cNot a Great Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "kna85", "ReviewID": "UR19603311", "Content": "My husband and I were married in Key Largo at the Marriott.

When we walked into our tiny room all I could think was that I had spent way too money on this place. In attempts to lift our spirits we made our way to the \"tiki bar\"...another disappointment. Neither the bartender that day nor a different bartender the next day were friendly. They unenthusiasticly threw together my mojito, which had old slimy brown mint, and served it to me as if nothing was wrong.

I'm glad I didn't let the negative feedback affect my decision to book this hotel. 30+ family members stayed here for my son's wedding. We stayed here 7 nights (7/15-7/22). Stayed in a Superior room, poolside with king bed and sofa bed (room 122). Room was very clean, spacious, flat panel TV, little patio (private, with fence around it) and GREAT bathroom, loved the shower!! EVERYONE had a fantastic time...the pool is magnificant. and is the largest in Key West. Tiki bar was great as were the bartenders. Never had breakfast, but had several very good lunches at the tiki bar. Never encountered any staff that were rude or unpleasant...they were very friendly. The pool was SPOTLESS and the pool and surrounding area were maintained very well (although the bathroom by the pool needed more often tending to....but with the number of \"dripping wet\" people going in and out I can see why the floor was always soaked). All of our guests had deluxe or superior rooms. Although a couple of guests had parking lot views, which was disappointing to one of my sisters, it wasn't a major issues as we were never in our rooms. We spent afternoons at the pool/tiki bar and had a blast!! Every one of us said we would definitely stay here again. A special \"thank you\" to Sandy Black, Tom the bellman (super nice man), and Esa at the front desk.....as well as the rest of the staff. I read reviews all the time and they can make your head spin with so many positive...then negative......but the choice to stay here regardless of any negative reviews was the right choice and I highly recommend this property.

It was barely a step above a Days Inn, and that is actually a compliment. The pictures are NOTHING like the hotel. We booked this hotel about a month before we went down there, based on the reviews. First of all, we did not know it was Lobster Fest until the day before we got there (our fault). When we booked the hotel, we had asked for 2 queens, as it was 4 of us. When we checked in, we were told we were only getting a king and a pull-out sofa. We had booked this way ahead of time! They said because we didn't book directly to the hotel, they could not accommodate our request. The hotel was full, so they could not swap our rooms (the receptionist was nice and pleasant and would've probably given us another room if they had one available). When I walked in the room (which we had paid more for the Deluxe room), it looked like my grandmother's bedroom. It was very small, the decor was cheap, undated, and the bathroom very small. It just wasn't what we paid for. I immediately called around other hotels, but there were none available. We were stuck. We called downstairs for pillows and blankets and all they had was 1 blanket. Our friends had to sleep on the sofa bed, sharing a pillow. We went down to the pool, hoping it would be as nice as the picture, and I was disappointed. Although the pool is nice (I give it that), it is much smaller than pictured and not nearly as beautiful and inviting as pictured. Please do yourselves a favor and stay somewhere else. Is not worth paying this much for an over-hyped place, unless of course you don't mind paying for platinum and getting silver instead.

The bathroom is ok but is obviously in need of an update as the tub had stains and the toilet had rust stains. Housekeeping didn't come during normal hours but stopped by at 5 in the evening and didn't wait for us to open the door but just barged in. They ended up never cleaning our room while we were there. The hotel ran out of towels (how I have no idea since the number of rooms in the hotel doesn't change). The front desk was not very helpful.

We had one of the recently renovated Superior Kings on the lower level. I should qualify, in case you have a phobia against lower levels, that the entrance to these first level rooms is only accessible from a Tommy Bahama decorated interior hallway that is nicer than any Hilton, Hyatt or Marriott that we have stayed in. The room also has a somewhat private and enclosed patio with a table and two chairs, weather permitting of course. As everyone else has already testified, the pool area, wonderfully landscaped grounds, hot tub, and Tiki Bar was/is the best that the island has to offer, certainly better than any of the others that we saw during the week we spent there, and we visited most of them. And a perk from having the island's largest pool with only 105 rooms, is that there is actually enough lounge chairs to accomodate everyone there. Imagine that!!! That's a first for us traveling in peak season. I personally did not consider the location of the Inn (being 3 miles away from downtown) an issue, as it was offset by the peace and quiet, free and easy parking, and convenient location to groceries, liquor stores, and restaurants. Besides, the elevation of Key West only varies by a couple of feet, so bike riding gets you anywhere you want to go without breaking much of a sweat.... well... you know....weather permitting. The Superior King room, though a tad small, was also decorated better than any Hilton, Hyatt or Marriott. In addition to all those Tommy Bahama caribbean fixtures, there were all those other little amenities such as big towels, a choice of two showerheads, a makeup mirror, a small refrigerator, a huge plasma wall mounted TV, and a pull out sofa bed. In short...the room is just decorated beautifully with all the extras. On the downside, Service and friendliness was just so- so, and maybe this is the one area that does not live up to some of the larger snob chains I mentioned. But you'll keep more cash in your wallet here. Bottom line...after 5 days at the Inn at Key West, and 3 days at the Fort Lauderdale Beach Hilton, it's not even close as to where I would return. But a word of caution folks....I understand the Superior Kings are significantly better than the other rooms, so ask for one of the renovated rooms.

The room we'd been moved to was the only one available & she could do nothing about that, but did compensate us. She was very polite & undersatnding and seemed shocked by her employee's behavior. The next morning we went to cafe for breakfast & staff were so rude that we left & checked out. Others around us were all complaining as well. The icing on the cake!! Or so I thought...now I get home to find my credit card has been charged double the amount of my receipt! It is a great location, easy to find, & the pool was nice. Until that last night, we were actually impressed with the place!! It only took the one guy at the front desk to ruin it for us. When the AC went out, had he been polite, apologetic & offered compensation us for the inconvenience of the move I would feel differently, which is what I told the mgr. Will I return??? That depends on how quickly and efficiently refund my credit card. It is in their control as to whether they have a customer pleased by the timely response to a problematic stay, or an unhappy customer due to lack of customer service. The jury is still out...", "Date": "July 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Deer Park, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Pool\u201d", "Author": "TexasBeachbum22", "ReviewID": "UR8084283", "Content": "Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Inn. The pool is AMAZING. Beautiful, relaxing cool. The poolside bar also has awesome pina coladas. We stayed in a deluxe room which was nicely furnished and clean. It was a little on the small side, but since we didn't spend too much time in the room it wasn't a problem. We had no problems parking the car and making the short drive to downtown. We had the breakfast buffett at the cafe every morning and it was fantastic, a great deal too.

The concierge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desk is located on the left underneath the staircase. And behind the concierge were two guest computer stations. Upon check-in, the front desk assigned us a Deluxe Room. After walking a long flight of stairs to get to the second floor (because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an elevator), we walked in and saw a room with less lavish d\u00c3\u00a9cor, more like outdated decor. I immediately realized that they had made a mistake. We then towed our heavy luggage back down to the front desk and asked to be switched to a Deluxe room as it is what I booked. The staff behind the counter denied that the room assigned was a Standard room and insisted that it was a Deluxe room. I challenged her by leading her to one of the computer stations, logged onto their website and pointed to her that a Deluxe room should look as such. She then returned to the front desk to check something and then reassigned us to one of the actual Deluxe rooms. To wrap up our conversation, she briefly said she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s providing the room to us at no cost because their website is misleading. The Deluxe rooms advertised online were of a different category, they belong in their Superior selection. Well, I am glad I was able to help clarify their room categories for them! We felt much more comfortable once we were in the Deluxe room, the amenities are different altogether including the flat-screen TV and their beautiful bathroom. The patio area was simple, there were 2 plastic chairs which we didn't use at all. The inn has a restaurant called the Inn Caf\u00c3\u00a9. They have pretty good food, we can't speak for dinner but lunch was pretty good. My husband had a delicious snapper salad and I had a burger, quick service and affordable prices. There's also an IHOP next door for breakfast, again, quick service and affordable. Their pool is really, really nice. It has a dramatic fountain in the middle and made it look spectacular. If you don't stay here, try to come in just to use the pool. There were float beds on the water and you could easily doze off into the afternoon. It was a relaxing experience. The inn is situated right off the exit to Key West on Northern Roosevelt Blvd so it is a little ways away from the downtown area.

Our room had a flat panel TV which was a nice feature. The staff was friendly & they allowed us to check in early. The hotel is not close to Duval st. so if your going to attempt to do the Duval crawl have a designated driver or take a taxi.

The pool was by far the best part of the hotel, it gorgeous, clean and there is a hot tub close by if you feel the need for a little spa action. The downside was that housekeeping took FOREVER to clean the rooms. The first morning they were knocking on the door at 8am, the other three days they didn't show up until closer to 3 or 4pm. There is a grocery store within walking distance, but no fridge in the room. Try Hemingway House, Peppers (they sell all kinds of hot sauces) and Kermit's Key Lime Shoppe...they were all well worth it!

Tiki bar poolside drinks are expensive but they are normally anyways no matter where you go it seems! The only negative I can think of is the bed sunk a bit in the middle (King size), so I felt like I would roll over and it took pretty much our whole stay (4 nights) to get used to it.

The pool area is a sun trap oasis the best pool in all of the five hotels we stayed in during the holiday. The breakfast ,which is not included , was good but I was a little annoyed the guy added a 20% tip for basically a self service breakfast.(in the UK we tip for good service not for saying good morning) Ideal location, park up the car (free) and catch the local bus to downtown.
