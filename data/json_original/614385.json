As a result, the atmosphere is very tranquil and restful. If you like it quiet with nothing much to do, then this is the place for you. As to facilities, there is a small charming salt-water pool (not good for children as it is quite deep) but that is about it. Food was reasonably priced and reasonable quality for a boutique spa hotel, and the chef was very accommodating to guests' tastes and preferences. In any case, as others have said, the hotel is quite willing to drive you to/from Ubud upon request where there are plenty of dining choices (but we never found any great ones).The pros are that staff are very friendly and helpful, and the environment is relaxing. The cons are that there is nothing to do at this place unless you want to take day tours. We wished there was a gym, more satellite tv stations, a well-stocked library with books and games, dvd player and a more private lounge area. The problem with the main lounge area is that all the staff congregate there and it is impossible to get any privacy (unless you opt for the villa option). There's a difference between friendly and obstrusive. Also, the staff are constantly asking you what your program is and trying to convince you to take this tour and that tour. Got to the point we just avoided the more vocal ones. The toilet also smelled horrible (I think it's the piping) and that permeated through our room. Overall, we enjoyed the experience but wished there was more to see and do.", "Date": "Jul 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR202364482", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "sazzbear"}, {"Content": "The real Bali I stayed in Bhanuswari's villa with a couple of friends for 3 nights and we had a wonderful time. The villa is lovely with a good size pool, and the location of the hotel is breath taking and idyllic, in the middle of the rice paddy fields. This is by no means 5 star luxury, but rather a real experience of Bali. We kicked off the trip with massages in an outdoor room that serves as a spa, and had dinner in the hotel on most nights because it's quite far from any restaurants in Ubud. The food is nothing to rave about, but the breakfast is very good. One thing to note is that if you stay near Ubud you will be very far from the beaches in the south, and the major attractions in the north. We had to drive an hour everytime we wanted to go somewhere. So if you're looking for a traditional place at a modest price and don't expect luxury, then Bhanuswari is the place for you.", "Date": "May 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR522810809", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "hd281"}, {"Content": "A True Local Experience. More Guesthouse Than Resort This modest and very affordable locally operated hotel is in the middle of working rice patties and make an effort to employ local villagers as a way of sustaining Bali village life. They are a little inexperienced when it comes to customer service, but are very focused on your needs. Accomodations are simple. It is more of a guesthouse than a resort. Breakfast on the terrace overlooks fields and the distant volcano. Local children paint on the floor of the lobby, a walk down the access road takes you through rice fields that have been tilled for centuries. Within walking distance is a village that specializes in wood working. The management will take you into Ubud and pick you up and also arrange trips to other villages with craft specialities. Due to terrorism, economic times have been tough for the locals as many Australians (their major source of tourist revenues) have cancelled trips. This makes the local residents, including the hotel management very anxious to add side trips and services. It can be a bit off putting ,but many businesses are struggling to survive.", "Date": "Dec 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR978864775", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "columbuscirclenyc"}, {"Content": "One of the best I have been to If you choose to have a few tranquil / peaceful holiday days on the outskirts of Ubud, nothing I saw (in or out of Ubud) compared to Bhanuswari. The room, views and service are second to none. I have travelled all over the world and am pleased to write to recommend this hotel. The owner and staff provide a wonderful shuttle to and from Ubud and local villages and a personalised tour service - no need to book through the many vendors - check the hotel service first. This service is built around your time not schedule times - wonderful!!

Its definately a lovely place to pause for a couple of nights and to be a home base for this part of Bali. We planned on being there for only 2 nights but enjoyed our stay so much we stayed an extra. The resort is small, maybe 10 rooms with a guest cottage and priced right. The staff was friendly, the food was excellent. Drinks and water are a bit expensive for my Bali taste so that would be my only compliant. You can by your own drinks next time at the market for massive late night consumption....The rooms are clean and comfortable. Being on our honeymoon, The staff set flowers for our arrival throughout or room and had a wonderful candle light dinner with flowers and candles floating in the pool. A wonderful personal touch that would cost you a pretty penny at any major resort. Very Nice!!! Everything was cater to every whim for us including a personal driver to take us to the volcanos, arts and tour the temples. After staying here we headed back to the coast for diving and surfing.My next trip to Bali will surely include another inland visit to see my friends at Bhanuswari Resort  Spa.", "Date": "Dec 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR455083877", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mesaloc"}, {"Content": "\u813f recommander       notre chambre au Bhanuswari", "Date": "Jan 3, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR785214267", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Balikecak"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d614385-r21915037-Bhanuswari_Resort_Spa-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "614385", "Price": "$79"}}
