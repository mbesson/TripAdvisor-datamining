(it was stained). the duvet cover, sheets and pillow cases etc and bathroom were very clean. the carpet seems old and i did find the room a bit smelly ( cigarettes?) when i first entered the room. however this soon disappeared once we were settled in and had air con on. the staff were very pleasant, polite and helpful. the hotel is in a good location for the metro and the mall and also there are supermarkets and plenty of restaurants in the immediate vicinity.i probably wouldnt stay here again (well not at \u00a3100 per night without breakfast) but would recommend if the hotel was offered or found at a discounted price.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geelong, Australia", "Title": "\u201cComfortable Stay in Dubai\u201d", "Author": "josh-aus", "ReviewID": "UR120521623", "Content": "I recently returned from a working trip to Dubai where I spent 7 nights at the Golden Tulip Al Barsha. Upon entry, the lobby and lobby lounge are very tidy and well presented. The staff behind the counter were friendly, spoke english well and I was in to my room in about 10 minutes. I stayed up on the 5th floor in a standard room, the 5th is a no smoking floor which was good (I advise this to be requested). The room was well presented. A king size bed, bed site table on either side, reading lamps and light switches for the whole room. There was a desk (with a large mirror behind it) and a chair. The desk has a glass top, so if you are using a computer like I was, take a mouse pad. There was a 32 inch TV mounted on the wall and below was a unit with a small fridge inside it and mini bar snacks and tea/coffee on top. There was also two reading chairs and a small coffee table to sit at. The bathroom was large enough, with a huge mirror, a fold out mirror from the wall, and a combo shower-bath. Beside the bed is a wardrobe with probably half a dozen coathangers and a safe. The room was cleaned everyday, the bed made and fresh towels etc. One night, I'm not sure why, but I also recieved a small plate of strange pastry cake things and some dates. The air conditioning worked perfectly, some times I was even too cold - especially in the lobby. The only complaints I have about the air conditioning, is that in the hallways on level 5 (Not sure about the other levels), but there was a smell I can only descripe as \"damp\", and it is a little noisy, but I slept fine. Another thing, there is a construction site next door, so if you are a light sleeper, the banging of work tools might keep you awake if you plan to sleep during the day. There are a few other hotel facillities too. There is a rooftop pool and gym, I checked it out but never swam, it looked nice, might get a little crowded in the hotter months. Only level 1 there is a sports bar with pool tables and tv's showing... sport. On level 1 there is also a Korean Restraunt, again I can't comment because I never ate there, and If i'm right, the restraunt is seperate to the hotel, so you can't book the meals to your room number, same goes for the night club down on the ground level. Im not so sure about the position of the nightclub, possibly suited better somewhere else, as when the door is open it fills the lobby and lounge with loud music, just seemed a bit tacky. And last, there is a restraunt on the bottom floor. This is the hotel restraunt and meals can be booked to your room, as well as everything can be ordered on room service. Because I was working over there, I didnt have a lot of time to get out and find a restraunt and quite often it was after midnight when I got back. The food was nice, the staff were friendly and the place is well presented and kept clean. As for the price, I will leave you to be the judge but you would be looking at meals at about 35 aed up to 80 aed for a seafood meal, and if I remember right, 25 aed for a heniken. Amongst food I had I had butter chicken, tikka roll, beef burger. No complaints. My advice would be to eat before midnight, as after midnight they go to their \"night\" menu, which consists of chicken/beef burger, fish and chips, and I cant remember the rest, but there's only 3 or 4 mains along with soups and deserts. There is also a buffet breakfast. Changed a little each day, hadfood like fresh fruit, toast, breads, baked beans, beef/chicken sausages, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, turkey bacon, baked potatoes, hash browns, ham, toasted sandwiches. It was nice but I will admit it was a bit bland after a week. The area the hotel is in is about a 30aed cab ride from the dubai mall, 40 aed to the dubai marina, almost walking distance to the mall of the emirates (just get a cab - they're so cheap), walking distance to a metro station. At the end of the street is a supermarket style store, with everything you'll need. There are also a couple of fast food outlets in the street, a couple of curry restraunts and also a couple of milk-bar style shops. Im led to believe (by taxi drivers) that there are two golden tulips in Al Barsha, so make sure you take note of the street name or take the little map that comes with your room key. I just started directing cabs to hotel \"Cassells\" because its at the end of the street and walking 100m. My only real complaint would have to be the price of the internet. It is wired and if I remember right, something like 400 aed for 7 days. All in all my stay was pleasing, I think the room was 360 aed a night which is reasonable. I would stay here again.

Overall, it was an ok experience but I wouldn't return. Firstly, the room I was allocated smelt so bad of stale cigarette smoke. I asked if I could be moved and one of the porters came back to the room, sprayed some air freshener around the room and then left. This didn't help so I just lived with it and kept my clothes in my bags at all times. The water came out of the shower brown at first which was quite worrying. It sounded like there was an air-conditioning unit right outside my window (on the 6th floor) which was really loud, all night. I reckon this would keep some people up. There is a very loud nightclub on the ground floor, just behind reception so I recommend you request a room as high up as possible. There is also a bar on the first floor but it's not as noisy, shows football and you can use the wifi in there for free (just ask the bar-staff). There was a lot of choice for breakfast although I wouldn't recommend the cooked buffet. As I experienced in another hotel at the start of the week, the alternatives for pork are (understandably) veal bacon and chicken or beef sausages. I found the bread and fruit are a better option. Although I have slated this hotel, the staff were all super friendly and the pool was a nice place to relax in. It's too small to swim lengths in but great to cool down in. The hotel is very conveniently next to a metro stop (Sharaf DG) and just one stop away from Mall of the Emirates, although I wouldn't bother using the train as you can walk there in about 10 minutes (unless it's scorching hot). If you can get this hotel for cheap then go for it. If it's for a week or so, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. It's definitely not a 4 star hotel.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cIt's NOT as good as before\u201d", "Author": "Iron_ManDubai", "ReviewID": "UR118638342", "Content": "Good location as it\u2019s nearby Mall of the Emirates.

The layout of the room was okay and the house keeping staff were cheerful and dutiful and kept the room homely at all times of my stay. The location of the hotel and the facilities are standard except that I did not feel the touch usually associated with a 4 Star hotel compared to the rate I pay per night. The worst part of it was that I could not watch CNN International throughout my stay in this hotel. I am not quite motivated to come back. The hotel is quite, the cheerfulness of the room cleaners, the value for money of the Telepizza shop and the dutifulness of the driver that took me to the airport (though I paid the hotel for his service) are some of the memories I may want to keep. However, the duty staff that checked me in and checked me out on this trip need to be client friendly (even if Iam still going to pay for a service that is supposed to be complimentary his approach and presentation should have being more warm). I asked for an internet service to checked for the status of my reservation he made me pay for one hour that I don't quite need; when I was waiting for the driver to take me to the airport he offered that I take coffee at the restaurant but then it was not complimentary, I paid...that is too bad.

It was a perfectly fine hotel and once they pave the roads and finish the Metro, it will be great.", "Date": "April 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spain", "Title": "\u201cNesting in Construction\u201d", "Author": "ElRonSandler", "ReviewID": "UR14332901", "Content": "I was recently in Dubai for the 08 Boat Show. In relation to the pricey hotels near the show the Tulip was a good option. It was over all a good stay and the quality of the rooms, service and food was over all very pleasant. But somehow on the internet they forgot to mention that the Tulip is the only finished building on the block. In other words all the other buildings are still under construction. There isn't even tarmac to the hotel. So as you can imagine...NOISYYY not to mention Dusty. But the location is great, beside the Emirates mall and Near the Burl al Arab and beaches...so Over all OK.", "Date": "March 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGood business hotel in Dubai\u201d", "Author": "WolfgangEmperger", "ReviewID": "UR11696834", "Content": "Good business hotel; small but decent restaurant for dinner/breakfast; nice sports bar and even a night club in the hotel.
