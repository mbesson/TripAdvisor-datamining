Although we would not necessarily classify it as a 4 star hotel, it was more than adequate for our needs. We got the hotel on a 40% discount so the price was right for sure. Because we were travelling with our teenage grandaughter, we asked for a triple rom and they gave us a decent sized room (by European standards) with enough space to move around and spread out our luggage. The beds were confortable enough although the matresses were a bit soft for our liking. The bathroom was large and had nice tiling and modern fixtures including a large jacuzzi tub. Unfortunately there was only a handheld shower which was a bit awkward to use. The hotel is quite eclectic and is decorated with an interesting mix of modern and traditional art. The breakfast was fairly average but there was enough variety to keep us happy. The location is not bad - right across the street from ruins of an ancient aqueduct and within 10 minutes walk to the Colosseum. The nearest metro station is about 5 minutes away. The neighbourhood has a number of small boutique style hotels but there is not much in the way of shops or restaurants until you get closer to the Colosseum. Try Tratoria Luzzi if you want a cheap and tasty meal but go early - it is packed with locals. The only negative comment we have is that our room was at the back of the hotel overlooking the courtyard which in the evening is a gathering place for hotel patrons wanting to party. This can get quite noisy at times. We were on the first floor. Rooms on higher levels might be quieter. The staff were reasonably helpful and friendly. When it was time for us to leave they made arrangements for a car and driver to take us to the airport which has much better than a regular taxi and the same price. Overall our experience with this hotel was positive and we would recommend it if you can get it at a discounted price.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNo way 4*\u201d", "Author": "naomiwLondon", "ReviewID": "UR127653949", "Content": "More 2/3* Stayed there 4 nights and my back knows it. To say the bed was hard is an understatement, luckily there was a small sofa bed in the room so I added that mattress which helped.

Jacuzzi bath which smelt bad when you put on the jets. Had a shower tap with connector on wall but it kept falling off - no shower curtain. Only shampoo and small soap provided. No robe etc provided. Not even any hotel information in the room. Room very noisy and hot - told no air conditioning available until summer but we were in a heat wave. Internet usage is free but kept cutting out in bedroom if available. No bar or restaurant, breakfast area. Breakfast boring, exactly the same each day and little choice - all self service. Coffee (IN ROME!!! instant). Eggs - overcooked scrambled and bacon all fat. Nice fruit salad. Staff were very nice and helpful with suggestions of where to eat and booked excursions for us. The tour of the Colosseum had dreadful guide and we lost 1/5 of the time as people arrived late at meeting point (from the coach collection) - did not even get to see the Palentine which is worth going to see so you have to pay again. Vatican had excellent guide. 10 mins walk from Metro. 20 mins walk from Colosseum. Take good shoes as you do a lot of walking on uneven ground. Rome has lovely sights but the streets are dirty, lots of dog mess and litter. Masses of graffiti and people rude. Not what we had imagined it to be.

The front desk person was great help in arranging our last minute tour experience for the Vatican and the Sistine Chapel. We also brought out our morning coffee and enjoyed the Rome weather sitting in the patio just outside of the front entrance. We were given two single beds put together as one which was a bit weird for newlyweds but we had the most relaxing and the sweetest sleep in Rome. The decoration was very colourful paintings on walls with marble flooring in the common areas.

There are historical monuments and good restaurants within a short walk. The downsides? The a/c and ventilation were non-existent. We either had fresh air with the windows open - but disturbed sleep from the noise of the scooters and cars on the cobbled streets, or the room was hot and stuffy (this was late October) and sleep was again disturbed. The room looked tired, with holes in the carpet, lots of scuff marks on the walls, and a lot of black marks near the non-functioning a/c duct.

Rooms appear to be aired out daily and air conditioning takes a great deal of time to bring the temp down so rooms never get really cold until early morning however prevailing winds, tile floors, marble and very high ceilings keep the rooms comfortable even without using the air ( at 28 C outside temp). No individual safes in room can leave valuables with front desk for safe keeping. Tons of TV channels but could not find any English ones needed to surf to find English shows with Italian subtitles (very limited).

On the negative side, the hotel rooms range from tolerably small to intolerably small. The room we had for the first night of our stay was far too small for two people. The room had too much furniture. The shower for this room did not work properly and sprayed water all over the bathroom. The air conditioner barely kept the room cool. Management gave us a much better room for the last three nights of our stay. Again, there were some maintenance issues--a missing drain plug for the bathroom sink, inadequate air conditioning, and a shower head that, unless directed carefully, sprayed water all over the bathroom. The missing drain plug should have been easy to fix but never got fixed. The air conditioner only had one operable fan speed and was barely able to keep the room cool (and we had fine, mild weather). This hotel is not a \"vacation wrecker.\" With some more attention to maintenance, this could become a very nice place to stay. My recommendation, if you want to stay in this hotel, is to check your room out first before you pay with your credit card.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDissappointing!\u201d", "Author": "saffas", "ReviewID": "UR111872798", "Content": "We took a risk and booked one of those \"special anonymous deals\".

It is a 10min walk from the Metro and the only main attraction that is within a 30 min walk is the Colosseum. The average breakfast is only served from 07.30am which we felt was too late as we were keen to get to the main attractions early to avoid the queues. So we either skipped it or grabbed something on our way out. Our room was tiny, considering how much we paid! The bedding and decor were old and tired and our aircon did not work properly. The walls are also very thin and with the room being near the elevator we constantly woke up to it opening and closing. The neighbourhood is not the best either. On our way back to the hotel from dinner one night my wife and I were stopped and searched by the police who were apparently looking for 2 drug dealers and suspected we may have bought drugs from them.

Friendly, Multi-lingual employees. 2. 2 Block walk from the subway - 15 walk to the Colosseum 3. Free Wi-Fi 4. Free breakfast from 7-10AM Now on to the review: During my trip to Europe this month I learned what makes a hotel great. There are only really three things, if you're a minimalist, that you will need. 1. Good bed 2. Quiet rooms 3. Working, Clean bathrooms. Sure, one could complain about the view from the window, the neighborhood dogs barking outside, or the interior design in a hotel, but all a minimalist needs is a good bed to sleep in, minimal auditory disturbances, and a working bathroom. I hear that many hotels in Europe consider a double-bed and 2 single beds pushed together as the same thing. The room we stayed in had 2 single beds pushed together. It wasn't a huge problem...It's common sense that if a big guy tries to lay next to his girlfriend on two single beds with wheels on a wood floor, the beds will move apart and he will find his shoulder and arm halfway through the gap. I understood this and the fact that it meant that my girlfriend and I couldn't cuddle. The problem with the beds was that they were lumpy, which is terrible for someone with a bad back, and loud. Every time I uselessly rolled over to get comfortable, the bed would make loud, cracking sounds. I don't know if it was the springs in the bed or if it was the frame but the sounds were so loud that it would wake us up from any sleep that we attempted. I say that we \"attempted\" to sleep because it was too loud in the hotel. I'm not sure how most 3 star hotels are in Europe but this one was bustling with noise. It may be unfair to say that the whole hotel was loud because we were put on the first floor above the entrance and could hear the patrons coming in and out, but several guest could be heard walking through the hotel hallways talking to each other in loud voices...or at least they sounded loud. I know the hotel can't make noise restrictions like they do in hostels but they can do something about the thin walls and windows. Me and my girlfriend have differing opinions of the bathroom. I found the mold growing in between the tiles and on the paint around the ceiling unsettling...the hotel has daily maid service and yet, they don't pay attention to the details that really matter. I really feel like a 3 star hotel should be better than my bathroom at home. The shower was stand-up and had a sliding door track that wasn't properly sealed with caulk so that when one took a shower, water would spill out and puddle near near the door...or soak the towel you put down to stand on. When we realized this, we rolled up the towels and pressed them into the gap between the floor and the track and this fixed it. The shower doors looked relatively new, and as maid service came in every day, this should have been an issue that they should have taken notice of and fixed. The second, and last, day that we spent here started with a fire alarm at 8am (which is terrible when you don't get a good nights' sleep), and no hot water for our shower. So apparently, that problem hasn't been addressed yet. Overall...If you don't care about the 3 things I mentioned above..a good bed, quiet rooms and clean bathrooms, it's a nice hotel. The people are friendly and speak English, Free Wi-Fi is awesome, and it looks like, from the other reviews, that the breakfast is really good.", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cOK hotel, but\u201d", "Author": "sydneymax", "ReviewID": "UR47177336", "Content": "Stayed here for several nights during a trip to Rome in early Oct 2009.

The bathroom was very big though the only problem was there is no shower curtain. You shower in the tub and the bathroom can get quiet wet from the spray. The problems I had with this place were the hot water and poor water pressure. On the first day, the hotel said it was the boiler. While the next three days, it did get progressively better, I honestly do not believe it was a boiler problem. My room was the last corner room on the second floor. I just think being an old building; it just had poor water pressure. You turn on the hot water for about 5 minutes, it eventually comes though not very strong. The other problem was internet access. While each room had free Ethernet jack access, for whatever reason, it stopped working after using it for about an hour on our first day. No one was ever able to figure out the problem.

Overall, we found this to be a pleasant experience. The room that we stayed in (26) had nice high ceilings and warm furnishings. It was pretty standard in size for a European hotel, the but the high ceilings made the space feel larger than it was. A few areas in the hotel could use a touch of plaster and fresh paint, but it didn't look run down at all. The walls were a bit on the thin side, so you may have a few issues in the morning if you have noisy neighbors. (But why are you sleeping anyway -- you are in Rome?) The street noise was very minimal. The bed itself was a bit firm, but I was fine with that and slept like the dead (although perhaps walking the city non-stop had something to do with that). The bathroom was well-appointed as well, although the shower stall was on the small side, and the door was awkwardly placed by the toilet, so when you opened it, it would hit the bowl of the toilet. One's knees would hit the shower door as well while sitting on the toilet. It was definitely on the cozy side. They really should have scrapped the bidet to make more room. The location was really convenient -- just a few minute walk from the Manzoni train station (along the A train, which heads through Termini towards Piazza di Spagna). There is a tobacco shop on the way (with a pleasant clerk), so you can buy transport tickets here if you don't have close to exact change (the machines in the stations limit the change back to 2 Euro). The staff at the hotel really made the experience. They were all very friendly, and would greet you with a warm smile. The maid even changed out our bedspread on a daily basis, to give a bit of new design to the room (some of the bedspreads are quite vibrant and fun). When we found out that our departing flight took off too early to take the trains, they arranged a car for us (a new E-Class Mercedes, so not bad), so we were able to get to the airport stress-free in plenty of time. The hotel had a breakfast daily as well -- mostly pastries, cereal, meat, cheese, juice, and coffee. It was more than enough to get us going each day.

Going back to the positive, the hotel breakfast is very good, we found we would last through until 2pm or later before needing lunch despite walking almost continuously from 9am. The hotel is within quite easy walking distance of the Coloseum, the Forumand the Palatini.

The area is also marked by the presence of beggars which you should avoid. I stayed with my parents for a total of 10 days at this hotel and it turned out to be a complete disaster which spoilt our enjoyment of the city. As soon as we arrived we knew that our stay was going to be a challenging one-for starters the outside of the hotel looked really old and grotty. As we stepped inside we could hear the loud noise of drilling going on-essential maintenance work taking place during peak season? We were met at reception by a young man called Andreas who briskly gave us the keys to room 20. This room is on the far end of the ground floor and as it turns out is suitable for disabled visitors & so because it is a bit more spacious, it was given to us as a \"triple room\". We found so many problems with this room though! Although the hotel is undergoing a refurbishment programme, room 20 has yet to undergo the transformation and therefore looks ancient. Here is our list of problems: The walls had cracks everywhere (see pic) we had a standing lamp which was either not working or needed bulb replacing No bedside tables so everything had to be placed on the floor Television set-every channel had a grainy picture and only English channel was CNN and this had very bad picture quality Floor not cleaned often so dirt accumulated over days & towels not regularly changed Bathroom mirror had cracks in 3 places-whats that about 7 years of bad luck?! Shower curtain was being held with a rope! Toilet was too low because its suitable for disabled No bath or bidet The shower handle was broken and kept coming off when we turned it on! We hastily complained to Andreas about our issues but were told that we would have to wait until the manager was around as there was nothing he could do. Eventually, after much protesting, we were moved to room 14, also on ground floor . This was a marked improvement as it had a good shower and bidet and the television was in working order. However the room is located right next to reception which meant that there was much talking and phone ringing and loud entrance buzzer noises keeping us awake throughout the night! On the second day, we were awoken at 8am with the sound of drilling-yep! work being carried out at 8am! Where is the common sense I ask! The room was never cleaned during our duration and we found dustballs under the bed so it seems like they only take care of the superficial aspect of cleaning. BREAKFAST-this was very basic and economical, and in our opinion non acceptable for a so called 3* hotel. The bread was prepacked sliced of poor quality; the cheese was spread-so no sight of real cheese then. Cold meats came from packets, and cheap tasting orange juice as well as coffee from machine. On some days if we were lucky we would get fresh fruit. Of what there was, it was not enough, as we found very little ham, salami and bread so when it was gone,it would take ages to be refilled. What concerned us the most was the low spirits of the housemaid and general sombre mood of the place. On one occasion we saw the maid get angry with guests who-God forbid!-had asked for more food to be put on the table as there was nothing! After one week we left for a 3 day trip to Venice which was amazing (we stayed at the Ca Formenta Hotel which is also 3* but absolutely brilliant & worth 4*-management of Emona please take note!!!) but had prebooked a return to Emona for a further 3 days, so with much trepidation left some of our bags at reception. We arrived back at Emona at almost midnight, but had informed reception of our arrival time beforehand, so you would think that they would avoid a repetition of our first visit but-what do you know!-once again we were handed the keys to room 20!!! This made us frustrated because Andreas had deliberately saved the worst room in the hotel for us with the excuse that it was the last one-what a shabby excuse. We were treated really poorly-he was patronising to us, rude & intimidating, & when challenged, he became aggressive at us-basically a bully who didnt care about our wellbeing. One more thing to comment on was a phonecall incident. Before we used our room phone we had asked how much the going rate would be for the country we were calling and we were informed by the managing director, Maria Magdalena Wilkes, that it would cost 60 cents per minute. Later on we asked someone else at reception who gave us the same rate (we wanted to doublecheck this since there was no calling rates list in our room) so we made two 10 min calls. So come paying time Maria gives us an invoice totalling almost 20 Euros for what should have cost less than half! After much arguing she begrudgingly let us pay 7 Euros according to the rate prearranged as a \"special favour\" and told us that phonecalls are more expensive when made outside the hotel. This is complete rubbish as I told her that we had been using an international prepaid phonecard that gave us 25 minutes of talktime for 5 Euros, at which time she became angry & said the case would not be argued. In conclusion, this is an hotel worthy of a 2* rating, and if it had been, we wouldnt have had as much reason to complain. We were most upset with the poor customer service given by every staff member except for the young Indian chap at reception who was always very polite, helpful & attentive. If, at least, staff had been sincerely apologetic & helpful about the situations we were faced with, we feel that we wouldnt have been left with such a negative impression. One final observation: we realise that not every review on this website portrays this hotel as negatively as ours does, and we believe that this may be because half the rooms have been renovated and couples given these rooms will no doubt get a different experience to ours. In addition, the rooms on the first floor have balconies which further add. Perhaps this in itself is enough to negate one's perception of the other aspects of the hotel.

We did manage to eat a full breakfast each day, though. Be sure to ask for an espresso coffee (free and unlimited during breakfast, otherwise 1 Euro during the day. The espresso in the hotel and in Italy in general are NOTHING like what is sold in North America; we ended up drinking two or three espressos a day!!). The location of the hotel is not bad. Trams, a metro station and buses are nearby, and the hotel is walking distance from the Coliseum. There aren't many restaurants in the area though. We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Emona, and would definetely stay there again!", "Date": "August 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ann Arbor, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cNice little place\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3680825", "Content": "This was a cute, smallish hotel off the beaten path in Rome, in a nice, quiet area. Our room was swank and well-decorated and spacious, for Europe! By cab, we could get to everywhere pretty quickly -- I loved it! Some problems, however: a young female front desk attendant got snippy when we showed up for breakfast and found the \"buffet\" foods sparse, pretty much gone. She was supposed to be tending to the food as well, apparently, and she acted like our wanting the meal we paid for was a huge hassle for her. Other front desk people were great, very kind and personable, full of practical info. The day we left, in fact, the owner herself bent over backward to get a cab to the train station for us -- she was great! Only other complaint -- more having to do with location than the actual hotel -- is don't even bother walking around looking for places to eat; except for a locals place around the corner, there's nothing!! Not kidding! The hubby and I walked and walked and walked and found nothing but a couple bars that had some old-looking sammiches and some tiny pizzerias. So save your feet some wear and tear and hail a cab when you're ready for din-din!", "Date": "July 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cCharming Courtyard\u201d", "Author": "MaggiesWorld", "ReviewID": "UR3633559", "Content": "Stayed here for one night before taking off for another destination. The hotel is within walking distance of Termini, as well as the Manzoni subway stop. If you're coming from the airport, I would suggest just walking to the hotel from Termini-- it's only about 10 minutes away (keep in mind, however, that the streets are cobblestone and the sidewalks are not much help when you're pulling your luggage). I found that for this location, transferring over to the subway does not really cut much off from your travel time. That said: The hotel was very cute, charming, and clean. I was happily surprised at the size of the bedroom-- it was much larger than I expected. We were on the first floor, and the window faced the street (as well as the front gate), but the noise was not really an issue since we had the air conditioning going. The staff was very accomodating, and even though the room was not equipped with a mini bar, we were able to purchase drinks from the front desk. My favorite part of the hotel was the little gated courtyard. There were a number of lemon and orange trees, as well as carefully-tended roses and herbs. My husband and I enjoyed sitting in the garden late into the night. The hotel was not the cheapest around, but the price was reasonable and we enjoyed our stay.", "Date": "July 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cerritos, CA", "Title": "\u201cThe hotel was so great!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3477507", "Content": "My Daughter and I were there during the Conclave (choosing the new Pope) the hotel was a bit far from the Vatican, but 5 min walk to the metro made it very easy to get there each day.

It wasn't until my friends and I had paid our bill and were about to leave that we noticed the extra 70 euro charge. When I asked what the extra charge was for I was told it was because we had invited a couple of friends to our room and this is against hotel policy. This was not mentioned to us when we checked in and they only stayed for a maximum of 2 hours. Since returning to the UK I have been emailing the Manager to try and get a refund without success.

The room I stayed in (#18) is euro-sized, but comfortable. It is right next to the management desk/area and on the street so it is a bit noisy. What bumps it up from being just average is the large bathroom with the fantastic shower. After a long day of touring, I really looked forward to the massaging jets of the shower module.
