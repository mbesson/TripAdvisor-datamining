Also, it is very close to the Sagrada Familia which was one of the main tourist attractions I wanted to visit in Barcelona. The hotel is quite new (my taxi driver didn't know it existed), and so everything is bright and shiny. The building, breakfast room and guest rooms are all simply and modernly furnsihed. Pros: Friendly and helpful staff; good value for Barcelona; great location about a block and a half from the Monumental subway station and a 5-minute walk to Sagrada Familia; fabulous breakfast (Tip - breakfast is included if you book throughthe hotel website; extra if you book through a travel website); clean and modern rooms; there is a great supermarket called LIDL a few blocks away to get bottled water, drinks, fruit or snacks. Cons: Rooms are quite small and spartan. There is no coffee machine; my shower leaked; there is not a lot of good restaurants in the area, but again, it is close to a subway and downtown is quickly and easily accessible. All-in-all, I would recommend this hotel and would definitely return.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calenzano, Italy", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "silviaantonelli", "ReviewID": "UR121680305", "Content": "Bed Washington quite small,but we got the room on 7th floor,with a huge balcony with table and seats.the hotel is simple,but rooms are clean and staff can also understand italian.breakfast is very good and it a for free if u book it by hotel website.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cHonestly, a lot more than a 2 star Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ieily", "ReviewID": "UR120908616", "Content": "First thing first I just want to point out that this is categorized as a 2 star property, even though it is comparable to a 3 star superior in my opinion, so all the reviews saying that breakfast is poor (not true, adequate and good, fresh products too), no fridge in the room, no bar or restaurant just a vending machine and a coins operated computer next to reception (1\u20ac for 5 mins)should just book a full 3 or 4 star property that is required to have all those services. My experience has been a really positive one: Location - the Hotel is reall well located in the safe and residential area of the Eixample, 10 minutes slow walk to Sagrada Familia and a mere 3 minutes from Metro stop \"Monumental\" which takes you to super central Passeig de Gracia or Universitat on purple metro line L2 in 2-3 stops (buy a metro travelcard at machines in metro stations - a lot cheaper than single tickets). Staff - kind, competent and accomodating without being intrusive. Ask for a wi-fi code to desk staff, they give you a userid and password, only 1 user at a time tho.They also store luggage all day if you have a late flight in a locked room. Rooms - CONS: a little on the small side, decor and layout is fairly basic, a small desk and 1 bedside table only, no table lamps, no tea/coffee facilities. Careful if you have a bathtub getting out of it is really awkward. PROS: super clean rooms; more than adequate wardrobe space, modern and new furniture, comfortable beds (only doubles, no kings!) 2 soft pillows, blankets, laundry service, 21\" LCD tv, air con, modern bathroom with big shower but no shelves to put stuff, water pressure always perfect and hot water always present, hairdryer too and plenty of good towels. Stayed 4 nights and been initially given a double room with interconnecting doors we could hear absolutely everything in the room next to us, this means that if you have a quiet and respectful neighbour is ok, like it was the first 3 nights for us but if you get the younger couple who returns late and makes plenty of racket then you are waken up at 3am and it's not a nice thing. We went to reception quite upset and the nice staff clerk told us we could change room first thing in the morning when they would have a free room to give us and so they did, the very next morning we swapped for a room on 4th floor facing the back of the building (much quieter) with no interconnecting doors and much much better in terms of noise. Just so you know avoid the 6th floor (or pick that one accordingly) if you don't smoke because it is the only smoking floor they have. I personally loved this hotel, can't fault it (except for the thin interconnecting door) in any way and will surely be back.

The rooms are nicely decorated, very modern and bright and the airconditioner is working very well and is easily regulable. Also you can open the windows if you like. The staff is very helpful because I called to get a quite room and they gave us a room towards the back and in one of the upper floors, which was perfect and very silent (apart from the neighbors which you do hear a bit).

We were very impressed with the location of the hotel, as it was a mere 2 minutes from the nearest metro- monumental- which you could travel to Passieg de Gracia in very little time, this made it easy to commute and visit the various places around Barcelona- from the beach to further away attractions like Parc Guell. The Sagrada famillia was also a quick five minute walk away and surrounded by some good restaurants if you didn't want to travel far from the hotel at night. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was what we were expecting with a mixture of meats, cheeses, yoghurts, coffee and pastries- although there was the nice addition of a Spanish omelette and eggs. The room was clean and modern, and although it lacked a good view of the surroundings- it was well kept and a good place to spend the night. As many reviews have said the walls were thin and you could hear noise, but we didn't find it much of a problem as it was only really loud throughout the day, but some nights we could hear noises from rowdy people coming back to the hotel. The bathroom was a good size as although slightly small, there was a large mirror and plug right next to it, also the shower was a very good size. There weren't that many amenities in the room such as a safe although you could get reception to place valuables such as passports in their safe, however there was a flat screen TV in the room but it lacked any English channels, although there was a computer downstairs which you could pay to use and free wifi throughout the hotel. Overall it was a very good hotel if you were on a smaller budget looking to spend little time there through the day, and simply wanted to explore the delights of Barcelona. Clean, well kept and safe.

It is in a great location and very accessible for all the sights. My teenage daughter and I felt safe travelling back as lone women at night time.
