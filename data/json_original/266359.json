It's totally worth the price, given that the towels are changed every day, the rooms have a shower and the reception staff is available day and night. My room was clean, although I spotted some ash on the balcony. The shutter broke during the last day I spent there, so I didn't have any problem with it (that would definitely have been a problem if it hadn't broken during my last accommodation day, given the windows are not carefully insulated and I could feel draughts with the shutter left open). All in all, I suggest this hotel to young people who just need a place where to sleep and have a shower. Uh, to come to think of it, I didn't have my breakfast brought to the room, given I was told by a friend it's not even worth the name breakfast -on top of that, there are tons of places where to have breakfast, like Chocolater\u00eda de San Gin\u00e9s serving typical \"chocolate con churros\" (terrific) and Starbucks, which are located extremely near the hostel.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pirassununga", "Title": "\u201cbad hostal\u201d", "Author": "VandaPirassununga", "ReviewID": "UR120470469", "Content": "The place, just the place is good.

The first review found was very negative. Fact is the price is low and you do not expect a 5 stars hotel for it. The Hostal is very well situated in the Center of Madrid. One on vacation will not stay in the hostal the whole day. So get out and visit Madrid as it is a beautiful city. You ring the bell and the door opens. You take a lift (not an old stair) and get up to the Hostal. The person at the reception is very friendly and speaks various languages. You get a map of Madrid and good advice where to go if you do not want to spend a fortune eating. We took a small room for two persons. This was a small room but who cares when you spend your day outside. The bathroom has all what you need for two persons. The room was kept very clean every day. (The cleaning soap used was too strong though.) This is for the plus points. What I would object though is the smell coming from the sewer through the sink, the bathtube and at time even the window. The window of the room was to a tinny courtyard. Being in Spain you can expect some noise at night.

There are a couple of reviews saying the stairs are dark, they had sensor lights so it wasn't a problem. The room is a bit hit and miss with a pretty dodgy shower, however they are also priced accordingly.

The reception is on the 3rd floor up quite a dark staircase with a rather old and small lift. The room was tiny with the double bed filling most of the floor space, but adequate and clean. The bathroom was even smaller with very little hot water at the end of the day. Our balcony was tiny, but you could sit on the aircon box or push a chair halfway out of the French door. The aircon was slow to get cool and is 5E a day, TV free, 1.50E a day for security box. No plug in our bathroom sink; luckily we always carry a travel one. There is a little shop selling beer, wine, and other supplies 3 doors down. The best thing about this hotel is that it is just through the arch from Plaza Mayor which is like a small version of St Mark's Square, Venice. There were free concerts on when we were there. There is also a very nice square on the other side of our hotel which was great for people watching. MADRID IS AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL - even nicer than Rome!

Since that seemed fully booked, hostal Tijcal was an evident option. the location of this hostel, at Plaza Mayor and near Puerto del Sol is perfect. the environment is clean and safe and not noisy. The room was basic, small, especially the bathroom, but this is not a major issue, after all, you don't stay in Madrid to live in a hotelroom. You will have to pay for any additional services/goods (airco, additional towel, etc...) and bring your own showerproducts. There are cold drinks available in a machine at the reception (the hot drinks part was broken) Everything was clean and well kept, the staff at reception were very friendly. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in a safe and budget friendly environment. Three remarks though: - the hostel website stated there was WiFi. When I got there, my laptop did receive the connection, but it was secured. When I asked the reception about the WiFi, I was told that there was no internet in the hostel, becausing they were reinstalling it (sic). I don't know why they lied, but I was not pleased, because I needed access for work - very heavy construction work started in the building at 8 am sharp. By heavy I mean, outside walls were broken apart, underneath my window!

To compensate, the staff offered us free use of the air conditioning, and a token for a bit of breakfast at a local cafe.
