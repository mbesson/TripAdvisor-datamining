Some rooms have bath and shower and others have just shower (big double) - you should request at booking what your preference may be. Beds comfortable, rooms very clean and tidy, mini bar, wifi. Prices vary with the season and that is understandable because of the loation. Breakfast is standard \"European\" and priced at 10 euro - I only took some mornings as I worked near by.

We had a room in the front, from which we could see the port. Because of the double windows, you don't hear any noise from the street. We loved the way the room was decorated, the beds were large and comfortable and all amenities were good: flatscreen TV (mostly spanish channels and cnn-stuff, though), large bathroom with good rainshower. The guys at the reception were really nice (one of them, Jan, is Dutch, which is of course especially nice for Dutch guests such as ourselves). The location is absolutely great. Right by the harbour, and all the nice neighbourhoods such as La Rambla, El Born, Barceloneta, Mare Magnum and the Gothic Quarter can all be reached within a few minutes walk. There are many nice tapas bars in the direct neighborhood of the hotel. We didn't take breakfast in the hotel. However, I attempted to have diner there in the hotel restaurant, but wouldn't recommend it. The waiters seem slow and incompetent and don't speak English and I didn't like the food. The only thing that could be better was that the walls between rooms are not soundproof. We could hear everything in the room next door. One night, our neighbors were watching a soccer match (with all the necessary cheering and hollering) until after midnight, but luckily it stopped immediately after we called the reception about this. The other nights were completely quiet. One other minor thing is that the temperature of the central heating could not be regulated from our room so we had to use the aircon, which is of course not very ecologic.

Besides the hallway and the \"bedroom\" the room also had another little extra room (not closed off) where there was great closet space and a sitting area. Perfect place to have the baby-cot without needing to disturb her with our pacing back and forth in the room. However, we had a sneek peek into room 407 when the cleaninglady was in there and that room is not at all as big, so we were just lucky. A big plus is the great soundproofing from outside. The World Cup finals meant there was a lot of rucket outside, but in our room we had to open the doors to even hear it! There is a small pool, and for just taking a quick dip it is great! My only complaint is that the area around the pool gets way too hot during the day and our daughter was a bit too fast for us quite a few times and started shrieking as she had stepped out of the shade and onto the burning wood. The staff was really nice, helping us finding good supermarkets and supplying maps, pens and other help. I also agree with others that this is more a 4-star than a 3-star hotel.

A great tip is to use the Metro, buy a T10 card which allows you to make 10 independent trips, and it only costs you (in total) about 8 Euro.

After checking out, checked my bank statement to find an extra 17 Euro charge to my credit card. Emailed hotel for an explanation and was told it was for taking a bottle of water and champagne from the mini bar. I explained I did not even open the mini bar let alone take a bottle of champagne so demanded a refund for the 17 Euros. The hotel sent a standard reply about mini bar usage and no refund. So I phoned the hotel twice from London spoke Sergei on reception to further explain, also including the cleaner came into my room just before I left, looked in the mini bar and said \"nada\". Sergei said it is down to the management to decide upon a refund. I told him due you really think I would ring all the way from London if I did use the mini bar. He agreed I would not. Waited a few more days still no further response. So I emailed the company directors the full story. I received a replying saying \"even though we know you took the items from the mini bar we are going to refund the 17 Euros\". Then the last part of the email said \"We would be pleased if you chose another hotel on your next visit to Barcelona\". So the Hotel Catolonia Port are calling me a liar. Great customer service? Eventually received my refund. Shame about the terrible service as the hotel itself is quite nice. But i dont fancy being charged for mini bar usage or being called a liar so will not be returning.

After traveling over 20 hours to get here from Bangkok, we arrived tired, but happy and were initially very pleased with the cleanliness of the hotel and our clean and spacious room. At check-in, however, we were surprised at the 37 Euro cost of the extra bed. The bed is a narrow and short single that folds out from a low chair. Sergey, at the front desk showed us an e-mail the hotel had sent us 5 days before our arrival, even though we had booked the room almost 2 months before. When I checked our booking, I noticed that the hotel was offering our same room with free breakfast (not included in our booking). The slightly higher than expected bed cost was a small matter that I thought could easily be resolved by offering us the free breakfast, but when I proposed this to the front desk, Sergey basically told me to get lost. Upon my request, he said he would contact management of the hotel. We had dinner and went to bed exhausted. What happened next was a surprise. We were woken in the middle of the night by the night clerk and he insisted that we tell him then and now whether we wanted the bed for the remainder of our stay. I don't know if the staff had contacted management or decided to do this on their own, but there certainly wasn't any need to do this in the middle of the night. We were unable to go to back to sleep and that is why I'm writing this review now.

It is newly built I believe in 2007 and this shows in the decor finished in wood, glass and slate. We arrived in the evening and checked in. The reception, whilst not rude are not the most friendly of staff and I wonder how good their customer service would be if they had to deal with any problems. We finished checking in and went up to our room. After the usual wrangling with trying to get the electronic key to unlock the door (is it just us or does this happen to everyone?!) we went into our room. Whilst not huge, this was very nicely furnished with a polished black tiled floor, wooden decor, nice large flat screen tv. The bed was attractive with white linen and decorative pillows on the bed. It had a dark brown satin throw on the bottom to complete the effect. The throw had a dirty mark on it and I turned it over to find a clean side, unfortunately the other side was even dirtier! I wonder why this is not cleaned on a regular basis as it spoilt the luxury touch of the bedding? The bathroom was very nice with granite and wood furniture and a modern bath and shower. I am very fussy so inspected the corners for dirt and unfortunately found a bit of a lack of cleaning by the hotel staff! Overall the room was clean though. As it was getting late in the evening we decided to eat in the hotel restaurant and were very pleasantly surprised by the quality and cheap price of the set menu, altough I prefer to eat out rather than in a hotel, I would recommend that others try the restaurant at least once. Our room looked out onto a side street with offices on the other side, there was no noise coming into the room from the street at all and we enjoyed uninterruped sleep in the comfortable bed. The outside pool area was very nice with wooden decking and lovely deep comfortable chairs, it is very small though the pool is not really big enough to swim in but would be good to dip into to cool off in on a hot day. All in all I would definately recommend this hotel as a good place to stay. The only reservations I would state are the not overly friendly reception staff and the fact that a bit of dirt was starting to build up in the corners of the rooms and the dirty bed throw, whilst the place is new this is not a major problem, but it may start to look a bit shabby as the years go on if this is not rectified.
