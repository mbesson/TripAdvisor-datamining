A few bleach stains on the carpet, which indeed make it look dirty at some spots (mentioned in other reviews), but on the other hand I like to know they use bleach... All members of staff were very polite, helpful and friendly. Breakfast is good and has enough variety: choice of cakes, pastries, cereals, breads, toppings (jams and chocolate paste), fresh fruits (both full and peeled+sliced), salads, eggs (boiled and scrambled... latter one a bit too dry in my opinion), bacon and sausages, juices (non fsh squeezed though), coffee/tea/infusions/chocolate.

The TV is only in italian but who wants tv when youre on holiday anyway? We bought breakfast in the hotel everyday as there were no nearby supermarkets and the cafe close to the metro station didnt look very inviting. The breakfast was continental with a slightly odd twist, cold eggs and chopped up sausages but the pastries were beautiful and a massive selection of fresh fruit. The restaurant that the reception staff reccommend, Conventos, is brilliant. It is the only restaurant close by, about 2mins walk down an unlit alley way, but its well worth the alley once you get there. We happily ate there every evening and the food and service never disappointed, it was full of italians which we felt was a good sign. The Bucatini all' amatrice is to die for!

Our first hotel we stayed at was at the Prime Hotel Area located at the Via del Forte Ostiense near Marconi station. I really thought reading the reviews here would prepare me and my family but i had no idea it would be worst than how it was described here. OK let's start with the positives. Goods: -Close to Marconi train station, a grocery store,restaurants, and mini fruit market -Decent hotel breakfast -Computer with internet available for 2 Euros for per half hour Ok now for the bad parts. On the first day of our arrival we were placed in a room that didn`t have a working shower. So we had to switch room. We were given a room that not only smelled like something had died in but it was dirty as well. That night there was about 300 ants crawling in the bathroom. I wish I had taken photos that night becuase it was something to see. From the bottom on the bathroom sink came an assembly line of working ants moving white pieces of some chunky stuff up to where the shower nosle was. Im not sqweemish about ants but it`s safe to say it made my skin crawl just thinking they might be in my room. Before going to bed I found a bed bug (red) and I immediately killed it and after inspecting the sheets I thought that was the end of that.The next morning I woke up with red spots on my legs and my right side. It was itchy and red. After complaining to the current owner -Giovanni- he said he would get housekeeping to take care of it. Instead the next night more ants showed up. My sheets were only changed one time after I complained even though I was told the hotel`s policy is that they are supposed to change it every morning. We stayed there for more than 4 nights. The hotel staff were completly inexperienced and only two showed professionalism. The rest need some serious training including the new management. It`s a very depressing hotel. The views facing to the back is almost like you`re in jail. It was a pretty dissapointing experience to say in the least. Sure the location is good but what good is it when you can`t sleep because you fear more bugs will bite you while you are sleeping which they did in my case.

Rate would be lower if we were not traveling during x'mas & new year holidays (we initially planned to go during early Dec and i did search cheaper package deal from lastminute.com during early Dec, but at the end we could only make it during end Dec, still i think 250 GBP was very good deal including air tickets and a good quality hotel with breakfast provided). I had chosen this hotel based on previous reviews during earlier this year, and then read the last 2 reviews with negative feedbacks after i'd booked everything....had to say that i did start to get a bit worried after reading those 2 reviews.... But after spending 4 days / 3 nights in Prime Hotel Area, I think i could offer a more reasonable review on this hotel and answer some of the doubts for others who had also read those 2 negative comments: 1. hotel location: Honestly, it ISN'T that far from city, just 7 metro stations between Termini and Marconi (where the hotel is), and frequency of metro is considered high (less than 5 mins for every train), and from marconi to termini will take less than 15mins metro drive. The bus station isnt too far from the hotel but it takes longer if you prefer to walk less (to metro station) and wait for a bus to go into city areas. BUT< have to say that the hotel can do a better job by offering a easier understanding location map for customers instead of using the google map version cos its quite misleading if you follow the map and use \"Via Ostiense\" cos it would lead to you the highway!!!! (which was exactly what happened to us and i was so scared that i would be run over by those cars on the highway!!!!) While we could actually follow directly the road outside metro station, which means after you leave metro station to the ground entrance, turn left and keep walking for 5-8mins until you see a very very old gas station in opposite road, then you cross at the traffic light and after you arrive at the old gas station, you'll see hotel sign when you turn right after the gas station and see the hotel within 500cm... Just one direct road to walk back and forth to and from the metro station <-> hotel. Straight forward and no difficulty at all! Night time walking back to the hotel however was abit too quiet but the area seems ok, we (2 girls) went back to hotel every night at least after 9pm and we are totally fine :) still i receommend at least 2 of you walking together rather than alone... 2. Breakfast options: Fairly speaking, for a budget rate hotel in big city like Rome, this one has done their job with breakfast selection, they offer assorted bread / crossiants, yoghurt in original flavor / mixed berries / strawberry / peach / banana; fresh fruits like green apples, oranges, mandarins, kiwi fruits; cappucino / latte / hot chocolate from machine (which i think they taste reasonably nice comparing to those i paid 2 - 3euros per cup from cafe shops inside rome city....) i am not too into fruit juice so the juice option doesnt bother me at all but probably maybe a pain for ppl who loves having a glass of real fruit juice for breakfast (if yes, no offend but i do think you gotta raise your budget and book another more expensive hotel......); they also have ham and hot scramble egg. So let's be fair, you dont always get what you pay in every hotel but i think this hotel has done a pretty good job by offering as much variety as possible within a budget. 3. Very limited restaurant options nearby the hotel and without one inside the hotel: Correct, its true, but since it takes me less than 20mins to go back to the hotel from Termini, i dont mind staying in Termini or area near colosseo for dinner / lunch in any of the Trattorias, and also i spent most of the day (and night) outside the hotel and in the tourist areas, whats the point going back to the hotel to have dinner / lunch / or even a drink (well, if i'm spending a sun & beach holidays in resort areas like Bali or Guam, yes, i would definitely need a hotel with nice restaurants options and bars selection). So this part of the comments doesnt bother me at all. So unless you're planning to spend most of your time in Rome to have meals in hotel, otherwise this hotel is definitely not a bad pick :) 4. Hotel staff service: we're very lucky to have Anna to serve us when we checked in and out from the hotel, she's absolutely amazing! She's friendly, speaks fluent english in very polite manner and helpful attitude, gives good advise on bus station direction, and suggestion on getting to the airport by train (never once she recommended us to take limo with any limo company, not once!). She's been very very nice to us and gave us many useful advice for travelling inside the city. But we did meet a very rude male staff from the front desk (an older guy looks like in his 50's...... 5'11 tall roughly), he's complete bad news to the whole hotel's service standard, we also noticed that he's especially rude and nasty to women customers, if you ever have the chance to see him in the hotel, good luck to you and I will definitely hope not to see him again in this hotel!!!! But we were lucky that most of the time we needed help from front desk, Anna was there to help us! Thanks so much for her help again! 5. other ares: room's very tidy and spacious, our friend spent much more to book a hotel in Termini area but the inside of their room cannot compare to ours. Amenities were replenished everyday, hotel's heating is very warm, you wont feel cold at all inside your room and they're not stingy with heating as well!!! Breakfast hall is clean and tidy, food was refilled constantly. The hotel is not noisy at all even it's near the highway :) so if you're looking for a comfortable place to stay in rome within a budget, this is a very good choice. I hope this reviews will help to provide a more objective point of view since the last 2 negative reviews, we all just have to adjust our expectations fairly when you're staying in a budget hotel without be too critisizing.

No bar, no restaurant, nothing to eat or drink in the in the vicinity, and a front desk that almost cost me my flight... Upon arrival my taxi driver (local) couldn't find the place it is in such an odd location. Some five miles south of the city, with a major highway and gas station on one side and a narrow lane the other, the immediate approach gives the impression of a down at heel block of flats. Upon entry things look up with a modern lounge area but it is a vacuous place in the evening. The only restaurant in walking distance is the shockingly bad Lo Convento - never take the short cut but even the main road is dangerous - uneven footpaths, unlit, speeding cars. with a mid evening arrival I ended up eating crisps in my room so little is there in the surrounding area. Breakfast is as poor as you could find even in Italy: tinned fruit, over-sweetened squash not juice, poor coffee and stale rolls while congealed scrambled eggs and chopped frankfurters constitute the hot option - why bother I wonder? But I could forgive all that other than the front desk's unilateral decision not to order me a local cab as i requested upon departure. Instead without asking or telling me they called \"their\" limo company because I was going to the airport. For this a car has to arrive from central Rome - at rush hour! The result was a 50 minute wait for a car to arrive and a huge amount of stress. My assumption: putting a kick back ahead of guests' immediate needs.
