There was a small desk for doing work, although not a lot of surface area. Because it was on the first floor and faced the small, lovely interior courtyard, we escaped the intense sun which I assume flooded the street-facing rooms. Unfortunately we encountered a three-day heat wave in Paris, raising outside temperatures to near 100 degrees F, and the hotel's air conditioning system servicing our room was not adequate to deal with extreme heat. When the temp dropped to more normal levels the air conditioning worked fine. Internet WIFI access came with a 10 euro fee for three days. The small breakfast room served a satisfactory continental breakfast at 14 euros, but there are many patisseries in the neighborhood. The Passy metro is just a few minutes walk from the hotel as well as Trocadero.

There are a few restaurants near the hotel, most notable the bakery two doors down and the place across the street that sells Gelato. At night the area is a little dark but it still seemed very safe. When I stayed at the hotel they were doing renovations so the halls and stairwells were all stripped of paint and all lighting/electrical outlets were a bit exposed.

The rooms themselves are basic but clean and more than enough for the average traveler who is just looking for somewhere to re energize.

There were plenty of cafe's and patisserie around the hotel which made it easy to have a quick breakfast before starting our daily tours. Staff were not the most friendly but they were not rude either, very typically French. I would highly recommend this hotel to families and senior tourists due to the convenience of the location.", "Date": "August 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cA nice hotel, pleasant suprise\u201d", "Author": "kh57ca", "ReviewID": "UR18359266", "Content": "Back in May I was searching for an adequate hotel in Paris for our party of three. This size group ended up being rather difficult to find less expensive hotel options. The Passy Eiffel was the one I chose for a couple reasons. The reviews were okay, although a few negative. They had an option for a party of 3, they had A/C, and the location was reasonably close to the major sites and transportation. We ended up being very happy with the Passy. The hotel staff were very cordial and helpful, the room was surprisingly large..with lots of room for us....and it was clean. The bathroom was very clean and up to date. There was some updating construction going on in the hallway outside the room, but it didn't effect our stay in any sort of negative way. Our room faced the main street, so we had a view of the Eiffel tower out our windows, which was especially nice at night with the tower all lit up. We skipped the hotel breakfast, and utilized a variety of local establishments that had various breads and pastries in the morning. I felt the price was reasonable....when compared to the other options I had researched. The local Passy subway station.....was easy to use and created no issues for us to travel about Paris to the various locations we wanted to visit. I would stay here again.......", "Date": "July 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "casablanca", "Title": "\u201cThere is a robber in this Hotel!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "ben-allien", "ReviewID": "UR17610955", "Content": "I have been stoled in my room.

Being the great procrastinators that we are we waited until a month before our trip to decide on where we would be going. After much research (I am a geek!), we decided on the Passy hotel based on the reviews we read here, availability, location and price. This was our first time in France and neither one of us speak French, so we were a little apprehensive about our hotel and their services. We were very pleased with our stay at the Passy, the staff was extremely helpful and nice. The rooms were very clean, the bed was comfortable, and the view from the Eiffel Tower was not bad either. I am a very light sleeper so I did hear quite a bit of street noise because we were on the street side, but after a couple of long days they seem to not bother me as much. They offer a continental breakfast for 11 euros a person, which we had passed on the first couple of days, but after you realize that a coffee and croissant cost 7 euros and you would still be hungry, 11 euros for all you eat didn't seem like a bad deal at all. The hotel is also located within 2 blocks of the Passy metro station and about 10 minutes walk from 2 other stations. It is a 10 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower and 5 minutes to the Seine. The neighborhood is not very \"turisty\" compared to other areas and it is pretty calm witch was nice after a day of walking 10 miles. The cafe across the street provided us with many dinners as we experienced major sticker shock with the food prices in Paris, and there was a nice liquor store right next door where we would pick up an excellent bottle of Bordeaux for 6.50 euros! If we had the opportunity to go back to Paris one day we would most likely stay at the Passy again. I only say most likely because if we win the lottery we would probably stay at a 5 star hotel instead. :-)", "Date": "January 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent choice for Paris\u201d", "Author": "LADundee", "ReviewID": "UR12327765", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Passy Eiffel with friends for New Year and were very pleased indeed with the hotel. We had booked a standard double room, and while perhaps a little on the small side for some, it had everything that we needed and was spotlessly clean. We were lucky enough to have a room at the front of the hotel, with 2 sets of large french windows which opened to reveal a view of the Eiffel Tower, which at night is simply stunning. When the windows were shut, there was absolutely no problem with noise from the street. The location of the hotel is brilliant. The friends we travelled with had been to Paris 4 times previously, and had usually stayed in the Latin Quarter, but they preferred Passy by far. The close proximity to the Eiffel Tower and the metro is fantastic. Breakfast is also good at the hotel - the croissants and fresh bread are just to die for!! They set you up for a day of sightseeing! Staff were also very helpful and the maids were so cheerful too! All in all, an excellent choice for Paris - good sightseeing base and nice and relaxing neighbourhood to stay in if you like a bit of a gentler pace in the evenings after a long day in the bustling buildings and streets of Paris.", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kabul", "Title": "\u201cWould Pass on Passy\u201d", "Author": "Travelshmavell", "ReviewID": "UR10074483", "Content": "Was a bit disppointed - -although the location was good, the room and breakfast were only okay. The room was a bit on the shoddy side compared to other similarly priced hotels in Paris.

When we asked the reception desk about the room we were told it was a superior, but the next day we saw the list of rooms posted on the wall that clearly indicated the room was a standard. As we were only there for 3 nights and most of the time we were out it did not make sense to swith. Nevertheless, kicker was that upon checkout the bill was at the rate for a superior.

All the staff were excellent from the check ins to the dining staff, room service etc. No restaurant but with so many gorgeous cafes to chose from and with shops close by there was never any problem. Patesseries to die for and the most wonderful chocolate shop close by (Jeff de Bruges).

Easy to communicate with the hotel over email to reserve your room. Bfast was extra and at a high price considering its so easy to go down the street for croissants and fresh fruit at a near by fruit stand which had the best apricots I ever tasted.
