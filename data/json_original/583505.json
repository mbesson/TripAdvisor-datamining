First impressions on arrival were not exactly great, it looks run down from the outside with what appears to be a shed attached to the hotel for a reception. On getting in to our room we were concerned by the wires hanging out the walls, the shower head which was taped on, the damp patches on the walls. So not wanting to spend any more time than was necessary in the hotel we went out pretty early. On arriving back to the hotel we went to bed, sleep for about an hour and were woken with a loud bang. Then we felt water dripping on us. We turned on the light and the light was buzzing and had filled up with water which had came through the roof and was now dripping on to our bed. We went to reception to inform them, the male at the desk did not seem bothered or shocked and just threw another room key at us! This room was no better other than the fact the roof wasnt leaking.

After standing in silence, despite asking questions of the receptionist, and having to search for my own name on the list of guests we were finally given the key to room number 12. The shower had mildew all over walls which were still wet. The shower had to be hand held as the holder on the wall was broken. In addition, I had to turn the shower off during my shower to allow the standing water to drain away. There was a large hole in the ceiling in the bathroom with plaster falling out and a significant draft coming from it. I am unsure what the scratching sounds were above it but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure I can hazard a guess. The sink was dirty and also had standing water. My partner and I were given 3 hand towels for the room. There were two cups complete with tea bags, sugar and milk but the room had no kettle so were rendered useless. The single pane window did not close properly and so it was cold and you could hear everything outside. The TV did not work as the poorly hand modified coax cable did not fit. When I questioned the receptionist and asked for a portable aerial or if they could fix it, I was greeted with the response \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no, we are refurbishing, you can see that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I can categorically deny there was any sign of anything that looked refurbished. The set of drawers contained an empty packet of cigarettes and several screws. The light in the main room on the wall had no bulb. The plug sockets on the wall were coming away from it and did not appear safe.
