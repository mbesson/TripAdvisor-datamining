I'm not sure if I just happened to get the worst room in the hotel and the worst person at reception, but I had a terrible experience. First of all, the room was the most overpriced room for the size I have ever stayed in. There was space in the room for the bed and that's about it. My wife and I had to close our bags and put them away in order to stand up. Seriously. Checking us in the extremely rude and unbelievably arrogant desk clerk smirked and said our room was \"bad.\" I asked him why that was when i had booked the room weeks in advance. He told me that it made no difference. I told him that the room did not match the description or the photos on the hotel website and he told me (I can't believe it, but this is what he said) \"It's like McDonalds. When you go to McDonalds you don't expect the hamburger to look like it does in the pictures.\" I asked to speak to the manager and he told me the manager was not available and there was no way to reach him. The worst room ever and among the worst service ever. That was my experience at the Praktik Metropol.

The room was a good size and had everything you needed including very comfortable beds and high power air con - essential! They have also clearly put a lot of thought into how they designed the rooms in terms of making the most of the space. The bathroom wasn't huge and had no bath but again, they've decorated everything so creatively that you don't mind that it's a little on the cosy side. One of the big advantages is the roof terrace where there are sun loungers and tables and you can take your own food and drink up there if you fancy a picnic with a view.

Only disappointment was lack of a refridgerator in the room - it would have been handy for keeping drinks cool. However, the coffee and doughnuts for 1e were a great way to start the day. Some have commented on the 'ladies of the night' on the main street below - it's true, there are a few, but we certainly were in no way bothered by them!

It's right on the exit of the Grand Via tube stop so you couldn't ask for a more central location in Madrid. It's minutes away from the Puerto Del Sol, which is pretty much where you'll go to access all the best of Madrid's mighty fine city centre. I specifically asked for a high room with a balcony if it was possible, and I wasn't let down. I was told room 901 was the best and I'd be inclined to agree. The balcony had an awesome view over the Grand Via and the rest of Madrid that surrounds it. The room was very big with handy hooks to hang stuff, nice chairs, big wardrobe, massive comfy bed with all the pillows you'll ever need and overall modern, clean, simple decor. Gorgeous bathroom with a huge shower and a small window looking out on that spectacular view. The room was just around the corner from the hotels top floor terrace. This terrace has even better views than room 901 and lovely sun loungers and additional seating. You can go up one more floor once on the terrace and you won't be disappointed. There's an almost 360 degree view of Madrid and it's stunning. We spent a couple of sunsets up here with beers from the local Carrefour supermarket. Perfect way to start your evening! The hotel lobby is a lovely place to hang with some amenities available so that's always handy. I really can't praise this hotel enough. For Madrid, their prices are reasonable and there's so much on the doorstep. Lovely cafes and bar are right outside and the shops of the Grand Via surround the whole hotel. I won't use this review to comment on Madrid, but suffice to say, it's my favourite European city and staying at the Praktik Metropole on my second visit even better than my first.

The hotel is more like a hostel in that it\u2019s housed on several floors of an old building along with a couple of other hostels. The main reception area is spacious and trendy with friendly reception staff and vending machines which came in handy for water etc. as free computers. To be honest my heart sank when I saw my single room, it was the tiniest room I\u2019d ever seen. With a small window that looked into the shaft of the building. My Dad and brother shared a room next door which was a bit bigger being a twin room. After about 5 minutes I settled in nicely, the main reason being is that the rooms are very well designed and there is a space for everything to hide away so I actually got used to my small room and ended up liking it. The rooms are simple, clean with a cool design aesthetic with everything you need including a safe, flat screen TV, big wardrobe, toiletries and good shower. The beds are comfortable and I got a good night's sleep (or siesta) due to the room being an internal one, it stayed dark quite a lot. Although, I could have done with a stronger ligh to do my make-up because of this! They were also cleaned every day which was good, however, I would have liked a fresh towel every day although you can ask for this at reception- they change them every 3 days if not. Yes, the building is located on a street with a lot of hookers, they don\u2019t cause anyone any bother from what we could see and the street was good for people watching from one of the bars outside. However, be aware of pickpockets on Calle Montera (and of course the whole of Madrid). Unfortunately my brother had his new sunglasses stolen by a group of young Romanians whilst he was sat outside one of the bars outside the hotel. They brought over a piece of paper pretending to collect for charity and placed the piece of paper over the sunglasses which were (stupidly) put on the table. This was despite us already telling a couple of them where to go, another 3 girls returned and took the sunglasses. The guy at the bar was very apologetic but it wasn\u2019t his fault. We reported it to the police and we did notice lots of police patrolling the area but it\u2019s just one of those things. The incident wasn\u2019t a reflection on the hotel at all and I certainly felt safe on the street and surrounding area. Which brings me to the location \u2013 which was brilliant. Just off Gran Via and up the street from Sol. We walked to most places including Chueca, Malasana, Plaza de Santa Ana, Plaza Mayor and Prado/Reina Sofia galleries. The rooftop is also a highlight; it\u2019s well-kept with plenty of nice sun loungers and views over the rooftops. I wish I\u2019d had more time to chill up there but there\u2019s so much to do in Madrid!

Overall, I thought it was a great value for the money. I got a double superior room for an average of less than 100 dollars a night, one of the better values in all my years of travelling around Europe. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Positives of the Metropol include the location right next to the Gran Via Metro stop, which means that everything most people want to see is within walking distance. From the airport I would take the Aeropuerto express (5 euros) to Place/Plaza Cibeles and walk about 10-15 minutes to the hotel. The ladies of the night (who seem to work day and night) outside the hotel were no bother at all, but I could see why some might rather not see the all the time. The main lobby on the second floor is quite nice in a quirky sort of way. I enjoyed sitting there in the morning with my 1 euro coffee and donut. There are two computers in the lobby with a printer for guests, though the free wifi in my room worked flawlessly. My room was a nice size and spotlessly clean, though this was the top end room and I wonder about the size of the more basic rooms. If you can spare the extra 10-15 euros, splurge for the larger room. The white decor is pleasant and cool. The air conditioning worked very well, which can be critical during the Madrid summer. The glazing on the windows was great and I never heard a sound from the busy street below. The people at the front desk were fine, though the women tended to be a little friendlier than the guys. The only real negative of the room was a slight odor at times, which the management seems be aware of based on responses to some previous reviews. Apparently it has something to do with broken pipes it is trying to get permission from the city to fix. In the meantime, I would suggest they get a few room deodorizers and place them in the bathrooms. That should do the trick as the smell is not that strong. The only thing about the hotel I really did not like was no one at the reception desk from 23:00-7:00. During those hours there is only a security person at the front door. One night I left my key in the room as I left the hotel a little after 11:00, and getting the security person to understand and help me was bit difficult (luckily I found someone at the front desk working a little late).

As someone else has observed, it is somewhere between a hotel and a hostel - but while that might sound off-putting, it actually makes for a very pleasant, relaxed stay. In fairness it is much closer to \"hotel\" - it even has its own rooftop terrace (separated from the hotel proper by 5 floors that manage to contain a further 3? hostals!). The views from the terrace were spectacular. Its location is superb: 10mins from Prado; right on Gran Via and only 20metres from the metro. We found the receptionists to be helpful and friendly, and the whole check-in and check-out process was very easy. The reception also sells the Nespresso capsules for the coffee machine., and we found the 1 Euro coffee + donut deal unbeatable! However, if you don't fancy that, then there's plenty of cafes within 100 metres. Also within that 100 metres is a micro-red light district. In the pedestrianised street outside the hotel (and seemingly ONLY in that part of the street) a number of \"ladies of easy virtue\" ply their trade - morning, noon and night. It is clearly a trade tolerated within this small area, but seems odd to be happening alongside the regular hurly-burly of a busy street.

Although the hotel was full the room insulation was excellent and we barely heard our fellow guests. The roof balcony complete with sun loungers is a nice bonus. Staff spoke excellent English and were friendly and helpful. Travelling to and from the hotel was a doddle. The new Renfe train service signed \"ferrocarril\" at the airport Terminal 4) takes you direct to Atocha station and from there Metro Line 1 takes you to Gran Via. Use the C Montero exit and the hotel is directly in front of you. Using this route is not only quicker but cuts out lots of steps on the Metro. One final tip - you never know who might be a pickpocket in Madrid or where they might have a go. Women especially should ensure that they can reverse their backpacks so that no zip pockets are easily accessible.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cThe smallest of rooms centrally located\u201d", "Author": "GEDLosAngeles_CA", "ReviewID": "UR130137925", "Content": "The only question to ask oneself about this value hotel is: how many nights could one possibly stand being in a hotel with such small rooms?

It is a few minutes' walk either to the Prado, the Retiro Park, the Plaza de Espagna, etc. But how many times can one wait minutes for an elevator? How many pivots can one make in a hotel room to step around one's mate so as to get into the bathroom? And how many times does one want to walk past a passel of prostitutes in order to enter the hotel? All the above stated, this hotel seemed to be fine for the many young folks who chose to stay here. Maybe it was the low cost or the somewhat stylish old-style design. Perhaps it was the public computers that a young Mom thought was ok for her little daughter to play with while a line of people waited to print out their airport boarding passes.

Loved the hooks on the wall surrounding the inside of our room! Honestly, this is the best feature I've seen in a hotel room besides WiFi.

We take a trip every year around this time for our wedding anniversary and my birthday. I had narrowed down my choices to just a handful of hotels; however, by the time I was ready to book the airfare prices were going up while my budget remained the same. I called expedia to complete the booking once I found a flight and hotel package that was reasonable. I was able to create a package with two destinations, albeit without regional flights, but I added in a hotel that I was not interested in using in Barcelona (simply to see pricing). The Barcelona apartment that I wanted to book was not available on expedia. As I was on the phone with expedia, the price of the flights kept changing. The price of my 1 hotel and 3 flight package went up by $91 by the time the booking was complete due to flight pricing. I found Praktik Metropol on expedia when opening up my search for more budget friendly hotels. Arrival: We took the train (metro aka subway) from the airport. We are from NYC and have used the NYC subway aka metro often. The Praktik hotel was easy to find, right in the middle of everything, off Gran Via. Transit to hotel from airport requires multiple transfers. We followed the directions on the hotel website: From the Barajas airport take underground Line 8 from the National Terminal (Terminal Nacional [T2] towards the Nuevos Ministerios stop. We later learned that you can get the metro from Terminal 4 which is where our plane landed. Once you reach the end of the line (Nuevos Ministerios station), change to Line 10 travelling towards Puerta del Sur and change trains again at the Alonso Mart\u00ednez station. At Alonso Mart\u00ednez, change to Line 5 towards Casa de Campo, and get off at the Gran V\u00eda station. The hotel is directly in front of the underground stop. The route from the airport to the Hotel Praktik Metropol took about 1 hour since we took the free airport transfer to Terminal 2 from Terminal 4. We had to wait on other travelers, one of which seemed to literally be moving his kitchen cabinets from Barcelona to Madrid via the shuttle bus. We paid \u20ac2.50 per person. There are not a lot of elevators in the metro so you will need to carry your baggage up and down stairs. A taxi is about 30 minutes and much more expensive. Check-in: The reception for the hotel is on the first floor, shared with several hostels that do not occupy the entire building. Be sure to enter the correct part of the building for Praktik. There was a door person to direct us to the correct location. The elevator is tiny. My husband took up the suitcases in the tiny elevator while I carried the hand luggage up the stairs to reception (2nd floor). Both of us would not fit in the elevator with our luggage (4 pieces). There were a lot of guests hanging out in the lobby reading the paper and on their laptops when we arrived on a Saturday afternoon. We later learned why. Fast and friendly check-in: Check in was fast and although I was trying to practice my Spanish, it was done in English. We were given room 221 which I liken to a prison cell. It is an interior view room that looks out onto the duct work, duct work which could use a good cleaning. We had just come from Barcelona where we rented a 1 bedroom apartment with kitchen, dinette and living room so this tiny hotel room at the Praktik made me feel like a convict locked away in a cell. Within minutes of seeing the room, we tried to move to a larger room but the hotel was fully booked. There was about 1 foot of space around the perimeter of the king sized bed. The bed, two twins (or doubles) pushed together, was on wheels. It made for an interesting night when the beds started to slip apart. The beds were very firm, not a pro unless you prefer a firm bed. I recommend some kind of wheel locks for the beds to keep this from happening to other guests. We kept the bathroom doors open to give the impression of a larger space. Luckily we did not spend a ton of time in our room, otherwise it might have been unbearable to be in such tight quarters. We kept the curtains closed for our entire trip. We figured out that the tiny rooms was the reason so many guests were probably hanging out in the lobby when we arrived. We did use the pegs on the wall to hang up our clothes. My husband enjoyed using the pegs to keep the room less cluttered. Pros: Location \u2013 steps away from the metro/subway and bus, walk to Puerto del Sol in 5 minutes, walk to Plaza Mayor in 10 minutes, walk to Calle de Cava Baja in 12 minutes. We walked everywhere and did not use the metro at all in the city except to get to/from the airport and the AVE train to Valencia. I would book this hotel again simply for the location. Price \u2013 unsure, part of a flight/hotel package; if booked separately I priced the hotel at 206.81 Euro total for 4 nights (this was equivalent to $331 USD at the time) Newly renovated - everything still looked pretty new (loved the shower head) and it was sturdy/solid construction. Fee wifi \u2013 internet access in rooms and throughout hotel (free printing in the reception area) Walking distance to major tourists attractions 1 Euro breakfast (coffee, donut) - we did not partake Police station nearby - about halfway down the block Hair dryer, hand soap, bath gel and shampoo provided (we did not use the hair products) Cons: Very small room by American standards \u2013 maybe not by European standards Loud pipes - we could hear toilets flushing pretty often No counter space or shelves in the bathroom to store anything Not enough sound proofing - we could hear the other guests talking on different floors as well as hear doors opening and closing throughout the day and night. We have this same issue at home in NYC so it was not a problem, just an observation. Front door to the building, although guarded, does not seem to close. This makes for a very chilly hallway when the temperature is low. No closet; I hate living out of a suitcase but I knew prior to booking that there was no closet. Instead there is a cubby area with shelves and a couple of hangers. It was sufficient for us. Pro/Con depending on your preference: towels changed every 3 days electricity works only when room key is inserted into the wall slot (this is becoming the norm in a lot of countries) *There are a number of reviews that mention the prostitutes. We did not find them to be a problem at all. They did not approach us. If they do approach you, it is easy enough to decline their services. They are not aggressive by any means, just trying to get work for those who are interested in a \u201cdate\u201d. Checkout: Fast and friendly. We left our luggage while we went to grab lunch prior to our flight. Our room key stopped working promptly at 12 pm so we had to get access again to collect our luggage. Train to the Airport: Rather than take the metro back to the airport we decided to try the renfe train. We discovered this option on our trip to Valencia for Las Fallas. The metro (Line 1) to Atocha Renfe is 3 Euros and then you can take the renfe train (C-1) to the airport. That is an additional 5 Euros (2.5 euro per person). It was a more direct route than changing metro trains several times. We never did get to see the balcony on the 9th floor which I understood was public. When we tried to visit, our room key did not allow us to access the 9th floor at all. We did not bother to check with reception for access since we were checking out at the time. All in all we would use Praktik again, but we would probably get a bigger room and maybe a room with a view.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dallas", "Title": "\u201cWell placed and clean\u201d", "Author": "notimetolouse", "ReviewID": "UR126516462", "Content": "We wound up our trip to Spain with three nights in Madrid.

The staff at the front desk were very helpful and the while they don't offer breakfast the 2 coffees + donut for a 1 euro can't be beat.

As one can tell from the photos the rooms are very small, there are built in cabinets with shelves and otw there is about two feet of space around the bed(at least in our room. Our friends room had enough space for a small coffee table and chairs). Note the wall pegs in the photos. They are all around the room and actually quite handy in a small room for keeping things from getting so cluttered. The bathroom was about 4 by 8 with a nice walkin shower. They had good fixtures and adequate towels. Bath amenities includes a round bar of soap which was replaced daily, and some shampoo and conditioner. The hotel is ideally located about 300 yards from Puerta del Sol and within waking distance of all the important stuff (Prado, etc.). There are lots of places to eat around although I cannot attest to the quality of most of them. It is in a very active, energetic area and about 50 feet from the metro stop. Now, out side the hotel are a bevy of very young and slender hookers that are there arout 24/7 come he** or high water. Like R. Steves says, they look like high school girls who are sneaking out for a smoke. They are of no bother and if one approaches you, you just say \"no thanks\" and that is it. BTW, there is a police station about 100 yards down the way. Please note in the photos that the hallways , though narrow, are plastered with posters of movies, shows, and the likes which gives the place sort of an energy. The reception is in a big hall sort of a room with couches and two computers(there is also wifi). The\"go to\" girl there is Elena, very energetic, and helpful and speaks good English. The rest of the staff was helpful also. Perhaps the most disconcerting, if not very irritating thing, for our room was that across the street was a building that had a mass of big TV like screens that cast a lot of light pollution into our room until around 2 AM if not later. The two sets of French doors kept out the noise satisfactorily but the curtains were inadequate for the excess light coming through. All the manager would have to do is intall a room darkening curtain and the problem would be solved.( I passed this advice on to the desk clerk so the manager cannot say he is not aware of the problem and a solution). When we were there the place was at capacity and I was told by a desk clerk that it often is especially in the spring. This place was comfortable enough,the residents all seemed to be a happy, congenial lot but is is a bit of a wierd place. I do not feel comfortable in giving the place more than an average recommendation since it seems to be more of a budget type hotel than a full service type of place. I would say that you need a youthful attitude and outlook to tolerate a stay here.

It could not be in a more central location. It has superb, design magazine d\u00e9cor. Also a great common area \u2013 the ground level lobby/reception area is very small, but the floor above has a huge, wonderfully furnished living room with great light and views. The guest rooms have high ceilings and great fixtures/furnishings. I have never slept in more comfortable beds. The in-room safes are big enough for laptops. Climate controls are responsive. Wifi throughout the hotel is strong and free of charge. My only complaint has been mentioned by others; the bathrooms have clear glass doors. In our room, at least, the toilet was right in front of those doors. So when you sit on the can, you are in full view of anyone in the main room. This is just bizarre, and they need to do something about it. (And yes, as others have mentioned, the pedestrian street right in front of this hotel is sex worker central. It\u2019s not a seedy area by any means; it just has a lot of pedestrian traffic, so this is where they ply their trade. They are forward \u2013 at least if you are a man between 15 and 80 \u2013 but not unpleasant. This didn\u2019t bother me in the least, but it seems in the spirit of TripAdvisor to mention this to people who may feel differently.)

However you get what you pay for. The rooms are clearly new (still smelt of paint/polish) but are tiny. We had around a 2m x 3m area between the bed and the bathroom. Also the bathroom doors are see through! In areas the hotel seemed unfinished as we noticed printed out pieces of paper blu-tacked on the walls to direct you to the room numbers. The upper two floors are hostel rooms. We also got woken up early every day by the cleaners shouting down the corridor. Don't expect a lie in! There is a lovely communal area which has boxes of pastries to help yourself to in the morning and coffee and vending machines and free use of two internet stations which is handy for travelers. However the main thing to note is that the hotel is located on the main prostitute street of Madrid. The corner of the hotel backs onto the Gran Via so it's always a very lively area but there are constant prostitutes hanging around right outside and down the street. For the price we paid however, it was fine but would look for an alternative next time.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cBasic, but they get their basics right\u201d", "Author": "PleunBhoy", "ReviewID": "UR118337398", "Content": "Basic hotel on great location in the heart of the city.

Rain shower head. Great location. Subway entrance right outside the main door, and there is a nice shopping district to the north. At first I was concerned that the hotel would be noisy since it is right on the busy Gran Via, but the double glazed windows arrested the street sounds nicely. You can tell that they are still working out the bugs of running a hotel, but the benefit is that everything is clean and fresh, from the bathroom grout to the paint on the walls. One minor inconvenience is that there is no fridge in the hotel... for medications or for food and wine. We stayed on the fourth floor and enjoyed a balcony view of Gran Via. Side note: my new happy place is the Parque del Retiro. Do as the locals do, and spread a blanket out by the monument overlooking the rowboats on the lake. Fantastic place to journal, read, or just enjoy the setting sun. Can't wait to go back.

My husband and I stayed here for the first four nights of its new existance and loved it! Its position, less than one minutes walk from the Grand Via metro is the first of many things to recommend this hotel. Our Room (401) was large and beautifully decorated in white wood panelling - ideal for those hot summer days! The bed was massive and very comfortable, the airconditionin-marvellous and the shower, out of this world! Our room also had a balcony overlooking Gran Via and the pedestrian area beside it. Ideal for people watching on those warm evenings! The room had two huge french windows which when closed provided excellent sound proofing if you need quiet for a good night's sleep. It is 5 mins walk to Puerto de Sol and easy distances from everywhere else in Madrid. The tourist bus stops just across the road. There are lots of eating places right outside the hotel's front door. The very best feature of this hotel however is its EXCELLENT staff - friendly, energetic, enthusiastic and helpful! A wonderful find and rightly deserves to be much higher up the list in Madrid.
