When I came back to the desk after having to make an international call on my cell phone to get my banks fax# that she claimed that she needed to reverse the charge, I suggested, very calmly that if she couldnt deal with a complaint from a customer, because she was pregnant then she should hand over any such complaints to someone that could. The sarcasm dripped from her as she said she \"thanked me for my suggestion\" I am going to see the manager tomorrow, although i wont hold my breath for an apology. At no point in dealing with these 2 different employees did I get any kind of an apology, in fact they suggested and intimated that I was the idiot here and that i should shut my mouth. I was upset by their unprovoked treatment of me that I was unable to go to dinner, I had completely lost my appetite, thank you HO JO for completely ruined my last night in beautiful Vancouver.

There is a wings/beer type restaurant downstairs off the lobby that has some pretty good daily specials. The Stanley Cup playoffs were underway while we were in town, and the Canadians do love their hockey and made a lot of noise during the games in the restaurant, so we decided to join them and had a blast watching our first hockey game over a beer with the locals. There is a common room with a cappucino machine and a microwave above the lobby, and we brought back food from some of the farmers' markets in town and made our dinner there.

We arrived to find it was at the very end of grandville...where all the homeless people and drugies are. They stood outside the hotel and right across the street. We paid 20 dollars for parking which I understand is normal for Vancouver...but usually its for under ground secure parking. This was out on the side of the building with no lights. It looked sketchy and unsafe...but what could we do we had already paid for the hotel and the parking. No one said where the parking was so when I went back out to the car I drove around the building and had to call the front desk and asked where the parking was. As soon as we checked into our room we realized what a freaking dive it was. It was so small and cramped the windows where filthy and it smelled like an old dirty rag that had been left in the sink was used to clean up. There were pipes that ran through the room that where painted. The remote didnt work for the tv. The bed was rock hard. We would have cancelled our hotel but it was non-refundable and everywhere else was booked up or was really expensive. I asked the front desk to come up when we returned from supper to smell the room because it stunk so bad. I had asked them not to go in the room till we had come back as we had left our belongings out including credit cards and other personal information. They went in anyways and just opened up a window to air the place out...when we came back the room still smelled. So we went and bought an air freshener...yes it was that bad. So we tossed and turned all night on the hard bed and got out of there first thing the next morning. I called in a complaint when we arrived home and they said they would get back to me on the 19th of may. Today was the first day anybody contacted me about my issue (may 24th). All the general manager could say was thanks for your complaint and have a good victoria day. Are you kidding me? So I proceeded to ask to speak to someone above her...she wouldnt give me a name and basically told me it was my fault our experience was bad because I didnt complain enough. Rudest costumer service I have had in my entire life...no joke! So I called the customer service line again in hopes that someone else will be able to help me.

The hotel had my lisense plate on file and had my bill showing that I paid for parking on file and should not have authorized my car to be towed. The employee told me that the cars are towed if the parking pass is not displayed on the dash. I left it on the dash. The hotel refunded my 12$ (which I consider to be an admittance of wrong doing). If the hotel knowingly authorized my car to be towed then it is safe to assume that the hotel has a business revennue sharing deal to tow the cars of it's customers. The hotel employee and on duty manager aruged that if the parking pass was not displayed on the dash then the car would be towed and would not budge from that position. I maintain that pass could have been moved by the towing company when they towed my car. They had to enter the car to release the e-break so they totally could have moved it. It is in the towing companies financial interest to lie and say I didn't have a pass or it wasn't in the correct location. The hotel even called the impound lot who claimed to walk to the car and said the pass wasn't in plain site. When I was at the impound lot I later learned that they phone wasn't a cell or cordless phone and She wasn't even checking my car. She was lying to me from a phone in the office that could not see the inside of my car from. I took a cab to the inmpound lot. The cab driver told me that he takes people every day from my hotel to the same impound and hears my story all the time. He also thinks that the hotel has a deal with the tow trunk company. There was another customer in the hotel that was complaining about this issue at the same time as me! They did it to two people on the same day! I got to the impound lot and paid about 100$ to get the car out. When I entered the car I noticed that the parking pass was in the center of the car near the stick shift and e-brake. There is no way that they could have released the e-brake without seeing the pass!! I maintain that I left it on the dash and the towing company moved it because they make money off of towing others people's cares and then charging them to get it back. I then drove back to the hotel to try to get a refund. They would not refund my money or give me any kind of break because they said the pass was not on the dash. Then I noted on the parking pass that it doesn't even say that it has to be displayed on the dash!! They still wouldn't refund my money. They said that a small sign in the parking lot said it had to be on the dash. I pulled in to the lot when it was dark and didn't see the sign because it is not in a well lite area. But that doesn't matter because I left my pass on the dash anyway and it was likely moved by the towing agency. The hotel manager even accused me of parking on the street rather than in her lot! I have the reciepts from the hotel, the towing company, and the parking pass I can fax into the BBB. When I left I accused the employee of having a sweatheart deal with the toe drunk company and he said, \"Yeah we do. I get half or even more depending on how mad i can make you\". These people will scam and rip you off with a smile. Stay away! Not only that but another customer was complaining about being overcharged while another customer said she got stuck in the elevator!!

Awesome location at a great price. Points any tourist would love to have knowledge about before booking a hotel... 1. Location - Extremely convenient right in the center of the downtown area. Bus stop right below the hotel. Train station about 10-15 mins walk from hotel. You could go by bus too. Also, there are many restaurants in the vicinity. The pizza joint bang opposite the hotel was particularly good. You even have Burger King, McDonalds, Subway and a few cheap Chinese restaurants closeby. Most of them are open till atleast 1 am and even later on weekends. It costs abt CAD 25-30 to reach the hotel from the airport. 2. Rooms - Kind of small. But still good. Clean room and clean bathroom with hot water available 24/7. The windows open only at the top and if the AC is not on it can get very stuffy. The rooms facing the roadside are very noisy coz of the club/pub on the ground floor of the hotel. Many a time my sleep was disturbed due to the noise coming from below. Tip: Request for rooms away from roadside. 3. Front office staff - Some of them were good but some were extremely curt. 4. Car Rentals - Hertz and Avis are located closeby. Book on the net to get the best deals. Inspite of the negatives I would stil recommend this hotel due to its awesome location and price. But don't make an international call from your room.

Much has been said in previous reviews about the location which to be honest I didn't find all that bad. If you walk down Granville toward downtown you will pass 3 or 4 sex shops, peep show places etc. but no more than that and no worse than may other European cities I have stayed in. It didn't really feel that seedy and didn't bother me. There are beggars and homeless about and slightly more perhaps that I have usually come across in other major cities. Location wise it is pretty good for Vancouver. You can walk downtown, walk to the Granville Island ferry, walk down to the sea walk. It is a 5 minute walk to Yaletown where there are plenty of good restaurants, bars & coffee shops. The hotel itself is quite different. This is not a 3 or 4 star hotel. It is a cheap hotel despite it's room rates. The lobby and reception are smart enough and to be fair the decor generally was in good condition and clean although everywhere is painted a disgusting colour. Before you take your bags up to your room go and have a look because there is probably about a 80% chance you will want to move. My first room was tiny and very noisy, there was a loud mechanical noise in the room which came from somewhere deep within the building. They changed me no problem to a bigger room but did say that they tend to give the smaller rooms to overnighters, so watch out for that one. Also, some of the rooms have exposed pipework running around the walls and ceilings which isn't too attractive The real problem with this place is the noise. On the ground floor of the hotel in the middle is the lobby and on one side is a bar and on the other is a night club. If you get a room near the front then don't plan on getting any sleep until 4 maybe 5 in the morning. The noise is pretty constant and it is VERY noisy with people queuing under the hotel for the club and then falling out of it screaming and shouting. The walls of the rooms are paper thin and there is a lot of noise from corridors and showers being used and toilets flushing elsewhere. The windows in the rooms are very small and all have air con units which allow outside noise in and are nosiy when in operation. I stayed as part of a group and everyone either changed room or complained about the noise.One person had water running down their bathroom wall.

To get to the parking lot you'll have to drive in from the back alley where we saw a prostitute shaving her legs with the puddle of water on the ground. The parking lot is so small there's only one way in, you'll have to back up your car in order to get out. The lobby and reception desk is relatively well docorated and vested with a sweet orange scent but don't let that first look fool you. The only request that we had with our room was for it to be non-smoking, little did we know it also came with a view of three huge power transformers outside of our one and only small window. The fire sprinkle pipes were exposed hanging down from the ceiling. The mattress was such low quality, little weight on one side will tilt the other side up. The bathroom was really small and shower water switches from cold to boiling hot every 5 secs. The shampoo provided doesn't foam up and it smelled just like the strong sweet orange scent from the lobby. My finace and I were only staying there for one night so we were trying to be tolerent and not let it spoil our last day trip in Vancouver. We tried to get rested up to fly out the next day but we were waken at 6am by a strong sufficating cigarette smoke. We checked the hallway and the window but no source of smoke there, it's only in our room that we could smell the smoke. Just when we thought we were being too sensitive, we walked into the bathroom and realized the smoke smell was actually coming down from the exhaust fan! How on earth is that possible?! It was so bad that it filled the bathroom and spilled into the room. We could no longer go back to sleep so we went downstairs to get our complimentary breakfast. We didn't have hopes for anything well, just wanted to get away from our filthy room. The breakfast came with either Tea or Coffee, white or wheat toast, sunny side up eggs or scrambled, and hashbrowns. I ordered tea, wheat toast and scrambled egg, my fiance asked for coffee, white toast and sunny side up. When our tea and coffee came, the obsurdly rude waitress told us and I quote \"You'll have to share the spoon.\" She put down one spoon, turned and left without any explanation.

The music turned off at arouns 5am and we got a few hours sleep. People were also climbing in the fire escape next to our room all night to visit rooms on our floor, they stayed an hour and then left, if you remember the peep shows down the road you can work out what was going on.

My main dislike was the site of the hotel on a part of Granville Street given over to sex shops. Vancouver seems to have a general problem with beggars and substance abusers but they seem to concentrate in that part of town. Towards the end of our three-night stay I was getting a little tired of running a gauntlet of deadbeats to get to get back to the hotel. Locals may take this kind of thing in their stride but for outsiders it can be a little disconcerting. Seeing a spaced out kid in our corridor one evening trying room doors with a card key did not help ease my concerns. Overall the hotel has friendly staff and clean rooms but an in-room safe would have made staying there a little less worrying. It is a budget hotel and pretends to be nothing else and offers decent value for money. Although in a seedy part of town, it is only a couple of minutes walk from much better surroundings.
