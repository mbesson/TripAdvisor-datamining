I stayed across the street at the Grand Hyatt and had a couples massage at the spa in Olive 8. It was amazing! You get a locker and can take a shower with the most awesome shampoo and conditioner I've ever used (it's not on the market yet, I asked). Then you can take a swim in the pool or sit in the hot tub so remember to bring your swim suite. The chairs in the lounging room was relaxing as was the cucumber water. The massage was absolutely perfect and relaxing. I wish I could remember my person's name because she deserves a public compliment. The prices are high, but definitely worth it. I did also eat in the restaurant downstairs. The staff was very friendly. I'm pretty sure my eggs were a little undercooked, but the food was still good. The place has a modern feel, very bright, boxy and modern. It was good for breakfast.

Also, I did not like that the lighting in the entire room was controlled ONLY by the card key placed into the slot near the door. At first I did not think it would be a problem, but there was no way to control the lighting from the bed/bathroom area without the key being in, so that was annoying. Another thing - I did not think the valet parking should have been quite as expensive as it was at 30 something dollars a night - especially considering there were no other options! I know that big city hotels charge these kind of prices, but there are usually alternatives and there wasn't this time. The room was clean - nothing special though. For being one of the only LEED certified buildings in Washington State, it did not have a different ambiance or feeling about it... If it is an eco friendly hotel then why still have the little plastic bottles of shampoo and conditioner? Why not install a unit in the shower like the Hotel Nexus (also in Seattle) has? My room had a couple of small burn holes (maybe from a cigarette?) on the rug near the window. The last thing that I want to comment on was the spa... Nothing about it stands out to me as being awesome, and nothing about it seemed any more eco-friendly than any other spa, I am sorry to say!

Nice room, decent view, fairly quiet, although I would have expected it to be a bit more noise-proof (water running from the next room) given the Hyatt name. Everything was in excellent working order - plumbing, lights, doors, switches, etc. They have energy saving lights and it's a bit annoying to have to insert your room key in the wall switch each time you enter.

We had booked the amour package through the Hyatt website that included breakfast, valet parking, turndown service and champagne & strawberries (it was supposed to include bath salts but given that there was no tub in our room their ommission was not missed). The front desk staff were friendly and professional, and the lobby while small was adequate with 2 different seating areas but there were dirty glasses that sat there unattended for at least 1/2 hour. Our room was an average size and modernly furnished in dark woods and brown, white and teal fabrics. The bed was okay (not as premium as at home but still comfortable) - the downside was no king size pillows only regular size so that was a little difficult to adjust to. The empty fridge was a welcome addition to the room and the 1 cup coffee maker was great (but be aware that it doesn't come with directions so its a little tricky if you aren't familiar with the disks). Water is available in the room for $4 a bottle. There is an ipod docking station on the clock radio - just remember to dim the light or its very bright in the middle of the night. There's a gap under the entrance door that makes noise from the hallway filter in or out as we found out from the neighbours ;) it also allows the light to filter in. the bathroom was quite large with a walk in shower - we had no issue with water pressure but it did take a while for it to warm up each time we used it. Only one robe in the room was strange and only 2 bath towels which was fine since we had turndown service but not so great if you didn't. We ate at Urbane and the food was good, the coffee was probably prepared with a french press since we both landed up with grounds in the bottom of our cups but the service was barely acceptable...in 45 minutes we were offered one cup of coffee and when I requested a refill in a clean cup it took a while to come and we never got asked again. We had ordered extra bacon and had a separate bill for that which we left $15 for to include a tip ($5.50 for the bacon, $9.50 for a tip) but when we checked out the waitress had charged it to the room even after I had said that the cash was for tip & extra bacon - the front desk removed the charge but it was very frustrating after the lack of service to then have to deal with this. I didn't like the view from the restaurant... all of the hotels smokers gathering on the corner for a few puffs followed by the requests from the bus stop patrons for cigarettes from the smokers...not very appetizing The pool looked nice and was empty at 11 am when we checked it out but we didn't use it. One last thing that was undoubtedly an isolated thing but there were several drops of blood on the elevator floor when we went down for breakfast and when we used the same elevator to check out at closer to 2 they were still there. We used the conceige for our dinner reservations and he suggested Ivar's rather than Elliots. I'm not sure it was the best location for our anniversary dinner given the number of people in shorts and beach coverups or the large number of families but the salmon was excellent.

I've never had to wait more than a minute to get checked in at this hotel, and this time was the same. We were given a corner room with two queen beds, the extra space being appreciated since we were traveling with our children. The room itself was great with a view out the front towards the Paramount Theatre, but the windows along the side of the building looked into the office building right beside. We generally just kept those drapes closed, but the kids did have some fun pointing out people who were on u-tube during work hours. There's two things that make this THE hotel for me when I'm in Seattle. One is the location, as it's a very short walk to pretty much anywhere from here. The other is their restaurant Urbane. This is one of the best places for breakfast that I've found, and while I'd usually prefer to sleep over getting up for breakfast, I never miss a chance to have the Seattle Omelet here.

It is very much centrally located, which made it easy to walk everywhere- Belltown, Pioneeer Square, Pike Place, etc. I do have to say that while I prefer the rooms at the Grand Hyatt, the rooms here are also amazing. The room we got may have been smaller than the one we got at the Grand, but everything is still top-notch. Everything - furniture, fixtures, fittings, electronics, etc - is very clean and modern; the bathroom is nice and spacious (although smaller than the one at the Grand and only had a shower/tub combo); and the bed is heavenly comfortable. I will say, though, that the staff here seemed a lot friendlier and accommodating than those at the Grand (I never thought the service could be surpassed there, but I guess I was wrong). Despite the fact that we made our booking through Priceline, our riff-raff status did not seem to matter to the staff because we were treated so very well and were made to feel truly welcome and appreciated as guests. The service provided by everyone - from front desk to housekeeping to the bar staff - was just impeccable. Just to niggle at a couple of things because that is what I do: in-room wifi is not free, which bugs me in this day and age, and parking is expensive ($38, valet only, but on par with what is offered in the area, and one can always self-park at the 7th and Pike Garage for $30/24 hours).

My only issues: A cooler they called a refrigerator didn't work and our food spoiled but they sent up milk at no cost for cereal we brought. The parking was ridiculously overpriced, about $40.00 per day, the lot across the street was $25.00. They make you pay for internet which I find absurd. At these rates it should be complimentary like most hotels. Even low end hotels offer free wifi, no excuse they make you pay other then another way to gouge the guest for that extra buck. Last complaint was the salt water pool which was heated to 80' was cold. Only little kids were in and we lasted about 5 minutes, it was way to cold.

Also great fitness centre. The service however leaves much to be desired. I booked this hotel on a discount website for a weekend, paying half rack rate. The staff were unenthusiatic and the checkin experience alone gave me the impression the Hyatt was more interested in trying to extract every dime from me than providing helpful service. Checking in at 4, I was told me room was not ready but for only another $25 a night I could have an allegry friendly room (which just has an air filter in it) or leave and come back later. I came back an hour back later, and was given the same room that they had tried to upsell me before. If my booked class of room is not available, most other hotels give a free upgrade instead of trying to upsell you or make you wander the city for an hour. The parking is horrendously expensive,$41 per day for valet ($50 with taxes and tips) and when I asked about cheaper options I was told that there was a self park a block away for $28 /day but nothing else and that it would likely end up cheaper to use the valet service. Fortunately a local tipped me off that street parking from 6 pm Sat to 8 am Monday is free in Seattle. It was dissapointing that I specifically asked about cheaper parking and was not told about free street parking on the weekend, closer to the hotel than the safe park. Between the room \"upgrade\" which they tried to get me to buy and didn't, and pushing me to use valet service and not telling about the free street parking, in my first few minutes they tried to get me to spend another $150, close to the cost of my 2 night booking. There was no effort on the part of staff to explain the ammenties or help me with my luggage and generally more interested in talking to themselves than providing prompt service. The comparable hotel chain that I normally stay at gives me free parking, free internet, free bottled water, free upgrades when rooms aren't availble. The Hyatt: $4 bottles of water, $15 internet charges, no paper. Maybe upselling and not telling guests about free parking are part of the corporate culture or maybe I got second rate service because I used a vocher from a discount website.

It's clean, beautifully decorated and the location and service is absolutely top notch. The hotel's best available rates can be slightly pricey but there's good deals to be had if you watch their promotions carefully. I always take up on the eStandby offer of a 60 minute massage at the Elaia Spa for $79. The massage is other-worldly and the spa facilities -- including his-and-hers private steam room and sauna in change rooms, an indoor salt water pool and a large hot tub, which are available to hotel guests as well -- are well-maintained and provide a welcome respite to the cold, rainy Seattle winter days. Granted, sometimes the pool can be a bit rowdy with kids splashing around, but catching it at the right time, you could have one of the most peaceful, relaxing time at this pool. I have found staff at both the hotel and at the spa to be extremely courteous, warm and professional, which further enhances the infrastructure of the hotel, which, incidentally, is LEED certified -- you'd never notice the difference in terms of comfort as I've had some of my best sleeps here. A couple of features at Olive 8 that subtly signals to me that the hotel management actually thinks about and cares about what travellers actually want: - there is a fridge -- not a mini-bar, but a fridge -- in each room. - there is an A/V input panel on the work desk that is integrated into the large flat screen TV, including PC, component and HDMI input -- enabling you to play your own music, movies or presentations in the room and the integration is seamless. The hotel also has a 24hr fitness center with great equipment. My only quib is that the lighting is very low and with dark floor, it's sometimes hard to see -- not a good combination when you're lifting weights.

The king room was spacious and clean, and we had a nice view of the green roof and the theatre nearby. The bathroom was the cleanest I've ever been in. The spa was a great experience. We got a couples massage and were treated very well by the staff. I've read other reviews that said the walls were thin. We didn't have any problems with noise, but we were in a corner unit, and there may not have been a lot of people on our floor, so I can't really vouch either way. We had breakfast at Urbana one day, and the food was very good, but pricey. I tend to stay away from hotel restaurants, but we were being lazy that morning. To be nitpicky, my only issue was the $10 Internet charge. Hotels need to get into the 21st century mindset that it should be complimentary to all.

Beautiful corner location with rows and rows of windows, bringing in lots of natural light. Nice flat-screen TV and clean-as-a-whistle bathroom. Some trouble with noise from our next-door neighbors, but that's to be expected. We had trouble with the room temperature, which got very cold and very hot when you turned the fan on, but somehow couldn't get \"just right.\" Maybe a quirk of the \"green\" certification? Service was prompt and extremely friendly, and when I called down for extra shampoo it came within a half hour. I was also impressed by the call to the room from the gal who checked me in, just to make sure we had everything. Our room was on the 4th floor, so the view wasn't as sweeping as advertised on the corporate website. If you are paying full price and want a view, request a high floor. Valet parking was a breeze, and, sadly, $39 is the norm for downtown Seattle. I've waited for my car for a half hour at other hotels on Sunday check-outs, but they had my car within 2 minutes.

This is an excellent hotel. Minimalistic lobby, in a hip, eco-conscious sort of way. The staff here are excellent. It is probably the best service I have ever experienced. I am sensitive to chemicals from work-related chemical exposures, and the WA Toxic Coalition recommended this hotel, saying it is one of 3 hotels in the Pacific NW that is eco-friendly. From the minute I called, to the minute I checked out, and then afterwards, dealing with billing mishaps, the staff were superb. I saw one website that this hotel only used non-chemical cleaners in their rooms. When I double checked, the front desk person checked with the housekeeping staff, and unfortunately they did use regular cleaning products; but when I asked if the room could be prepared in a special way, they happily said that it could. I prefer to book reservations on-line. (I.e. no mishaps in name, billing address, etc. plus, I get a chance to pick the room. And now, since becoming sensitive to cleaning products, I could type in comments with the way I could ask the room to be prepared.) After I made the reservation, I called the hotel back and the front desk person also made a special note about how the room would be prepared. I have literally never received such excellent service as I did from this hotel, except at the Nile Cairo; but even so, this hotel exceeded that one in service, and just about everything else, for that matter. At any rate, my mom and I showed up, and just to make sure, we inquired if the room was indeed prepared the way we asked. (It is a pain being sensitive to chemicals, which I only just acquired recently, but I so appreciated this hotel in accommodating me with this.) The front desk clerk checked with housekeeping, and then double checked with the manager. I couldn't believe the service we received. She said the room had not been shampooed and the sheets had been washed in baking soda, and I believe the bathroom was cleaned the same way, as I had asked. Again, the service was outstanding. You would think that you would only get this type of service if you were the president or staying at a $400-$500 room or something. And, they did so, so happily, like they were really happy to see you, and serve you. Amazing. I've never really received service like that before. Thus, we go up to the room and it was lovely. Very cool and hip furnishings. Big, flat screen TV. We might sound like \"hicks,\" ha, ha, but we've never watched TV on an HDTV before. Of course friends have told us about it. And, we must be behind the times, as we laughed and giggled at the quality of it. We were watching something on the Discovery channel, underwater something or another, and we honestly couldn't tell if it was a cartoon or not! It was that good. The rest of the room had excellent quality everything. There were two comfortable queen beds. Lovely crisp white cotton duvets with pretty bedspreads folded at the bottom of the bed. I believe down pillows. A hip cool chair with an end table. Picture windows with nice views of downtown Seattle. I wished the windows would have opened, but they didn't. They did, it seemed, have some sort of fresh air that came in through the vents, though. The bathroom was nice. Like what you would see on the House Hunters show. Very hip and cool, too. One of those sliding opaque, semi-see-through doors. Marble, I believe, floors, and vanity with the sink. A low flow toilet, which went along with the eco-minded theme of the hotel. A large tub, which I wished I could have soaked in, but in the interest of time, I didn't. The hair dryer was very nice. High powered, but not very loud. A rubber handle, which felt nice on the hands. A very nice, one-pot coffee pot. I wish I could have bought the hairdryer and coffee pot from the Hyatt catalog. The rooom was so nice and we were only there one night, it was like, \"what to do? what to do? Soak in the tub, eat room service, watch the nice TV, or go to the spa?\" which by the way was nice, too. They had a steam room and a sauna, with their nice thick Hyatt towels and bathrobes. I skipped the sauna and we ate room service, twice. Equally excellent. Very nice quality. Nice wait staff. The prices were excellent. We're used to paying, I guess high prices up here. We don't really think they are high. We're just used to it, then getting semi-mediocore food. But when you go down to the lower 48, or in particular this hotel, and get the food you do, for the prices quoted, you're impressed. (However, I was just in upstate NY, MD, PA, and Pasadena, CA in April and May, and got sort of high priced food that was mediocore, so this hotel really stood out.) The food came and we were \"wowed.\" The servers brought it on a lovely pewter tray, with lovely heavy silverware and pewter salt and pepper shakers. We had the open faced steak sandwich and fish and chips for dinner. Excellent. For breakfast we had the eggs benedict and the florentine scramble. Very good waitstaff and food. It was a little weird, though, when the food arrived for breakfast the waiter said, \"no toast, just as you ordered,\" which I didn't say \"no toast\" on the phone, which was strange, but no matter. We split all the meals to enjoy all of it. The location is excellent. The first night we walked a block too far and turned back to the hotel. The next day, before checking out, we used their directions and the map they gave us, which was to take a left at the lobby and a left at the first street, and walk 7 blocks. It seemed like we walked uphill and downhill both ways! We laughed as we thought this was kind of funny. It seemed a bit like San Francisco. It was really close and an enjoyable walk. What else? Oh yeah, the strange billing mishaps. When we went to check out the bill was more than I thought. I was there on business and was getting reimbursed for the room, so I thought maybe they didn't give me the business rate. When I asked and checked the bill, I did get the business rate. So when I asked again about the bill, the front desk gal said it was just for some \"miscelaneous phone charges.\" We had taken a taxi service 4 times in basically one day, or less than 24 hours, from the time we arrived, so the nice taxi cab driver was waiting outside for us again. I didn't want to make him wait again, as he had already waited for awhile before an appointment that morning. At any rate, I just took the bill and left and got in the taxi cab to the airport. When I looked over the bill, I called the hotel immediately. There were 64 phone charges! Very strange. They were all to the same number, which wasn't even a correct 10 digit number. The calls started at 6:02 am, the time I called for breakfast, and ended up 6:34 AM, to the same number, some calling the same minute, like 6:02, 6:02, 6:03, 6:04, 6:04. My mom was in the shower and then we were eating breakfast, and then we went by taxi cab to our appointment. I spoke to a Steven, at the front desk, and he thought it was very strange, too. My mom and I laughed, as it looked like I was \"stalker\" or a \"harrasser\" or something, calling somebody that many times, which I wasn't calling anybody! Anyway, Steven said he would take care of it, correct it, and e-mail me the bill, so that I could present it for reimbursement to my employer. I got back to Kodiak and checked my e-mail and the bill did not come through. I called and the front desk person remembered me and said Steven was helping me. They put me through to accounting and that person e-mailed me the correct version of the bill. However, the original high charge was still charged to my credit card. Then there was a mysterious $8.00 charge, on top of the incorrect high charge. Very strange. The only thing I could think of was that either the dinner or breakfast person was triple of double tipped. (It's no big deal, but I accidently double tipped the dinner person as a 20% service charge is added to the bill, and I tipped on top of it. No big deal. For breakfast, I saw the 20% tip was already added, so I didn't add anything additionally.) $8.00 is no big deal, but it was just strange, and I thought after the goofy phone charges, it was just another strange billing deal. I e-mailed the accounting person again, a bit embarressed about a measly $8.00 charge, but again, after the over $64.00 in phone charges, it just seemed strange to keep getting weird charges on my credit card. Plus, I thought the food was great, but a double or a triple tip was a bit excessive. I just checked my credit card and now instead of an $8.00 credit, I now have an over $19.00 credit! Very odd. Oh well. Despite these odd billing practices, which I, and the front desk Steven, (in regards to the strange phone calls,) couldn't figure out, this was a most excellent hotel and I would highly recommend it. In fact, I have already recommended it to 3 people who were flying to Seattle this month, and their spouses. I also recommended it to someone who could put the word out about ecologically friendly hotels for other people consciencious about this on a website. Again, the billing was very strange, but the food, service, staff, location, quality of the rooms, furnishings, linens, and price made up for this. Again, I would highly recommend it and I will stay here in the future. In fact, this may be the only hotel I will ever stay in if I go to the Seattle area again. One thing, however, is the only thing this hotel didn't have was an airport shuttle, which I don't know if this is ubiqutious for Seattle hotels or not? No matter, as we used a taxi. When I called to inquire, after booking, they said there is an airporter shuttle that goes to the downtown area, I think dropping off at a hotel near there, for $15 per person. They also mentioned a metro? for a couple of dollars, leaving the airport, right near there as well. Well, you can't go wrong with this hotel. There is no need to eat anywhere else either. Literally, you won't be dissatisfied. Oh, and by the way, the gov't rate was $159. An excellent deal for such a high quality hotel, in a great location, with excellent staff and high quality rooms. All in all, two thumbs up. Highly recommended. My mom and I still talk about the food, the TV, and those pewter serving trays and salt and pepper shakers! I wish they would have sold it in their Hyatt catalog. Good job Hyatt. I looking forward to going back if I ever have to stay in Seattle again.", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cElegant & Environmentally Conscious\u201d", "Author": "honu024", "ReviewID": "UR84355633", "Content": "The excellent service started with a phone call to the hotel during which I was given several options for traveling from the airport to Hyatt at Olive 8.

I think this is really stupid. A lot of hotels are moving away from this and I think it goes a LONG way to offer free internet. The other negative was the doors on the bathroom.

The tour company picked me up at the hotel. Urbane was a very good restaurant. The food was fresh and delicious. The only glitch we had was the fire alarm went off one night.

THE ROOM... We originally had booked a regular room but upon check in we were warmly welcomed and informed that we had been upgraded to a corner suite. It was a beautiful room with floor to ceiling windows that looked out to the Paramount Theater. The room was incredibly beautiful! ROOM SERVICE...(big kudos) We decided to get room service that night to enjoy our anniversary evening in a private setting and after placing our order we were informed that we would be receiving a 20% discount on any room service orders during our stay. The food came even earlier than expected and was delicious. The gentleman who delivered our food even offered to open and pour our own bottle of wine at no additional cost...not a common practice in other hotels we've stayed in. OVERALL... Long story short is you absolutely cannot go wrong if you decide to stay at the Hyatt Olive 8...truly one of the best experiences we've ever had.

The Hyatt at Olive 8 is an amazing facility and I highly recommend staying here. The hotel website tells you a lot about the design, environmental impact and luxury of this facility, however there is plenty that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you. The staff at the hotel are beyond helpful, friendly and dare I say genuinely interested in making sure you have everything you need. I had key problems at my room door (my fault \u00e2\u20ac\u201c don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep your room key in your pocked in the hot tub) and they sent someone up to get me in my room within minutes. The room is gorgeous. The king bed was super comfortable, the pillows were perfect and I think I need to buy some for my place. My room had a 37\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd LG LCD TV. Most network and basic cable stations came in fine however I was having with the ESPN channels. At the side of the bed was an iHome AM/FM iPod dock which was great for my iPhone to charge each night. The room also had a small refrigerator and mini bar area. The bathroom was interesting with a big sliding door which was different. The shower was a stand up shower, glass half enclosure with a stone floor. I like hot showers, it was with delight that I saw the mirror after the shower. The middle section of the mirror did not fog up, the rest did. It was clearly a rectangle and meant to happen. It was great. The fitness and pool facilities are very well designed and luxurious. The pool is a good temperature and slightly salted. Around the pool are lounge chairs which are always stocked with fresh towels. The pool is open at 5:30 am so I was able to turn some laps before the conference each day. The locker room has a steam room, sauna, showers, lockers and basic essentials like razors, combs, shaving cream, after shave\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 etc. There are also water coolers in the gym and locker room. There is also a full spa with massages and treatments for extra, I did not partake in any of that. The cons: I feel that a place as expensive at the Hyatt at Olive 8 shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nickel and dime\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd you for certain things. It is 2010, wi-fi should be included in the cost of a room by now. I found the $10 internet fee per each 24 hours to be offensive. Also there were bottles of Aquafina in the room, but they were $4 each! I get free wi-fi and water at a Holiday Inn Express I should certainly get it in a luxurious place like this. That said, I highly recommend this hotel. I had friends at places nearby the convention center with similar cost and a much lesser hotel. This place is incredible and should be considered highly for your Seattle downtown needs.

A \"cooler\" (mini fridge but not quite as cold) was in the room, which was nice to use for leftovers. We also liked our daily newspaper.

The Pacific Northwest is one of the wettest, rainiest, and most verdant places in the country, and suffers from no shortage of water. \"Green\" also means the elevators are very slow. You can wait a long time for one and the slow ride suggests a lack of sense of urgency. Not business friendly. On the plus side, the rooms (especially the luxury suites) were very clean and spacious. Diamond breakfast amenity is a free entree and a free drink (juice OR coffee - not both) and you need to present a voucher that the front desk might or might not remember to give you. Beds very comfortable and room was mostly quiet, except for one day when I could hear conversation through the airvent from the room above (or below) mine. The valet service is very good. My car was always available when I called in advance for it. There is street parking in the blocks around the hotel (mostly west and north), but that part of the Seattle gets a bit sketchy and parking rules are a bit arcane, so I wouldn't recommend it for a first-time visitor. There is also a pay lot across the street that seems slightly cheaper than the valet.

He just told me to tell the restaurant that it was included in our rate. Then when we arrived there in the morning we asked the person greeting us the same question and she told us to ask our server. Our server then told us it was only a main course per adult that was included and that the children's meals would come on a separate bill, even though we said we had a family package. We ordered and she left. When we got the bill we asked again, as we were pretty sure the kid's meals were supposed to be included as well. She then tried to call the reception, but couldn't get hold of them, and told us to solve it at check-out. When we got back to our room we checked our reservation form, which said breakfast from the kid's menu was included up to four children.

They also have a water extractor machine to dry your bathing suit! Very nice changing area. We did eat breakfast at their restuarant and food was very good, and served with a nice presentation.

We were given our keys and truck when it was brought up and when getting in it was noticed right away. The wall (stucco/cement/paint) was still very visible and there was no way you could have not realized you did it and the mirror itself was hanging out!.

No one from the hotel made a move to see what the problem was, when I went in to take a child to the restroom - I mentioned it to the front desk and they seemed unmoved. In the end we did get a check to cover the exact amount of damages after providing then with 2 estimates from 2 different repair shops. 2) Spa staff gave my husband his receipt for the services that I had arranged to be billed to our room and asked NOT to provide him with any receipt or bill!

Unfortunately, the way we departed left a bad taste in our mouth. Upon arrival, we discovered valet parking was $39/night. Ouch. We were told to park at the other Hyatt across the street. We were later disappointed to learn that none of this was subsidized by the hotel, unlike our previous night in Bellevue. The hotel lobby is clean and modern. It could use some warmth, but was very clean and bright. Me and our friends have Platinum status with Hyatt. Unfortunately, this was not recognized by the hotel until we informed them at check-out. The staff was initially friendly and appeared to enjoy working there. The rooms are nice and spacious. We had a room on an higher floor, away from the street. The rooms were generally quiet, save for the occasional slamming of the doors in the hall. The rooms are \"green\" friendly, meaning a key is needed to operate the lights. The bathroom lighting is very good and ambient. The showers are \"low flow\", which is fine by me, but you couldn't adjust the hot shower water spray to be wider. The Spa was very nice. The staff were very professional, friendly and well trained. The pool was salt water and was quite suited for doing laps. When the sun came out, the light lit up the room brilliantly and was beautiful to be in. I would recommend the concierge. There was a convention in town, and he made a reservation for a local restaurant. It cut our wait time in half. Relaxed and exhausted by several hours at the Spa and a night out in Seattle, we were looking forward to a good night's rest. Unfortunately, we got the short straw in our room choice. We could never get the room temperature to be right at night, despite you being able to set the temperature. It was either too warm or too cold and it was not enjoyable getting up in the night to change it. Around 7:00am, we were rudely awoken by a loud beeping. We tried to ignore it at first, thinking it would go away. It didn't. Apparently, the fire alarm's batteries hadn't been changed in a while. We informed the front desk. It took 15 minutes of loud beeping until someone came to change the batteries. By that time, it was impossible not to be annoyed by 20 minutes of fire alarm noise (it was an alarm after all). The alarms were right above the bed, so we had to get out of bed and get changed. A loud alarm and a stranger in your room while you are groggy and frustrated - a pleasant start to the day! So much for sleeping in, which is one reason we chose to stay at the hotel, rather than somewhere more hectic. When we checked out, the front desk did not apologize or was not even aware of the issue, until we mentioned it off hand. After learning of this, they were unconcerned about us. There was an apology, but it was issued with insincere and out of reflex. I felt like they couldn't have cared less. The onus was also on us to correct our bill. Coffee and pastries was included with our \"Earth Day\" package. But they charged us, and the onus was on us to try to get it off. Ditto with our internet, which is supposed to be free for Platinum members. It was up to us to make them correct it, which is never enjoyable. And as I said earlier, they didn't even recognize our Hyatt Gold Passport status - Platinum - until check out. I have felt like I have had better experiences being a general member with IHG hotels. (Lest anyone think we are snobby about our status, we are not. We spent time in Starwood hotels frequently, but had signed up for a trial Platinum membership to see what Hyatt had to offer. After this, I am not sure what incentive there is to trying to get it).

The decor is elegant and calm. The room was spacious and well-appointed. I particularly like the oversized sliding wood-and-frosted-glass doors on the closet and the shower, which give the room a more upscale feel compared to regular doors. The glass-walled walk-in shower was a nice plus, though I personally would have designed it with dual shower heads. The bed was comfortable and the wireless Internet service, while not free, was fast and reliable. Service at the hotel was excellent. Wake up calls are made by humans rather than machines and come with an optional 10-minute followup call. One morning I accidentally left the phone off the hook after the first call, and the hotel sent someone to knock on my door and make sure I was awake. Now that's customer service. The gym is spotless and outfitted with plenty of quality equipment including treadmills, ellipticals, stationary bikes, and a complete set of weight stations. The pieces of aerobic equipment all have individual television screens, of course. The Hyatt hotels with condos attached are often known for the quality of their gyms, and this one is no exception. If it just had the stunning view of the fitness center at the Sheraton, it would be perfect. But it was close enough. For swimmers there's a 65 foot saline lap pool, which was a real treat and something I haven't found at any other downtown property. And there's a complete day spa on the property, which I did not get to sample this trip. Breakfast at the Urbane was good (my waiter the first morning spoiled me by bringing steamed milk for the coffee), though I'd still trek over to Toulouse Petite on Queen Anne for their pain perdu if I had time. The only thing that marred my stay at the Hyatt at Olive 8 was a very loud bunch of kids partying in the room next door until the wee hours of the morning.

Wifi did not work well with my mac - the desk guy said the same thing about his mac. Had to switch to wired ethernet which was fine. Around $10/day. Had to ask to have wifi charge removed because they double billed me for internet. They fixed it without a fuss. Tmobile is the wifi carrier and they seem to have a problem with macintosh hardware in general. Room was reasonably quiet given the city environs. Windows not operable. Room still has a bit of the new carpet smell from the construction but not overpowering. Room service was fine. Parking is expensive around $36/day with tax for valet. Service however was excellent. Staff was very helpful. Hyatt uses overly smelly hair/soap products in room - did not like. However the locker rooms for the pool/gym have better products which I took back to my room in the little cups they had out for the mouthwash. In room coffee is lame - Hyatt should switch to whatever Hilton is using because it is better stuff. Did not even have real milk/creamer for coffee just powder. This is not the best western so they could do a little better with that. No coffee shop in hotel but there is a starbucks at the hyatt grand and other places nearby.

Both were absolutely amazing! We had our room at the Hyatt at Olive 8 for five nights, and it became our home away from home. It was a great way to be introduced to a city that fast became a must-return destination. Some highlights: - They upgraded us to a corner room (I was celebrating my birthday, and that was such a nice treat!) - The location is convenient to everything, even a Whole Foods grocery a few blocks in the opposite direction from Pike Place - The styling is modern and sleek - We had a roomy, EMPTY mini-fridge! We LOVE the empty fridge and are not minibar people, so this is a huge plus, especially when walking back and forth from Pike Place all the time with yummy snacks. - The fog-free mirror was cool, just one of those little touches that remind you you're not at home The only downsides, none of which was a big deal for us but could be for someone else: - Our wireless Internet didn't work -- they did provide us with a wired connection, though - We only had one robe in the room (huh?) - The sliding door on the bathroom would be inappropriate for anyone sharing a room who was not very familiar with their roommate - There's no tub, so don't bring bubble bath.

Location was fine and intitial impression is good but the staff was incompetent on top of having a strange facility to work in. Part of the hotel floors are full time condos and the rest are normal hotel rooms. I'm not sure which were first but this hotel has the SLOWEST elevators known to mankind and the mixed use may be the reason. This was the NOISIEST Hotel we have EVER stayed in without exception. The design of the hotel puts the rooms in a culdesac arrangement that allows you to hear even normal conversation in the rooms around you. Every time someone closes their entry door in the rooms around you it sounds like your room door closing. The worst part of this stay is that they put us on a floor with what appeared to be a bachlorette party (no guys) that reserved most of the floor, even though we asked for a quiet room at check in. The noise started at 11pm, security came up and asked them to be quiet, no better. We could hear every word while the drunk girls are angrily asking who is complaining. The second time they asked the girls to leave to party and it was quiet for a couple of hours. At 3 am, after hearing a fight conversation because the girls ran out of beer, I called the desk and asked to be put on a different floor first thing in the morning. They agreed to do so. 5 minutes later a \"Security\" person knocks on our door to hand me a key while the drunk girls are looking at our door saying \"That's the room that turned us in\" , unbelievable. The next morning I went down to get a luggage cart to move to the new room (we had 2 weeks worth of stuff on our way to Victoria BC for vacation) and was told I could only use a bellman and was refused the use of a cart. I had all I could take of the staff at that point and moved the bags in two trips with my wife. The second day in the new room, staring at the office workers in the next building, was ok except for the slamming doors and hearing the couple next door make their breakfast plans for the morning. Non noise issue, all of the pillows are the same, firm. So, if you're planning a bachelor or bachlorette party, grad or prom party this is a great choice.

They didn't know which cheeses or meats were which and it took them like 15 minutes to slice cheese and cured meat.

The hotel was everything I was expecting from a Hyatt - clean rooms and amenities, great service in all areas, great location...everything that really mattered was great. The pool was awesome, Olympic style and great for professional swimmers - I wish I were one to really enjoy that pool. The Jacuzzi was also great, very big. The best thing is that usually there is no one in the pool area - mostly 5 people. I really have nothing negative to say except that I personally didn't like the food at the Urbane restaurant but I am a very picky eater so it doesn't mean the food was bad. Happy hour was great - the food was really cheap. One comment on the bathroom door - I was with my wife so it didn't really matter to me but if I was with anyone else I wouldn't be comfortable using the restroom/shower since the door doesn't lock, it just slides in without attaching with anything. I tried looking inside while the door was all the way shut and you could see the inside so it's really something to look into.... again if you are traveling with your spouse it's not an issue. There is no real great view from this hotel but it's nothing that can be changed. We had a high floor but we only saw buildings, nothing else. Also, I wish since this is a green hotel there was a green area for guests (small grassy area or patio style place). There was really nowhere to hang out in the hotel if you wanted to come out of the room, the lobby is kind of small and has no private places to sit down and relax.

Beyond the fact that we chose this hotel for the pool and spa and upon arrival were told they were out of service, Hyatt robbed me and my wife of more than $2,000 during our three night stay, making our vacation utterly useless... After negotiating a refund for our final night's stay due to the lack of amenities described on their website, we patiently awaited the credit to our account (in addition to a $400 credit we were supposed to receive from gift certificates we presented at the front desk). None of these credits showed up, and the next morning, we were charged three times the full amount of our three night stay! Although Hyatt had deposited our gift certificates, they never bothered to give us the credit! Management apologized (not adequately, FYI) but gave no clear explanation of why this happened. After speaking to my bank, the manager (name of JP) promptly left for four days to go on vacation, leaving us with his trusty Assistant, Claudia. Claudia continuously apologized, but was unable to change the fact that all three of our bank accounts were down to ZERO (one of them was in the red), because of their \"mistake\" (I am being generous calling it a mistake, as since then several things have happened to lead me to believe this might have been malicious). Claudia then told us to have drinks on the house. We asked if two friends could join us and she agreed. Our last night we spent drinking with a couple friends, trying to enjoy ourselves since we had been stuck in the hotel for three days with NO MONEY. The next morning Claudia informed us that our charges were unjust and she didn't think they should have to pay for it (total for four of us was $200 + tip - average drink cost at their pricey bar was $16! - that averages two drinks per person). Unjust? I think not! After arguing with her, she agreed to cover it. I told her I wanted a receipt and she informed me that I did not need one. Of course, when we returned home I found that they had indeed charged my debit card for the full amount, even before they had fully refunded our $2,000!!!! I am still awaiting a resolution for this problem. Hotel management has now decided to tell me that they are standing by the charges - basically admitting that Claudia lied to us, but being perfectly okay with that. They have the upper hand, because we gave them our credit card number - apparently if you have someone's credit card number you can charge them to the end of the Earth!

The hotel is well situated in the center of town and easy to find. They have chilled towels which is an added bonus. There is a bit of hall noise that makes its way into the rooms. I always anticipate this and bring a fan for white noise. Curiously, when I was leaving the hotel, the concierge told me I didn't need to bring that as they have fans if the guest requests one.

The hotel is very clean and new. The \"green\" concept is cool. You have to use your room key in the room to active the lights. I was told this was to conserve energy. The lobby area seems very cold. It's almost as if they are lacking some furniture or something. The walls are very thin at this hotel. You could hear the maids cleaning in the room next door and every time your neighbor slams the door you are sure to here it too. The water pressure in the shower is just okay. They installed a low water pressure shower head to conserve water. I didn't like the fact that if you didn't call the front desk and ask them to change out your towels they would leave your dirty towels in your room wherever you left them. I am okay with not having the bed linens changed daily, but the shower towels is another thing. They have a half glass wall in the shower so you are cold the entire time you are in there. The half glass wall looks cool, but it is not practical. The water splashes out to the bathroom floor which ends up making a mess. Bring your own shampoo, conditioner and body lotion if you are used to using higher end products. The hotel will pride you with very generic stuff. The location of the hotel is excellent and the staff is very nice. The Spa is not open yet. I was disappointed that the pool was closed. They do have an awesome gym and the equipment was outstanding.

Once I brought this up to the attention of the front desk representative they apologized and said that she had to manually put the promotion in to the system.

The roof is the largest green roof in Seattle where they'll be growing herbs and spices for the restaurant (I got a full rundown from the bartender).
