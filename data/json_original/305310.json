{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not for tourists!!! I'm writing this review in English (even if I'm Italian) because I want to give some information to tourists thinking to go to this Hotel.So... why are you going to sleep in this Hotel? I'm just asking.. if you are in Florence for business, maybe this hotel can be ok for you.. it is in a industrial area, not really well connected with the nearby Highway (but not difficult to be reached from there), plenty of logistic warehouses and factories. Roads are going to be renewed, anyway.But if you are a tourist... well.. probably this is not the hotel for you.. I saw two Chinese buses stopping there for the night.. but it was just for the night!!! If you are tired, on the Highway, going in/out from Florence, maybe you can stop there to sleep.. but do not think to use this location for a two/three holidays day.. at the same price, you can find a lot of family owned hotel in a better touristic location..  Now, some Plus and Minus:PLUSPrice: good priced in winter (when it is empty).. you can have a good bargain sleeping thereRoom dimensions: they were ok.. not too big but not too small, with a good and clean bathroom.Parking: a private, free and safe parking is available.. this is a big point since I'd not park my car in that area..MINUSLocation: well, it is not just an industrial area, but it is full of street working girls in the night. It can be scary if you are not used at that.. But, please note, NONE of the girls ever enters the hotel..Breakfast: mhhh.. I hoped for a nice one.. but it was poor, nothing special, low quality food..Noise: since some room are facing Loading Bays, you can be waken up by trucks in the early morning..IMHO, at the end, you should consider this hotel just as a rest in your tourist trip, or for a business stop in your working trip.It does not worth anything else..", "Date": "Apr 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR141019839", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Skiman"}, {"Content": "In the midlle of lala land If you want to be in Tuscany find another hotel. This is a place for people with cars coming in Italy for business and even in this case it is a very bad hotel. Near Autostrada del Sole but without direct contact. You have to go round a lot to reach the the highway. It is an industrial area. Room are clean but they try to make small cost reductions not suppling enough soap. Staff I have thought is stupid or make stupid. They have asked me three times if I leave. One night the magnetic key has been deactivated. They cannot organize shuttel transport vithout messing other activities. The only persons sober enough to discuss with you are one driver and one bellboy. You cannot ask the reception any information because they cannot (want not) help you. The region is well known for prostitution and the only contact with Florence, if you don't have a car, is a bus at about 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. All area is under construction and is not very easy to walk.Conclusion try to find another hotel.", "Date": "Oct 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR911070462", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "maghi"}, {"Content": "Don't go here! Stayed here due to a booking with a tour company. It is in the middle of an industrial estate which is only partially built - the pavements are only partially made too - so dangerous to walk on - the rooms are large but double means two singles pushed together - the wardrobe enabled us to hang up only 2 jackets and 2 shirts and have two tiny drawers also. Around 25 minutes from Florence by taxi - 40 euros. On a bus and train route but trecherous to get to after 15 minutes walk along edge of the road. Hotel restaurant diabolical - breakfast on Saturday 3rd June - scrambled eggs were green! We've both come back with terrible rashes which appeared after our first night in the hotel bed. Shower door broken and packing tape covering up stuff in the bathroom. Bureau badly scorched. Safe could be picked up and carried around - all in all unless you are absolutely desperate do not stay here! Staff not exceptionally interested in anything or anyone. Also - nowhere else to eat that we could find within 1.5 hours walking time.", "Date": "Jun 7, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR845999320", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "EvaG"}, {"Content": "No Aircon until 1st May?! We have just come back from a long weekend at this hotel. Here are a few pointers: - NO airconditioning in the rooms until 1st of May, Have no reason why, just because. According to reception staff - we dont need it until then. The rooms were hot and when we opened the windows, you are faced with a very very busy roundabout directly in front of the hotel.-this hotel is in an industrial estate and as such, it is not the most easy of places to walk around.-The nearest train station is a 10 min walk away - Pratignone - once we figured this out we were ok getting to and from Florence and Prato.- some of the reception staff are very UNHELPFUL. Be warned - some people that work there will not give out information even if you beg for it - only on the third day were we given a map of the local area and information about the local buses etc. -That said, they do offer a shuttle into Florence every morning at 9am but only for 6 people. They did put on another one at 10am for us because we insisted on some solution.- Breakfast consists of a few pastries and cereals - they put on bigger breakfasts for the two tour groups that stayed one night each. Again, the staff were not the most helpful - never enough cultery/cups etc and half the time was spent trying to find a spoon or some milk- The taxi fares to get into Prato (about 15 mins away) came to about 23euros - manic drivers but certainly easy way to get around. The train is just as good and takes about the same amount of time for 1.70euros.-Ask the taxi drivers to recommend resturants in the little town behind the hotel (calenzano) - we found a very nice local (read cheap homemade genuine italian food) resturant based on a taxi drivers recommendation. there is also a supermarket in Carrefour (shopping centre just beyond the station and a few shoe shops.-There is a biggish shopping centre called gigli's on the other side of the motorway about 10 mins away - this is a good option if you are tired of florence but still want some shopping done. Good food court as well.Overall, clean and big but if you are expecting helpful staff and a cool, quiet place to stay, this is not it.", "Date": "May 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR580777631", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Health hazard! We stayed there in July 2004 as part of a group tour. We were on our way to Florence and spent one night there. The Good: air-conditioned rooms that are spacious and in boutique style.The Bad: they have serious mosquitos and insect problems and there is an electric mosquito repellent device in every room! The walls are full of foot prints from shoes being used to hit those flying insects.The Ugly: there was blood stain on my bed sheet, probably related to their mosquito problem. When I asked them to check, they claimed it was ketchup or other food stain and finally unwilling change the sheet.The Ugliest: housekeeping was really rude, and simply dropped the new sheets and ran away! They refused to set the sheets so we had to do it ourselves...So this hotel should be considered a health hazard and be avoided at all cost.", "Date": "Aug 19, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR969671469", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "breve soggiorno   showReview(19645333, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR794661800", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Bellissimo albergo situato a 30...   showReview(18411024, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR156639902", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Scarsa attenzione   showReview(17442787, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR616014137", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "molto confortevole   showReview(15572821, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR848744029", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Nur mit Auto   showReview(15572822, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR257535275", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Validissimo spero di ritornarci al piu presto   showReview(14737647, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR737130264", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Ho trovato facilmente la...   showReview(11341248, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 19, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR822308667", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "veramente buono   showReview(11378687, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR242162657", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "El hotel es espectacular.
