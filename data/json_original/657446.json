We were upgraded to a suite, very comfortable beds, clean bathroom, elevator to room, and friendly check-in staff. The breakfast was delicious (buffet) and we were able to leave our bags for the day after checkout. A couple of things to mention - firstly, I'd recommend booking online rather than at the hotel - we wanted to stay another night, but found the price being quoted at reception was decidedly more than we had paid online. Secondly, cab drivers aren't always aware of the location, so take a map. While it says Yenikapi, on foot/public transport, it's best to take the tram to Askaray, then it's only a 5-min walk. (but should you be arriving by boat at Yenikapi, it's also only about a 5 min walk). There's building works across the road, but our room was completely soundproof, so not a problem at all.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThis is your hotel if you are just looking for good location...\u201d", "Author": "gudogn", "ReviewID": "UR119429220", "Content": "We decided to stay in this hotel mainly through the recommendation of our local agent for we were looking for a 3 star good location hotel. We read the hotel review prior confiming the booking and from those reviews, we were expecting the extraordinary hotel breakfast, service and location but we could only agree on the last one. But dont get me wrong, service was fine but just nothing special ,you get that kind of similar services everywhere anyway and it is not like they do anything extra for you. In fact, the receptionist was just too busy trying to sell us excursion and forgetting our service request! The location is great though, knowing i will write the reveiw of this hotel, i timed the distance everywhere we go, apparently, it took 30-40 mins walk to most tourist attraction such as, the grand baazzar ,blue mosque and hagia sopia etc. If you do not want to walk, the tram which costs a few lira (probably just 2 lira but dont know for sure as we didnt take it) take you directly to all attractions in minutes because the tram route is just following the main straight road, and the tram stop is just 2 minutes walk from the hotel. We would give 90% to the location of this hotel! also, there were no shortage of restaurant and coffee shops on the way to the attractions. About the hotel itself, like i said, service was average, hotel room is small, and we forgot (or didnt notice) the window was open for us the whole time so there was noise all night as if someone was loading up his trunk all night long! Fortunately we still managed to sleep at night due to the fact that we walked everywhere so we were so exhausted everyday! but we could still hear the noise regardless, we realised the window was open for us on our last night so when it was close, it was a lot quieter although you could still hear some noise. We like to give the credit for the cleaniness of its bathroom as we understand budget and cleaniness usually 'dont' mix together so we were worried about the bathroom situation at first but....true enough, it was small but clean ! The most disappointing is the breakfast as we read quite a few comments about this hotel and almost all of them mentioned about the greatness of its breakfast, it is not like we were crazy about the breakfast but since we already had the preconception about it, so we expected but it disappointed us big time, and from the person of me usually a sucker for juice--any kind of juice, their juice was undrinkable, i really didnt know what was that with the funny looking colour! Their coffee machine was constantly not working, out of the three days we stayed there, two mornings were not working, we ended up had to go out for breakfast everyday. All in all, to us, the most importance of a hotel is its location for convenience, and the clean bathroom as after a long day of sightseeing, a hot shower in a clean bathroom is a must, so i guess we could ignore the fact of a little noise in the evening and the under-average breakfast. Honestly, we might not stay in this hotel again but if you are dont want to pay too much for hotel accommdation like us and make sure you will close the windows at night, this hotel is definately your first of choice.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sibiu, Romania", "Title": "\u201cNext year again\u201d", "Author": "DorelBlejdea", "ReviewID": "UR117689413", "Content": "It was a very good hotel, no problems with the check-in formalities, and the hotel staff is very friendly..we stayed for 5 nights..breakfast buffet was very good..the hotel is close to the main attractions of the city, like the grand bazar, sophia museum, and other..next year we will definitely come back.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holland", "Title": "\u201c5 days and 4 nights\u201d", "Author": "SultanHolland", "ReviewID": "UR113462067", "Content": "The hotel is in the centre of the main city, the service at the reception is kindly and helpfull.

Because the hotel is on the less expensive side, many younger people were staying there coming and going and being loud at all hours, all of which you could hear through the walls.
