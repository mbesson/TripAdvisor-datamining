{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Choice for Tokyo University Area Nicer than the average business hotel, this is a great place to stay if you have business at Tokyo University. Not convenient as a base for tourists, though.It's in a very quiet neighborhood about 2 blocks from the Main Gate of the University. Rooms are of decent size. The restaurant is nice and the the vending machines have everything you might need.", "Date": "Jun 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR272044505", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "RogerR-Phila"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066442-d1074948-r16774177-Forest_Hongo-Bunkyo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1074948", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
