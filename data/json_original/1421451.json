The taxi arrived in the hotel, so I saw that the hotel was one of the hotel in main street and near the sea.. in same time just few steps from Istiklal street. So every thing is just around you.. shops, cafes, restaurants, bookstore, gift shops.. every thing. If you want to go in any other area it is easy to walk from inside the small streets or just take a taxi .. I loved his location. Actually I was really worried, so I remember I was asking many question when I arrived in the hotel reception. Someone took my bag to the room and he was very friendly showing me the options that I had in my room. I was in a renovated room, it was really beautiful with modern design. In bathroom, you can find an inspiring quote written on the shower glass. every thing in the bathroom from soap, shampoo.. even brush teeth. In the room, coffee and tea for free and if you want to take any thing from refrigerator it is extra.. but there prices was good. Also safe box was available in room, many things actually I was happy with my room. It was beyond my expectations :) and I loved it.. but I don't know about other rooms (not renovated), I was with group of people and all of them had same renovated room and was happy about it like me. I was in the 7th floor side room, so I had the view of other roof buildings with Istanbul sky and Istanbul sea from the side .. it was OK with me. I was just happy with my room. I was in hotel for 5 days and cleaning services came every day. They were good actually. Hotel staff was very friendly, also the hotel breakfast open buffet was very delicious and lot of varieties with Turkish food and intercontinental one. Peak Hotel..

After continuous complains, director finally changed our room and guess what......, they gave us a room with two separate beds and not a double . And when I complained again he told it was not possible to change us room a second time (while there were available rooms with double bed. I know this because next day friends of us moved to a room with double bed). Cleanliness??? The friends I already told you, moved to another room because the bathroom had stains! And when my wife checked more thorough... she also found stains! Of course we complained and the next day everything was clean. Positive: a) It is located 15 minutes from Taxim and 1 minute from Istiklal b) the breakfast is good enough c) It has free WiFi in the rooms.
