Very dingy looking from the outside, rooms average. 1 hour after our departure I was flabogasted by a phone call received by the Receptionist at the Vulcan to make us aware of a $200.00 incident debit they had already debited from our Credit Card due to the Servcie Staff noticing a strong smell of smoke comming from the room we had stayed in. I explained that we had not smoked in the room and had been out all night and only stayed in the room from 4.30am - 10am, and it could have been from us being in clubs through the night. This person, said he had already debited our card. I was flawed that he could debit $200.00 for a smell, no breakages, but a smell, I will never recommend or stay at this hotel again, I have never heard or experienced a hotel debiting your credit card of such an extreme amount for a smell that can not be proved that we directly smoked in the room, and we are non smokers... Maybe they should check out there ventalation, the room smelt on arival and the air conditioner does not work to it's full potential and makes noise when in use, and when you open the windows the traffic noise is such that you can not hear each other talk. I have asked for them to email me the contract we singed authorising debit of our credit card for incidents occurred and have not received this...

The 'scrumptious' hot breakfast was simply two fried eggs on dry unbuttered turkish bread and bacon, without any sauce. In addition to this, the ground floor room (beneath street footpath level) had windows that did not open and air conditioning that turned itself off after an hour, which caused a very sleepless night. Cannot comment too much on the service, as we simply checked in and checked out the day afterwards. This is not a location if you are sightseeing in Sydney, but rather if you have specific business in the Ultimo area. The rooms are modern, quite clean and well maintained.

I booked on the strength of a recommendation to stay in Darling Harbour and an upbeat review in Lonely Planet. I arrived mid evening after a very early start in Uluru with high hopes. Settle into my comfortable room, a drink at the bar, maybe something to eat and a short stroll round the neighbourhood. Some hopes My room was small and dark, but I was upgraded because no-one had noticed the leaking fridge. There was nothing to eat and no bar (unless you count the communal vending machine). A dismal walk in the neighbourhood revealed, in every direction, nothing but dark empty streets with a few cheap takeaways. Next day I discovered getting anywhere on foot from the hotel was problematic. It claims you can get to the town hall in 10 minutes. My walk back from there took about 40 with frequent stops to ask the way, the discovery that the direct route on the hotel map wasn't possible, and that even the indirect one took me through pedestrian unfriendly areas and dead ends. Walking to the Central Station (also a promised 10 minutes) proved less difficult but took 20 minutes. The reception closes at 10.00 pm, uniquely in my experience of many much cheaper than this one. It's also indifferent service without a smile from staff who double with other duties, so expect a wait even during 'staffed hours'. When I left I was overcharged for use of the drinks vending machine; something which wasn't checked with me before I paid, and which I was initially told I'd have to take up with the machine's operator. It was only after I insisted that I shouldn't take a hit for a mistake that wasn't mine that the excess was deducted from my bill. I've stayed in worse hotels but never anywhere that so spectacularly fails to live up to its publicity. Because of that it deserves only one star.

Liked having a fridge and hot water for tea in the room. Chinatown and Paddy's Market is a 15 minute walk. Cons: A weird thing about the room, you have to put your key holder in a slot to activate the lights and AC. When you leave the room, all electricity is turned off except for the fridge. When you return, you have to reset you clock radio. Cafe was still under renovation, so no breaky downstairs but there are places to eat around a block away. Have to walk to the main road for buses. Central train station is a 15-20 minute walk up a hill. A pain with luggage and they don't have a hotel shuttle. Location is off the main road, a two block walk. There is an internet cafe around 4 blocks away and a large indoor mall, no public access computers for hotel patrons inside hotel. The staff''s customer service was a hit or miss depending on who you got to help you.

On arrival we discovered one wall of the hotel was completely missing making the entire building freezing. The room aircon/heater did not work meaning we were alternately boiling and freezing all night. Our room was not cleaned during our three night stay, at times there was no hot water, then no water at all, the mini bar did not work due to the builders cutting through the power supply and the bathroom fan did not work. The Vulcan is a nice enough hotel, and will have an elevator once the renovation is complete. We did receive a $50 refund once we complained on departure.

We were happy on the whole and thought it was quite good value but can see where some of the negative reviews might be coming from. On the plus side it cost Aus $120 a night, was not far from the city centre, rooms were pretty new and quite well equipped. You can walk to Darling Harbour in around 15 minutes or there is a very frequent bus service with a bus stop just a few minutes away with buses to Circular Quay, George St and the main train station. There is also a shopping centre nearby so you can buy breakfast and picnic stuff (there is a fride in the room, as in most Australian hotels). It is true that there aren't really any restaurants nearby but there are a couple of take aways and the shopping centre has lots of cafes and a food court. If you wanted to go to a proper restaurant you's probably be looking at Darling Harbour. It's also true that the area is not particularly attractive, but it didn't seem dangerous and we were not uncomfortable walking at night. It was very quiet (the room was on a side street) but it's true there's no lift. The room itself was fine but the only thing we were not too happy about was the service - the reception was closed after about 9.00 pm till 7.00 am and on Christmas Day there was no maid service. Then the next day the maid knocked on the door at 10.00am when we were still in the room. We went out at 11.00am but when we came back that night they hadn't cleaned the room.
