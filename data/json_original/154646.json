{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great place to stay Stayed here for 7 nights. Safe,surrounded by bars, clubs and restaurants so interesting. Easy to get taxi to all attractions through hotel. They accomodated us all which was 3 adults and 4 children-great space for all of us and we were at the rear of hotel so away from the noise of the street. Nothing was a problem-and they helped where ever they could. Best hotel gym I have used for a while. Zona Rosa great variety of retsaurants-from Argentian steak to mexican and KFC. Bought some decent business suits at good prices. If you want comfort, space, privacy and security in Mexico City go to the Amberes Suites-I would stay there again any chance I had-and so would any of my family. Thanks for a great stay Amberes.", "Date": "Nov 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR781824285", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Phil32"}, {"Content": "Great place We (2 adults and 2 children) stayed here for 8 nights in February 2007. This is *not* a five-star hotel; if you expect the services of such an establishment, look elsewhere. However, the services that Amberes Suites does provide are 5-star.First and foremost, the suite we had was *spacious*. It is considered a 1-bedroom suite, which means a huge bedroom, divided in the middle by a foldable screen to create two smaller rooms; a decent size living room, with a small kitchen; the famous alcove, which is a small bedroom perfect for a child; and a small bathroom. This leaves enough privacy to the members of the family, and if you plan to spend some time at the hotel, I can't think of any hotel room that would even come close. Think a small apartment.Our suite was impeccably clean, and linen and towels were replaced daily. It had a large purified water container, which was replaced as needed. There are two smaller TV sets and two air conditioners (we used neither).The rate includes airport transportation (except Sundays). We were greated at the airport by a driver who led us to a new van, taking us to the hotel in 20 minutes. Everybody we met was friendly and helpful, from the driver through the bellboys to the desk agents.Our rate also included breakfast for two (we paid extra for the kids). Breakfast was generally OK (eggs or hotcakes or a Mexican breakfast), and tip was expected.Internet acces is wired and free. Bring your ethernet cable.The kitchen, which had all the appliances, was useless as there were no dishes or silverware. The bathroom was really tiny: no bathtub, just a shower, with mediocre water pressure on the seventh floor. But the towels were thick and large. And the place is spotless.The hotel does not have a lobby, and there is no room service. But it was perfectly located (walking distance to Chapultepec, and all the Zona Rosa at your feet), the suites are great and the people are friendly. This is a perfect solution for families or small groups. We would definitely return.", "Date": "Feb 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR433214348", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "travellerJack"}, {"Content": "We loved Amberes Suites! This apartment hotel was very charming. It was full of personality, including red brick walls and red tile floors. It was big. The one bedroom suites have a balcony. The two bedroom suites are the same, with one extra bedroom and a long window instead of a balcony.They are well decorated. The living room is of good size, with dining room and a little kitchen with breakfast bar attached. There is an alcove off of the dining room, which we used as a 2nd bedroom, and the housekeeper made the sofa up into a bed for us every day. There are two televisions, one in the living room and one in the master bedroom.The bed in the master bedroom was hard, which I actually like. I slept very well.They keep a large bottle of purified water filled up for you. In the kitchen was a microwave, stove, fridge and sink. The only negative was the noise from nearby nightclubs on Friday and Saturday nights. They literally kept us up until after 3am even with the doors and windows closed. Good thing we are night owls.The rest of the nights, the noise was toned down, and we didn't hear it with the windows closed.The tourist office that they describe on their website is not 24 hours and is not in the hotel. It has the same owners as the hotel, but it is located about a block and a half away. Their restaurant is open from 8am-11am and 1-6pm.The service and courtesies extended us were excellent. There is 24 hour security. Mary and Lucia at the front desk speak very good English, and--by the way, they answer your e-mails promptly!All in all, I give this apartment hotel an A+. I would stay there again in a heartbeat!", "Date": "Aug 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR971098399", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Welch"}, {"Content": "Highly Recommend the Hotel Suites Amberes My family and I stayed for a week at the Hotel Suites Amberes. The main features that attracted us was that it was an apartment hotel and the location. They say two bedrooms but there is an alcove with a sliding door that really makes three bedrooms. They provided two extra beds for us for which there was plenty of room. I was very impressed with the room, the service, the hospitality of the staff, and the quiet elegance of the hotel. Very Mexican -- not an American style hotel in the middle of Mexico City. A very fine breakfast is included in the room rate. We paid about $150/nite for 6 people which was a very good value. Easy access to everything. Surrounded by shops, restaurants, night clubs, mercados, etc. They post security at the door and inside at the elevator/stairs plus each room has a safe. Full kitchen with dishes, pans, etc. They provide a sealed 5-gallon container of bottled water and replace as needed. Can't say enough good things about this hotel.If you are staying in Mexico City and need a very comfortable apartment hotel in the Zona Rosa, I very highly recommend this hotel!", "Date": "Jul 5, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR137847155", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d154646-r10831436-Amberes_Suites-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "154646", "Price": "$122"}}
