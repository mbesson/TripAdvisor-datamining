Last time we stayed on the same avenue so I should have known better. It's not the best part of town but overall is fine. The staff can be friendlier but I think that's the Spanish culture. We had a problem operating our safe and I think it took like an hour for someone to come help us. The instructions were soo wrong so if you're going to use the safe, you'll probably be asking for help too. There are a lot of small eateries around the hotel so you won't have a problem there. The metro is SUPER convenient being right across the street so you can get pretty much anywhere. The only thing is that the subways stop at midnight which sucks for such a party town. After hours, they have something called a Nitebus. I didn't get a chance to try it but it seems convenient. The hotel is close to Las Ramblas which is nice. Our room was decent. We had a fridge too which is nice to put bottled waters. We had 2 twin beds (double) which was nice since I was traveling with a friend. The beds were WAY too hard for me though. I even tried padding it with 2 of the thermal blankets but still too hard. We had a HUGE bathroom which was awesome! There were some weird smells though throughout the hotel. Nothing bad but more like concentrated Glade air fresheners (I'm not the biggest fan). We had breakfast included in our package and it was YUMMY! They had an assortment of croissants, toast, pastry, yogurt, cereal, sausage, tea, coffee, OJ, some other juices and my favorite was the eggs and this frittata with potatoes.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "whitby", "Title": "\u201cA pleasant surprise\u201d", "Author": "vacati0nnati0n", "ReviewID": "UR118843978", "Content": "We paid far less for this 3 star restaurant then the ME barcelona which was a 5 star.

The location of this hotel may be its greatest asset. It is directly across from a tube stop, and within easy walking distance of The Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya and Arenas de Barcelona to the west, and Barceloneta to the east. A vast array of restaurants, a supermarket, and other services are all nearby. The decor of the hotel is somewhat spartan, but the overall ambiance is one of quiet and calm, which can be a good thing after a day pounding the pavement, shopping, and sightseeing. My room was on the second floor, down a quiet hallway. Sadly, the only window (small at that) faced a triangular air shaft, so artificial light was a necessity even at the brightest part of the day. One lamp near the desk was burned out and repeated requests for a new light bulb went unheeded. The bed seemed reasonable at first, but as the days/nights went by, it seemed to be little more than a very hard surface with no \"give.\" On the other hand, the bathroom was spacious, and the amenity box (soap, sponge, shampoo, conditioner, comb, shoe horn, shower cap, sewing kit, and lotion) was topped up each day. Room service was prompt, and in my case (early riser), my room was always refreshed soon after I would leave for a morning walk. As I do not speak Catalan, I had hoped for a selection of TV stations that might broadcast in English. There were only two channels -- a sort-of news program (which seemed to be on a \"loop\") and National Geographic. The latter channel aired but two programs repeatedly all week! I did not eat in the hotel restaurant, but the expansive morning breakfast buffet seemed to be a popular choice for many hotel guests. Front desk attendants were all polite and friendly.

The only minor problem were morning sounds, the maids cleaning (vacuming) the other rooms. The location is wonderful, very central, near all you want to visit in Barcelona. The staff, in general, is helpfull, but not so friendly (maybe a city behavior). The only exception was a very unfriendly breafast staff member. So unpleasant, to everyone.

The second room was on the turn of the corridor and was therefore quite a bit smaller than the first room but it was still adequate. Don`t remember having a problem with the room temp even though it was still quite hot outside when we were there. I think this is a good choice for the money.

I will start with the negatives but there were some positives! We booked in fine but the staff were not particularly helpful. No explanation of the facitlites, we werenot told when breakfast was, what was available and when asked about surrounding facilities it always seemed like it such an effort to help us. We had booked a double room but when we got up to our room on the 6th floor, it was a Twin, 2 singles pushed tohether with seperate covers. Not great for a romantic getaway. However, we asked for it to be changed, which they did but only after they stated \" We were not told you had booked a double!\" Not our fault. It was clearly stated on our recepit (booked through priceline via tripadvisor) So we got into our room. Big enough, clean, modern design. The usual cable TV, marble effect bathroom etc. View from the window was of a big block of flats but the main problem was that the room was absolutley roasting so we tried the Air Con. This didnt work and only blew out even hotter air. So we opened the window but there was no draft and the tempareture didnt change. We went downstairs to notify reception but was simply told to turn the air off and just open the window and if that doesnt work \"There is nothing else you can do\" we were told. Not impressed at all. Even a fan would have done to get some air circulating. This made it quite uncomfortable sleeping, luckily we didn\u2019t really spend a lot of time in the hotel. There was no relaxing bar area. All the restaraunt/Bar is all in an open plan reception but I\u2019m not one for spending time in the hotel bar. Anyway, Not to be too negative but there were some positives! Breakfast was good, Eggs, sausage, bacon, cold meats, cheeses, fruit, juices and loads of pastries/ donuts etc. It is located opposite the Poble Sec metro or 20 mins walk to la rambla. Metro was so easy and 2 stops from La Ramblas and is easy access for the Airport railway line and all other metro lines. We walked first few times but with all the walking during the day we ended getting the metro for most attractions. OVERALL: It was okay but I would not go back again. Maybe we were unlucky in our room but the fact that the staff didn\u2019t care about our comfort was infuiating. TIPS: To eat try: Taller de Tapas. Excellent chain of tapas restaraunts, really friendly, cheap and excellent food. The Chick Peas with seaweed and smoked ham was a surprising delight. Les Quinze Nits (The 15 Knights) just of the La Ramblas in Placa Reial. This place was great. Cheap, amazing food, varied menu. Cost us about 40 euros for a 3 course meal and a bottle of wine! However you will probably have to queue. We queued for 40 minutes to get in but it was worth it and the fact that people (tourists and locals) were queueing is a good sign in itself! If you need to watch sport (e.g. The Six Nations Rugby) then head to McCarthys Irish Bar. Its located a bit further up from the point where Via Laietana meets the Placa D'Antonio Maura (near the cathedral). It will cost 2.50 euros for a bottle of estrella instead of the 5.50 euros from any sports bars on the La Ramblas.", "Date": "February 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money\u201d", "Author": "AGSicilyBound", "ReviewID": "UR6743467", "Content": "Anyone staying at this hotel for any length of time will be more than satisfied with the standard of the rooms,quality of service from the staff and it's location easy access to all the sites of Barcelona.
