There are three floors to his hotel. From the exterior it looks like the best and largest hotel in the area. The staff was friendly and spoke English well, which was never a concern any were during out trip. Our room was a king size room on the second floor and in the corner. It was very large and clean, but dated. The carpet is worn and the room did have a damp semll to it. The bathroom is large, white and very clean. For short term, it is fine. The bed was average for sleeping in. There is nice pool and free parking. We were driving and it was easy to find our way to the hotel. The hotel is in Joyuda and other than a lot of seafood restaurants, there is nothing to do within walking distance. Not even a beach. We drove to Cabo Rojo (maybe 10 mins away) for dinner and to Mayaguez for shopping. It all very close together. We visited Bosque Estatal de Boqueron which was nothing more than a short walk through some thin forest, the Cabo Rojo salt flats and the light house - El Far de Cabo Rojos which is a must see. The drive down the dirt road is slow and full of dips and bumps. From there we went to Guanica and spend the afternoon on gilligans island. If you prefer not to take the short ferry ride over to the island, continue down Carr. 333 to the end of the road where you will find the free beach Bahia de la Ballerna which also has a long nature trail running alonng the beach. Breakfast was not inlcuded although the internet indicated that is was. We ordered anyhow ... I would recommend finding a restaurant. My husband had two small freezer burnt pieces of saugage and eggs which later made him sick. I had the spanish omelette (eggs with tomato sauce on top) and toast. I suppose the toast was okay. We were told by staff orange juice was included and that break was discounted for guest, neither of which came true when it came time to pay the bill. On the up side, breakfast is served pool side which was nice.

It's incredible how the Puerto Rican sanitation department has not shut this place down. From the mold infested bathrooms and tiles to the greenish water in the pool.

First I have to say the banquets staff is wonderfull, I mean the zipper of my dress broke before picture session and they helped me mend it. They made special meal for my kids during the wedding, it was great. Anyway, after staying one night at another hotel I came here were all my family was staying and I had a good time. The room was confortable and the bathroom was so big that my husband could actually take a shower without bending. The rooms have carpet when tiles seems to be the norm around. There are phones in the room. The restaurant is the best I had while my stay in Puerto Rico, my kids had home made pasta dishes, my husband some seafood and I had a delicious steak. There is no beach within a walking distance, but you can go on a boat to the little island on front and have a great picnic and day at the beach. We used the BBQ on one of the gazebos and had a family get together. The pool is not deep (6')which was dessapointing for my 6'4\" husband, but it was refreshing and the kids had there own little pool to enjoy.

We arrived at 2:30 AM and we were told that someone would be there to check us in. Because of the inconvienience we were given one free breakfast, the room was musty and not cheery, is out dated. the bed linen looks old and not fresh. My husband and I would like to buy this Parador for we can make so many changes for the better. We have the experience, and I think we can make a difference. The pool we did not used for it had algai. All this place needs is some upgrades and some incentives to be offered to the clients, The lobby does need upgrading and some cleanup, it does look neglected and old, Now the dinning restaurant is nice, needs ambiance. we were treated okay. The rooms need to have Irons and Hair blowers and prettier drapes very old and outdated. We hope to have the opportunity to stay here again but under better conditions. The surrounding areas need alot of improvement and there is no beach! there is water front and maybe at one time before all the housing was put up there was a beach but it needs improvement............ but it has potential......... I hope the owner reads these reviews so that he can make the changes necessary. Its ashame that this area is not being attended too. Puerto Rico needs someone who would care and nourish it.

When we arrived at Perichi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the first view of the hotel where hanging mattresses that resembled the hanging Gardens of Babylon. We all thought, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oh well, they are renovating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put much thought into it. When we got our keys, accompanied with a generic TV remote, I grabbed our baggage and quickly went to our room to try to get a hot shower after a day of sight seeing. Walking towards the room, I saw that the doors seemed old and rustic; I thought it was part of the ambiance. When I opened the door of the room the hurricane sounding air conditioning was on and the moist/molded/cigarette air embalmed my nostrils with pizzazz. The bed covers had a huge unidentified stain right in the middle of the bed. I quickly took the covers and threw them in the corner of the room. When I do a 360 look around the room, I thought I was in the movie Trainspotting. The walls where stained and cracks where noticeable on the ceiling. When I enter the bathroom there was a blue toilet bowl from the 60\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accompanied by a blue sink and blue tub. I have to say that the blue matched perfectly with the blue \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flower power\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tiles on the wall. I walked back to the room and noticed that they where triangle shaped patterns on the rug. When I took a closer look, I realized that they where hot iron marks. It seems that a several guests left the iron on the floor. After I laughed and told many times to my girlfriend that I was sorry, we laughed and played along with the hotels crack house theme. I went to the front desk to complain about the room and they just stared at me like I was speaking Cantonese. For the record, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m from Puerto Rico and my primary language is Spanish. The morning after our arrival we ate breakfast at the hotel. The breakfast was good and I cannot complain about the service. While I was eating, I was looking at the people that where working on the renovation of the hotel. They where spreading a roll of carpet. What was strange is that the carpet seemed old. Then I realized that they where replacing the old carpet with used carpet. Of course, how can you keep a Crack House themed hotel working with new carpet or new appliances. Maybe they just leave the carpet in sea water for days and employ people to intentionally burn the carpets with hot irons just for looks. Overall I have to say that the hotel is a mess, I stayed in the room in the front of the hotel and they seem to be the worst ones in the premises. The staff was nice although the administration keeps the place looking cheap and tasteless. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very sad that on this part of the island there is a limited amount of choices when it comes to hotels or bed&breakfast. My advice is, spend 20 dollars more and stay somewhere else. This is definitely not worth the money.
