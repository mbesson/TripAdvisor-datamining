The hotel is a bit hard to find about half way along Via Due Macelli just after the junction with Via Cappola Di Case above a shoe shop with just a brass plaque outside. If you are coming from the Spanish Steps it is on the right. There is a very small antiquated lift to take you up to the 4th floor where the rooms are but it works fine so not a problem. My room was Borromini, small but comfortable and had everything I needed and was very quiet. The view was over roof tops and the church/bell tower behind the hotel. The bell rings at 7am each morning so no need for an alarm clock! The shower in the bathroom was very small and I struggled with the doors on occasions but the water was plentiful and hot. The breakfast is not good,a choice of only one croissant or bread roll or yogurt and one drink so use one of the numerous cafes nearby if you need food in the morning. The hotel is in a great location being only 250 metres from the Spanish Steps and Spagna metro station and if you walk 250 metres in the other direction down to Via del Tritone and cross the road there is a bus stop used by various open bus tour companies. I took one of these on my first day to get my bearings and see the main sights and found it very useful. The Trevi Fountain is also a short walk away and well worth a visit. Do climb the Spanish Steps and visit Pincio for amazing views over the city and take a breather in the lovely shady park.

We booked the hotel on the hotel web site, and selected the hotel because of the amenities listed on that web site. On the train in to Rome from Naples, we made a call in for directions, only to be told they had unilaterally moved us to another hotel a quarter of a mile away (the Spagna Inn). Our protests fell on deaf ears. Given the lateness in the day and our inability to find other lodgings on such short notice, we had no choice but to take the other room. The room and other facilities at Spagna Inn were not at all acceptable, and not on a level with what we had agreed to. To begin, the facilities at the Spagna Inn lacked nearly all the amenities represented to be available at the Piccolo. Unlike the Piccolo, the Spagna Inn has no elevator, TV room, game room, garden/terrace, jacuzzi, or room service, as advertised on the Piccolo's web site. On our arrival at the Spagna Inn, the individual at the front desk refused to assist carrying our luggage to our fourth floor room up the hotel's small, winding staircase. Essentially, my female traveling companion and I were told that we were on our own getting our luggage (consisting of three large suitcases) to our room. When we arrived in our room, we found the room's safe did not work, and when we informed the front desk of that fact, he informed us that his colleague would try to come by \"around 8:00 p.m.\" to look at it. It took multiple calls to the Piccolo before someone came to open the safe. As a result, we were delayed for nearly an hour in beginning any sightseeing during our one afternoon in Rome. Later, when we got ready to leave for dinner and asked the front desk to call us a cab, we were informed that \"there are no taxis in this region.\" This is unbelievable, given the fact that the hotel is less than three blocks from the Spanish Steps. As a final insult, we discovered the morning of our departure for the Rome airport that the Piccolo's promised \"shuttle to airport\" would cost us $45 - exactly the price of a taxi cab ride. Again, the Piccolo and Spagna Inn failed to provide the services promised, or at the very least deliberately misled us as to the services provided.

When we arrived the lady was very nice and said there was a problem with Michelangelo but had put us in the room immediately next door, which had exactly the same facilities (apparently). We stayed in Giotto and we found the room, the hotel and the staff excellent. It turned out they had made a double booking and that was what the \"problem\" was. I had no problem with this as the room was faultless and had a balacony, large bathroom, wadrobe space with a safe, bedside table, etc. Lets face it, when you're in Rome you don't really want (or need) to go back to the hotel in the daytime do you?! There are so many other things to do and see. With regard to the previous person's dissatisfaction - you need to do your research and read what other people have said and book the right room! The breakfast was just fine and we chose to have this in our room. You can then do what you like and take it out to the balcony if you wish, which is very pleasant (if you have one of course!), or have it in bed. The only downpoint about the hotel I would say is that the walls are paper thin and you can hear conversations and TVs through them! you can also hear people in the corridors and the breakfast being prepared. This, I think, you will not escape in most hotels, and unless you have bags of money to spend in a 5* luxury hotel, I think this is a minor point to have to put up with in this hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anybody and if we ever went back to Rome, I would certainly stay here again. It's in a great location, the staff are fab, the lift is an experience, it is spotlessley clean and comfortable.", "Date": "May 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire, England", "Title": "\u201cTiny and cramped\u201d", "Author": "docus48", "ReviewID": "UR3415898", "Content": "This is in an excellent location, just yards from the Spanish Steps. Our room was spotlessly clean. However we had the world's smallest room. Two very narrow single beds. Barely room between the bottom of the bed and the dressing table. No chair or bedside table. Bathroom was minute, no bath just a tiny shower. Very cramped. No public areas at all, just a tiny alcove with 3 small tables where you took breakfast. Just as well that we didn't want to eat at the same time as everyone else. All the time we were there, 4 days, we saw just 3 members of staff, all of them very pleasant and helpful. But it was an odd sort of place. Fine just for sleeping in, but certainly not the sort of place you can come back to and relax in the middle of the day.", "Date": "April 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scarborough", "Title": "\u201cgreat budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "ricthevicScarborough", "ReviewID": "UR3242461", "Content": "The hotel was everything the other reviews have said.

The hotel is small, on the 4th floor of an office building, but that shouldn't stop you. The rooms have names, we stayed in the Michaelangelo, and from what I could see, there are at least 3 rooms with small terraces. We had one. The breakfast room was just outside and we took a tray with breakfast onto the terrace each morning, a treat. We selected this hotel for location; we walked to the Spanish Steps, very close by, and the Forum, Colliseum, Trevi fountain, and the Pantheon. The staff got us a nice Vatican tour on short notice. They were very accomodating. They discounted the room by ten Euro per night for a cash payment. The amenities included a room safe, dryer, marble bathroom. Average room size, plus the terrace, and what must be the oldest elevator in Europe.

The receptionist called up to see if our room was ready and thankfully it was. We went up there and found a spacious, very clean, air conditioned room. It was fabulous. The bathroom was big, the shower a little on the small side for North American taste's but still big. The hotel itself is located in the heart of it all. We walked to the Trevi fountain, the Spanish Steps and the metro to take a 10 minute train ride to the Vatican City or go the other way to the Coloseum. This hotel is literally in the heart of it all. You have to walk in to the hotel entrance, there's a little desk on the left to check in and then you have to take a lift to your room. It's no big deal. I did week's of research on the internet and I was very pleased with this hotel.
