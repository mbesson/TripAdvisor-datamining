Luckily we did find one of the roads mentioned and my husband said we would do a turn at the upcoming roundabout - and low and behold the hotel was right on that roundabout - no mention of a roundabout in the instructions! The No 53 bus to the centre of Madrid (Puerto du Sol) stops outside and is 1.5 euros each. Buses are frequent and run until fairly late in the evening - we did not dare take the car out of the car park once we had found the hotel. Bedroom was clean and comfortable with full length electrically operated black out blinds. It had wifi and tea and coffee (paper cups) and minibar. The showerroom was well equipped. When returning from Madrid we had a drink on the terrace overlooking the swimming pool which had ever changing coloured lights - very attractive, even if there was some noise from the road. Breakfast was a fairly substantial buffet but cost 15 euros. Parking 12 euros but very secure and underground. We would stay here again if visiting Madrid.

The lobby is spacious and the front desk staff is friendly and efficient. WiFi is free throughout and there are two free computers in the lobby. I had some problems the food service. I tried to eat in the hotel three times. I went to the bar for lunch one day and tried their special (less than ten Euros for a sandwich, fries, salad, and drink). But there was only one person working and she was clearly overwhelmed. There were a bunch of us there, and it took a very long time to get served. The food itself was OK when it finally arrived, but nothing special. It also took a long time to pay since the worker (the only one) just disappeared for about 10 minutes. The breakfast seems greatly overpriced. The continental option is 7.50 Euros for one cup of coffee, one glass of juice, and a couple of pastries. It\u2019s not a continental buffet. The full buffet is 14.50 Euros but wasn't too satisfying to me. Not much selection and not too tasty. In our first room there was a problem with the air conditioner (it didn't blow cold air). They came to the room and said they fixed it but they didn't. On our second day they said they would work on it while we're away and it would be fixed when we returned. It wasn't. So, after two nights in a hot room, we spent the last two nights in a comfortable room. The two rooms were quite different, so I'll describe both. All rooms in the hotel have one king bed and one sofa that can be turned into a double bed. Our first room, on the eighth floor, had a TV mounted on the wall and a stocked minibar. There was enough room left in the minibar for us to chill a couple bottles of water. The bed was comfortable and the room was bright and cheery. The bathroom had a tub/shower and outlets for shavers. You need to be careful using the shower because, if you touch the glass partition, water will spill onto the bathroom floor. The size of the room itself was a comfortable size, neither large nor small. Our second room, on the fifth floor, had a small TV sitting on the desk (not mounted on the wall). The bath had only a walk-in shower, no tub. The partition did a good job of keeping water from getting on the floor. This room has a room darkening shade that raises and lowers with a switch that is beside the bed. The first room didn\u2019t have that. The hotel is not centrally located but there is a bus (number 53) that takes you directly to the Prado and other attractions. There are two metro stops within walking distance\u2014one in a nice neighborhood and the other in a less nice neighborhood. You get to the nicer one by walking across the bridge and turning left. The metro system is quite easy to use and, in July 2012, the price is only 12 Euros for 10 tickets. We had a group of four so that was enough for the four of us to have a round trip and have two tickets left over. A single ride on the metro or a bus is 1.20 Euros. It\u2019s worth noting that, according to one guidebook, there are more than 15,000 taxis in Madrid. It is VERY easy to find one, and they are really CHEAP. We used taxis when the metro wasn\u2019t convenient, and the most we ever paid was 5 Euros. If you ever want a taxi, just look around. You\u2019ll see dozens no matter where you are. Despite our difficulties with our first room and with the food, I thought this was a comfortable hotel and the people were very nice. That\u2019s why I rated it four stars.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel and pool\u201d", "Author": "peter s", "ReviewID": "UR135036361", "Content": "We (2A, 2C) stayed 3 nights at the end of June. Very nice hotel, comfy typical Novotel room, but sofa bed was really too small for our two children (aged 7 and 10).

Friendly reception has good maps of Madrid. Free wifi. Free Apple computers and X-boxes in lobby. Fantastic pool with lots of sun loungers and a handy bar. We thought the bar food was great; kids particularly loved the 4 cheeses pizza (8 Eu). We booked with last minute.co.uk which at the time was undercutting the ACCOR website rate - we paid GBP 166.56 for our 3 nights. For us it was definitely worth the saving to stay out here - the 53 bus was very frequent and convenient as well as well air-conditioned for the trip into town. If you're on a budget remember that the Prado and the museum with Picasso's Guernica (from 7-9) are free some evenings for the last 2 hours that they're open.

They were spacious with queen size beds and a pull out sofa bed. Everything worked fine but as with it seems all European hotels, water leaks onto the floor from the shower/tub because of the short side panel. Is there a problem with having a plain old shower curtain? The bed is probably the most comfortable bed I've slept in at a European hotel. Very firm but well-cushioned. The pool was a definite plus in the hot weather but it is unheated and a bit chilly. Not thrilled with evening dinner at the restaurant. Food was just ok and service seemed to be confused and was very slow. Appetizers and main courses were served at the same times and then another main course took another 10 minutes to arrive and it wasn't even hot. Don't like tepid steak! Breakfast though was very good with lots of choice and the kids are free; a huge plus! The fresh orange juice was fantastic! We actually had a hotel booked near Opera and cancelled it because we felt the 20-25 min. bus ride was worth the savings. The Novotel ended up being less than half the price of the other one. There is a bus stop just across the street from the Novotel with the #53 bus going to Puerta del Sol every 10-15 mins.; 20-25 mins on off hours. This also lets you take in the sights that you might not have seen by staying downtown. We actually saw Plaza del Toros (Las Ventas), Palacio de Comunicaciones, Biblioteca Nacional and other places that we would not have seen had we not been on the bus. We also arrived here by taking the Metro from the airport. You go to T2, hop on, switch a couple of lines and you're there! Takes around 35-40 mins. and another 10 min. walk to the hotel or had we known when we arrived, we could have taken the # 53 bus which is just 2 stops away from the hotel. The transit system is fantastic. Metro and buses are new, clean and very efficient. Very easy to get around. With the money we saved, we took in a flamenco and dinner show at Caf\u00e9 de Chinitas (very good show!) and a bullfight at Las Ventas. Dinner at the Caf\u00e9 was ridiculously overpriced but you can also just take it the show itself. I'd absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone.

There is no coffee provided in the tour group bedrooms. The pool was closed for the winter months. Beware that drinks bought in the hotel are very expensive. It costs more for a glass of wine or spirit than it would to buy a whole bottle in the 2 supermarkets up the road. It is a long way, on the bus, to Madrid but reasonably priced. The trouble with Riviera was that the tour was badly planned & people were left on their own to get around. It seems to be done on the cheap, although they charge as much as other groups that are far more attentive. We had to struggle to pack our own cases into the coach & out & no help to the rooms.

Overall, for a business hotel I still prefer the Confortel (which despite some flakiness with the wi-fi, is a superior hotel throughout, in no small part since it's newer and in better shape). My main gripe with this hotel is basically the worn-out state that it's in. However, I did see on my second week a big sign in the lobby announcing renovations so maybe that will help. Not sure how long the renovations will be going for and whether that will create some discomfort during construction... Some pros and cons: Pros: - Service is very good, especially the front desk staff. I had no issue storing a bag for the weekend and every time I called or stopped by I got prompt and efficient service. Definite plus. - The free Wi-fi was reliable and fast. This is usually a problem for many hotels in Spain, where their connections become unusable around peak times. I didn't notice many slowdowns at the Novotel, and overall it was very usable. - Individual AC control seems to work very well (in many hotels in Spain you stop having AC the moment winter comes in, and considering the Novotel's windows do not open this is a good thing) - Close to public transportation. Cons: - Smokiness - the moment you walk in the door, especially in the evenings, you get hit by the smell of stale smoke from the bar. This should become better in a couple of months (once the new law banning smoking in enclosed public spaces goes into effect in January) but for now it's seriously off-putting. Some of the stale smell also persists in the rooms, including the two I stayed at, where you can see they used to be smoking and now are not (or maybe people smoked in them nonetheless). Hopefully the renovation will help freshen up the atmosphere. - Tired and dated furniture in the rooms, worn carpets and the like. it really seems to be a problem for the Novotels (I had the same issue in Paris). - Fairly small room service menu, and really high charges for anything in the mini-fridge (4 Euros each, regardless of the item). - Not a lot of food options in the area - other than a few restaurants around Arturo Soria - No gym: there's a swimming pool but no place to work out. - Large number of tour groups staying here, which makes it very busy at all times. Waiting for elevators in the morning can be taxing, and there's not a quiet place in the lobby to sit down and relax... So, all in all, I probably wouldn't repeat as long as the Confortel is available, or even the NH Parque Avenidas (which is on the other side of the highway and is therefore more accessible to transport and walking into the city center).", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "bjones21", "ReviewID": "UR84123448", "Content": "Arrived late friday night, the hotel is in a residentail area, and set back from madrids city centre however reception staff were very welcoming.

The area is safe and we were able to enjoy five full days sightseeing in Madrid. I would recommend a 48 hour Madrid Vision pass to include the culture pass.

It was very clean, the staff were excellent and nothing was too much effort. If you want to pick holes in anything, you would be hard pushed and if thats what rocks you boat then I suggest you pay the premium rates of the big 5 star brands. This hotel is wonderful and don't ley anyone tell you otherwise. There is also a fantastic pool for those afternoons or mornings whereby you just wish to sit and chill before embarking on the sightseeing in the city. My only problem was,as in most hotels, the bar and food tariff were too expensive. The location is great although not situated in the centre of the city is it so easy to reach by using public transport. Catch a 53 bus from right outside the hotel for 1 euro and 25 minutes later you arrive in the city centre. Alternatively walk for 5 minutes to the nearest Metro station and again for 1 euro you reach the city centre in approximately 10 minutes. One top tip, if you are arriving by air at Madrid Airport, catch the Metro from Terminal 3, a 2 euro fare will get to the nearest Metro station of, Parque de las Avenidas which then intails a 5 minute walk to the hotel. Acting on this tip will save you \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3'ssssss as a single taxi fare from the airport to the hotel will set you back 35 euros!!!!!!!

The 53 bus takes you from the hotel to the centre of Madrid for 1 euro; it takes good 20 minutes, but I found the journey enjoyable, as you go past several tourist sites on the way. A taxi back in the evenings cost 10 euros. The bar/lounge was great, and the restaurant was excellent. There is an outdoor swimming pool, but with temperatures near freezing, we decided to give that a miss!", "Date": "February 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Orange, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cPleasant stay at the Puente de la Paz\u201d", "Author": "hunybuny8", "ReviewID": "UR2326534", "Content": "My single room at the Novotel Puente de la Paz was nicely sized and the bed was comfortable. The bath was big but the tub was on a platform which made stepping out a little dangerous. It also had a weird washbasin attached to it. I was told it was NOT a bidet but a foot bath (huh?). Anyway, the common areas were decorated in a trendy style and the bar was a great place to meet up with friends. The hotel has a pool but the weather was cold so I didn't get in. My only issue was the location. It's not within walking distance to the center of town. The bus took way too long so we wound up taking cabs and splitting the cost. Also note that the hotel is located in a semi-residential area and the shops close early. We did find a late-night TGIF-style restaurant around the block though. I recommend this hotel if proximity to town is not an issue.", "Date": "July 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cOK business hotel.

Rooms are less good and could definitely do with a makeover. Lots of use of orange, sky blue and white.....last popular in about 1972!! Pretty basic, with not much to recommend themLocation is right on the main ring road around Madrid, which makes it easy to get to from the airport ( 20 in a taxi). No noise from the motorway though.Restaurant was surprisingly good in the evening. I had one really excellent meal there. I thought the breakfast was less good, with very limited hot food, and choice in fruits and bread (although there was lots of it) is not what you'd expect in a 4 star.All in all, it does what you'd expect from a roadside business hotel.
