My experience was average primarily because:a) The rooms  bathrooms were smelly: I think the drain in both the bathroom wasn't functioning which resulted in a smelly bathroom with smelly rooms.b) Air Conditioning was below average: The split units failed to cool the rooms.On the positive side:a) Interiors: The rooms were well decorated with modern architecture. The bathrooms were nice with large mirrors.b) Staff: The staff was polite and helpful.c) Location: Very well located right next to the famous lounge bar called Ku De Ta.", "Date": "Dec 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR617431797", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "RamAgarwal"}, {"Content": "\u9287\u4ff1\u4ee7\u9286\u4f79\u7866\u9287\u4ff1\u501e\u9287\u71b4\u4e9c\u951b?#x201d;   showReview(19955019, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR110000909", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294226-d1155390-r23022910-The_Ahimsa_Estate-Bali.html", "HotelID": "1155390", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
