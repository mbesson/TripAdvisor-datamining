Room and bathroom/shower are smaller than what we are all used to in other parts of the world, but that's just how it is in Paris. After I settled in and mentally adjusted to how small it is, I was actually super-comfortable and really loved the room. The hotel and the room are very clean, all rooms have been recently renovated and are stylish and modern. Maid service was great. Staff is friendly, helpful, and speaks great English. New flatscreen TV in the room worked great and I really liked the showerhead with all the different light options. Central air conditioning there actually works and even though I was facing the street I didn't have any issues with noise at all and slept great. Many people at my business meeting had various complaints about their hotels, but I had nothing but good things to say about my hotel. And of course, the location really can't be beat. St. Germain des Pres is a vibrant and lively neighborhood with great shops, restaurants, and nightlife all around and close to transportation and everything else.

Despite having had previous pleasurable stays at other upscale Parisian hotels, including l'Hotel and Relais Christine, we decided to try the Madison because of its recently completed renovation and, for us, ideal location proximate to the Eglise Saint-Germain-des-Pres and the Saint-Germain Metro station literally right outside the hotel's entrance. From the moment when we first arrived at the Madison until the early morning of our departure, my wife and I were positively overwhelmed by the sincere and caring attitude of the entire staff, from the Front Desk personnel to the delightful young ladies who were in attendance in the dining room throughout the breakfast hours. There was absolutely nothing that we requested, no matter how insignificant or important, that was not addressed immediately, and always with courtesy, aplomb, and a warm and endearing smile. The hotel itself, which is immaculate and impeccably maintained, is most pleasant indeed, its now tastefully renovated and redecorated work completed, and exudes a combination of warmth, comfort, and charm. The dining area, where breakfast is served, is especially bright, airy and appealing. \"Exceptional\" and \"sumptuous\" are the words that my wife and I assign to the breakfast meal, an extensive buffet of eggs, meats, cheeses, fruits, juices, rolls, breads, yogurts,cereals, preserves, hot and cold beverages, etc. ... and as suggested previously, attended to by a staff of positively charming and incredibly attentive, over-the-top customer-focused young waitstaff. Our room, which was in the rear of the hotel and overlooked the courtyard, provided us with something we had never experienced on any of our previous stays in Paris ... absolute and total QUIET!! Throughout our entire ten day stay at the Hotel Madison did we hear ANYTHING at all in the way of intrusive noise ... either from within, nor external to the hotel. In this regard, the Madison is a true haven ... an oasis of peace, if you will, amid the bustle and cacophony of the city's Sixth Arrondissement. And what can one say of the location except that it is among the best situated and most accessible that Paris has to offer. Nearby to internationally renowned cafes, restaurants, designers and chocolatiers, close by the tumult of the Buci area scene, a scant few minutes away from the contrasting serenity of Luxembourg Gardens, the at-your-front-door Paris Metro station and Line #4, which provides easy access to the entire city, Hotel Madison is ideally positioned to explore the area on foot, or to quickly be transported by Metro to the entire city and the environs beyond. In conclusion, my wife and I feel that, in the Hotel Madison, we have discovered Paris's IDEAL home-away-from-home, and intend to make it our Parisian address on every one of our future visits to the city.

Simply put, it is the best of the very best!!", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cwell-designed rooms, good location, great staff\u201d", "Author": "stanMoscow", "ReviewID": "UR108207355", "Content": "i liked the place a lot. the only unpleasant thing was the fact that the room was made up even after i left a \"dont disturb\" sign - i personally dont like this sign to be not respected, but I'm sure for many it is not important at all. all the other aspects were very good - the staff is very attentive and friendly, the rooms are well-designed and in every small thing you see smth special, you see that people really tried to make it a not-just-another-standard-hotel definitely recommended", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - Perfect Parisian getaway\u201d", "Author": "PaulPSydney", "ReviewID": "UR101452045", "Content": "Spent 3 nights at this hotel in the middle of March with my wife, business partner and his wife.

I do not know how the hotel was prior to the the refurbishment which was completed in March 2010, but it was a wonderful boutique hotel in an absolute perfect location in Paris. The staff was more than helpful and had a friendly and positive attitude. It seems that only 5 or so people work the front desk at different times so we really got to know the staff. While there was no \"concierge\" on call the staff did what it could to assist when we asked questions. This is a charming small hotel. Do not expect amenities like a full time concierge and other amenities you might have at a bigger place. The rooms we spacious for a large European city and well appointed. Our room looked out on the church at St Germain Des Pres. You really do not get better than that! Even though we were on a busy boulevard, our room was quiet. For those who might enjoy French TV there is a plasma TV and an IPOD docking station for music. The only real drawback was the price. You can probably get more for a cheaper price, but you will lose some of the spaciousness and the location. If going across the street for a stop over at Le Deux Maggot, dinner at Lipps or just a 10 minute walk to the Seine speaks to you, then this is the place for you. If you do not like boutique hotels or if you are looking for something a little cheaper, than there are plenty of other hotels to choose from.

The bathroom arrangement was slightly unusual in our room. One closed off area had the wash basin, a full sized bath tub and a separate shower. In a separate closed room was a claustrophobic toilet with a small wash basin, but no soap or towels. Breakfast was very ample and the dining staff was friendly and helpful.

I should mention that I had given the manager of the hotel a present of a book on Australian Aboriginal art as he appeared very interested, and found his lack of response surprising regarding my coat.", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "stanelrod", "ReviewID": "UR4994826", "Content": "We were in Paris in early April, 2006, and stayed at the Madison Hotel.

We had a room on the \"courtyard\". There is not a courtyard, just a view at the aircondition equipment. Our friends had a room on the front. We found the room quite and we did not pick it for the view, there is too much to see in Paris to spend time in the room. The metro station is about 200 feet fromt the front entrance.

We live in a large city and are not particularly susceptible to noises. They're attitude was that there was nothing they could do. We ended up leaving to find another hotel.

With exquisite detailing in the lobby and breakfast area, not to mention the stairwells, hallways and bedroom, we were impressed that the hotel felt homey and welcoming, yet had the feel of an upscale establishment at the same time. We stayed in Room 22, which faces the \"courtyard\" -- the one caveat we would point out is there is no \"courtyard\" as the hotel email confirmation would suggest -- the less pricey rooms overlook a narrow outside corridor with an air-conditioning unit and there is absolutely no view. However, the room itself was well furnished and roomy (at least by Parisian standards). It's hard to explain the decor, but with taffeta walls and bright colors in the bedroom (and interesting marble and tiling in the bathroom), it was well furnished and unique--we hardly minded not having a view. However, I did get to peek at the rooms facing the boulevard -- if you can spring for one of them, it would be worth it! The service at the hotel was fine -- brisk, polite and helpful -- everyone was very nice, but don't expect anyone to exude friendliness -- I don't think that is Madison-specific, but is just what you should expect anywhere. Location is THE best in Paris -- If you're going, you should definitely stay in the Saint Germain de Pres area, particularly the 6th district. The hotel is walking distance away from Musee D'Orsay, The Louvre, etc...

You could hear the plumbing through the walls and it was very loud. The staff was nice enough; however, they recommended the worst restaurants.

The fairly recent redecoration has resulted in lovely rooms (we saw two besides our own), and the atmosphere is more that of a private home than a commercial establishment. Our spacious room, #23, faced the Boulevard St-Germain; the tall windows looked out on the church of St-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, a lovely view. The windows' double-glazing kept noise to a minimum, and the quiet air-conditioning kept the temperature quite comfortable. Room 23 now has walls papered in a soft-green fern pattern, edged in subdued gold brocade. In addition to the twin beds we had a comfortable day bed covered in green velvet, with cushions suspended from a brass rail at the back. There were a susbstantial chest of drawers and a pretty antique desk near the windows, along with a lovely light green slipper chair. Nightstands with a drawer were on either side of the beds. The closet had a section for hanging clothes and another with shelving. Between the closet and the beds was a wide three-level unit that was perfect for storing suitcases and other items and ideal for packing without backache. The long bathroom had two sinks, a bidet, and a tub with shower, shower curtain (!), and laundry line. The humidity extractor worked so well that laundry dried very quickly. Room lighting was more than adequate, and the lights by the bed were paraticularly excellent. The lamps on the desk and chest of drawers added to the room's ambiance. The halls are now done in blue and yellow and provide a cheery note on dark days. The room next to our own was done in blue and white toile, while our friend's room had wonderfully whimsical wallpaper (elephants, yet!) and fabric in shades of blue. The Madison's location is ideal, right in the middle of the St-Germain area and only a few blocks from the Rue de Buci (and breakfast at Paul's). A m\u00e9tro is just across the street , and within half a block are two taxi stands. Only a few doors away is Vesuvius, a lively Italian restaurant, and other ethnic places are also near. The hotel's reception staff were amiable and helpful; we've seen the same faces on all three stays now, a good sign.
