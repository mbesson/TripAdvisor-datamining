The place is a simple hotel and a cheap price. We booked online and got the third night free. The rooms were clean - and my wife even looked under the beds. Breakfast was typical cereal, fruit, juice and toast. The location was great. My wife and daughter spent most of her time down the hill at Tanger Mall while me and the boys rode the go carts. The people at the hotel were talkative and friendly.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holland, TX", "Title": "\u201cAwful!

AC doesn't work and the AC units are from the dark ages! Don't stay here!!! Pool is so nasty I wouldn't bath the dog in it. Towels, Sheets & Blankets have blood stains on them and the carpets leave a film on the bottom of your feet! Horrible SMOKE SMELL IN THE ROOMS! Front desk woman is rude. House keeping is a guy that goes thru your personal items while you are out of the room. No food for breakfast. Don't risk it!!!! IT'S BAD!!!! People just leave in the night and try to find another place to stay and there is no one at the front desk during the night. Old terrible mattress and the TV is from 1969 or older & no ice machine that works. Its the BATES MOTEL BUT WORSE!!!! Its not safe to stay here and who knows what you will catch from a filthy room like they have. Not a place for kids!!!!!!

The rooms were all to be nonsmoking, but our room smelled of stale smoke. The carpeting and tile all had cigarette burns as did the linens. The bathroom had built up gunk in the corners including a petrified cheerio. The towels were badly stained as were the linens. When we pulled back the bedspreads, the area underneath the beds included a cracker, wrappers, a pen topper and lots of dirt. The bedspreads were badly stained. The tub was dirty -- the bath mat covered a bunch of dirt on the top and side of the tub and the tub bottom was very badly stained after not having been cleaned for many times. The towels had not been washed with bleach and we could not tell if they had been washed or just left. They were bad in getting new wash clothes to us. We caught the young man who was doing the cleaning and asked him to come in and clean up some of the stuff -- he had left an empty pop bottle on the floor when he was in there. He did clean what we showed him, but it was still not a real clean room after that. I bought some bathroom cleaning wipes to wipe down all the surfaces and the place does not have facial tissue. It may be cheap, but it was, in our opinion, a rip off.", "Date": "June 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "mississippi", "Title": "\u201cVery poor service and some rude staff\u201d", "Author": "darleneMississippi", "ReviewID": "UR32263956", "Content": "There is no service in this hotel.

I just happened to phone to request that our four rooms be adjoining (which they don't have) or adjacent, and I was told that my reservation had been cancelled a couple of weeks earlier. Apparently someone with a name similar--but not identical--to mine had cancelled her reservation. As the desk clerk worked to re-establish my reservation, she refused my repeated offer to give her my confirmation number, and she kept insisting that I was reserving only three rooms, and I repeatedly told her I needed four rooms. When I asked that the rooms be at least near one another, she very curtly told me that they had three tour buses coming in that day and she couldn't make any promises. I called later that day and talked to another desk clerk, and had to make the reservations all over again. Thankfully, we did have rooms when we arrived! I never received so much as an apology for the mix-up. While we were there, the stool in one of our rooms stopped up. First the night clerk offered only to give us towels to sop up the water, saying she didn't know much about unstopping a stool. Well, obviously we would need the stool to be available overnight, so we asked if we could have a plunger. She brought us one and told us we would have to use it ourselves, since \"she wasn't good at things like plungers.\" She said the hotel had never had a stopped-up stool while she had worked there, and she also said that night was the first time a maintenance person had not been available. We managed to get the stool unplugged with the plunger. The lady who was in charge of the breakfast area was quite friendly and seemed to be working hard, but she wasn't able to keep up with the demand of the drinks and food when the area was the busiest. At one point, there was no coffee, juice, waffle batter, or syrup available, and numerous guests were wanting to eat and get on their way.", "Date": "December 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cDon't Stay HERE\u201d", "Author": "knitter01", "ReviewID": "UR11221080", "Content": "This was our first trip to Branson and we chose this hotel.

Booked through the Choice Hotels website http://www.choicehotels.com and discovered that this property is now the Rodeway Inn & Suites. Booked a suite for two adults, 5 & 6 year old, and one month infant. This room came with a crib. The room was very clean and livable. The property was very nice, up to date, clean, friendly staff, but the room....wasn't a suite. The suite was simply a standard double double that they had shoved the beds closer together in, built this three foot long half wall and stuck a double sleeper sofa behind it. I really couldn't complain though, everything else was great. We travel a live and learn style and for the extra $7 it took to upgrade to faux suite, I know better next time. Anyway, at the hotel it was a great relaxing stay. Just FYI the pool is one of the type that is only 3 feet deep everywhere. It was great for kids the age of mine, but older ones might night like it so much. Not a bad location either, between the strip and Tanger Outlets on Tanger. Just down the hill from Krispy Kreme and Peppercorns. BEWARE, the walk up the hill is physically demanding. Older persons or those not fit might struggle a bit, it's only about 300 feet to the strip but the grade is greater than 45%.", "Date": "July 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cNice Place\u201d", "Author": "nubbin74960", "ReviewID": "UR7199838", "Content": "Over-all a nice hotel, comfortable beds, larger rooms, quite, and Tanger Mall is just right down the hill from the hotel.
