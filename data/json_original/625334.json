The triple room was compact (low celings felt like a cruise ship cabin) but efficient, double bed and minibar/fridge in one room, single bed & cute sitting area in other room - each had own bathroom & shower, which was NICE!

It was a surprise 50th Birthday present for my partner and our first time in Venice. I organised a shared water taxi direct from the airport ( \u00c2\u00a325 each) and there was plenty of space with 4 other couples. We were dropped off at the pier closest to our hotel and it was a challenge to locate the hotel, but we managed it eventually ( we were later advised that the taxi diver should ideally escort us to the hotel door direct ). The hotel is charming and full of character and as there had been a cancellation we were offered a room with balcony overlooking a picturesque canal way.Although small, the room was adequate and tastefully decorated.The singing Gondoliers travelled up and down the canal frequently and it was such a happy atmosphere. A nice touch was the hot drinks and snacks facilities on the first floor where you could help yourself at any time. Breakfast was pleasant and there was plenty of choice and although the breakfast room was small it was still enjoyable and one morning we ate on the small jetty by the canal which was a treat. Now on to the Happy Hospitality ! Mrs Anna and Massimo are a credit to the establishment and although neither are the owners , they genuinely aim to guarantee a wonderful break. On my partners Birthday, Massimo secretly organised a private Gondola which picked us up direct from the hotel jetty ( a little bit pricey, I thought, at 110 euro )and gave us a bottle of champagne 'on the house' to accompany us ! A lovely touch by the hotel and the trip was worth every euro ! Massimo also organised a free trip to the island of Murano where we had a tour of the glass factory, another lovely day out! I would definitely recommend this hotel to all who travel to Venice and I hope to return one day.Big thank you Mrs Anna and Massimo :-)", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia Beach, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cDo not hesitate...it's all true.\u201d", "Author": "phylva", "ReviewID": "UR126625496", "Content": "Sept. 2011. we are 3 middle age women, friends vacationing (husbands at home), American, but one originally from Europe..executive, business and physican backgrounds.

They offer discounts for prepaid bookings but charge additional for the canal view, so it turned out about the same cost for a 3 nights' stay. The hotel may be difficult to find at first but it has a very good location, 5 minutes from St Mark's Square, and La Fenice Theatre is just around the corner. We arrived around noontime and check in was easy, staff were friendly and helpful, and wifi was free. We stayed in a double room along the canal and got the room we expected. Two sizable windows which afforded a view of gondolas passing by (and they frequently do especially in the afternoon), and gondoliers singing - a nice treat. This was the cliche we were hoping for and got it. Size-wise we were happy with the room space, and the bed (which was a proper double) was comfortable. We had problems with the safe on the 1st night, and couldnt use it thereafter. The bathroom was heavily scented to our liking (fortunately this went away during the course of our stay) and occasionally there was an unpleasant smell of drainage - probably not unexpected in Venice, and this did not last. Breakfast area was small but didn't get crowded when we went. We enjoyed their breakfast buffet a lot. This included the traditional carnevale pastry, one of the better fritellis we tried while in Venice. And their chocolate muffins were yummm! It was too cold to have breakfast on the boat landing during winter but it offered a nice place to chill out in the evening. It is generally pricey to stay in Venice, especially during Carnevale, and Hotel Becher is no exception. Their pricing however seems at par with other hotel rooms with canal view that we were looking into.

I was hoping that it would be special enough to remember and it was! Its a lovely hotel, with traditional Venician style decoration in a great location. The hotel is very clean, including the rooms and bathrooms. The bed was comfortable and the rooms were lovely and warm which was a much needed as it was very cold but lovely and sunny during our visit! We stayed for 3 nights and found the hotel to be in such a good location - 5 mins from St Marks - 10/15 mins from Rialto etc but we tended to go off the beaten track more than the main attractins and the good thing about Hotel Becher's location is that it's easy to find after a day of exploring!! The staff were friendly and helpful - particularly the receptionist and she even up graded us to a room with a balcony overlooking the canal which was wonderful to look out over first thing in the morning! The hotel was quiet so we could get some much needed rest and relaxation after our days of wandering the streets of Venice! Our room was spacious enough but not huge - it wasn't an issue for us as we were out all day and again in the evenings and literally used it as a base - why wouldn't you in such a beautiful city!!! If you had more than one suitcase then you may struggle to not trip over them! That may have just been the room we stayed in so worth asking room size before discounting. Thebathroom was a good size too with plenty of hot water and towels. The only thing - which i think i saw mentioned on here in reviews - is the breakfast. Its not bad - please don't be discouraged - its just not great! There was plenty of selection of sweet cakes and breads etc - all too sweet for me - just a personal taste. Plenty of tea and coffee too. Fruit juices were a bit odd! The orange was like squash not fresh juice. I would have a selection of cheeses and meats instead for breakfast which was perfectly acceptable! The breakfast room is quite small and cosy but again its breakfast before you head out to a beautiful city so i really wouldn't hold it against the hotel! The only time I suppose it could be an issue is high season and would they fit everyone in if they all turned up for breakfast at the same time! Anyway - we would definately go back to the Hotel Becher without hesitation. It gave us some great memories in a quiet but very convenient location at a really good price. It really did help make a perfect 3 night break for us and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend if you are visiting Venice and want a warm, comfy base for your exploring!

The little alleys are narrow and buildings are quite tall so you can't tell which way you are going because you often don't see the sun and so many of the landmarks look a like.

Most importantly, the staff are fantastic and go out of their way to be helpful. As an example - the day we left Venice the streets were completely flooded by the acqua alta. The man at the counter gave us some plastic boot-type things to wear over our shoes as we walked to the vaporetto.

It's small, or should I say compact, but it's location is perfect for all the main attractions. I have to say I booked a superior room and was at first disappointed in the size of the room but got over that pretty quickley. The rooms are very clean, the sheets immaculate. Look out for the gondola seranades! you have to hang out of the window to watch the gondolas go by with the singer/accordian player belting out traditional itialian numbers! Just fab! Breakfast is very basic but has what you need. I ordered a bottle of sparkling wine to be in our room on arrival - they brought to the room once we had arrived but I couldn't complain as the tray was filled with lots of little snack to accompany it - olives, pistachio nuts, crisps, salsa dip...just a nice little touch.

We arrived at Marco Polo and pre-booked a water taxi at www.motoscafivenezia.it for the transfer to the hotel , yes the cost of 100 Euro is extravagant but well worth it for the views, sense of occasion and the convenience of landing right at the the hotel's mini jetty on the San Luca Canal. We had a room looking over the canal which was a good size with a decent sized bathroom - you have to allow for the fact that space in Venice is at a premium. We had two windows overlooking the canal with frequent gondoliers and water taxis passing by. The room had air con though not needed when we were there in early March. The hotel is 1 minute from La Fenice, 5 minutes from St Marks Square and 10 mins to Rialto or Accademia so is very conveniently placed. Breakfast was typical Italian city small hotel however the room is very cramped and if too many people arrive at the same time it can be a bit of a squeeze. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpfull. One minor complaint was the lack of info in the room regarding the safe, mini bar and tv - I am being very picky here though.

Food in the area is excellent. You have to eat somewhere on the canals. It's a must. One issue though, was the bathroom smell. Smelt like eggs when you woke up after the evening. Staff took care of it immediately every time it happened. The manager gave us a generous discount upon check in. no hassle at all. But did have to deal with it. Last issue was the A/C wasn't working fully and we kept the windows open. This was a huge mistake due to the over population of mosquitos in Italy.

Our room was small but we were advised of this on check-in and offered a choice (small room with canal view or large room without one) and we choose the room for the view which was lovely. The breakfast was good - not too much choice but great quality for what they did have - the chocolate croissants were fabulous and the ham was the best we had tasted in Italy. Nice coffee too. What makes this place special is the staff who are so friendly and so willing to help in any way they can, that you feel like you are a special member of the family or a VIP! For example - we asked if we could take a bottle of wine and sit on the jetty/boat dock thingy one evening - Daniel on reception said this was fine and we were happy just to sit at the table as it was. However he decided he would make it more romantic for us by getting a table cloth, huge proper wine glasses and some lanterns and opening and pouring the wine for us and offering to take a photo for us. Nice touch. He also refused the tip we willingly offered. The next day we asked the lady at reception if they had a book exchange there - they don't (which isn't unusual) but she called the other hotel owned by the same people to see if they had any (they did) and then walked in the rain down to that hotel to get the books that they had available for us to choose from.

Since I work in the travel industry, I did quite a bit of research on which hotel would be the best overall option (incl. actual accommodations/rooms, service, amenities and location). I chose Hotel Becher primarily for its great location near St. Mark's Square/Basilica and the famous Rialto Bridge. Although there was one or two other hotels which also interested us, we were limited by the fact that we were booking the room only one week prior to leaving for Europe. Hotel Becher has a great location, we even found it in the dark of the Venice streets, and is near all the known \"Venice highlights\" that were on our list to see. It is located right on one of the minor canals and has its own entrance from the canal, in case you decide to spring for a gondola to drop you off. We chose to take the vaporetto from the train station to the San Marco vaporetto stop and then hoof it from there to the hotel. In general it was easy to find, once you realize that the entire city of Venice is a labyrinth of corridors. It was great that there were no stairs at the hotel entrance - a benefit when you're lugging around your luggage. Interior of hotel's common areas was very classy and classic Venetian style. Breakfast area is small, however, everything in Venice is small, and the food was plentiful and tasty. Our room was one of the classic Venetian decorated rooms with a view from its own private balcony overlooking the canal - - Awesome!! Although small in size (only a double bed placed into the corner of room), it was clean and modern and the bathroom was sparkling clean. The hotel staff were fantastic at guiding you to the right restaurant, the best local bakery/coffee, and even your best option to getting to the airport on the morning we left. No complaints of Hotel Becher at all. Beyond adequate,comfortable and affordable, earning its 4 star status. Definately offers alot of bang for your buck.

It was so much fun to see the gondola's pass an hear them sing and play the accordian. It is truly music to our ears. Upon our arrival Anna and her husand Paolo greeted us with such warmth and attention. They were extremely helpful in every way possible. Maps were provided to us with all the highlights to see in Vencie. Dining in Venice is incredible. Anna had made reservations for us both nights and we were not disappointed. The piazza right outside the hotel beside the opera house has the best food and very authentic. You must try the Spaghetti a la caprese. The breakfast includes, cured meats, cheeses, an assortment of fruits, yogurts, croissants and bread with cereal and milk. If after a long day or evening the staff will even make you an espresso if you ask. There is nothing that Anna and her staff will not do for you. The hotel itself is in a great area. There is so much shopping and places to see. If you want to catch a gondola ride try to get one between 12:00 and 2:00 it was much cheaper. We only paid 80 euros. Don't tak a gondola near the main square it is considerably more expensive. The hotel will send you to the murano glass factory for free and you will have to make your way back by water taxi. It is nice to see Venice by the water on route to the factory, however not worth seeing if you have to pay. The factory itself we found to be expensive, save your money and buy something outside it was much cheaper. When we return to Venice we will definately stay at the Hotel Becher.

When we checked in,we were given a tiny room that did not look anything like the \"family room\" on the hotel website. There was no space to put our suitcase/no space to walk around the bed since there was a baby cot and a single rollaway bed in the room. To my surprise,when I asked the front desk,I was told that it was the family room...I doubt it though. As it turned out,the room given to us only had a shower in the room which was a problem(with a baby) so I asked to have another room with a bath tub.The hotel staff graciously accepted and put us in another room which ended up being the \"family room\" we saw on the website.This room was more spacious and adequate for our family.

If you travel with luggage, take the water taxi, it will take right into the hotel reception area. It cost around $170 though, but is a nice ride through the city and the lagoon.

There are no such a thing as a car in Venice, you walk from any point of landing.

We also recommend travelling light if you plan internal flights in Europe: limit is 20kg with a charge >$20 per extra kg. Venice was unexpected surprise after Rome (which was dirty, unmaintained, frankly unfriendly and dangerous at nights). If you want a romantic place, it is Venice.

Would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great location, friendly staff, and the right ambience of Venice without having to spend a big slice of their holiday money.", "Date": "October 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "tourist2traveler", "ReviewID": "UR10289103", "Content": "The hotel is a very good value for the money in Venice. We paid 210 euros a night for a canal room which was lovely. We could see the gondolas pass our window and hear the singing. Most of the gondola drivers looked bored out of their mind but I still didnt mind seeing their striped shirts on beuatiful gondolas right outside my window. The room size was good and very charming. Oh, the breakfast was good too. My complaints are as follows but really minor compared to the positiveness of the hotel. The hotel lobby smells a bit like the canals...sulphur-esque. I guess you cant really help that when the hotel is basically on the side canal. The staff didnt seem too knowledgable about the city. She could not give us any particular restaurant recommendations or knew exactly how the allugunas worked (public taxi to the airport).

My husband and I got a corner room with a double bed stuck in the corner. All three of us checked in at the same time and our confirmations were taken by the front desk person, so there was no question that the same reservation was made for everyone. My husband is 6'2'', so the bed was far too small for him. I spent 2 nights huddled in the corner against the wall. Plus we heard the construction outside that began around 8AM. Needless to stay, our stay was extremely uncomfortable. The hotel was sold out, so there were no other rooms.

I would agree with everyone else that this is a lovely little hotel in an excellent location. Everyone was very nice, and the breakfast was good. Our problems came at check out time. We had a 6:30 AM train to Rome. I talked with the girl at the front desk (I don't know her name) about transportation to the train station. Since the vaporetti do not run that early, we had to opt for a water taxi. She arranged for the taxi to be at the hotel at 5:45 AM. We confirmed the arrangements the afternoon and night before our departure. When we got downstairs to check out of the hotel at 5:30, it took over 20 minutes to check out as the man at the desk could not get a receipt to print. The water taxi was waiting on us and we hopped on at 5:50 AM. However, instead of taking us to the train station as was supposed to be arranged, he took us to the airport as this is where the Hotel Becher staff had told him we needed to go. As you can imagine, I nor the taxi driver was very happy about this large mistake. We did make it on the train -- with three minutes to spare, but it is simply a mistake that should not have happened.", "Date": "October 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cSuch a fantastic place!\u201d", "Author": "JeanniesDiary", "ReviewID": "UR10065711", "Content": "What can I say but what a fabulous place to stay in Venice!

The Becher hotel is a small hotel with only 17 rooms and it is romantic and fits in perfectly well with Venice. We sent them a mail asking for a room overlooking the canal and this is what we got. It was a lovely small but very nice room on the first floor so we were almost face to face with the condoliers. in the mornigs we woke up to the singing of the condoliers which was quite an experience. Breakfast was good with fresh coffee made to order. Hotel staff is very friendly and makes you feel at ease from the moment you walk in. The hotel is ideally situated within a few minutes walking of both the Rialto Bridge and the San Marco Square. Prices are very reasonable. We booked our flights first and started checking prices after that. It proved difficult to find reasonably prices hotels. At the Becher hotel we paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 185,- per night. Overall it has been a very enjoyable stay. Would i stay there next time? No, but only because i do not like staying in the same hotels twice. But i can thoroughly recommend the Becher hotel. We are from Amsterdam and Vebice was marvelous; No bikes, trams, buses, metro, cars, trucks, etc. Only walking and boats.
