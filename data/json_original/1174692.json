We had an early morning flight and wanted to be close by the airport but not in a dumpy motel. It was quick and easy to make a reservation; not so much to check in. We had requested connecting rooms and they had us on different floors - it took a while to correct. Oh well, it happens. Shuttle service was prompt, which was appreciated for our 5:00 a.m. departure. (You do have to call the hotel to have them pick you up at the airport - our misinformed reservations person told us they come every 15 minutes and just to wait - we'd have been waiting all day!) The hotel is clean (not the very cleanest but pretty good), and we like the modern concept. The kids had fun playing pool while I checked us in. It's about on par with a newer Courtyard Marriott, but with a more modern/urban look. It's not for everyone, but I like it a whole lot more than cheesy floral bedspreads and dusty drapes. My kids loved the funky elevators and wanted to have a dance party every time we stepped in. The staff was friendly. Free wi-fi and two bottles of free water in the room are nice touches. The pool is small but looked clean - we didn't have time to use it. No real food at the hotel or anywhere close - I called front desk to ask if the shuttle could take us somewhere to eat and was told it would take us anywhere within three miles. When I asked what there is to eat within three miles, I was told, \"nothing, really - you have to go a little more than three miles.\" So we ate at Ruby Tuesday's, which is just on the other side of the parking lot. Would have liked more (better) options but it was fine for one meal. Beds are comfortable (a bit on the firm side but I like that) and the pillows are great. Actually better than at most (more expensive) hotels. I didn't mind the shampoo/soap pumps in the shower but the 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner took the \"simple\" concept too far for me. (They do have a full size hairdryer though.) A channel lineup for the TV would have been nice. So overall, a fine place to stay - not a ton of amenities but great for an overnight before an early flight. The reason I will not likely stay here again - the noise! For a little perspective, we live in the city and I am really not overly sensitive to noise. We were on the back side of the building, overlooking the pool, but we could still hear plenty of jet noise. On top of the jet noise, the A/C unit (separate unit in each room) was ridiculous. My son (who sleeps like a rock) even woke up to complain about it. And worst of all, the motorcycle noise! Wow. Crazy loud motorcycles, tons of them, revving their engines what seemed like directly below our window, until the wee hours of the morning. I have no idea what that was about - was it some special motorcycle event? Just a Saturday night in the industrial park? I don't know, I just know I got very little sleep prior to my 4:40 alarm. Sooo . . . overall fine if you like the modern/simple concept - but make sure you bring some ear plugs.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "McKinney, Texas", "Title": "\u201cSpring Training Trip\u201d", "Author": "Doyle61", "ReviewID": "UR126743135", "Content": "Very pleased with the hotel and the service.

The lobby/bar area was very nice, as was a seating area outdoors with a fireplace and space heaters for the chilly nights. A few things to be aware of: The pool is small and only gets sunshine for a few hours a day, being shaded by the building. The towels in our room were like sandpaper! Literally stiff and rough. Breakfast is by purchase only from a convenience area in the lobby. The breakfast sandwiches were not bad. There is no free continental breakfast or coffee. There are no microwaves in the rooms.

On the contrary, Aloft hotels are young, vibrant, with a catchy design and all the services you need. Including a cool bar (xyz), a good fitness room, and a nice lounge/lobby which is actually pleasant and warm.\u00a0 The smart thing about Aloft is that all hotels are basically identical. Once you've been to one, you know how they work and you easily find what you need, without surprises. The Aloft Phoenix is very close to the airport; a free shuttle will take you to/from the airport or any other place within a couple of miles. It's also next to the train stop to downtown Phoenix, and a few buses stop there too. So if you don't have a car you won't be disappointed.\u00a0 The staff is very friendly and efficient; the rooms are like all other Alofts: smart, cool and just perfect to crash after a long day or a long flight.\u00a0The bed is very comfortable, one of the best for this class of hotels. The pillows though are a bit hard - the must be foam, and as already noted they're not the best you can find. The bathroom is cleverly designed, with the sink in an open area and the shower and toilet area can be closed with a sliding door. It doesn't offer full privacy though, but nevertheless it can be shared with a travel companion if you need to. Bliss products are a nice touch, and in your room you will also find free bottled water, a coffe/tea set and some cool recent magazines (like Wired).\u00a0 This Aloft has also a nice outdoor patio with swimming pool. Nothing fancy, but just perfect to relax outside and cool down.\u00a0 The fitness room is small but good - a few treadmills, a multi functional exercise machine and a few other accessories (weights, balls). In the morning there are also hot breakfast item to buy at re:fuel, the \"grab and go\" food concept of Aloft. Other items are available 24 hours so no matter when and how you get there, you won't starve.\u00a0 \u00a0 So if you need a place close to the airport where you won't feel depressed the Aloft is a perfect choice.

Our flight leaving Phoenix was at 6am, so I thought it best to stay close to the airport. I booked a room online at Aloft Phoenix Hotel based only on the photographs I had viewed on their site. Wow! What a fabulous, clean hotel with many \"cool\", \"Hip\" and welcoming amenities. The room was very modern, with the best shower I have ever experienced, and the bed, lighting and walk down the corridor to our room was so inviting, warm and posh! They had free High Speed Internet and a very large flatscreen TV if you have kids! My son broke a set of headphones, and called down to the desk to see if he could buy a pair, and the concierge told him there were some available in the fitness room. He worked out in the more than adequate clean gym, took a swim in the very modern pool and then was allowed to bring the headphones up to listen to music and keep! Anything we asked for, they had. Shuttle service was quick and free, gourmet coffee in the room, great smelling soaps, and very comfortable surroundings. They have a bar, lounge area, pool table, breakfast area with food to buy. There is a very good Ruby Tuesday's around the corner with great burgers, great tilapia and great service!! The real surprise came when I awoke the next morning to find the bill under my door. $79 for our entire stay! Where on earth can you score a price like that for such a great, brand new hotel! I cannot say enough about this new, hip place.

For this trip we just needed a place to rest our car for the week (saving the $80 to park it at the airport) and for us for one night, then a 5am shuttle ride to/from the airport, which went off without a hitch. Firstly, the rooms are small but very well designed, every bit of space is accounted for and it's quite modern. Love the connecting door painted like a gym locker! Glad to have the free bottles of water, always appreciated in the desert! We loved the lounge with the board games while we waiting for some drinks, as well as the self serve cafe. The pool and gym ares were small but well appointed and we used both. Now the bad. For whatever reason, there is not a seperate light in the bathroom area. If you need to use the facilities after bedtime your choice is to bump into things in the dark, or wake the whole room by illuminating it. Oddity number two, we only had tiny almost travel sized pillows on our beds. I ended up rolling off it a couple of times. My 7 year old daughter's little kids pillow from home was bigger. Lastly, good luck if you're staying here for more than a couple of days, since there is NO REAL CLOSET or DRAWERS. In the bathroom there is a little curtain with some decending hooks to hang a few things. Overall, a cute property that's well priced and different than other offerings in this price range.

They offer a free bottle of water in the room and free coffee in the room. The room was very neat and clean and comfortable.

As a frequent business traveler, my expectations for hotel cleanliness, room comfort and amenities, and basic service have become rather particular, and I am quick to compliment or criticize a hotel based on these standards. That's why I'm so pleased to tell you that the Aloft Phoenix-Airport met, and in many cases exceeded, all of my expectations for a good hotel for a business traveler, and was the antithesis of all the things I dislike about the W experience. From the moment I walked into Aloft, I knew I was in for a refreshingly calm, friendly, and full-service experience at a tremendous price. I was greeted with a warm \"Aloha\" (a strange greeting for a non-Hawaian-themed hotel), and a smile as I walked into a lobby that was beautifully-crafted to make you feel bright, energized, and at home. From the open plan to the modern-and-bright colors to the pool table to the sharp-but-casual bar, the lobby was akin to an upscale European hostel (if such a thing exists)... the kind of place where you feel comfortable and almost COMPELLED to strike up conversations with people from many different walks of life. Every staff member I met was tremendously authentic and genuinely congenial, and went out of their way to make sure we were having a good stay. From the front desk people who showed us how to quickly-and-easily print some documents at the business center (no charge) to the bartender who recommended a restaurant and hand-drew directions for us to the general \"talent manager\" who greeted us each morning in the lobby to ask how our stay was... I felt like each staff member really enjoyed their jobs, and genuinely WANTED us to have a good time. The room itself was a tremendously well-planned smaller space that will feel right at home for those who enjoy boutique European hotels. The bed was amazingly comfortable, the room clean and very new, and the decor simultaneously ultra-modern and relaxing. Unlike the W (form over function), the room was a testament to the beautiful synergy of form AND function, with intuitive and natural placement of all amenities, from lightswitches to towels to outlets, etc. (Again, compare to the W, where I had to move the bed to find an outlet). Wi-fi was very strong in my 4th-floor room, and it was FREE (again, compare to the W, where it was not available at all in the room, and cost $10+ a day to use the wired cord). The shower was roomy and very clean and comfortable, featuring a clever frosted window into the room to allow natural light in. The sink and toilets were modern-looking but worked perfectly (again, unlike the W). I encourage you to stay at the Aloft Phoenix-Airport next time you're in Phoenix, and leave the W Scottsdale to a fashionista who wants to be seen in the lobby. If you're a Starwood junkie with a deep-seated disdain for the W, I think you'll find the Aloft a very refreshing return to the Starwood values and quality that got you into their hotels to begin with.

Overall, I liked it and would choose an aLoft in certain circumstances in the future. At first glance, it reminded me of an upscale dorm, but not in a bad way! It is obviously aimed at young travelers, but worked quite well for this 50-something traveler. The decor is modern, slighty industrial, and mostly Ikea-esque. But I liked it! The desk staff was mostly young, wearing polo shirts instead of suits, but they were friendly and helpful. Check in and any questions were handled quickly and and they didn;t make me feel like I was the \"old person\". There were people of all ages staying there. The lobby has lots of couches and chairs, a bar with several TV's, a computer access area, a pool table and a small area with foods to purchase. The food items included a good variety of choices including salads, sandwiches, breakfast items, soda, juices, snack bars, items to microwave, and other things. Prices were reasonable. At first glance in the room, I was skeptical, but after checking it out a bit, I really liked some of the features! First, there are LOTS of outlets - and none are behind furniture! So there is no problem with all of the tech gear! There is a large desk, a table, a built-in bench/couch that a small person could probably sleep on if needed. The closet is open, with a curtain and open shelves. There is no dresser or drawers. The bathroom has a LARGE countertop, which was great, and a sliding door to close off the toilet/shower area. There is also a cube fridge. All of the furniture is built-in. The rooms seemed to be pretty well sound insulated, it was pretty quiet when I was there, but it wasn't very high occupancy. The wireless internet is free! And there is a unit on the desk to plug your electronics (laptop, games, etc) and you can show it on the large HD TV. Parking is free, but I found that I did not use my rental car, since the Metro was fast, cheap and convenient. There is a nice patio and small pool with lots of chairs and couches. The building shades the pool/patio by mid-afternoon, so if you want sun, go earlier in the day. The location is great, right across the street from the free airport shuttle drop-off spot, across the street from the Metro (light rail) station (All day pass is $3.50, get to the Convention Center in about 20 minutes!), next to a convenience store, and just steps to a Ruby Tuesday Restaurant (not fine dining, but OK when you just need a meal!) Overall I really liked it, but there were a couple of drawbacks -the biggest one was that the heating/cooling unit in room was loud (you had to change the TV volume every time it went on or off) and it created a draft. Other minor issues were that occasionally airplane noise was a bit loud, but not a huge problem, and in the bathroom there are no rods or hooks to hang your hand towel near the sink. So for a comfiortable, convenient room near the Phoenix airport, the aLoft hotel is a good choice.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cA ray of sunshine with exceptional service in the desert !\u201d", "Author": "Geekontherun", "ReviewID": "UR64438963", "Content": "If your traveling on business this is the place to stay! They offer shuttle service to and from the airport. They are SOOOO nice and truly care about their guests. They PAMPER you! I am a seasoned traveler and they treated me like the goddess I know I am! I left my bags at the desk when I arrived and when I came back after work they had my bags set up for me. They had my fridge with diet sodas, cookies, tooth brush, tooth paste, and razor waiting for me! They were cheerful when I arrived (VERY EARLY) put me in a cozy room with a great view of the mountains. It is close to the airport, Tempe, Phoenix, and rental car facility. Across the street from the light rail which can take you to anywhere including some of the well know restaurants such as Raw, Macayos, Gordon Biersch just to name a few. There are shops and boutiques along mill avenue. Arizona Mills is an outlet mall (need a car rental or taxi) nearby. They also have Tempe Marketplace (also taxi or rental car) which has clothing stores, restaurants, and movie theatre. Camelback mountain which is popular for hiking is about 15 minutes away! You can eat downstairs for breakfast or pickup food to go. They have a bar that is open at 5 pm with snacks and food service if you are exhausted and don't want to leave. They have several places you can have snacks at within the hotel if you don't want to leave. They have a workout facility that is amazing!

There is a sliding door that doesn't close all the way on the shower and toilet stall. It was kind of odd. The hotel has a very youthful and trendy vibe to it. There are not a lot of restaurants nearby except a Ruby Tuesday, though if you drive a couple a miles there is a Starbucks and maybe some other options.

There is only a shower albeit a large one. The clientele the night we stayed seemed to be composed only of a bunch of teenagers. At some point they invaded the lobby, but were respectful.

This is a basically a EURO MOD, limited Service budget version of the high end \"The W\"chain, however Starwood Gold and Platinum guest should expect no upgrade, only 2 types of rooms are offered. The hotel is extremely Euro Mod in design and furnishings (See pics), in fact my room is very similar to a room i had in Spain at the Le Meridian, Barcelona (STarwood). Adequate desk and workspace with convenient power ports, a interface to play video and audio on the Phillips Flat screen TV in the room, large roomy king bed with nice headboard and good lighting and a great Retro Alarm Clock (In form and function)! Bathroom and shower are small, the water pressure in the shower is abysmal, too bad as they have a fun and funky large round shower head that would be a treat with decent water pressure. Bliss Spa products in the bathroom ( Ala The W chain) is a real surprise!. Not a big fan of the shampoo and body wash dispensers in the shower, but they appear tamper resistant. Sadly, they skimped a bit on the bedding, the sheets and pillow cases are coarse and of a low thread count. many limited service hotels have upgrading their bedding these days so it is a bit surprising to see a Starwood new chain, the company being known to have started the upgraded bedding wars with their \"Heavenly Bed\", skimp in this department. But I love this hotel, maybe it is the ultra modern rooms at a great price point, or the excellent accommodating genuinely friendly staff, The Free Wifi all over the hotel, the cool bar downstairs and funky lobby, it all works. The Aloft does not have room service, they do offer a limited food selection at a food and beverage pantry next to the front desk, however next door is a convenience store and behind the hotel is a Ruby Tuesday restaurant. The hotel is located at a Rail stop, 10 minuets straight to downtown and the convention center for $1.50. Airport Shuttle runs on the half hour in the mornings and on demand other hours, 5 Minuets from PHX.
