Our was fuzzy and the color was awful,. The parking also at this motel is a night mare if they are full. One night we had to park in the hotel parking lot next to them as there was full. The hotel next to them are out of business at this moment. ( I don't know what you would do if they had been in business). Two nights we had to park in the very back of the motel. The ice machine in the front building doesn't work. The continental breakfast is awful as well. I suggest bring your own or go to a local restaurant. The donuts tasted like play doe. The waffle's were ok but there is a long line for those. And you have to make your own. There were two kinds of cereal, milk, orange and apple juice and coffee. We didn't book this room to spend all our time in it, but thought if we had gotten to hot we could go cool off in the room for a while kick back and watch a movie, the pool looked clean, but we never used it and it closes at 10:00 PM. The house keeping at this hotel is another issue as well. One day we left at 9:30 am returned at 6:30 PM and our room had not been cleaned. I complained to the front desk and when returned at 11:30 PM it was clean, then the next day we left early return around 6:00 PM the room had been clean but they turned our air conditioner off, which didin't work all that well, it took about 2 to 3 hours to cool our room off. And of course we were there during the heat wave they had in Missouri in August temp well in 100 + range and high 80 at night. The desk clerk really didn't care about any of our complaints.
