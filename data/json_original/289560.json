We found it to be an oasis. While the place is in the middle of renovations the rooms are still quite comfortable. The room and bathroom are large and the balcony adds a touch of luxury for a very affordable price. It is located on the main road near both the beach and the quaint town center. Most of all the owner and his parents treated us like family and we hope to return again someday. As for the town of Boqueron we discovered that it is mainly a local vacation spot. It's quiet during the week but comes alive during the weekends which is when the Velero Beach Restaurant is open. If you're looking for spring break Cancun this is not the place. Great place for a quiet restful vacation.", "Date": "Jun 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR544475176", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Pennylane78"}, {"Content": "We got married @ Velero - It was MAGIC!

We pulled up and thought we may have the wrong place, so we took a moment to look at our map. The lady on the front porch gave us dirty looks the entire time we sat there. The place looked like a hole in the wall. We left and found a room in Cabo Rojo for that night.Also, I would not recommend staying in Boqueron, Puerto Rico. This is an area where locals vacation, so they do not seem to welcome outsiders. At least that was the feeling we got. We felt very uncomfortable in this area of Puerto Rico.", "Date": "Mar 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR814565579", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "brookej79"}, {"Content": "Appalling Under no circumstances would I ever venture inside this hotel again, I had a 2 night reservation and left after 1 and then at 5.30am in the morning. The hotel is close to being derilict and the room given to me contained absolutely no furniture apart from a very cheap and nasty bed furnished exclusively in nylon. There was no hot water in the bathroom at any time, no TV and an A/C unit that sounded like a jet engine. The claimed seafood restaurant does not operate and has not for some time. Room decor has to be seen to be believed, the walls look as though someone has thrown a can of paint at them and it has run everywhere! Appalling is the only word I can find for it and a disgrace that trip advisors even feature it.", "Date": "May 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR682874292", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "BEST KEPT SECRET - A Qaint Hotel in A Qaint Town I hope to encourage others to try the wonderful Velero Beach Hotel. We stayed for a week there at the end of March 2005, over the Easter Weekend. We had no problems making reservations, and even learned that we could secure a discount for the time we stayed by paying all fees in advance. Rates were unbelievably affordable! The staff was very friendly, easy to get by telephone and happily corresponded with us by email to secure all details. Daily cleaning of the rooms was included in the price quoted. Guests get id bands as the hotel keeps out wanderers. Rooms are minimalistic - decent bed, a few extra patio chairs that could be taken out on the deck, a nightstand, television and small refrigerator, bathroom with shower only, and a closet/suitcase storage area...but who stays in the hotel in PR anyway! We hit the grocery store in town our first evening and the little refrigerator kept everything nicely. We made our breakfasts, packed lunches for the beach and saved our moola for going out about town. One of the best things was that the VELERO HAS DEDICATED PARKING FOR GUESTS. This was a lifesaver for our rental given that Easter in Boqueron might as well be Spring Break in Daytona! You do have to walk to the beach, but it's only five minutes and the walk takes you through the main shopping/partying street of Boqueron. The Hotel has its own restaurant which was closed while we were there, but again...any good food and nightlife is only a short walk away. The pizza parlor is right next store. We would definitely recommend the Velero, and hope to go back ourselves in the near future.", "Date": "Jun 6, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR931435259", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Coqui-Coqui"}, {"Content": "Best hotel on DR's north shore An excellent place to stay if you want:-top-notch construction -new furniture -unfailing electricity -satellite TV -to avoid the all-inclusive crowd -excellent serviceWe spent 8 days there-- 9-17 January, 2004, on the recommendation of friends. Can't say enough about it. A small scale resort--27 rooms total. Each unit is owned as a condominium, but most rooms are made available most weeks, as only 4 condo. owners live in their units full-time. This, added to the fact that the hotel designer lives on site, means that the upkeep and upgrades should be good for years to come. Standard package comes with breakfast (order from menu--options include standard pancake/french toast/omelet/cereal options, plus OJ, coffee, and excellent fresh fruit). Wait staff speak good English, and management speaks at least English, Spanish, and French (maybe German, too). Hotel guests included a nice mix-- a number of families with small kids, young couples w/o kids, older retired couples. In our week there, we met English and French-speaking Canadians, French, Dutch, Germans, Swedish, and a few other Americans. Internet room with 2 computers is available for free during business hours. Each rooms has a DSL connection, but we didn't need it. Plenty of nice, cheap restaurants nearby for eating lunch  dinner. Hotel cafe serves basic lunch (sandwiches) if you want to stay on site.", "Date": "Jan 21, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR466132888", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g147319-d289560-r18095722-Velero_Beach_Hotel-Puerto_Rico.html", "HotelID": "289560", "Price": "$115"}}
