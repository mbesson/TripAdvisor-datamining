The man at reception was nice enough but our room wasn't signposted properly so we had to back and ask twice where it was. The room itself was on the lower level of the hotel, with a back door which we found wide open when we came to drop off our bags in the room. The bathroom didn't smell great but had been cleaned to a reasonable level. The shower wasn't clean enough for me to brave it without wearing crocs! And only very cheap soap was provided in terms of toiletries. There was also no where to hang clothes or a towel when in the shower. The beds were comfy enough and there were clean sheets on them, which was a massive relief. But the carpet was very stained and the general wear and tear of the hotel/room itself was very obvious. Trying to sleep at night was difficult, as the train goes by very close by, and is very noisy - as well as member of staff or other travellers banging doors around the building late at night. The \"continental breakfast\" was a complete joke. The orange juice was just cheap diluted stuff, and the only food offered is toast, butter and jam sachets. The hotel does not offer any form of drinking water outside of breakfast times - and the man at reception told us we shouldn't drink the bathroom tap water which was not very encouraging.
