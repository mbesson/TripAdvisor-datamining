I booked the hotel through the hotel's website. I was looking for a comfortable and affordable hotel that was within walking distance of Old Montreal, and this place seemed to have more favorable reviews compared to the other options in the price range. I booked a Queen suite through the hotel's website. Due to some technical error, the online system gave me a confirmation for a King suite instead. I called up the hotel and the lady immediately helped me with the booking. She offered me a Queen executive room at the price I had originally seen on the website and I accepted that (I think there is little difference between the 'mini-suite' and the executive room apart from the sliding bedroom door in the mini suite). The hotel was a short cab red from the train station (about $10), and is also easily accessible via the Metro and a short walk. The room itself was about what I expected - a clean, neat business type hotel. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the room was larger than I expected. We didn't have much of a view from our window since it faced the opposite building, but that didn't bother us. The room is heated and cooled by a built-in unit that has a thermostat dial that allows you to control the temperature. In addition to the bed, the room had a large sitting area with a full sofa and coffee table, as well as a desk and a chair. The bathroom had basic amenities - bar soap, shampoo, shower cap and a hairdryer. There was a little card saying something about asking for more amenities at the front desk if you needed them but we did not need to use the service. The hotel does have a little resto-bar in the lobby that offers room service. The food is not too bad and reasonably priced for hotel food. There are however other places to grab a bite if you don't mind a short walk from the hotel. All in all, I found the hotel to be great value for money.

It was true - this hotel is perfectly fine for a budget place, and is amazingly well located in downtown Montreal. Pros - Fantastic location. The room was enormous and the bed was pretty comfy (if a little on the soft side). Bathroom was spacious and fine too. Free wifi internet quality was good enough for skype video, a big plus. Staff were pleasant. Considering location I think I was lucky to have a pretty quiet room. Last minute availability! Pleasant decor. No bed bugs and high standard of cleanliness. Cons - air conditioning was noisy (though was much better when on a low setting). There is a bit of street noise, the worst being the police sirens, I came to the conclusion there is a police station around the corner due to all the parked police cars in the next street (either that or the neighborhood is a lot more dodgy than I thought!). The worst noise came from late saturday night revellers returning to their rooms though, there is really no soundproofing on the doors and you hear everyone who walks past. Scratchy carpet - but then, it is budget-level so really the decor is more than fine for the price.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cWe borrowed sofa pillows from a friend.\u201d", "Author": "Redgardener", "ReviewID": "UR111853621", "Content": "Good location, clean hotel, decent bed, pillows were useless.

First, the positives: Lovely room. I wanted a room with a safe, which is why I wound up in a suite -- ordinarily pricier than the kind of room a cheapskate like me would select, but I think they cut me a discount because of the time of year of my visit. (Not much competition for hotel rooms in Montreal in February.) Bug free. Passed my flashlight inspection with flying colors. Quiet; I slept well. Great heater, an important factor in Montreal in February. The room safe broke (!!) on the first day, but they fixed it within a mere four hours, which I regard as excellent service by any standard. The in-the-room fridge worked, and a nice IGA market is only four blocks away. Easy walking distance to the Champ de Mars metro station, even in winter. Close to old Montreal, a plus for tourists. Plush lobby. The room didn't include breakfast; instead, they offered a breakfast for $7.50 a throw (in advance) at the adjacent restaurant. I used the IGA and fridge instead, to save money. (Did I mention I'm a cheapskate?) No laundromat, so I had to shlep a load to a buanderie ways out near the Snowdon station, although I probably could have found one closer by. No gym. The room safe wasn't big enough for a laptop. The wifi works. No mattress encasements, which I think all hotel beds should have these days. So what concerns me, if everything was so pretty, and I slept well, and staff were excellent? Just this: if you step off the elevator and look down the hall for your room, you'll notice that the hall is narrow and that all the doors to the rooms are mighty close together. Close enough together to make me worry about how well I'd sleep with partygoing twenty somethings staying nearby on the same floor. That's the bottom line for me. I'm a business traveler. I want to work and sleep. I was able to do both at Days Inn Montreal this February, but all those rooms smushed together in such a close space worries me a bit. More space between rooms gives me protection if a couple of young loadies happen to rent a nearby room. I worry that I wouldn't have that protection at this Days Inn. Maybe it's not fair to site a concern that wasn't even an issue during my stay.

The day after I arrived, an unforeseen personal problem came up and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where to turn for help. Now, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m no stranger to hotels. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve traveled throughout the US, Canada and Europe. I was a Hotel Admin major in college. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve worked in small and very large hotels, I know what they normally will and will not do for a guest. I imagined the manager here to be just another corporate suit like all others with a smile and a policy reason not to deviate from the normal, but I was very wrong. Through my little crisis, I discovered Oliver Michaud - Directeur de la Reception of the Days Inn. It was not his responsibility to help me. It was entirely my problem. Regardless, he went far out of his way to help me find an intelligent solution and to ensure that our trip to Montreal was comfortable, stress-free and thoroughly enjoyable. Frankly, I was shocked. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think this caliber of hotel service still existed anywhere! Additionally, the efficiency of the front desk staff (thanks Simon), the non-intrusive housekeeping staff, the delicious food and friendly service from the team at the attached Allegro Restaurant (thanks Jeff and Joyce), and Mr. Ip (the hotel owner)\u00e2\u20ac\u201c all helped to make our visit to Montreal go from being a potential disaster to one of the most enjoyable. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so lucky! I got a quick 2 day vacation this year and I happened to randomly wander into the caring arms of a hotel whose people made me feel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d found good friends, rather than just visited another chain hotel somewhere in the world. What a pleasant surprise! TIME: 2 days HOTEL: The Days Inn lobby was very clean, and decor very well chosen in good taste. Check-in was quick and easy with an efficient and friendly staff. The indoor parking was full, so like other Trip Advisor reviewers, I too had to park behind the hotel at the cost of $12 CAN \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much less expensive than other hotels/cities (Boston - $35 USD per night). The parking lot is shared with the police department next door, but even so, when in a big city it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s common sense to remove valuables from your car. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be stupid. Our room (618) was clean, 2 Q beds- no bed bugs (found even in the best of hotels in New York or Boston), and again nicely chosen fabric d\u00c3\u00a9cor, tv, small fridge, desk with a chair, free wireless internet (ask the front desk for the smtp info), phone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I think they still charge $1.5 for outside calls from the room, but there are 2 pay phones in the lobby near the elevators, a small comfy chair, a really nice iron, a view of the rue Hotel de-Ville - including the sunset off to the right and of course a clean bathroom en suite with perfect water presssure and waterpik showerhead. The room was smallish, but not uncomfortably small. Unfortunately the windows don't open to get some fresh air (yes, the air in Montreal is fresh), but the air conditioner did a very good job at keeping the air fresh and the temperature comfortable. There is no smoking in the hotel, but you can enjoy some coffee or a cocktail with (or without) a cigarette on the Allegro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open-air terrace, and since the hotel is relatively compact, getting outside is quick and easy with no reason to stink up the room you're going to sleep in with a stale cigarette smell. In fact, it was something I noticed immediately upon entering my room - that it didn't smell hotel-ish or like cigarettes or anything at all. It just smelled clean and nice. RESTAURANT: The next morning we had a delicious breakfast of eggs, fruit, crepes and the always tasty bacon on the open-air terrace of Allegro which is within/attached to the hotel. They also offer a breakfast buffet in the hotel for under $10 CAN but we wanted to eat outside. At Allegro & Days Inn they keep the sidewalk and street area clean, and the little tables & chairs make a very pleasant place to sit and eat while watching people go by on foot, on bicycles, scooters and cars. Jeff and Joyce attended to us, and both offered very pleasant service, making sure that our experience was enjoyable with no pressure at all. Allegro serves all meals and cocktails so I imagine it would have been nice to sit and enjoy an evening cocktail on the terrace as well, but I didn't make the time to do so. LOCATION: This Days Inn sits on the corner of boulevard Ren\u00c3\u00a9-L\u00c3\u00a9vesque Est and rue H\u00c3\u00b4tel-de-ville. It has easy access to many places I'm sure, but I only went to 2 places as noted below due to time constraints. I saw no unsavory activity and felt safe to walk everywhere in the area with my children. Old Town (Vieux Montreal): From the inn's front door you can walk directly across the rue (road) Rene-Levesque onto the rue Hotel de-Ville and it is a 5 minute, safe, beeline walk down to the Old Town Montreal (Vieux Montreal). Rue Hotel de-Ville leads directly up to the steps of City Hall - which sports some lovely architecture and a pleasant fountain at the top plaza area, then directly across the street is Jacques Cartier Pl at the center of all the old town with all it's artists, unique shops and restaurants. Explore. Vieux Montreal is charming. I would urge you to walk across the rue de Commune and onto the promenade too. There is a lovely view of the city from the park at night. You really can't go wrong by visiting this section of Montreal. Chinatown: If you walk out the front door of the Days Inn and take a right across the rue Hotel-de-Ville you are only 1 street away from the Chinatown area which looked interesting but didn't get to explore it or any other locations due to time constraints. Traffic was very moderate and the streets well marked, so with a map of the area and a little advice from Simon and Oliver at the front desk, we got around very easily. There is also a bus stop right outside the front door for easy access to everywhere in the beautiful city of Montreal. FRENCH: Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be intimidated. All the rumors about ill-tempered French-speaking people in Quebec, are not true in Montreal. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE we met in Montreal who spoke French as their first language were exceedingly kind about speaking in English to help a stranger with their smiles and hearts sincere. People create the essence of any community regardless of lovely architecture and historic importance. Montreal is interesting and pretty to look at, but it is the people of Montreal that make her so stunningly beautiful.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cAverage hotel stay\u201d", "Author": "mbellny", "ReviewID": "UR35955949", "Content": "Average hotel in a good location for touring Montreal.

It was economical, close to both the Old City and the Latin Quarter where we had tickets to a special concert, and easy to find (we are not yet well-acclimated to Montreal). We DID choose to park inside and to upgrade the room to a suite with King bed and microwave due to the safety factor and our own needs. First of all, we found the staff helpful, gracious, prompt and very forthcoming with information and tips on how to enjoy Montreal to its fullest. Second, the hotel truly was amazingly easy to get to from Route 10 (coming from New England) - take 10 to the end in the center of the city, find Boulevard Rene Levesque, take a right, go down 12 blocks and it's right there! Third, walking toward the water gets you to the Old City and the Old Port in about 10 minutes; ditto for the Latin Quarter north and several other advantageous attractions. And finally the rooms! We somehow got a conference room attached to our suite, fine for stretching out and I can imagine conducting a small conference comfortably there. The bed was huge and very comfortable, the bathroom was immaculate and spectacular in every way, air conditioner units kept our rooms exceptionally comfortable and the location of our room, close to but not ON Rene Levesque, allowed for a little traffic noise but not enough to disturb us. The room was one of the refurbished suites and soundproofing and comfort level overall was amazing - and the chambermaid cleaned up the room well into the afternoon for us.

While he distracted me his accomplice opened the car and took off with a backpack with my Dutch passport, keys, travel info, etc. While reporting the incident at the police station, conveniently located on the same block, another American hotel guest came to report his truck was stolen from the exterior parking lot used by the hotel (hotel has only limited indoor parking). While reporting the incident to the hotel reception desk a third American guest reported his van had been broken into overnight in the same lot. The hotel is conveniently located, but is at the edge of a rather seedy neighbourhood, and apparently requires some cleaning up.

A well-run hotel with friendly and informative staff. We were able to park outside the hotel while we unloaded our luggage. The hotel offered parking for $10.00/night in an adjacent parking lot (we could see our car from the hotel room). The reception staff were very welcoming and friendly. The reception area was modern and trendy and furnished with armchairs and sofas on marble flooring. The hotel was located on Rene-Levesque Blvd East within walking distance of the downtown area, Ste-Catherine St, Old Montreal, the Old Port, Chinatown & the Quartier Latin. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant, Cafe Allegro,on our first evening served by a very friendly and overworked waiter who was very accommodating (even offered to go home to get icecream from his freezer, as there was none on the menu!) The meal was tasty and good value in ambient surroundings. We subsequently bought our breakfasts in the hotel restaurant as it was convenient and tasty. Our average sized room had 2 very comfortable double beds and plenty of luggage storage. There was a small window that looked out to the side of the building towards downtown and the port area. The room was rather dark, and we needed the light on most of the time. The furnishings and decor were reasonably contemporary, and all very clean. There was air-conditioning, coffee-maker, safe, free newspaper, free internet access, iron/board, TV, Radio/alarm, hairdrier, decent toiletries. The bathroom was of a good size with good water pressure and adequate towels. We did have a bit of a problem on leaving. When I paid the bill I had worked out the approximate price for extras such as parking, tax and meals, but the bill came to about $40.00 more than expected. When I queried this I was told it was all tax - \"in Canada you pay tax on tax\" I was told, but I knew that my restaurant bills had already included all the tax and tips. I left it at that, but worked out my bill later and realised that I had been charged extra for my 2nd night's stay even though I had prepaid a quoted price on the internet. I e-mailed the hotel on my return to England and sent copies of my bills. The problem was promptly dealt with, apologies made and a refund given.

I have read some of the reviews and found them to be quite harsh and after reading them I was affraid I made a mistake when I booked this hotel. Firstly, I want to assure people that my stay was a pleasurable one. The hotel is in an excellent location, walking distance to all the attractions (old montreal, saint dennis, underground mall). It is located next to a police station so the streets are not as scary as some people suggested. The staff was extremely curtious and friendly, they were quick to suggest places to visit and gave us a tourist map and took to the time to highlight important sites. We went up to the room and it was an average size room, we found that the airconditionar was already working which was nice because it was 30C outside with humidity that felt like you were getting splashed in the face with boiling water. Immediatly however we noticed the eye sores, the curtains and bedspread matched with a 1970's pattern that made me a little ill to look at. The view was of the back of another building, as I understand it unless you get a suite most views will not be very good. The bed was comfortable and everything was quiet the entire night, we stayed there on a weekday which may have reduced the number of \"loud kids\" which some reviews suggested frequent the hotel. There are two other negatives that should be noted, the first is the bathroom light and fan are connected, typically not a problem however the fan sounds like a jet taking off and if anyone gets up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom they will wake up anyone else staying in the room. Also it is so loud that my girlfriend could not hear me talking to her when she was in the bathroom and I was on the bed. Finally, they have one vending machine in the entire building and it only has pop. The problem is the machine is so old it doesn't recognize half of my coins, so I couldn't have a pop. It kept spitting my money back. By all right this is an average hotel, however because of the excellent price compared to other hotels in downtown montreal I immediatly bump it to an \"Above Average\" rating. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to be close to everything montreal has to offer but doesn't want to spend alot of money to get it.
