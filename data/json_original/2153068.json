Air conditioning did not work very well in our room. Staff at the hotel are great! very friendly and helpful! Free Wi Fi in rooms which was very convenient! Overall was satisfied with this hotel.

The staff are pleasant and helpful and will gladly do there best to advise you on restaurants, metro, buses etc. We were on the seventh floor and the room was bright and airy with a modern minimalist feel to it. The bathroom had two wash basins and a large walk in shower. There is a trick to operating the shower and as the room lacks any printed information of any kind insist on a demo even if the porter gets wet doing it. The breakfast was good as mainland Europe tastes go. Plenty of fresh fruit, rolls, cereals and great coffee. The breakfast waiter was a lovely guy who made an effort. From the Hotel the Spagna and Barberini metros are a ten minute walk. We used them to get to the Colosseum and the Vatican city. An all day ticket for the metros and the city buses costs only four euro. There is also a lovely park near by which is worth a stroll if you have a little time left before you leave and is five minutes away. BEWARE of Terravision buses however.. Do not use this Airport bus company when in Rome unless you are prepared to fight you way on to their buses. We found them outside Fiumicino Airport on a Thursday night and had a pleasant journey into the main city centre train station. As it was late and there were few passengers looking for transport that part of the journey was a good experience. As it was such good value we bought a return journey for the following Sunday afternoon and arrived in plenty of time for the half past four bus. We did not know and there were no signs to tell us that we needed to convert our return tickets into boarding passes. A boarding pass would have been a good idea if Terravision issued the same number of passes as there were seats on the next bus. They issued passes to anyone who wanted them and a rough and unsupervised scrum took place as the next bus to leave opened its doors. As we had no passes we took a taxi and saw at least ten deserted passengers left behind as the bus pulled out. Given the lengthy time needed to go through airport security in Fiumicino these poor souls could easily have found themselves missing their flights.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dublin", "Title": "\u201cRome March 2012 - great hotel\u201d", "Author": "amanda m", "ReviewID": "UR126648271", "Content": "Was in Rome for 4 days 3 nights and booked this hotel ...,was great from the welcome we received through to the arranged private car return to the airport ( same price as Taxi ) ...

As part of our booking we were expecting a bottle of sparkling wine and fruit basket this wasn't there and after asking three times we were given a bottle of cheep red wine and a plate of over ripe prepared fruit which was obviously left over from the breakfast buffet. The shower had only luke warm water for first 2 days and cold water on last day of our trip which was to say the least annoying - when we complained the concierge laughed and told us work was being done. Breakfast was buffet style with a miserable selection of cheese and meat which appeared to be same day after day and stale bread for toast. Not very appetisiing at all.

The location of the hotel is fantastic. The design is nice as well. The room was kept very clean and everything in the room worked as it should have. Wifi was free and fast. The bed was comfortable as well. I stayed in the deluxe room which was just the right size. The desk was comfortable to work at and the TV had many channels. The only problems I had with the room were that there was no fan in the bathroom and after you had a shower the bathroom would stay wet for a long time and there was no bottled water in the room ever, and in fact the glasses in the bathroom were simply cheap plastic throw-away cups that were so fragile they would actually break apart when you tried to get the plastic wrapping off them. I have never seen that in a room that cost 350 Euros before. For me though the big disappointment was the service. There were 3 staff that I met while there, one young man was an incredibly aloof Filippino who seemed to not have any idea what quality customer service meant and then there was an older Italian gentleman who was very nice but never seemed to get anything right that you requested from him and then there was the young Italian in charge of the front desk overnight who would constantly try and sell you some kind of car service every time you came back to the hotel if he was not asleep in the hotel lobby lounge chair. It was a very un-comfortable situation. If the service had of been good I would recommend this hotel but the way it is now I would not recommend it to anyone. For anyone who is interested in staying a very nice boutique hotel with excellent service I have to recommend the Hotel Babuino 181, I stayed there a week after the Hotel Berg and it was everything I expected in a hotel.

I didn't know this boutique hotel before as it is brandnew property opening its doors just in May 2011 and it all feels like new - in positive and negative way. The positive side is very nice, elegant, modern, glamour styled interior and decor. The negative side - it still expects construction of some facilities (fittness and business corner reportedly coming soon) and new jacuzzi was not yet working although already installed at suite terrace. The hotel has excellent location, in quiet street just few minutes walking to Spagna Steps, Fontana di Trevi or Via Vittorio Veneto and sitting just stone throw of Villa Borghese gardens. The nearest metro station (Barberini or Spagna) will require also cca 5-8 min walking. Do not take taxi from Termini Station when arriving to the hotel as they will charge you cca 20 eur for a very short ride (and they initially asked even 30 eur). We have booked Junior Suite Cool at highest floor because of its large terrace and interior (be aware the other Junior Suite Trend is not having terrace). Surprisingly, we have received upgrade upon check-in to the next door's Audrey Suite (mentioned also as Presidential Suite) which had even larger terrace overlooking roofs of Rome and Swiss Institute (a beautiful villa and garden opposite the hotel). The size of suite is nice - room itself cca 60 sqm, the terrace with relaxing and dining sitting and jacuzzi of the size of cca 60 sqm and large bathroom with lighting shower, design bath and nice picture of Audrey Hepburn. We have learned later there are more suites available (cca 50-60 sqm each), but the only rooms with terrace are Junior Suite Cool and Audrey Suite. Wifi worked fine in the room, however breakfast would require some improvement - the breakfast room is quite small which itself is not a big issue, but some food stuff runs quickly and is slowly replenished. As selection is not wide - although of very good quality - you have to ask waiter to be delivered with some more eggs, ham etc. The staff is very friendly and helpfull, we had no communication issue and has been provided with answers or recommendations which proved to be right. The hotel is excellent gateway for romantic couples wishing to explore Rome and to be close to almost everywhere in the city centre. A bit higher price is paying off especially for recommended rooms with terrace and breathtaking views of Rome (Junior Suite Cool and Audrey Suite).

Having said that, it is within easy walking distance of all the main sites - we chose to walk everywhere but could just as easily have caught a tram. Rooms: I think we had a 'superior' room, which was reasonably spacious (approx. 20 sq m) and beautifully designed (timber floor/leather bed/planed veneer wall panels/designer lighting etc). it was very clean with good quality bedding and large shower room that was kitted out with nice finishes + sanitary ware. Hotel: Again beautifully designed and very clean. I think different people have different expections of a 4* hotel. I was only staying for 3-nights and was looking for clean, comfortable, unassuming, so the Berg met my expectations. However, this is a very small hotel and I suspect that it might not suit all travellors, especially if staying for longer or travelling with children becuase the level of service, although pleasant, was quite understated and the bar is little more than a cupboard - fine for most travellers who are probably happy to go out and experience rome, but when we used to travel with our children, i preferred a hotel with a bar/restaurant so that i had the option of having a drink on the premises if desired. Food: We didn't try the room service. The breakfast wasn't especially memorable but was fresh and reasonably varied and although things were topped up, they were not topped up as efficiently as they might have been, particularly the eggs and we were only offered one coffee each, which we thought a bit mean though presumably we could have requested more. Note: there are two or three restaurants on the same street as the hotel. we had a very good meal (though not the cheapest meal we had in Rome) at the Roman Cucina next door but one. the one directly next to the hotel also looked pleasant and was also quite cheap but as taxi loads of italians seem to flock to the roman cucina, we decided on that one.

The staff were very helpful. Before we arrived we emailed to ask if we could check in at 9am, due to a very early flight and got a response saying a room would be made available within minutes. We did ask reception for restaurant recommendation twice, once for lunch and once on a Sunday evening. Both times the places were closed so I would keep in mind the need for a guide book! It's very much as expected, very dark, sleek, modern hotel. The room's are the perfect size (we stayed in the Deluxe) and the bathroom was almost the same size as the room! Amazing shower and great cosmetics. Free wi-fi which was very helpful. The breakfast room was small but the hotel has very few rooms. It is typical European breakfasts - pastries, coffee, juice, yogurt, fruit and cereal. I did notice one morning that there was a queue for a table, it dispersed after 5 minutes or so though. They do have a bar, I just went in - didn't have a drink there. It's extremely small, 5 people or so I wouldn't rely on it but the location is great - 5-10 minutes\u2019 walk from lots of great places. The street, whilst central is very quiet. The one negative is that I booked through Voyage Prive and in hindsight I do feel we over paid for what we got. Obviously this was bad judgement/lack of shopping around on my part and not the hotels. This is an ideal spot for a nice break with your other half/friends. I would definitely use it again for a girls week-end.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nj", "Title": "\u201cexcelent choice\u201d", "Author": "nyorker3331", "ReviewID": "UR115315036", "Content": "initially i was a bit worried to stay in a new hotel with not too many reviews !!! i this was an amazing experience from the moment we stepped in until the moment we left. beautiful hotel in a great location close to all the major sites but quite and away from the crowds. breakfast was served to our room daily- Delicious... great way to start our day.... very romantic clean room all new hip and well working wi fi internet... u can not go wrong with this one. marco in the front desk was great... very nice guy ... he was very helpful with lots of info and overview to share. him and david from the night shift made our stay even sweeter. thank u!!!", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful and Romantic\u201d", "Author": "Mariaelena76", "ReviewID": "UR115020231", "Content": "This hotel is amazing, wonderfully placed in the Via Veneto area where you can reach Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti in 10/15 minutes walking.

Berg opened in May this year so everything is brand new. People at the reception desk are nice and helping, breakfast can be improved for a 4stars superior but waiters are caring and trying to help to satisfy your needs.

Its a beautiful 4 star hotel that puts some of the top named hotels to shame!! The rooms stylish, spacious with comfortable beds, great bathroom and powerful shower. Marco and Massimo the hotel staff were so friendly and helpful!! At the time of my booking there were no reviews, so I was a bit hesitant as it was s new hotel but I booked it anyway through Klebster, and am so glad I did. It was the perfect choice, like I said in a great location and I enjoyed the stay thoroughly. Would definitely stay at the berg again!!! Thanks for making my stay a lovely experience.
