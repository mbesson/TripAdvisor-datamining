Cleanliness was somewhat below an acceptable level - we were there for 6 nights and it was pretty evident that they did not clean the bath tub at all during that entire time. Room service breakfast arrived on time, but was almost inedible.

The gym and pool areas were great however every time we went there there was a shortage of pool towels , in the morning there was never any , if the gym/pool opens at 6.00 make sure there are towels ready please. Breakfast was a real disapointment - $30 or even $25 ( if pre booked) was way too expensive. The sausages and bacon were barely coooked , infact the sausages were raw , when I advised a staff member they shrugged and walked off ! Al ot of the plates were still filthy when put back into the severy for use , there was a shortage of cutlery , the juice glassess were dirty and sticky , apart from the hot chocolate there was very little to recommend about this breakfast.

We called housekeeping but there was no answer so we went down to reception and requested for help. Someone was sent to the room immediately but all he did was to sweep away the dirt particles! He said it couldn't be coming from the air con vents as it's a central system and we're the only room with the problem. Well, it was definitely coming from the air con vents because we found the dirt particles when we returned to the room in the evening and again the next morning. But it wasn't a big issue so we just let it go. The second room we got was on the 2nd floor and it came with a HUGE flat screen TV.

We arrived late at night and as we did not realise there were 2 Novotels in Darling Harbour our taxi took us to the wrong one (not his fault of course) so we then had to catch another taxi to this hotel. Had we known how close the 2 hotels were we could have walked, this hotel is a lot smaller than the Novotel which overlooks the Harbour, and I am guessing it is a lot cheaper. For us the location was very good, a short walk to the harbour, about 10 min walk to the train station, and a few minutes more into the city centre. Our room was small and quite basic, but it met our needs. We had paid for our room in advance, and had not booked breakfast as we thought $30 was rather expensive, as we ususally only eat toast, but as we checked in we were told breakfast was included, we did not argue, but took advantage of the toast each morning. Paddy's Market is a 5 minute walk away, and there is a McDonalds between the 2. This hotel is in the China Town district, and we did notice quite a few Asian Restaurants, one of which had a long line outside each night, we did not eat here as we had just come from Hong Kong. We did however have a really good meal at an Indian Restaurant in Darling Harbour, we think it was called \"The Quay Indian\" the food was really very good, and much cheaper than most other eateries around the harbour, we were very surprised to find it more than half empty, if you like Indian food, give it a try. We also took advantage of the free \"walking tour\" which is advertised in the tourist info shop, this took about 2.5 hours and was a leisurely walk around the city, you see places perhaps you would not find on your own, and the young lady who takes you around, passes on lots of facts. and as the title suggests it is free, though the young lady does live in hope of a tip. My tip is go on this tour it is well worth it. Even though we were only in Sydney for a few days we bought a travel pass for a week, we worked out that the places we wanted to visit would cost us more in travel than a pass, and we also visited a couple of extra places so we felt as if we were getting our money's worth, we just kept hopping on ferries and seeing where they took us, we left the passes in our hotel room with the tip, and hoped the room boy would take advantage of them. There are probably lots of similar hotels in the area, but all I am saying is that this one is fine, good location for getting around, basic but adequate, and if like us you are lucky you may even get a free breakfast, however if you have to pay for breakfast go to a restaurant, it is not worth $30", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cNot too bad\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR122135749", "Content": "Close to China Town and Darling Barbour.

We also ordered barista coffee for an extra $3.50 each. This was a mistake. There is a coffee machine in the restaurant (like the ones in airport lounges), so I would have just gone with that had I noticed it before ordering (orders are placed at the entrance, not at the table). The coffees we ordered, however, took 30 minutes to arrive, and were no better than machine made ones.

Despite my best efforts, taxi drivers twice returned me to the wrong hotel, so I learnt to double check which hotel they were taking me to. Taxis queue outside the hotel from about 7am. I was there for Guy Fawkes, and enjoyed the night time crowds - I felt completely comfortable out and about by myself in the area at night. It's an eight minute walk to the convention centre, and just across the road to Chinatown. Bypass the first food hall and turn right, through Chinatown, to a fabulous Asian foodhall on the left which provides excellent takeaway/eat in from a variety of Asian cuisines. I had a standard king room, which was ... standard, and comfortable enough. The shower - over- bath leaked despite my best efforts to arrange the curtain. I did enjoy the view over the Chinese Gardens, which are well worth a visit. Housekeeping was OK: bins emptied daily, toiletries refreshed, but glasses not washed. Staff were generally helpful. The TV remote didn't work due to corroded batteries. (Quickly fixed.) I used the gym daily; it had a lovely outlook and the machines seemed well maintained. Peevishly I took a newspaper from reception each day, as none was provided at the room door. The free wifi in the lobby was interesting; when I told them that I preferred to use my own computer, they gave me a complementary (supposed to be $15) log in for 30 min each time, which also worked fine in my room. They did offer me a 24 hour log in (actual hours logged on only) for $30. I had the continental breakfast once, and as it was a lacklustre affair I couldn't really recommend it.

A fresh coat of paint to remove all the marks on the wall would do wonders. The television reception cut in and out and we were situated in an end room which would double as a two bedroom room. The only real issue with noise was that the room in close proximity left and re-entered their room frequently and the noise of the closing door was irritating and loud.

Waited over 10 mins and then i was asked to wait in the lobby lounge because the key cut system was down. Finally got to my room and everything appeared ok until 1am when I woke up sweating. Switched on the Aircon and the room just got hotter and hotter. went to use the look and noticed they only provided one towel and that the tissue box was empty. I then used the loo and it wouldn't flush. Call reception and the front officer guy came up to my room and noted how hot it was and stated the Aircon was broken. He couldn't get the loo to work either. As the hotel was full except for one standard room, I had no option but to move rooms. Next morning I followed up my complaint and insisted on compensation for the room downgrade ... NO I was told. I was happy and also refused to move rooms again as I was nay there for 2 nights. At checkout I spoke the manager on duty and all he did was give me his business card and suggested I contact him when I want to rebook. Well that went straight in the bin! I cannot believe the poor service. The lack of 'trying' to appease an unhappy guest was non existent. Last year we stayed at Holiday Inn and given it's slightly less standard it was certainly more comfortable.

If the pool was to be repaired you should let customers know on the internet that this was being carried out and for how long it was going to take.

There was also noise affecting my room (partying from somewhere) on friday night. Internally it was one of the quieter hotels I have stayed in, so it was a shame it was ruined by road noise. The other big disappointment was the swimming pool being out of order. I did not find out about it until I went to the pool with my bathers under my arm. No mention on the website or at reception or in the room. I was also told I could not have a bathrobe because I was not in a deluxe room (how petty) but when I also complained about the pool being out of order a robe was sent up. I had a very average, quite pricey, buffet breakfast one day (and not again). 'Barista' coffee was extra. Again, petty on a $30 breakfast.

We left both of these relatively untouched. The evening prior to check-out we asked for our vehicle (vallet parked) to be available for 9:30am.

Based on the experiences from these stays I decided to choose Novotel in Sydney to be the primary accommodation during 2 week honey moon in Australia. Of this two weeks we spent 13 nights in Novotel Darling Harbour in executive floor in two different rooms. My experiences of Novotels have been excellent which also set my expectations to be high. Upon arrival after travelling 34 hours of which 21 spent in plane, we were exhausted. Check in went well, but we were not informed of additional services of the hotel, which were included in our package (executive lounge, free internet). From this started the era, which finally ended up in creation of a new slogan to hotel: \" Never right the first time\". First thing after exhausting travel you want to take a shower and get some food. So what happened was that after getting some water and having rubbed yourself with soap & shampoo the water stopped. Response from reception was that there should have been information of stoppage and maybe you should go to pool. Well no information anywhere, after a discussion a new towel was gotten to get rid of the soap while waiting the 20min for water supply to continue. Getting to the food part continued on the same path, my wife has some diatery restrictions and she is pregnant. So we made an order to room service and specified clearly the restrictions, but still got the salade including non wanted components. At this point I got frustrated and contacted the concierge and gave some feedback. What proved to be the strong point of this hotel was the ability to take seriously the feedback in professional manner. We got a bottle of sparkling wine and a apologies from a friendly concierge. These problems of having to every now and then to ask for further improvements continued during the stays. We had to ask towels to be replaced (supposedly clean towels were full of other people hair + holes), open the safety box which was closed from the previous customer, some times shampoo and soap were refilled sometimes not etc. BUt everytime we asked for service, we got it from friendly staff. So all in all some sloppiness was replaced and having a honey moon such minor things could not ruin the good mood. Two bigger items I would still raise up. First of all putting any people to rooms having a non-sound proof door between rooms is totally irresponsible. During one of the nights spent in room 804, we could actually hear the neighbour snoring and even the words of a low toned discussion. Second was the hotel restaurant Pumphouse. As explained above, my wife has dietary restriction requiring gluten-free meal. So we ordered one and waiter was very clear on what items contained gulten and what not, one of containing was soy-sauce, so the portion was to be delivered without it. After 20min or so food was brought by different waiter and we noticed the sauce on the plate. After (me) having a taste and my wife checking and wondering whether it was soy or not, we decided to return the plate. What happened was that the waiter brought in 2 minutes a new portion, which was clearly the old one wiped from the soy. We could see the soy stains in rice and the fish was still from the bottom covered with the soy. Further discussion with the waiter brought us a new dish and price reduction, but I would never recommend the dinner services of this hotel to anyone. So having these said as a summary. The hotel has a nice and friendly staff, the breakfeast buffet was okay and especially its staff was the best part of our stay. Hotel makes a lot of small things wrong, but is also fixing these if you ask to. Due to experiences of Novotel in other parts of the world I had high standards, which were not met, but in overall the visit was ok. My advice would be, that if you get a special discount (e.g. Accor hot deals) this can be value for money or at least an average stay, but with full price, I would never do it. So when having 3,5 stars with price of 4 stars, not worth it but having 3,5 stars with price of 3, do it.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "adelaide", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location in Sydney\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR97907717", "Content": "Our second stay because of the hotel's great location; next to Chinese Gardens, Chinatown, and near Exhibition Buildings, Cockle Bay Wharf, Darling Harbour and the Capitol Theatre.

They had given us the key to the other room we had booked under my name. After getting the correct room, the whole group went to the attached restaurant for dinner.

Check in and check out was easy, location was great, views of the Chinese gardens were pretty cool, and we found our bed quite comfortable, but that's where the pleasantries cease. We had read the reviews on this website (unfortunately not until after we had booked, rookie mistake), so we weren't really expecting as much as we had when we booked, but we were still left wondering where our money had gone to. Walking in to the room described as a \"deluxe king suite\" we felt we may have been given a lesser room like many others on this website seem to have experienced. The room was quite small, and the bathroom was insanely out dated featuring a shower over a high bath with a dismal shower curtain that couldn't even manage to keep the water in the shower no matter how it was positioned, rendering the bathroom floor very slippery. Our package included \"Bathrobes, slippers and deluxe toiletries\". We opened the cupboard to find bathrobes that neither of us would even cut up for rags if we had them at home. They felt like sand paper and looked ratty as anything, and clearly weren't new. The slippers were brand new, but there was only one pair for two people. We opened the kettle to make some coffee and quickly decided we'd rather spend the money on some Starbucks. The inside of the white kettle was pitch black and smelt quite odd. Upon opening the bar fridge we found that something had been spilled in the bottom and not cleaned up. We weren't even supplied with a toaster. First impressions were not good. After exploring for the rest of the day and crashing out quite quickly after returning to our room that night, we woke up, showered, and went to explore some more. Upon returning before going to find some lunch we discovered neither of our door cards worked and we needed to return back to reception to have them reset before being able to access our room. We noticed the room had been serviced. Naturally we were happy about this, until I walked in to the bathroom to notice that we had absolutely no towels. They had taken the ones we used that morning and not left us more. We both thought that this would be room service 101. Room service was insanely pricey, you couldn't order something simple like toast, cereal or spaghetti on toast for breakfast and the cheapest option was a single slice of banana bread at $4.50 a slice. Again, its worth the walk to the nearest Gloria Jeans or Starbucks to get a tastey bagel or muffin with a nice waking coffee. There was no way we were paying $30 each for a dismal looking buffet breakfast when Pancakes on the rocks was a short walk and half the price for the best pancakes you've ever eaten. All in all, for what was supposed to be an experience that was something out of the ordinary, an escape from the mundane life of home, the hotel experience was quite average, and far from \"deluxe\". I would not stay here again, and I would not recommend my friends to stay here either.

The bed was lumpy and creaked so loud that it woke me up every night... repeatedly! The room was cramped and it looked just... tired. There were finger prints on the walls, much of which was dirty. The toilet looked run down and even the handles on the cupboards and the drawers were worn. Breakfast was horrid, leaving us to choose the free instant coffee in our rooms over the sour excuse for coffee that we had at the dining area. Breakfast was the same every day with no variation. The staff seemed albeit daft at times, but soon I learnt that they just didnt care much. I asked for a salt shaker and a waiter went back to fill one up, and conveniently forgot about it. Sat at the same table the next day and there was still no salt shaker! 24 hours to get one salt shaker?! The eggs were dry and when refilling the serving trays at the buffet, the chef was not bothered about spilling the baked beans onto the grilled tomatoes. Never returning not recommended.

Nice comfy room with excellent location. It is 5 minutes walk to Paddy's market and Chinatown. The roads are connected to major attracttions. But most of the front desk staff.... I have no complains about the housekeeping and the breakfast bistro staff as they are approachable and warm. A colleague of mine left a camera at the boot compartment of a cab when she stowed her stroller for her kid and shopping bags together with it. We approached the front desk for help and the only person who was truly helpful at the Front Desk was a guy called Ken. He did everything he could including checking the CCTV for the taxi number but was unsuccesful due to the resolution of the equipment. He called the cab company to report the loss and was updating us on the situation every now and then. It was a totally different story when he was off duty. I had one incident whereby within 5 minutes, 2 of us went asking about the situation update and was told 2 totally different answers, and when both of us appeared together, the staff just smirked and walked away to avoid the situation. There are another 2 incidents with the front desk staff which explaining will take at least another page, which I do not think is necessary having outlined the point.

By this stage my husband had arrived and basically said that we have booked a King Room, if you cannot give it to us we will stay elsewhere at Novotel's expense. The Manager was then called and after about waiting 10 minutes they upgraded us to a 'Deluxe Room' at no extra cost which had a King size bed. I am not sure what the difference is between a Deluxe room and a King Superior but I imagine not alot. The Deluxe Room was comfortable enough, it had a view over the Chinese Gardens and the bathroom was OK.

Very handy location - Paddys Market, Chinatown and Darling Harbour's attractions are all within easy reach - no need for a car! From other reviews I've read, there are some wonderful rooms in this hotel, however I chose the cheapest I could find, which probably negatively affects this review. So keep this in mind when deciding whether to stay here. Despite being very clean, the room I had seemed a bit tired looking. It had an old CRT TV, and one of the lining boards behind the TV was very loose. The toilet had a very old fashioned lever to operate the flush which took a bit of getting used to. However, the biggest complaint I had about the room was that there wasn't much space. While the room was probably a bit small, this was made worse by the fact that every ledge, bench, drawer or anything you could possibly store something on or in was full of snacks and drinks at the usual expensive mini-bar prices. I would have loved to stack my maps, guide books, etc, beside the TV - no can do, there was this imposing stand of brochures of other hotels in the same chain occupying what was the only decent bench space available. I bought a 2 litre bottle of orange juice from the supermarket to stick in the bar fridge - what an ordeal getting that in! The bar fridge was overloaded to bursting point with every imaginable beverage. For some people, that's great and they get variety, but for me, it was a nuisance as I don't use the mini bar so I had to unpack half the fridge, remove things and then rearrange everything just to squeeze a bottle in.

We took on the Family 3 day unlimited Monorail/Light rail pass which was great. We used the Monorail to travel to the City Centre and QVB without wasting time.

It was my Birthday and we were having a party at Bungalow 8 at King Street Wharf and wanted to stay in Darling Harbour. We chose this Novotel specifically for the view of the Chinese Gardens where my Husband and I got married nearly one year ago, but it was the only reason it was chosen. I should have chosen another hotel. For the price it was a great deal. The hotel is quite small and only has eight levels, we were on level eight and had a fantastic view of the Chinese Gardens including another wedding which brought back a lot of memories. What I expected for the price was a clean room (one of the sheets had what looked like a blood stain on it as well as black hair in the sink so not as clean as we would have liked!), a comfortable bed (one of the worst beds I have ever slept on including some recent experiences with 3 star hotels in Europe, this bed was probably the worst we had ever experienced and the pillows were just terrible) and nice service (the woman who checked us in could not have been more disinterested in us if she tried. There was a fantastic girl who was checking in another couple, they were also staying because it was a birthday, we were not even asked why we were staying, no small talk, nothing. She had lovely chipped black nail polish as well and did not look like she had even bothered to brush her hair that morning!). The Hotel decor was quite bland, but modern. Good shower. The room was also really well soundproofed, good climate control in room and great dark curtains so you did not get woken up as soon as the run came up. We did not have time to see the pool or gym and had access to the Executive Lounge but had not time to go and use it. We ordered room service, terrible food. We would have been better off walking up to McDonalds or Chinatown to get a meal. All in all a pretty average experience. The view of the Chinese Gardens made it better, but if you can't get a clean room, a comfortable bed and good service it really does not matter if you get a great view (to me anyway).

Anyway, the room was tiny. OK, not to worry. As long as it's clean, we've got a comfy bed, bathroom etc. Late at night, we returned to the hotel, and the 7th floor (where we stayed) stank of cigarettes. Still, it was late, so we decided that we would worry about it in the morning. The next morning I called the receptionist and told him about the smell and that we would like to be moved to another floor, if possible. The reply was rude. \"Why didn't you ask about this yesterday?\" 5 mins later another receptionist (who was much nicer) called and said that they indeed had arranged another room for us on the 8th floor. We moved upstairs and the room was bigger too, so we were happy. But a couple of days later...the floor started smelling of cigarettes! We told them about it, and fair enough - the smell had disappeared a later that evening when we returned to the hotel. The breakfast is average, to say the least. No cheese, no strawberry jam. The selection of bread was slightly boring and the bread was dry too. The English breakfast was good though. But we won't be staying at this hotel again, and the two main reasons are the cigarette smell and the incredible rude service from one of the staff members (he had a Spanish accent).", "Date": "May 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Limassol, Cyprus", "Title": "\u201cAs average as it gets\u201d", "Author": "sneezing7", "ReviewID": "UR28598231", "Content": "Normally I don't mind waiting a couple of minutes to be served (check in), as long as I receive some sort of acknowledgement from the staff that they have seen me.

Having stayed at several Novotels and Accor properties in the past, I had a certain expectation, but was quickly let down. After waiting several minutes to check-in (which seemed to be the norm- there was a constant wait to speak with anyone at reception), I requested a room on a high floor to avoid street noise (the hotel is on a busy street with a lot of traffic). While I was put on a high floor, I didn't avoid the street noise in the least. I don't expect it to be silent when staying in a major city, but the room was so loud I checked to see if the window was open. I could hear car horns, emergency vehicles with sirens, and loud cars almost as though I was right on the street next to them. The monorail also runs right in front of the hotel which adds to the noise level. I rang reception to request a room change but was advised that I would have street noise no matter where in the hotel I was and I may as well save the energy of moving rooms. The sounds continued into the night to the point that I pulled out ear plugs to sleep and even then could hear it. The bed was quite possibly the most uncomfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in. It was rock hard and so thin that I could feel (and hear!) the springs. It was very difficult to get comfortable and the uncomfortable bed on top of the street noise made a good night's rest almost impossible. I inquired at reception whether I could possibly get more padding or if there could be a solution to the problem (i.e. room change), but was simply told that there was nothing they could do. Other than those two things, the hotel was decent. The room was spotless and clean, though it could use some new furniture, as it looked a bit worn. The heating/cooling system was different and it was either too hot or too cold in the room, but it wasn't a major issue, as I had mild weather during my stay and didn't need to use it too much. I didn't eat in the restaurant, but it looked pretty expensive. There was free internet on the iMac computers in the lobby bar. The service was lacking a bit- I always had to wait at reception and although they were very pleasant when I spoke with them, they were never overly helpful. I requested extra linens from housekeeping one night and it took them 40 minutes to deliver them. The room was small, though it was big enough for just myself traveling alone (it would be tight for a family). The bathroom was small, but again, was fine for just 1 person. The location is great- it's 2 blocks from Paddy's Markets, a nice 10 minute walk to Darling Harbour, and right in the middle of Chinatown. The nearest train stations are Central and Town Hall (it's right in the middle of both, though Central is probably a bit closer) and they are about a 10-15 minute walk, but there is a tram stop right outside Paddy's Markets which will take you right to Central. The taxi to the airport is about 25 minutes with mild traffic and costs about $30. All in all, it was an okay hotel, definitely a 3 star (a 4 if they improved their service and updated the rooms a bit). If you are a light sleeper or need a soft bed to sleep in, I would say find another hotel. I wouldn't choose to return to this hotel and it wouldn't be one that I would recommend to a friend, but it's also not one that I would say avoid at all costs. If you're not picky, stay here- the price is reasonable and it's a good location.

Acceptable for a Saturday night in Sydney close to Darling Harbour. I arrived early (approx 10.50am) and was told, quite reasonably and one I anticipated, that my room was not yet ready. Not a problem for me as friends were already staying in the hotel and I had pre-arranged to leave our bags in their room anyway. I was however able to check-in, be allocated room 416, my credit card swiped (for any extras) and told all was completed and I could pick up my room entry cards later in the afternoon on my return, after informing the check-in clerk I would be leaving the hotel almost immediately for a function. I returned about 4pm and when I asked for my entry cards, the body language of the desk clerk as the delay in processing a simple request to find my room was all the evidence I needed that something had gone wrong. My inquiry as to the problem was met with stony silence. It was evident she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what to do or say and I asked to see the Duty Manager. Without any explanation or apology I was eventually told the hotel was now full but an alternative room would be found. No problem I said, just so long as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got 2 separate beds in it. I was assured a room was available but housekeeping would need a few minutes to put another bed in it. I then had a further discussion about what kind of bed they planned to temporarily install in the room was answered with assurances it was a proper full size bed. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe him and a room inspection as they wheeled in a rollway bed proved he was lying. The room itself would have been okay had it been occupied by the one twin bed that was usually in it. As we were only staying one night it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth the hassle of agreeing to the managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 offer to let him find us alternative accommodation elsewhere so we accepted what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been given on condition the hotel provided 2 complimentary full breakfasts. This was agreed to but I subsquently felt a little peeved by the chain of events and demanded (and got) 4 instead - to cover my friends\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 brekky as well, if only because I felt no-one, other than the duty concierge who was nearby and became aware of my dilemna, bothered to either immediately own up to the problem, and having accepted there was one, failed to offer any kind of apology. Not impressed. The choice at breakfast was reasonable but even after taking account of my now less than favourable attitude toward the hotel, the best I can say about it was that it was only \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Other reviewers have said this is not a 4 star hotel, more like a 3 star.

The fire escape plan of the hotel indicated that there were larger rooms in the corners of the floor I stayed in, but they weren't much larger.

I arrived for two nights stay in May, coming to reception at 1.30pm I was asked to wait, I sat in reception whilst they readied my room, at 3pm I approached the staff to find that the room had been completed 40 minutes earlier. Even though I was sitting 15 feet away, even my bags had been sent up, they did not inform me. Front desk staff was not exactly run off their feet in the time period so there was no excuse for the oversight. I maintain a personal view of the service industry within hotels in Sydney as being superficial, disingenuous, and almost pretentious. My recent experience in this hotel did not change my view. I walked up to the room passing a tray of food left outside the room next to mine. It was ready for pickup. On the tray was a half eaten pizza. The room itself I liked it appeared well presented and maintained this was in contrast to the corridor carpet, damaged decor and paint chipped door architraves. The room service I had later that night was on time and the quality was good.

The staff at this hotel are the most unhelpful bunch of people i have ever encountered. This was our first trip to Sydney and when i enquired if they had any maps of the city avaliable in the foyer or for purchase i was met with a response of \" you get them elsewhere\" The room service/ house keeping was deplorable we went sight seeing one day and went back to the Hotel around 3pm for a rest to find our room still had not been serviced. I spoke to the concierge who assured me they would have someone do it for us if we would like to return in 45mins. We did this, went up to our room and suprise suprise still no house keeping. I was quite annoyed by now as it was almost 5 oclock. i returned to the concierge with complaint and he finally fixed the situation... 2 hours later. If you're looking for a quiet nights sleep... you wont get it at the Novotel Rockford Darling Harbour. All through the night we were woken up by the sound of doors slamming in the corridor as the room doors are quite heavy. In the mornings when house keeping were doing their rounds they were very noisy and i overheard two couples complaining. The location is good, within walking distance the Paddys Markets, Darling Harbour and the Monorail station. This is the only positive to this Hotel.

We arrived early morning on Good Friday at the hotel, knowing that check-in was only at 11am.

The room itself was very clean with a large bathroom / toilet, which was well maintained as well. House keeping was as expected & upto the mark. Checking out took us less than 2 minutes (matter of just handing the card keys in), since there were no other expenses to our bill. We had paid for the room in advance. We only had the room booked (no breakfast included). The best feature of this hotel is its location. Its in the heart of Darling Harbour, walking distance to the restaurants, cafes, Sydney aquarium, Paddy Market, China town & the Cockle Bay Wharf. There's no room that has a harbour view though (as told by the reception). The airport is abt a 20-min taxi ride, that costs arnd AUD 30. There are plenty of local stores, asian take-away restaurants & bottle shops closeby. The Queen Victoria building & other shopping precincts are a 15-min walk from the hotel.

However, given that this time we were going to spend more time out of the hotel than in it, we decided to try the Novotel Rockford. We were not disappointed. Although only what I would class a basic three and a half to four star hotel (when you are used to the luxury with all the mod cons), you can't beat it for the price offered. Fantastic, (in fact perfect), location. About a five minute walk to all the restaurants Darling Harbour has to offer, three minute walk to Chinatown and Market City and about ten minute walk to QVB, World Square and Pitt Street Mall for further shopping. Directly opposite Entertainment Centre if going to the basketball (infact the basketballers were staying in the same hotel!) or similar event and also directly opposite monorail station. Rooms were on the small and basic side, but fairly clean. Bathrooms were quite large given the room size, not complaining. Water pressure of shower was good. Had a room facing the Entertainment Centre and was a little wary that it might be noisy, but was actually much quieter than our own room at home so slept right through! Breakfast is the usual buffet fair offered by nearly every other hotel, but still very good, fresh and constantly restocked with fresh cooking. There are plenty of nice cafes in Darling Harbour catering for breakfast also. Staff were all good and polite, check in and out was quick and painless. Only problems I would say were very minor, but worth mentioning so that people are aware. The lifts were slow and fairly inadequate for the volume of people who were staying in the hotel. Very noisy doors to hotel rooms when being opened and closed in the wee small hours of the night or morning, so be aware you may be awoken by this, but this happens in a lot of hotels! Parking is not directly adjacent or underneath hotel, which means you have to drive to the hotel, unload luggage, then drive to the parking and walk back, but easy to navigate too and not a far walk at all.

We were quite tired, so it was a big relief to know we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wander the streets looking for a place to nap! The gentleman checking us in was efficient and so polite. The room was a fantastic size \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the bathroom was great. There was a temperature and light control panel inside the front door that was incredibly easy to use. We switched the lights on from that panel and then when it was time for bed just turned off the lamps above the bed. The king size bed was very comfortable. We were on the second floor so we could hear the traffic just outside (we were facing a major road), which could be a problem if you are a really light sleeper like me, but I just popped in an earplug before falling asleep and it was completely fine. Breakfast was decent, typical cereals/fruit/muffins/pastries/hot food. Location is absolutely perfect! A minute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s walk to Darling Harbour and Chinatown, where we had dinner, Paddy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Market where we went for a wander, and the next day it was a great starting point to see the sights. We were able to leave our entire luggage at the hotel all day until we could pick it up on the way to the airport that night. When we returned, the concierge went up to the street to get us a taxi and we were on our way. If we go back to Sydney anytime soon we will definitely be staying here.

I booked through the Accor/Novotel website & their prices were cheaper or the same as the late booking sites but included breakfast buffet (which was very nice) for both days which Wotif etc didn't. I notice another reviewer commented on the odd light switch situation. There is one switch near the door that turns on all of the lights in the room and the bathroom and no other obvious switches in either bed or bathroom so it seems you have to turn on every light during the night. There is however a full set of switches in the bedroom that control all of the lights including the bathroom.

It is located at the end of Darling Harbour, simply walk out the main door, turn right, and you are then at the end of Darling Harbour area right next to the Chinese Gardens. Although there are major streets around the hotel there are no streets you have to cross to get to Darling Harbour, which is a real bonus. Also a real plus is that the monorail has a terminal just over the road in China town (see photos) so if you want to go to town and are foot sore it is so easy to catch the monorail (we bought a day pass which was good fun as it does a complete circuit and one comes along every 3-5 minutes...so very convenient!!). The monorail also goes to Darling Harbour (the loop only goes one way- from China town onto Sydney centre and then onto to Darling Harbour). The accommodation was very good and we were able, at night, to walk to Lyric Theatre at Star City to see Priscilla (musical)- which was such excellent entertainment. So to sum it all up: location was excellent, breakfast included (which was most acceptable- served in the restaurant on the ground floor at Ceezans), room was very clean and bed was good.(plus there was an extra blanket for those cold nights). There is also free internet for house guests- just need to get passwords from reception...great way to keep in contact with those at home. We ate at Darling Harbour one night at Ice Cube which is a seafood restaurant...the staff were most attentive, food came at a good pace, the meal and the wine was delightful and the view was a million dollars- we had such a lovely day!
