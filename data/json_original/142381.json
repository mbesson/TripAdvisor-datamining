Perhaps it was the fact that we went on Easter that made our experience less than ideal. We arrived about 15 minutes before our appointment and it was very crowded so we (my husband and I) were invited to wait out front, which is basically the parking lot. At one point a huge group with no reservations but many screaming, ill-behaved children in tow showed up and after a quite a while were told they couldn't be accommodated at which point a lot of screaming about discrimination against children ensued. They weren't being discriminated against but it did raise the legal question of whether being self-entitled and annoying is a protected class. The mud baths are state of the art circa 1905. Lots of old streaky tile and pipes. I didn't love the experience but that's my issue, not the place's fault. You sort of lay on top of thick goopy hot mud and then are covered with it. You don't really sink into the tub because it's so viscous. Some people would love this. The spartan relaxation rooms are nice with the cucumbers for your eyes but the hall traffic is kind of loud. These were built for a time when people were quieter in places like this, not shrieking to their friends four rooms over about OMG, the mud is so like muddy. We both had 25 minute massages, which at $70 are pricey. Mine (done by Nicole) was very good, my husband thought his was at the lower end of the scale. The Buddha pond is another throwback in time; it has a sort of classic 50s desert / mini-golf design feel though the flock of plastic pink flamingos are an out of place trope (too 80s) that send it from hip nostalgia to kitch. We fled back to our uberluxe resort. I think the way to have a great time here would be to go on a slow day, put your best hipster outfit on and experience it as irony or nostalgia. Unfortunately, a few glasses of wine before the mud baths are a bad idea and to be avoided on health grounds; otherwise they would be a big help.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern California", "Title": "\u201cDelightful\u201d", "Author": "Von_Shmavid", "ReviewID": "UR126758897", "Content": "I don't have any problem with the reservation policy that a few other users seem to have, and I'm only vaguely aware of how much it cost to stay here since my wife took me for my birthday and paid the bill, but I can tell you I was thoroughly delighted with the grounds, the room, and the extremely warm swimming pool. The grounds have a very early 20th century Hollywoodish feeling, with palm trees, bocce ball and croquet in the front of the cottage area, and glorious white buildings and giant \"The Pool\" sign. The column of steam coming up from behind the pool all day is magical. I LOVE croquet, so my wife and I spent a lot of time out there. We tried out the clay tennis court, too, which was fun. The cottage we had was quite small but charming and comfortable. Though we worried the loudmouths next door were going to become a problem as it got later, they quieted down fairly early, and noise was not an issue at all. We did not try the mud baths but did thoroughly enjoy the large heated pool, especially on that cold January night. The poolside fireplace was great.

We had previously stayed in one of the quaint little cottages before the lodge section was built. We arrived Fri. kind of late and were given a room upstairs in the lodge section where several new rooms have been built. From the moment we pulled into this property I knew we were in for a very special time of rest and relaxation. Our room was just beautiful with a very, very comfy bed that was soft with lots of fluffy pillows. Robes, a balcony, very pretty bathroom with a gorgeous walk-in shower were all so nice! Some new fountains have been added since our last stay and they also have a beautiful terrace room where you can have morning coffee and read the newspapers by the fireplace. The real highlight of this property is the mineral water pool that just delightful to float in. It is huge and perfectly heated. After our dinner at Solbar @ Solage (which is right around the corner) we came back to the pool and floated till almost 11:00. It is open until midnight for resort guests..... so therapeutic and relaxing! We slept very well and went to the terrace rrom for coffee. Breakfast is not included which is too bad. Some fresh fruit, muffins and juice would be a very nice touch, especially on the weekends when the rates are higher. We relaxed around the pool some more and then checked out to go to All Seasons Cafe for lunch before the mud bath. When we arrived on Fri. there was some construction noise going on which did go on after 5:00 and we said it was bothersome we were given complimentary pool passes for 4 people for future use. The new pool will be adults only and will be solar-heated and cooler by 10 degrees from the exisiting pool. Indian Springs Resort is kind of rustic and back in time. You will leave here feeling very refreshed and relaxed. We were very happy with our time here and can't wait to return again in the future. I highly recommend this resort for those coming to Calistoga for refreshment. The front desk clerk was also very helpful when we asked for complimentary tasting passes in the area. :)", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rancho Santa Fe, California", "Title": "\u201cPerfect place to stay\u201d", "Author": "drbw2", "ReviewID": "UR124500114", "Content": "Indian Springs is one of our favorite place to stay -Anywhere- It very quite- Has really nice old cottages with kitchens or totally restored very well done rooms in the \"lodge\".

Awesome,except that the MAIN ATTRACTION is the olympic sized swimming pool and should be reserved for adults (which is sometimes overrun with children). Previous complaints indicate that children have ruined experiences and stays - and some suggest that IS should decide whether it is a spa destination or family destination and I agree. While I love this place, it simply offers very little for children (except the swimming pool), plus ALL SPA SERVICES are for adults. Children that are old enough to be in the pool area and make a ruckus (because let's face it, that's what kids do, they have fun and it is more often than not, loud) cannot get massages, take a mineral bath, take a mud bath, get a massage, etc. Furtermore, I doubt children feel that the need a \"spa day to get away from it all\".", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "austin,tx", "Title": "\u201cwish I had a longer stay!\u201d", "Author": "margone", "ReviewID": "UR123717932", "Content": "What a fabulous resort in the heart of downtown Calistoga.

The Resort has been around more or less since the 1860s, sitting atop a geyser that feeds an Olympic-sized pool with warm mineral spring water. It isn't dressed up fancy like Solage or Calistoga Ranch (where I've stayed before), but then you aren't paying the price either, and the spa services you get are equal to or better. First, there's the pool. Huge, warm (around 100 degrees F) open about 18 hours per day, it was fantastic to grab a float and just lounge and feel your muscles relax. There were plenty of towels and lounge chairs to catch the sun on, and a nice little office to grab refreshment (non-alcoholic) if you want. The geyser sits just behind the pool area spewing steam into the sky, and is quite dramatic at night, as is the pool itself this time of year, the steam wafting into the cold, dry air. Second, the spa. It has the traditional Calistoga mud-bath (male and female division) which is fine if you want it. It has an oddly shaped steam room. But what made it was my massage, which was excellent, beyond that really. A middle-aged woman named Marsha gave me the best deep-tissue massage I've ever received at a spa. I'd recommend asking for her by name if you want someone to get into those knots in your shoulder and back, I mean really, really get into them. Third, the whole ambience. The place is a throwback to the 1950s, with shuffle board, bocce ball, palm trees, a lawn checkers. The cabins are simple white clapboard. The spa building and the pool are obviously from sometime around the 1930s, and still retain that historic feel. The Lodge building is set away from the cabins and out towards the road and looks newer, as do the interiors. The rooms are simple, though with style, and despite worries about road noise there was none during the night (the place dies around 10), though traffic began to pick up around 7. Still, we didn't straggle out of bed until 9. The cabins have bedrooms, kitchens, living rooms and a bathroom, all nicely done. If you are staying more than two nights, or even two nights, I'd recommend them. The living rooms (a friend stayed in one) are big enough for a couple to hang-out and relax and the kitchen allows you to eat breakfast in. The town begins about two blocks from the hotel. There are ample dining options within walking distance, two or three good local coffee houses. It didn't bother me that the hotel did not serve meals. Instead I felt the hotel acted as a good neighbor, drawing people to the town for the overall benefit of the place. If you don't stay you can still go get a massage and have access to the pool. If you want to dip your toe into the place before staying there, I'd recommend that route. Beware, there is no fitness center or room service.

I would also like the TV to be in the living room, not both bedrooms. (that's personal preference!~) In the future I do not want to go to there unless it is a bit cool outside. With 100+ you can't really go outside during the day. The pool is open 6 am to 12 midnight so early and late are the only times you can go if it is very sunny and hot during the day. Also, I wish the pool had some areas with shade as it was so sunny. Besides that though, the pool is amazing. It is huge and lovely heated hot springs water and they have floating bed foams and noodles so you can just relax totally and float around. The staff are all friendly and nice. The spa is nice and lovely atmosphere.

I have to say that when you look at the reviews they're a little mixed and I think I understand why. So what's good, well, this place appeals enormously to a lot of people. It's charming and old fashioned, old school in a Martha Stewart meets modern country kind of way. It's low key and not pretentious which can be hard to find in Napa. The mineral pool is fantastic, I really enjoyed lazing around even in the July heat and the winter special with two free mud bath treatments is an amazing value. So why doesn't it appeal to everyone? Well like the rest or Napa it's quite pricey and if you like to get a lot of service for you money you won't find it here, no breakfast included though they do have free wifi. The pool is lovely but there's no drinks service, just a small amenities area as you come in where you can buy a few things. Overall: This is a great place for those who are happy to spend their money on an old fashioned (though updated) California experience. It's best for those who aren't too demanding and who may be traveling with friends or family - as they have several two bed cottages. Great if you want to cook or bbq as the cottages have small kitchens. The pool is the attraction here so if you're not bothered but the mineral springs go elsewhere. I go because my friend loves it.

Then it took several minutes to find times to accommodate my package. Then the gal mentioned that since I was booking for the next day, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cancel without paying for their 24-hour cancellation policy. but I was booking for two days away. When she realized her mistake, it was several more minutes and more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negotiating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a time slot. Two days later, morning of spa day,when I got there, I was informed that they have a special \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spa time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meaning they start their appointments deliberately 15 minutes late. Think the booking clerk could have mentioned it when I booked? So now I am giving them my credit card info, with 45 minutes to spare before my appointment. Then the desk clerk informs me that I can only have a robe if I give them my driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s license. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean show it to them. GIVE IT TO THEM IN EXCHANGE FOR A ROBE. When I balked, I was rudely informed that they had lost too many robes and without forking over my license, I could have a large towel instead. Nice way to treat a guest. Lie about the start time so the spa won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be inconvenienced if I was a few minutes late and then accuse me of potential thievery. Then I am told to have a seat in the lobby and they will call me. No offer to go to a nice relaxation area. Instead I got to sit in a cramped waiting area that was so close to the restroom (with no fan) that I could smell poop. Nothing like the refreshing smell of poop and lavender to get one in a spa mood. They have a relaxation garden, but not only was it unavailable until I was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inside,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it is closed on Tuesdays. No discount for that. SO, after waiting 55 MINUTES \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on top of the deliberate 15 minutes, they were an additional 10 minutes late, I was herded into the locker room with another guest. In the locker room the attendant handed the guest a bundle with a robe and slippers. She started to hand one to me but then snapped it back and real loud in front of every one, she announces, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, YOU don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get one.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Okay, but no slippers? Then she hands me a towel. It was unseasonably cold that day and no heat was on. After I pitched a complete hissy fit they begrudingly brought me slippers. So now I am sitting in the locker room, freezing and naked in a large towel waiting -- yes, still waiting. The other guest mentioned something about bringing a cap because she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to get her hair muddy. I asked if they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide something to cover hair. She said no. HUH??? No robe, begging for slippers, having to get my own hair cover, sitting there freezing, and having to WAIT some more. About ten minutes later the other guest and I were ushered into the mud room. OMG, Fricking gross. The mud is like glue. As I was lying there feeling the sweat and the toxins leaving my body and entering the mud, I had the horrible thought of how many other people had been detoxing in that same mud before me. Just as I was at least starting to relax, loud hammering started on a wall about three feet from me. It went on and on and on. I finally asked the mud gal about it and she immediately went to the manager. After several minutes, they got the hammering to stop. I am heaved out of the mud (giant sucking sound, pretty funny actually) and shown the shower. In the shower, the only soap for bathing was MINT soap. Washing my warmed up genitals with mint soap was far more fun than I wanted to have. THEN into the steam room for a major sweat Then into a room to be wrapped in a warm blanket and to sweat some more. Then off to the massage, which was okay, but the therapist used this oil that was very sticky. Sweat plus sticky massage oil--yummy. Oh, and she rubbed it all in my hair, too. But since it turns out they don't have showers in the locker rooms for after massage cleaning, the closest thing I got to a shower was having a quick wash in the poop-stinky lobby restroom with \u00e2\u20ac\u201c tada \u00e2\u20ac\u201c MINT soap. After the so-so massage, when the therapist was rushing away, I stopped her long enough to ask where the showers were. I was told I could either go back into the mud room and use the muddy showers OR I could go across the parking lot to shower at the swimming pool. GREAT. Take my flight bag, my purse, and my flapping towel and schlep naked rear across the parking lot trying to drag my stuff AND keep covered with just a towel. THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!!

Never were we asked to put on robes and relax, feel free to take a tour, go to the pool, or relax by the Buddha Pond. A couple minutes turned into 30-40 minutes of us waiting out front in the heat.

All of us were looking at one another as if we were in a drill and had to do it then. After a 5 minute wait we were handed keys and told our robes were in the closet. Mine did not work and the girl was very rude to me in getting me a new key and had me wait another 5 minutes on top of that, and yes the keys were in her hand too. It should have been simple. Once I was dressed and taking deep breaths to calm down, I tried to remember I was in a spa and this was supossed to be relaxing... I then asked for a bathroom which 3 of the 5 were not working and had to use the mens locker room because of the lines in the womens. My boyfriend had asked for a female and myself a male which they got those mixed up which again wasn't a big deal but we had called 2 weeks before and confirmed it again once we arrived. My massage therapist was wonderful and the facial was okay depending on how you enjoy your facials ( I recommed Calistoga Goddess for the facials, she was very very nice and extremely knowledgable). Once we were set to leave we looked at the clocks and they had set their clocks back 20 minutes everywhere.

I arrived an hour early to relax and enjoy the Budha pond. When I went to check in I was told I was free to use the pool (which I had already done for 2 days since I was staying at the resort as well). When I asked if I could sit by the Budha pond instead, the lady working at the counter seemed a bit annoyed and told me I needed to go change into my robe because only robes were allowed at the Budha Pond. I was also told that usually the Budha Pond was for after your treatment, but that she would take me back there. I felt so embarrassed and uncomfortable for asking that I just went to the pool instead. If you don't want people going to the Budha Pond before their treatments, then take it out of the brochure. I came back to the spa 10 minutes prior to my mud bath so I could get into the \"spa mood\".

The woman interrogated me asking who took me back to the locker room explaining my ticket was placed in the wrong queue while disrobing me leaving me completely naked in an open room of other spa guests and workers all the while not explaining the procedure for the whole \"relaxing\" mud bath experience. I was then rushed through my mud bath/mineral bath and only given a few minutes to rest before my massage therapist came to get me. My massage ended right on time...so what happened to the 30 minutes of lost spa time? The thing that made the whole experience even more upsetting is that when I checked out with my almost $1000 bill, no one asked me how my stay had gone. Even when I asked if they had a comment card, the hotel staff still didn't ask if something was wrong. When I tried to speak to the spa manager they asked if I could wait an hour until she got in for the day at 12 noon. I chose to fill out a comment card, which of course got no response. I have tried to call and email indian springs. I still have gotten no response. I'm sad to report that these events sort of ruined my whole experience of Calistoga.

This review is partially for people who have stayed in the cottages and are thinking of staying in the lodge and partially for the owners to make a few adjustments. So to be brief, Indian springs opened up a new wing a few years ago which is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclodge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always stayed in the cottages and absolutely love the place. I booked at short notice and could not get into the cottages so thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d give the lodge a whirl. Unfortunately it does not compare to the cottages and I do think the price is high for the amenities delivered. The main problems are; 1. If you stay on the top floor there is a wooden walkway on either side of your room and people walk along at all hours, which can be rather annoying. 2. The rooms have an opaque glass door in the bedroom so forget laying in bed 3. The quant and quirky attraction of Indian springs does not translate into the lodge 4. It is rather remote form the main facility so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a trek to the pool or the spa. Net/Net, if you stay at Indian springs, try for the cottages are this will guarantee a wonderful stay, if not, stay on the ground floor of the lodge and if all else fails, stay on the top floor and follow my pictorial of how to build a DIY blind for the opaque door. Again, please don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take this as a warning of the hotel, we love it, but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in he cottages, keep to the cottages. To the owners \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Block off the far side deck to make individual balconies off the bedrooms, put in solid doors, drop the price more for the lodge as the gap is not representative and put up some trees so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look over a Laundromat", "Date": "May 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Rafael, California", "Title": "\u201cNot Relaxing\u201d", "Author": "babs1975", "ReviewID": "UR15674202", "Content": "Massage: It was fine except for all the noise going on because the rooms are more like partitions and you can hear what is going on in all the other rooms.

The manager, Debbie, was completely unsympathetic and even insinuated that I was lying about being sick! They absolutely refused to refund any of the money because of their policy.

I started with Indian Springs, as it was recommended by a local. I arrived an hour early so I could take advantage of the thermal pool. It was wonderful as I floated in an olympic size pool filled with hot, hot water. I was not given a robe, so I had to get dressed to make the trip across the parking lot to the spa entrance. I waited with another guest & was taken to the locker room by an attendant who gave us both a flannel blanket & told to undress & wrap ourselves in the blanket. We waited at least 10 minutes past our appt time for the attendant to return. She asked us to follow her, but when I asked for slippers, I was told \"no need\". The other guest & I joked about taking a mud bath together & we were both surprised when we were taken into a stark, cement room with several cement tubs side by side. My attendant asked for my blanket wrap & helped me into the tub filled with hot, thick, black mud. (while I am not a prude, I was rendered naked at the door & had to walk to the tub in front of the other guest & 3 other attendants-unnerving). You don't sink into the mud-it's too thick, so the girl had to scoop mud from the tub & plop it all over my body until I started to sink. It feels amazing, but I couldn't help but wonder how many people have sat in the same mud. After 10 min or so, she helped me out & instructed me to take a shower (in the open) to remove most of the mud (it gets EVERYWHERE). I was then led (naked) to a bath for a soak & nail scrubbing. My new friend sat in the tub next to me. We were then given a small hand towel & told to sit in the sauna. I couldn't help but notice the mold around the floor & the door. My neighbor came in wrapped in a towel, but I was not offered one (yes, still naked). Finally, I emerged & was wrapped in my blanket & led to a small cubicle for a rest w/ cucumbers over my eyes. This was by far the best part but lasted only a few minutes. My massage therapist arrived & asked me to follow him--out the door & down a dirt path (remember, I had no slippers). We came to a stark, simple building equipped with a massage table & not much else. There was no music, no bolster for my feet/knees, & it was bright. The massage was good, but half way through my massage, my table started to shake & then the whole building started to shake. I thought we were having an earthquake! However, my therapist informed me that the laundry room was on the other side of the wall & it was just the spin cycle on the washing machine! Unreal!! He left me to find my way back to the mud room for another shower (I still had mud in my ears) & to the locker room to get dressed. It was a strange $200 experience.

I read someone's review that the foliage was taken out. Too bad. The grounds are some of the most beautiful in Calistoga. True, the staff is bored at best and unfriendly at worst. However, the grounds, the mineral pool and all the anemities are unprecedented by any other spa in Calistoga. Maybe they will catch on to customer service? i am sorry for the new look though. The old one was more suitable and soothing to look at.", "Date": "July 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery relaxing, staff needs to be more professional, & friendly\u201d", "Author": "Jakeboy", "ReviewID": "UR5507852", "Content": "I have stayed in the bungalow twice. Very relaxing. High priced for what you get however because no treatments are included. I have also visited several times for treatments & use of the pool. I returned June 06 & noticed that they remodeled the front entrance taking out all the beautiful foilage around the front fountain, and changed the decor around the pool from the blue & white to orange & brown. I personally preferred the old colors. I too noticed the water cooler was gone. I returned, for the day, July 06 & the level of the pool was down 2 feet. It was very, very hot & the cooler was still not returned. I asked several employees what was going on with the pool & was told they were repairing pipes & the water would be replaced shortly. That was at 11:00 A.M. At 5:30 P.M. the sound of water began to be returned to the pool. There was a mere 4\"-6\" of water in the pool from the shallow end to the 6' mark. If I was staying at the hotel I would be very disappointed. I overheard several visitors regarding this matter. I had asked one employee what the problem was & she yawned & said I don't know I was just told to come up here. I had a slight coversation with the spa manager & was not thrilled with his professionalism (actually lack of). It is a beautiful, old place but the staff is very unfriendly.

They separate the men from women. But just so you know you are briefly naked in front of other people when you're getting in and out of the mud, and when you get in and out of the mineral bath before you get in the sauna. There are four mud baths, you don't have a private mud bath to yourself unless no one else is scheduled for mud bath when you are. It takes a long time to wash off the mud when you're in the shower. They serve you cold water with lemon and cucumber in the water, it tastes great. The big outside mineral pool is awesome. It's super clean and they use just a little bit of chemicals because the water is fed from the 212 degree natural spring. It was really cold when we were there about 33 degrees so there was a lot of steam coming off the water...so much steam that you couldn't see people 20 ft away, which made if very private for my girlfriend and I.

Mixed experience. Loved the old-fashioned, authentic (not hokey) architecture and decor of the spa and our cottage. Room had a Provencal-feel with distressed painted floor and furnishings. Comfortable bed, but with noisy window air conditioner that we turned off as evenings cool. Close to road, but traffic only moderate. Not for those who want back-to-nature spa experience. Attraction here is that you have a sense of authentic understated resort. Reminded me of Palm Beach in the Fifties. Palm trees, white-washed buildings, shuffle board, croquet - but all in an unpretentious way. Thermal swimming pool terrific - large enough that never felt crowded, although day-trippers are permitted. Big disappointment was the spa treatments. Two massages were [1] incomplete - extremities but not torso; and [2] not firm enough - no manipulation of muscalature, just thumping. Mud bath also was not hot. Management receptive to suggestions for improvement and provided, despite refusal, a voucher for another mud bath. Wife had a facial which she found O.K., but not exceptional. For a resort that's been operating as a spa this long, treatments should be of highest caliber. Problem is, as explained to me bt the spa manager, that the masseurs are independent contractors. Thus, the problem would appear to how to control quality. Before you book, you should ascertain who are the best masseurs.

When our names were called, we were led to their locker room where we had to remove all our clothing and wrap ourselves with a towel. To my dismay, there were no slippers so you had to walk barefoot. When we were done undressing, they led us to an open area where there were shower stalls, they removed our towel and was told to rinse right there. Everyone's just walking around naked. If you're shy, this is not for you. The good thing is men and women are in different areas. After rinsing, you are led to this big cemented tub with volcanic ash, you lay there without your towel and the attendant grabs some ash to cover you. The tubs are all beside each other so you can see the other people doing the treatment with you. After that, you head to your mineral tub, sauna, and then cool off with cucumber slices under your eyes. Overall, I felt that there were too many people and the place felt like an assembly line.

The special includes a spa treatment for two which includes mud bath, hot minearal soak in the claw foot tubs, steam and relaxing wrap with the cucumbers on the eyes. A 1/2 hr. or 1 hr. massage or facial can be added for an extra cost. The resort is a throw back to the earlier part of the century but I don't care for the upscale spas so this one is about right for me. The one bedroom bungalows which are included in the special are very clean, with kitchenettes and a pull out couch which our two boys sleep on. We meet up with another couple and the kids play in the warm pool while we get our treatments. Then we usually go out for dinner or cook up a meal on the grounds. Although I don't especially enjoy the mud baths they are relaxing and depending on the temperature that day I often doze off at one or more of the treatment stations.
