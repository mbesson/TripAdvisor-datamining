It was nice and clean but it was facing a man-made lake facing the street. The rooms had flat screen TVs and the bedrooms even had a bluray player in them. The doors were all outside corridors, like a motel, which made it very noisy. The pools were very nice but on the cooler side, which seemed odd because they were suppose to be heated. The only thing I did not like was there was no marketplace. When we thought about ordering a pizza we would have gone across the street to the other Marriott to pick it up. They did have many activities for the kids (which we didn't do because our daughter is 4). If you are going just to spend your time at the parks and just need a place to lay your head, it's very nice, but if you are expecting the Marriott high standards it's not.

The rooms are fine, though no big jacuzzi bath that all the other resorts have. The kitchen was well equiped and as a whole the place was comfortable, clean and had great TVs with HD channels. Parking was tight, but then it was spring break and the place was busy. The pools were good, in fact exceptional if you had kids with you. We didn't and missed an adult pool or somewhere that you could swim without being splashed or bombed by kids. You could say that it was us not fully researching the place I guess. There are 2 pools, but both geared for kids. The grounds were well kept, and there was a choice of 3 BBqs to use in the evening.

The hotel was decent, clean but did look older inside the rooms. There are two pools. One has a water slide and spouting play area for the kids.

The water was heated and the perfect temperature, there were features for both my 6 year old and my 2 year old so they both could play and have fun. My only complaint is as a timeshare exchange guest I felt like the messaging to me was that I was a bother to the hotel because I wouldn't purchase a Marriott timeshare while I was there. We know there is no housekeeping with timeshare guests, but this was overly emphasized to us. Immediately upon check in we were told we would receive a \"free gift,\" went to claim it and it was a disposable bag to use at the grocery store, and when claiming it I was told the gift is usually only for the Marriott owners. Of course I was asked to attend their 90 minute timeshare sales pitch, which I declined. Their users manual in the room points out that pool towels are \"checked out\" to each guest and if not returned incur a $10 fee, should you need extra bedding there is an extra fee, garbage removed = extra fee, any additional cleaning = extra free etc. etc. Instructions on the thermostat said to leave it set to 78 degrees. Even though all this was stated it was not enforced and we incurred no extra charges, but again, it's like the message they want to send is \"we know you bought a time share ans chose to stay with us, but it's just not enough.\" We stayed in a studio room with a queen bed and pull out couch. The pull out couch was not made before hand and about as comfortable to lay on as a bed of nails. I would think in a timeshare where they know families are staying they could at least throw the mattress cover and sheets on the pull out after each guest leaves. I was a little disappointed also that this hotel has no shuttle bus service to any of the Disney Parks, it clearly looked like just about every guest was going to Disney.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kitchener", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay @ Marriott Harbour Lake\u201d", "Author": "linesman10", "ReviewID": "UR126306632", "Content": "Family of 4 with 2 kids ages 3 and 6 stayed there March 11 to 18 th.

Found 2 roaches crawling around, the last one, crawling on the ceiling, was found by my kids who freaked out. Upon returning home and opening my suitcase, what to my surprise do I find but one more little \"friend\" who ran like lightning and tried to hide under my couch. Fortunately I was able to get it. We called about the pests. They offered to come in when we were out and either put boron powder or some sort of spray but they couldn't guarantee residue flying around. Not what I want my kids to breath in. While we were there they decided to power wash the halls. It was not only loud BUT the water leaked under our door and we had to put towels down to prevent it flooding into our room. Our toilets both got clogged during our stay not by our doing. They need better cookware in the cupboards, Nothing non-stick. During our stay my son had an accident at the pool and got a cut under his chin on the ledge. He had to go and get the gash glued at a local hospital. Next day they called and asked if we needed anything. What that meant was did I need \"bandaids\" in the words of the caller, but didn't seem overly concerned about the accident nor did anyone call to get any facts. The room was nice (minus the roaches and the incredibly loud bathroom fan that was stupidly connected to the light so unless you wanted to be in dim light in the bathroom you had to put on the main light with the super noisy fan) the people were nice, the gym (no free weights only machines but lots of treadmills) and pool were okay, the pool bar was good (the guys who worked there were very nice) and there was decent stuff to do and my kids had fun but I would never stay here again. Don't bother with your \"free gift\" that you have to pick up at the concierge desk (right behind you) after you check in. It's just flyers for local places, a coupon for free mini-golf, a \"free\" family photo (where they try to sell you a whole package to \"remember your vacation\") and the usual spiel/hard sell to get you to take a timeshare tour (\"We only have a few spots left so sign up right away!\") Oddly enough, most places offer you Disney tickets to waste your vacation on their sales tour, these guys offered one $75 Disney gift card. Try as we might, we couldn't finagle tickets out of them, so no tour for us. We have Disney annual passes but the family we stayed with doesn't so we offered for us to go with them if they gave them Disney passes. No luck. I say odd because you have people at 7-11's offering Disney passes for time share tours down on Irlo Bronson. If you plan to do Disney there are better choices as far as location.

This unit was far from the first. It was older, outdated and not so pretty, but it was spacious and clean and nothing to complain about. We did have some trouble with the door locking on our 2nd unit, but maitnance was helpful. The resort isn't huge, so really either place we stayed was cose enough to the pools and amenities.

Since the first week of December is one of the slower vacation times during the year in Orlando, we were able to get this villa for $ 116 per night (plus tax) -which we thought was a terrific deal considering a week or so later on the calendar, this size villa would easily cost $ 300+ per night. We spent six nights here and thought it a great place all around. Found the villa to have plenty of room, very clean, everything in working order and the location terrific. Our villa overlooked a pond then onto a road, but the complex was far enough back, as well as the road didn't get that busy that we didn't experience any road noise. We found that we were a short drive from all the main attractions in Orlando from all the Disney parks, to Universal to Gaylord (where we went to the Shrek ICE attraction) and Seaworld which was just up the road from the complex. The complex was also close to restaurants and both Walgreens and CVS were a block or two down the road along with a Publix. We found the villa and its furnishing to be recently updated so everything looked fresh. This was the second time that we stayed in a Marriott Vacation Club complex in the Orlando area with the first time being back in 2008 when we stayed in at the Marriott Grande Lakes - which was nice too - but we found that we preferred the location and layout of the Harbour Lake complex better. As for Harbour Lake's other features. My husband did have the opportunity to work out one morning in the fitness center which is said was good but we didn't have the time to check out all the other features the complex had to offer.

Our children love the pirate ship, splash park, and pirate plunge slide. We had to negotiate with them so they would agree to leave the property and go to Disney World (yes, it is that good!). The grounds, pools, and hot tubs are very well-maintained. The condo was a large 2 bedroom in building 12 which has been recently renovated. The unit was large, but corners had been cut in the updating and cleaning. The door to the fridge was installed on the wrong side so we had to walk around the fridge to open it, and then had to close it to get access to the kitchen. The dishwasher door when opened in front of the sink, so you had to lean over toprove dished from sink to dishwasher. These are minor issues, but indicative of the level of care and thought taken. The carpeted floors while tidy looking, were filthy and in desparate need of a thorough carpet cleaning. After removing our shoes, our socks became stained from the dirt with just walking around during the 2ish hours between dinner and bedtime. Knowing how dirty the floor was, made me cringe about the non-washable bedding and large pillows. I immediately put them up pn a shelf to minimize our contct with them.The washer and dryer worked well, but are small and so we used them daily. The biggest issue was that after almost a week, I found a huge cockroach near the front door. I know bugs are part of nature, and Florida has a warm climate, but I am not a bug person. In fact, I have considerable anxiety over bugs. We had not had any problem in our previous visits, and so I was shocked. You may think, \"so what, it was only a bug\". However, seeing a 2+ inch cockroach scurry across your condo floor is never a good thing. I managed to catch the in a glass container. My spouse and I then checked online and confirmed that it was in fact a cockroach. I then called the front desk, and while apologetic, they certainly were not alarmed. It turns out that cockroaches, ants, etc are a typical part of life in Florida, and in the condos. The condo units are located in a large wooded/ park like area and so the staff said it was a common challenge. They have the areas sprayed/treated every three months to minimize the problem. We had 4 more days to our visit, and the best they could offer was to move us to higher floor. We moved from 2nd floor of building 12 to the 6th floor in building 13. The manager at the front desk speculated that the lack of a door sweeper, a flexible rubber strip that gets attached to the bottom of doors to prevent light, air, and bugs from entering, was the reson for the cockraoch getting into our unit on the 2nd floor. We had no problems with bugs on the 6th floor, but I was not able to relax and was constantly checking for more bugs. Given the one large cockroach, I would not return to the property in the future and would not recommend it to my friends.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Farmington, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cOrlando with a smile\u201d", "Author": "RaysOpinion", "ReviewID": "UR121831054", "Content": "We recently stayed at Harbour Lake in Orlando (rm #1032, 2 bdrm).

I concur with all of the wonderful comments about the staff & facility, so I won't repeat them, but add some other comments. Cost - This is our third trip to the Orlando area in the 10 years. The first two times were at a Disney property; the Yacht club. I think it is important to experience Disney World from a property on Disney site \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Once! That being said, I think I spent more money staying at the Yacht club for a week then our 10-day trip to Italy! The cost of the hotel plus food, plus sacks, plus + $$$ - Expensive! Harbour Lake, like all Marriott Vacation properties, are large and come with a full kitchen, internet & plenty of room. For this trip we traded a week we have at another location for Harbour Lake so it's almost like it was free! (Almost free, until I get the $1,000 maintenance bill for my own unit realizing that it's not so free.) Our two boys are older and my wife and I are not that interested in visiting the various parks again so Marriott's Harbour Lake was perfect. Each morning I dropped our boys off at the various parks. (They all have convenient drop off areas.) My wife & I enjoyed the hotel then returned to pick up the boys, sometimes staying at Downtown Disney or Universal City Walk for dinner or a movie and sometimes heading back to the hotel. It was all very nice & relaxing. The facility is approximately half way between Universal & Disney. There are nearby stores including Wal-Mart super stores and Costco for food & drink. Location - All of the rooms are very nice. As with all of the Marriott Vacation properties, some locations are better than others. I prefer a higher room that offers more openness. Building 12 & 13 & 14 offer the best lake views, which is my favorite. Building 15 also has a nice lake view but is close to the very busy & noisy Hwy 4. Frankly, I would not fuss over the room location too much. They are all nice and unless you plan to hole up in your room the entire time, location is not that critical.

The activities they have all day long for the kids are great and the activity staff are great to the kids. The Resort is very clean and the rooms are large and most have been renovated. The staff are all so friendly and very helpful and will go out of their way to assist. There is so much to do at this Resort that you do not need to go anywhere else but if you want to Disney is only 10 minutes away, Seaworld 5 minutes and Cocoa Beach 45 minutes.

This is a very nice property in the heart of Orlando. It's unique primarily because of the two pool areas with a variety of activities associated with them (kiddie pool, water slide, fountains, etc.), bball court, mini-golf and a nice open grassy area for any outdoor activities. It also has a couple of bar/snack bar areas for easy access, and the main eating area also serves a good menu as well as Starbucks coffee. In typical Marriott fashion, the staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are very clean and comfortable, and the location is nice in that it's 2 minutes from Sea World and only 10 mins max to the other parks. We stayed in a 2 bedroom unit, which is a lot of space for a family of 4. Here's a few details about the property that you might not get elsewhere. As I always say in these reviews, these are really just designed to inform you as a reader, not meant as a complaint. For some, these details will matter a lot, while for others they may not matter much. 1. The Starbucks place opens at 7:30am. This seems late to me for those of us who get up early. 2. The hotel is not too far from Highway 4, and while the noise isn't much of an issue at all, it is very visible from the property. If being near a highway in full view matters to you, maybe ask for a room as far back as possible (keeping in mind that none of the rooms are too close to the highway at all....just visible and noticeable as part of your view). 3. Oddly, some of the sorrounding grounds on this property wasn't landscaped when we were there in Nov of 2011. Not a huge deal to be sure, but very surprising for a Marriott Property. There were a few areas that were just open dirt areas just off parking lots, etc., which seemed out of place. It made me feel like they just dropped the resort down on the open land and decided not to landscape the entire area. To be fair, they may be planning to complete this, or maybe they don't own the land and have no control (if this is the case I'd at least plant trees to hide it). 4. I found it interesting, and yes a little bit strange, that all of the buildings on this property only had one entrance (rather than a front and back entrance, or side entrance too). I understand this isn't necessarily unique, but it did seem very odd to have to come out of a building in what is considered the front, only to have to then walk all the way around the building to get to the back (where the pool area is for example, and is really the front area). I imagine this isn't a problem in all buildings, but at least in building #28 where we stayed it was notable. It's possible that they opted not to include a second way out so as to provide more room space in the building, but I think it was a mistake not to make it easier to get in/out more conveniently.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sterling, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cLoved It\u201d", "Author": "optimist333", "ReviewID": "UR121158843", "Content": "We do not own timeshares but instead booked through the hotel website.

It is just another large time share property out of the hundreds in the Orlando area. The rooms are basic cheap decor, nothing special. Each building has a elevator that looks like something from the inner city slums or a dirty service elevator. We first checked into a 1st floor in a 10 yr old building and as we openned the door we were immediately hit with a horrible body odor smell. The carpet was an ugly dark blue that appeared to be very old. I thought maybe the carpet had gotten wet and moldy. We immediately went back to the lobby to change rooms. The front desk person was annoyed with us and at first told us that there were no other rooms available, then put us in a 3 yr old building on the top floor. This room had the exact same horrible body odor smell. The room looked exactly the same as the older one, the dark blue rug looked just as old. Other than the smell everything was clean and seemed adequate and we decided to open the balcony and all the windows to air the place out. No one ever called us to ask if we were happy with the new room. We had to leave the balcony doors open the entire week even when we were out. Did not care for the cheap decor or furniture and have stayed in nicer timeshares in the Orlando area in the past. The mass construction buildings were basic just like a cheap condo complex. I can see how little kids would love the pirate ship pool but for anyone without small children there is really nothing special here. The weather was cold early November and the place was very slow when we were there. Did not use the pool. They do not have any type of store on site which is surprising.

We were not disappointed!! The only negative points that we found were that there was no on-site convenience store and the proximity to Disney. It would be nice to be able to pick up milk nearby if you run out without having to drive 15 minutes. And of course you can't beat the on-site Disney accommodations but when it is important to hit the park when it opens (much shorter line ups first thing in the morning!) we might choose to stay on site next time because of the approx 30 minutes from our door to the Magic Kingdom (after driving, getting the tram and then the monorail!). Our kids are small so Disney was our only destination but if you are going other places, Harbour Lake is close to Seaworld and International Drive with all of it's attractions. Now for the positives (and we found many!). -great pools for the kids - beautiful, newly renovated rooms - clean!! I'm not sure about all of the cleanliness or cockroach complaints! No weekly cleaning (or maybe just a midweek cleaning) is standard for all of the timeshares we have stayed in!). We didn't see a single bug in our unit all week and we found there to be plenty of supplies in our 2 bedroom 2 bathroom unit with 4 adults and 2 kids. The only thing we ran out of was laundry soap and the housekeeper was more than happy to give me more when I asked her. This place was super clean and in great shape I thought! - our air conditioner stopped working one night. Within 10 minutes of our call a maintenance person was there and after replacing the thermostat and a few other things he had it up and running again (at 11pm I think that is great service!) - tons of activities (organized activities plus the mini golf, billiards, ping pong, basketball, park, we didn't even use our entire Disney tickets because the kids were so happy playing at the resort!) - we didn't find the poor \"restaurant\" to be an issue. Part of the reason we went the time share route was so we would have our own kitchen and could cook our own healthy food. We didn't eat at the restaurant once all week. Plus you are so close to so many great dining options on international drive. - concierge was wonderful! So helpful!! Being timeshare owners they asked us to go to their owner presentation. If the 8 am one wasn't booked we probably would have went for the $100 off our Disney tickets but when it was booked up and we said \"no thanks\" we weren't asked again. Overall this place deserves a 5/5 for what it is. It is a timeshare with no daily cleaning! It's a great place to go with kids. If we weren't taking the kids I probably wouldn't choose Harbour Lake...

We had to run to the local grocery store for bread...not a big deal, but I'm guessing they could make money on a few convenience items. Now the positives. Awesome, pirate-themed pools for kids. The best hotel pools I've been to in mildly extensive travels. They almost didn't want to leave the hotel, but Disney World pulled them away. Other fun amenities included a large fire pit, onsite gas grills, sport courts with basketball hoops, neat putt-putt golf, Starbucks, nice changing rooms by the pool, a very nice Boardwalk, quiet and safe location, decent restaurant/grille near the pools, NFL Sunday Ticket with 4 tv's by the pool (my Lions were playing), full schedule of events by the pool, and good service.

The units are large, clean and well equipped. There was a stackable washer and dryer in the unit. The kitchen had stainless steel appliances. Beginning supplies of trash bags, laundry and dish detergent, soaps, shampoos etc. all supplied. Free wifi. Slept very well during our week here. Really a gorgeous condo -- I believe the square footage was 1,200-square feet. The check-in process was quick and we were never asked to attend a timeshare presentation. I also loved the fact that there were all kinds of activities going on during the week. We were given a schedule ahead of time so we could plan. Also, there was an automated call (never rang to intrude upon your vacation time but only a flashing message light) to tell you about the weather forecast for the next day as well as any special activities. We roasted smores around the firepit with a guitarist playing; also fished with cane poles, swam, laid out, never did get to play mini golf because I thought it was $25 a person for the week but that turned out to be wrong -- it was $25 for the whole week for UP TO FOUR PEOPLE in a unit! The pools, water park and slides were all in great working order. You never saw trash laying around. Very well kept property. We also grilled out several nights though some of the starters had gone out on the grills. They did supply firestarters though. There was Hawaiian night with a luau and band, Italian night, wine and cheese parties, a great sport court (two separate), ping pong and billiards tables. Also, the resort felt very secure. The beds were extremely comfortable; the bathrooms spacious. There were nine of us ranging from 9 months to 66 years and we all had a wonderful time. While most of the day was spent in disneyworld, if we had to do it over again, we would have spent more time at the wonderful pool at the resort. The kids LOVED it.

They also have lots of activities for kids - we did water balloons and a magic show. Our hotel room was spacious with 2 bedrooms, living area, dining table and large kitchen. It was also great to have a washer and dryer. It was right around the corner from SeaWorld and Discover Cove and only 10 minutes from Disney. Discovery Cove was awesome (even on a cool day). We also drove to New Smyrna beach and drove on the beach. On the way to New Smyrna beach we went to Zoom Air and did a ropes course through the trees and a zip line. Our boys LOVED it!

We had a 2 bedroom unit on the 4th floor that faced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Horizons Harbour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, one of the two themed kiddy pool/pool areas. The other area is called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pirate Plunge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and has a pirate ship with water slides off of it. The pool areas were great and a lot of fun for kids and adults alike. They had a nice playground area near the Horizon Harbour area with two basketball courts, pool tables, ping pong tables, large play set with slides, and a fire pit/sitting area. There are also two different areas to get drinks and food by the pools. On to the unit itself; it is spacious for what it is with a nice screened in balcony with table and chairs. The bedrooms and living room had LCD HD TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with plenty of satellite channels to choose from. There is a BluRay player in the living room. Typical Marriott vacation club amenities were present in the villa including washer/dryer combo and full kitchen with dishwasher. Free Wi-Fi in all the villas as well.

Overall, I highly recommend it for families with kids due to the various amenities on site that can keep kids busy for hours. They also have a game room that is near the pirate plunge pool area.

They should have a sign or a PERSON informing you BEFORE you send your kids on the slide, that HEIGHT isnt the only requirement, but that if they aren't strong swimmers, then need an adult in the pool to help them when they come off the slide! The kids loved the slide though and continued to get back on it repeatedly, with me in the water to help them after that!

One of the dresser drawers in the master bedroom was broken and the porcelain was peeling off the sink. But overall, it was clean and very spacious.

We had 8 people and the girls usually need two towels each - one for hair and one for body. And 4 washcloths for 8 people for a week??!

The dishwasher and washer/dryer came in handy. there was a a large screen TV with Blu-ray player. Free WiFi was quite fast and reliable. The staff were remarkably friendly and helpful, in a low-key and genuine way. As an example, I dropped my wallet while inserting the security pass to re-enter the resort and the gate attendant noticed it and retrieved it for me. I would have driven away unawares, sans wallet. When I tried to give him a tip later he refused, saying it was just his job, before I finally persuaded him to take it to make me feel better. There was one polite telephone solicitation to attend a session on buying a time-share, with an offer to subsidize our park tickets as an incentive to attend, which we ignored. The concierge booked all of our Disney tickets cheerfully and efficiently. There are extensive recreation programs, with things like Polynesian nights and surfing lessons. We were too busy at the parks to go to them, but they would be fun if you were hanging around the resort more. The two pools were clean and well laid out. One has a water slide and spray park, with snack bar, and the other is larger, with a pirate ship for playing on and a bigger swimming area for adults, plus a full bar and grill. Our bits (10 and 12) loved the pirate theme and did not find the slide too tame, but perhaps older teenagers would. Plenty of pool seating was available. There is also a full video arcade and what looked like a well set up workout room. We also found the location to be very convenient for visiting the theme parks. The distances on the map are deceptive because this resort is very close to I-4, which means a fast easy drive to the WDW parks - maybe 15 minutes maximum - with hardly any stops on the way. Universal is even closer and Sea World is closer still. There is a Publix grocery store and 24-hour Walgreen's drug store on I-Drive about 5 minutes away. We had a rental car (which I highly recommend) so I can't comment on the availability of shuttle transport to the various parks. If your kids start school after Labour Day and you can stand the heat (high of 94 degrees and 80% humidity most days!) , the end of August is a nice time to go without taking them out of school, because Florida kids go back the third week in August and the parks are quieter.

We left the Marriott to stay at a WDW value property and our kids kept wanting to go back to the Marriott.

We are owners at the resort and have been here twice before. We were traveling with our friends who also own here. We have a 13 year old daughter and they have a 13 year old daughter as well and an 18 year old son. I tell you this because the kids had even more fun at the resort this time than when they had all been the previous two times. We would have thought that they might be bored but they never were! We actually spent four full days just at the resort. Check in was very quick and we were able to get into our Villa early. Our 2 bedroom villa was located in Building 28 (Buried Treasure) in Room 2853 on the fifth floor overlooking the water park. We stayed in the same building on our last visit a few years ago and the villa had been brand new then. It was recently revamped with a flat screen TV and new d\u00c3\u00a9cor. The room is very comfortable for a family of six and was very clean. The kitchen offers everything that you would need to cook any meal. The porch is screened with a table and 4 chairs in which is very nice. We sat out there every evening to enjoy the fireworks at Disney. Harbour Lake is very close to SeaWorld and Aquatica Water Park as well as International Drive, Universal and Disney. There are lots of great shops/outlets and restaurants in the area. After checking in, we went to the nearby Costco and Publix to get supplies for the week. It is nice to be able to cook some meals for dinner and to have breakfast each morning in the room. When we were at the resort during the day, we would be able to eat lunch as well. Eating in certainly reduces the cost of the vacation\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6especially when you have kids with you. The kids love the resort because they are able to go off safely on their own to do all of the activities. On property, there are two great pools\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6one with a water slide with a zero entry pool and the other has a pirate ship to play on. Both pool areas have hot tubs. There were kids playing in the small waterpark all of the time. There is a great mini-golf course and a sports area that has a basketball court, 2 ping pong tables and a foosball table as well as a soccer field across the street. The campfire is in that area as well as the gas grills. We used them one night to cook our dinner. There is also a Kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Club that is available for younger children. Our kids used to use it and loved all of the activities, but they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t this time since they were older. The HarborSide Bar & Grill by the Pirate Plunge pool has been recently redone and they offer some good food. The girls each bought a drink mug at the beginning of our stay so that they could get free refills all week. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is a great value. We also took advantage of the ice cream social every afternoon. There are lots of activities that the resort offers. Some have a fee but others don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6there is an Activity Schedule that lists everything that is going on. The pool party by the Pirate pool was a great activity and offered live music. Everyone that we encountered who worked there was very friendly and professional. There is a Concierge desk if you need help with your travel plans and I was able to print my boarding passes off at the computer in the lobby. We did not have any cleanings during the week, but you can arrange to have your villa cleaned or just have the towels exchanged for a fee. This is technically not a hotel, but a Time Share, so they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer free daily cleaning. This resort is a great choice for families with kids of all ages.

We chose this resort because of the pool areas and our kids loved them! There were more activities than we had time (or energy) to participate in. Other than the pools, the only things we took advantage of was the poolside bar & grill, we rented movies from the rec room, and played a Texas Hold 'Em tournament one night as one of the planned activities - no money involved, of course, but fun. One very handy amenity was the on site concierge from whom we purchased all our park tickets. Calling around I found their ticket prices to be equal to, or slightly cheaper than buying at the park gates, but MUCH more convenient. They were there 7 days/wk 8am-8pm. There was no room cleaning service (although available for an additional charge) but we didn't mind.

The pools are very kid friendly with zero entries and shallowness so that even non-swimmers can enjoy the wonderful slides and water features with more independence. My 8 year old is not a strong swimmer and is scared of deep water. However, for the large pirate pluge slide, the water at that end of the pool was shallow enough that he was able to enjoy this slide without needing us to catch him.

Everyone else managed fine though so it might just have been me! The whole resort was immaculately kept and I loved the fact that they made Starbucks coffee on site! We used the pool and hot tubs a few times, but generally at times when there weren't loads of kids around - just our preference. Because of going to Disney and Universal and also because we were there for a wedding, we didn't join in any of the resort activities though they seemed to have a good selection.

We were given 2 choices for a one bedroom. A 2nd floor new (less than 2 years) unit near the main pool and a 4th floor unit that had been recently refurbished located overlooking the slide at the 'other' pool. The check-in person had zero personality and would not really commit to which location or unit was preferable (road noise/location in the property/size of new unit vs. the refurb, etc.) and believe me we tried to get her help. We decided on the refurb unit that was located in bldg 28, room 46. Mainly, because it appeared to be farther from I-4 and its accompanying road noise. The road noise was minimal but please be aware that this resort is located adjacent to the interstate. With some bldgs being somewhat closer than the others to the road. Unit was in very good shape. Quite large living/dining room area. TVs are not HD and the unit in the living area is a large floor box type set. Plenty of channels (not that we were there to watch TV). Patio was nicely screened in variety. Master bedroom was a little small but the bathroom was a nice size. The bed was above average in comfort but the pillows were beyond bad. The washer and dryer was put to good use. The dishes, glasses, towel situation, dishwasher, etc were all excellent. We received service everyday. I left a daily tip, not sure if this made a difference or not. On Monday, we did return about 3:00 pm and the room had not been touched. I called the front deslk and was connected to house-keeping. We left for the evening and upon on our return we had about 8 towels and wash clothes. It was almost funny. Everyday after that we had product coming our of our ears. The room was completely serviced ie., beds made, trash emptied, shampoo and soap replenished. The 'secondary' pool was very nice. The kids enjoyed the slide and the hot tub on 2 occasions. This was primarily a park stoming trip so we spent very little time at the resort. Kids did play some of the games provided. And on Saturday evening upon our arrival the lady overseeing the putt- putt let them play for free. It was, I believe $25 for the length of your stay or $5 a round. Another evening they inquired about playing and the person there told them the costs. We found out about this later, but, again, we just did not really spend a ton of time at the resort. The front guards were very much on the ball, they always greeted us even though we used our cards to access the property at the gate away from their guard bldg. No matter the time of day (and believe me we got back after midnight a couple of times) you got a friendly smile and wave. Security is a good thing. They were really on the ball. We had interaction with a couple of the house-keepers when we were arriving on Saturday and they were very friendly. Odd that the front desk person was so blah but the other people we encountered were great. Joanne at the pool was very nice and friendly making sure wer had plenty of pool towels.We observed her asking a group of 'mental giant' adults if she could get them some paper cups for their beers that they had setting on the pool deck around the hot tub in glass bottles. She handled it great. You would think that the giant letters on the rules advising of no glass at the pool would have been a clue but not to these geniuses. No matter Joanne solved the problem. We were not really bothered by any sales folks. We were told that we had a free photo session upon check-in and there was one message left later in the week reminding us of this but we had no interest. No other calls were received, if there had been we would have just politely declined. We have stayed at several Marriott properties in the Hilton Head Island area. It is a quick jaunt down from Greenville, SC for us. We always pay cash. We are DVC owners with HHI as our home resort. This was a relatively last minute trip...decided in October so we just couldn't hook up on a DVC resort. We paid $149 a night, with taxes it came to around $850 for the 5 nights. We felt that the quality of the accomodations were a very good value. The trip to the parks is a breeze from this location. You hang a left out of the resort go less than a mile, take a left and you jump on the interstate and in 2 exits you are exiting to most things Disney. Coming back was just as easy. We did miss the Disney resort 'magic' but, again, we spent so little time in our unit that it did not make that a big thing. We still visited some of the Disney resorts for various things. Even rode the buses and the monorail on a couple of occastions. This was the 1st time in years that I had spent money to park at the parks.($14 a day, ouch). We did head over to Disney's Old Key West Resort on Thursday morning after check-out. My brother had a studio for us to use (we did not even sleep in the room, leaving Orlando around 5:00PM getting home around 1:15AM on Friday morning). We were able to get right into a room by taking a handicapped room. It was a nice wrap-up to our trip.The Disney pool was much warmer than the heated Marriott pool.

First, the 2 bedroom villas are smaller than typical villas at other Marriott VCs (about 75% of the typical room), still plenty of room but we were a little disappointed upon first impression, also, the patio is screened in and bland, but the unit was clean and had all the other amenities. The TVs don't have HD. I do have to say though that the staff was very good, the activities by the pool on a daily basis were run very well and entertaining for children aged 4-11. Also we have a 3 year old and the pools were great for young children. Our kids got tired of the splash area and pirate ship after the first day, however, the zero depth pool allowed my wife and I to enjoy relaxing in lounge chairs by the pool watching our 3 year old from a short distance, so that was very nice. Also, the pools were heated to 84 degrees which was great as this can make or break swimming for kids. So here is the skinny - the rooms are average (relative to Marriott VC standards), but the pool is great if you have very young children.

Chose this resort out of a few because it got good tripadvisor reviews (and no cockroaches, which I heard were problems in other orlando area resorts). This resort was perfect. It was just my sister and I in a studio room. It was 2.5 times the size of the Disney Value hotel we stayed at for one night we were in orlando. The room is clean and spacious. Had a nice balcony where you could sit at a table with screens to keep out pests and a fan for hot humid days. Didn't have a big kitchen just a microwave and fridge but that worked out since we spent every day in the theme parks. Had enough closet and drawer space for 2 L.A. girls and all our tons of clothes. It was nice to have the living room and dining table to hang at after days of walking through the parks. The only 2 things that bothered me about our awesome room were 1. the bed. I am a heavy sleeper and can sleep most anywhere (even on airplanes somtimes) but somehow the bed was not that great. It wasn't uncomfortable per se but something about it took me hours to fall asleep even after spending 9+ hours walking in the sun at walt disney world. Also, the walls are paper thin. We were in the front of the resort and heard cars coming in and crossing the bridge loudly. Could definitely hear kids running and shouting above and below us late at night or early in the morning. Other than that (which was tolerable) the room was great and a nice place to get away from the disney crowds and relax. The jacuzzis were nice after walking so much. The pools are cool and have slides, a pirate ship!!!!, and other water splashing things that are VERY fun for kids. So fun that kids were there all the way till pool close at 11pm running around. Did not spend alot of time at the resort besides in the room but we did see lots of activities, like ice cream and karaoke. But I noticed there was not alot to do for young adults like us unless you're with family. Just a few pool tables :/ Did not eat at the pool bar but it was decently priced with lots of drinks! It looked good. Close proximity to grocery store and OUTLET shopping! These outlets were open late (11pm) and always busy. Not far and very conveniently located from the theme parks (universal and disney) Lots of tasty food around also.

We loved CH's quality, amenities, kids programming, and value. The only reason we stayed at HL this year instead of CH was HL's top rating for kids on this site, which we found to be justied. At both properties we stayed in one of the two-bed, two-bath units with both of our young children. Overall everything was excellent, with superior accomodations, spacious and well thought-out units and beautiful pools and grounds. While similar, we liked the Harbour Lake (HL) rooms slightly better than Cypress Harbour (CH), even though the CH struck us as slightly newer. Both are very spacious, with three TVs, screened-in porch, separate TV and eating areas, large (for a condo) kitchens, and washer/dryer. HL layout was better b/c 2nd bathroom connected to foyer area, which provides a powder room for guest access, and it had a corner-banquette instead of a free-standing dining room table that used the space better. CH master bath felt more spacious--doublesinks are always nice, as did the porch (octagonal- vs. rectangular at HL). CH feels more tropical and secluded than HL due to its more lush, tree-heavy landscaping. Biggest difference: While CH was great for kids, the pools at HL really set it apart--great water slide, great kiddie pool/jet play areas, pirate ship, etc. Location is great for both properties (across the street from one another)--easy (driving) access to everything, right off I-4 and a couple exits to all the Disney properties, within a mile of Sea World, high end outlet mall shopping, and International Drive with its numerous restaurants and other retail options. HL pros/cons: Liked best: Service ultimately came shining through, as evidenced by the near-immediate response we received to fix the porch sliding door which came off its track. Kids pools were great, and structured events were well received. Liked least: Check-in was not smooth, requiring 25 minutes to finally get sorted.

We were two adults and one twelve year old boy travelling from the UK. We stayed the last week of July and the first week of August in a two bedroom villa. The rooms are massive by European standards. The rooms are very clean and indeed the whole resort is spotless. Perhaps it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the American attention to detail but everything worked. The barbeques have the gas on a direct feed, no bottles to run out, and they work. Every morning they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re cleaned by high pressure hose and are spotless for the next person. When we were there it certainly wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t packed and you could easily get a sun lounger. The staff are friendly and helpful but you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a lot of contact with them if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve hired a car and are out doing your own thing. Towels are provided at the pool and the fridge has ice on tap. You just have to remember to switch on the icemaker. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a washing machine and dryer in your room so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to pack the suitcase to the brim. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gated community so there are security personel checking you in and out which provides piece of mind although check the window locks because we found a couple that were broken. The various apartments are arranged in blocks four storeys high. Just remember the first floor is the American ground floor. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about two minutes from Discovery Cove and Seaworld. Everything else is only a short drive away. The only very small criticism would be this. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no provisions store on site. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big Publix nearby but it would be good if there was somewhere on site to pick up milk and the basic provisions without having to get in the car. Also the crazy golf costs a fortune unless you buy a season ticket for your entire stay. If you just want one game it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pricy. Not sure why this needs to be the case.

There is no w/d in this type room but a free one very nearby with no waiting.

Another nice thing is that you can bring your own food/drinks to the pool,although the food at the Harbor grill was very tasty and well priced for the area.

The second pool is a bit smaller, but has a waterslide for young and old as well as a huge water splash park.

We stayed in 2 bedroomed villas, which were ideal for any length of stay, with two large bedrooms, a fully equipped kitchen, fantastic, efficient and badly needed washer dryers, and nice balconies. We availed of the outdoor barbecues to keep our costs down when stranded for the extra week, which worked really well. For those of you who like to shop, there are two excellent outlet centres within a 10 minute drive and the large bustling Florida Mall, 5 minutes further.

Check-in, polite, courteous, and fast. The efficiency room - good size, nice mattress, pillows a touch thin, small balcony, good size mini-fridge for an efficiency. We only have a 4yr. old daughter, so room size was good. I would put a maximum of two young (up to 10yr. old maybe) in this room type. This was the third year for another couple who traveled with us and they were fine with twin 5yr. olds in this type room. It was very clean upon check-in. This is NOT the one or two bedroom offerings at this resort, it's called an efficiency for a reason. We barely even slept there. So if you are a small (3-4 person family) and are on the go, either to the \"parks\" or swimming in the pool up until dusk and going to late dinners, than this is the room for you. The grounds - Meticulous!! They were CONSTANTLY cleaning. The elevators always had a pleasant smell, even the \"garbage room\" across from the elevators was clean and pleasant. I wanted to throw a beer to the workers, out of guilt, as a quick break for them. They were always working, but always stopped to say hi as you walked by. We didn't use maid service, but I did notice they were cleaning rooms right up until 5pm. The fire pit was nice one night, it made for a good \"Where ya from?\" meet and greet. The small \"boardwalk\" and dock / pier were very welcoming and would be perfect for catching a gentle breeze from the lake or a sunset. We did neither as our 4yr. old could care a less about either. The pools - Nicely warmed water. So much so that we swam even on a rainy cool 74 degree day. Then again, we were in 35 degree weather at home the day before! Only one complaint here, the \"splash park\" adjacent to one of the pools. You know, the one with the barrels that fill and dump water on the kids? For some strange reason they DO NOT heat the water for that feature. Strange, as that becomes the coldest water when it's sprayed from hose, falling from buckets, etc. The only time I saw children there is when they were just \"running through\", never to stop and play, and that was on one of the hottest days there. Very odd that this area didn't have heated water. The short water slide in on o f the pool complexes has a STRICT height restriction of 42 inches. You do have to closely monitor your younger children as there is no lifeguards and the pool(s) can get slightly crowded. But this is something any responsible parent would do in the first place. The pools never seemed over crowded though. The pool(s) have a good number of shady spots for the lighter complexion crowd. The activities - Great for the under 6yr. old crowd. Dry activities almost every morning. Almost afternoon they would have competitions in the pool complex with the pirate ship. The usual hula hoop, limbo, and other contests. They did get kinda repetitious toward the end of the week, but my 4yr. old still went out there like she never saw a hula hoop the day before. The food - Very good. We ate at the pool bar for lunch and dinner once. The quality was good, a decent value. Every day they had 2 for 1 drink specials from 3pm-5pm and service was very quick. I think once you get to the teen years with your children, this resort will lose it's luster. There isn't much of a nightlife here. A Caribbean night with some oldie \"island tunes\". Friday night was Karaoke night, it sounded like they were having fun there as we walked by after feeding the ducks. I am surprised to see that this resort is rated as a 3 out of 5 star resort by Tripadvisor. I would think this to be a 4 star in my middle-class eyes. If this is 3 star, I would love to one day see a 4 star. Hell, even a 5 star if I hit the lottery!! I can't say enough good things about this resort, it was that good. For the middle-class working man, this is a 5 star resort.

Excellent location for all the area theme parks, just a short drive to Disney, fabulous outlet malls and lots more. Sparkling clean, huge, full kitchen with everything you could possibly need on hand. Free WiFi, free parking, excellent off season rates. CONS: I was in the building closest to the hotel entrance which I was told was the newest building. I was disturbed by the noise made by cars driving over the wooden bridge that brings you to the hotel security gate. I considered asking to change rooms but I adjusted to the noise after one night. The noise is fairly constant from very early morning to very late in the evening so if you are noise sensitive request a room that is not near the front entrance.

The additional amenities, such as gas grilles, pool tables, ping-pong tables, basketball courts, playgrounds, gas fire pit, docks, sitting areas, arcade, Nintendo Wii tournaments, excercise room, and bars added greatly to the resort. The staff, to me, was the resorts greatest asset. We didn't speak to any staff member who wasn't smiling, cheerful, and very helpful. They were all very kind and gracious to us and to our children. Even the DJ who ran the karaoke night was very entertaining and friendly. (Special props to Erica, who led our Texas Hold 'Em tournament! Very good hostess!)

The location of the resort we felt was great. It is right near Sea World, and only a 10 minute drive to either Disney or Universal Studios. There is a 711 right up the road for any essentials. We We had previously requested the newest section of the resort, which is 30 and 31. The room itself was beautiful. A full kitchen, nice eating area, and a balcony all greeted us. The master bedroom had a king size bed, and an amazing shower. 2nd bedroom had two queen beds and a nice size bathroom as well. As for the resort, all I can say it is a children's paradise. My wife and I traveled with 3 kids, a 10, 4, and 2 year old. They were thoroughly entertained the entire week. There were activities for both age groups. The activity staff does an amazing job. The pool areas were great. They have a pirate ship with slides for kids of all ages, even my wife and I went down. All the pools have a shallow entry point, which was good for the kids. There was also a kiddie pool and jacuzzi all near by. The other pool had a large slide for older kids and adults. This was fun as well. We must have gone down it 30 times each. The staff we found to be very friendly. As I had previously said, the entertainment group was friendly. The staff at the Bar and Grill by the pirate ship pool were so friendly, and made the best Margueritas and Bloody Mary's for those that were interested. As for the time share, they really did not bother us. We had swapped out our week in las Vegas for this week. We received one call from the, and when we said we were not interested, that was it.

I would not recommend Horizons to anyone who wants a quiet, adult experience. There are kids all over the place, in a good way. Lots of fun and new friends for little ones. Overall Positives: 1. Very, very clean from the grounds to the villas to pool areas. Grounds/Housekeeping are very present and constant. 2. Great staff, very attentive and accommodating. 3. Resort is a nice managable size, not sprawling. easy to walk around to all areas/buildings. 4. Beautifully laid out, lots of places to relax outside of pool areas. Nice dock on the lake, lots of swing chairs. All Key West style buildings. Big firepit, grill area. 5. Great pools. Both pools were open for use during our stay. 6. Lots of non-swim stuff for kids to do (Captain's Quarters/Supervised craft area, Pool/Fooseball/Ping-pong/Video Games area, Great playground). Saw members of Captain's Crew (like camp counselors) attached to kids all the time. 7. Resort location close to everything (shopping, dining, theme parks). No more than a 10 minute drive to most places you would want/need. But you definitely need a car, not really walking distance to anything. There is a public bus that runs on Westwood to I-Drive, but it's inconvenient for shopping, etc. Overall Negatives: 1. Too close to I-4. The ever-present traffic noise is kind of a bummer. Eventually, you don't hear it, but you always know it's there. 2. We learned that they tend to do resort maintenance during Jan/Feb, their \"down\" months. As such, Pirate Ship pool was closed first 3 days we were there for repainting. However, the Pirate's Plunge pool was open and operating. In addition, they had set up (2) bounce houses for the kids to play on while the pirate ship pool was closed. Nice, considering they didn't have to. Management committed to have Pirate Ship pool open by Monday of our stay and they met their commitment, so we were able to enjoy it. As we were leaving, they had closed the Spash area in the Pirate's Plunge pool area so that they could paint it as well. I guess the price of cleanliness and beautiful grounds is constant maintenance. In the end, it didn't spoil our fun, though. Villa positives: 1. We were in Bldg 31, which faces Westwood Road (Main Entrance), 6th floor, in a 1 bedroom lock-off unit. Kids slept on pull-out queen sofa bed that was actually not too bad to sleep on. Overall OK location. Not the best but not the worst in the resort. If I were to pick a location, I would get a room overlooking the Pirate Ship pool. Nicest view. 2. Lovely interior decor. Key West style. Nice bright colors. Our building was opened in Dec 08, so the room was brand new and felt like it. Again, clean! clean! clean! 3. Large flat panel LG TVs in Master and Living Rooms. Separate DVD players for each as well. Helpful with little kids... 4. Nice kitchen area. Large enough to prepare a family meal with ease. Also, very well stocked with utensils, cooking equipment. Villa negatives: 1. They should consider upgrading the appointments in the villas. We have stayed in villas in other nearby resorts and they usually have things like granite/stone countertops in kitchen and bath areas, jetted tubs in Master bath. Our Horizons villa had formica counters...just not as nice (it's minor, but I noticed). Bathroom, while perfectly OK, felt like a plain old hotel bathroom, not a villa bathroom. Final tip: For those who don't want the timeshare people calling at 8am during their stay: don't pick up the \"welcome package\" they offer you when you check-in. It is the loss-leader for the timeshare folks to lure you in. Once you accept that package, they have free license to call you and hound you 'til you give in to the timeshare tour. If you don't pick it up, they don't ever call. You're not missing anything big if you don't pick up the package.

The unit was large enough that we could spread out and not be in each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way and offered many conveniences of home. The combined kitchen/dining/living room area was roomy and led to a large screened in porch that held a table and chairs for four. The kitchen contained everything we needed to cook in our unit if we so desired. There were enough dishes and utensils for eight people. This Marriott property felt like a summer family camp. The resort had so many amenities we could not even make use of them all. Most of them were geared to kids, and our kids liked them so much that they wanted to spend more time at the resort instead of going to the Disney parks. First off, there were two separate pool areas. The Horizons Harbour pool area was right below our balcony in building 13. This was a pool with a pirate ship water play area built in. The pool was a nice temperature, and though the pirate ship looked to me as if it would only appeal to toddlers, my 11 and 9 year olds loved it as well. The other pool area, Pirate Plunge, was across the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153street\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from our building, and because of this, we spent less time at it. Also, it had a twisty water slide entering it that had a 42\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd height requirement. The Pirate Plunge area also had a water playground area, but this water was not heated like the pools, so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t attracting any kids in November. As well as the pools, which our kids could not get enough of, there was miniature golf, ping pong tables, fooze ball, and a sport court. There was also an outdoor firepit which we never used. The resort was centrally located to all tourist attractions in Orlando. It was especially close to Sea World. A five minute drive had you to a grocery store and drug store. The resort complex was big, but not so big that you felt you were walking great distances from one area to another. Our kids loved the place so much, they really did not care about all the Orlando area attractions. However, for parents, I would have like to see a real restaurant on-site. Sure there was the Harborside pool bar and grill that we ate at because it was convenient, but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a very diverse menu. This resort is clearly geared to families with young kids. Marriott has done a lot of things right to appeal to this target audience and as a result, the resort was full of multi-generational families. It is a great retreat for kids, but slightly less relaxing for adults.", "Date": "January 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Forest Hills, NY", "Title": "\u201cAlmost perfect...\u201d", "Author": "godzuki24", "ReviewID": "UR23345316", "Content": "Marriott knows their stuff. Clearly you can see from the other reviews that this place is great. I'm an owner at the new Myrtle Beach location and found the Horizon's to be top notch. Here are my thoughts, relative to my other Vacation Club experiences and Marriott/Marriott level resort experiences. Front Desk Staff (Checkin)- Super friendly and excited to see you. They could do a better job of explaining things for new visitors, but this isn't a big deal. Rooms- well appointed and spacious. You can fit as many people and more. GREAT kitchen layout and appliances. BRs are nice and there are enough TVs to keep any family happy. Balconies are a nice touch and safe for the kids. Pool- great, pool staff was great. Food/Dining- standard fare with professional and friendly staff. Always a Marriott trademark and they hit the nail on the head here. Activities- There are two types here and this was a bit of a problem. You had retirees/adult staff who took pride in their work and really went out of their way to make you feel welcome. They did a phenomenal job. Then there were the \"kids\" who seemed to be there because they had to. Not a care in the world other than where they were going to party this coming weekend. Simply put, they might as well have been paintings on the wall. Sad, but I guess not everything can be perfect. Concierge- BIG let down. In a town like Orlando I would have expected a professional who knew what to do, where to do it and be able to get me some sort of discount. None of this happened. The week we stayed there were three young ladies who seldom smiled, didn't ask how things went the night before, nor took initiative to help out with future planning. Suprised, and saddened as a seasoned business traveler I count on concierge's and other industry professionals to guide me- and reward them handsomely for it. Misc- The BBQ grills on property need to be updated. Either bring in new gas grills or clean up/replace the existing ones. This may seem trivial, but the MB property has top notch Weber(like) gas grills emacculately cleaned daily and ready for use, not to mention very strategically located throughout the property. The directions that they provide you with to go places are pretty weak. Overall, the place is great. Its down the block from Seaworld- which is my favorite, and a short drive to Disney as well as many other attractions on International Blvd. We'll be back whether they make changes or not.

The pools...ohhh the pools...just amazing...We could safely sit by and watch our son splash and run around and not have to worry about him falling in, running off, etc... all the pools have the gradual walk in which is key. We even got into it, going down the slides and such, good times. My son of course LOVED the little pools which was fine with us as the bar with drinks and food were right there.

After tons of research, we decided to stay here vs. a Disney resort based on the fact that we could get a two bedroom villa, kitchen, etc., for way less than a Disney basic room with not even a mini fridge or microwave. We arrived in the area 3 hours before check-in and were thrilled that our room was ready, in a brand new building that just opened 2 weeks prior. The villa was spacious and immaculate. A nice Publix is minutes away, so stocking the fridge was the first order of business. (Paper towels, toilet paper, dish detergent, sponge, dishwasher detergent, soap, shampoo, and laundry detergent for one load are provided). The amenities to entertain children are great-mini golf, pools, game room, outdoor ping pong, pool table, playground. Likewise, the 2 pool bars kept the parents happy, one of which serves food and take-out. Everything within the resort is within a 2-3 minute walking distance. When researching other resorts, many seemed so massive; I didn't want to have to get in a car to drive to the pool. While the location is right off of I-4, I don't believe any of the balconies faced the Interstate. I didn't notice any highway noise, even with doors open. Didn't get to check out the gym due to our long days at the park, but there are plenty of jogging/walking friendly paths. If there were any cons, it would be the maid service, which was very sporradic. This wasn't an issue for us, as we took out our own trash and had plenty of towels. We got fresh towels and our beds made every other day. Coffee was never replenished, so be sure to pick up your own when grocery shopping. Also, be sure to take some towels to the pool-there are none provided at the pool areas. We will most likely stay here on our next trip to Disney. As we visited during a peak-week, it was nice to be away from the Disney crowds and not have to drag tired kids out to equally crowded restaurants. And the washer/dryer was put to use-kids were fithy by the end of the day, plus it allowed us to pack lighter.", "Date": "January 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa", "Title": "\u201cDon't pass this place up\u201d", "Author": "4SABUNCH", "ReviewID": "UR23072421", "Content": "We stayed at the Horizons Nov 15 - 20 with a group of three adults and two children (both 4 yrs old). The Horizons exceeded our expectations. I'd highly recommend this resort to anyone with a group of four or more and kids younger than teen years. I'll go through the positives first: *Great location for parks. SeaWorld is literally down the road, just a short 2 min drive. All of the Disney parks are just 2 exits south and about 10 mins to any of them. Didn't make it to Universal so can't comment on distance to them. *Close to necessities. A safe Wal Mart supercenter open 24 hrs is about 5 min drive away. A Publix grocery is also a couple of minutes away as well. Close to International drive and lost of eating/gas station options. *Security. Really nice to know that the only access into the resort was through a guarded entrance. You either have to be staying there or have your name on their list. Never once had to worry about belongings being stolen or broken into. We came back from one day at the parks to realize we hadn't fully latched the door and anyone could've walked right in.....nothing was missing. *Tremendously courteous staff. Extremely helpful staff. Have a concierge service that provides tix to all of the parks and are the same prices the parks offer. *Wonderful rooms. You are basically getting a 2BR/2BA condo. The master BR has a king, the guest has 2 queens. Pictures don't do the suites justice; you'll have TONS of space. The BRs are one half of the unit. The other half has a living room area, dining area and a full kitchen (microwave, stove, dishwasher, etc) including washer/dryer. They stock everything for you from place settings (dishes, silverware, cups, etc) and eating utensils down to laundry and dish soap. You don't need to go finding those things as they'll already have it for you. *Nice to have amenities. Each BR room has its own closet, bathroom facilities and TV. There is also a TV in the living area that has a dvd player. That was really handy to have for the kids. A safe was located in the master BR closet. *Cleanliness. Upon arrival, everything was clean and ready to use from dishes down to sheets and bathrooms. *Quiet. We were on the 3rd floor. Only heard our neighbors or those above us maybe a couple of times. Possible negatives: *Really soft beds and pillows. Can only speak for the king beds. Kind of sank into the mattress and the pillows were down-filled. We were so tired it didn't matter. *Safe isn't big enough. The in-room safe was too small to really hold anything of value other than maybe a wallet or cell phone. You won't be able to fit gaming systems or portable dvd players in it. *Hard water. You'll definitely want to get bottled water to drink and maybe even make food with. It's fine for showering or washing things but that's about it. *Possibly Dirty Carpet. We were in building 13 which may be one of the older units. In some cases, the carpets may need some cleaning. I'm sure with using the pools, they can accumulate some dirt. Plan ahead and bring some sandals or something to wear around if needed. Items you may want to know: *The Horizons is a time share resort. Expect one to two time share invitations or calls. That said, they were NEVER pushy, and took a no for a no. We only had two calls, and they were both extremely pleasant to deal with. *May have to do some self cleaning. We didn't sign up for the extra daily cleaning (charge for that), so you may need to empty trash, wash dishes, make beds yourself. Not a big deal to us. *Room entrances and hallways are exposed to, or on the outside. It's not like your typical resort where there are enclosed hallways leading to your rooms. *It was too cold for us to use the pools during our stay, but they had several to chose from and seemed to look like a lot of fun. *Read prior reviews about slow elevators. Never seemed to be an issue with us, but being on the 3rd floor may have had something to do with it. Since it was so cold, it actually felt nice to be in a somewhat warmer elevator. Overall, if you have young children and need space.... look no further. If we ever have another Disney trip planned, we'll be staying here again.", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reno, NV", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for Orlando Vacation\u201d", "Author": "MichelleReno_NV", "ReviewID": "UR22000539", "Content": "We stayed from 11/7-11/14 on an exchange from Interval. The staff was more than helpful from beginning to end. This is a wonderful place to stay when traveling to Oralndo for a family vacation. Location: it does not get much better than this really. 10 min from the airport (there is really only 1 hwy, and it is a toll road. expect 2 stops for .75 cents each, $1.25 total) Sea World/Discovery Cover litterally right around the corner. .5 mile to the I-4, where you are: 2 exits from the Disney World parks (granted once off the exit Disney has you driving a couple more miles to get to the specific park you want) 1 exit from International Drive Walmart is about 5 min away. Publix (the major grocery store) about 7 min for the exploring type familis, only 1 hr to Daytona, or Kenedy Space Center. The front desk staff automatically provide a list of directions to about 10 desitnations (parks, shopping, airport, etc). Nice to have. The resort itself was fantastic. We took our daughter (6 yrs) and she had a blast. She loved the waterslide (open until 10 pm most nights), as well as the pirate ship (open until 11pm most nights). The staff coordinating the children's activities were genuinley happy to play with the kids and had lots of activities for them. They would play games to include all ages, and every child received a \"wooden token\". Once the kids collected 6 or 10 of these tokens, they could trade them in for prizes at the front desk. We did have a room next to the water slide, so I was a bit concerned there was going to be a lot of noise in the morning, but this was not the case at all. Not sure if it was because most families left the resort to visit the parks, but all was well, and there were no unexpected wake up noises to be had. We had a 1 bedroom and it was very spacious. Kitchen was very large and comfortable, full size refrigerator and dishwasher. It did come with pots/pans to cook, but would have been nice if it had a cookie sheet as well. The unit also had a washer/dryer so that we could wash some of our clothing. It came with one package of Tide soap, but we bought more at the Wal-Mart. The room was a good size, with lots of pillows. Since we were on an exchange we had to clean the room ourselves during our stay, but the hotel does offer a \"Tidy Service\" if you want them to do it for you. No idea how much it costs as we opted to clean up after ourselves. The one bathroom was a good size as well. though I would have liked an option to not have the fan on all the time the light was on. It was a bit noisy, but not unbearable. The food on site was priced a little high, but that was to be expected, as you pay for convenience. Nice to know that it was open until 11 pm, for those late night munchies. As for the timeshare call,, yes we did receive one. But we only received one call, and they were not as pushy as I have seen at other places. They try to lure you in to give you a deal on Disney tix, but we declined and they never asked again. We did receive a call for a complimentary 5x7 photo of the family, but we never had time to make the appointment and take advantage of it. A tip: Be sure to bring your own DVD's with you. The hotel does have a small selection, but charges $8 per night to rent them. If you have a membership with Blockbuster, that would be a better option. There is a Blockbuster about 8 min away, and this is a better deal.

It is a wonderful family friendly place and could be a destination in itself. There is a 24 hour guard at the gate entering the facility and 24 hour front desk person. We really packed a lot into our trip of 8 days and 7 nights with 5 day Walt Disney World Tickets and 2 day Sea World Tickets so we did not spend a lot of time at our accomodations. However, every night without fail our three children would beg to do something at the condo - swim in the two pools or play ping pong, mostly. The grounds were wonderful as were the onsite amenities. I do have a few areas for improvement, though. My husband asked for a lake view on the sixth (top) floor so it would be quiet and relaxing. We were put on the top floor end unit of bldg 15 - the unit/bldg closest to State Route 4 - a very busy and loud highway that could even be heard inside our bedroom when trying to sleep at night and forget about spending any time on the balcony overlooking the lake. It would have been nice if they would have really listened to our request of \"quiet and relaxing\". It was a very nice layout in the condo, however, there was no door on the shower area of the master bath. For a condo that can sleep 8, and was sleeping 5 in our case, there really needs to be a door on the shower room. The interior of the condo was not maintained as nicely as the grounds of the facility. There was a very large stain on the carpet in the main living room and some smaller stains in the master bedroom, the carpet was visibly dirty on the outline areas, it had very visible traffic patterns worn into the carpet, and the duvet cover on the beds kept coming apart and sliding off of the comforter. All in all - the interior of the condo was nice, but had passed its prime; it needed some attention, (and sound proofing). I was also disappointed that there was a charge on some of the onsite entertainment such as a charge to get a ping pong ball and a charge to play minature golf. We were relentlessly pursued to come to the 90 minute presentation to buy a time share even though they knew we were there on an exchange week, we told them immediately that we were too heavily booked everyday with the theme parks, and that we had no interest in buying a time share there.

We'd stayed at Disney's Beach Club Villas our last trip, and we assumed this would be a \"downgrade\" comparatively. We were wrong! The pools were much more parent/child friendly, with tons of interative splash play, and a better waterslide. The kids enjoyed the Marriot \"Pirate Night\" way better than their evening at the BCV kid's club the year before. (The chaperones were much more kid oriented and attentive at the Marriot.) The condo itself was fantastic--the only thing we missed compared to the BVC was the whirlpool tub. They did have a deep soaking tub in the second bath, but the master bath has a generous shower. The kitchen was huge and well furnished, we had a full sized refrigerator, and the eating area and den were way more spacious than our Disney version. The location was easily accessible from 4, or International Drive. It was approximately 15 minutes into DIsneyworld each day. The one drawback we saw compared to the BVC was paying for parking, and missing the Extra Magic Hours. Granted, it is convenient to stay on Disney property, but for the price and amenities, we felt like royalty! As far as the standard pricing of Horizons, I believe rack rate is $250 a night. You probably can rent points from owners for a reduced rate. Also, the 90 minute info session ended up being less than an hour, as they understood we were not interested at all.

But, I totally loved having a two bedroom, two bath villa with full kitchen and all flatware, cookware, and tableware for 8 at my disposal. And a combo washer/dryer, even if I never used it. I actually got a great deal due to my Marriott membership (one night free with purchase of two nights) and the total price was less than two nights at Disney Animal Kingdom standard room (which I've also reviewed). Positives: - Lots of room - Very clean and nice decor - Up-to-date appliances (stove is newer than mine at home) - Great view (Villa # 1243) - Great A/C (My husband is always stuffy at Disney, but no trouble here and it kept 70-75F easily) - Literally seconds from I4 exit (great for getting to Disney). - One block from SeaWorld (almost walkable but not with toddlers) Negatives: - No real serious ones - Our rooms were limited with outdoor light (small windows) so needed electric light even during the day in the bedrooms). Recommendations for travelers: - Shop at nearby Publix (2 blocks East on Central Florida Parkway) and have breakfast or snacks in house - If you're going to be on property for a while, they have lots of kiddie activities and the waterplay areas looked great. - Don't travel on Central Florida Parkway after 8:30 am or late afternoon. SeaWorld traffic is ridiculous. Shortcut that may help is to take a right on SeaWorld Drive from Westwood and then you have the right-of way to turn right on CFP. - If you get a room/villa with a balcony facing north, you have a great view of the SeaWorld and Universal Studios fireworks at 9pm nightly. Our balcony faced South, so we stood in front of our door on the fourth floor of bldg 12. Recommendations for Hotel: - Do housekeeping earlier in the day. The two days we were there they came at 5:30pm. - Elevators seem slow and are very hot. The corridors aren't that visually appealing either but that may be a factor of them being outdoors.

Let me state right from the start that we stayed in a studio and we have recently stayed at the Ko Olina Beach Club on Oahu and the Surf Club in Aruba - both are very nice. So we had those two resorts to compare to, which isn't fair for the Horizons, especially when staying in the studio. I looked at a 2 bedroom unit and it's definitely smaller and not as nice as the Ko Olina (or the Grande Vista, where my in-laws were staying on this same trip). Anyway, the Horizons is definitely aimed at families who are not looking for a luxurious resort experience. Decor was nice but not over the top - to compare, Ko Olina had granite counter tops in the kitchen and both baths! The pools were great. The bigger version with the pirate ship had an area bigger than most resort's entire pool where my 2 year old could walk around easily. Lots of slides and spouts to play with. There is also a kiddy pool. The location was great for Sea World and just off the freeway for about a 8-10 mile journey to WDW. It was nice to have the exit right off of the freeway. As an aside, I noticed some people talk about freeway noise in other posts. We stayed in building 29 which was a bit further away from the road, but not much. I never heard the freeway. There was construction and we did receive 3 calls at around 9.20am regarding various sales pitches. We were gone by then anyway, so it didn't bother us at all. My in-laws told us that the pools were very busy at Grande Vista, and found it difficult to get a chair one day. We only spent about 3 part days at the pool, but never had any difficulty getting a spot. The negative to the resort is probably the food/restaurants or lack thereof. I only found one restaurant, near the pirate ship/bigger pool. It was more like a casual take out from the bar type place, and was fine. I would've like more choices. But there are plenty of restaurants within easy driving distance, so it's really not a big deal. I would highly recommend NOT staying in a studio!! Especially if you're used to the one bedroom type place. We had the lockout portion to \"use up\" as I like to say, and felt like this room was jammed in a corner. I won't do that again!! I really felt like I was slummin' it! :) It was better than a regular hotel room, though, in that we had a toaster :) Lastly, I was expecting laundry as other studios at mariott properties have had it, and this one did not.", "Date": "July 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blue Bell, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cThe only place to stay with your family\u201d", "Author": "sapamire", "ReviewID": "UR17551209", "Content": "If you are looking for a place to stay with your family, this is the only place to look. My wife and I took our 11 and 9 year olds to this Marriott. It is fantastic. We've stayed in many places and this is the first place where we have really only positive things to say. Here's an overview of what we liked about the place. The location is right next to SeaWorld. Out of the front door, we could see the fireworks a little after 10pm. We were in building 12 and had a clear view of it. From our back patio, we could see the Disney fireworks. The 2 swimming pools there are great. One has a pirate ship and the other is almost like a water park. It has a 16 foot high slide and a play area with 2 dunking water tanks that drops hundreds of gallons of water on you. The rooms are well kept and very clean. The room has a screened in back patio. There are plenty of BBQ places, a miniature putt-putt course, arcade and a snack bar. Here's an overview of what we did: We went to the Kennedy Space Center and took the tour there. It's a great place to show the kids how our space program evolved over the years. We went to Universal Studios for 2 days -- Universal and Island Adventure. I preferred Island Adventure because I thought the rides were more fun. However, the Simpsons ride in Universal is excellent. The simulation of that ride makes you feel like you are actually free falling and riding on a rollercoaster -- well worth the visit and the wait in line. If you are going this summer, go online and get the 2 park 7 day pass for $89. It's a great deal. We also went to the Animal Kingdom. The safari ride is very good and worth the price of admission. Just make sure you get there early so you can take that tour. That is when you can see the most amount of active animals in the safari. We went to Siesta Key, south of Tampa and about 1 hour 40 minutes from the hotel. However, if you want to visit the best sandy beach in Florida, this is the place to go. The sand is ultra fine and the water is warm -- 80 degrees. The crowds are minimal, parking is easy and they have a snack shack there with all the beach food you would want. Overall, this was a fantastic family vacation. The hotel and location is excellent.

We had originally booked for 4 nights at Floridays, but I kept reading how rude the employees were there so I switched (and paid more) to stay at Horizons. Plus, after seeing the Pirate Pool area on the website, I knew my kids would have a blast there! Check in was a breeze and we got a 5th floor 2 BR condo overlooking the Pirate Pool. Very clean, very well maintained, and larger than we expected. I especially liked the screened in balcony area. The timeshare folks did leave a couple of messages on our phone, but we weren't interested in a tour. I didn't feel pressured at all. There's actually two separate pool areas--one with the Pirate Ship, the other with the water slide. Both are within easy walking distance of each other. There's also an outdoor bar and grill where you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner, but no indoor seating. We never took advantage of the mini golf or basketball courts. They do have a beautiful boardwalk and dock area for fishing though--just watch out for gators! Just a few minutes from Seaworld, Discovery Cove, Aquatica so very convenient. Our stay here was fabulous, and we would definitely consider coming back. My only drawbacks were: --The king size mattress we had in our bedroom was unusually soft. We got used to it eventually, but the first morning my wife and I both woke up a little stiff and achy. --The resort is in desperate need of some sort of transportation option. I prefer not to rent cars, so all of our back and forths to theme parks, dinner shows, Publix store, even a walk in clinic (swimmer's ear) had to be done by cab. It really added up over 5 days.

My kids are 5, 6 and 7 and I couldn't have asked for a more kid/family oriented facility. It was perfect. 1. The check in process was flawless and friendly. I made an advanced request to have an upper floor, firework view villa. We were put on the 3rd floor, building 15 which was perfect. Great views of the Magic Kingdom Wishes fireworks and the lake. 2. The 2 bedroom villa was immaculate and extremely spacious. (1 King, 2 Queens). There is TONS of closet space. The screened in porch was very child friendly. It is cement half way up with a guard rail type border so there is no way a toddler could fall through the screen. 3. The pools are fantastic. One has the pirate ship and the other a larger, traditional water slide. There is also an adjoining 'splash park' which the kids loved. It's full of sprinklers, water cannons, buckets dumping out water, etc. There is even a special faucet to fill your squirt guns! All pools have atleast 2 hot tubs. For adults, there is a great pool bar which is fairly priced. Also, all pools have gates with locks shoulder level high so there's no chance of an escaping youngster. 4. There are more activities than you will have time for (mini golf, pirate camp, arcade, vollyball, etc.). You could spend 2 or 3 days just at the resort without even going to any parks. 5. Kitchens in the room are well equipped. We saved tons by going to the local market and cooking 2 meals per day. Purchase water ahead of time and freeze it overnight. That alone will save you $$. 6. We got to the parks at 8:30, stayed until 1:00 or so and returned to the resort for the afternoon. We returned to the parks after dinner and a rest which was a saving grace for my kids. This plan worked perfectly. There were no tears, overtired, crabby kids. I recommend it highly! 7. One major thing we loved is that almost everyone here had kids. When we've traveled in the past, we always were trying to hush the kids and worried about typical noise. Here, everyone was understanding and friendly as we're all in the same boat. Kids could be kids and were courteous but not paranoid about our kids being kids. 8. The housekeeping was great, fresh towels, clean dishes, empty trash,etc. every day.

As other members have stated the pool was a huge hit with my children, as soon as we left one of the parks the pool is all they wanted to do. The villas are well equip and roomy for 5 people. The kitchens helped cut the price of food out as we were able to have breakfast in the unit every morning prior to hitting the parks. Sea World is 3 minuets away (6 if you hit the red light lol) Universal is 10 minuets away and Disney about 15 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 20 depending on which park you are visiting. Food shopping is close by and the ramp to the interstate is really close, this is wonderful for going to Disney, but there is no ramp to the East bound if you are visiting Universal. I would definitely stay here again, the staff was friendly, and house keeping brought extra towels mid week even though there is a washer and dryer in the unit. We ate some appetizers at the pool side bar one night and they were good for what you would expect for bar food. The grounds were clean and well kept and there is a guard house at the entrance which is nice, so that only the people staying at the resort are allowed in. Two other tips for your visit, the first if you come down early and stay on the Disney property like we did, they will give you a free parking pass while you are staying on property. I forgot to remove the pass and when we arrived at Animal Kingdom the next day after checking into the villas at Horizons we were waved through and not charged for parking, the same thing happed all week, I guess they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t check the dates just the pass. The second things is that I noticed a lot of stores and restaurants in Florida now require you show ID to use a credit card and that the name on the ID must be the same as the credit card, just a info thing if you are going to let your son or daughter barrow your credit card.", "Date": "April 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "phoenix", "Title": "\u201cKids Paradise!\u201d", "Author": "chad44", "ReviewID": "UR14331207", "Content": "If you have kids under 10............Stay here if you can!

I must properly credit the front desk manager for making sure the first night was gratis (as well as providing me a 2 night certificate for any Marriott for one year). Though the Cypress was nicer in terms of the interior quality of the villa, we we disappointed because we were unable to shop for groceries and truly settle in for the next 5 days. The next day we checked back in to the Horizons only to be put in what seems like one of the older villas which had a view of the construction across the street (Building 10, avoid it like the plague). This is the accomodation a Platinum Member gets for his loyalty to the brand???? Again, disappointing. Also, the AC when it came on for either our villa or the one near ours was ear-shattering. Interior of villa less \"refined\" than Cypress, but we came to this resort for the pools. The pools and grounds were very well maintained and the kids had a great time in the pool.

I am writing this review from the resort. This is our last day of 7 days. My husband and I came here for the International Home Builders Show and to tour the Disney parks. The last two years we stayed at the Grande Vista via a time share trade. This year we had not used our week with Marriott in order to get 100,000 extra rewards points, which you can do every other year.(a great way to rack up points for future trips)...so we had to pay...went to the Interval World website and found a deal for a week stay...needed a 2 bdrm, as we have another couple with us....Horizons had a 2 bdrm available. I read every review before booking. Even though we have no children with us, the resort is close to the convention center and has two queen beds in the second bdrm, which would make our guests more comfortable. I called 2 wks. ahead to request a lake front villa in bldg. 12, because it is farther from the freeway. Upon arrival, a villa was not available yet in that bldg., and we had already bought groceries, and needed to ck in, so they offered us a top floor unit in bldg. 15, closest bldg. to the freeway, but told us the unit was in the center of the bldg, so we took it. The unit was really cute...beach theme throughout..Key West style casual furniture and decor. Great view of the lake from the balcony. My only complaint was that the freeway was very close by and out on the balcony, very noisy, even though we were in the center of the bldg. However, inside with the doors closed, it was quiet and could hear just a hum of muffled traffic from our bedroom window in the master. Since we were going to be gone most of every day, we thought it would be ok...But not pleasant to sit out on the balcony to read with all the noise....So, my advice to you is not to stay in this bldg. if you want peace and quiet outside. I would request bldg. 13 or 14...both have side views of the lake and face a quieter pool area. (there is another pool with a water slide across the drive in front of bldg. 29, the newest bldg....That bldg. faces the freeway, however...although set back a bit more than bldg. 15...if you are on a lower floor, you will not see the freeway. A new bldg. is underway at the entrance of the resort facing a pond with a fountain. This bldg., when completed, will be ideal for quietness and a nice view of the pond. Every bldg. is a very short walk to the pools and outdoor activities. since it is Feb., not many children here, so if you are empty nesters, as us, this is a fine resort at this time of year. On the plus side: newer bldgs. have the big screen 43 inch tv's in the livingrooms (including bldg. 15) (bldg. 12 does not). units have nicer furnishings than I thought from reading some previous reviews...and kitchens are very well stocked..and I love the Fiestaware dishes in bright colors. guest bdrm is quite large and guest bath is very roomy On the minus side: resort is a little too close to the freeway unless you are in bldgs closer to the entrance. Units are a bit worn in some carpet areas and upholstery, I guess from heavy use by families with kids.... Master bdrm bath area is not to my liking the way it is layed out...shower and vanity/sink area is open to the bdrm...so when i take a shower, I can see my husband sleeping in bed and he can hear me and watch me in the shower, which is close to the bed...toilet is in a separate water closet...vanity has only one sink in master so we had to take turns....and it is a small area. Compared to the Grande Vista, this resort does not have the luxury feel, but it is far from the Motel Six variety, as stated in a previous review...It is very delightful with all the Caribbean colors and is very clean and the pool areas are just fantastic for children. Next time, though, we will return to either the Grande Vista or the Cypress Harbor, as both are more quiet, further from freeway and have larger master baths with dual sinks. this little resort is geared towards the kids, for sure.

Plus, having easy access to I-4 made getting to the parks each day a breeze. The rooms are wonderfully spacious and functional and the two pool/recreation areas are fantastic for the little ones and their parents. If only the great accomodations and amenities were matched by its staff. They're all actually quite friendly, but are very incompetant. It's hard to describe exactly how, but one example is that on the TV in each room there's a \"Horizons\" channel that lists nonstop the menu choices from their onsite grill, but with absolutely NO number to call to get that food delivered. When we looked up the number in the directory and called, no one picked up. So, we just walked down there to order. We explained to them we just tried to call and no one answered, to which they said non-chalantly, \"Oh yeah. We turned the phone off so we didn't have to answer it.\" I just had to scratch my head. Just weird. Another example is one night I went to miniature golf with my daughter. They had told me earlier in the day that it's open until 9pm. However, when I got there at about 7:30pm, along with about 3 other parents and their kids, the teenager behind the counter told us that he was going to instead close up at 8pm because of lack of customers. Uh, hello! You're telling this to 3 guests ready to play! The customers have arrived, genious! Anyway, he \"graciously\" let us play for a half hour for free, but that's not the point. It was clear he was just bored and wanted to get the heck out of there. We all had to rush through and only play about 8 holes before he shut off the lights and locked up. No way to treat potential timeshare purchasers. Still, like I've already mentioned, it's a very nice property - so much so that I just have to give it 4 stars. But they really have to look into improving their staff some how if they want to give their nonstop timeshare schpiels any merit.

He had to be asked to do things--he wasnot willing to offer himself. We called down later and had him call S.W. to make sure the tickets were there so we didn't get over there and have problems. Second, we asked for towels from housekeeping b/c we had used up all our towels and had not washed them yet.

If we wanted our room to be cleaned or needed towels, toilet paper, coffee filters, trash bags, etc., we were to call and request them. They would bring them up only when asked. We were to take the trash out to a trash chute by the elevators.

This was our first weeklong vacation as a family, and I had exhaustively researched dozens of properties. We decided on Horizons based on the reviews and photos here on TripAdvisor. It was fantastic. We got a five-night package (which included 2 adult one-day tickets to a Disney park) for $995 ($199/night) via Marriott's website. They let us stay an additional night for $209. I called about a month before our trip with some questions, and they emailed me their 18-page property guide with a property map and daily activities. I highly recommend calling and asking for this. Also in their email, they said to let them know if we had any requests for our room. Based on reviews I had read here on Trip Advisor, I asked for a room in the newest building, on a high floor, facing Disney's evening fireworks show. We were given room 2855, which met all of my requests; I was thrilled! The accommodations at Horizons are, in a word, fantastic. The one thing that stands out for me is this: almost all of the Disney Resorts, even Deluxe--no matter how exquisitely themed--are just nice hotel ROOMS, that is to say, a SINGLE room: bed, TV, desk, chair, bathroom, maybe a fridge/mini kitchen. Not bad, but still basically a hotel room, and the beds or the bathroom sink will always be in view. Horizons, on the other hand, is full-blown condo: 2 separate bedrooms w/ TVs, 2 separate full bathrooms, a full furnished kitchen, full dining area, additional snack/counter area with stools, washer/dryer (admittedly small), spacious living room with 40+\" TV, and a screened balcony, all decorated with a very comfortable, relaxed decor. For us, a family of five accustomed to tripping over our suitcases and pull-out sofa-beds in typical hotel rooms, this was an absolute dream. It really felt like home for our stay; in fact, parts of it were even nicer than home! I know it's not on-site, but for us the accommodations were such a quantum leap above anything Disney offered--especially in this price range--we didn't think twice about staying off-site. Obviously it does take a little more time getting to and from the parks. But, it was actually nice to escape the \"Disney machine\" in the mornings and evenings, and again, with great accommodations, we didn't mind leaving. Plus, I was actually glad to not have to eat 3 meals a day on-site. In addition to the great rooms, Horizons has more family friendly amenities and features than any resort I have ever seen. The TWO amazing pools, game room, miniature golf, basketball court, pool tables, plus the kids' activities, all of which are well-documented in other reviews here. Aside from the pools, we didn't really take advantage of these since we wanted to get to the Disney parks ASAP each morning. Our only qualms with our stay were these: 1. The A/C unit for the villa is right next to the balcony...and since all of the balconies (and A/C units) are on the same side of the building, you hear the noise from ALL of the A/C units on your balcony, and it's pretty loud. A review here mentioned noise from I-4, and I had to laugh; I would have loved for our balcony area to be quiet enough to have heard noise from I-4 (hundreds of feet away)! This kept us from spending much time on our balcony. 2. Two of the days of our stay, we found some ants in our kitchen. If we had seen them again, we probably would have asked to be relocated, but we never saw any more. Not sure how bad this problem is. 3. For all of the kids activities offered, most are not free. The daily ice cream sundaes are $3, I believe miniature golf is $5, etc. 4. Washer/dryer is the stacked kind, and are super-small. Some additional pluses: --Free wireless internet access --Staff was super-responsive and speedy with every request we had (which were not many) --Seven channels of HBO (and Disney Channel East/West) on the TVs, plus DVD player in living room. --Kitchen was very well furnished with plates, glasses, utensils, can opener, etc. Also provided packets of laundry detergent and dishwasher detergent. One interesting note: Upon returning to our villa at the end of our first day, we saw we had received housekeeping: Beds made, bathrooms cleaned, kitchen cleaned, dishwasher loaded and run, and 8 fresh bath towels and 6 fresh beach towels provided. Our welcome brochure stated that housekeeping was $22 or $37 per day, so I called the front desk, but they said that housekeeping was included with our rate. I don't know if that's becoming standard or not. Our stay at Horizons greatly exceeded our expectations and was easily one of the best things about our entire trip. Even though we probably won't return to Disney until our daughters are a few years older, I expect we'll be back in Orlando for other activities just so we can stay at Horizons again. It's that great!

The reviews were so great I had such high expectations and was somewhat disappointed. We had a 2 bedroom suite on the highest floor facing the pirate ship pool area. Our bedroom faced the pool area so we heard the noise until 10:30 and sometimes to 11:00pm. Fortunately, my little guys were in the 2nd bedroom facing the opposite direction. The unit is large enough for 6 people to sleep. The kitchen is fully stocked and the resort provides you with dish detergent, dishwashing detergent and some liquid laundry detergent. It is very convenient having the laundry machines in the room. I found it very surprising the next day that our room was not made and cleaned. I learned that there was no maid service and we had to do it ourselves. This is one of my big peeves. I do not like going on vacation where I need to make the beds and ask for new towels. I do this at home and want to escape the chores if you know what I mean. The resort had fast food type meals which was a disappointment to me. We noticed they had breakfast but decided not to try it since the lunches at the one grill wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that great. Most reviewers raved about the pools, slides and pirate ship for the little kids to play on. But to our disappointment they looked old and in desperate or cleaning and fresh coat of paint. Obviously, the kids did not notice this and thought the pirate ship and pirates plunge slide were great. But they did get bored of it quickly and 2 days at the pool was enough for them. Fortunately, there are many things to do in Orlando as long as you are willing to spend money. We did drive out to St. Augustine for 2 days to go fishing and spend time on the beach. The ride was 1 hr and 45 min. but we like that area and did not mind the drive. However, there are other beaches closer to the resort. Sea World is around the corner from the resort so that was another great 2 days to spend with the kids.

The pools were so fun for the kids. This is a family resort. There are kids around. Don't stay here if kids bother you. We will stay here each time we come to Orlando again.

We went to Disney for 5 out of our 7 days and stayed at Horizons for the entire visit.

On the 3rd day we upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite for an additional $59 a night and it was well worth it. We stayed in building 28 which is just outside the splash pad. Our view from our balcony was great. There was a full service kitchen, a large kitchen/nook table, a living room with a pull out couch and a seperate bedroom with a king size bed. This was perfect for our family of 4. The walk to the main pool with the pirate ship was a bit of a walk for our toddler because you had to walk around the entire building to get to the pool. No big deal though. We got the pirate cups for the ice cream socials and the kids got a kick out of getting ice cream every day between 2-3 p.m. The pools are absolutely fabulous for young kids. My youngest could touch the bottom of the pool almost everywhere. My kids also liked that they had a playground. The staff also had entertainment by the pool one day including, the limbo, balloon toss, and a hula hoop game. Very cute. The staff at this resort was very nice and they seemed very accomodating. We would return to this resort again and not go to Disney. To make a long story short, this was a perfect place to return to after a day at the parks. One downfall was that there is an additional charge for housekeeping each day. I don't like taking out the trash on my vacation.

I have to say that initially I was disappointed because the resort is so small and very close to the road. Our last vacation was at the Marriott Grande Vista and it was so secluded and difinitely more of an upscale property. Horizons lacks the \"awe factor\" that the Grande Vista emulates. I have to say that I quickly changed my mind though. My husband describes the resort as having more of a comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. After giving the resort a chance I knew he was right. The rooms are very nice and the two queen beds were difinitely a hit for the children. The Staff is very young but competent and friendly. I have two boys who are 10 and 6 and they just loved both the Pirate ship pool and the slide pool. Our room overlooked the pirate ship pool and it gave a tropical setting as well as one of excitement. We set aside days to just stay at the resort and let our boys participate in the activities. They loved the hoola hoop contests, the limbo, the dancing, the kareokee, the scooter races, the music and especially the miniature golf. The bar has great drinks and good food, some very special frozen drinks for the kids. The resort is so entertaining for the children that the adults can relax and enjoy. As for the interstate 4 noise ,which was mentioned as a problem in other reviews, we never heard it even when we tried to listen. The resort has the ability to still be an oasis and the music, the activities and the splashing water sounds all cover any outside noise. And the hot tubs are the best design I've ever seen, even if they are busy you can still get a quiet corner to relax and enjoy. My only request would be to add a market place convenient store, I did miss that. Needless to say this resort is definitely worth a visit, we were all sad to leave it.

If we had read the fine print we wouldn't have stayed here. The pirate-themed front desk staff wasn't very sympathetic. Arrr. About the \"lock-out\" room. It was slightly larger than an average hotel room and had a small screened-in balcony. The theme is tropical, and the walls are painted bright yellow and the drapes are blue and green. The room also boasted a basic kitchenette, featuring a microwave, a coffee maker, a small refrigerator, some dishes, and a bar sink. The mattress on our queen-sized bed was springy, thin and cheap, but at this newish stage in its life it was okay. At one point my husband tried the couch's pull-out bed, but found it to be far worse. We had a smallish (27-30\") television and asked the hotel staff for a DVD player, which they eventually supplied. All the countertops were white Formica and the counter in the bathroom was very low. The bathtub was shallow. All the plumbing fixtures were comprised of white plastic. No doubt this is a nod to their main clientele - kids. Expect to receive an early morning phone call from a very enthusiastic timeshare salesperson if you are using a relative's or friend's timeshare. Kids, kids, kids! They're everywhere. This hotel is a kid's paradise. There are 2 main pools, one with a nice waterslide, and couple of large hot tubs. There is a pirate ship and some sort of tower that shoots kids with water. They lock up the pools and hot tubs around 10 PM. There is very basic miniature golf ($5 a day) course and a basketball court. I also saw a schedule for kiddy crafts and other activities. There's also a small arcade. Best of all? There's a bar! The drinks are reasonably priced. You can also order some food there, which is a relief as this complex has no room service.

Comfortable beds, with fluffy duvets. Pool areas are amazing, The entire property is well maintained, cozy, & clean. Staff went out of their way to be helpful. For example, the main pool, with the pirate ship closes at 11, while the other one with the water playground & slide closes at 10. Unfortunately, the side walk to the main pool, which runs along the 2nd. pool also closes at 10(apparantly this is to be corrected with a fence in the weeks to come) so we had to walk through the parking lots to get to the main pool after 10. The security man drove & picked us up in his golf cart. Also, when we went to the 2nd. pool one night at 7, the water playground was closed, much to the diasppointment of my children. I was told it was because it was cool out. When I pointed out that it wasn't really fair- the lifegaurd for the water slide contacted maintenence, & had it turned on. The maintenence man later came to talk to us- he was also very friendly & empathetic. I expect to be treated by courteous staff, but these people can really become friends they're so nice. The only downside I encountered is that there's no walkthrough in the \"L\" shaped buildings, so one needs to walk around the buildings to get to the pool, main lobby, etc. However, considering the sizes of some of the properties in Orlando, & walking distances to pools in some places, this glitch pales in comparison. We took 4 children along, & I highly recommend it for families. If you're looking for a more adult atmosphere to lay by the pool, this may not be the place for you.(As a side note, although this property is only about 7 years old, apparantly the \"old' buildings are currently being re-painted, & getting big screen tv's & new appliances, so it probably won't be necessary to request newer buildings.

We were contacted directly by mail by Marriott directly with a time-share presentation package. Our package was for a 2-bedroom villa for 4 nights for $199. Total? Yep, total! Awesome! So we booked. Arrived 12/23 at 7:30 a.m. Check-in is 4 p.m. so our room wasn't available. We visited Downtown Disney Marketplace and then returned to enjoy the pools until our unit was ready, which unfortunately turned out to be 4 p.m. Our unit was very nice, true typical Marriott. I was unable to download my photos because the files were too big but the photos posted by other users are very very true to what the units/ grounds and pools look like. We have 2 kids, ages 9 & 10 and go to Florida every year for Christmas and take along our Christmas tree and all the gifts.

The master suite was large, with a comfy bed and it's own bathroom. Toilet was in it's own closet but oversized shower and sink area were open to the bedroom. Big closet with wall safe. Second bedroom very nice with two queen beds. All bedding was luxurious. Second bathroom was large and comfy and had access to kitchen and second bedroom. Lots of closet space throughout (bring some extra hangers though). Kitchen was well furnished but I always bring along my own frying pan. Dishwasher and washer/dryer (apartment size), and THREE tv's operated well. We were even able to connect the Play Station. Big sliding glass doors onto a very private balcony. Unfortunately our particular balcony was completely completely blocked by trees. There were only two balconies in the place blocked by trees and unfortunately we were one. You couldn't even see the pool. I think the trees should be trimmed a bit but .....I don't own the place and you know we only ended up paying $50/nite. Housekeeping: Daily housekeeping was included in the price. For owners this costs an additional $20/week. \"Light Service\" included making of beds, providing new towels and vacuuming. We had this service twice and decline it on the other days because we didn't need it. Pools: Pools were awesome. Main pool has a big pirate ship theme with water canons the kids (and husbands) can shoot, slides and varying water depths. Snack bar nearby too. Lots of tables, chaise lounges. Other pool is less interactive but has a great slide and an area just off the pool with lots of kids' interaction, including a huge bucket that dumps tons of water. It was really nice. The grounds: Marriott is a \"work in progress\". Although there was no construction while we were there, we were told at our time share tour that the place is only 25% built. When it's finished it's going to be a huge place, including it's own movie theatre. That work has got to start sometime, so check on that before you book. Time Share Tour: We knew before we even booked the unit that we would not be buying any timeshare. The tour required 90 minutes of our time, which was no big deal as we visit every Christmas, but we told the Marriiott rep right up front that we were not interested and stayed with that. The rep went thru the pricing but we stayed fast and kept saying no. No pressure, but we weren't interested. If they see any glimmer of interest, you will be taken on a tour of the time share which will take another hour of your time. Don't worry about being \"nice\", if you aren't interested you're just wasting everyone's time. We got out in 40 minutes. Overall, the resort is beautiful and I highly recommend it to anyone.

We stayed at Cypress Harbour last summer and have also stayed at Sheraton Vistana as well as many of the deluxe Disney resorts and the Universal Lowe's resorts. While you can't beat the theming and \"feel\" of Disney and Universal resorts, this resort is a wonderful family resort that every member of your family, regardless of age can enjoy. We love Cypress Harbour, too, but I really liked the small town feel of Horizons over the sprawling Cypress Harbour complex. I was unsure of what building to request as I had them fax me a resort map a week before and it was hard to see the building numbers. So, I called a few days before and told the clerk I would like to be near the basketball courts/large pool (Pirate's Plunge) and she recommended building 14. Upon check in, they put me in building 29, said it was their newest building and I would like it better so I agreed. The room did seem pretty new as it was in excellent condition and was technically close to everything, however, the way they have the buildings situated makes you have to walk farther. The entrance to the rooms is on the far side, away from all the common areas and there isn't a typical middle walk through hallway so you have to walk completely around the buildings which was the biggest pain. When you enter the property, that drive is the main drive of the whole complex. On the right hand side is building 29 & 28 which are connected. After passing the buildings on the same side of the road is Pirates Plunge with large slide, the miniture golf course, basketball courts, pavillon where they have pool table, ping pong and foosball tables (and where they have many events) and a small snack stand (just chips and sodas). Directly across the little street is the Lobby with a large fitness center on the second floor, the only restaurant, Horizons Harbour with Pirate Ship, large jacuzzi and the dock/large lake. Building 14 faces towards Horizon Harbour but you can see the basketball courts from them as well (if we go back I would definitly stay in this building). The only restaurant is outdoors so if it's raining they close up. The food was surprisingly good...mostly salads, chicken wings and fingers, sandwiches and the like. They usually featured an off the menu entree item every night. It is located right next to Horizons Harbour so its nice to have a decent meal while lounging by the pool. They have a bar with stools and probably about 10 tables or you can eat by the pool. There is also a room for kids with a handful of video games and some small tables for arts and crafts. It was geared more towards kids under 10 and the small selection of video games don't really classify it as a gameroom (compared to the gamerooms we are used to). Upon check in they will give you an itinerary of all the events going on everyday. They have competitions for the kids like Treasure Dive in the pool, ping pong tournament, foosball tournament, 3 point basketball shoot out, etc. These are fun for kids of all ages. Kids receive pirate tokens for each event they participate in and can trade them in at the end of the stay for a prize. There is plenty to do if you just want to hang out at the resort and take a break from the parks. Location is in the middle of everything...10 minute drive to Universal, Disney, I-Drive and practically right next door to Sea World. You can see Sea World's fireworks every night from the resort. On the 4th we went up to the 6th floor and could see tons of fireworks way off in the distance all around. All in all, in was a great resort and my 11 year old son loved the basketball courts, which many resorts lack. There were kids of all ages around and almost always something to do.

I thought it looked wonderful from the pictures and the reviews I read made me even more excited. Location: My first impression was that the property is a good deal spaced out from other facilities which was nice considering how large the Orlando area is. Now of course there are Marriot properties across Westwood Rd from our location and another on the other side, but you never hear anyone or are bothered in the least by it. I was expecting a normal stay somewhere where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one business on top of another, and the Marriot Horizons was nothing of the sort. When you come across the quaint little bridge at the entrance and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a duck crossing sign, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but smile because you feel safe and like you are coming into this wonderful place. The hotel is situated on Lake Willis which is very beautiful and relaxing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lovely to be able to stop what you are doing and enjoy the scenic nature around you. Our balcony had a wonderful view of the lake and for those less fortunate, there were always available chairs and swings to sit in along the walkway and enjoy the facilities of the lake. Which is of course a very nice luxury. Room Description: The room keys that they provide have the Captain Horizon on the front posing by the swimming pool and I thought this is a perfect little room key because it just started off my vacation that much better to get something so much better then what I was expecting. I traveled to the resort with a two boys ages 2 and 5 and my sister and we all completely loved it. The boys loved the Captain key and were always wanting to use that one because it was so much better then the replacement one we received when my sister lost her key. I absolutely died for the shower that I had in the Master Bedroom, it had two showerheads and they both would work at the same time so it was nice to be able to stand under a steady one and then take the other one and move it around to wash whatever I was needing to at the moment, and the bathtub in the other room was absolutely fabulous. Of course it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a Whirlpool by any means, but it was deep enough that it could have been and that to me was almost as nice. All of the beds were so squishy and comfortable when you first laid down, you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to move an inch after that because then everything might not be as perfect. It was like heaven right there in the comfort of your beautiful room. We were on the Sixth floor which is of course the top floor at the Horizons and it was very reassuring knowing that the entire balcony is screened in so there is no danger with the children throwing anything off or them injuring themselves out on the balcony. Communications with Resort: We were never bothered with offers of time share presentations or anything of that sort, of course here we were two young ladies with two young children, so we probably weren\u00e2\u20ac\u02dct the large scale family that they generally attempt to sell to. Although it was wonderful having enough utensils and towels for a much larger group, because it just made everything that much easier, extra towels and such. The only calls received during our stay from the staff were regarding a brush fire in the area and they were reassuring us via the voicemail system that everything was ok and we are in no danger according to the Orlando Fire Department who had the fire under control. They left a total of three voicemails informing us of this fact, I would have enjoyed if the phone actually beeped to let you know that they had left a message rather then actually call all of the rooms individually, but the little light on the phone seemed to be able to catch my attention enough to actually check the messages. And they called us once to inform us about the Guest Relations person and she gave us her name and extension in case we needed anything during our stay. Pools: The pools were great and often a big hit with the boys. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a big fan of the Waterworks part because it never seemed crowded and the water was just so cold. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much fun to aim a cannon at nothing because there is no one playing in the area due to the cold water temp (in May!!). The long water slide was great for older kids but I felt like it beat me up and slammed me into the walls as I was sliding down holding the boys. The whirlpool tubs around the hotel are absolutely amazing, they seat 15 people and have palm trees in the middle and reminded me of a lazy river due to the design. I was really impressed with these because I have never seen hot tubs designed so impressively. It was great being able to ask the boys if they would like to head to the waterpark, and they would get really excited no matter where we where or what we were doing. This made trips back to the hotel really easy because we weren't having to fight with the children to get them to leave Disney or shopping. Cool Stuff: One of the great things about the stay was the souvenir cup at the bar which was a little over 8 dollars originally and could be used for any type of frozen alcoholic beverage imaginable and then refills were only 5 dollars each for the rest of your stay. Which seems like a pretty sweet deal when you count on spending almost 7 dollars per drink without that cup. I also really enjoyed the Turkey Panini it was a wonderful sandwich and looked as good as it tasted. Activities: There were always activities going on at the hotel from pirate scavenger hunts, to dives for treasure, eat out activities with the pirates and even karaoke. The boys would get tokens when they participate in the activities at the hotel and at checkout would be issued some prizes in accordance with the number of tokens they had. My opinion of the Activities: The only disappoint I had was when we went to the Pirate Treasure Dive and there were so many kids, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do a good job of letting the little ones head out first and my son who is two had everyone snatching the treasure away from him and trying to push him around even though I was standing next to him and I was just shocked at the way these children were behaving. The children are told to get as many as possible and then they get free sundaes or free tokens to be used for prizes at checkout and I had to bug the people just to give my son a token for participating because he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually get any treasure because according to the rules, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help and pick anything up for him and there were all these 7-10 year old kids pushing everyone else out of the way so they could get more prizes. I felt there should have been a better division of ages and of course that they should have taken a time break between releasing the 5 and under group and the older group because all of the children playing on the same structure is just asking from problems. We also chose to do the Pirate Lunch, the parents drop off their children and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go with them which seems a little odd to myself seeing as how there is only one counselor, or at least there was when we did our lunch and one would have to be VERY trusting to drop off their children with a complete stranger for an hour or so not knowing where they are and in which building they are located (maybe there is more staff if there are more children?). Also for this one program, it's the only one that doesn't have a set time the other dinners are all from 5-7 or 4-9 or something completely set. When I asked the front desk about this, they just said from 30 minutes to an hour depending on the number of children there, yet all other meals and activities like this have set schedules no matter how many people sign up. The fact that there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t more then one person sitting there supervising the other in case of situations of false accusations was unusual to me. Now like I said, I did go along with the group and this activity was the only one that didn't start for 5 and up, it said under 5 must have an adult come with them for the luncheon. So I felt this was the only one I was welcome to go with the kids and that both boys could enjoy. Our group ended up being 4 young girls and my two boys in the group along with the one male counselor. We were taken to a room upstairs above the lobby in a totally different building then where we started and they were fed their lunch and they got to watch Spongebob, I know not exactly what the parents pay for, but it was the beginning. I really felt that our going to the lunch was totally worth the money (it was 10 dollars per child but my 2 year old and I just tagged along, so we only paid for one lunch/child). The lunch they are given is pre-selected by the parents and his chicken fingers would have been 5.95 regularly and then the lunch also comes with a free sundae during the ice cream hour between 2-3pm everyday, which is regularly 3 dollars. So basically I came out one dollar behind, although they entertain your child and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an amazing way to get tokens for the checkout and at the end they received real tokens to be used in the arcade games back in the Horizons Hall (they guy even gave my son and I tokens also, so all three of us got some tokens to play with), we ended up getting over 19 tokens for the prizes for the two boys just at this one lunch (keep in mind they only need 6 or 10 to trade in for the prizes and of course they cut the kids some slack if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite have enough). The lunch also comes with your choice of chocolate or regular milk (but for some reason they didn't ask me when I signed us up and Noah ended up getting Chocolate Milk and he hates anything Chocolate but I had just juice with us so it was ok) and some little goodies for the kids, we received captain hook type hands, a coloring book with crayons, pirate necklaces (basic mardi gras beads), and many other things. Like I said, I completely felt like this was worth my money and then some, but was worried about the amount of trust that the other parents had in a complete stranger with a Captains Crew shirt on. The Captain himself made an appearance at our luncheon and the children got to ask him questions but the Captain never answered, it was always the gentleman watching the group that answered for him. I really thought the reason that the Captain has the eye patch was cute, apparently since his ship is now the water slide, he was climbing up the slide and a child was going down it and the kid's foot poked him in the eye and so now he has the dreaded eye patch. So I thought that was cute and a good way to teach the kids not to climb the slides, although they should make a little sign stating that and post it at the pool. As a cute little thing to read about the Captains history. Summary: Anyways so that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about all I have to say about our stay, a wonderful location although the interstate situation is a little odd, you can get on going west really close to the hotel but have to drive a few miles to get on the interstate going east and the same with getting off the interstate from the east. Although it is nice in the fact that the hotel is on the same street that was the exit ramp, so you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really get too lost. It was just a little difficult when they shut down all of the roads near the hotel due to the fire. I loved the room and the size of it, the table to eat at was amazing. The couch wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very comfortable but we used it anyways. The balcony was great along with the beds and showers. Bar drinks are good, pools are cool, I always felt safe at this location which is of course a very important thing. I guess it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to mention that the building we were staying in was being painted and therefore there were a few workers around every day, but they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother anyone that I know of and always seemed to keep to themselves, so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any sort of problem.", "Date": "May 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maine, USA", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location and facilities, understaffed\u201d", "Author": "Tripp'sDad", "ReviewID": "UR5020288", "Content": "I just returned from 5 days at this resort.

The unit was clean, and well maintained. The television in the guest room went out on our second day and they replaced it within 2 hours of my call. As I said, staff responsiveness was tremendous. The property has two pools. One pool has a slide and an adjacent water park. The other has a pirate ship in the center with smaller slides, water cannons, etc. Most of the younger children preferred the pirate ship pool. There was a solid activity schedule for the week, which included put put golf (on site), cane pole fishing, pool games, arts and crafts, etc. etc. Nearly all of the activities were family oriented. Our daughter is 3, so we did not go to Disney World this trip, but did go to Sea World a few times (1 mile away) after securing a discounted pass for the week through the consierge. She was perfectly happy to spend the week at the resort given all of the activities offered, plus the pirate ship pool (big hit).

We stayed in building 10 which I don't believe is a newer unit but it certainly was very clean and in excellent condition. It was very close to all the pools. The pirate ship pool was a blast for all our children. (unfortunately the weather was only warm enough for them to swim 1 day but they are heated.)We are thinking about buying a timeshare in Aruba since we are a family of 5 now and we were coming to Disney on spring break so that's why we decided to give this villa stay a try. I'm so glad we chose Horizons over Cypress Harbour because we had a hard time deciding but Thanks to all the reviews we decided to give Horizons a try (mainly because of the kid friendly aspect)and it really was the best decision we made. Cypress Harbour is right across the street from Horizons so we drove through but we thought it was too big and didnt seem to be the place to stay with young children. I can't say enough about this place it had basketball courts, soccer fields, waterworks play area, a two story waterslide, mini golf, and the staff does a great job of entertaining the kids at the pirate pool with games.

From our balcony, we could see the Magic Kingdom fireworks every evening. Close to everything. Easy drive to Disney. We went to the timeshare presentation...no high presure. Great place for kids...if I was going without kids, I would chose another Marriott location. This place is geared for kids. In addition to two pools, there is foosball, ping pong, pool table, play ground, basketball, Mini-golf $5, and a good resturant menu, somewhat reasonably priced on site. The room was very comfortable, with two queens and a king, as well as a pull-out. The kitchen was a good size, and the table was great, with bench seating for kids on half of the large table. We stayed at the Sheridan Vistana Village last year and had a good time. I think this place, with the awesome pools, is better for kids, but both were great.

Sheets on bed were worn but towels were in good condition. I requested early check-in.

As many people mentioned before, the pools (which are more like water parks) are the main attractions, for the kids and adults alike. They even had kiddie pool areas where my 10 month-old loved crawling and splashing. One of the things that stands out the most about this resort is how nice and accommodating staff are. Everything we asked for was at our door within 15 minutes. We called the front desk numerous times with questions -and were always answered promptly. Timeshare prez was not bad -not too much pressure, we refused and weren't bothered again, but Disney dollars came in handy. The one thing that's important to notice is that the resort is under construction. Thus, between 10 am-4 pm, you may be hearing noise. It only bothered me once, on a day I tried to sleep in and could hear the noise even with closed windows. But this is to be expected and they warn you about it.
