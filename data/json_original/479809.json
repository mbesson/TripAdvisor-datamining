{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A Stayed here during the Olympics as part of a group booking. Agree with other reviews that the beds were very firm, the hotel was not close to the centre and it was disappointing to have to pay for ammenties such as the swimming pool. The most frustrating thing was dealing with the staff on reception. We had a number of problems regarding pre payment of rooms, whether we had paid for breakfasts and ended up needing to speak to the sales manager to try and resolve things which took a significant amount of time. To end it all we were charged for using/opening items in the room (which we hadnt) and no matter how much we protested our case they wouldnt listen to us. As we needed to leave for the aiport we ended up paying for these items and later found out that others groups had had the same problem", "Date": "Sep 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR472795635", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "bel0723"}, {"Content": "Good Hotel       View of City from Xinyuan Room", "Date": "Jul 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR882152652", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "adigression"}, {"Content": "Satisfactory stay We were booked here as part of a group tour. The room was very nice and the beds were very frim (the firmest of the 4 hotels we stayed at on our trip) that was fine for us as it is our preference. Not so for some we were traveling with. The breakfast buffet was good. We were able to have some familiar western food (e.i. eggs- fried, scrambled, potatoes, coffee, toast) along with a variety of Chinese fare. The room had blow dryer and a hot water pot for boiled water, a fridge, and assorted toiletries(some complimentary -some for sale) and snacks(for sale). Upon arrival the room was stuffy. the thermostat did not seem to work. But we left the window open and by the next day we were comfortable. Cannot comment on location as we were carted by our group tour bus and we did not pay much attention to relative distance to attractions. We went to the Temple of Heaven one morning. That would be a place to go back and spend more time--huge and interesting if you enjoy a park like setting and alot of activity along with cultural interests. I was surprised how close to a section of the Great Wall we were. We were amazed to see the preparation all over the city, as well as the country, for the Olympics.", "Date": "Nov 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR587869594", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "MGPiv"}, {"Content": "\u59dd\u64b9\u7e4b\u9287\ue1ba\u5057\u9289\ue042\u5063\u9289\u70aa\u5063\u9289\u52e9\u5136\u9289?#x201d;   showReview(19168731, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR740290998", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Buen hotel, pero lejos de todo       Habitacion", "Date": "Aug 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR993658536", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "carapan"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d479809-r19656667-Beijing_Xinyuan_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "479809", "Price": "$172"}}
