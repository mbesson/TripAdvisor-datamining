{"Reviews": [{"Content": "totally adequate. I had read some pretty bad reviews about this hotel, but as we were staying only one night and it was cheap (\u9227?5.00 for a four bed room) and near the station, I said let's do it. It was great. The reception staff were nice and helpful and spoke english and french. The breakfast was great and there was loads of it. The garden was lovely. The rooms were air conditioned although we couldn't turn it up but at least it wasn't hot enough to have to open the windows. Which was lucky as we had a room on the main road. My husband thought it a bit noisy but the kids and I slept like logs. It was close to everything and had a locked room where you could keep your bags when you checked out, if you wanted to have a wander around before leaving Florence.Ok the decor in the rooms was a wee bit 70's but the rooms were clean and tidy. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to go back and would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "Aug 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR230157414", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Bull9"}, {"Content": "In Need of Rehab Stayed at the Castri in April of 2008.

Don't spend too much on this place. For tightwads only. The breakfast was decent, though. Rolls, cornetti, jellies, ham slices, cheese slices, coffee, milk, cereals, juices, and fruits.

We arrived with an open mind after reading these reviews, having booked a double room with \u9225\u6e03ity/garden views\u9225? We were first checked into a room with 2 single beds and a view of a wall. Further, the bathroom and carpet were disgusting and the room stank of stale smoke. After showing the guy on the desk our booking confirmation, which stated \u9225\u6997ity/garden views\u9225? we were promptly allocated another room. We couldn\u9225\u6a9b believe the difference between the 2 rooms and were very happy with the switch. The new room had wooden floors, a clean bathroom with a shower, was bright and airy and boasted fantastic views of the garden and city.

Was a bit perturbed after I had booked the rooms and then read some of these reviews. To be honest for what we paid, the rooms were fine. They were clean and quiet (I faced onto the garden at the back of the hotel). The staff were friendly and the breakfast filled a gap! Bread rolls, croissants, jams, yogurt, hams and cheese. I would ignore the 3* rating as it is more 2*. The rooms are fairly basic with very small shower room. This was my first time in Florence so can't really compare it to any other hotels in the area.

A bit of traffic, not many people walking around though). Close to many internet cafes as well as the Mercanto market. Nice unique rooms (fancy wooden shutters to look out on the street, high ceiling, etc.) and friendly staff. Nice quick breakfast included. Free postcards, nice tough.
