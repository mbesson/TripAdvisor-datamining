{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Wouldn't stay here again Our room was very, very tiny and very ugly. There were two of us and only one at a time could walk sideways around the bed. There was hardly any space to put our clothes and suite cases. Most of our things we left packed and shoved our suitcases under the bed. There was an eye stinging bright blue faux finish on the wall. My friend joked that it was a faux pas finish.In addition to this it was noisy. Our room was right off the lobby and every drunken reveler (and there were a few) plus the loud conversations of the hotel manager and staff kept us up at night and woke us early in the morning.Also there was mold in the shower. Not a good thing.What I can say is that the hotel is in a convenient location and there were lot's of good restaurants around us. It's also close to the train station; just a few minutes walk.", "Date": "Oct 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR849306629", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "movingon42"}, {"Content": "Good and OK My wife, daughter and I stayed at the Goldoni for three nights in April 2007. We choose the hotel because it is near our son's apartment. Because Florence is a walking city, the location is fine. As a matter of fact, its location is better than another hotel we stayed in on an earlier occasion, because it is away from the center of the city, where all of the crowds are. The breakfast was very good: cereals, pastries, yogurt, cappucino made at your request. The staff was exceedingly helpful and pleasant. My only suggestion is to make sure that you get a room far away from the reception area, as it tends to get noisy. It is on the second floor of the building, and it has a neat lift with double wooden/glass door.", "Date": "Apr 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR116650745", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "snresq"}, {"Content": "Good hotel, but...

It was well located although off the beaten path and very quiet. The bathroom had a kind of strange smell that lasted throughout the 3 days there. Also the room was decorated as if the furniture came from Rent-a-center. A blue mirrored headboard? The walls were sponge painted. It was fine but nothing special. Also, it was strange that although breakfast was free, they charged extra for cappucino and espresso in the morning. Coffee from a machine was available for free.

It's the 3rd time we have stayed in Florence, as well as visiting the Italian Lakes and Sorrento over the years. We stayed at the Goldoni about 5 years ago and when we revisited Florence this September we decided to stay there again. We've sampled some three star hotels in Italy and for a city centre hotel, the Goldoni certainly deserves its three star status. Yes, it's on the 2nd floor. The layout may be corridor like( reading other reviews) but it's in a very old building...that's Florence! Our triple room was spacious, well furnished and very clean. The buffet breakfast typically continental with a good variety of food. (No toast machine, no scrambled egg and bacon...oh dear!) The staff couldn't be more helpful.

On one side of the small landing are the rooms and on the other the reception and breakfast room and this is about it as far as the hotel facilities go! Our family room (1 double and 2 single beds) was spacious, furnished traditionally in dark polished wood with a writing desk and dining table included, with a small but adequate fresh bathroom , lovely tiled floor throughout and a view out the window of some sort of air shaft! Location and Florence itself, however, made up for any disappointment in having to negotiate more than 1 person being in the bathroom at the same time and the window view. The hotel's claim to fame as being somewhere Mozart had once stayed and it's intent to create a bygone atmosphere with the furnishings and decor gives the Goldoni an aura of Florence in olden times which , combined with the city's architecture, sights etc left us with a great impression of the city although my 13 year old found the Goldoni hotel to be a bit spooky. Overall we were happy with our stay at the hotel versus the cost and quite liked the old fashioned charm but would agree with other reviewers that the breakfast coffee machine coffee is not a good touch. All other hotels that we visited during our trip served large cups of freshly made capuccino! No other complaints though - good location, friendly , helpful staff.

When you arrive the entry staircase is a bit of a shock because the Hotel lives on the second floor but you get used to it. The Goldoni is a pleasant proprietor run hotel, he keeps a low profile with the consequent lack of attention to detail, though the staff were helpful when asked. Considering Florence is an expensive place to be the hotel was reasonable value and well situated. My wife and I stayed for six nights and for that duration the room was far too small and stuffy. I would go back (but only to a bigger room) and suggest you give it a try but beware of the zanzaris and perhaps the addition of some fruit would avoid me callling the breakfast PDB (pure dead boring).", "Date": "May 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR669950612", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "silverskater"}, {"Content": "Won't be staying again The Goldoni is in an excellent location, however we were very dissapointed with our room.

What a charming find! We debated whether to plump for usual 5* comfort or settle for a moderate hotel to enable our spending money to go further, given that Florence is a shopper's haven! We definitely made the right choice with the Goldoni. For history buffs, the Goldoni is known as the hotel where Mozart once stayed (the site of rooms 50 and 51). A Japanese film crew will shortly descend upon the hotel as part of a documentary being produced to commemorate the 250th anniversary of his birth. The Goldoni is very well located just 30 seconds behind the Arno, 5-10 minutes from Ponte/Vecchio and the Uffizi, 10 minutes from the station, along a street lined with tempting retromodern furnishings/antique and jewellery boutiques! The hotel is very cosy, clean and quiet (NB size of rooms do vary so be sure to ask for one of the bigger rooms). Service was charming and friendly (look out for Daniella on the front desk who is full of good tips about where to eat, making ticket reservations at museums etc).

We had a room for two, and it had two twin beds. The TV was tiny, but I didn't come to Florence to stay inside.

A great place to sleep after a whole day of touring. Don't let the outside fool you. The building looks old from the outside. Take the elevator up to the 2nd floor and that's where the hotel actually is.The breakfast was included in our price. Toast, yogurt, cold cereal, milk, juices, coffees and teas. They had nice semi-soft cheeses from Switzerland which were particularly nice, and the greatest cookies you could take with you for the day.It was about a 5 minute walk to the river, and another 5 to the major sights.The best part about the area was a price fix locals-only restaurant about 3-4 blocks away. Ten euros fixed price and you got the following: glass of wine, soft drink, and 3 courses. Salad, pasta, and your choice of meat with 1 or 2 sides. Locals were watching soccer on the tv. There were about 10 tables int he whole place. It was so good we went two nights in a row! If anyone is interested I can look for the name and the street.
