The island has a few rough edges mixed in with lots of local color. BBH has a convenient location, but few extras, and would best suit an independent traveler who plans to spend most of the time touring the island or going to one of the beaches during the day. It is absolutely essential to have a cell phone to contact the owner/managers when they are not in the office. While they will help with reserving island trips and restaurants etc, they encourage you to make these reservations yourself by cell phone. No phones in the rooms. To be honest, there are few amenities here and some sprucing up is still needed. On the plus side, the owners are a pleasant young couple, the pools are lovely, and the ocean view nonstop. You can walk to the little town, and it is perfectly safe to walk back to the hotel at night after dinner. We liked the other guests we met there and gathered a lot of the information about what to see and do from them. The island has plenty to offer in the way of history and natural phenomena. It would be wise to read up on the history of the island and the role the US Navy played in making the island what it is today (both good and bad) in order to really understand it. A good place to start gathering island information is at the office of The Vieques Conservation and Historical Trust in Esperanza. There is a wealth of information available there. Much better than the government-run tourist information office in Isabel Segunda. There are some very good restaurants and art galleries run by the large population of American artists who own winter homes there. The pace of the island is slow and the island is relatively free from over-development and honky-tonk tourist traps. A couple of final suggestions for planning your stay: Be sure to reserve a rental car before you arrive on the island. Jeeps are the best and fun to drive. Bring a raincoat for the frequent showers and just casual clothing. Be sure not to miss an evening in one of the little bistros in Isabel. You will hear some great music and enjoy good company along with the rum punch.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, FL", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Bravo Beach Hotel\u201d", "Author": "2ndxmom", "ReviewID": "UR127742915", "Content": "This was our first stay at Bravo Beach and it was a delightful little B & B.

The only minor downside was the shower water could be a bit inconsistent - on two occasions, it wasn't possible to get anything other than lukewarm water which was a bummer after scuba diving.

I have to tell you that we felt so blessed to have found this place by chance. It was clean and the owner was friendly. After trekking the island we noticed that the Bravo Beach Hotel was not only clean but also well maintained as compared to the other Hotels. The swimming pool in the back butts up against the beach where the sunset is simply incredible and romantic especially when in the pool with your partner. The roofs of the hotel have chairs to relax in and hey there is another pool in the court yard. I am telling you that you will not be disappointed if you decided to stay at the Brave Beach Hotel.

You will see in some of the reviews from the winter that they were under renovations but those are now completed. The hotel is very close to the ferry so you won't have to travel far. It is right on the ocean located outside of town, in a very quite location. The hotel is modern, sophisticated, while still maintaining the \"laid-back\" feel of the island. They owners are very welcoming and accomodating; what you would expect from a polite mid-western couple. We booked their courtyard room (the cheapest option) and when we showed up Karl(owner)informed us that they had a cancellation and they were upgrading us to the ocean-front suite for two nights (because as Karl said, \"it's your honeymoon afterall.\") The room was breath-taking, with a private patio overooking the ocean. We moved to the room we booked originally on the third night and this was nice as well, smaller but just as comfortable and has all the same amenities. Each room is equiped with a flat-screen tv/dvd player, air conditioning, hair dryers, Aveda toiletries, 2 beach chairs, 2 beach towels (in additiona to normal bath towels), and a cooler. All the beach items you can take off-site when you do beach exploring. The two pools are inviting. There is a patio area in the courtyard/garden that has a new large gas grill for the use of guests. There is also a very reasonably priced, fully equiped honor-bar, where you can make your own non-alcoholic/alcoholic drinks and simply write down your selections which will be added to your bill at the end of your stay. We do advise all staying here to rent a car of at least part of your trip. The island is spread-out and the beaches in the wildlife refuge are not to be missed.

The host and hostess (Carl and Janna) were incredibly helpful and warm, and also very organized (not something you always find in Puerto Rico). With all the dinner and beach recommendations, it was like having a free travel guide! And we loved having beach chairs, a cooler and beach towels provided. The property is in a great location, within walking distance to several restaurants and bars. And with two pools and lots of lounging locations, the hotel makes a day away from one of the islands' gorgeous beaches just as special.

We opted for an oceanview room, and I think we got the best one (#7). Our private balcony overlooked the ocean side pool and Atlantic surf - and off in the distance, Culebra. This property's incredible location is certainly part of its appeal. I would recommend an oceanview room, not only for the incredible view, but because an industrious rooster lives next to the court side rooms. Fortunately, the sound of the ocean (almost) drowns him out in the morning. The rooms themselves are simply appointed, but include a mini-fridge, beach chairs and cooler. There is still a little work to do to update them completely, but they met my expectations and I have no complaints. The property's grounds are wonderful and becoming even better by the day. The owners were painting and landscaping while we were there. There is a terrace above the oceanside pool for sunbathing. The garden pool is protected from the wind by a beautiful garden, but the sun still shines in most of the day. It is also next to the well-stocked honor bar. The continental breakfast has cereal, fresh fruit, toast, coffee and juice. When I booked the hotel, they were not offering a continental breakfast yet, so I was happy to find it on arrival. After spending $20 on a bad breakfast in Isabel II, it made me appreciate it that much more. The property is an easy walk into Isabel II, which has great places to eat (Conuco and El Patio) and grab a drink (Al\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mar Azul). When I asked various locals whether it was safe to walk around, I was assured that it was safe (usually with a chuckle). The ferry dock is about a 5 minute walk away from BBH, up and down a hill. Carl and Janna are great hosts and genuinely want to make sure that you have a great stay at their property. I gave this hotel 5 stars because it completely met \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and in very many ways exceeded \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my expectations, especially for the value.
