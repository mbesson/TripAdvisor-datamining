I was nervous after reading some of the reviews about the food and drink being so outrageously expensive. Don't get me wrong...it's not cheap. But do you expect that at a resort that costs $500/night++? Here's the \"deal\". Breakfast is typicall included, and you can eat it late. The downstairs restaurant is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and we ate all our dinners there, and they were reasonable and good. One night was authentican Mexican night, so that evening, we walked South on the beach two resorts (about 200 yards) to Le Reve, and had a FABULOUS dinner there and it was REALLY reasonable. But, the food at the Viceroy was very good, and not outrageously priced. The rooms were better than EVER! For complete privacy, I recommend the royal villas. They are not the most expensive, and will add 30-60 seconds to your walk to the beach, but are VERY private with both a pool AND an outdoor sundeck. Yes; there are some bugs here and there... you are in kind of a Jungle, but there is bug spray provided, and as long as you don't leave your villa doors open, they don't get inside. This place is such a tropical paradise. We continue to try other resorts that offers that the private pools, and we just keep coming back because the others just don't compare (or they are a lot more expensive, but not worth the extra money). The spa is fantastic...especially if you can book a massage while it's raining; it's almost magical because the massage room is open to the outside, yet screened in. We did have to ask for our pool heater to be turned on 3 times, but that was our only inconvience. The staff truly does everything they can to make your stay amazing. Yascara (the bartender), Carlos (waiter), Oscar (the butler) were all wonderful. Yascara makes a mean mango margarita! Also, shrimp tacos with chipotle sauce are not on the menu, but they made some for us a couple of times...they'll do about anything you ask!

Well, we might have been -- if the Tides (now Viceroy) hadn't been such a stunning, relaxing place. There are about 41 rooms, each of them a separate 'casita'. Ours had a huge bedroom, a small private pool, a secluded sun deck where we escaped the wind of the beach and watched each afternoon as the local monkey family crashed through the trees overhead, an outdoor shower, and excellent room service. When you want absolute privacy (and, by the way, some units are more private than others -- those in the back of the property being more secluded) you put the rope up across your entry path and you are utterly alone. Walk out and you are in a lovely ocean-front bar/cafe. The staff is extraordinary -- well trained, most speaking excellent English, and on top of that friendly and likable. Sometimes a place at this level invites a snobbery in its guests and a corresponding remoteness in staff. Not so here -- everyone was delightful. We didn't dine in their upstairs restaurant, La Marea, because we walked down the beach to Coco's Cabanas (see my review -- highly recommended if you want to go off-campus), but we did have breakfasts and some dinners at The Grill, their informal cafe and bar. Food was tasty (superb ceviche, as well as grilled octopus) but pitched to a resort (largely American) appetite and so not that earthy Mexican cuisine some of us look for. They were incredibly good about substituting ingredients and tailoring dishes to our preferences. We rented a car at the airport, assuming that we would drive out for snorkeling and touring. The weather was a factor, but in addition we were just so incredibly comfortable, so nested in our casita among the trees, that the first time we took the car out was when we headed back to the airport. It's that kind of place. We have never been so comfortable and relaxed in a resort.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cAbsolute best hotel experience in this world.

It is small in both size and the number of guests it can accomodate. We seldom saw more than 4 or 5 other couples. After you get used to the size, it is ultimately one of the very best things about the resort. You get a good feeling of what is to come when you approach the property. (The Viceroy transfers were great and competely easy from the Cancun airport.) There is no signage and when you arrive there is an open air reception without a front desk or point of information. You are met and personally walked through the property, which was very nice, but I think there needs to be a greater emphasis on how to contact or interact with hotel staff during the stay. We ultimately just dialed zero to make appoints and arrange for cars, but it always seemed a bit like we were floundering with the appropriate protocol. The property is just as much about the lush, well-cared for jungle grounds as it is about the ocean. We compared the jungle to a cross between \"Lost\" and Adventureland, with beautiful birds and monkeys. The grounds are really where the resort shines as they are beautiful and a complete contrast to the bright white sand of Mexican beaches. The beach was very nice and comfortable, but just one property along the same beach. The pier and palapa at the end was a great feature even though the poor staff had to keep chasing off folks who were not staying at the hotel. (Give the staff a break and put up a sign) We stayed in a new (as of December 2011) oceanview villa that was very stylish and yet fitting with the resort's design asthetic. The finishings were all very high end and the extra large bathrooms and outdoor showers are sublime. Perhaps as a factor of recently being built and young plantings, the oceanview villas do not have much privacy -- not that there was much traffic but the terraces and plunge pools are on the main path to the pool and beach. Based on what we heard from talking to other guests, we will opt next time for a new jungle villa that has greater seclusion. There is so much accessibility to the beach and the pool that we did not feel like we gained that much by having a distant oceanview from the room. The beachfront rooms are probably a different story. The room itself was very comfortable with a daybed on the terrace. My only three minor complaints about the room were the \"buffet\" of minibar selections that covered the surface of the credenza, which looks kind of out of place; the air conditioning that seemed to have a mind of its own (again instructions would be nice); and the lack of information about the hotel and who to contact for all the information that you forgot about from the prior day.There were flashes of brillance at the Viceroy. The spa and spa staff were terrific and it was transporting to have treatments while an afternoon rainstorm was passing through. The dinner on our villa's terrace was magical with candles, great food and the works. I would highly recommend both experiences. The food was terrific, if somewhat expensive. The markup on the Mexican wines (which were very good) shocked even a New Yorker. The very best thing about this property is the ability to really unplug. While there was wi-fi everywhere, the whole mood and approach forced us to relax. The was always a can-do attitude, same-day spa appointments, food whenever and wherever we wanted it. We eventually got so into the spirit of the place that we extended the trip by an extra day. Bottom-line, if you are looking for a relaxing, mind-clearing trip to RIviera Maya, then the Viceroy is impossible to beat.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Palm Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Trip at Great Expense\u201d", "Author": "lulu33469", "ReviewID": "UR124280101", "Content": "I have stayed at \"The Tides\" in Zihuatanejo, twice, so I had a idea, how superb \"The Tides\" can be even though the Viceroy has just taken over this hotel. We loved our Villa and the fact that our private plunge pool was heated and the temperature could be adjusted. Plenty of privacy, very clean & comfortable. However, we were disappointed that the main pool was not heated. We did not see anyone use the pool during our stay, which probably indicates that the other guests were indeed on the same page....the pool was chilly! The ocean was warmer than the pool. The staff were very friendly.....a little slow at times but in hind-sight that might have assisted in getting to the pace that I ultimately went to Mexico for. The villa was priced accordingly and typical with previous stays at Viceroy and or Tides hotels. You pay for the amenities and the exclusivity of the property with the room rate. The 15% service charge added to the displayed room rate. Now tipping on my room rate? I find that insulting. We found the cost of dining quite high, $88 for breakfast, which consisted of eggs on a tortilla, some bread, juice & coffee. This is far reaching especially in this economic climate & considering the location. I'm also okay with paying 15% service charge for spa, dining, for actual services...(not room rate though) in fact I usually tip 20% but when I open a beer or make myself a drink from bottle from my bar, I'm going to be charged a 15% service fee & 11% tax???

So having looked at the various resorts in the Playa del Carmen area I booked first the Banyan Tree and then decided on 'the Tides' as a second option. The website showed bright airy villas with plunge pools and places to lie out (even with luxury villas http://www.tidesrivieramaya.com/accommodations/luxury_villa.html). I was staying in a Royal Villa. As I was leaving from a hotel in Cancun I phoned the hotel ahead of time to confirm checkin time and was told my room would be ready at 12.00pm. After a difficult journey in a rental car due entirely to the fact that the signage to the hotel was damaged - fallen over and pointing in the wrong direction we arrived at 12.50pm. I was told on arrival the the room wasnt ready and when I tried to explain that I had phoned ahead I was ignored. We where then dragged on an entirely pointless tour of the resort of it this point I began to realise the resort was at best shabby but at worst dreadful. After being forced to eat a decidely average lunch (chewy and tough spare ribs and a caprese salad with 4 very small dots of balsamic and motzarella that would put pizza hut to shame- I even dropped a fork and placed it on the table and no one replaced it) we were finally shown to our room. I was totally HORRIFIED there was nowhere in the room or outdoor area with any natural light - in fact it took a while for my eyes to adjust to the dim internal gloom. Only the furthest quarter of the plunge pool had any light on it what so ever. I immediately let the butler know I wasnt happy with the room and in a knowing way he offered to show me another room. An hour later I was shown another room -equally as gloomy but with an area 2mx2m to lie out - again with no light on it but apparently 'at some times of day it does get sunlight ' (this was a Saasil Villa). I was told there were no other rooms available. I decided at this point I didnt want to spend two days of my holiday in twilight world - declined the upgrade and decided to check out the following day - a day early. I also noticed a huge hole in the bamboo surrounding the private shower (see photo) in line with what other reviewers have had to say. Having read other reviews on here I can catagorically say that I have no axe to grind but I just want to make sure people who are considering booking here have the full picture. I also have seen that with other negative reviews the general manager has tried to head these off by dismissing them in a generally patronising way. I would rather Pedro Lara spent his time improving his woeful hotel rather than dismissing people complaints (he wasn't on site when I stayed -probably answering complaints on tripadvisor).

There is a path for employees to get from villa to villa that isn't a main path. I felt like this definitely needs to be addressed. the bamboo fencing leaves up to 1 inch gaps in areas. My wife also had someone take the path and quickly walk past her while in the shower. This might be accidental by the staff or it could be a planned peeper. Regardless, this should be addressed. The rest of the villa was clean, the bed is very comfortable with high quality bedding. We really used our plunge pool more this time as it was heated and felt great to swim around in. The rooms are literally in the jungle. The first night we had this crazy loud bird spend the night on top of our villa. The locals have a name for this bird but I couldn't catch it. it chirps and squals all night long. it really kept me up the first night the remaining two nights he stayed further away and didn't keep us up. Your room is constantly being serviced throughout the day which is wonderful. There is always a new \"towel animal\" designed on your bed, it is a enjoyable treat. the mini bar is stocked daily. We love the rooms here, The best part of this resort is the attentive service, privacy, and food. The staff is always nice, professional and willing to accomodate. My wife and I had 3 meals a day at the hotel restaurant. The food is fantastic. the chef Jezzabel is a skilled artist. Jezzabel spoke with us after almost every meal to discuss the meal, our preferences, ideas for future menu's, etc. I love to eat and dine at great restaurants across the country and this is comparable. She made special dishes just for us. the food isn't cheap but it isn't too pricey. The kicker on the food/booze tab is that their is 15% service charge and 11% tax. It adds up. $7 beer bocomes a $10 beer. However we know this resort isn't for guests on a tight budget. None the less, the food was great. Everything is made in house from the breads to the tortillas to the pastas. It is all FANTASTIC. I recommend the pasta (i know it is weird to find outstanding pasta in Mexico), the mexican food is great. Carnitas, tacos, chili poblanos, mexican street food... all great. Breakfast is also really good, but i don't like to eat much in the morning. For lunch, the club sandwich is my favorite. Every meal was delicous. Every meal! Just make sure you use the bugspray before dinner, the mosquitos are bad at night. You can ask the waiter to get you some but it is easier to do it yourself in the villa. Each and every employee was very nice and friendly, most speak english well. Frenando is great, Ivan is very helpful, and so is everyone else. If you need something, just ask and they get it. The staff brings around frozen fruit that is very refreshing, cold fresh hand towels, will clean your sunglasses, provide food and booze at a moments notice. The tides completed the pier since my first stay and it was great to spend sometime jumping into the ocean, having private breakfest, etc on the dock. This is the way you want to get into the ocean bc their is a ladder, otherwise you will have to make it through some rocky areas to get in the ocean. The pool was also finished and my wife and i were the only ones that used it in the 3 days we were there. great pool, larger than i remembered. My big complaint is that their is still construction going on until Dec. They are building 10 new villas, some beachfront. This creates lots of unwanted noise. Hammering and a jackhammer at 8AM is not what I want to hear. If you are planning on staying while in construction, be prepaired to hear a constant saw, hammering or something. I would actually suggest postponing your stay until the construction is over with. This was our second time and both times construction was taking place. It just takes away from the peacefulness. The hotel grounds also are largely closed off due to construction. I hope they get this done quickly and make it private again. Another item that needs to be addressed is the poor wifi coverage. I can't leave my work at home, I always have to be connected for business. the wifi signal was so poor it took nearly 3 hours to download a large file that would have taken me about 4 minutes at home. I spoke to the staff about it and they had their IT guy out there the next morning trying to fix it. It is strange like the wifi connections are being throddled. I ended up unplugging my wifi and plug the ethernet cable directly into my computer. This worked great...fast speeds. but the ethernet port is short and at a odd location so i had work uncomfortably. If you don't need the wifi, then don't worry about it but if you need to do some work, be prepared for a poor connection. If you want to do some exciting trips like parasailing, kayacking, jet skis, atv tours, etc. the hotel can help you with these. There also is a nice guy with a little beach store and tours next to the tides to the left on the beach. This guy can also get you these activities for a little cheaper. I like using the hotel staff though. My wife and I will come back again but I'm going ot make sure no construction takes place when we are there. I hope that my review doesn't come off as negative, I'm simply making comments on the items that other travelers should be aware of. this place is amazing, it is my favorite place to relax for a couple of days. Three nights at the tides is my favorite way to unwind from work and spend quality time with my wife. I would recommend it.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Upper Darby, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cIt used to be great!

There was a dehumidifier running but it didn't work due to the leaks when it rained. We eventually had to move out because everything was getting wet and my asthma was getting bad due to the mold and mildew smell.

After an exhausting day in the airport and a lot of persistant time share folks and others in the Cancun airport---we made our way to the Gray Line transportation folks who got us on our way to the Tides. Let me just say ---anyone who has complained about the road leading into the resort obviously is just looking for something to complain about. It's not bad at all. We stayed at a great resort in St. Lucia but, it took us 20 minutes to get there on a very short road that was plauged by gigantic pot holes. The road to the Tides is not anything like that...in fact, it's quite good...just a little tricky for our driver to find. Once we made it to the resort our long day getting there thanks to U.S. Air was quickly forgotten...as we had a late lunch by the pool and had some amazing guacamole and freshly made chips with a beautiful view of the ocean. We went to our room...which was close to the pool and restaurant area...and the room was great! Very clean with a wonderful patio area and pool. The indoor / outdoor shower is fantastic. We had a couple's massage the night we arrived in the spa room with the outdoor waterfall...which was amazing! A nice surprise in our room...was the surround sound with our flat screen TV because the first few days at the resort it rained. So, luckily we brought a few DVDs from home that worked great when we couldn't go out. The beach area is really nice...it is a little rocky but, not a big deal...if you walk to the right out of the hotel....you can also use a little less rocky beach a little further down. The food at the hotel was very good. Every steak my husband got (flank steak and a sirloin ) were excellent. The grill on Friday nights is also very good. Two nights we went into playa del carmen for dinner...just to break it up....which I would definately do again. the Tides staff brings fresh coffee and croissants to your room every morning which was really nice...it kept us full until a late lunch. The staff was wonderful...always polite and any issue we had they took care of. It is a jungle so there are birds and little creatures all around but, I'm a big chicken and they didn't bother me at all...My husband saw a couple of monkeys near our room one morning...and I was bummed that I missed them. The only complaint i have...is that the Tides is undergoing some construction and there was construction going on right next to our room??!!! That was a little odd...because they certainly were not at full capacity and it seems like maybe they could have put us in another room away from the construction next door. I will say they were the most quiet construction crew I have ever heard...mainly hammering away with just a little chainsaw action here and there. we bought our trip through cheap tickets so we didn't know there was construction going on. It would have been nice if maybe they offered us something in return for the inconvience...like a discount or something but, that didn't happen. That would make sense if you're trying to get people to return or even try out one of the other Tides resorts.

From the beach-side candle-lit dinner to the private sun-deck in our villa and the incredible couple's massages in the \"jungle\" room of the spa every moment of our trip was relaxing and beautiful. The staff did not hesitate to provide us with anything we wanted including serving breakfast at our beach cabana (and offering cool, scented towelettes, sunglasses cleaning and cold fruit kabobs beach-side), arranging dinner reservations and transportation to other locations, and added freebies such as tequila and ceviche tasting & a quick massage on the beach. One day at lunch I ordered coconut water and a staff member literally climbed a tree and got a fresh coconut, chopped it open and served me the juice in a pitcher! I was highly impressed with the personalized attention and service at this resort. Our villa was gorgeous, air-conditioned (thank goodness, because it was HOT in June) & we really enjoyed the outdoor shower and private plunge pool. The property of the resort was beautiful, beach was clean and water was stunningly blue. I highly recommend Tides Riviera Maya. Some considerations while planning a trip here: The resort is somewhat tucked away--the entryway is quite narrow, not well-labeled and it's easy to miss if you are driving there yourself or guiding a cab driver there. Dining at the resort is rather pricey but the food was delicious. I was especially happy with their breakfast menu offering local dishes. Still, dining there every meal would definitely get rather steep. Luckily, there are a lot of places to dine in Playa del Carmen town. Yes, the villas are in the jungle and there are LOTS of mosquitos. Tides Riviera Maya provided our villa and patio with citronella candles and oils & mosquito repellant but it did not deter the little buggers from chewing up my legs. The property is quite dark at night.

The road to the resort went by some dilapidated properties and we were worried if we had made a mistake. Upon arrival to The Tides open air lobby we were greeted by our guide with a cold towel and a refreshing lemongrass coconut water. We breathed a sigh of relief as we were ushered into the relaxing, luxurious and calming environment of the resort. PROPERTY We selected The Tides because of its intimate, jungle to the beach setting. We were not disappointed with the mysterious winding paths leading you through the jungle to the private villas set within. Our villa was beautifully appointed \u2013 inside and out. The plunge pool was larger than I expected, more of a small, kidney shaped pool. It was a nice option when you wanted to cool off but not have to leave your private space. The resort was so quiet that you could hear the music from a neighboring resort but it was faint and not too disruptive. We wish we could have purchased the CD\u2019s provided in our room as well as the incense, but unfortunately neither were sold in the tiny hotel boutique. SERVICE If you want service at the beach or pool before 11AM you may have a hard time finding it. We were told upon check-in that we should ask the staff to set up our palapas/lounge chairs at the beach or pool. Since we prefer the morning sun we typically were out there by 9AM. We didn\u2019t mind arranging our chairs, towels, etc. but felt a little silly at times standing around waiting for service. The concierge/front desk staff were incredibly helpful and welcoming. The housekeeping and grounds crew kept the property looking gorgeous and were very friendly and thorough. Waiters at LaMarea were attentive and knowledgeable. The poolside wait staff seemed oddly stuffy but we didn't deal with them much. FOOD/DRINKS The food was very fresh and had great flavor for the most part. We had room service, ate poolside, and dined at La Marea twice. The drinks were high quality and I liked the unique cocktail options.

I keep returning to the Tides for the incredible service, the unique jungle / beach atmosphere, and the small resort feel. I really like that the resort is always working to improve and maintain the villas and areas. There were many concerns about the rocky beach and road into the resort. Now both have been improved. There is a new road going in and the new pier is very nice. At the end of the pier, you can go into the water and bypass the rocky entrance from the beach area right in front. I, personally, like the rocky look in that it has a \"post card\" quality when you sit on the beach under the hut areas and gaze out. My recommendation at this resort is to speak up and talk to the staff to make sure that they accommodate what you want. The resort is on the expensive side so you want to make sure to take them up on the incredible service. I love Diet Dr Pepper and always miss it on vacations. I mentioned this to the staff and within a day, they had gone out to the grocery store to get Diet Dr Pepper. I ask for additional citronella candles at my villa and even asked to have the heat on my villa pool turned up to a cozy temperature. They are so accommodating to anything you want. This is one of the most special items about the resort. So don\u2019t be shy with any of your request to make the stay perfect. I'm also not shy about the cost of things. I tell them I don\u2019t want to pay for bottled water during my stay and after one time telling them this.......I get the house water at no cost (which is purified). There is one negative item about the resort - the air conditioners and villa pool equpment. You can hear them run when you are in your villa. Not sure what they can do about that in that I would definitely want AC. I cant speak much to where to go outside the resort. I go to stay within the resort and tend to hang around there for my stay. I use the writing area; sit in the painting area, and just chill. The spa is good and they often run specials. The 4-handed massage is unique to Mexico and a treat. Beware, the ladies give a hard massage. I had to tell them to tone it down fo me. It is a quieter, mature setting which I appreciate in that I'm not looking for \"the wildest beer contest\" when I\u2019m on vacation.

My wife and i visited here for 4 days for our honeymoon in sept, 10. we then stayed in a big all inclusive for 3 more nights but the all inclusive couldn't come close to the tides. we stayed during the construction of the pier and pool. we knew some construction was going to be happening and it was a little noisy during the day. My wife and I were the only guests on the entire resort during our stay as the tides was closed but still accomodated us. we were the first guests in 3 weeks. initially the tides was going to move our reservation to a different hotel bc of construction as they did with their other guests, but i wanted to stay here and only here. one of my best friends stayed here a year before and couldn't stop raving of the place. since it was our honeymoon, it was amazing to have the entire resort to simply us. we were treated first class the entire time. they move us into the presidential suite for free and we really had 5-10 people waiting on us at all times. i felt bad that they staffed the resort just to accomodate us but we really enjoyed the celebrity treatment. the rooms are fantastic, the nicest beds i've ever slept in a hotel. and I travel a lot (spend a hundred nights a year in hotels across the US for work). the plunge pools are a wonderful private retreat. wifi worked great in rooms and across the resort. the pool was just completed when we arrived so we had it all to ourselves, it is small but large enough for the resort. amazing views and great lounge chairs. the beach was great to relax and read a book. we spent the majority of our day under one of the beach bungalows. the resort has many spots for privacy and comfort on the beach. there is no fighting for chairs or towels here, everything is well planned and the service is right there when you need them yet far away to not intrude. dining. the food here is outstanding. The chef met with us on arrival and prepared a menu specifically for us, we told her what we liked and they took it from there. We ate every meal during the 4 days here and each was delicious. warning, the food is on the expensive side, be prepared to spend $50 on lunch and $100-$200 on dinner. on our next stay we will probably visit the little restaurant right on the beach next door as they serve tacos, burgers, etc on the cheap just to save a little money. I did have the best club sandwich of my life for lunch one day so I'm going to request that again maybe for room service on our next stay. the tides offers a dinner on the beach which is quite magical. we did the grill which was a feast, shrimp, filet, chicken, pork, lobster... it was amazing. it was the most romantic dinner my wife and i have ever had. we probably will do it again on our next stay. the service is outstanding and the wine is great. we are heavy drinkers on vacation and the resort had us covered regardless of the time of day or location on the resort. i don't drink tequila either but on our honeymoon we tried many kinds and I enjoyed it all. the breakfest is awesome, they give you a wonderful plate of fruit and a basket of fresh baked crossaints/breads for free in the morning. it is definately enough so you don't have to buy breakfest. i had some good tacos one day for lunch and they made some spicy chicken wings just for me. again, we didn't have a menu as we were the only guests so we just told them what we felt like and they knocked it out of the park. I also did the banana leaf \"grill\" which was very good, a little unusual. It is 5 star quality food and the price is reflective. other items; i would say this is a place for lovers and not big time partyiers. you can definately party (tequila bar) but i can't imagine this place pumping loud music and turning into the typical club scene. this is definatley a place for those who enjoy relaxation and pampering. the pier was being built when we were there so we didn't get into the ocean much, it is rocky to walk through as is every other mexican resort i've been too so i'm excited to jump off the pier on our next trip. tipping is appreciated and not forgotten. these guys work tirelessly with a smile and i always tipped pretty heavy to show my appreciation for their outstanding service. however, never was a tip asked for. we didn't use the spa while we where there so i can't remark upon it. try the sweat lodge though, it was cool experience and it made me feel better after too many tequila shots the night before. if you want to explore mexico, there is a guy right next to the resort that stays onthe beach, they can arrange for trips to the ruins, atv trips, boating, snorkeling, so it's close. the tides gave us a free 3 night stay due to the construction inconvienence also. it didn't bother me but i am so excited to go back. our first stay here was the greatest vacation of my life (honeymoon makes it special) and i can't wait to go back. we have other vacations planned this year including san miguel, mx, Venice, Amsterdam, and paris but we really can't wait to come back to the tides.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Metro Detroit", "Title": "\u201cIn a word ... superb!\u201d", "Author": "steves_scuba_girl", "ReviewID": "UR101797838", "Content": "Everything about The Tides Riviera Maya was fabulous!

What I can tell you is that this place is absolutely amazing! If you do your research, understand the type of resort you are going to, and if it\u2019s your thing, you will have an absolutely fantastic trip! Another reviewer called it \"Rustic Chic\" and that is just spot on! This is going to be a long review, but I feel it\u2019s worth it so people can know exactly what they are in for. The Villas - you stay in these incredible and VERY private villas with plunge pools, days beds, hammocks, an outdoor shower, and depending on what Villa type, an outdoor sun deck with a few loungers. Inside is a super comfortable bed with incredible sheets, canopy, nice sized bathroom with 2 sinks, indoor shower, dvd and ipod player, big tv, etc. It\u2019s a very private setting, SUPER romantic, and just really unique and special. There can be some mosquitoes, but they provide candles and bug spray. But seriously, it\u2019s the jungle, what do you expect? Not an issue at all, but worth mentioning. Pool - Once you leave your Villa you meander along this pathway, which at first can be confusing, but once you do it once or twice, it\u2019s easy. It eventually opens up to the pool and restaurant area. The pool is nice sized, has plenty of lounge chairs available, but enough space that it\u2019s impossible to feel that anyone is on top of you. That is a big piece of this place, you never feel like its crowded. The pool is really nice, has a cool shape and has the infinity pool type of feel. If that\u2019s your thing, you will be happy. Beach - we are beach people so we spent the majority of the trip on the beach and under one of the amazing palapas. There are about 8 or 9 and there always seemed to be enough with all the guests on different schedules. There also a bunch of loungers and chairs along the beach that you can use to. There is always a place to lay your head for sure. Overall the beach is beautiful, clean, and peaceful. You will never get hassled by vendors and we always felt safe if we wanted to leave stuff and go grab a bit or take a walk. Keep in mind that it is a public beach, so there are people walking by, but they are not concerned with you and just enjoying the day. Ocean - if you have read some of the reviews, some might mention that the ocean itself is much more rocky than sandy, this is true. They do provide reef shoes for you to wear, which you will want to, and then it\u2019s no issue. While a sandy ocean would be better, it really was no big deal. If you were bothered by it, you can walk 150 yards down the beach and there is an all sandy area. They also have a beautiful pier that goes out into the ocean which you can jump off of and use the ladder to get out. So really, there are plenty of ways for you to enjoy the water with or without the rocks being a factor. I thought the rocks actually helped keep the area more peaceful as it would not be an optimal place for people not staying at the resort to hang out. Hanging Day Beds - right off the sand they have 4 or 5 amazing day beds hanging that are fantastic for late day napping after you spent all day in the sun. Such a treat. Excursions - We like to stay on the beach mostly during our trips but we did go with their dive master, Pepe, on a snorkeling trip. It was a blast. We went to the Cenotes, these underground fresh water caves and then out to the ocean to swim with the sea turtles. It was a bit pricey for the private trip, but it was a great experience and we felt worth it. Pepe also took us into Playa del Carmen to have lunch at one of his favorite places, so eating what the locals eat was a treat. Pepe was super nice, knowledgeable, and a great guide. Spa - this is a really unique spa. I would call it more of a ceremony room than your typical spa. It\u2019s not what you would get at the Ritz or Four Seasons, a completely unique experience. Very peaceful. We each got a massage and it was a great treatment. Nothing out of the ordinary, but just a really good massage. The prices were up there, but it\u2019s what you would expect from a nice resort. A little tip is when you are on the beach, if you look to the left there is a couple offering massages on the beach for $45 an hour, and that was absolutely incredible. They do hot stone as part of their treatment, and with the sound of the waves crashing, it was really amazing. Two VERY different experiences, but if you are watching your wallet, it\u2019s a perfect substitute. In fact, had I gone to them first, I might not of gone to the Spa. Restaurant - Overall the food was pretty good. We did the all-inclusive package for the convenience and since we also heard good things. Like with most places, some stuff was really good, some stuff was ok, but fortunately nothing was bad. We tried everything on the menu more or less and certainly had our favorites and stuff we weren't partial too. They are VERY flexible and will pretty much make whatever you want. We had seviche nearly every day for lunch and it was always fresh and delicious. We also went with the specials as those were usually really good traditional dishes. I cannot really speak about the prices, but I imagine they were your 'standard relatively expensive nice resort' prices. All nice resorts are expensive when it comes to food, it\u2019s just the nature of the beast and should not come as a surprise. One thing we appreciated though was how seriously they took your satisfaction and how accommodating they were. If anything was not to your liking, they would immediately correct it in any way you wanted them too. Also, if they do a special and you want it the next day, as long as they have the ingredients, it\u2019s never a problem. One thing to remember, the resort is not in the center of Playa del Carmen, but a 15 minute or so cab ride. So there are not many dining options in the immediate area. Service - one thing I want to make clear is that when they refer you having a 'butler,' keep in mind they are not talking about Mr. Belvedere. It\u2019s basically a concierge that will take care of excursions, spa appointments and pretty much anything else, but it\u2019s not like they stand there and wait for you to tell them what to do. There are plenty of other staff that will do the exact same thing if you want, but the Butler greets you when you arrive, takes you on the tour, and gets you settled. Overall the service is really good. As with any resort there will be some staff that are better than others, but for the most part, everyone there made sure you were taken care of and always had exactly what you needed. There were a few that went above and beyond, Donnie for example. But everyone really made sure that all you had to worry about was remembering to put on sun block. They also paid attention to what you liked and didn't like. The Grounds - absolutely beautiful. The paths through the jungle are really peaceful, there are some iguanas hanging around, once in a while you might see a monkey, and there are all these little nooks if you wanted to go paint, read, sleep, or whatever. Overall, this place is really quiet, peaceful and romantic. Not really the place to meet other couples to hang out and if you are looking for a \"scene\" or a place with action, games, etc, this is NOT the place. Not really a place for teenagers either as they will likely be the only ones. If you are looking to celebrate something or get away to relax and escape from whatever it is you want to escape from, this is 100% the place for you.

After playing Indiana Jones, it was the perfect place to relax and to enjoy the company of your spouse or partner. The grounds are gorgeous--basically, you are living in a lush jungle complete with spider monkees. The rooms are separate detached units with plunge pools providing extraordinary privacy. We booked a Saasil Villa---which have even more seclusion than the others and we think it was worth it--it just seemed more remote since it was farther off the main pathways. I am sure the other villas are fine too but we liked being tucked away. There do not appear to be any waterfront units but this is more than made up for by the privacy of each of the unit's little compounds. The service was great for breakfast, lunch, and anything beach-related, whether it was drinks or just to move your lounger. Many of the staff have earphones and communicate frequently so that they can run to help you--the culture is of the staff is to anticipate your needs rather than react to them--and they really succeed. The staff members all know your name and by the time you check out, you realize that you are truly going to miss these fine people. The only area where there some bumps in the road service-wise were some of the dinner services--of the four nights we dined there, the service on one night mirrored all of the other perfect service we received at other meals and on the beach. The other three nights, the dinner service was a little off--the delays between courses were a little long ( too long to make personal preference the issue) and it did take a while one night to get our order in. This is the ONLY reason the Tides is getting a four star rating from me and not a five star rating, Everything else was so perfect that maybe the bumpy dinner service stood out more. In any event, the service at the Tides is generally so excellent that I would tell you not let my comments concerning dinner service dissuade you from staying here. On the contrary, it would be a mistake not to stay at the Tides. We found the all-inclusive Mayan Indulgence package to be a good value for us since we like to enjoy good food and drink--something in which the Tides specializes. The duck confit I had one night was better than what I have had in Paris and the ceviche was glorious. Heck, even the hamburger was darned good! We had also considered staying at the Banyan Tree, Mandarin Oriental, and Grand Velas and had the opportunity to walk by them and view them from the beach. I assume that the service and cuisine at these resorts is great and the accomodations are lovely so I will only speak to their architecture--a matter of personal preference. For me, the architecture of the Banyon Tree and Mandarin that I observed did not give me that \"I am in Mexico\" feel like the Tides did. The Grand Velas did give off that Mexican or Latin vibe . It was much, much larger than the Tides--albeit very lovely with a great stretch of beach. In the end, the Tides was the right place for us since it was beautiful, romantic, and its design made us feel like we were in Mexico. We really liked its boutique feel as well as tthe other attributes described above.

Rooms: All are villa style with private pool. High end bedding and bathroom amenities. Excellent electronics so bring the IPOD or CD's. Nice Stocked Bar In Room. Pool/Beach: Small resort so plenty of loungers by pool and beach and enough staff to be waited on promptly. Spa: I've seen grander spa with the acres of marble but this spa was very cool in a junglely way. The spa menu was outstanding and your massage experience was outdoors. I highly recommend you treat yourself to anything at the spa, well worth the price. Food: Not very good. Since we were staying in a villa furtherest from the restaurant our room service meals were not warm and I understand that, it's okay, but the food overall was very bland and we learned from another couple the woman chef the summer before was no longer there. Spice it up yall, you don't have to dumb down the food for American palates. Grounds/Location: Isolated but in a good way. The Tides focus was on the jungle not the beach so I feel it's unique in comparison to other Playa Del Carmen resorts/hotels. It's one of a kind. You're less than an hour ride from Cancun Airport & 20 minutes from downtown Playa Del Carmen. You'd be closer to Playa Del Carmen if they paved the road to the main highway.

When you first turn off of the main highway and hit the dirt road, you may question yourself as to just what you got yourself into...all of that will quickly go away as the Mayodoro Staff sweeps you away into the jungle to show you your own private, secluded, bungalow, with a beautiful terrace featuring a hammock, plunge pool and outdoor shower (don't worry, there is indoor plumbing, too!) Then, as soon as you feel as though you are in the jungle...the jungle opens up to a beautiful beach, phenomenal pool and great restaurant area.

The staff truly anticipates your needs, from noticing that you didn't use the grape jam in the morning, and leaving you more of the kind that you did use, to appearing from what seems to be out of nowhere to adjust your chair, whether pool or beachside. The food is truly phenomenal...if you like Chilaquiles, for breakfast, try them with the chicken and red sauce...FAB-U-Lous! As a girl that hails from Texas, and a true lover of Mexican food, my approval should say alot!

We hope to return sometime soon. Until then, we can say, without a doubt that the entire staff is there to serve you...afterall, they will tell you that it's their pleasure to serve you, as long as you are there, \"it's your home\"...and their dedication to that thought process shows in every way!!", "Date": "August 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Jungle Elegance\u201d", "Author": "NYC_27", "ReviewID": "UR72412789", "Content": "First of all, the Tides Riviera Maya is a beautiful resort. It is set in the rainforest/jungle and is laid out in a way that there are 30 villas nestled in the jungle in such a way that each villa is completey private and isolated from the others. A narrow stone path runs through the resort and eventually leads to the ocean/beach and restaurant area. The resort is perfect for a honeymoon or a couple wanting to spend some quiet alone time getting away from the world. It is extremely relaxing and very private. In fact, my husband and I only saw other guests at dinner and ocassionally at the pool- other than that, we felt like we had the resort to ourselves. The only real downside is that because the villas are in the rainforest/jungle, there are a number of mosquitos and creepy crawlies around. The resort is great about providing mosquito spray and citronella candles, but I would have to say that to be comfortable at this resort you really have to be ok about seeing the ocassional centipede or beetle crawling around your villa (they get in under the doors which have wide gaps). Also, because the villas roofs are thatched, birds often nest in them, so at times you may hear loud chirping or bird noises as the birds are just on top of your villa's roof. I don't mean to overstate the bug issue-- but I am from New York City and am fairly squeamish about nature in general, so I just had to get used to the idea that there were some bugs (however inoffensive) sharing my villa with me. The service at the resort was OUTSTANDING. I cannot express how fantastic all of the waiters, bartenders, servers were. They absolutely made our stay. In addition, the food was superb. My only recommendation is that you stick to seafood and Mexican influenced options because that is where the food really shines. Don't miss the \"La Marea Ceviche, the Sea Bass Tostadas or the Shrimp Tacos\" which were all AMAZING. The more European influenced options available at dinner were underwhelming, and my suggestion is that you ask them to make you something from the lunch menu or a more Mexican influenced option as these are really the stars. Also, I would highly recommend doing the $120 a day three meal plan which includes everything except alcoholic beverages. The food, and especially things like water, and other non-alcoholic beverages really add up, so the plan is a bargain.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake County, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious Seclusion\u201d", "Author": "CrankiestOne", "ReviewID": "UR71639972", "Content": "We spent nine perfect nights at The Tides and highly recommend this resort for a romantic, secluded vacation. This resort met every one of our requirements when we were looking for a vacation--seclusion, privacy, pampering and relaxation--I wanted to be dropped in the middle of nowhere and left alone. We found all of that and never left the resort during our stay. In reading the reviews I noted there was a dramatic change when the resort changed hands, so much so that TripAdvisor should probably give The Tides a fresh start rather than burdening its overall review with its predecessor's errors. We had a concern with our villa in that in we could hear another guest talking, as if he were right next door (and he didn't seem to ever stop talking!). We were promptly offered a different villa, which we accepted. Since we had already unpacked, we arranged to have our belongings moved while we were at dinner. When we arrived in our new villa, I realized that I'd left a \"personal massage item\" in the nightstand drawer. I made an awkward call to the \"front desk\" to see if I could get back into our original villa to retrieve the item; our hostess indicated she would be glad to retrieve it for me, then called back to let me know that the \"item\" was in the same location in our new villa as it had been in our original villa! A funny, embarassing way to find out that The Tides is serious when it comes to customer care! We thought the restaurant food was delicious, although I felt the wine prices were a bit steep. We drank wine with dinner every night, however, and enjoyed the recommendations of our server, Carlos. I am still waiting to receive recipes for the shrimp tacos and lime soup. :) Our villa was perfect. The outdoor shower was our favorite part. I knew I was in paradise showering under the stars with my handmade soap. It's hard to believe something so simple could make such an impact, but if I lived in a warmer climate I'd be looking for a way to install an outdoor shower at home! The outdoor patio and pool is completely private and we enjoyed skinny dipping throughout our stay. We had a fantastic couples' massage at the spa, and I had a mani/pedi. All of the services were performed professionally, and the staff was obviously concerned with our well-being. The best thing The Tides has going for it are the staff. We could ask any staff member for anything at all and it would be handled. Our flashlight keychain fell apart and the servers at dinner replaced it. My requested grapefruit juice at breakfast came delivered to our villa as fresh squeezed grape juice; when I asked at lunch the next day for the Spanish word for grapefruit and explained what happened, our server made sure to have ti corrected. When we decided we wanted to stay one more night since our week started out with rain from Alex, our butler Alberto called the airline to get our options and then called them to change our reservations. Staff members that we'd never met would greet us by name throughout the week. The Tides provided a place to reconnect, relax and completely focus on ourselves.

Yes, it is quite expensive, but so are the other top 2-3 resorts on the Riviera Maya. I gave the Tides 5 stars for value despite the expense because i think you get even more than you pay for. Mistakes will happen at even the best resort, and how one deals with the mistake really shows the character of the staff. Our shower drain was blocked and workers had to come in and tear apart our bathroom. All of our things were moved piece by piece to another villa and placed in their exact same positions; the next morning we were upgraded to a better villa very close to the beach, again not having to lift a finger. On the night I proposed, we came back to the villa to find beautiful flowers tied to each bedpost, a cold bottle of (nice) champagne waiting, and rose petals spread across the bed and floor. The hotel also generously compensated me for our beachfront romantic dinner due to the \"inconvenience\" of switching rooms (I think I carried my iPod and they moved the rest). We started the trip off with the tequila and ceviche tasting (it was a GREAT start to the trip) and the beachfront dinner was wonderful.

If you\u2019re having fantasies about a quiet romantic beach-side resort, this is it. What sets the Tides apart is the vibe. This place is not about \u201cflash\u201d and \u201cglitz\u201d you (as a few of the other 5 star properties in the area are trying to do). It is quiet. It is very romantic. It is a bit casual. It is intimate. It is focused on the beach. And it is beautiful. For us, that was a perfect combination. During our recent 2 week trip, we actually stayed at both the Rosewood and the Tides. Both are fantastic, but my wife and I DEFINITELY preferred the Tides. A few thoughts: Service: Wow. They have this completely perfected. The people at the Tides were unbelievably warm, kind and generous. They are also shockingly attuned to giving you the type of experience you want to have. Want to be friendly and chat? No problem. Want to be left alone? Absolutely fine. Want to be formal? It would be there pleasure. They just have a great sense offering the type of experience that you want. My friend Manuel the bartender gets especially high marks for making our stay so great. It is clear that the Tides has hired kind and talented people, and doesn\u2019t make them follow a pre-programed script. There is a clear desire throughout the staff to make guests\u2019 experience as perfect possible. Atmosphere: This was just what we wanted. While other resorts in the area are HUGE and beautiful (Rosewood, Banyan Tree, Fairmont, etc), they are surprisingly less oriented to the ocean than you\u2019d expect. The Tides, by comparison, is much smaller, and has this perfect oceanfront \u201cbarefoot in the sand\u201d feeling. And you know how some resorts are too crowded, while others are too empty? Well this one found the perfect middle ground. Although nearly full during our stay, and there were always people around and a good \u201cbuzz\u201d , but it never felt crowded or congested. I think \u201cintimate\u201d would be the right word. Rooms: Cozy, private, romantic. Relatively simple, but absolutely wonderful. Definitely has the perfect jungle-getaway feel. The bathrooms are a little bit on the smallish side, but that\u2019s not a huge complaint. Loved the outdoor shower. Food: If I could give one piece of constructive feedback to the Tides, it would be about their restaurant. The food at breakfast and lunch was very good, but dinner was consistently a bit . . . lacking. We ate dinner there three times and always walked away underwhelmed. The service was attentive and the setting is the most beautiful we saw during our trip, but the dishes just weren\u2019t particularly flavorful or memorable. As seems to frequently be the case at hotels in the Riviera Maya area, they try to serve fancier European style food, rather than fully embrace the fact that Mexico has such a rich food history and culture. I\u2019d love to see the menu be reworked to have much more Yucatan and Mexican influence and more spice, which \u2013 quite frankly \u2013 would help further distinguish this wonderful property from its competition in the area. Beach: The entire area benefits from soft white sand and turquoise waters, but I do think the Tides beach is a just a little more beautiful than the rest. I can\u2019t quite put my finger on why that\u2019s the case, but it was gorgeous. Their beach front palapas were great (a huge benefit for somebody as fair-skinned as me). I read some reviews complaining about the rocks/reef in front of the beach, but getting in and out of the water was easy. If you wear the hotel\u2019s water shoes, you\u2019ll be fine. Other stuff Mosquitoes: Apparently May/June is a bad time across region for mosquitoes. The places we visited all did their best to manage it, but . . . it is a fact of life in the area (you are, after all, in the middle of a mangrove marsh/swamp). Mosquitoes are plentiful, and apparently hungry, particularly between 7pm and 9pm. Weather: 90 and mostly sunny during the day, mid-70s at night. Definitely warm and muggy. And the sun is INTENSE down there! Use stronger a SPF sunscreen than you typically use! Many of the people met were getting burned much more quickly than expected (including my wife). Getting Around: We rented a car to go down and see Tulum. Easy driving, not scary at all. I\u2019d definitely do it again for a day-trip. I\u2019d also recommend taking taxis around the area (instead of hotel driven cars). Much cheaper, very clean, safe and air conditioned. Playa Del Carmen: More interesting than I expected. I\u2019d definitely recommend visiting the 5th street area at night, when it is cooler and has more going on. The shops are all open late 7 days a week. Food Options in the Area: Really liked Casa Largo at the Rosewood. Great food, attentive service, nice atmosphere, and relatively reasonable prices. We tried Ambar at the Mandarin and were VERY disappointed. $35+ for entrees, robotic service and the food was very mediocre (plus the room had absolutely no sense of being in Mexico), consider yourself warned. Had a forgettable dinner at the Banyan Tree\u2019s ocean-front Mexican restaurant too. We really liked the food at El Fogon a popular place for locals in Playa Del Carmen. Next time we go, we\u2019ll also try dinner at the Orient Express Maroma which looked beautiful (and we heard good things from other couples). Construction: I read a few older reviews on this site citing noise from construction nearby the Tides property. I THINK that was coming from the hotel property next door, which now appears to be complete. For what it\u2019s worth, we didn\u2019t hear any construction noise. Just the sound of the waves and the palm trees in the wind. Bottom line, there are other hotels in the area that boast about bigger rooms, fancy cigar bars, wine cellars stocked with rare wine, more highly acclaimed chefs, and/or other allegedly important stuff. But honestly, who cares about those things? All of those places lack soul when compared to the Tides. When I\u2019m in Mexico I want a great beach, friendly service, a welcoming room, and a relaxing experience. The Tides absolutely delivers on all of those. We\u2019re counting the days until we go back.

Spent several days before hand at the Royal in Playa del Carmen. Biggest mistake was not spending all the nights at The Tides. The Royal was fine (see review), but The Tides is almost perfect. Went for 23-year wedding anniversary and wanted to relax, spend some quality couple time in a warm place. Mexico is a great option for us out of Texas with direct flights and easy accomodations. This is not the first area we think about romantic. Usually Mexico means crowds, partying and such. Now that we found The Tides we have seen a different side that competes with the carribean. Arrival and check-in is interesting. Our cab driver kept asking where we were going as we went up the dirt roads. Hang in there! You drive into an open air drop off where you are met by a host and your bags are wisked off to your room. The host walks you through the property. This usually annoys me but the way the resort is laid out it is necessary and fun. The grounds are jungle-like. It is manicured buy not like most of the resorts. You get a real sense of solitude as you walk the paths. After the tour of the grounds (about 15-minutes), we were informed our room was not quite ready. It was lunch time so we had a great lunch on the beach under the roof of the casual restaurant. The food was great and the location was unbelievable. The first thing you notice is the beach is not crowded at all. The guest areas are scattered all around the beach to give lots of room and privacy. If you want a sheltered area, you got it. Want a sunny area - you get that too. No fighting, saving or other goofy activities. If you go about 1/2-mile in either direction there are some large resorts, but foot traffic on The Tides beach is minimal. Just enough to be interesting. Great walking in both directions. The beach area has lots of exposed rocks so beach shoes are required (and supplied). I did go out into the gulf one day and the water was rough but very fun and refreshing (too cold for the wife). Right after lunch we went to our \"hut\". All the rooms are stand-alone villas that are great. They are private as you walk through the property. If you dont know what you are looking for you will miss the entrances (which is the point). The first thing you notice is the plunge pool, patio and outdoor sitting area. I didnt need to go inside after seeing this. The pool is big enough and was heated (big deal for the wife). The outdoor area had a hammock, cushoined lounge chairs and a nice table/chair area which was where breakfast was set-up each morning. The whole area is surronded by lush jungle. Total privacy. The inside was great also. First the sliding entrance is mahogany doors that are huge. It slides open to reveal the bedroom area. Of course they had the bed covered in flowers and anniversary greetings. The room had a large TV/entertainment cabinet which also housed the mini-bar and safe area. Great furniture - elegant and dark. All the windows had louvered mahagony shutters. The bath area continued the experience. 2-sinks and lots of cabinet room. Mirror was edged in windows that brought in the light. Huge tiled shower that had a door that walked out to an outdoor shower area that was private and lush. Very cool throughout. The next few days we spent waking up around 8am to birds and monkey calls. Had continental breakfast on the patio watching the birds and igaunas. By 9 we were on the beach in a great location with both covered and sunning chairs. when you walked to the beach you were escorted to open areas and your chairs were wrapped in towels. Over the next several hours read and relaxed. Servers were by often to check for drinks and such. Lunch we wondered up to the casual area and had some great local mexican flair. Shrimp tacos and quesadillas were our favorites. Afternoons spent back at the \"hut\" taking in the pool and outdoor areas in total privacy. Dinner was always great. The dinner area is near the beach. There is a great upstairs bar that we missed the first night. We were invited up later to have a glass of champagne looking over the beach. Food was top-notch. Had a very good rib-eye. Wife had lamb. Both done very well. Good wine list. Dinner was again very private. there were some other couples but everyone was well spaced out and enjoying private time. We did not partake of the spa but it looked great. No nightlife other than hanging with your sweetie. It is about 15-minutes into Playa or 5-minutes to some mega resorts if you need a party fix. If you need some quality time with your significant other - this is the place. Couple of points: 1) This is not all-inclusive. It is not over the top expensive but most people going to Mexico think AI first. The meals are worth it (lunch around $20/pp - dinner around $50/pp). 2) Buy airport transports on-line prior to going. I used Cancun Transfers and for $120/rt they picked us up in Chevy Suburban and wisked us straight to and from. The hotel will offer to do it for twice the amount. Just tell them you will spend the money on food and booze! 3) Dont tell my wife but they had free wifi throughout the property. Patched iPhone in and was able to keep up.

I was a little nervous about traveling to Mexico while pregnant, but The Tides turned out to be the perfect spot for our trip! The villas were beautiful, roomy and isolated. We spent a lot of time in our splash pool and my husband enjoyed the outdoor shower. The beds were very comfortable and housekeeping was impeccable. The rest of the facilities were also lovely, with a great pool and beach. We both had excellent spa treatments, and I was very impressed by the prenatal massages. One of our favorite parts of our stay was the food. The food was out of this world amazing at the hotel, particularly the dinners. Although it is pricey, it was completely worth it -- fresh, flavorful and well presented. We both felt that we had some of the best meals that we had ever eaten. In addition, the ingredients were very high quality and I felt very safe eating all the food. All of the cheese that they serve is pasteurized and the staff was great about answering all of my questions in detail. The hotel definitely places an emphasis on service and that showed in all aspects of our stay. The staff were all very sweet about my pregnancy and extremely accommodating. In particular, the waitstaff at the restaurant are delightful. They were always bringing me extra cushions and and would make me a different, surprise nonalcoholic drink every night. One morning I ordered a breakfast with food that I wasn't supposed to eat while pregnant (my mistake). While my husband ate it, the staff made me a completely new breakfast to order for free. In addition, the hotel provides you as much filtered or bottled water as you need in your room and there is bottled water scattered around the grounds as well (all complimentary). We went on one excursion with the dive master, Pepe, to snorkel in a cenote (freshwater cavern). It was a delightful trip and Pepe was a wonderful guide. Otherwise, we mostly just relaxed. The hotel is definitely ideal for couples and spending romantic time together. There really isn't a nightlife or a lot of socializing between guests (although everyone staying there was very friendly). We did go into Playa del Carmen one night and found it loud, tacky and the food mediocre. Factoring in the taxi fare ($16-$20) each way, we felt it was not worth the trip at all.

I didn't lift a finger the entire time, the staff is very intuitive and accommodating.

I had never been on a vacation like this, drink service on the beach and pool, excellent room service, and a great outdoor feeling, I literally felt like I was in the middle of the jungle. The WOW moment: I was tanning at the beach, and I stood up to turn onto my stomach, and before I even got to the back of the chair to lower it down, a staff member was there doing it for me, re-fluffing my pillow and apologizing for not getting there sooner. Ha! Bad things: During our first night, we were enjoying our private pool when two of our neighbors accidentally walked right into our villa area! It turned out there was a small path leading behind our villa that our neighbors mistook for a shortcut. We asked the staff repeatedly to please block off the path in order to ensure our privacy, and every time we asked, they ensured us that something would be done, but nothing ever was. I was paranoid the whole week about someone walking in on us again; for how private and secluded the hotel boasts to be, it certainly falls short in that respect. Also, the food was just okay. I guess I'm just spoiled living in New Orleans, but I was not impressed by the majority of food. Absolutely stay away from the sandwich meat if you go, it's cheap and disgusting.

We were able to get an amazing rate of less than half of the rack rate, so it was an absolute steal. Keep in mind that taxes here are nearly 30% on top of the rate. The hotel-arranged transportation was pricey but was a very nice Suburban with friendly and efficient drivers. As other reviewers have mentioned, the off-highway roads they take to get to the resort are less than attractive compared to the Mayakoba resorts, but once you're there it doesn't really matter (especially if you don't come and go much). The villa...incredible. Simple yet upscale, private pool (more like a big spa), great bath and outdoor shower. Be sure to have them adjust the temperature of the pool to your liking and check that they've actually adjust it, as ours ended up cold half the time and scalding hot for most of the remainder. Service was very attentive and friendly from start to finish, and we were mostly satisfied with the food at the resort. Compared to other reviewers' comments I actually thought the prices were rather reasonable vs. what I was expecting from an upscale resort. Not inexpensive, but not outrageous like other places I've stayed. I'll also differ from some others in saying that the Friday seafood/meat cookout, while good enough, was very disappointing at around $300 for two with a couple drinks apiece. The beach is rocky, but they provide shoes and the sand is perfectly nice. The beach service for drinks can be slow, but always friendly with good name recognition. Faster drink service would've been appreciated, but we were on vacation and had all day, so adjusting out of work mode and learning to be patient was good for us. :-) At the right rate, The Tides is an amazing value. I wouldn't mind trying one of the other upscale area resorts, though they tend to be very expensive and extremely spread out. Half of the rooms at the Rosewood and Mandarin Oriental required a call to get a golf cart pick-up then ride down to the beach. The numerous screaming children in the Rosewood pool made us thankful for the peaceful oasis that was The Tides.

We considered a number of five star properties in the Playa del Carmen area like the Rosewood but decided on the Tides since it seemed more intimate. It was. The Villa we had was amazing. We almost did not want to leave it (and we have been married for seven years). It was large and very comfortable with a small pool (more like a big hot tub), outdoor shower as well as a large bathroom with ample closet space. We loved that they brought us continental breakfast every morning and left it for us in our private outside area. The restaurants were good. They serve breakfast and lunch at the pool side restaurant and dinner in the main restaurant where you can eat inside or outside. The food was menu was good and they change the dinner menu every night. The service at the Tides was excellent. The staff was very friendly, spoke English well and was responsive. The Spa was a disappointment. It is nice enough in terms of its layout but it somehow did not work for me, maybe because or Villa was so wonderful. My massage was mediocre and my wife's was bad. Frankly, I have never really had a great massage in Mexico but for the price I was paying, I thought the Tides might be different. Speaking of price: The Tides is very expensive. Meals and drinks are make you feel you are in Europe or at least in an expensive part of the USA. You have to take a taxi unless you have a car if you want to go to any of the other high end hotels close by or into town. It always cost $16 even if it is a ten minute ride to the Rosewood. The bad news is the beach. The Tides occupies a piece of land the pushes out a bit into the sea. It is very rocky and you have to wire special shoes to go out into the water which the hotel provides. If you want a more normal beach you can walk five or ten minutes but then you do not have an beach chairs etc. There are some very large hotels about ten minutes on each side of the tides with 100s if not more people. I had a feeling that this were all inclusive hotels with lots of Europeans on package deals. We had lots of wind when we were there and cool weather. I think this was unusual and certainly effected our ability to enjoy the beach. The town of Playa del Carmen was a great disappointment. I somehow thought it would be smaller and less built up.

This trip was my third visit to this resort. I\u2019m a traveler who usually likes to visit a resort twice and then it seems to loss its charm. So was a little concerned the Tides would not live up to the expectation for a 3rd time. However that was not the case. Not only did the Tides meet expectations they exceeded my expectations which is often not easy to do with me. As I travel quiet often to the Caribbean and Mexico, I am starting to see the affects of the recession in the way the resorts are being maintained \u2013 or should I say \u201cnot\u201d maintained. However, this is not the case at the Tides. I was so pleased so see that this resort is listening to the comments of the guests and providing upgrades that make the resort so nice. New lighting has been provided in the Villas, more plantings and vegetation added for enhanced privacy of the Villas, and some nice extras in the outdoor shower areas have also been provided. Some thoughts that may not have been mentioned on other reviews - - Don\u2019t be shy about asking what costs what. I like to know what I am paying for so I openly ask the staff and let them know what my preferences are. I also asked them to provide my food charges at the end of the day, not for each meal in that I didn\u2019t want to review the bill more than once a day. If they know your requests, they will certainly accommodate the request. I really enjoy sitting outside at night at the Villa, so I asked for additional citronella candles and they arrived in about 5 minutes. They are very responsive to your requests so that you have the best vacation ever. I also heard a few guests speaking about how nice their pool was in that they requested it to stay a warmer temperature during the evening. I would also recommend at least one treatment at the spa in that the expereince was really good! A reminder that the ocean in front of the resort has more of a \u201cwest Mexico feel\u201d and is more rocky \u2013 very pretty but rocky. Just walk up the beach about 50 yards and there is a great open white sandy beach area that is great for swimming. It is just as nice as Maroma Beach with pretty clear water. The staff is exceptional at this resort. I started going to this resort two years ago and did enjoy seeing the same people working there as before and \u2013 yes \u2013 they did remember me from my other visits!

While we were a little unsure as we were arriving to the property because of the bumpy road and questionable location it seemed we were heading, from the moment we stepped out of the car at the Tides we were completely spoiled. Oscar greeted us and provided a cool towel and beverage, and proceeded to show us the resort and to our room. It seemed as if he knew personally every guest that he spoke to along our tour, and we quickly found out that that is indeed how it became for us. You really do come to know all of the staff on a first name basis, and I was always surprised how Manuel, the beach bartender, always remembered EXACTLY how we liked our margaritas. He would even bring us one down to the beach according to our personal tastes before we could ever even get up to ask for it. But that sums up the Tides Riviera Maya perfectly. I regret that I cannot remember the server who was in the outdoor restaurant by name, but he was just as wonderful and seemed to remember what on the menu we had already tried and could suggest something different so that we were able to try everything. And speaking of the food....absolutely delicious. Now my husband and I are more adventurous in our eating preferences and subscribe to the \"When in Rome...\" philosophy, so if you are the type to want a hamburger or ribeye while on vacation out of the US, you may not be so delighted with the food. It is delicious but is very authentic, which is one reason we both loved it so much. I live near Memphis and enjoy barbecue there, but would never expect for it to be wonderful in some other vacation spots. Going back to the service, if you decide you would like breakfast by the pool, or lunch on the beach, they will completely set up for you to enjoy your meal. Out comes a table, linens, silverware....they completely pamper you. The spa is beautiful and serene and the treatments I had, which included a couples massage and a facial, were wonderful. They will even send someone down to find you on the beach to remind you of your appointment. Overall, if I had to nitpick, two of the four cardio machines in the small gym were not working while we were there as I did try to keep some sort of exercise regime while I was there. I never tried the yoga but definitely will make a point of it if I ever have the opportunity to return, which I fully plan to do.

When we arrived they greeted us by name with a drink and a cold towel. There is no lobby so they take you directly to your own private villa. Our villa was beautiful. We had our own private pool and hammock and our room and bathroom was large and just perfect. The service at The Tides was impeccable.

Since we were vacationing without our 3 kids, this was the perfect destination for relaxation and seclusion. Though this is definitely not the resort to go to if you prefer a robust social atmosphere, it never felt cold or unfriendly. The staff were warm, attentive and stopped often to make conversation. I never felt they were intrusive, but I suppose more private people may feel like they need a little space. For instance, they seemed to magically know our names, even if we hadn't met them personally (which seemed a little weird but didn't bother me). Still, I felt like what they offered was the very best of Mexican culture which is gracious hospitality and the feeling of being family. We didn't have most of the problems that some reviewers have complained about: - Our bill never had erroneous or surprise charges. - We never heard any construction noise except for a small amount one time when we decided to walk the whole hotel grounds to explore. In the far back, there was some construction going on. Mostly there are just a lot of jungle sounds: small animals, birds, trickling water, wind blowing through the trees. There was a thunderstorm one night and the rain and thunder were quite noisy so it was hard to sleep that night. Besides that, it's pretty quiet on the grounds. If I wanted to nitpick, I can think of a couple of minor complaints. - For one, the road to the resort is pretty bad. We had rented a car, so our little \"Ato\" (which didn't have good suspension) didn't take the potholes too well. We tried not to travel the road unless totally necessary. If we were out in town, we wouldn't go back until we were totally ready to settle back in the hotel. A bigger car would probably handle the road better, but it would be great if they could pave it. - Our toilet had plumbing issues the whole time. They would come and \"fix\" it daily, but it never worked well. I know in Mexico, you're not supposed to flush the TP but even so, it seemed like there was some other plumbing issue that wasn't ever really fixed. - As far as cost goes; yeah, for Mexico, the food was very pricey, but it was excellent and we were on vacation, so we splurged and ate at the hotel restaurant a couple of times. The Friday night BBQ on the beach was about $84 per person without drinks, but it was a very memorable and romantic meal. I think it was totally worth it! For other meals, we ate in town at local restaurants and carts and enjoyed many inexpensive, authentic, delicious meals! We also ate a couple times at the Coco's Cabanas restaurant right next door to the hotel. It's a wonderful family owned restaurant and hotel. Definitely check it out! - The spa looked like it would've been great, but I didn't feel like I could pay that much for spa treatments. If you could get a discount, it would probably be worth it. - As others have mentioned, the beach is rocky (and at the time we went, the waves were bigger than I had expected them to be). Definitely drive or take a taxi to Akumal or Yal-ku to snorkel and don't bother trying at the hotel. It's a great beach for sunning and relaxing and catching a beautiful view, but the swimming just didn't seem to do it for us. Besides that, the Tides was a the perfect place for a romantic and relaxing vacation. They think of everything before you even know you need something. They definitely go the extra mile to make sure you feel taken care of. I would love to go back to the Riviera Maya some day, although, most likely, next time we'll be traveling with our kids, so we will have to find a different place to stay. But for couples and those just seeking a beautiful and serene hideaway, this is paradise!", "Date": "August 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201cGreat Experience\u201d", "Author": "ic8520", "ReviewID": "UR34588698", "Content": "We were greeted by our transport company USA Tours, [--]. Cancun has a new modern terminal, however parking is still at terminal 1&2, so once you arrive it is about a 10 min wait for your van. Our transport cost $105 to the Tides and our drivers to and from, Javier and Jose were great. We ended up leaving a bag with my wife's jewelry in it on one of the seats of the van which was returned to us that evening, untouched. I highly recommend using them. After about a 45 minute drive from the airport, we turned onto a long bumpy dirt road which took us to the Tides. Don't be concerned about the approach to the resort, because the final destination is beautiful. We were greeted by a very charming woman, Alihandra and given cold towels and a coconut seagrass drink to sip on as we were given a tour of the facility. The resort consists of 30 private villas set in a jungle atmosphere. They number from 11 to 40 with 11 being the closest to the beach the rest winding back from there. Villa's 18 and 19 have a little closer traffic flow, but you still have ample privacy. The Tides Villa is the \"presidental suite\" which is a two story condo, closest to the pool. Each villa is isololated from the other villas and has its own plung pool and outdoor shower. The rooms are what you would expect from a five star resort, ie, comfortable bed, roomy, nice bathroom, walk in shower and all the lotions and potions. One criticism is the lighting, which is very romantic, however way to dim if you are trying to read or see what you are eating. We spent our first afternoon and evening under the palapa on the beach. The service was exceptional. The resort provides ipods and staff periodically brings, cold towels, bottled water, and frozen fruit to keep you refreshed out in the sun. We did not feel like getting dressed for dinner our first night, so I asked Manuel, the bartender (very friendly and makes a great \"Mexican lemon drop\") to bring us menus to eat on the lounge chairs. Instead he brought us a table, chairs, white linen cloth and tiki torches for an extremely romantic dinner on the beach. The crab cake and chocolate lava cake were excellent. Overall the food was very good and reasonably priced (our dinners for two ranged between 100 and 200 dollars). The turn down service every evening was great. The canopy nets are dropped, towels are folded in shapes of animals and left on the bed with rose petals. I do recommend bringing some clips for the mosquito netting just in case a mosquito gets in the room so that it is not buzzing in your ear all night. Every morning, complementary coffee, croissants and jelly were delivered to our terrace. A very nice touch. Every Friday the resort has a \"barbeque\" on the beach. I highly recommend it. The menu consisted of soup, scallops, shrimp, fish, steak, chicken and lamb and was all you can eat. The atmosphere was very picturesque. There are two good snorkling reefs 10 minues by boat either direction from the resort. I booked a trip with one of the locals, Mike, who owned the bar next door to the resort and had a great time. Overall, the resort was a great place to relax and decompress, service was exceptional and with the 30% discount we received off the room rates, it was a good value.", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cHeaven on Earth\u201d", "Author": "ca9496", "ReviewID": "UR32463438", "Content": "By far both my husband and I felt that this was the most amazing hotel that we have ever stayed at.

One of our favorite things about the resort is the fact that there is not the typical fight for covered lounge chairs at the beach or by the pool.

However, a few small things niggled during our stay. The cabanas themselves were the best part of the stay - very cleverly designed, so it felt like you were the only ones in the middle of a rainforest, with beautiful private plunge pools and relaxing hammocks. The rooms are enormous. But, the 'rainforest' showers out the back of our room weren't very relaxing as they were situated next to very loud generators. Staff were for the most part, great. There were a few mix-ups over certain things, and requests that had to be submitted multiple times, including incorrect billing at check-out which took a few weeks to resolve. But these things were all dealt with satisfactorily. The beach in front is well tended and the grounds are beautifuly set out - with relaxing hanging beds and amazing sun loungers under cover on the beach. Some other guests had a problem with wading out over the rocks to get to the sandy bottom, but I didn't have an issue with that. Beach-side service was brilliant, there was nothing better than a cocktail in hand shortly after lunch. (Nearly) complimentary yoga every morning was a nice bonus too. The Tides occupies a tiny narrow (but long, leading back from the beach) strip of land, which is effectively only reached now by driving through the carpark of a new adjacent resort. Which looks (as we say in Britain) like a little piece of the Costa del Sol, complete with sardine packed sun loungers. Not quite the neighbours they would have hoped for... thankfully it was near complete when we were there, but I shudder to think how noisy it will be once it is occupied. The hotel next door turned the stereo up loud one day, and it completely changed the vibe of the Tides. The spa was nice, and our massages were quite acceptable. We had a shaman ceremony which was good too. We also enjoyed the restaurant, and thought the bartender mixed the best mojitos ever. I thought the value was ok.

We were greeted by Luis and provided early check-in and six days later granted late check-out and wished a good trip by the entire staff. Everything in-between added to the perfect resort and vacation. In response to the previous reviews, I\u2019d like to state the following: The Tides is the perfect place for a romantic and relaxing getaway. Anyone looking for anything else (or single) should look elsewhere. For romance and a hideaway from the real world it is perfect. There wasn\u2019t really any socializing among the couples at The Tides, but everyone was very pleasant and we exchanged small talk with three couples throughout the week. The service was superb. Everyone at The Tides knows your name and basically jumps out of the way when you pass. They couldn\u2019t have been more accommodating or pleasant. In New York, 15% is the bare minimum we would tip for service, so we had no problems with this. In most cases, we added additional gratuities (for meals and spa services). Our room was kept immaculate and each night the turn down service was beautifully done. Our villa was kept stocked with plush clean towels, bottles of water, rose petals, fresh soaps, linen robes, etc. Anything you called and asked for was brought in a matter of minutes. The staff was continually checking in on us to make sure we had everything we wanted, no matter where we were sitting/laying/eating. The food is amazing. Everything was fresh and delicious. You could basically order any item at any time of day and they would make it for you. I am sad to think I will never have guac and salsa as fresh as I did (everyday) last week. Waking up to coffee and croissants in our villa every morning was also a real treat. In the end, we ate on the patio of our villa two nights (in our robes), at La Marea two nights and in town (Playa) one night. Staying at the resort far surpassed the food in town and we were very happy once we returned. The spa and services were very good. We had two couples massages and the room was beautifully done up with candles (each appointment was in the evening). My first masseuse was fine, but the second (with Aldo) was great. My boyfriend had the same women both times who he really liked. The only letdown here was that they keep male and females separate so we couldn\u2019t relax together after our treatments. In the end, our villa was only 15 steps away, so it didn\u2019t really matter. Our package included 30% off spa treatments, so this brought the total price of each deep tissue massage to $120 when including tax (10%)and tip (15%). Certain things were expensive. The food and drinks were not cheap. However, I don\u2019t know any four star resorts that are. Since the food was so good and service so pleasant, we did not mind the prices, Of course, we anticipated the costs prior to booking. One thing that I was disappointed in was the price for pick up from the airport, which ran about $125 USD. For our return, we called a taxi and were taken for $50 USD (quite a difference). As was pointed out below, the \u2018entrance\u2019 to the resort was strange and had I not read reviews prior, I may have been concerned. There was no construction nor problems with bugs during our stay. The villas are dark, and if I were able to change anything, it would be for them to allow more sunlight on the patio of the villas as well as adding more lights in the room. When comparing the Luxury to Royal Villas, they are definitely not worth the price difference. We never used the outdoor shower, it looked a little too jungle-like for me. All in all, we loved it.

I decided not to write a review immediately as give myself time to settle my thoughts on the hotel. A year has gone by now and the main thought that comes to mind of my experience at the hotel is the feeling of being constantly ripped-off. First the Positives: The reception and room staff were very friendly. The Rooms were beautiful and well kept. The hotel as a whole is very nice and quiet as we managed to avoid rooms near the building site behind the hotel. Beach furniture was also very comfortable. Now the Negatives: I should have be prepared for what was to come as the already steep room prices then had a 15% service charge added to the displayed rate. (what service is there in a room rate?!) Then were the standard restaurant/bar prices which were ridiculously high. A Beer or soft drink for around $10 each!! and again +15% service charge. We had the barbeque on the beach the day we arrived and paid around $250 for dinner for 2 (+15%!!) for some cold fish/meat. Admittedly surroundings were very nice, but hardly worth these prices. The extreme ridiculous moment was when I asked for extra milk with my coffee at breakfast and was charged MXP 85 (+15%) for a glass of milk. They even add service charge for a massage. A Massage IS a service!! I know that being European, we're not so used to paying this sort of level of service charges. However as a frequent traveller to New York, I didn't expect to be paying more for a beer or some nachos on the beach in Mexico than in a 5* hotel in Manhattan. If employees at the hotel actually receive the service charge (which I doubt) they must be amongst the top earners in the country. Conclusion: As a result of this uncomfortable situation, we found ourselves 'escaping' the hotel for all meals etc, which is counter productive as we had paid so much for the accommodation in the first place. I know this may sound absurd to some. I don't mind paying a high price, but I just don't like feeling robbed.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Myers, Florida", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Service Can't Make Up For Drawbacks\u201d", "Author": "InFullBloomUS", "ReviewID": "UR26631953", "Content": "I knew The Tides catered to honeymooners, but I should have thought a lot more about what that would mean. This hotel is really only suited to honeymooners who want to spend their days in absolute togetherness, and even then it's way overpriced if you have to pay the full fare. Very good food and excellent service were much appreciated, but they can't make up for some major drawbacks. Mingling of guests is discouraged by the no-lobby layout, two-by-two beach and pool chair setups, and romantic, candle-lit, isolated dining tables. But I chose The Tides because I wanted a very quiet setting in which to decompress while visiting friends in the area. Given the focus on honeymooners, I expected my \"villa\" (think thatched roof hut with all mod cons) to be very private. Wrong! First, no sun ever seeps through the jungle to light these \"villas,\" so the only sunbathing you're going to do is in public, by the pool or on the beach, and these areas can be quite a hike from you \"villa\" if you're at the top of the property as I was. And the few plants between \"villas\" do not create the expected swimming privacy, let alone protect you from a neighbor's choice of music. Another issue, where privacy is concerned, is that the outdoor \"villa\" showers, although ringed with a fence made of local plant stakes, have enough open space to discourage anyone from using that shower except after dark, when the bugs are biting. With no opening windows and a certain reluctance to leave wide open the doors that form one entire wall (really BIG, heavy doors, some of which have screens, but not mine) while sleeping because absolutely anyone could walk in even by mistake, you're forced to use the A/C when a gentle Caribbean breeze would have been so much better. And then there was the romantic, REALLY dim \"villa\" lighting. No way to read in bed or even by the pool at night. No way to draw/paint (as I do) outside, even during the day, because very little light filters through the canopy, and never inside the \"villa.\" No way to see what you're doing in trying to work the sound/entertainment equipment, day or night, unless you remembered your flashlight. Best light is in the bathroom, which is where you'll end up reading at night if that's your desire -- and even honeymooners occasionally take a reading break. The hotel did provide, upon request, a goose neck reading lamp so that I could sit at my romantic dining table and try to read in the pool of light created by the lamp. And when I spoke up about the lack of privacy around my pool, they built a terrific fence in record time between me and the neighboring \"villa,\" but this didn't help when the cleaning crew came to work on that \"villa\" while I was swimming early one morning. Frankly, I should never have selected this hotel with the expectation of skinny-dipping in my own expensive private pool because their layout just doesn't provide that level of privacy. The hotel does warn you about the access \"road,\" and you should take their warning VERY seriously. It's a non-road for much of the distance, and on the one day it rained hard, it became a flooded non-road. A fortuitous mistake at Hertz left me with a humongomobile, but nothing less than an SUV or truck should attempt this dreadful road. Also fortuitous was finding a terrific little restaurant just outside the hotel's gate, turning left as you face the non-road, that was less than half the prices in the hotel's restaurant. No ambiance, but friendly service and terrific food.

Thatched villas tucked along winding paths in the jungle are a delight and the plunge pools a treat for early morning/late night dips. The water temp. in the pools can be adjusted to suit each guest from the front desk. Most villas are secluded and screened by vegetation but a few of the \"upgraded' ones closer to the beach are less private. The beach is wide and 7 miles long .A coral outcrop directly in front of the resort makes swimming difficult if there is surf but walk 2 minutes to your left for a smooth sandy swimming spot. If you have surf shoes at home ,bring them; if not, they loan surf boots and snorkel gear. The room was large, king size bed was very comfortable with nice linens and pillows and a lovely ambience with high thatched roof, subtle lighting and hidden speakers. Unilike most resort rooms in warm climates with high humidity, this one smelled GREAT. Large doors to patio give light and airflow but no other interior windows open, meaning you must use A/C at night [or sleep in an unlocked room. ] Wireless internet provided. Nice rainshower in bathroom[ no tub] and nicer one outside with lots of privacy. Lighting is subtle and romantic so thanks to tripadvisor reviewer who suggested bringing extra light if you like to read outside on the patio at night. We brought headlamp/ lighted ball cap and some votive candles. Enjoyed incence sticks that were replaced daily. The food at the restaurant was excellent; fresh ingredients, well prepared and interesting presentation. Bravo Chef Mariana! Prices are on par with fine dining in any good restuarant. Great staff. Guests were an even mix of 50-60ish folk and honeymoon couples the week we were there. No night life. We each had 2 treatments at the Spa and recommend the \"Mayan Awakening\" and Holistic Massage\" treatments. Played golf twice at the Mayakoba course, which is great and about 10-15 minutes away; 5 when the road is improved. Insects were not a problem in our location, which was closer to the beach. Women should be aware that there are tiny midges that appear from the sand or ground at sunset in almost all seaside tropical locations that bite your ankles and lower legs. They can only jump an inch or so at a time and if they land on a sock or a man\u2019s hairy leg, they don\u2019t adhere to it. If you are eating on the beach at night, a pair of socks, although not elegant, will prevent you from having itchy ankle bites the next day.

To return the favor, the Tides is my first. As a bonus, I included a small rant on mandatory service charges. In summary, we had a nice stay at the Tides and I wouldn\u2019t discourage anyone from staying.. I simply think the rooms are average and price outside their range. But if there is a deal that puts the rooms in the $500-600/night range, then that\u2019s different story. I know they have several promotions now that might make that possible. Here is how it stacks up in my view (with references towards it two peers --- Maroma & Esencia. Each which we have been to at least once) Staff Grade: A to A+ Reading some of the other recent comments, I suppose it is true that everyone has there own view of the world and two people have utterly different experiences at a same moment & place. I thought the staff was the redeeming quality of this hotel! They are personable, nice and did a great job. They always remember your name and seem genuine in their interest to make the stay pleasant. Things were slow at times (mostly around the dinner rush) but promptness was never an issue. Value for $ Grade: C My biggest issue is the price. Before I read JP3CHICAGO\u2019s review, I had intended to say that if you stay in the Royal Villa (which we did), the extra $200/night it would be the biggest waste of money you will ever spend on vacation lodging. EVER! But maybe it isn\u2019t that bad if the construction noise was as he indicated. I didn\u2019t hear a thing except for mosquitoes (and they are pesky at the Tides due to the setting) and birds. To the point, I think, $900/night just doesn\u2019t cut it. Strip-out the plunge pool (which is a novelty anyways) and the rooms are just average. For $575/night, Esencia\u2019s garden rooms are far better. And you also get the \u201cplunge pool\u201d there. For $1,500, you can stay in the Cottage Rooms at Esencia with 2 stories, 2 bedrooms, a living room and your own theater/media room. PLUS you have a full size pool (the kind you can dive in) and the most beautiful terrace you\u2019ll ever sit around. We stayed there last year and it was wonderful. Roomwise, amongst Tides, Maroma & Esencia (the three un-arguably best SMALL boutique hotels in Cancun)\u2026Esencia wins hands down! Finally, on the rooms, I\u2019m not a big fan of the DENSE Tides jungle setting around the room. The rooms are dark and mosquitoes problematic. But that\u2019s my personal preference. Beach Grade: B The beach is much maligned. Yes there are rocks, but it adds character. The biggest negative is traffic\u2026it is a very well traveled beach. So if you are looking for seclusion, you won\u2019t find it here. Otherwise, it is very nice (the sand, palapas, service). Best beach amongst the three is probably Maroma, followed by Esencia. Food Grade: A to A++ The Chef is awesome and the food is great. Dining \u201canywhere, anytime\u201d is a brilliant idea. The barbecue on the beach\u2026tremendous. What the staff did from Valentines on the beach\u2026awesome. Ambiance: B Adult only boutique hotels like this have boring clientle. I guess that includes me then! Finally, a rant service charges. How did we get to a point where a 15% gratuity is mandatory? It isn\u2019t a convenience for me and frankly I\u2019m tired of it. Let me decide! I really wish people would start pushing-back. I will pay 20% for good service at each and every place I stay\u2026but if it is 15% mandatory, that\u2019s all they\u2019ll get. Maybe this policy of mine isn\u2019t fair to the hard working staff\u2026but that\u2019s the way it goes. Though this is not endemic to the Tides, it did get my \u201cgoat\u201d when I realized I was paying $200/night more for the service associated with the Royal Villa AND a 10% mandatory service charge on the full $900. Isn\u2019t that what the $200 was for? Mandatory service charges need to stop. It has totally malformed (wanted to use another word but Tripadvior censor wouldn't let me) the whole concept of tipping and gratuities.

The resort is all villas, some more private than others. We purchased the Royal villas, which are the same as the Luxury villas but slightly closer to the beach and inclusive of some additional amenities and service. I agree with other reviewers that under no circumstances are these extras worth the cost - book the Luxury villa instead. The villas are beautifully appointed, and the layout is lovely. Tthey are set in the jungle so the rooms are dark. The surrounding plant life is beautiful, but we missed the sun in our room. The lighting is dark in the room, but you can request brighter bulbs in the lights which you should do upon arriving. There are many places to relax and dine on the property, and they all have a beautiful view. From hanging beds with private curtains near the beach, to beach cabanas and poolside tables, everything was beautifully situated. The staff couldn't have been be more gracious and charming, but there was always a 30% chance that our requests would be forgotten. Normally this would be acceptable as a cultural difference, but at these prices, it cut into our enjoyment of our trip. The food was exquisite and wonderfully prepared. The chef is fantastic. We had a cooking lesson with her in the jungle and she was talented and charming. She was very accommodating to my vegetarian diet. The wine list is deep, and if you are a wine lover I would highly recommend exploring the Mexican wines as virtually none are available for export. They are of wonderful quality and their smoky-ness pairs well with the Mexican cuisine. The one culinary disappointment was the inclusive breakfast. A skant, hard, bad croissant with coffee, and sometimes tea. Given the quality of the resort, this felt off brand. Note that both the food and wine are extremely expensive, even by Manhattan standards. You can go into Playa del Carmen if you are feeling the pinch a bit, but the food won't be of the same quality. We found the city to be very Americanized, and not very authentic, so didn't spend much time there. We did scuba. We did a reef dive off of Playa del Carmen that was unremarkable, a cave dive in the Ceynotes that was quite unique and spectacular, and then a reef drift dive off of Cozumel (which required a pleasant ferry ride) that was also very stunning.

The villa was great with a very comfortable bed and an excellent connection to the internet if you brought your laptop. Now for the drawbacks, most of which aren't terribly bad. The inside shower sprayed all over the place and was almost impossible to use but the outside shower was great. Only problem was, the outside shower wasn't lighted so couldn't be used at night. It's very hard for them to get the temperature right in the pool-spa...it's usually either too cool or too hot. There is no way for you, the guest, to regulate it yourself. The food in the restaurant is outrageously expensive even though it was quite good. The first night we spent over 2000 pesos on dinner. However that included two drinks and two glasses of wine. The next night we went to town ($15 dollar cab ride each way) and had a nice dinner and spent much less. The service is excellent and they try very hard to please you.

However, the feeling that they are always trying to take every last peso never quite goes away. The individual palapa-style bungalows are absolutely incredible. Ours had a bamboo walkway through the jungle to our patio and plunge pool. The privacy offered is unlike anything I have ever experienced. We were initially concerned that the jungle would not provide complete shelter from the trails, but once we entered, we forgot all about anyone else. The rooms themselves are stunning and simply decorated. The high thatched roof provides most of the ambiance you could want. We took full advantage of the plunge pool and the outdoor rain shower and could not have been happier. The coffee and rolls that arrive each morning before you wake up and are placed on the outdoor table were a great touch. The common grounds are nearly immaculate and the service was excellent. As others have said, this stretch of beach is rocky, but you can walk 1/4 mile up the beach to a more gentle access. Or, you can case out the best route through the rocks and swim in front of the resort. However, the food and beverage prices are a little out of line. A beer from the minibar cost something like $8 USD and the restaurant and bars were way overpriced for what they serve. I don't mind paying resort prices, but there is a limit. Fortunately, the town of Playa del Carmen is a short taxi ride away (have them call a local taxi) and it is easy to get back to the resort (the driver may still know The Tides as \"Ikal del Mar,\" its previous name). Playa has lots of great bars and restaurants and the whole town has a laid-back but very nice feel. We had the taxi stop at a shop and bought beer and liquor for the beach and the staff had no problem with it. They even brough us ice.

Examples: 1/We needed to finish our vacation a day early, because the economic collapse unfortuantely necessitated my return to work - undoubtedly an understandable situation considering the rare circumstances of the 2008 crash. They told us that despite hotel regulations, \"things will be fine\" with the last night charge. However, the manager that was supposed to authorize it wasn't to be found and did not come back to us for two days. Finally, we got hold of him when we were about to leave for the airport. He insisted we pay for the last night and only after some arguing was willing to cut 50% off the night's charge. 2/ We wanted to visit Maya ruins in the vicinity and were offered a day trip for close to $700(!). In the same breath, one of the staff offered for \"one of his friends\" to show us around for $350 - half the price, and was willing to settle for $250 - imagine what kind of kickback the hotel gets on those poor suckers who go for the full amount! We ended up hiring a taxi driver for a day for $150. That's right - one fifth of the original price. 3/ The hotel's shuttle to the airport costs twice as much as a taxi to the same destination. We therefore arranged for a taxi for our departing flight. However, when the driver arrived to pick us up, hotel staff told him he was mistaken, and that we were to leave the next day - this after twice verifying with us the day before whether we had airport arrangements! Shameful. BTW, the drive to Playa del Carmen using the hotel's driver also costs twice as much as taking a taxi into town. 4/ At the restaurant we were constantly pressured to order more drinks, as the waiters are partially compensated for alcohol sales. Twice we were surprised to find errors in our check related to drinks - charges for drinks that were offered to us on the house, and a charge for drinks we did not order. Other problems: 1/ The hotel beach is filled with rocks - it's dangerous going in and out of the water. Read: unrecommended. The staff openly admits \"there's nothing to see\" in the water. 2/ The hotel is quite un-ecological, what with towels and sheets replaced twice daily - with no option to forego the change (we simply put the \"do not disturb\" sign - a rope that \"closes\" access to the villa - to prevent the change).

We chose the Tides in part because of a 30% discount on the room rate and spa treatments and were glad we did. We stayed for 5 nights in a royal suite. Everything was pretty seamless, from the pickup at the airport to the activities we planned on the spot. We were picked up in a spacious SUV at the airport and taken 45 minutes or so to the Tides. The road leading up to the Tides is a bit odd... there are a few condo sites being built and there is basically no official road to get to the Tides, but don't despair, once you get there everything is great. Despite receiving notices of construction from the hotel, we heard nothing measurable from our villa, 22. The pluses: Great food (though a bit pricey, think New York City prices) but the quality was comparable to high-end New York City restaurants, so I'd say it is worth it... the chef, Cupertino, will customize your meals to your specifications, if desired. Ended up eating there every night. Staff is always available for any need... no searching for someone to help you. If you make a special request, they will honor it... for example, we requested extra water in the room and they remembered every day we were there. Rooms are cleaned twice daily and you never see them in your room....true housekeeping ninjas, similar to Aman Resorts style... Rooms are spacious and fairly luxurious, considering you are in the jungle. Large plunge pools are a great added touch... Beach is nice and uncrowded, no need to wake up early to secure cabanas... Pool is good-sized, given only 30 rooms at the resort Activities are easy to set up... recommend diving off Cozumel with Pepe, great experience. Also, snorkeling in the cenotes... Downsides (admittedly minor) The bill gets large quickly if you are taking advantage of the resort's offerings The beach is rocky at the shoreline, but clears up deeper in. However, water socks are provided free of charge, along with snorkeling equipment. Would be nice to have some rafts or other water \"toys\" plainly available, but to be honest I didn't ask specially for them. Water is nicely colored though.

We spent the second half of our honeymoon at The Tides (we left a highly-rated resort down the beach in Playacar early - too resort-ey and crowded, and the pool scene was trashy), and we promised ourselves every night we spent sipping Pacifico and Modelo Negro by the beach that we'd return for an anniversary or another special occasion. We had the time of our lives. At the main \"lobby\" (outdoor, under a palapa, with candles, and funky arm chairs, and tropical plants, and great magazines scattered about) we were greeted warmly - with icy cold coconuts with the tops chopped off, and a straw stuck inside - so we sipped coconut water while we were given the tour of the property and shown to our villa. Our villa was perfect. #38. The bed was like a cloud. Flower petals and turn down service every night. The bathroom and outdoor shower are unforgettable. Also the hand-made soaps with local ingredients and Molton Brown yummy smelling toiletries. Our villa was tucked away in the jungle, which, contrary to other reviews, we really liked because we had tons of privacy and nobody walking by our path at night. Hey, we had our own pool, and we were on our honeymoon. :) Something I really appreciated is that nothing was disposable. No paper napkins or plastic silverware. The soaps they gave us weren't harmful for the plants around the outdoor shower. They fill the grounds with native plants - they were planting more while we were there - rather than forcing crab grass, geraniums, etc., to grow. It's eco-friendly, but not crunchy. And the spa... ahh, the spa... get yourself at least the relaxation massage. Use those showers. Just incredible services, and a very unique experience. The food was delicious. Expensive, yes, but worth every penny. Especially after we tasted how the other half dines in the \"nicest\" resorts on the Riviera and the tourist traps in Playa del Carmen. No comparison to The Tides. We met the chef at the infamous beach barbeque on Friday night (just do it, you won't regret it), and he was warm, professional, and very interested in our feedback. I'm a vegetarian, and he had customized a four course meal especially for me - soooo good - and he was genuinely interested in my opinions on each course. I'll never forget that meal. The lunches and breakfasts were also fantastic (around $20 - $30 per person), and the service - everyone who works there - is impeccable. You feel like there are four staff members for every guest. They are attentive, but informal and not obtrusive at all. Manuel helped us on the beach, and he made our days lazy and fun and exactly what we dreamed of for our honeymoon. Victor was also funny and warm. Everyone remembered us by name. They wear ear pieces, too, and the lot of them talk back and forth all day... so they are free to roam the property but they can get you answers to your questions immediately. They also let each other know when a guests are en route to a particular space. We felt like they could read our minds all week. I have nothing bad to say. The windy, bumpy road keeps it exclusive and hidden. Even the construction noise (they are building a few more villas, and a condo property is being constructed right next door) was minimal. Some other guests we met mentioned that they were bothered by it one morning and mentioned it, and were accomodated well for having mentioned their complaint. The wine list is expensive, but we enjoyed several bottles of a delicious Mexican cabernet-malbec blend that was under $50 a bottle. We were delighted with it. All in all, this is a honeymoon/anniversary/couples paradise. It is another world. You just unplug and enjoy it. I read four books while I was there, and so did my husband, and we still talked ourselves out. There is nothing to do but enjoy the sun, the water, the space, and the person you came with. One note: this is NOT a family destination. Your kids won't have fun, and the other guests will likely be irritated. I love little guys, but not in a place like this. Or teenagers.

The hanging day beds on the beach front and in the garden(complete with waterfall)are reason enough to go to The Tides. This resort, in my opinion is NOT for any child. I saw some young teens there.

We spent the July 4th weekend here and really enjoyed most of our stay. However, I strongly disagree with the last reviewer who remarked that \"the construction noise is not an issue\". It was a major issue for us, as our villa was at the very back of the property and very close to the condominium construction site. We were awakened at 6:30 a.m. on Saturday by the loud construction noise, and had Julian, the manager, change our villa to a quieter one close to the spa. When you are booking, find out exactly how close your villa will be to the rear of the property, and try to get as far away as possible from it. With that said, the property is gorgeous and the villas are extremely private. It is certainly possible to swim in the ocean although there is a rocky ledge at the surf's edge -- the resort provides rubber \"swim booties\" with thick soles, allowing you to walk over the rocks without hurting your feet. Beyond the initial fifteen feet or so, the water is fine for swimming. On Friday night everyone dined on the beach in the moonlight with torches and sandpit fires burning, and the experience was unforgettable. The food is very good though not great, but we weren't there for the cuisine. This is a quiet couples hideaway kind of place, and it is perfect for that. There were numerous younger honeymoon couples as well as couples in their 40s and 50s who, like us, were having a kid-free getaway. Service was generally excellent and very friendly in a way that made us feel special, while still giving us our privacy. Drinks and meals are quite pricey, so be prepared.

One thing that was consistently stressed and instilled by my employers was, \"the spirit of Aloha\". This spirit was a vividly distinct hospitality and attention to detail that consisted of extending a genuinely warmhearted welcome into the family of local residents and extending yourself in ways that made the guest feel as though their time in Hawaii was spent with friends. My time in Hawaii and my pride in the level of guest service I provided has, however, left me forever critical and acutely aware of others in the same profession. I am delighted to say that that same spirit of Aloha is alive and well in Mexico. Jorge and his staffs' understanding of the service they provided and the manner in which they conducted themselves allowed me to positively and completely relax. I don't want to detract from what I was most impressed with in Jorge and his staff, but I would be remiss in not extending the same awe to Chef Cupertinos artistry. His talent is undeniable, and perhaps not as frequently appreciated. Some of the finest cuisine in all my travels. Lastly, the grounds keeping staff. They maintain just the right combination of indigenous flora and transplanted greenery in a way that I loved. Not too pruned, not too overgrown. You're left in touch with the jungle that transplants you to a time and place removed from the resort monstrosities mere footsteps in the sand away. A beautiful setting on a beautiful beach.

We wanted privacy and romance and that is exactly what we got. The hotel has only 30 villas so we didn't see a lot of people around. We were alone in the pool quite a few times. The pool was spectacular with breathtaking views of the ocean! The service was outstanding. The workers knew our names and were very friendly and attentive. The food was amazing and also expensive. A romantic 5-course dinner on the beach or \"BBQ\" as they called it will cost about $300. A couple of drinks at the pool along with chips and gaucamole will cost around $60. The room was awesome with our own dipping pool and hammock in the front. We also had an encounter with a scorpion but we were surrounded by jungle so it makes sense. The room had a canopy bed and a large bathroom with a giant showerhead and my favorite Molten Brown bath products! The maids kept everything perfect and added sweet touches like flower petals on the bed and sculptures out of towels. The ride from Cancun airport was a little long though and when we started driving down the street to the hotel, I thought to myself this looks like a scene from the movie, \"Proof of Life\". Have your seat belt on because you will drive on the bumpiest dirt road ever surrounded on both sides by jungle and construction. I thought this cannot be right....but it was and once we arrived at the hotel I understood why the road was that way. It prevents a lot of people from going there which is a good thing. Overall, our vacation was awesome and I can't wait to return to Playa Del Carmen.

The same holds true for The Tides. If you are a frequenter of SLH hotels, Four's, Mandarin's etc. you expect 5 star service, food, accom. for 5 star prices. Its close, but isn't a Gold Lister yet. The positive's: Beautiful grounds. All that you read about it is true for the layout, and you do feel like you've found your own paradise within the jungle. Pool and beach area are clean, infinity pool and pool area sexy, well manicured, and peaceful. Its the Mexican Riviera, so the beach isn't The Nurse's beach in Kaui or Pink Sand beach in the Bahamas....its got some rocky patches, but its the way the beaches are on this stretch, not the hotels fault. Also saw a prior guest say jet skis are everywhere....yes true, but again, you're on a beach at a resort area....can't blame the hotel trying to make money renting jet skis. Rooms are spacious, clean, comfortable King bed, great bathroom- Molton Brown products (although is that really Molton Brown body lotion or just the bottle). Killer outdoor shower, the plunge pool is a great touch and the outdoor set up is spacious and comfortable. Also about as private as I've seen. We all know whats going on with outdoor showers and pluge pools and I've seen rooms with one on top of another with some screen seperating one pool from another. Not the case at the Tides....nice set up. Food is as advertised. Best I had in Playa...great chef. Food can be real iffy at most beach resorts I've been to, but not here. The Negs you've read in other reviews: First off I didn't book the luxury room w/a private butler. I would recommend doing this and paying the extra $ 150-200 a night if you want 5 star service. A number of times I had to call and ask 2-3x for water, to have my plunge pool temp turned up, on the jets to be turned on. Room Service took forever. You do hear the construction, it does start early, but its really not that bad. You do get a sewer smell...My bungalow was close to it, but again, its not that bad. You're in the jungle so there's bugs, duh! Had little lizards running all over the place and they make it in the room sometimes and had a flying beetle or cochroach fly into the mosquito net, but you have to expect that. I scuba dive and had a personal guide. I paid for it, but the extra $50-$100 I spent gave me a personal cenote dive and the aquatic guide is knowledgable. He will customize your activities. As with anything that is private or customized you have to pay and that should be no surprise to you. Meals are expensive, for Mexico way high, but the food is great, and for this type of resort, not uncommon. The one thing I would correct if I was management is trying to upsell guests on water, and tequila. You order 2 bottles of water and a shot of tequila they had you taste test and before you know it you just dropped $150. That's just crazy and a gouge job. I didn't appreciate that at all. They also all went to the United Airlines Premiere school of service. Yes, yes, yes, anything anytime...but ask for something a little out of the ordinary and its not today, or its not operating today...etc. They really do try and I'm just nitpicking for those of us who really appreciate the little touches and true 5-star service. If you're looking for a romantic getaway--relaxation, seclusion, with a lot of luxuries and a unique jungle type location, I recommend The Tides.

Needless to say, Julian's promise was fulfilled and The Tides gave us one of the most memorable vacations we have ever had. Their personal attention to each and every guest's needs are second to none. It all began with Luis our butler. Luis made sure that everything we needed from dinner reservations, to spa treatments, to adventures around Mexico, to special menu requests were taken care of for us and did so with a smile. Then there was Victor, our adopted butler. (Or as Luis would say - the PR department.) Victor was always on hand to ask how we were doing , remind us to put on lotion or simply to chat for a few minutes. Manuel at the Tequila bar knew our names by the first day and was quick with our favorite drink or a bottle of water all week long, before we could even ask him for it. One of the Nicest and most peaceful person we met was Vanessa the Spa Director. She personalized services to fit our needs and taught us Yoga every morning; allowing us to start the day with a clear mind, open heart and a smile. And, of course, there was Pepe and Santiago our personal tour guides. They showed us Tulum with colorful stories of people long gone and took us snorkeling in the cenotes. Not to spoil it but the trip with them is worth it just to get their special lunch. The Tides Riviera Maya is a Beautiful place not only for the location but more importantly for the people you meet.

We wanted to have a romantic getaway and we were particularly looking for a small and very serene resort. After reading many excellent reviews about this hotel we booked a week-long trip. I was a bit nervous because this resort sounded too good to be true and I was very pleased to discover that it was all that and more! The Tides was perfect for what we were looking for \u2013 an adults-only romantic peaceful experience with excellent service and unbelievable food. We felt as though we were the only ones in the whole resort. Many things contributed to that feeling \u2013 the expansive grounds of the hotel, most of which is a jungle. The private villas were superb and we were able to be completely nude without anyone seeing us. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful in every way. We felt like they were all at our service every minute of the day. So we really felt pampered. The private villas are beautiful \u2013 clean, nicely decorated, and incredibly romantic. I definitely wouldn\u2019t suggest this place for anything other than romance. Every night we had a turn-down service. We\u2019d come to our room from dinner and the canopy drapes were down, flower pedals everywhere, a page of love poem on the bed, and a very sensual music playing in the background. The beach was very comfortable and really beautiful. We didn\u2019t go into the water because the beach is definitely rocky and the water was a bit rough most of the time. The pool is very nice though and even though I\u2019m not a pool lover I enjoyed it very much. The food was amazing although very expensive \u2013 think $300 for dinner (including a bottle of wine). The dinner menu changed every day and so did the theme and the setting. One night we had an Argentinean BBQ with a bong fire, another a very romantic pool-side candle-lit dinner, another on the second floor of their open-air restaurant overlooking the pool and the beach. We went to Play del Carmen for a day once but didn\u2019t really like it. I though it was kind of trashy and loud with tons of street vendors everywhere selling junk so we couldn\u2019t wait to get back to our nice hotel! Now there was one big negative. I don\u2019t know if we were unlucky (because no one else complained about that) but we had a few incidents with local jungle creatures. Seemed like all of them wanted to hang out in our room! There were multiple cockroaches and ants (both couldn\u2019t get very far in due to the bug poison that the hotel sprays I guess, so they die as soon as they enter your room). One night we had a scorpion in our bathroom which we had to kill with a garbage can because the thing was huge. Another night we got a visit from an enormous caterpillar, also in our bathroom. So the hotel had to send a \u201cteam\u201d almost every day to get rid of the \u201cbodies\u201d. I guess it\u2019s smth to be expected when you\u2019re living in the jungle but it was very unpleasant to see those creatures in our room.", "Date": "June 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "lauraloo23", "Title": "\u201cIf you can afford it...nothing can be better\u201d", "Author": "lauraloo23", "ReviewID": "UR16797186", "Content": "We stayed at Ikal Del Mar for our honeymoon...yes, it is very expensive.

Our room was one of those furthest away and this was still a real nuisance. WE WERE OUTRAGED THAT THE HOTEL HAD NOT WARNED US OF THIS, especially given that this seems to be a condo complex built by the hotel.

Our benchmark is the Fourseason Hotels standard. We were traveling in October 2007, so due to the weather in Mexico we went to Cancun to be more save. We did know a bit about the hotel, as different friends of ours went to the hotel, but before it was taken over by the Tides. We did think that a new owner would even make it better. But we were so wrong! Before I start, we did live in NY and are now in London, so we are use to high prices, but being in Mexico \u2026 you do not expect higher prices than London. And on all you book (trips \u2026 diving, land visit etc. the hotel takes a 20% service charge). That was such an expensive trip, that going to the Maldives in August last year was much cheaper. But fine if you are willing to pay it you are at the right place. We new the room price, but were very surprised by the food and drinks. Ok, let\u2019s first start with the good part \u2026 expensive, but the restaurant and the cook are super. The cook did learn his business in San Francisco and mixed a bit Mexican with French kitchen. Very often he came out and asked everyone if you are happy or if he can surprise you with something else. It was really yummy ! So, sadly that was all the good part. Let\u2019s start with the bad information for you: 1. There is a big construction side next to the hotel and it does not bother the hotel as it is going to be their big new Residence style apartments. It was a not very nice arriving as you drive a bit thru that before coming to the reception. 2. Our first room was next/behind a wall to the construction and it was very noisy. Knowing that the hotel was just 40% (they told us before) booked, you do ask yourself why they give you that room and not start with the once far away from it. I was very unhappy when they did not want to change it in the first place and was told that I can turn on the whirlpool to hear it less. I got very angry by that and went nuts at the reception. 2 hours !!! later they did show me around a couple of other rooms and I did pick one, but still I was very sad that every room is so dark and still you can hear from all of them the digger from the construction. 3. New room, we settled in and went for a quick cocktail to the beach. We did \u2013thanks god- put all our belongings in the save, but left some pocked money in my handbag. When we came back we surprised someone going thru our stuff, we could not see the face but saw the uniform. All the money was gone and our clothes and other stuff up side down. I did not feel save anymore. The hotel mentioned that sadly that was not the first time and they are working on it. With the uniform they knew the department of it but could not find out who it was. We got invited that night for dinner and wine, much more than went missing from our room, but I have to say they could not change my feeling about the safety for the coming week. 4. Due to the jungle style that hotel is build, first view very nice but you do have 24/7 mosquitos around. You have them in the room (no matter what you try to keep them out), during the day on the terrace as it is very dark without sunlight and it is very bad in the evening. Bring spray with you \u2026 and you have to put it on 24/7. I was still bitten all over the body and looked very stupid in my bikini. 5. The pool was not clean. I asked them to clean it and they removed the leaves out of it, but you still had everywhere moss in and around it.

To be more specific, the hotel staff (significant in size in the context of a 30-room hotel) makes an effort to accommodate any desire you may have--they will set up a dinner table for you ANYWHERE on the property, and little surprises when we returned to our room (champagne, flowers, desserts, tequila tastings) made us feel special. They get to know you by name in a non-invasive way, and learn precisely what kind of drink you would like by your second day at the pool. The answer to any question is never \"no,\" and if there is a request that cannot be satisfied, you are left convinced that it is certainly not for lack of trying. The spa is serene and unique in design. The poolside has a fantastic ambience with a direct view onto a nice stretch of beach.

If we were forced to level criticism, it might be that while the breakfast and lunch menu were good, the dinner menu lacked a little in excitement, and we found ourselves wanting to try something new after a couple of nights (this despite the fact that there is truly no more romantic place to dine anywhere than the seafront setting at the hotel). Additionally, the ocean directly in front of the hotel is a bit rocky and therefore does not invite you to swim, well-mitigated by the pleasant pool area with the ocean view that seemed to satiate our desires for the ocean experience. Moreover, while the beach directly in front of the hotel is very nice, we were not motivated to take beach strolls because of the less appetizing developments down the beach on either side (fortunately, not close enough to interfere with the serenity of the hotel's beachfront experience). The location of the hotel is an easy 30 minutes south of cancun airport. And with the exception of a wonderful day in Tulum for a change of scenery or Chichen Itza, there is really no reason to leave the tranquility of the hotel....which is a good thing considering the fact that Playa del Carmen (touted by some as \"European\" or \"quaint\") is a veritable lower-middle-class cesspool of low-end retail, characteristically \"cheesy\" and touristy bars, restaurants, etc, and seems to have very few redeeming qualities. In other words, avoid it. In summary, the Tides is certainly worth the money, has a truly superior level of service that promises not to disappoint, a unique seaside setting, and is generally the kind of place you would not want to leave. The spa services are \"good\", and we feel we had precisely the vacation that we deserved. Do not come here if you plan on casually meandering through a quaint Mexican town if you want or need a 'break\" from the hotel's seaside (unless, of course, you are prepared to drive an hour to Tulum or perhaps take a day to see Chichen Itza). As a final recap, the hotel is luxurious without being pretentious, cool without being uncomfortable, serene and extremely service oriented. It seemed to cater just as well to people in their 30s as to those in their 60s, and cultivated a sort of serene \"coolness\" not intimidating to those of any age, and not passe or tired to Manhattanites who have \"been there and done that.\" The crowd was diverse, and everyone seemed to converge on wanting the same type of holiday---a quiet, sunny place to get away and be pampered for a little while.", "Date": "February 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago area", "Title": "\u201cA perfect 10!\u201d", "Author": "hfplaurie", "ReviewID": "UR13644894", "Content": "My husband and I planned to stay at the Tides Riviera Maya for 5 nights in early December 2007 for a well-needed romantic getaway. We left the day after a foot of snow in Chicago and arrived in paradise by mid afternoon. It was so wonderful that we ended up extending our trip another 2 days and really could have stayed even longer. We didn't want to leave because we were so relaxed and pampered! Everything from the rooms, the service, the food, the spa, and the grounds was perfect! The rooms are absolutely beautiful. The beds were so comfortable I didn't want to get up in the morning. I loved the private jungle surrounding and waking up with the sounds of the birds outside, our coffee waiting on the patio, (and yes, occasional banging from the construction). The private pool and outside shower were real treats not to mention the unique turndown service at night, the handmade soap, and the great CD player (we brought our own CD's). The grounds themselves are exquisite too -- the pool, the dining area, all the little private nooks and crannies, and the spa. Since we are totally beach people, we hung out on the beautiful beach beds everyday and spent a lot of time in the water. I highly recommend bringing water shoes or, if not, they have some there to use as there are rocks in the water. We also had a couples massage at the spa and although it was not the best massage I ever had, the setting is beautiful and it was very relaxing. The service was wonderful too. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and jump the minute you move your little finger. There is nothing they will not try to do. By the end of our trip, we knew most of the staff and had a lot of fun joking around with them. Sometimes things moved a little slowly, but it is Mexico after all and sometimes I think it was a communication problem due to my bad Spanish. Jorge, the front desk manager, was particularly helpful so when I needed something, I usually just went to him. Now to the food... Chef Cupertino is a great chef with impeccable credentials, and a nice, young guy too. (Apparently The Tides recruited him and most of the kitchen staff from Las Ventanas). The food is outstanding but yes, it is expensive. Same with the drinks. I think it goes with the territory. If you're worried about being nickeled and dimed, then this is probably not the place for you. Just assume you're going to spend at least $1,000 night and enjoy it. We did go into Playa del Carmen one night for dinner (La Casa del Agua) and the meal was about 1/2 the price but about 1/2 as good. So the rest of the nights we stayed at The Tides. We did a couple excursions too while we were there. We went snorkeling one morning (it was average). Another day we did a combination trip to Tulum with snorkeling in a cenote (a freshwater cave). I highly recommend that. We went with Santiago (Pepe's partner) both times who was just the nicest guy ever. We also played golf at Mayakoba (very expensive) but my husband loved it. It's unfortunate that the construction will take away some of the ambience of the drive in (it must have been spectacular when it was all jungle). But unfortunately, there's building everywhere now. Also, a couple very small, minor suggestions: 1) Bring your own alarm clock. The wake up calls tend to run late. 2) The amenities in the bathroom are great (Molton Brown) but they don't supply shower caps. Since it's a rainshower head, the water comes straight down. If you don't want to wash your hair 3X day, bring your own shower cap. Overall, it was a perfect vacation in paradise! We have travelled extensively and generally stay at high end hotels and resorts. The Tides, however, was by far one of our favorite places EVER and I would definitely love to return again (which I don't say about a lot of places only because there are so many places in the world to go).

We stayed Sunday night through Thursday and did not hear anything except the sounds of the jungle and the sea. Maybe the KOR management response is accurate. We arrived via the Tides Range Rover from Hotel Basico in Playa Del Carmen. That review can be found there. We were greeted as we stepped out with a moist cloth and chilled fresh coconut milk with a straw in the coconut. Very cool! Our personal butler took us on a brief tour of the resort and spa, then treated us to mojitos before taking us to our villa. The villa was spectacular. Very private and romantic. The outdoor shower seemed to have an unlimited supply of hot water. The personal pool was also heated to a nice temp. If I had to, I think I could live there! The beach and pool were incredible. My wife and I have traveled to many beaches around the world, and this is as good as any. The lounge chairs are spaced out nicely, and you never had to \"save\" a lounger at any time of the day. Don't even think about moving the lounge chair yourself...the attendant will jump right on it. They even would greet us with an ice cold water bottle after a walk on the beach. They were always one step ahead of us, anticipating our every move. I am still not sure how all the employees seemed to know us by name even though we had not been introduced before. The bar staff were very attentive without being a pest. The chef, Cupertino Ortiz, made sure my wife had her nightly Caprese salad with fresh Buffalo Mozzarella. The menu changed mid-week, and your dining options are plentiful. You can dine where you want when you want. The will literally put a table for you wherever you tell them you want it. The restaurant (upper deck) was a nice option on the one windy night. The whole atmosphere and ambiance was begging for some nice \"chill\" music. That would be our only complaint. What little there was, did not seem to fit the whole scene. If you are familiar with Nikki Beach...this is very much like that...just not with the right music. Jorge, the front desk manager, would check on us daily to make sure we were not lacking anything. Francisco would make sure the \"others\" would not wander in off the beach, and Jacob and Manual, made sure we had whatever we needed while on the beach or by the pool. The housekeepers also added their personal touches to our bed and linens each nite. Wireless internet throughout the property was really important to us, so we could keep in touch with our boys at home. There were also lots of little touches and small details that we noticed throughout the property that told us that this property wants to leave a lasting impression.

The Tides has a lot going for it, but also has a ways to go. In brief: The dreaded construction is, in fact, a problem, as others have stated. Which villa you get is of paramount importance. And despite specifically requesting a villa away from the noise at the reservation stage, and having been assured that that would be possible, the unctuous butler/greeter guy tried, upon our arrival, to stick us in one of the villas closest to the construction. When we protested, he claimed the resort was 100 percent full. When we continued to protest, and drew his attention to the assurances that had been placed in our reservation file, he switched us, despite his initial claim that that would not be possible. In short, if they show you to one of the villas right near the construction (near the front entrance, in particular), you need to push back immediately. One gets the sense that they try to pawn those off on the unwary or timid. So stand up for yourself, both when you make the reservation and when you arrive. Not that you should have to, but there it is. That dispensed with, the place itself is extraordinarily nice. The grounds are gorgeous, the villas are comfortable and phenomenally romantic. Really, really nice, and, as others have said, exactly like the pictures on the website. So have no fear there. The service, with the exception of the quasi-management-level guys, we found to be excellent. Very friendly and quite efficient given its context. No complaint there. The food, we thought, was excellent, though expensive. The drinks, however, bordered on a scam--plain and simple. It's one thing to be expensive. It's quite another to be offensive. They'd make more money (an all-too-ill-concealed aim, at times) if they'd charge a still exorbitant but marginally more palatable 10 bucks for a margarita, say, than 15. I mean, as soon as you get the first drink bill, you basically go into a state of lockdown, which serves neither vacationer nor hotelier very well. The water shenanigans have been well and accurately documented by others so I won't go into that. The pool is very nice, and the beach too. The coral is a very minor issue, in my view, and I wouldn't let that scare you off. These midlevel guys who appear to run the place are kind of disastrous, though. After the hassles with checkin detailed above, all of which resulted in us not occupying our room until about 8 o'clock on the night of our arrival, one of these guys has the temerity to suggest that we'd need to vacate our room early(!) on the day of departure. Again, we pushed back and the ostensibly impossible became magically possible. But what a drag. A guest should never be made to feel that they're imposing--especially not at what after all is said and done amounts to well over a thousand bucks a day. Bottom line: This will be a great\u2014I mean truly great, world-class\u2014resort once the construction gets solved, the mid-level managers get a good talking to, and they figure out how to run an expensive resort with the class and tact that that kind of property demands. I, like many folks I think, will happily pay a very high room rate for the right product, but tend to blanch at what might be argued to be comparatively minor expenses, like 8-dollar sodas and 15-dollar margaritas. Why? It's symbolic. It screams \"you're being taken advantage of\"\u2014it's a constant reminder of the expense of the vacation, and it can't help but call the intentions of the entire enterprise into question. It leads a guest to begin examining the value proposition of every aspect of the resort. And that's not something you want your guests to be doing. And, as a guest, it's not conducive to a relaxing vacation. I really liked this place. A lot.

First while it may seem nice to have someone always at your beck and call, that also means that someone is always watching you and requesting to make solid plans for you. The staff really did not like spur of the moment activities and were not friendly when you changed your plans, as is likely on a relaxing vacation. Second, the food is good but GROSSLY overpriced. You could not have dinner for less than $100 per person. While the food was indeed good and the chef, Cupertino, very friendly and receptive to guest needs, the prices were ridiculous. And on top of the menu prices there was 25% extra added for service and taxes...and then they asked for tip.....Also relating to food bills, make sure to check your bill when you check out as our villa received many erronous charges which belonged to other guests. Very unprofessional. Dinners in town in Calle 5 are superbe and affordable, therefore I recommend that option highly. Third, there is no fresh water. The showers and taps in the entire hotel are brackish water (ie salty). Thus you never feel really clean when you shower. Fourth, it is difficult to get into the ocean because the first 30 feet of water have a coral shards on the bottom so it is challenging to walk. Additionally there is a lot of floating debris in the water (mostly red algae) which makes swimming less than ideal. Fifth, the road approaching the hotel is in horrible disrepair. Unpaved with large pot holes and dramatic drops make the journey to and from the hotel risky...Especially when in a cab instead of the hotel's SUVs. That being said, there were a lot of nice aspects of this hotel. Each room has its own private pool and hammock which is great. The recliners on the beach and in the pool area are very nice. The jungle around the paths is beautiful and full of animal life. And the staff are definitely looking out for you...flip flops in the rooms, water delivered on the beach, and free wireless. However for the caliber of the hotel, the negative aspects listed above were surprising and I wish I knew what I was getting into before I got there....which is why I am writing this review.

They have nailed superior service. What really impressed me was the genuiness of the staff--they treat you like a long lost friend and not merely a customer. BRAVO! Two comments worth noting that negatively affected our stay: First: I expected high menu prices, but at times we felt gouged. For example, the water on this property is not drinkable and complimentary bottles of water are provided in the rooms. However, when dining at the restaurant, you are charged $3.50 for the same bottled water if you want any water with your meal. Seemingly insignificant, the sort of thing stings a little when already paying premium prices for a hotel--especially when the water is non-potable. The food was pretty good but on the overly priced side. Second: Adjacent to the property a MAJOR condominium construction project is underway. The work started at 6:45 AM and lasted until after 7:00 PM EVERYDAY INCLUDING THE WEEKEND. This is not an occasional hammering or sawing--this is MAJOR pounding and significant noise that echoes throughout the entire property including at times the pool and restaurant areas. The noise is less noticeable by the pool and beach, but still can be heard in the background. There was no escaping the noise from 7 AM to 7 PM even in our room with the doors closed and air-conditioning running. While this is not the hotel's fault, I do wish that I had known in advance as I would have elected to not stay at The Tides this go around and would have tried it in the future instead.

I suggest sending future vouchers to those guests who have had to endure this painful noise in this gorgeous paradise. Overall, the staff is amazing and the property incredible. I'm disappointed by not being informed of the construction noise, and therefore can only rate my stay as average and not excellent.

I was nervous about getting sick from the food, but it never happened eating in the resort and outside in Playa Del Carmen. The only issue (but it is a big one) is the construction which is next door. They are building a massive condominium complex which is basically right next to the property line of the resort. Unfortunately, the workers start working at 7AM and finish for the day at 6:30-7:00. If you are not an early riser, the noise will wake you. Also, the spa is right near the property line so it also gets a lot of noise from the construction which is a shame since I wouldn't recommend the beautiful outside massage rooms since you will hear noise during the day. The amount you hear will vary from day to day. This all being said, once the construction is complete, I would 100% return. It is hard to imagine a nicer, more beautiful place to stay.

The resort is surrounded by a 10 foot wall that is barely noticeable, but most of the rooms back up to the wall. Our room was about 10 feet from the wall with the construction just 5 feet on the other side. The construction is from sun up to sun down (7am to 5 pm) everyday except Sunday. We were awakened by pounding hammers and yelling workers every morning. I am not exaggerating when I say several times it sounded like our bathroom was being remodeled. We tried to not let it ruin the experience. If you do go, request a room near the water, below number 20, which will help a little. Also, the spa is right next to the construction. The spa is wonderfu,l but the message room is an open patio covered with a mosquito net. The construction is about 25 feet away.

The food is good, but quite expensive. I agree dinner is not too bad, most entres around 25-30 dollars and bottles of wine around 50 dollars and up which I would expect for a nice restaurant. However, lunch and drinks around the pool are a joke! Our lunches were over a hundred dollars everyday.

I would recommend going into town a few night to experience 5th ave as well.

We were originally planning to drive down to Mahahual for the weekend after our stay in Tulum, but once we arrived in Mahaual we realized that it was not where we wanted to be for our vacation. The town might have been very nice if not for the hurricane damage from Dean in August. We were looking for a rustic adventure but this was a bit too much. So we turned around and drove three hours back to Tulum. Once in Tulum we were exhausted and needed some pampering so we called The Tides at 6:30p on Friday to see if they had any available villas for that night and the weekend. By some miracle they did. A certain couple had checked out an hour previous due to some emergency. We were at The Tides an hour later and could not have been more relieved to have real showers, fine dining and a soft bad. Not that we didn't love Tulum, but The Tides is a nice change of pace after 4 days without electricity. Once the initial relief wore off, however, we quickly realized that The Tides was ludicrously overpriced. It's a very pretty resort, the villas are wonderful (especially the beds) and the beach is fantastic. But is it worth over $700 per night? No way. For that price we could stay at most any of The Four Seasons. The real problems are in the food and the service. The food is decent but actually doesn't compare to cheap Mexican restaurants in Playa del Carmen and Tulum. There are also too many waiters and servers there who seemed inexperienced and inadequate. We actually ended up eating most meals in town or at other resorts because $250 for average food and service is insane. Upon our arrival our villa butler told us that there is complimentary tea / coffee and pastries that would be brought to our villa in the morning. He asked what we would like and at what time? We asked him for tea and bread at 8a. The next morning I had to call the front desk at 8:30a and ask where my breakfast was. It showed up about 10 minutes later but it was coffee and not tea. So I had to call again and ask for tea to be sent over. Also, on our last morning I asked for a 7a wake up call which did not come until 7:30a. I had a busy agenda on that day and was late for everything thanks to that wake up call. How can you be late with a wake up call? Take a page from Motel 6 and set them automatically. It's little service things like this that make a big difference to me especially when I am paying thousands of dollars. Another big problem is the Spa. Not worth it at all. We have been to many spas up and down the Mayan cost and across the world and this was one of the dullest luxury spas I have ever encountered. The spa facilities are nothing worth note. No one offered me anything to drink at the Spa. The changing areas are co-ed and the massage rooms are dull. My therapist never introduced herself, never asked me what kind of pressure I like, never asked me if it was ok as it was going along, and kept breaking the rhythm of the massage. It was a very bland and shallow deep tissue massage for $130. Another strange little moment was when we got back one night after dinner and a lovely box of chocolates was laid out for us on the bed for turn down service. This seemed great until we got our bill and found out that a $15 box of chocolates was charged to our bill from the mini bar. Strange turn down practice. The construction is also a problem. We were there on a weekend so the noise was only a nuisance on Friday night and Monday day, but the entire resort is surrounded by construction right now and it's a really unattractive sight just outside the hotel walls. I realize that some of these complaints may seem trivial and there are some parts of the resort (the beach, the pool, the bed, the outdoor shower) that are wonderful. But all things considered I cannot recommend this resort for the price. If price is no object and you rarely think about these little things...then you should not hesitate to go to The Tides. The Mayan Riviera is amazing! There is so much to do - beach, food, tequila, ancient ruins, scuba, etc, etc - and the mexican people are super friendly. Be sure to visit the beaches of Tulum and please don't eat at any restaurants that serve shark.

We even used bottled water to brush our teeth at night instead of drinking the water (even though they claim it's ok here). We weren't taking any chances. Then this happens. Unreal.

The Villas are all beautiful, some are more private than others, in fact my husband and I felt ours wasn't quite as private as we would have liked, but we asked to switch and the second night we were moved to a more private villa, it was actually a bit of an upgrade that they gave us. The Outdoor showers are an incredible experience, I don't want to say all of the little surprises that are included in a stay, but there are many that make it extra special. The food is pricey, It was good food, but not exceptional. By the time our stay was over I was ready to come back to new york and eat the food here. I just didn't think the quality of food deserved the prices it was, however, the bbq on the beach is a MUST DO!!! its every friday night, they have live music for it and its just a beautiful and romantic evening. The service was incredible, the people found out that my husband liked to fish and within minutes were there with some fishing poles they had purchased for us to use. Every morning as we would finish breakfast they would come over and approah us about fishing that day, they would set up the poles take theme away, we really didn't have to lift a finger while we were there. The resort never really feels busy and we found all of the guests to be delightful. people were all just warm, it really felt like we were living in a mayan community for a week.

My husband and I arrived and were treated excellent from the staff from the moment we arrived. Everything that other's have written about the bugs is pretty much true. The only problem I had was with the mosquitoes. Bring bug spray. I left and my ankles had tons of bites on them. It was mostly my fault though because I didn't use bug spray as often as I should have. Just remember that bugs live in the jungle and that's where you will be. The food was great. My husband and I wanted to have more casual food when we were by the pool. Steak and lobster wasn't what we wanted for lunch. They totally accommodated us and made us something that wasn't on the menu. The scallops, shrimp and steak were excellent. Some of the best that I've had. One recommendation is to bring movies if you know that you like to watch TV. We didn't bring any and some nights all we wanted to do was stay in and watch TV. We ended up watching Kramer vs. Kramer and As Good As it Gets. Those were the best picks of the movies. One other warning is to be careful if you decide to go horseback riding. We had a horseback ride included in our package. The man that takes you is very sweet but he doesn't speak any English. I've been on horses before and took lessons when I was younger so I'm not completely uncoordinated on a horse. We went out on the beach and my horse was eating grass one minute and then started into a full sprint the next minute. I ended up falling off as the horse was running. The owner was very apologetic but I will never get on a horse again. So, if you decide to go, make sure he has you tied to his horse so that your horse can't run off. The massages were great. My husband and I did the couples one and it was very special. It\u2019s in the same room and they do a blessing at the end. The massage oil that they used smelled great! Another nice thing was that you never had to carry cash with you. It was nice to be able to leave without worrying about money and paying for things.

Some villas are more secluded than others. Ours was very secluded and we were quite pleased with the experience. The outdoor shower was nice, but we didn't get a lot of use out of it. The indoor shower with its oversized rain shower head was really nice. I would love to have one of these at home. The private plunge pool was very nice and we used it every day, rain or shine. Relaxing in the hammock or one the over sized chaise was a regular daily diversion. Bring some reading material and movies if your so inclined. Their selection of movies is at best odd. Additionally, and not to be ignored. You are in the jungle. There are going to be bugs, lizzards and other wild life around your pool and in your villa if you leave the door open. On succesive evenings we had a frog, a tennis ball sized hermit crab and a small lizard in our pool. If this is a turn off to you, I would reccomend a room at the Ritz in Cancun. The Tides provided us with bug spray and a citronella candle by our pool. If you like the scent of their aroma therapy candles and incense, ask for more oil, votivs and incense, they will bring it promptly. Make sure you follow up on any special requests you made on your pre-stay questionnaire. Rides into Playa del Carmen in the resorts Range Rover or other luxury SUVs are $20 + tax & service charge, while a cab back is only going to be $10 + tip. You will want to plan on a couple of evenings in town, we found the menu at the Tides restaurant to be a bit limited eat 3 meals a day there for a 7 night stay, but what they served was well executed. In particular we liked the breakfast selections. We consider ourselves foodies and would probably give the restaurant between 4 and 4.5 out of 5 stars. Dining on the beach ($200 + consumption) was really nice, we got there early and watched the cruise ships depart from Cozumel which is about 15 km away and easily visible on a clear day. I would also highly recommend stopping on your way from the airport to the resort to get some snacks, beer, soda, juice, etc. The in room mini bar is highly over priced. Although we used the mini fridge for juice and water that we picked up in PdC. I found the liquor selections to approximately 2-3 times the going rate in Playa del Carmen. Water and juice about two times what you pay at home. There are a number of tequila store in PdC which will allow you to sample their tequila's. They will also have smaller sample sized bottles for sale. I would highly recommend Amate Anejo, over ice. A stop at the duty free before your flight down might be a good idea too for some champagne or liquor, other than tequila. 1/2 bottles of White Star were $60 on the mini bar. Victor had a 1/2 bottle of White Star waiting for us when we got there. I am not sure if that was because we were honeymooning or what. Service is highly attentive, but unobtrusive. If there is some urgent service and you have the 'rope' up at your villa, which tells the staff you do not want to be disturbed, they will call from the front desk to ask if you want your evening turn down service or if you want your luggage delivered (United lost ours on the way down). Our butler, Victor, attended to tracking down our lost luggage and saved us from having to be on hold with UAL's pitiful India based customer service. I was grateful to be saved that aggravation. You'll be greeted with a rather nice welcome ceremony. The butlers will recommend various spa services based on your interests, they can set up rounds of golf and recommend restaurants in town. We loved Yaxche's authentic Mayan cuisine and atmosphere. We didn't care for Cafe de Auga so much. The food, service and ambiance was nice, but we were really looking for more localized cuisine, so the butlers were one for two on restaurant recommendations. Most designer shopping was disappointing. We found a lot of things to be more expensive there, than at home. Your better off in the duty free zone in Cancun. PdC has ample night life. If your looking for $30 all you can drink beer bashes, Mr Frog's is down where the ferry leaves for Cozumel. There are other smaller, places which will satisfy your need for a bumpin time. There is also a nice selection of quieter lounges along Avenida 5. The staff is generally cordial, but you'll find Cancun to be more outwardly friendly and welcoming. Be careful when you book, the rainy season begins in mid-May and extends through the summer. If your looking for a round of golf, I would highly recommend El Chameleon at Mayakoba ($200), the course is amazing, unique and is quite frankly the experience you would expect from the Fairmont. Its also only about 15 minutes from The Tides. Maykoba was very buggy, make sure to bring the bug spray from your room. A cab ride will run about $12. Playacar is much further away, and I am told that it is a tighter more challenging course. Should you be looking for cigars, the ONLY place I would suggest buying, to avoid counterfeits or poor quality cigars is in the middle of Avenida 5 in PdC. Its the only place with a revolving door into its humidor and they keep their humidor extremely cool. Any place else and your risking getting stuck with fakes or beetle infested cigars. I was in a number (There are at least a dozen) of PdC cigar shops. Unfortunately, I cannot recall the name or address, but look for the revolving door into the chilly humidor. Anyone who is soliciting you to buy Cohiba's should be avoided. Cohiba does not make any glass/plastic topped 5 packs or boxes. The Tides tour of Tulem and Xel-Ha is exceptional. I don't know what else to say. Our guide was very friendly, knowledgeable and showed us a great time. The private car is a nice touch. Conversely, I cannot recommend any tour with Brandt Entertainment. They only take payment by Paypal, and getting our money back from them has been difficult. We originally scheduled a tour with them through Cancun Discounts and they stood us up. They even left us the slip of paper which said that they left before the end of departure window which was in my confirmation. Stick with someone who takes Visa/MC/Amex. Thankfully, the Tides was able to set something up on very short notice, and it was amazing. Once again, Oscar made our stay exceptional. If you do the snuba tour @ Xel-Ha, save some pictures on your underwater camera for the end when your guide feeds the fish and they swarm around you. I cannot recommend the snorkel tour. Getting into the boat from the end of The Tides pier is dicey at best in calm conditions. I wouldn't try it again. Although once on the boat Kiki was friendly and took us to a nice bit reef.

If you have looked at the room rates and you are not concerned, this is the place for you.

Your staff member waits close enough to see to any need yet far enough that he does not intrude. Cupertina (spelling?) is the head chef and will see to anything you want. We had him cook for us on two nights and enjoyed both meals. Tell him what you like and what you don't and then let him do his magic. He is fantastic. The staff is incredible. Carlos was our favorite waiter. He seemed to know exactly what we wanted or needed even before we knew it. On our last night, he came (in the rain) to say goodbye. Our package included snorkeling. We chose to scuba dive instead. The price of the snorkeling was subtracted from the scuba. Pepe' was an incredible dive master and knew the reef very well. After watching some local fishermen we asked if we could fish from the pier. The front office informed us that they did not have the equipment on hand but would locate some. Within 30 minutes or less, small silver cases were brought to us. Inside were new poles and tackle. A bucket of fresh water and ice was brought to us. Whatever we caught would be prepared for lunch later that day. Amazing service. This momentt of fun was of no additional cost to us...just another way the staff treats you. Chips with fresh salsa/guac and the chicken quesidillas are a must. We ordered them to be brought to our room. We set them by the side of the private plunge pool...kiss, swim, kiss, eat, but not necessarily in that order. The rooms are beautiful. The netting around the bed is romantic but is there for good reason. Each night the netting is loosened, flowers adorn the bed, and the lights are dimmed. Each morning the netting is tied and new flowers adorn the bed. Fresh fruit is delivered daily along with the morning pastries and the days news. Rooms are safe and secure. Do not be afraid of the high, open ceilings. They are not open to the outside. You will hear many sounds of lizards and birds (you are in a jungle) but they will not come in. There is glass behind the shutters. We only bring this up because the first night we slept with some lights on. The next morning we discovered how secure we really were. While some may not enjoy \"nature\" we did not mind. Use the bug spray and the candles, and you will be fine. We were a little surprised at the lizard population but did not mind them. It only added to the exotic feel. On our last night, Ana from the front desk told us not to have dessert at dinner. We came back from dinner and to our surprise...trails of flower petals were strewn across the floor, in the center of our bed was a heart made from flower petals, two vases filled with the most beautful lillies were placed on either side of the bed, the lights were dimmed, chocolate strawberries lay on a plate, and a handmade note with burned edges, tied with grass, told us goodbye and wished us many more years of happiness.

The biggest surprise is we didn't expect it as our standards are pretty high (we compare most resorts to our benchmarks of the Hotel Bel Air in Beverly Hills, Montage in Laguna Beach, private villas in Anguilla, Four Seasons in Milan). The staff during our stay was phenomenal - our 'butler' Luis was excellent - he made every effort to ensure our stay was memorable. He provided a pre-loaded music/video Ipod, special eyeglasses to watch movies on the Ipod, CD's, fresh flowers, fruit and cheeses over the course of our stay. He also helped us with dinner reservations, excursions to the ruins of Tulum and the cenotes. He always made a point of asking 'what else may I do for you?'. What really impressed us is how he and other staff took care of friends of ours who visited our property (they were staying at another hotel in Playacar). They prepared a beautiful table for 4 by the pool with extra candles, flower arrangements, etc. The chef (new from Las Ventanas in Cabo) prepared a 5 course tasting menu with wine pairings that was incredible. When we finished dinner (around midnight) they had the Tides Suburban running and waiting to take them back to their hotel and gave them each a small gift before they departed. The only drawbacks to the property, if you consider them drawbacks, are the villas do not have views of the ocean - but we knew that going into it and you'd probably pay $800+/nite if they did. And yes, there is some noise from the other villas' AC units. You pretty much need to close up your villa at night and put on your own AC unit, whereas we would normally leave all the windows open. We did sleep extremely well every night however so we really can't complain. When we did arrive they put us in a villa very far from the beach when I had specifically asked for the opposite. When I did ask for another one closer to the beach they obliged and were very apologetic. Our villa was very private but walking around the property you could definitely see through the foliage into other's villas and pool areas. The food is expensive, the appetizers priced about 2 bucks more than they should be, the entrees maybe overpriced by $3 but it's one of those things where if you are concerned by this or it's breaking the budget, you may be at the wrong level of resort. I have no idea how much the drinks were, we never asked, but have a feeling we agreed to ordering some very expensive tequila(based on Carlos - our waiter's suggestion) that added to the $1200 dinner bill for that night with our friends. So just go, relax, enjoy the sun, beaches, the friendly staff, food and wine, Playa del Carmen, and by the end of the week you won't want to leave either.", "Date": "May 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cPrivate Luxury Oasis in the Sun\u201d", "Author": "StrappySandals", "ReviewID": "UR7342225", "Content": "My boyfriend and I are pretty seasoned travellers. We decided to take a break from the city and go down to the Yucatan for a week last September. We both love traveling and checking out new restaurant, hotels, etc. So, we planned a 9 day holiday and stayed at 3 hotels - Zamas, Casa del Agua, and Ikal del Mar. We left Ikal for the end - saving the best for last - and we weren't disappointed. There are about 30 palapas and they're all very private - trust me! The property is very well manicured, with quality linens and Molten Brown toiletries. Although, they can be a bit stingy with their toiletries. I packed away some lotion into my bag to carry with me while we travelled around and the maid saw it and put it back on the counter, rather than giving me a new one. That was a bit annoying when you're paying $600/nt (because it was low season). You can probably get away with not having any currency with you because they can bill practically everything to your room. While we were there, we didn't even have to tell them the name of our room because they remembered - so the service was quite attentive. You start off w/ getting a tour of the property, including the lovely spa (which we tried and really enjoyed). I got lost once or twice amongst the winding sidewalks and tiki torches, but it was alway more of a fun adventure than anything else...especially, when you accidently end up at someone else's palapa and have to turn around to find yours! Every morning, they leave out coffee/tea/pastries on your outdoor table. The only problem was if they don't cover it properly, you end up with ants in your breakfast! We ended up only being able to drink the tea for the couple of nights that were there. The pastries looked delicious though! You also must try their pina coladas. My boyfriend doesn't really like Pina Coladas (contrary to ME!!), but he couldn't get enough of Ikal's. So, all in all, I would definitely recommend a stay at Ikal.

It was everything we wanted and expected, and more. You can read other reviews for information regarding the spectacular setting and amenities, but I want to focus on why there are a few negative reviews amongst the majority of positive ones. Ikal is a sublime paradise for a certain kind of traveler, but it is not for everyone. You are paying for a particulat mind-set and ambiance, not \"things\" that can be measure in monitary terms. The goal at Ikal is to create a serene and tranquil atmosphere where no reminders of the busy outside world exist, a goal they acheve extremely well. (even every day items like brooms and trays are wrapped in canvas bags when carried through the property by staff, ask for matches and they will be presented wrapped in a banana leaf to cover the printed images) Having been in the hospitality industry all my life I was very impressed by the staff. Without exception each staff member in genuinely warm and sincerley focussed on meeting and exceeding each guest's individual wishes and desires. When considering Ikal keep the following in mind: Ikal tries very hard to preserve the natural beauty of the region and to keep alive the sites sounds of the natural enviroment and ancient Mayan culture that have existed there for countless centuries. You are in the jungle, there are bugs. They are not numerous and they certainly won't bother all but the most sqeemish visitors. Yes, they end up in your pool and one or two might even wander into your room. For me this is a plus, I know I am in a tropical paradise. If you want a sterile enviroment without a few mosquitos then Ikal is not for you. Of course you also have to give up the many species of butterflies and tropical birds that fill the air, the geckos and and lizards that are darting about. There are no signs, no printed words or numbers to help you find your bungalow amongst the winding jungle paths, and paracticaly no where else on the property either. Again, this is very intentional and forces you to slow down, way down, and become a part of your surroundings. For us, we loved finding our way back along the paths at night (lit by hundreds of candles and torches) by remembering to \"take the left past the waterfall and look for the banana tree, then go right where the path splits around a huge flowering vine\" Yes, you will occasionally get it wrong and wander into another bungalow area and have to turn around and go back. If this sounds charming, as it was for us, then Ikal is your kind of place, If it sounds irritating, skip Ikal. Nothing happens quickly, again, very intentional. If waiting a few minutes for a drink or your entree means bad service to you, go somewhere else. I would rather be served at a relaxed pace by someone who sincerely loves his or her job and genuinely wants to please, even though they may not be familiar with every wine on the list or every ingredient in the the dozen or so different (and wonderful!) ceviches that are offered. The world is full of great restaurants with polished servers that know more, serve faster, and also regard you as source of income rather than a respected guest in their home, as is the case at Ikal. We found Ikal very private. Yes, you can hear other guests at times, the bungalows are fairly close, but there is thick jungle between each that creates a visual screen. The outdoor showers are wonderfull, and although you can see out to the paths quite easily, it is almost impossible for anyone to see in. (at first we thought we were exposed, but I went out to the path to see if I could look in and found that everything was obscured that should be) If you are modest than use your indoor marble shower instead. If you can't put away the cell phone for the whole trip, do yourself and all the other guests a favor and stay somewhere else. staying connected with the outside world undermines the whole purpose of the resort. Our only negative experience for the whole trip was hearing a cell phone ring at dinner, and then watching the guest look irritated for having to go to the far side of the dining room to take the call. I don't know what they were talking about, but I assume they were complaing to another type \"A\" personality that breakfast was 10 minutes late and that their double half-caf soy latte had to much foam and not enough peruvian nutmeg. Guests are asked not to use cellphones anywhere on the property. The beach is rocky and getting in and out of the water is difficult right in front of your beach palapa, just walk a couple of hundred feet to a nice sandy entrance point to the north. I snorkaled every day (equipment complimentry of Ikal) and was amazed at 10 pound Parrot fish, huge schools of Jack and large live coral reefs in 6 feet of water directly in front of the property! If you want to be immersed in an enviroment that is not like home, if you have respect and interest in the Mayan and Mexican cultures, if you enjoy the contrast of opulent comfort amidst rustic and natural beauty, and if you like service from real individuals with genuine smiles, then Ikal will be a treat of a lifetime.

We booked our trip after reading many reviews of Ikal, both positive and negative, on this forum. We had hoped the negatives were exaggerated, but unfortunately they were not. The rooms and grounds are beautiful and the staff is friendly, however privacy is an illusion, service is at best merely competent and the food only average to good. Ikal does not provide the level of service that should be a given for the price they charge and we won\u2019t be returning. In more detail.... The Good Villas are spacious and well maintained/cleaned. Bed linens are luxurious and the bed is very comfortable. Towels are plentiful. Bathrobes, sandals and Moulton and Brown bath amenities are provided. The fridge is stocked with 2 Cokes, 2 Diet Cokes, 2 fruit juices, 2 beers and several bottles of water. Having a plunge pool is a treat. The grounds are lovely, pool area is beautiful. There are ample lounges (both sunny and shaded) by the beach and pool. A generous supply of towels and straw hats are provided. Iced face cloths are passed out at regular intervals. Staff is available to take meal/beverage orders and bottled water is available The staff is pleasant and courteous. A few of the staff tried hard to make our stay memorable - Eduardo (the head butler), Manuel (our waiter on several occasions), and Israel (the bringer-of-cold-towels-on-the-beach) stand out. When we had an undercooked burger for lunch, the waiter not only comped the lunch, but also insisted on giving us a complementary cocktail at lunch the following day Some wonderful butterflies, moths, and lizards abound on the property. The Bad The villas have no screens, AC must be used at night (to escape insects and the heat) but the AC has a strong mildew odor. There is insufficient light in the room or on the patio to read at night. They do provide a small gooseneck desk lamp, but there was nowhere to place it for two to use. The plunge pool does get dirty quickly with fallen leaves and dead insects. They clean it once a day, but if you return to the room before they have cleaned it, they won\u2019t intrude. Contrary to other posts, they do not ask about your preferred pool temperature, they turn the heater and pumps on and off at prescribed times. The room/pool/outside shower are not really private. Depending on the villa location they can be seen at the very least by immediate neighbors and staff. Those along the main path can be seen by anyone walking by. You can also hear your neighbors. Despite the travel agent telling them of our anniversary twice, and our subsequent mention of it on the guest questionnaire, there was no acknowledgement by word or deed by anyone at the property Contrary to other posts, they did not ask if/when we wanted the continental breakfast delivered. We did specify a time to our guide on the afternoon we arrived. The first morning our 8:00 breakfast arrived at 9:45, but only after two phones calls to ask where it was. All subsequent mornings it was delivered 45 minutes later than requested. Meal quality varied from good to average, but no better. On Valentine's Day there was a prix fixe menu - our waiter didn't know that there were four courses, or that the dessert included champagne. When the restaurant manager was making final rounds and asked us how things were, we told him they were not good - he acknowledged that he knew of our \"case\" (missing a course, missing the champagne), and we also told him there was lobster shell/cartilage in our soup. He apologized, and offered excuses, but nothing else. At $120/person for a meal, we expected better execution and a better response from the head of the dining room. Mosquitoes - Ikal did provide repellant, but we still got munched on \u2013 over 29 bites for one of us in two days. Tey no longer offer a shuttle into Playa del Carmen in the afternoon. You need to take a cab instead. They happily got us a cab, but never mentioned that they charged our room (nor did we sign anything), so we paid TWICE, once to the driver and once to the hotel. On the second trip in, we signed a voucher and knew we were being charged, so we only tipped the driver. Ikal also double-charged us for a second trip into Playa, but corrected it once we pointed it out. No request made to the front desk by phone was ever handled correctly. It required at least two calls or a visit in person (missing bathrobes, missing glassware, breakfast not delivered). When we were there, the pier into the ocean was closed, so getting in and out of the water required either a pair of reef-walkers or careful stepping.", "Date": "February 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "brooklyn, ny", "Title": "\u201cwe admit it, we were impressed\u201d", "Author": "jodiandron", "ReviewID": "UR6819623", "Content": "Ikal was a big splurge for us, and we initially wavered a bit on our decision to stay there, especially once we read some of the critical reviews posted here in recent months. But these two picky New Yorkers were mostly impressed (and relaxed, and pampered, and rejuvenated). This place has its act together: it's gorgeous and incredibly well run, eager to please and yet laid back and on a par with the best places we've ever stayed (Four Seasons resorts in Asia etc). The casitas are stunning, the communal pool area is gorgeous, the shaded palapas on the beach are very comfy (though the beach is a bit rocky and not worth exploring -- there are some more sandy parts a few hundred feet to the left, but there's nothing much to see in either direction beyond that other than trash and all-inclusive resorts so don't bother exploring), the bed sheets are the most heavenly we've ever felt, the included breakfast is sensational, and there are a lot of little extras-- gifts of morning coffee and pastries delivered to your room, wine or champagne each day, cheese, fruit etc-- from the (newly installed) butler staff. They definitely go the extra mile to please: one morning, my husband was craving churros, and by lunch the chef had whipped up a fresh batch to order, complete with dark chocolate dipping sauce. A few tiny cons: get GOOD directions before you go. The ones on the web site are utterly useless (for starters, the street they tell you to turn on from the main highway has no sign and certainly isn't marked as the web directions say it is), which is inexcusable. If you call, they'll tell you it's on an unpaved road but won't tell you that the road from the highway starts off as paved. Turn onto an unpaved road from the highway and you could end up in a dump, as we did, with giant holes in the road that could swallow a car. Also, there are are no \"do not disturb\" signs on the paths leading to your room (why don't they do this?), and staff comes and goes several times a day. Keep this in mind if you want to swim naked in your plunge pool (and ask for a more private room a few days beffore you arrive -- some are indeed visible from the guest footpaths around the property, and because we made this request ahead of time we didn't have this problem). The food is good but resorty (in other words, far more expensive and less exciting than the authentic stuff at la floresta and la carboneria in playa). The drive to Playa del Carmen, once traffice and parking is taken into account, can hit 25-30 minutes each way, but it's worth it. Rent a car rather than dealing with cabs, and if you get pulled over for speeding, a $20 bribe is all you need (we overpaid). Also, lunch can be a bit slow to come, though the ceviche is excellent (as it should be for $20 an order). Order from your beach chair and then move to the dining area in half an hour (or more) when it will (finally) be ready.

I held my longings for Ikal for the year, and for our 10 year anniversary this year, my husband and I decided to splurge and visit Ikal del Mar. We could only book 2 nights, and that was tragic, but we decided that 2 nights was better than none. We arrived after a horrid experience at an all-inclusive in an unusually cold Cabo San Lucas, and were greeted warmly with cups of coconut milk and cool towels to refresh ourselves from our long day of flying.

We were led to our villa and I almost cried with relief to see how private and beautiful it was! This is the first resort to have a Cal King bed (a big deal to us at 6'1\" and 6'10\", respectively). The bed was surrounded by a gauze tent, the bathroom was beautiful and luxurious, though no tub--but the warm plunge pool made up for that. Our luggage was delivered, and we were then given a tour of the grounds; the restaurant was open air and had a place for lounging for drinks on the ground floor, with the dining above, giving nice views of the pool and ocean. The pool was lovely and glowing, and the grounds immaculate. They had a crew replacing the roof on the pavillion by the pool all night that first night, but they were finished after that and we never heard from them again. I was fun to watch while eating our delicious dinner. I highly recommend the Big Mistake for dessert. All of the food was great, but the Big Mistake was my favorite.

In short this is a great place, but in our opinion, severly let down by the onsite management The hotel is beautiful and in a wonderful location, however it is on a coast which was severely damaged during the hurricanes last year. There is considerable rebuilding work in progress on adjacent sites, with huge lorries using the roads nearby. This could all be heard from our villa when the building sites started working early in the morning. The villas are all very close to each other and although they are advertised as being secluded and private, you can see from one to the other and you can hear your neighbours quite clearly. Whilst it could be considered part of the charm of the place, there are no numbers or names to the villas, and they are all identical, however with no sign posts on the pathways, it is very confusing trying to find your way around especially after dark. Guests don\u2019t sign for anything during their stay, and while this may seem a great idea, it is impractical and concerning for guests as they have no way of keeping track as to what is being spent on a day to day basis, or indeed if the correct charges are being posted to the account. All the prices are shown in Mexican pesos, exclude 15% service and 10% taxes which is then added. When we were presented with our final bill it was all in US dollars. The hotel convert from Pesos to Dollars, however they use their exchange rate, not the tourist rates. In essence the hotel profit on the currency exchange on all accounts. As they account to the guests in Dollars they should quote all prices in Dollars Our account is then converted to British pounds. This is not fair to the guests. Considering the level of the service charge and that it is compulsory, the service in the hotel is very hit and miss, waiters constantly forgetting what has been ordered, or who has ordered it. For example a taxi which we had ordered to go out for dinner in Playa Del Carmen didn\u2019t turn up because the receptionist had forgotten to book it. On New Years Day only 3 members of the waiting staff turned up in the restaurant for breakfast and it took us 1.5 hours to be served with a plate of fruit, two boiled eggs and toast. The tables were not set; we had to ask for napkins, salt and pepper, knives etc. No sign of management either! We felt quite sorry for the staff, they are all extremely willing but are just not trained properly, particularly at a hotel which is not cheap to stay at, advertises itself as having a superior standard of service.

We are avid travelers, having visited some of the nicest & most luxurious spots in the world. About twice a year we try to find a quiet, top-quality location within direct flying distance from NYC for a quick, relaxing, romatic escape. For comparision purposes, previous trips of this type have taken us to The Ocean Club in the Bahamas (great) and the Ritz in St.Thomas (not-so-great). We booked Ikal because we were looking for a place that offered quiet (no kids), privacy, top-rate service, high-quality rooms and a beautiful pool & beach setting. Ikal almost met our expectations, but has fallen short in some key areas. First off, and most disappointing, was the construction at the pool/beach area. Construction started at 8am and didn't conclude until 11pm at night. Considering the open-air restaurant overlooks the pool, you couldn't escape the LOUD noise of machinery, hammering and workers shouting. Had we known of this, we would have changed our dates, but this work was never mentioned to us when we booked with the hotel (it's supposed to be finished by Christmas). The second biggest disappointment was the restaurant/food. While we read other reviewers' neutral comments on the food and didn't expect to find quality like that of NY or SF, we were still very disappointed. Dishes were really hit-or-miss. We found ourselves ordering our courses based on what we thought they couldn't possible mess up versus what we would like. The food, was, unfortunately, that inconsistent. Given this is the only restaurant (unless you take a long, expensive taxi to town), it puts a great damper on the overall experience of Ikal. The service and people, however, were incredible. Best service ever. Rooms: As previous reviewers mentioned, the rooms are gorgeous. They are large, private and comfortable. Being in the middle of a jungle was a nice change of pace. There was a small price to be paid: bugs. There were always bugs in the room (mostly confined to the bathroom).

For that target, Ikal has got it nailed. Great bathrooms, beds, linens, solicitious service and decent food (especially breakfast) for the area. If you are looking for something unique and naturalistic, then I would send you elsewhere. The only thing deluxe about Ikal del Mar are the interiors of the rooms themselves. And even in that respect they are not unique or particularly inventive. The resort is sited adjacent to other developments and is very little in the way of \"beach front\" property. it's a long property with bungalows set back into the jungle. the bungalows are set close together and in some, you can hear the nonstop whirring of ACs, pool pumps, and the restaurant. (again, affluent suburbanites will feel right at home!) Our bungalow was no more than 6 feet from another bungalow. The spa is gimmicky and setup between the bungalows and the resort's reception area (almost as an up-sell...like the drinks at dinner). Tulum is far prettier than the area around Ikal. If you really want to experience the beauty of the area, head there and stay in the nicest bungalow you can. Heck, you can rent 4 for the price of an Ikal room.

Well, last week we spent 5 nights at the resort and it was exquisite, The night before we left, I almost didn't want to leave because I had built this resort up so much in my mind that I was afraid it wouldn't meet my expectations. Well, I should not have worried - it was all that and more. Without a doubt, the most beautiful place we have ever stayed. The pictures just don't do it justice...you could stare all day and not take in all of the resort's beauty. I highly recommend it...but here are some pointers before you leave: - Our package included transportation to and from the airport. When you clear customs, you will walk through the door and be approached by what appears to be airport personnel wanting to help you. They are actually people who want to sell you tours. Just walk straight down the hallway to oustide where you will find a slew of people with signs for tourists. Ikal will be there too. We were picked up in a sedan (Dodge Intrepid, I think), which was fine, but if want to impress your Honey with a little more pizzaz, you may want to contact Ikal before your vacation. -The service at this resort was amazing. You see the same men every day (and they are all men) for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and beach and bar service and they get to know your likes and dislikes rather well. They were all so friendly and attentive and every need was taken care of. Truly top notch. -The beach and pool areas are beautiful. The beach is cleaned every day from seaweed and raked a few times a day. Yes, there are rocks in the water which makes it a little challenging to get into the water, but there is a small break that you can walk through to get to a wide area of sand. Do not let this bother you, it is no big deal. About every hour, icy cold washcloths are handed out to guests and they feel so refreshing. Oh, and the chairs. The chairs have thick mattresses on them and then are covered with terrycloth so that you don't have to worry about beach towels. I never want to lay out any other way. -The restaurant is open-air and has a wide variety of entrees. The food is excellent and well presented. For dessert, try the Big Mistake, which is actually no mistake at all when you're on vacation. It is a chocolate souffle - delicious. When the weather is nice, the tables will be set up around the pool area for more intimate dining. Also, at least one night, dine on the beach - the table is set up so beautifully and it is a night to remember. -The villas are beautiful and the beds are so comfortable! A full night's sleep every evening. I'm sure you have viewed the pictures, but again they do not do it justice. We found our villa to be very private but I could see where some people may complain about privacy. Remember to bring some CD's with you to listen to in your villa. There is a DVD player and the front office has a library of DVD's to choose from. -We had a couples' hot stone massage in the spa and it was very relaxing. They have a men's and women's side of the spa each with a hot tub and steam room. My husband and I took advantage of these before our massage in the couples room, but we could not do the steam room and hot tub together - however, this may the only alone time you have for your entire stay. -One last hint: please try to think of everything you may need before you leave. Ikal is a small resort without a store, and depending on the time of day, it may be hard to purchase items. My husband was sick one night, and thankfully the front office had some medicine because we forgot to bring some. We went to this resort to lay on the beach and do nothing for a few days. However, if you want to be busy, Ikal will set up any tour you would like. If you are bored, it's your own fault.

The suites are private, contained within their own element - offering both peace and seclusion from the world around you. The elegance of the rooms are moving and enhance the surroundings. Having your own little plunge pool is...well...kinda cool. The service is outstandingly attentive, friendly and responsive. The staff get to know you if you allow them and the relationship just grows and grows. The pools, spa and beach are great, of course - what you would expect from this establishment - but the pool... ah....the pool... You will find Ikal an ideal intimate getaway for adults. This is a place to retreat from life's business and allows you to settle back into yourself easily. Maroma is spread out much more, and you can both see and hear your neighbors. The grounds are lush and elegant and very colorful - and extremely manicured - almost too manicured really. The rooms are nice - but not elegant, and have more of a hotel feel rather than a unique atmosphere. We did like the view of the beach from our balcony. The service here was oustanding as well, but the staff did not seem to be as friendly nor as willing to get to know you. The pools are several and very nice. The beach is wonderful - so if you are looking strictly for the beach experience - this is the place to go. The spa is a step above Ikal in presence, and price, but the experience is unforgettable - you will want to spend a lot of money there. In summary, we are going back to neither next year because my wife is dragging me to Caneel Bay at St. John's, or somewhere down there. Sadly. But the NEXT year - oh YES - the NEXT year - it is back to Ikal for 14 days. I liked Maroma - but I did not feel at home there.

You need 2 hours for Chichen Itza, so it's possible in one day (and more economical with time and money). Saw a couple horse riding which they loved. Some suggestions for the resort would be to have specials at the restaurant, as although it was a varied menu, we were through our best choices after 3 visits. Also it was relatively expensive for the quality with a couple of dishes. It's true that the beach is a disappointment as you can't swim, but it looks absolutely beautiful from the resort.

Starting with positives: The villas are gorgeous, the outdoor showers are amazing. Bed and bedding are out of this world. Little breakfast did a good job getting us out of bed. Coffee is fantastic! The pools, both private and public are absolutely chlorine-free, and very warm. We saw birds drinking and bathing in the shallow end of the pool. The grounds are lush, but small. The service is overall very good, especially in the restaurants. The waiters speak excellent english, and their culinary vocabulary is outstanding. Breakfast food was average, however, if you ask to customize your breakfast, they will gladly do so. We asked for more pastries, cookies, salads. Everything was delivered in a heartbeat, except for cookies. When I asked for some cookies, they actually baked them just for me at no extra charge. The lunch and dinner are both very good. I highly recommend having some Don Julio tequila. It is tastier than some world-famous cognacs, is rated #1 among Mexican tequila connoisseurs, and is only sold in Mexico. Mexican wine Calixia is also very good. In the spa, I would highly recommend the Temazcal \u2013 ancient Mexican steam-room ceremony. It is performed by a shaman and is a lot of fun (that is if you can stand the heat) Now the negatives: There is not much to do at the resort. Once you have enjoyed the private villa, the pool, and the ocean, it gets a bit boring. My husband and I are both moderately active, so we walked on the beach (both ways), and I have to tell you \u2013 it is better to die of boredom in Ikal, that to venture out. The beach is not developed, and in certain places very dirty. The hotel beach is not good for swimming \u2013 it is a rocky beach, slippery and dangerous when the waves are high. There is a small sandy beach a little further away from the hotel, where the sand is soft. The only negative is \u2013 even though a short walk away, it is not guarded by hotel staff, so you will have to leave your stuff at your own risk. Think twice before taking those Chanel sunglasses and leaving them on the beach while taking a swim. Additionally, there is no shade, so after the swim you would have to walk back to the resort, to use the palapas. Hotel grounds are beautiful, with lush greenery and gorgeous butterflies. However, there is no stepping off the beaten path, if you venture out, you will crash someone\u2019s villa, as they are well-hidden among the greenery, but are actually almost one on top of the other. Villas privacy is a relative term. One evening, while taking a shower outside, I have noticed a noisy neighbor peeking through the window of his villa, as his windows were overlooking our shower. We could see the private pool area of the villa next door through our bathroom window as well. As mentioned in one of other reviews, noise can also be a problem, giving the close proximity. Spa services are overpriced given the quality. The massages are ok; don\u2019t bother with the couples of the hammock massage. They think that Swedish massage is a relaxation massage. The hot tub is cold, and the outdoor shower is a better pressure shower than the one at the spa. Now the summary: As I said before, we have stayed in Ikal for our honeymoon. We had an amazing time \u201choneymooning\u201d, and Ikal was excellent for the purpose ;) . We will not stay there again, as we like to explore and like more active vacation style.

It is a well run operation. The staff is top notch. The villas are beautifully appointed. However, considering their rates, I think, there are better values in Mexico\u2013\u2013and I'm not a penny pincher. I've stayed at a number of luxury, boutique hotels all over Mexico and Ikal del Mar has to rank up there, for me, as most disappointing. Forget the fact that my digital camera was stolen from my villa and that the spa staff got our massage appointment mixed up. The major disappointments were: dinner, which I would not consider to be gourmet\u2013\u2013the quality of food at dinner was only slightly above average (you'll find better food all over the Yucut\u00e1n); the beach is nice but not particularly secluded (there are more romantic spots in Mexico); the villas\u2013\u2013although screened from one another by the jungle\u2013\u2013are tightly packed together so a noisy neighbor can be a problem; your \"private jacuzzi\" will have to be heated each day (upon request) which takes a few hours. Having said that, the best things about Ikal del Mar are: the ceviche menu (at lunch) is amazing (best octopus I've ever had); the margaritas are excellent (even though they're $14 each); the beds and bedding are exceptionally luxurious; the petite breakfast delivered to your villa each morning is a wonderful way to start the day; the furniture and design of the villas are very tasteful; the in-room stereo system and CD library are nice touches; the staff which is intelligent, helpful and sophisticated. As you can see, my feelings about our time there are mixed. Overall, it's a very, very nice place, but, in my opinion, there are better places in Mexico especially at this price level. I would suggest three alternatives for perspective guests: La Casa que Canta (Zihuatanejo), Majahuitas (Puerto Vallarta), and Casa Natalia (San Jose del Cabo)", "Date": "February 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norfolk UK.", "Title": "\u201cThe downside of Ikal del mar\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4475107", "Content": "The accommodation at Ikal del mar is very attractive but if the weather is the slightest bit cool then the villas are very cold.

The service and friendliness of the people were unbelievable, they all have a knack of making you feel that you are the only guests there. The rooms were spectacular, spotless, nice size, beautiful linen/towels, lovely bathrooms. We used the splash pool every afternoon, it was always clean and yes there were a few bugs in it but we were in the JUNGLE, and a spectacular one at that, I loved the pathways with all the huge trees.

I have been home for 3 weeks now and I still am not the same....I will try to articulate my feelings without rambling too much. First, I have been extremely fortunate and have stayed at the best hotels in world, and nothing has ever come close to Ikal Del Mar. The over all expeience was just amazing. I had planned this trip after many, many hours of searching for the \"perfect\" place. My expectations were set so high that I was afraid that I would be disappointed. Ikal surpassed all expectaions that I had. I didn't even think it was possible. The Villa was unbelievable. Beautiful, private and extremely romantic. You really could stay in your villa all day long and never leave. Once we had our \"tour\" of the property and walked to our room they immediately delivered a bottle of wine and fruit. Then they came and offered us two bars of soap they had just made. Our Villa was beautiful. And the pool was unbelievable. We would have them warm it up every night when we left for dinner and when we came back to our room the water was like a jacuzzi. It was still warm in the morning and we would go swimming after we had out pastries just prior to going to breakfast. Then it would cool off for afternoon swimming and then we would have it warmed up again that night. The first night they just happened to be having a barbecue on the beach. The night was perfect and the food was amazing! I have never had so much lobster in my life! Our waiters were great. We became friends with all of them and they make sure that you are happy at all times. Ask/look for Carlos. He is the best. Tell him Cary and Angie said hello! The staff always call you by your name and remember any special needs/wants that you have throughout your entire stay. The motto of the hotel is that no request is too much. They do everything in their power to give you anything that you want. From the second you step onto the property you know you are somewhere special. It is small, intimate and magical. I know, I sound like a freak, but it was just so amazing. The first night they also left us a journal that they had hand written a note to us in. The spa was great as well. The couples massage in the Jungle room was great. And the Tezmacul was a moving, unique experience. I took advantage of all the showers, jacuzzi and steam room three times and I never saw anyone else in there. It was as if it was reserved just for me. And it smells great!!!! The outside shower was one of our favorites!! You will never use the indoor shower! You must have dinner on the sand with the tiki lights around you. The food was great. Breakfast was unbelievable. Drinks were strong. Do your self a favor and not pay any attention to how much money you are spending. If you are lucky enough to be at Ikal, truly enjoy the whole experience. Even my husband (who doesn't spend money as freely as i do!) said that it was worth every penny. And on top of everything, we met another couple that we have stayed in contact with and will be life long friends! The only negatives- Use the bug spray they give you in your villa. The sand fleas are terrible. It is rather rocky in front of the hotel. Therefore, either go down the beach a way and it is perfect, or go to the end of the peir and go in from there. Ok, I will stop. I tried to warn you that I would ramble. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need any additional information. email me at: vandenavond1@comcast.net Bottom line - Go to Ikal.

The following review is extremely objective and should not in any way deter people from travelling to this wonderful resort. I found ikal del mar through extensive research on the internet, looking at trip advisor, and also various upmarket travel brochures, i would say the majority of the reviews on trip advisor are extremely representative of this resort. We were looking for a quiet hideaway, far away from the gross over americanisation of Cancun. Ikal del Mar was the antithesis of Canucun in every way, small, chic, and charmingly rustic yet with all the mod cons. The villas were beautifully appointed, simple but stylish. The bathroom was very spacious, and the patio with the plunge pool very relaxing. I had a number of spa treatments, which were all perfectly adequate but did not compare to other spa resorts I have been to, namely pankgor laut, Malaysia, Chiva Som Thailand, I could go on but won't bore you!! Further, they were exceptionally expensive, $165 for a massage, I come from London(accepted as a fairly expensive city) and this would have been dear over here. I can't imagine that the mexican masseurs make the same salaries as London masseurs, so why are they charging such high prices? We also partook in yoga every morning with Samuel, this I highly recommend, Samuel is a very patient and competent teacher, it was a great start to the day!! The beach was nice, although a little rocky to swim in, as other reviewers point out, there are much nicer beaches up the coast towards Tulum. That is not to say you can't swim, you can, you just have to walk up the beach for about 3 minutes to find beautiful clear water. The Pool area is Ok, a little cramped for my liking. I will now talk about the food, which I feel is the resorts real downfall. The breakfast is fine, in fact if you like eggs then you will love it, I have never seen eggs done in so many different ways!! I think eggs must be a staple part of Mexican diets. However, lunch and dinner I found fairly uninspiring. The prices again are exorbitant, again it is like eating out in a good London restaurant, prices like these could be justified if they were importing expensive foreign food products, but to their credit they were using fresh seasonal mexican produce. In terms of the cooking it was fairly unexceptional, generally over fussy, with flavous and ingredients not really melding together very well. Further, you were charged an extra 10% if you wanted any meal, apart from breakfast, served in your room, a charge I find rather unacceptable considering the room rates per night!! I don't want to end this review on a negative note, by and large we were really happy with the resort, the staff were overly helpful and accomodating, they were so good natured. In fact we found the mexican people in general so lovely, this was one of the highlights of our trip, and this was not just confined to the hotel we stayed in, taxi drivers, people who worked in playa all exceeded any expectations we had.

One of the important things to do when you get to Cancun airport is ignore all the heckling locals in the lobby and the plethora of porters outside the door - it's a little confusing looking for the driver from Ikal since he stays outside (we expected to see him in the arrivals terminal with all the other limo folk). He holds a little wooden sign with your name on it - that's your fella! Dunno what happened to the Hummer I previously read about in these reviews - we had a sedan of some type which was not the right choice once you hit the dirt road Ikal is on. What you will have read in the other reviews all holds true in that it is expensive ($20 for a couple of eggs at breakfast, etc), yeah the beach is rocky (but use the pier to get to the deeper water or just walk on up the beach to the sandy bits) and yes there are bugs - that mosquito net around the bed isn't there for it's aesthetic value! Bugs - On our first night my wife woke me up to tell me there was some kind of bug on the floor - (shes scared of all creepy crawly type stuff). Having grown up in the middle of nowhere in Ireland and used to seeing and squashing all manner of wee beasties I woke up and grabbed a tissue from the bathroom - upon my return to the bedroom and closer inspection, I saw that the bug was indeed a small scorpion! Squashing these things with a tissue doesn't work - the little fella popped back into shape and charged straight for me. Luckily my shoe did a better job :-) Nothing like that to wake you up! My wife -bless her- thought it was some kind of mutant Mexican earwig -heh heh- and I didn't bother telling her it's true identity until we were leaving. Apart from that, we saw lots of friendly little lizards (and one huge Iguana) and the only other thing that gave us pause was the black snake we ran into going to breakfast one morning. The local birds on the other hand are great and make some great 'you're in the jungle' noises :-D The Spa - was great - my wife and I got the couples massage - and the steam room / whirlpool are spot on. Most of the time you can get the spa to yourself. Dining - most nights we ate in Playa, where you can get good local food at reasonable rates. At Ikal, you'll pay $25 upwards for a main course and the food is good, though it didn't blow us away. My favourite was the steak and my wife's the lobster ceviche. A/C - yeah it was a little loud, since your palapa is backed up right against someone elses, but is it really bothersome? Probably only to those people who have 'central air' and not window units like we do at home. Playa - nice 'n close and figure a taxi ride will cost you about $10 or so. Ikal have a van that goes into town at 4pm every day, returning at 6.30pm - just enough time to buy souvenirs and back for dinner! In fact, you are better of staying in town and getting some nice comida y cervezas and cabbing it back later. Things we liked - the Mayan wedding ceremony that was part of our package, the service, the moon shower, the pastries n coffee in the morning, the people we met there, the free mini bar (replenished daily with 2 beers and soda / juice), daily updates on your running total sent to your room (no cash used at Ikal -just mention your villa name to your server to be charged for stuff). Things we didn't like - the bugs, the lack of frequent cleaning of our plunge pool (dead frogs ahoy), the saucy prices Ikal charge (BYOB), lack of watersports available (if you're not a diver, you're outta luck), crockery / cutlery / glassware etc from previous nights room service - some stuff left there for a couple of days attracting flies and the like (one lady we met there said she was awoken buy some indigenous animal breaking stuff trying to get at food scraps one night). So did we like it - yeah. Would we go back? Probably not. 5 nights for us was enough and we found ourselves itching for stuff to do after that. Luckily we had 5 more nights booked into Disney's Wilderness Lodge in Orlando to look forward to and that was awesome, but that's an entirely different review! It must be the only time i've looked at stuff in Disney (menu's, drinks etc) and thought -wow, thats cheap! I guess all part of the Ikal experience.

I too had very high expectations based upon my research and other reveiews here and for the most part found Ikal very accomodating and nice - some minuses keep it from my personal highest ratings which go to two other Mexican resorts - Casa Que Canta and Los Alamandas, The good: VERY well trained and attentive staff. They truly do make you feel welcome and were always available. I like the fact that there are no name tags and they are familiar with you and encourage the same. The servers were particularly good and would come to know your preferences after a day or two. Special little touches like hand made soap -carved from upon arrival from large blocks into small bars for you in your room- we had lemon and chocolate - nice touch. The outdoor moon shower is really VERY nice - nothing beats showering outside with great pressure and high end rainfall fixtures - a nice little unexpected luxury in the warm sun on your private back porch. The spa - very nice and high end - also not heavily used while we were there so they allowed my wife and I run of one side (it is seperate for men/women) by ourselves - nice steam, jacuzzi and 4 different power showers each with different fixtures - vey nice. The beds/linens - luxurious, high thread counts comfy and nice. maid service 2x daily was great - they know when you are out of your room as they all have wirelss/earpieces and whenever you return, your villa has been serviced. Breakfast - the BEST - lots of interesting /unique choices (pumpkin blossom crepes)and great coffee - very liesurely and relaxed. The beach - long expansive walks particularly to the north (away from Playa Del Carmen) you can easily walk several miles (hours) in either direction. The front right where Ikal is , is not swimable TOO rocky - follow others advice and go about 300 yards to the north and it is pristine. The bad: Plunge pool in our (all) villa - was freezing, it would have been nice if it were heated - I think they mentioned something about letting them know and they would do it but I though what is up with that, why isn't it always heated. LOUD a/c - gotta have it, but really was distracting from serenity of environs to have it cutting on/off all the time - not just your unit but others surrounding as well - we loved to read on our patio but that LOUD whir all the time was distracting. Value - All said before but it really did seem outrageous for the meals, especially dinner - $9 for a scoop of ice cream? - look we are all on vacation and staying there you expect to pay a premium but add 20% service and its ridiculous. Pathways - this is quirky, nice and weird all at the same time. Nothing is marked, NOTHING - all the villas are secluded on winding paths cut into the jungle- no signs, no directional markers nothing \"its just like home\" they said but after the 10th time you get lost it starts to be annoying - there are little tricks - the wide paths are transit, the narrow lead to the villas but it gets hairy at night especially after a few cerverzas. Also they have mold on them in some places and can be quite slippery so be warned. The bugs - I have never encoutered bugs in Mexico other than ants - I have always been on the Pacific side and there have not been bad mosquitos - here they are BAD and no see ums also - beware especially at dusk- they are not ruin your trip bad but just more pronounced than I was planning for and I did not use spray til it was too late. The way the handled evacuation with the Hurricane was also very professional and no complaints there as they were on top of things making arrangements EARLY.

In fact, if you knew me personally, you would know that this place HAS to be fantastic for me to use the word \"romantic\". We had not been away together since our honeymoon some three years ago, and we were both \"running on empty\" so to speak from dealing with our kids, jobs, etc. etc. Ikal really hit the spot. It was the perfect place. I lived in Manhattan for a while, and still live in the NYC metropolitan area, so, I had very high expectations for what Ikal should deliver, especially at the prices being charged. Exiting the airport at Cancun was not quite pleasant, as we were bombarded by hawkers trying to sell us trips, tours, and the like, and the area to meet our driver was not very clearly indicated. I wish someone would have prepared me for that part of the trip, since it was the only \"negative\" I can think of, yet obviously not completely within the control of the hotel. But our driver did find us rather quickly, took our bags, and escorted us to the car, where refreshments were waiting. The car ride was about 45 minutes, and uneventful, notwithstanding the final approach to the hotel, which, as other reviewers have said, was pretty scary due to construction, potholes, and whatever you might consider the antithesis of scenic. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by \"Sonia\" (young, multi-lingual, vibrant) who set the tone for our stay. She was warm, so polite and congenial, yet cordial and most professional, with an almost self-deprecating style that could be found in all of the staff at Ikal. Genuinely, she was excited for the two of us, about the property (Ikal), and obviously enjoys her job- again, qualities that were found in all the staff, and more importantly, something with which my wife and I became \"infected\" during our stay. The property is comprised of these really cool (architectually) villas off of small, winding paths through a jungle. There are only some 29 villas. If anyone is wondering, THERE WAS NO NOTICEABLE DAMAGE TO THE RESORT FROM THE HURRICANES. And while I am here, let me advise that this is NO PLACE FOR CHILDREN, and certainly nothing like the spring break party atmosphere of Cancun. Anyway, the villas are unique in that it gave my wife and I the opportunity to be as private as we wanted to, or more social, say, by going to the main pool or restaurant. There are no room numbers- rather, the villas are uniquely designated by names of romantic poets. Ours had a book of the poet's works. Villas are spacious and comfortable, complete with a double-sink bathroom, outdoor shower, private dipping pool, and outdoor sitting area with a hammock. Ours was very quiet, except for the sounds of nature (birds, crickets, or whatever). We had air conditioning, but it wasnt loud or disturbing, as I had read in one of the bizarre negative reviews. And it was very very clean- even the outdoor shower and plunge pool. To be sure, whenever my wife and I left the villa (to go to the restaurant, pool, beach, etc.) the villa was cleaned and serviced. I was tense about the ant and mosquitoes I read about in another one of the bizarre negative reviews. But I found myself really straining to find any ants whatsoever, and any that I did find, were outside, not inside the villa. The mosquitoes werent really a problem either, although we got a few bites. The spa, while expensive, was really amazing. I highly recommend the Crepuscular massage- schedule it to start around sunset, and in the \"Jungle Cabin\". It was so relaxing, especially the part where they massage your entire body with this volcanic mud stuff to the beat of ancient mayan music. At the end of the treatment, my wife and I, completely naked and covered in black mud (out of sight of others, of course), had a blast dancing around this jungle room pretending we were mayans while the music kept playing. The staff at the spa is incredibly professional, attentive, and acommodating. The restaurant was never crowded. The staff literally ran around in helping us. The entire wait staff was wonderful, especially \"Luis\". I thought the food was so fresh, the dishes so creative, and really, I loved everything about the dining experience. We did not eat out on the beach, but we saw another couple do so- I would recommend doing it for sure. I was worried about there being only one restaurant, but, there is so much variety on the menu, and you can have your meal anywhere you want it- at the villa, poolside, on the beach, in the jungle- really, wherever- so that wasnt an issue at all. The pool was clean, and never crowded. Plenty of seating, a lot of attention by the staff for drinks, towels, or whatever you need. The beach was also clean, but rocky. Swimming isn't really very nice, but there are places you can go safely where the water is about waist high. What's great are the lounge chairs on the beach, and of course the staff provides great service wherever you are on the beach. In fact, I mentioned to \"Alejandro\" (wait staff) in passing that I had forgotten to bring some reading material to the beach. He actually ran, brought a phone onto the beach where I was, connected me to the front desk, and voila! books for my wife and I arrived within a few minutes.

If you really really want to have a BAD time here, you will have to try very very hard. But I dont think the staff will let you. Our trip did wonders for our marriage.

I must say at the time I wasn't too thrilled, I had been to Cancun several times and really had no desire to go back. I was jealous of the others who had one trips to London or Hawaii. But free is free so Wooo Hoooo!!! I had invited my best friend and we were going to have our girls trip. Low and behold I met a great guy, and after knowing him only 6 weeks (crazy huh?), I took him instead. Ali, THANK YOU for the your sacrifice and the great friend you are!! I thank God that I took him, my entire life changed! First let me say that this is a far from Cancun as possible, not by distance, but by class!! I had no idea what to expect, which made it even better. We drove through a construction site and ended up at a lobby, if you could call it that, more of a walkway with beautiful stone. We were met by Laurence (sp?), who took us through a beautiful maze of walkways through amazing foliage and streams, and brought us to our own bungalow. The entire time, she guided us, pointing out the amenities, my boyfriend and I just kept making eye contact thinking, \"This is absolutely incredible!\". The funny thing about this trip is that it rained almost the entire time, and yet it was the best three nights of my life!! OK, OK so you are thinking, it must've been the company I was with, well this is partly true. I think of how my friend and I would have been completely out of place in this incredibly romatic setting. Even love poems were left on our pillows printed on pressed paper, scroll tied with rafia. My new boyfriend and I treated ourselves to a couples massage, again it was raining, but it added to the beauty of it, listening to the rainfall made it even better. At the end of the massage, a beautiful poem was read to us, by candlelight, and she joined our hands, we really haven't let go since. We've been madly in love since this incredible trip to such an amazing place. We've since married and are going back next month!!! Not only are we going back, but my best friend is getting married in September and spending her honeymoon there! My parents are also staying there for their 50th wedding anniversary. The best type of marketing is word of mouth!! and I've been spreading the word for the past two years to anyone who will listen. Yes, the food is expensive!!! but in paradise, you don't think about anything but the scenery and the person you are with. With your own private bungalow, your own private plunge pool, the outdoor shower (why even bother with an indoor one, even in the rain!) We probably saw eight other people the entire time we were there. It was a private oasis, and it felt like it was provided just for us. If you are looking for a party, look elsewhere, this is for those who want to connect with themselves, with eachother, and with nature. There are many nice, all inclusive resorts for adults out there for less money. You can take a vacation there. This is NOT just another vacation, this is a mental makeover. Make this a special occasion! Save money so you can splurge!! Charge it and worry about it later, we did and don't regret a dime we spent!! Definitely go to the Spa! and most importantly, take the one you love! You'll fall in love again. I truly felt this place has a certain magic to it. (how sappy is that?) but my husband agrees. I've traveled a lot, been to several countries, beautfiul resorts, large and small and this one is at the TOP of the list. I've attached pictures, one of them my husband had enlarged and framed as a gift for me. This picture seems edited, too perfect, but it isn't, it's Ikal del Mar, what can I say?", "Date": "July 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cThe Skinny\u201d", "Author": "sixtoe", "ReviewID": "UR3664439", "Content": "There are plenty of reviews here outlining what a wonderful place Ikal is, so let me sum up by saying that Ikal is one of the most beautiful resorts my wife and I have stayed at in the world. The service is very good (if a little slow by hurried US standards). Each suite perfectly melds modern design with traditional construction. It's tough to find an experience like this anywhere else. That said, here's some of the things you need to know: Electric outlets are US-style. Bring your iPod charger, cell phone charger, etc. and power up. If you're travelling from the US, bring a passport or certified birth certificate. They're not essential now, but they will be in 2006 (and you can't go to US Airways check-in kiosks without a valid passport number.) Bring your own wine and liquor from home or your departing airport's duty free shop. More on that later. The road into Ikal is no longer a jungle as some descibed thanks to extensive condo development. I'll keep all comments on this to myself. We were cautioned to apply mosquito repellant any time we were outdoors. I think I was bit once or twice in five days. If you've ever been fishing on a lake or bay, you'll be just fine here. No worries about bugs. The private pool didn't seem cold to me. Compared to the bathwater ocean, maybe. But it's comfortable. Privacy: Our place was private. We saw one that probably wasn't. I showered in the nude every afternoon at our outdoor moon shower. If an employee really wanted to see my white a-- nekkid, I suppose they could have snuck a peek. But I'm not much to look at. Consider your appearance and shower accordingly. Nightlife: There isn't any. If this bothers you, go to Sandals (cue bad 'Dirty Dancing' cover) or go to Playa del Carmen. I told myself \"everyone complains about the prices of the food and drinks at Ikal...don't be that person...you're on vacation, let it go.\" Then you go to dinner, and you realize that the food is rather good, it's not out-of-this-world great. But you're paying the same prices you would pay at a top restaurant like a Striped Bass in Philadelphia. Then you go to lunch the next day, and see a $15 tuna sandwich and a $20 hamburger. And you get your first daily bill for the drinks you had, and realized you could have bought a case of local beer for the price you paid for one Corona. And you remember the first time you had a mojito at the Skybar in L.A. five years ago and being taken about by the fact that they were $12 a pop, but here they're $15...or was it more? You can't tell, because your daily bill isn't itemized, it just lists things like \"Rest. Azul, $18\" and \"Servico AyB, $27.64\" and you start to do this psychological dance in your head where you try to relax and remind yourself that you're in paradise but you can't get over the feeling that you're just a dumb gringo that's getting taken by the locals. And it STINGS. My advice: Take advantage of the complimentary drinks they leave you in your room every day. And bring booze. If you have enough, you might be able to run your own little side business from the comfort of your palapa. Charge double what you paid at the duty free, you'll still be cheaper than Ikal, and your room will pay for itself. In fact, I might live at Ikal permanently and do just that. The Beach: There's some rocks. There's a few places you can walk around them just to the left of the pier and stand in chest high water as far as you can walk out to the horizon. If you don't like that, there's a very accessible spot just to the left of the resort. Put it this way, it's not nearly a big deal as everyone makes it out to be. The soap lady speaks no English. Don't say I didn't warn you. We didn't eat on the beach at night, but we saw a couple who did. It looked very romantic. Except for the gail force winds. The week we stayed, the restaurant intruduced a number of new authentic Mayan food items to the menu. Eat them. Chef Erick trained hard with local cooks to learn how to make them the traditional way. The chocolate steak was also terriffic, but nobody would give me the recipe no matter how many $22 drinks I bought. The Big Mistake is one of those undercooked chocolate cakes with the warm, gooey, runny center. The one a had at La Sport in St. Lucia was unforgettable. The Big Mistake at Ikal is that they overcooked it so it became a $15 brownie. Que lastima! That's about it. The good, the bad, the ugly. Mostly all good. Some great. Pequeno ugly.

From the moment we were greeted by Marisol to the moment we checked out, we were spoiled, spoiled, spoiled. To be fair, I will list the pros and cons that we found: Pros: Service you don't get everywhere else. For example, when you are looking for a place to sit on the beach or pool, you are helped so that you can be as comfortable as possible. Every chair has towels, there are cute Mexican sombreros to wear, etc. You never have to worry about a thing! The rooms are very romantic. The outdoor shower is a great highlight, as well as the private plunge pool. We woke up the first morning to the sound of birds, and I can honestly say I've never been that relaxed. The bed is heaven.......The room is cleaned twice a day, and the toiletries are also great. The food is delicious, though very pricy. This is a place to relax & forget about the world. We had a private dinner in our villa that was unforgettable. And the SPA, I have to say, was the #1 highlight for us. It was like being in the jungle and hearing the trees and smelling the amazing scents they have.......it was just great. Cons The location is not that great. If you want to stay in the hotel the whole time, it's a great getaway. We went to Playa one night and it was just so touristy, hot, crowded and not our thing....... Prices!!! We felt we couldn't afford a margarita ($14) or a bottle of wine (can't even remember) so we stuck to expensive beer. We understand it's a luxury place, but ouch! We felt poor at times. If you want to splurge and forget the world, then who cares? We were just a bit traumatized=) Summary If you want total luxury and to be spoiled and have the $, definitely try this place. I'd say 4 days was more than enough time for us, though. We like to explore as well, and didn't feel like we liked this area of Mexico as much as others.

There he was at 4am in his car when our flight was suppose to arrive at 2am. At the resort they quickly got us to our room where there were cheese, fruit, crackers and wine waiting for us since they knew we might be hungry after such an ordeal with the flight. After resting we were delivered the delightful pastries and coffee on our beautiful patio. These little villas are so spacious it is really like having your own little private home. The resort is small and there are not many guests. In fact you can traverse one of their paths and not even see a soul except for the many workers tidying up the place. It seemed at though there were about six workers to every one guest. While on the beach they bring you ice cold towels (literally with the ice often still there) to wipe your face and cool you off. The breeze off the beach and the hum of the waves was enough to put me to sleep for days. Between the morning coffee and pastries and breakfast (complimentary) that could be taken until 11am, we had no need for a lunch time meal. We ate at the hotel for dinner twice. The food was excellent and the service was extraordinary. We ate one day in town and though it was cheaper the quality of food was far inferior. The shuttle went from 4-6:30 and we really didn't see a need to stay longer. Carlos in the office was wonderful in catering to our every need. There was internet available in the office in order to communicate with our four children back at home. They also were very accomodating to bring ice to our room as often as we asked for it.

But when a palapa awaits with a padded recliner aimed at the soft torquise blue Carribean, why be hermits? Especially when an hour didn't pass without being offered an icy towel by one of the many staff members who went above and beyond to make our stay as memorable as humanly possible. As an example, we brought to the beach some J champagne left over from our wedding. Before our sandals were flipped off, Carlos was walking toward us with an ice bucket and two flutes!

For example, every 2 days a summary of room charges magically appeared in our room (could there be secret tunnels?). But I had to visit the front office for an explanation of what those charges included. Next time I will request that the entire bill be enclosed for review. As for food, breakfasts and lunches were fantastic, as was \"the Big Mistake\", for which I'm still running extra miles to offset damage done! Dinners were fine, but below the standard set by the earlier meals. Dinners in Playa were very tasty and inexpensive. But the setting at Ikal more than offsets the savings in Playa. On the other hand, the strolling troubadors on 5th Avenue were not that bad! The weather cooperated fully with our schedule of daily activilties. Of course, we had no schedule of daily activities other than to enjoy each other on our heavenly honeymoon. We will definately return, though I will try harder to resist The Big Mistake!

The facilities are excellent and we really enjoyed relaxing near the beach. The villas are beautiful, especially the plunge pool and outdoor shower. Other reviewers have done a wonderful job providing an overview of why this is a special place. The reason we did not give it an \"excellent\" rating is that for $625 per night (and $750+ per night with taxes, service charges), the expectation is that there will be very few (if any) imperfections. Similar to other reviewers, we found the air conditioners to be quite loud - so much so that during the first night I had a hard time sleeping due to the loud sound of our air conditioner. Fortunately, the weather cooled a bit and we did not need to use it much after the first night. Another slightly annoying part of the experience was the push to get guests to eat at the restaurant - which began with several pitches in the the introduction materials (which were given to us in Spanish originally, then after calling to the front desk, again in Spanish and then finally in English after another call) and continued throughout the stay. This is one area where I differ from many of the reviews - the food at Ikal is okay, nothing special, especially if you are used to eating at similarly priced restaurants in major US cities (San Francisco, LA, Chicago, New York, etc.). In fact, our best meals from our stay were in Playa, we especially enjoyed an Argentinian restaurant (forget the name) which had great empanadas and wonderful steaks (it is on the primary street in Playa, on the north end of the street) and an Italian place called Casa Mediterr\u00e1nea which has wonderful pastas and an incredible atmosphere.

Long Review: My girlfriend and I stayed at Ikal from March 20 - 27, 2005. When we finally cleared customs in Cancun (which took close to 2 hours), we were met by Jonathan, who drove us to Ikal. Jonathan didn't speak a lot of English which was a bit frustrating as we had questions about the area, what we saw as we drove, etc. The road into Ikal is _interesting_. If I were arriving at night, I would probably have been a little worried. When we arrived, we were greeted by Marisol (sp?). We were given a cool, wet washcloth and a cold bottle or water. When I originally booked, I had requested the package with 8 hours of spa treatments for each person. After consulting Ikal and discovering I couldn't transfer the hours I did not use to my girlfriend, I asked the package to be changed to a regular 7 night package. The price we were quoted when we arrived still had the original, more expensive package. Fortunately, I printed off all emails between myself and the staff just for such a case. Had other reviewers not metioned the communication problems with the front desk, I probably wouldn't have brought the emails along with me. Regardless, they said they would fix the rate and would give us a copy (we never saw it). We were off to see our villa. The jungle is beautiful as you walk through it on your way to your villa. Wide paths you stay on; narrow paths lead to a villa. We stopped at the spa (gorgeous!), had a Mayan cleansing ceremony performed on us, saw the \"Jungle Room\" (an extra $20 if you're having a massage), and the men's and women's facilities. Pictures on their web site do not do it justice. When I originally booked, I specifically asked for a very private villa, not on the main path. We were given Gutierrez Najera (each villa is named after a poet). Gutierrez is the first villa after the Presidential villa, off the main path. Not what I asked for. The pool is fairly well secluded, especially when you compare some of the other villas along the main path, though a walkway behind our villa was clearly visible (staff used this path for the most part). The noise from the Presidential's air conditioner and pool pump were definitely annoying at times. I asked for another villa that met my request, but was informed that nothing else was available. My girlfriend liked that it was close to the pool and beach, so we stuck with it. The interior was beautiful. Soft bed, cool linens, stocked bar fridge, and Kohler fixtures all gave you a feeling of luxury. My girlfriend fell in love with the Moulton Brown bath products and outdoor shower. Our first night, I thought I kept hearing birds fighting on top of our villa. After some more investigating the following day, I discovered it was the air conditioner. I called the front desk the next day and they sent over someone to look into it. The verdict was that it would take 7 or 8 hours to fix it. I went and complained that we were being inconvenienced as we couldn't have our air conditioning on at night or we had to set it so low that it never shut off. I was given the option of switching villas to something else. After weighing our options, I thought we were better off staying where we were and having the repairman come the next day. It took him over 8 hours to fix the problem, forcing us to stay out of our villa for the day (which wasn't really a problem with the nice weather). We were rewarded (?) with a nice bottle of wine later on that night for our patience. We ate at Azul, the onsite restauarant, 4 of the 7 nights. We found the food and wait staff to be excellent. We came for dessert one night and met Elias, one of the wait staff. We talked about Mexican food and the area. The next night we came for dinner, he had the kitchen create a _huge_ plate with a variety of Mexican dishes for us. A pleasant surprise! Elias is representative of most of the staff at Ikal. They come to know you by name and vice versa. Language can occasionally be a barrier, but they try their best. If there's something you want and it's not on the menu, ask! If they have it, they'll happily make it for you. Breakfast was equally delicious. The only drawback was how quickly the coffee got cold due to the windy conditions we experienced. If Ikal arranges a ride into Playa, it will cost you $10 USD. They offer a shuttle daily at 4:30 and returning at 6 or 6:30 (I can't recall which as we never took it). We thought it didn't give you enough time to get back, so we ended up cabbing it back from Playa. A cab back should cost you between 70 and 80 pesos. Some tried to charge more (100). We decided to go to Tulum and Xel Ha and booked a car and driver to take us ($150 USD for the day). I was disappointed with both. Tulum no longer allows you to climb the ruins, which I guess I can understand. Xel Ha is what it is. If you go, bring an old pair of flip flops. The pathways and locker areas are disgusting. Both left me longing for the tranquility of Ikal. I can't really comment on the spa. The only treatment I had was a couple's massage in the Jungle Room. I've had a few massages at resorts and this was as good as any I've had. The Jungle Room was an excellent experience. It was relaxing to hear the waterfall and the wind rustling through the trees around you. The beach is as others have commented. The sand is wonderful, without a lot of the broken shell pieces that other sections of the beach suffer from that can make walking on it uncomfortable. The section in front of the resort is rocky for about the first 10 metres. If you wade out, it's fine. The pier also allows you to get around the rocks. Walking a couple of minutes provides you with a rock-free entry into the ocean. The staff were very attentive during our stay. They helped you move chairs and came around to offer you water or a wet towel or to take your order. Beach security was good except on the weekend. We found that a lot of people were walking up to the resort to check it out as they passed by or using the pier; on those days I felt uneasy leaving my possessions on my chair. We'll definitely be back. Through wandering around, we saw some other villa's we would like to try next time. Hopefully, our request will be met.

What an incredibly unique luxury experience. The resort has a very high level of service and pampering, but what makes it so unique is the design. It is carved out of the jungle, a tamed jungle, but a jungle none the less. There were even a few waterfalls. Each thatched roof villa is a standalone unit with two sinks, indoor shower, outdoor shower, small refrigerator, TV, Stereo, CD/DVD player, phone, covered terrace and heated plunge pool. A paved pathway leads between the villas and public spaces. Another unique aspect of the resort is there is no requirement to sign for anything. Breakfast was included, but when we ordered a drink by the pool or on the beach, when we ate lunch and dinner, there was no signing. An updated bill was delivered to your villa every other day so you could make sure there were no mistakes. I personally loved this policy as I hate to have to sign for everything all the time. The food was outstanding. I liked some dishes more than others, but that was due to personal preference. All dishes were of very high quality and well presented. The pool always had chairs available including 4 that were shaded. The beach had 12 or 13 thatched roof covers providing shade for chairs. Some days these would fill up. You could even order lunch on the beach and they would bring it out to you on very nice TV trays. This place is serious pampering. I also had a wonderful massage in the Spa. We went into Playa Del Carmine 2 of our 7 nights (5 miles away). The resort runs a free shuttle daily. We ate at Yaxche, which was a marvelous Mayan restaurant and John Grey which was an exquisite gourmet restaurant. 5th avenue is a great pedestrian only street to browse and shop. The only down side is the fact that there are a few bugs. Mostly nats, they were not aggressive like US nats so it was not bad. They provide repellant spray for your terrace.

I am a romantic. This place fit the bill. Everything about this resort reeks romance. From the time I checked in (which was midnight due to a flight delay) until the day I checked out. When I got there a shot of tequila was waiting for me. I couldn't get to see the resort due to darkness but when I saw my room , I thought I was in heaven. The room was so private ( Mistral room) that I could have stayed there for a whole week. The outside of the room was the best part because of the private pool and the bed outside that I thought I was in heaven. Also the outside moon shower was great. The staff was inpeccable. There wasn't a thing I wanted for. They got to know me and they were at my beckon call. As everyone says about the beach--it is true-a little rocky in front but if you go to either the left or the right a few steps you will be fine. The food was great at the restaurant.

With four kids under the age of five, no vacation in 3 1/2 years and a surprise 40th birthday present, we knew it was going to be virtually impossible for any resort to meet our vacation needs and desires, but Ikal del Mar did it. That is why I am taking the time to write this review. The most impressive thing of all was the beautiful spirit of the staff and their desire to make our vacation one filled with peacefulness and tranquility. They were so accomodating; they made us feel like we were the only ones at the resort. Although we love ocean views, seclusion was paramount for us on this rare opportunity of uninterrupted togetherness, so we were happy to have the privacy the layout of the resort offered. The spa was great and the \"jungle suite\" was definitely worth the extra $ 20 per person. The service was wonderful as well. With only 60 people at the resort when it is full, it was very easy to get any service we wanted when we wanted it. The only inconvenience was that the women's steam area was not working so we had to use the mens. The villas were immaculate. With all the villa accomodations- the private pool, the outdoor shower, dvd player and room service.... oh yea and Molton Brown toiletries.... we never needed to leave our room. But when we decided it was time to venture out, we had the most gorgeous views and beautiful beach only a few steps away. Ikal del Mar does 85% of it perfectly. The only real area of improvement is with the restaurant menu and lunch and dinner meals. With a five night minimum, the food got a little boring. And in terms of the quality of the meal, it needed some spicing up. My husband and I gave the breakfast an A (they do serve bacon although it is not on the menu), but lunch and dinner were a B. Another observation was that the resort could use alittle night time entertainment even if it is just a jazz trio for background music. And last, we thought the bar at the pool could use just a little sprucing up to make it a little more inviting. Having said that, being waited on pool side was a very nice amenity on our vacation. If you are reading this review, I hope you decide to go to Ikal. It is worth it. Just remember, the pace is slow and it is a place for you to completely unwind. If you are an activity nut, make sure your bring some crossword puzzles. Bon Voyage Oh, one last thing is Playa del Carmen; it was a busy place. La Parilla restaurant was awesome, but PDC was a total tourist town and it was hard to find authentic Mayan, Yucatan food. Furthermore, the souvenior prices were outrageous. Either negotiate by paying a third or wait until you get to Cancun airport. It has a lot of great shops for gifts and the prices our reasonable.", "Date": "February 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hudson, OH", "Title": "\u201cOverall.......Wonderful\u201d", "Author": "ksamorris", "ReviewID": "UR3086089", "Content": "Just returned from 6 days for our 10th Anniversary!! Overall, I would have to agree with all the previous reviews. Ikal del Mar definitely takes you to another level. Their service is amazing and by the end of the week I almost started to doubt if I was even capable of moving my own beach chair!! Negatives: There was a recurring odor of sulphur, mostly around the area our villa was (we were right next to the spa). When we inquired about it, we were told it was from the underground rivers and happens sometimes and we were offered incense. Take the incense, it helps. We also kept the recirculating fan on our a/c unit (without turning on the a/c) and this seem to move the air enough the the odor didn't build up in our villa. Before we figured these things out, we had one evening of almost unbearable odor. Knowing there is no such thing as perfection, after reading these reviews I still expected it. To be very nit-picky, this relatively new resort is starting to show some wear. The wood inlay in the marble floor was somewhat warped, there were some stains on the side of our pool, the large sliding doors did not line up well (we actually had to replace our key because it bent so badly trying to lock and unlock our door), and a musty smell from the a/c. We had some ants our last night there and there were some \"inchworm-y\" type bugs also. I am extremely prone to mosquito bites and used the spray every evening--it helped. The morning \"eye-opener\" was wonderful, my husband had coffee and I had tea. Some mornings there was not much cream and very little sugar, we had to call for more. We also were apparently at the end of the line as it was supposed to arrive b/w 7-8 and ours came anywhere b/w 7:50-8:15. Positives: We didn't find the frozen drinks to be expensive as previously discussed. The bill came every other day to keep us updated and it was a little confusing to figure out. From what we could tell we had a charge of around $43.00 USD for 2 Coronas and 3 Cabanas (frozen strawberry/banana drink--yummy!!). That did not include the service. From what we had read, we expected it to be more. Food was wonderful. The shrimp and asparagus appetizer was amazing, cactus soup very good. Shrimp entrees were very good, steak entree ok, lobster was wonderful, duck pasta was wonderful. For dessert you HAVE to try \"The Big Mistake\"!!! It is the best molten chocolate cake we have ever had (and we have two great examples in area restaurants here!). The cheapest glass of wine is $11 US and mixed drinks (Absolut & cranberry, Bailey's on the rocks) did seem to inflate the bill (hard to tell without an itemized statement). As said before, breakfast are wonderful. Make sure to get the fresh fruit, also the Marisol omelette, Mexican omelette and eggs benedict. Spa treatments were very nice, though not extremely therapeutic. Some of the smells were amazing. We did the temezcal also. It was an incredible experience but really get details on it before you book it. We started with 5 people and ended with 3. It can be tough to get through. We took a trip to the Coba ruins and arranged our transportation with Ikal. A day before we told them when we wanted to go and one of their drivers (Alberto) met us in the lobby at the specified time. They said it would be about 4 hours, but our tour in Coba took longer and our stop in the Mayan village of Hu-May took some time. We had Alberto drop us in Playa del Carmen and it was already 6 hours after we had left. They did not charge us extra ($150 USD). Everything at Ikal is in US dollars. The shuttle from Ikal to Playa was nice, also. We took it into Playa once and stayed later so we didn't take it back. A taxi only cost $8 USD, make sure to arrange price before you get in. Also, get mapchick's map of Playa del Carmen before you go so you get an idea of where things are. It can be a little confusing when the shuttle drops you off if you've never been there before and don't know where anything is. If you are really into snorkelling, bring your own snorkel. The ones the hotel provides are very basic, but their masks and swim fins are fine. Sea was too choppy for 4 of 6 days we were there. Also, quite chilly when the sun wasn't out. Oh, and the main pool was freezing. The only people we saw go in were the couple getting their scuba lesson. Wonderful experience, they do an amazing job making you relax and let go of all your stress.

That being said, when I am going to what I expect to be one of the best hotels in the world- my expectations are high. Furthermore, just to give a hint of how great this place is, in the last year I have been to Cap Juluca and Maroma and I think this is a superior property. Enough of the disclaimers, on with the review. Rooms: The rooms are great, simple yet elegant. The bed has wonderful sheets and linens, although the mattress was unusually hard. Bathrooms are very nice and immaculately clean and the outdoor shower has great water pressure. The porch area is nice and the private pool is a welcome addition, you can get the pool heated up to a very nice (almsot hot tub like) tempature which makes the night time swimming great. The stereo is also nice, so bring some cds. On the negative side of the rooms: (1) The rooms are strangely close together, they are independent units, but our pool and porch were no more than 10 feet from the neighboring room, we could see straight into the room and pool area. You could hear your neighbors moving around at night etc. (2) The rooms are all very close to the paths that go throughout the hotel, our outdoor shower was no more than 3 feet from the path and w/ the gaps in the foliage you could look straight in. (3) They could get some nicer and more comfortable furniture for the porch area. (4) I knew this in advance, but no rooms are on the water, and some are far away (5 minute walk). The Beach Positives: The beach is also very nice and very long, you can walk for over an hour in each direction, we never got to the end. The sea is rocky in front of the hotel, but you can go to the end of the dock to jump in or walk 2 minutes down the beach to go swimming. The beach chairs were very comfortable and the guys are always there with towells and drinks. The Beach Negatives: (1) All beaches in Mexico are public which was not a problem for us, but Ikal has placed chairs only on about 50 yards of the beach which means you feel like you are sitting very close to other guests of the hotel, which is strange because the hotel is so private. If they could spread out more it would be great. (2) Not enough shady spots, you have to be at the beach by 9 am to claim one. Pool: very beautiful- but extremely cold- they really need to heat it in the winter months. Service: Overall excellent, very nice and professional and tons of people around, but sometimes it was spotty, like having 4 beach guys watching you drag your chairs around. The only thing I would say is the staff could be more proactive by asking guests on the beach if they need anything. This does not mean the service was bad at all- it is truly wonderful everywhere in the hotel, but sometimes on the beach it was spotty. Food: Breakfast- simply awesome Lunch- Wonderful Dinner- not as good as the other two meals, it is still good, but it tries to be too fancy. They should pair the \"fancy\" stuff with some more basics and some more Mexican food. Drinks- good, Margaritas were weak on the alcohol (especially for the price) but if you tell them you want more they will fix a stronger drink. Spa: Really world class Concerns posted by other trip advisor comments: (1) I saw virtually no bugs (2) There was, at times in certain parts of the hotel, a bad sewage smell, like a septic tank was leaking. This should be addressed. (3) No noise problems from highway (4) Price- yea it is expensive, but no different than its peer hotels. (5) The road coming in- bumpy- but really who cares, it takes 5 minutes on that road and that you are at a truly great hotel. Overall: Wonderful hotel, the crowded fealing on the beach was the only thing that really bothered me, if they could just spread their chairs a little further.

Service, ambiance, atmosphere, everything was perfect, as the other reviews indicate. That said, let me point out a few... uh... notable facts. The hotel has a relatively narrow beachfront, meaning that none, but none of the villas have any views to speak of. They are all back, hidden away in the property's grounds back from the sea. However, in exchance for giving up the view of the water, you get absolute privacy. Its almost impossible to see any of the villa's living spaces (or any other verb) from any place but the entrance of the villa itself. It is expensive. And while staying there has all the convenience of an inclusive -- you never have to carry money, or sign for anything -- the restaurant and bar is gourmet level in both its cuisine and prices. It's expensive even for America, let along mexico... the cheapest thing on the dinner menu, a delicious lime soup, is $8. So be prepared to bleed great gouts of money. That said, you get what you pay for. For example, I went diving while there... which I did by strolling up to the lovely Natailie, resident Diving Babe, and said, \"I'd like to go diving.\" The next morning I was met by a private guide (Natalie!) plus all my equipment a boat, and a snack packed by the hotel. We left and returned from the dock at Ikal. Perfect. For this I paid $120... which is about twice what I would have paid if I had just driven into Playa Del Carmen and booked a trip to the same place with the same dive company (GoCenotes... I recommend them.) BUT: I got a private guide (Natalie!); didn't have to rent a car, or pack a lunch, or worry about a damn thing. I decided it was worth it. And, if you get tired of paying the money, you can rent a car or have the hotel arrange one for you, and head into Playa to eat and drink cheaper. Honestly.

After reading all the reviews and talking with other people that had been to Ikal, we decided this was the place for us!!! All the reviews posted are dead on - a private, quite, beautiful spot for relaxation and escape, with a price. A word to the wise, use the SAFE for any valuables or cash left in the room. To the staffs credit, we were able to recoup our loss after numerous inquiries. While talking with other guests, we found our experience not to be uncommon. Maybe we were naive, but we were assured upon arrival that such precautions were not necessary. Breakfast was our favorite meal of the day. Dinner was good too, but not the best we've ever had. I would advise taking the shuttle to Playa del Carmen and having dinner there once or twice if you can. Playa is filled with tourist but it's not all that bad. It's a great place to pick up some souvenirs and have dinner/drinks for something different! The Moon Shower was excellent!!! To be able to take a shower outside with great water pressure and be surrounded by the jungle was quite an experience. Also, when you arrive, they will cut you a couple pieces of soap and it smells so good. Our two favorites were the mint and lemon. We brought our left overs home with us and when we take a shower it reminds us of Ikal. The Spa was pure heaven!!! We made an appointment twice for the steam room in the evenings. When we got out, we were so relaxed and slept so good and I'm sure the plush linens helped for a good night sleep also! We had a couples massage on our patio the night before we left and it was a nice way to end the vacation! There are a few things I would recommend. If you enjoy wine or mixed drinks, bring some with you. We brought a bottle of liquor and it lasted the entire trip (8 days). I'm sure we saved a lot of money by having it with us considering a frozen drink at the bar on the beach can cost $15-$20. Also, if you enjoy music, bring some of your favorite CD's to listen to. The beach is rocky directly in front of the resort so we would take a couple of towels and walk to the left so we could swim in the ocean. Without a doubt, Ikal del Mar was a once in a lifetime experience for both of us. It was an ideal place to start our married life!!!

The basis for our choosing IDM was derived mainly from the reviews on Tripadvisor and the IDM website in addition to multiple emails with the IDM staff. Having read the reviews and experienced the property in person, I offer the following assessment. First and foremost, there are no negatives to the property or staff. All the reviews written on tripadvisor are accurate in all facets whether they are considered negative or positive (except there are no bugs to speak of plus, its the jungle). Abigail and her staff are incredibly professional and very personable which is reflected in the quality of the experience. Personal tastes will determine if negatives exist so I will not describe the property so that those who eventually stay there can formulate their own expectations prior to arrival. What I can say is that while at IDM, every time you take a moon/sun shower, you will try to figure out how to build one at home; you will want to make sure you take along your favorite CDs/DVDs for relaxing (even though some really good ones are provided); you will want to have your plung pool heated in the evenings for a relaxing swim after dinner; you will want your massages by the beach and don't forget to enjoy the sauna and showers in the spa plus you will want a good book or two. Finally, if you can, schedule your stay during a full moon (watching the total lunar eclipse from the beach was breathtaking) do it. All the while, you will feel as if you are the only ones there or on the planet for that matter. If you plan on an extended stay as we did, you will eventually want to get out and see the sights because the countryside is too beautiful not to. Playa Del Carmen is a short cab ride away and picking up a bottle of wine or two for your villas is not a bad idea (however, the wine selection in Playa is nothing compared to IDM). For a short stay, you will never leave the property. The overall ambiance and spirit is indescribable which is why most of the guests appeared to be honeymooners like us.

Set amid a fastidiously maintained and manicured jungle, the \"rooms\" are actually individual villas with their own porch, plunge pool, and outdoor shower. It was truly pefect retreat to spend time with each other - within moments we felt the stress of our wedding melt away. We purchased the timeless honeymoon package and felt it was worth every penny. Our candlelight dinner on the beach was perfect. When we arrived we found a table and chairs set in the sand flanked by torches at each corner. We sipped Dom Perignon and watched the moon rise above the ocean. The service was impeccable even down on the beach and while we felt totally alone (save for the crab that decided to crash our party) we were never left wanting for anything. The infinity pool, beach, and all the grounds were always picture perfect. They spend a great deal of energy making sure of it. The spa treatments were excellent, although we would have preferred the couple's massage to be indoors since it was above 95 degrees and humid when we had ours. We took a trip into town several times but found that after being in paradise, it was comparitively crowded, dirty, and somewhat tacky by comparison. Still we had no choice since after being there a week even a menu as wonderful as Ikal's can become a little tiresome. All in all it was an incredible experience. My wife did initially have some problems getting the staff at Ikal make her vegetarian dishes (they always seemed to assume that just meant salad). However, by the end of the week their chef had figured it out and made some nice dishes just for her. Also, be forewarned that paradise has bugs - and lots of them! One of the other guests described it perfectly when he said \"Hey, you are in the jungle after all.\" I was itching for a week after I got back. Paradise also does not come cheap - at 500 per night just for the room it is by far the most expensive hotel we have ever stayed at. However, even after paying that much we both think it was money well spent,- that says a lot about what they do there. In short, Ikal does an amazing job of creating an incredible romantic getaway. From the scenery, to the incredible service, to the luxurious quality of every little detail, you know that they have worked very hard. Kudos to the Ikal staff, we hope to see you again for our five year anniversary!", "Date": "September 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stone Ridge, VA", "Title": "\u201cA perfect spot for rest, relaxation, and rejuvination\u201d", "Author": "sbouldin", "ReviewID": "UR2503411", "Content": "My wife and I spent a week at Ikal in mid August and absolutely loved the place. We went during the hottest part of the year, but we rarely felt uncomfortable with the nice ocean breeze and the air conditioned villas. Speaking of the villas, they are marvelous. We would wake every morning to tea and pastries on our patio and a nice dip in our own personal plunge pool. The garden shower was very romantic and tranquil. The staff was incredible, almost too good. The only negatives were that at times I thought they would try to force you to get a drink. They were almost like salesmen, which I'm sure they're told to do, but when I would say \"No, I don't want a drink,\" they would persist. Other than that though, they were very friendly. We really enjoyed our time with Carlos. The food was very good at the restaurant. They offered many selections at breakfast and dinner and gave really big portions. The Spa was great. Everyone there was friendly and made you feel like you were special. Some people have complained about the beach and it's rocks, but it didn't really hamper us. There are ways to get into the water just fine without needing water shoes. At times it was tricky, but we rarely had problems getting in and out of the water. PROs: top notch resort, beautiful villas, pool, and surrondings, Good food and great service, Excellent spa. CONs: Almost none at all, but sometimes \"too persistent\" staff when it came to drinks bothered us a little. Ikal del Mar is a top notch resort perfet for those looking for true rest and relaxation. Expect to pay a pretty penny, but it's well worth it.

My husband and I were married at Ikal Del Mar on Satuday, July 24, 2004 and it was more beautiful than we ever imagined. We exchanged vows overlooking the crystal blue carribean as the sun was setting. Immediately followed by a cocktail reception with 40 of our family members and closet friends. The staff at Ikal did an amazing job of decorating - the best way to describe it is simple elegance. All of this was made possible because of Abigail and Dinorah. They did an amazing job of coordinating the wedding especially Dinorah. We stayed at Ikal for four nights. Upon arrival we were greeted by Abigail and Dinorah. They were both very kind and adorable. It had taken us longer at the airport than anticipated so in the 30 minute drive from the airport to Ikal they had called the driver at least twice checking on us. That was really comforting. The food was wonderful and the Mojitos are fabulous!! For breakfast you must try the Eggs Ikal, Mexican omlette, and the waffles. Be sure to find Arturo, the manager of Azul. He always made sure everything was perfect at all times. The villas are amazing. One of my favorite things was the bedding. It was sooooo nice. The moon shower was great. I never took a shower inside. I was also surprised of the size of the plunge pool. It was much larger than I anticipated. I could go on for days writing about the beauty and charm of Ikal Del Mar.

What makes the resort is the attention to detail; complimentary coffee & pastries on your doorstep every morning; ice cold face towels on the beach, and an open bar cocktail evening. The most stressful part is counting down the days until you leave! All the staff are fantastic; friendly and generally very efficient (you have to excuse the odd lapse - if you were working there you would find it hard not to slip into the relaxation vibe!). The spa is also first-class, and even on rainy days there's something to look forward to; a thoughtful discount on spa facilities. Food was on the whole great, but be sure to venture out at least once and pay a vist to Playa del Carmen a 10 minute drive away - Ikal has a great list of recommended restaurants. Villas are beautiful, with what you'd expect plus much more; sensational outdoor shower and complimentary (YES!) mini-bar. OK, the beach is a little rocky to get into but it's only a small bit and you can walk just along the beach to avoid it (our advice would be to get some cheap diving shoes from a dive shop or online before you arrive).

We have stayed at many swank hotels - since this was our short but sweet honeymoon I wanted something above and beyond in terms of intimacy, style, and natural beauty. Sometimes those grand hotels get tiresome - and I can't help but feel like I am in Las Vegas - but at the same time, we wanted something luxurious. We found the Ikal to be the perfect answer. Be ready - you do turn off the highway down a dirt road, and there is construction you pass on the way in. You will see two small kind of shabby local resturaunts, and perhaps some dogs wandering (dogs seem to wander all over Mexico, they were not dangerous). But my husband and I felt that we were in a more authentic area of Mexico unlike Cancun so we liked it all the more. Once at the hotel, it is beautiful. The restaurant has no wall on the side of the ocean, each night we had dinner was in the wonderful balmy ocean breeze looking out into the moonlit ocean. The food was wonderful - and I loved that we never saw more than six other couples. The grilled shrimp and jalepeno appetizer was our favorite! We loved our little Bohio or Casita, we loved how large our private terrace was, with our own plunge pool and the outdoor jungle shower was great. It's definitely not for those looking for wild partying - so be careful about that or just make sure you go to Playa del Carmen for that.", "Date": "June 25, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middletown, CT", "Title": "\u201cIkal is a great place - even during floods :)\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2207328", "Content": "Ikal is a great place to relax and get away from it all.

The menu at the restaurant is good but it can get a bit boring after the 3rd time, so I would definitely recommend going into Playa del Carmen for dinner every once in a while. In regards to the flood, I must say that even in an emergency the staff was great. We were taken to the Ritz Carlton in Cancun and comped for almost everything.

Point Blank!!! This place put me back in a frame of mind that I thought was forever lost. From someone who hasn't been on any vacation in 2 years this was THE place to go to celebrate our Honeymoon. Upon arriving we were greeted by Abigail, and she quickly escorted us around the property (to make sure we didn't get lost) and showed us around all the areas and amenities the resort has to offer. This place was so tranquil and peaceful that you felt that you were on a deserted island....except that you had an entire staff that was always there at the snap of a finger. The villas are amazing....the air conditioners work extremely well....I kept ours at 64 degrees....and it never missed a lick. We never had any issues with noise from our or others air-conditioners, so I think that must be something that one deals with on a villa to villa basis. The \"moon shower\" was the highlight of the trip to me. It was hidden well enough that you could take a shower in the middle of the day, or the middle of the night. The water pressure was wonderful and I had what seemed to be an unlimited amount of hot water. It was just such a \"cleansing\" experience to take a shower in the outdoors with all the jungle grown up around you and then be able to look up through the drops of water to see the stars. As a matter of fact, all 6 days we were there I never took a shower inside the villa. I took all of mine outside in the moon shower. It rained for the last 2.5 days we were there, but that never stopped me from still using the moon shower. Taking a shower, in the rain outside isn't something you can do to many times in your life. So that was a huge highlight for me. The soap that was hand made was also a huge hit for me.....I wanted to take the whole bar home with me. The food was first rate...and the review about the \"breakfast enchiladas\" was right on....they were out of this world. You could eat and eat and not feel like you were sick. The food was light yet fullfilling...and as far as the price...yeah it was high....but I want to make a point that I think everyone who has stayed at the resort would agree with. That in order to maintain the high level of service, and the feeling that your all alone at this magnificent place, that you have got to sacrifice quantity and go for quality. So yeah it was expensive, but I realized that I didn't mind paying very high prices for things because there is no way they could operate a facility like that, at that level with those amenities if they didn't charge more. Because they only can have around 60 people at most at any one time, and not 600 or 1000 like other resorts do. The hammocks and plunge pool could not have been better....I must have laid in that hammock with my new wife for at least 24 hours total in the 6 days we were there. You were like in a transe. Well enough babbling...GO...GO...GO...GO...don't worry about price....your going to spend the money somewhere anyway...and this place can really put you back to a state of mind that perhaps no other place could. I give it a 5 of 5 only because there wasn't a 6th option available. Also...look for Luis at the restaurant...he is cool...nice...and funny. He made my trip just the much better...always smiling and happy....we could all learn alot from him. Thanks IKAL....and perhaps for a 1 year we will be back......a truely memorable place that I feel my never be equalled.", "Date": "June 20, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFabulous until the flood\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2186354", "Content": "Beautiful villas set in the jungle.
