Reading some of the reviews on here, I feared the worse, but I didn't think it bad at all. In Europe it would easily pass as a 3* hotel. It wasn't cheap - $143++ per night normally, with a $20 or so surcharge for Chinese New Year, and I haven't really compared it for value for money with other places. The good: * the place is very clean, and my room was well-serviced each day * the room was well-appointed, with most of the amenities you'd expect in a 4* hotel * free wi-fi, worked well * good bus service right outside the door, if you want the bus - 5 mins journey to the MRT * 24-hour reception desk (I think) * good-sized 7-11 nearby (not the tiny one right outside; go around the corner), and some local restauants, if that's your style (not mine). Neutral: * the hotel is well-located for NUS, or presumably for other West Coast business places; otherwise rather out of the way * breakfast was just about adequate * the room wasn't large, but I've stayed in smaller places Bad: * there was a certain 'cheap' feel about the check in/out process (only condescendingly not charging for early check-in, suggesting I leave the card-key at reception when going out, to avoid a $30 lost card charge, having the maid check the room before I could check out?!) * noisy fridge in my room * 'wet room' bathroom - difficult to avoid wet feet after shower; drain gurgled constantly (tip: put two towels over it to muffle the sound)", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cRipoff Hotel\u201d", "Author": "FriendlyLion", "ReviewID": "UR123358616", "Content": "If you want to stay in a 1 star hotel but pay 4 star prices, then this hotel is for you", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cgood clean hotel - small rooms\u201d", "Author": "Koalakaye", "ReviewID": "UR121553974", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for a total of 4 nights. The first night we stayed there we were in a very small room. On our return the room was a little bigger and that was better. It had a small table and little stool, TV, and small fridge, kettle, hair drier. We stayed in room 205 - which is on a corner. It is a very handy hotel to the University. To get to the city you have to catch a bus to get to the MRT train/tube station. Buses go all the time from right out of the front of the hotel and the tubes/trains go every 3 mins. Its an excellent transport system. The hotel is very clean and the room is made up every day. The rooms have lots of TV stations and a little fridge and two free water bottles every day! The breakfast is pretty limited to boiled eggs and toast, oranges or apples, average coffee, and sweet bread/buns. The hotel is quiet and the beds quite hard but we slept well every night. Good aircon too!", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Petaling Jaya, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cJust OK...\u201d", "Author": "Zairol", "ReviewID": "UR119278836", "Content": "I booked 3 night hotel via booking.com for SGD140 pernight.

When I checked in, I noticed that the walk-in rate was SGD 190 or 210, depending on the room. For this considerable sum of money, what do you get? A room that is just big enough to fit one bed. There is no proper table, no chair, and your luggage will just have to rest on the floor. There were some ants and fleas, although (I think) no bedbugs. Internet did not work when I was there. Someone also told me that the night before I checked in, a faulty fire alarm went off three times that night, roughly at one-hour intervals (1 AM, 2 AM, and 3 AM). As for the facilities, there are no facilities except for one washing machine. And the hallways are so narrow that two people would not be able to walk through at the same time without at least brushing shoulders. Also, the doors slam shut very loudly, and some rude mainland Chinese tourist woke me up at 1:20 AM by constantly knocking on the door of her tourist friends, in the room next to mine. (Also, these folks somehow felt that it was acceptable to stand in the doorways and shout between each other's rooms). In short, this felt more like a college dorm than a hotel. The only reason that this miserable hole is able to charge such prices is that it is one of only four very small hotels near NUS or, in fact, anywhere on the West Coast of Singapore. But if you are willing to commute, then for the same money you can get a much better hotel (e.g. the Ibis at Bencoolen) for the same money. Or, you can have the same low quality elsewhere, but for much less money. Another option is to stay in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, just across the water from Singapore, where you can get a 45-square-meter business suite for the same money as you would pay to stay in this college dorm of a hotel. Again, stay away from this ridiculously overpriced, budget-quality (but certainly not \"budget\") rathole.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Delhi", "Title": "\u201cA tiny but clean hotel\u201d", "Author": "crosswordsguy", "ReviewID": "UR95550051", "Content": "Stayed here for 2 days as this hotel was near to my place of work.

In breakfast only some bread, jam, fruits & coffee was available as their is no restaurant in this hotel. Not many restaurants are located nearby but one can try delicious Egg Paratha at \"The Cheese Prata Shop\". This hotel is conveniently located and one can catch a bus from the nearby Bus stop for Clementi MRT station (or recently opened Haw Par Villa MRT station) and travel all across Singapore. Still, its too far from \"Little India\" which is an Indians delight.
