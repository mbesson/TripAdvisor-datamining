The Lark Hotel is 50 mts. away from Insurgentes Ave, the main street that runs the city South/North and the Metrobus station El Chopo (a museum) is the hotel stop. Also you have the Blue Line subway three blocks away. There is an Oxxo store and a huge Walmart on Insurgentes in front of the metrobus station. A great restaurant also on the avenue.The rooms are big enough, newly renovated, kingsize bed with new comfy mattress, super clean. Very good breakfast hot and cold buffet that we had included in our reservation. Taxi to the airport $MP150. You can walk anywhere from this location. If you like to walk of course.", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cA Hidden Jewel off The Beaten Path\u201d", "Author": "ronniebrit", "ReviewID": "UR58069960", "Content": "Not being a novice traveller I wasn't at all afraid to stay off the beaten path during my stay in Mexico City. The Lark Hotel though not located in the more pricy zona rosa district, is still only a stone's throw from the elegant Paseo de la Reforma, from which one can easily reach any major part of the city. It is also a very short walk from the metro stop \"Revolucion\", as well as right next to the Metrobus, all of which make up for the fact that it isn't in the center of town. At the price I paid ($33.00) a night, I was shocked at the size and cleanliness of the room as well as the amenities (complementary bottles of water). Although the hotel restaurant offers a full, very reasonably priced menu, I found a wonderful local restaurant five minuets away -Cafe Estaciones- located on the Heroes Ferrocarrileros 28-A, which offered a wide selection of local and international cuisine, as well as very friendly and excellent service. The Lark Hotel is truly a hidden jewel and I intend to make it my hotel of choice on my future frequent trips to Mexico City.", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles, ca", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - Great Place to stay\u201d", "Author": "coolz1998", "ReviewID": "UR24450538", "Content": "This hotel is close to the Metro (SUBWAY) Stop (REVOLUCION) Is a very nice hotel for the price - the room interior is very nice decorated and very comfortable - the personel is very helpful and it has a nice restaurant in the lobby.
