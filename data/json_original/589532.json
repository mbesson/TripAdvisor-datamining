It was just perfect! Great position only 2 mins wak from the Metro which links you to the centre in 10 mins. The hotel concierge were helpful and efficient. The decor of the hotel was smart, spotlessly clean and worthy of its 4* rating. I was given a superior room on 5th floor. The room was absolutely beautiful. The furnishings were like a 5* property - the bed solarge and comfortable with crisp white linen, changed every day. A beautifully designed marble bathroom with toiletries including toothbrush and hairbrush!! I am a very critical person when it comes to hotel rooms, and I had absoslutely no cause to complain with the Jardin Metroolitano. I suggest you opt for the Bed and Breakfast rate, as the breakfast was really EXCELLENT. Fresh choices of bread, fresh fruit - strawberries, melon, kiwis, oranges - meat, cheese, fresh omelettes or eggs of your choice and even a Diet corner with soya milk and sugar free products......the best european breakfast I have had in a city in a long time!! Overall I would strongly recommend this hotel for your city break - it was conveniently situated, and quiet, in great location.....and so so beautifully maintained!!

The room was cleaned daily and was spotless, even though we caused a bit of mess (buying food from the local supermarket and leaving crumbs in various places). Staff were helpful - providing us with extra wine glasses etc when we asked. The location was also really good - not in the city centre but on a direct line so we had a 1 min walk to the tube and then maybe 7-10 min tube ride to Plaza del Sol. It was also on the direct line for museums, city parks, shopping etc. My only moan would be there were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room. However there is an excellent coffee shop nect door where you can get cafe con leche and other such drinks very cheaply. Would I stay here again?

But tourists should not worry, a large metro (subway) station is just across the road and serves three of Madrid's major tube lines (so it is only a matter of four or five stations to reach most tourist hot spots). The rooms are large, airy, modern, well equipped and well maintained. There is plenty of storage space and the decor is modern and relaxed. The free wifi connection is a bit slow (and maybe not very secure according to my firewall program) but it works. BBC, SKY and Al Jazeera serve the English-speaking TV audience needs, and there are French, German and Spanish TV channels as well. Next to the highly professional and helpful reception staff area is a snack bar open day and half the night. And through its doors is the entrance to the international cuisine restaurant. There is a secure parking garage under the hotel (and using it can add 20% to your daily bill).

Piped music in the room and beautiful big mirror added to the overall ambience. There was also a private balcony off the room but it was very small unfortunately and not large enough to sit out on.

The staff was helpful and friendly, which is good because I had so many questions and requests while I was there that I was glad that they weren't annoyed with me. The decor throughout the hotel looks a bit dated, but the bathrooms seem to be remodeled. The balcony windows, once shut, block out all of the traffic noise--they were incredibly well insulated.
