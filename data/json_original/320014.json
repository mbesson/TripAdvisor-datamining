The kitchen is sparsely equipped, to an equivalent level of what you'd expect an extended stay hotel to provide in th US or Europe (plus the rice cooker :-) 2. The apartments are equipped with a washing-drying machine, drying clothesline, ironing board and iron. You will need to change your clothes frequently in this hot and humid weather. Unless you travel heavy, you'll have to wash 3. The swimming pool. Not for toddlers (it starts at 1 meter), but great for kids, and parents who want a swim or linger in the sun. Never crowded and very quiet. The kids could not have enough of it. 4. The transportation options. The Clarque Quay subway station is a 5-10 minutes walk away, there a bus stations all around the hotel, and a taxi station as well. 5. The location. The Quays are behind the hotel, for a great evening walk either in the Clarque Quay complex or more quietly by the river banks. Under the hotel are a grocery shop and 2 food courts (a Kopitiam and a smaller Japanese court by the grocery shop). 6.

My family of 13 booked 3 two bedroom apartments and the accomodation was great. Clean rooms, fully equipped with the kitchenette and dining area. Worked well for a family with teenagers, nice and roomy. The rooms we got had great views of the city. The staff at reception were very friendly and helpful. We were able to check in early to one of the rooms that was already free which helped a lot since we arrived in singapore at 7am. They gave good directions when we wanted to go places, they gave us a wheelchair for free for the duration of the stay as we had an injured family member with us. The other great thing was the free Wi-fi in the hotel and free internet on a computer at reception. The downside of thehotel is that they offer a very basic continental breakfast which makes sense given that it is more serviced apartments than a hotel. There is a 24hr McDonalds and shopping centre adjacent to the hotel which offered alternatives to the hotel breakfast. The hotel also has a large swimming pool which is great for cooling off after a long day. Singapore is hot and humid. Overall Singapore is a great place to visit, good metro system. The nearest MRT to the hotel is at Clarke Quay through the shopping centre \"The Central\" which is about 10 min walk. Otherwise the bus stop is just across the street from the hotel. The is also a taxi stop just outside the hotel and taxis in singapore are generally very affordable. Must visit places: Night Safari, Little India, Sentosa Island (we did not manage to get tickets to Universal Studios because of the peak season), Orchard Road, Mustafa's (24hr shop in Little India - perfumes go for a song!).

Location is superb. Staff excellent.

I recommend the premier units to guarantee the view. Living are is small. main bedroom was extra large - could have used some of that space in the living room. 2BR is fine. Only downside was the clothes washer/drier in the kitchen which is very noisy and annoying when trying to relax with a movie after a day with hypo kids!! Kitchen also small but we were only preparing food for kids so we didn't care. Taxi ranks 2 mins walk away and never a problem. other taxi ranks at clark quay itself but on weekend nights they are hard to get. 7/11 1min walk. Cold storage supermarket 5 mins walk away. And japanese supermarket (which caters all western shopping also) just 10 mins walk. Good cheap asian restaurant downstairs for eat in or take out. Universal still not fully opened (in fact nothing has changed since I was there in May) but still a great day. The Mummy ride is worth it. As always, attractions in Singapore are plentiful such as Sentosa, Night Safari, zoo, bird park etc etc But finding some new ones this time such as Science Park which is fantastic for younger kids. Visited there just for a look and stayed 5 hours. Next door is snow world which is also fun but not a lot to do there besides one hill sled option. They supply the snow clothes free. Wet Wet wild waterpark is also great for kids. And the botanical gardens has a lot to offer once you start walking all around it. If staying at Somerset Liang Court, dont miss the kite flying at night....this is amazing to watch - and free! This is done in the park over the bridge - 5 mins walk and starts around 7.30pm. You cant do it yourself but its great and very colorful to watch at night. There is a workshop in the building next door which you can buy the kites etc and also sit for free and try your hand at simulators. its not easy! The location of this hotel puts you right on top of clark quay which is packed with restaurants and bars and has a great atmosphere. Some really lovely places to eat and drink beside the river. Dont miss the night show by the water on Sentosa - 7pm and 8pm shows. And the new Marina Bay Sands building is a must to go atop and walk around. You have free wireless internat to as a bonus and the speed is ok. had only 2 free breakfasts as its not a lot to get excited about but with the supermarkets so close, we stocked with food we liked.

The bottom line is that we were not disappointed. The two bedroom apartment was excellent; spacious, clean, comfortable and conveniently located. The staff are polite and very helpful \u2013 more later. The inclusive breakfast, whilst not the 5star buffet that comes with the equivalent hotel, was more than adequate to start the day. If you are looking for good accommodation which is more flexible and spacious than a hotel room and good value for money, in what is an expensive city, these apartments should be high on your list. The apartments are located next to the NovoHotel and a matter of yards from to Clark Quay. It is central for public transport \u2013 Clark Quay is the nearest metro train station about 400/500 yards from the apartment. We considered taking the train from the airport but decided upon a taxi \u2013 which was reasonably priced. If you are travelling light then use the train but I wouldn\u2019t want to haul heavy cases from the train station to the apartments. There are an abundance of bars and restaurants near to the apartments and taxis are cheap to try the wide variety of eating options this city offers. This was our second visit to Singapore and we knew alcoholic drinks are expensive compared to home. However, we arrived on St Patricks Day in time to join in the party at Mulligan\u2019s bar on Clark Quay to find Guinness at a mere 12 Dollars a pint - \u00a36 sterling and Tiger Beer isn\u2019t far behind. AA must be struggling for members in this city! During our stay we did not self cater but there is a large supermarket in the basement of Liang Court, the shopping centre that adjoins the apartments. This can also be accessed via the apartment lifts to B2 which is the car part and walking up the ramp to the supermarket. We took the Hippo / Duck tour of the city \u2013 about 33 dollars for a two day pass which lasts 48 hours from the time of purchase. This is a hop on hop off bus with two different routes covering the city. The pass includes a boat trip from Clark Quay. The company operates several other sightseeing tours. We found these tours value for money \u2013 once you had been around for the full tour you can select the areas you want to explore on foot and use the bus to access them. As for eating we tried the local street food in China Town \u2013 avoiding the Bullfrog and Pigs intestines or at least I think we did. Anyway it was tasty, cheap and went well with the Tiger. We would recommend the STREET cafe/ restaurant next to the apartment (turn right and right again out of the apartment block) \u2013 access via Liang Court. It has a wide range of local food at reasonable prices. A visit to Lau Pa Sat \u2013 the hawker food court is a must with its vast array of food and eating options. We visited the Outback Steakhouse at Suntec City based on our visits to that chain in the USA \u2013 a standard fare even though the steaks did not match those of the US. Still, a pleasant meal and the obliging staff suitably embarrassed our son whose birthday it was with a rendition of Happy Birthday. Whilst on the subject of our son\u2019s birthday we arrived back at the apartment to find the management presented our son with a birthday cake and card. A nice touch and greatly appreciated \u2013 you don\u2019t see this kind of treatment in UK hotels, at least not the ones we have visited. We were recommended to visit the Swiss Hotel next to Raffles \u2013 the views of the city from the Bar/ Lounge on the 70 / 72 floor are stunning, especially at night. Being so close to Raffles you have to do the tourist thing and visit the Long Bar for a Singapore Sling. Yes they do throw the peanut shells on the floor and charge a mere 25 dollars a pop for the famous drink plus service charge. The new Universal Studios Park on Sentosa Island opened during our visit but we found that tickets had to be pre-booked and you could not get same day entry. No doubt when the initial novelty has worn off access on the same day will be as usual \u2013 but check before taking a taxi out there Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our four days in Singapore and have no hesitation in recommending these apartments \u2013 they would be our first choice on any future visit.

So recommend if you want to stay in this location", "Date": "November 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cGreat location - spacy appartments\u201d", "Author": "TigiCopenhagen", "ReviewID": "UR47551241", "Content": "Our family had 2 two-bedroom appartments.

One night in a deluxe and 3 nights in an executive apartment. The deluxe apartment has a double and a ingle bedroom, the executive a double and a twin, so we had to improvise a bit the first night (BTW we booked an extra night, but the execs were sold out). Both apartment types are roomy, the exec a bit more than deluxe. Location is good, near the restaurants at the quais and on top of a japanese oriented shopping center. If the japanese supermarket is too expensive, then there are other ones nearby. The swimming pool that it shares wiith the novotel is large (and deep!) and you get 20 % discount on your novotel restaurant bills. Fun to do: make your own pewter disk at the Selangor School of hard knocks nearby. Have a beer at the microbrewery \"Brewerkz, also around the corner.", "Date": "August 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, generous living accomodation\u201d", "Author": "TheWarbs", "ReviewID": "UR38442919", "Content": "Stayed here from the 11th to 20th August 2009. Could not believe the size of the apartment. Kitchen and washing machine a great help when travelling with teenagers who always want to wear the same t-shirt!! Rooms were clean, housekeeping very good. Great location on the side of Clarke Quay and close to china town and Bugis. Lots of places to eat and easy access to MRT and buses. Reception staff always welcome you back. Breakfast was a little strange kids did not like it very much but once you get used to soup for breakfast it was fine, could do with more tables and chairs as it did become crowded. Building work was taking place but only during the day so if you are out all day like we were then it does not affect you. Pool was lovely lots of sunbeds and towels were soft and clean.

Location was very convenient to walk to Clarke Quay MRT station, take one of two bridges across the river, 10 minutes at a leisurely stroll. Chinatown precinct is within walking distance. Clarke Quay is lined with many trendy restaurants and bars (nightclubs), and obviously a popular venue for youth come weekends. Noise was never an issue. Somerset Liang Court has a breakfast bar included in some packages, with a simple selection of toast, cereals, pastries and a different hot dish every morning. The staff were some of the friendliest people we met during our stay. Traveling at the peak of H1N1 concerns, we were precautiously quarantined at the children's hospital on our final day. The staff arranged for our luggage to be forwarded to the hospital quicker than if we had done it ourselves. I even received a phone call from the front desk, once back home to ask if everything was OK with our son, and that some staff had even considered coming to visit us at the hospital if we had been forced to stay overnight.

We got a bargain on wotif, $188 (Aus) for a night, we stayed for 7 nights and thought our choice was fantastic as we travelled with a toddler. There is a small shopping mall (liang court) with supermarket right next door, the mall has quite a number of places to eat, and there is Clarke Quay eateries on your doorstep!!!! The shopping mall had a taxi rank right near the Somerset, and on the other side of the mall there is a free shuttle bus to a few places. Also the liang court mall had a Children's play gym - Royce's Play Gyms (?) - It was fantastic - air- con, SUPER super clean. The Clarke Quay MRT is close by too - but we just used the taxi as they were cheap enough - only $17 to get to airport and I think it was less than that to get to the zoo. Never had to wait for a taxi - they are already lined up. The staff are pleasant and helpful - and they loved kids. The apartment was bigger than I expected heaps of room for little ones. The only issue we had was the toilet in the main bathroom was leaking - it was promptly attended to. Oh and there was an issue with our late checkout fee, but once I contacted the Somerset reservations this was promptly cleared up.", "Date": "June 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent choice and good value\u201d", "Author": "Tam Carr", "ReviewID": "UR31821750", "Content": "We decided to choose a serviced apartment rather than a hotel as it was a cheaper option than 2 double rooms. We were 2 adult couples and Somerset Liang Court was perfect for our needs in every respect. The location immediately next to Clarke Quay is great and with all those bars / restaurants and also a shopping mall on your doorstep it was a perfect base. The apartment was fitted with all the items we needed and more. The washing machine was ideal for catching up with all the dirty laundry that had accumulated over our travels. The small kitchen was housed with oven, hob and microwave too. Wi-fi Internet was available in the apartment at a charge but was free to use in the Residents lounge on the 8th floor. This was also where we ate breakfast. Cable TV channels included all the usual popular ones and a dvd player was also there. The rooms were all spacious and the master bedroom was ensuite. Bedroom 2 was adjacent to the second bathroom / toilet. Cleanliness was very good as was the air-con. Breakfast was very basic but enough to get you going in the morning and keep you going until lunchtime. The Somerset Liang Court shares a swimming pool with the Novotel next door and towels and drinks / snack service is availabel poolside. We would definitely recommend this place as a more relaxing place to stay than a hotel room and especially for families or 2 couples.
